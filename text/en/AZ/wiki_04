<text>Jean Schwartz (November 4, 1878 – November 30, 1956) was a Hungarian-born Jewish American composer and pianist. He is best known for his work writing the scores for more than 30 Broadway musicals, and for his creation of more than 1,000 popular songs with the lyricist William Jerome. Schwartz and Jerome also performed together on the vaudeville stage in the United States; sometimes in collaboration with Maude Nugent, Jerome&#x27;s wife, and the Dolly Sisters. Schwartz was married to Jenny Dolly from 1913 to 1921.

With Jerome, Schwartz created a large body of work for both Broadway and Tin Pan Alley, with the majority of their songs written between the years 1901 and 1910. Many of their popular songs were interpolated into Broadway musicals created by others during the 1900s, 1910s, and 1920s. The pair were also the primary creators of eight Broadway musicals, the most successful of which were &quot;Piff! Paff!! Pouf!!!&quot; (1904) and &quot;The Ham Tree&quot; (1905). Their most enduring song, &quot;Chinatown, My Chinatown&quot;, was written in 1906, interpolated into their final musical together, &quot;Up and Down Broadway&quot; (1910), and became a jazz standard when a series of recording artists, including Louis Armstrong and Fletcher Henderson, made popular recordings of the work. Their collaborative output slowed significantly after 1910 and came to an end during World War I.

While Schwartz was mainly concerned with writing the music to his songs, he did on occasion work as a lyricist as well. He was a founding member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers in 1914. Schwartz formed a prolific partnership with the lyricist and playwright Harold Atteridge with whom he created more than a dozen Broadway musicals. Many of these shows were also made with the composer Sigmund Romberg. The trio of Schwartz, Atteridge, and Romberg created five of &quot;The Passing Show&quot; musical revues together as well as the musicals &quot;Monte Cristo, Jr.&quot; (1919) and &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; (1924). Schwartz also created several Broadway musicals in collaboration with the lyricist Alfred Bryan; sometimes in conjunction with Atteridge as musical book writer.

Schwartz collaborated with many other songwriters during his lengthy career. He wrote the 1918 popular standard &quot;Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody&quot; with Sam M. Lewis and Joe Young. In 1930, he intentionally ended his career as a New York City based songwriter with the aptly named &quot;Au Revoir Pleasant Dreams&quot;, a work which became the theme song for Ben Bernie and his orchestra. After this, he lived in retirement in Los Angeles and was mostly finished with music making. His final song of significance, the 1937 popular standard &quot;Trust in Me&quot;, was written in collaboration with Milton Ager and Ned Wever. That song has been recorded by numerous artists, most recently by Beyonce for the 2008 film &quot;Cadillac Records&quot;. He was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.

==Early life and career==
Jean Schwartz was born into a Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary on November 4, 1878. At the age of 13, he immigrated with his family to the United States and settled with them in New York City. The family lived on the East Side, and he studied the piano under his older sister, Rosa, who had trained as a pianist under Franz Liszt.

After working for a time as an office boy at a cigar factory and as an attendant at a Turkish bath house, Schwartz obtained employment in the sheet music department of the Siegel-Cooper Company, where his job was to play songs on the piano for customers in order to sell the sheet music. It was while working in this job that he published his first song, the ragtime piece &quot;Dusky Dudes&#x27; Cakewalk&quot;, in 1899. Other music jobs he held in his early years included working as a pianist with an orchestra at Coney Island and as a song-plugger for the Shapiro-Bernstein Publishing House of Tin Pan Alley.

Schwartz became a citizen of the United States in 1902. In 1914, he was one of the twelve founding members of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.

==Work with William Jerome==

Schwartz remained at the Siegel-Cooper Company until 1901 when he took a job as the on-stage pianist in John Stromberg&#x27;s Broadway musical &quot;Hoity Toity&quot; at Weber &amp; Fields Music Hall. His energy and enthusiasm on stage attracted the attention of the show&#x27;s librettist, William Jerome, and the two ended up becoming friends. In the midst of &quot;Hoity Toity&quot; run, the two men wrote their first song together, &quot;Mr. Shakespeare Comes to Town&quot;, and the tune was added into that production under the pseudonym John Black. It was a popular hit with audiences.

Schwartz went on to write more than 1,000 popular songs with Jerome; many of them written for or first performed on the Broadway stage. The pair regularly contributed additional songs and other material to musicals primarily written by others. One of their early songs, &quot;Mr. Dooley&quot;, was first performed in George Dance and Howard Talbot&#x27;s musical &quot;A Chinese Honeymoon&quot; (1902), and was a popular enough hit that it was also included in the first musical version of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1902). Most of their early songs were comedic works; including musical theatre songs written for the comedians George M. Cohan, Al Jolson, Eddie Foy, Harry Bulger, and Thomas Q. Seabrooke. The pair then began to expand their repertoire into writing ballads, with an important early success being the song &quot;Bedalia&quot; written for Blanche Ring in Reginald De Koven and George V. Hobart&#x27;s &quot;The Jersey Lily&quot; (1903). This song&#x27;s sheet music sold more than three million copies. The pair also contributed songs to the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies,&quot; among other shows.

In 1903, Schwartz and Jerome wrote their first of eight musicals together where they were the primary authors, &quot;Mrs. Delaney of Newport&quot;. This was followed by their biggest success as musical theatre writers, &quot;Piff! Paff!! Pouf!!!&quot;, in 1904. The song &quot;Radium Dance&quot; from this show was inspired by scientist Marie Curie, and the musical was a big hit for its stars, Eddie Foy and Alice Fischer. They scored another popular hit with the musical &quot;The Ham Tree&quot;, which was created for the vaudeville stars James McIntyre and Thomas Heath. A tremendous success, the production toured for seven years and was later periodically revived by McIntyre and Heath.

Schwartz and Jerome&#x27;s other show from 1905, &quot;Lifting the Lid&quot;, was their first collaboration with the playwright John J. McNally. McNally penned the books to several other Schwartz and Jerome Broadway musicals, including &quot;Fritz in Tammany Hall&quot; (1905), &quot;Lola from Berlin&quot; (1907), and &quot;In Hayti&quot; (1909). Their final musical together, &quot;Up and Down Broadway&quot; (1910), included their biggest hit as songwriters, &quot;Chinatown, My Chinatown&quot;. Originally written in 1906, this song was interpolated into the musical. This song, however, did not become a popular hit until it was recorded by the American Quartet and Billy Murray in late 1914 on their number one selling record. It then became a jazz standard and was recorded by numerous artists over the next several decades; among them Louis Armstrong and Fletcher Henderson.

Schwartz and Jerome also wrote several popular songs not attached to musicals. Their 1901 comedic song &quot;Rip Van Winkle Was a Lucky Man&quot; was a hit for both African-American singer Sherman H. Dudley, and Jerome&#x27;s wife, Maude Nugent. Their song &quot;Dear Sing Sing&quot; (1903) was a hit for Billy Murray who recorded the song multiple times. Their comedic song &quot;I&#x27;m a Member of the Midnight Crew&quot; (1909) became a hit for several performers of the era; including Carter DeHaven and Eddie Morton. Some of their other hit songs included &quot;Since Sister Nell heard Paderewski Play&quot; (1901), &quot;I&#x27;m Unlucky&quot; (1902) &quot;Hamlet Was a Melancholy Dane&quot; (1902), &quot;Cordelia Malone&quot; (1904), and &quot;The Hat My Father Wore on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day&quot; (1909), among many others.

After 1910, Schwartz and Jerome&#x27;s collaborative output significantly dropped as they began to increasingly pursue projects independent of one another; and despite briefly operating their own publishing firm in the years leading up to World War I, their partnership came to an end during the war years. However, songs the pair had written earlier in their career continued to be interpolated into musicals, and performed by recording artists after their partnership had ended. The pair re-united briefly in 1921 with the song &quot;Molly on a Trolley by Golly With You&quot;, which was published by M. Witmark &amp; Sons.

Schwartz and Jerome were also active as performers on the vaudeville stage together, and they sometimes worked in collaboration with Maude Nugent and the Dolly Sisters. Jenny Dolly was Schwartz&#x27;s first wife.

==Other work on Broadway==

In 1909, Schwartz began to work on musical theatre projects without Jerome, beginning with the Harry B. Smith musical &quot;The Silver Star,&quot; for which he was one of several credited primary composers. He formed a partnership with the lyricist Harold Atteridge, with their first major work together being the 1913 musical &quot;The Honeymoon Express&quot;. The two men then went on to work for the Shubert family in &quot;The Passing Show&quot; musical revue series, joining the composer Sigmund Romberg to create &quot;The Passing Show of 1913&quot;. The same creative trio was later re-united to create &quot;The Passing Show of 1918&quot;, &quot;The Passing Show of 1919&quot;, &quot;The Passing Show of 1923&quot;, &quot;The Passing Show of 1924&quot;, and the musicals &quot;Monte Cristo, Jr.&quot; (1919) and &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; (1924).

Schwartz joined playwright Anne Caldwell to create the 1914 Broadway musical &quot;When Claudia Smiles&quot;. He was the composer for &quot;Shubert Gaieties of 1919&quot; with Atteridge being one of several contributing writers to the show&#x27;s book and Alfred Bryan as lyricist. He collaborated with Bryan on another musical that year, &quot;Hello, Alexander&quot; (1919), which was a major re-working of &quot;The Ham Tree&quot;. This heavily revised work supplanted most of the earlier work by Jerome with new lyrics by Bryan and a new book by Edgar Smith. The Schwartz and Bryan team followed this with &quot;The Midnight Rounders of 1920&quot; and &quot;The Century Revue&quot; (1920). Atteridge joined the creative team of Schwartz and Bryan for &quot;The Midnight Rounders of 1921&quot;, and both Atteridge and Schwartz were part of a larger number of creatives behind &quot;The Mimic World&quot; (1921).

Schwartz and Atteridge collaborated with Eddie Cantor to create the 1922 musical &quot;Make It Snappy&quot;. The pair joined composer Al Goodman and playwright Harry Wagstaff Gribble to create &quot;Topics of 1923&quot;. Schwartz and Atteridge re-united with Bryan for the musical &quot;A Night in Spain&quot; (1927). Schwartz&#x27;s final Broadway musical, &quot;Sunny Days&quot; (1928), was made with writers Clifford Grey and William Carey Duncan.

==Later life in California==
In 1930, Schwartz ended his lengthy association with Tin Pan Alley and Broadway; publishing his last song written in New York, the aptly named &quot;Au Revoir Pleasant Dreams&quot;, as an intentional finale to his career as a New York City songwriter and composer. This song was written with lyricist Jack Meskill and was recorded by Ben Bernie and his orchestra. Bernie used the song as his theme song for his radio program.

Schwartz then moved to Los Angeles, California where he mostly retired from songwriting. He wrote one last hit song, &quot;Trust in Me&quot;, in collaboration with Ned Wever and Milton Ager. This song was first popularized in separate recordings made in 1937 by Mildred Bailey and Wayne King. It has been recorded by numerous artists, including Beyoncé in the 2008 film &quot;Cadillac Records&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Schwartz married the actress, singer, and dancer Jenny Dolly of the Dolly Sisters in 1913. They divorced in 1921. Jean Schwartz died in Sherman Oaks, California on November 30, 1956 at the age of 78. He was survived by his second wife Sally Schwartz. He was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.

<text>William Jerome Flannery, September 30, 1865 – June 25, 1932) was an American songwriter, born in Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York, of Irish immigrant parents, Mary Donnellan and Patrick Flannery. He collaborated with numerous well-known composers and performers of the era but is best remembered for his decade-long association with Jean Schwartz with whom he created many popular songs and musical shows in the 1900s and early 1910s.

==Early career==
By the time he was seventeen, Jerome was singing and dancing in vaudeville. He toured with minstrel shows and performed in blackface. He met Eddie Foy while on tour and they became friends; the two would work together often throughout their careers. By the late 1880s Jerome was performing as a parody-singer at Tony Pastor&#x27;s. He also began to write songs and his efforts met with some success. In 1891, Jerome composed &quot;He Never Came Back&quot;, sung by Foy in the musical &quot;Sinbad&quot;, which became the hit of the show. Throughout the 1890s he continued to perform, and his reputation as a lyricist grew gradually. He wrote &quot;My Pearl is a Bowery Girl&quot; (1894) with Andrew Mack which became a number one record for Dan W. Quinn.

He met and married another vaudeville singer, Maude Nugent, probably in the early 1890s. He and Nugent had at least one child, Florence, born in 1896.

Jerome is sometimes credited with suggesting the bicycle lyric of &quot;Daisy Bell&quot; (1892) to Harry Dacre.

==Collaboration with Schwartz==
His first collaboration with songwriter Jean Schwartz was the coon song, &quot;When Mr. Shakespeare Comes to Town&quot;, in 1901.

The duo came up with &quot;Mr. Dooley&quot;, which was interpolated into the 1902 American staging of the London musical &quot;A Chinese Honeymoon&quot;. &quot;Chinese Honeymoon&quot; was successful and &quot;Mr. Dooley&quot; became popular. Later that year the song was interpolated into the musical &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, extending its popularity. &quot;Mr. Dooley&quot; reputedly sold over a million copies. 

Their next big hit was &quot;Bedelia&quot; (1903). Interpolated into &quot;The Jersey Lily&quot; and sung by Blanche Ring, it sold over three million copies. By 1904, &quot;Bedelia&quot; had been recorded by four different artists on the three major phonograph labels.

In 1904 they scored the musical &quot;Piff! Paff!! Pouf!!!&quot;, starring Foy. They went on to score seven more musicals together.

Jerome and Schwartz became two of the best-recognized songwriters of the first decade of the 20th century with numerous popular songs to their credit such as &quot;My Irish Molly-O&quot; (1905), &quot;Handle Me With Care&quot; (1907), &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; and &quot;Meet Me in Rose Time, Rosie&quot; (1908). Although it was not an immediate success, &quot;Chinatown, My Chinatown&quot; (1906) is considered by some to be their biggest hit. Four years after it was written, it was interpolated into &quot;Up and Down Broadway&quot; by Foy; another five years passed and it became a national hit record. It went on to become a jazz standard.

In 1911, Jerome and Schwartz formed their own sheet music publishing company. They chiefly published titles with music by Schwartz, many with lyrics by Jerome—such as &quot;If It Wasn&#x27;t for the Irish and the Jews&quot; (1912)—but also many with lyrics by Grant Clarke. Jerome also began to work more with other composers: in 1912 he wrote the lyrics of &quot;Row, Row, Row&quot; (music by James V. Monaco) for the Ziegfeld Follies; in 1913, he worked with Andrew B. Sterling and Harry Von Tilzer to write lyrics for &quot;On the Old Fall River Line&quot;, and with Von Tilzer again on &quot;And the Green Grass Grew All Around&quot;. Jerome and Schwartz worked as a team less and less and gradually both moved on.

==Later career==
After he and Schwartz went their separate ways, Jerome continued to collaborate on songs with some of the best-known composers in the business. In 1920 he wrote the lyrics for &quot;That Old Irish Mother of Mine&quot;, music by Von Tilzer, which he dedicated to the memory of his mother. Again with Von Tilzer he wrote &quot;Old King Tut&quot; (1923); with Charles Tobias and Larry Shay he wrote &quot;Get Out and Get Under the Moon&quot; (1928).

He continued to publish sheet music without Schwartz and in 1917 published the enormously successful &quot;Over There&quot; for George M. Cohan; he eventually sold the publishing rights to the song to Leo Feist for $25,000, the most ever paid for a song at the time. On the strength of his Broadway comedy writing credentials, he was recruited by Mack Sennett as a writer for the Keystone Film Company. He was among the first board members (1914–1925) of the American Society of Authors, Composers and Publishers (ASCAP).

William Jerome was struck by a car in the spring of 1932 and died June 25 in Newburgh, New York.

<text>The synurids (order Synurales) are a small group of heterokont algae, found mostly in freshwater environments, characterized by cells covered in silica scales.

==Characteristics==

They are covered in silicate scales and spines. In &quot;Synura&quot;, these are formed on the surface of the chloroplasts, two of which are usually present, but sometimes only one divided into two lobes is seen. The cells have two heterokont flagella, inserted parallel to one another at the anterior, whose ultrastructure is a distinguishing characteristic of the group. Both asexual and isogamous sexual reproduction occur.

==Morphology==
[[File:2023 Synurophyte.svg|center|thumb|upright=2|

==Classification==
Synurales are divided into three families, each with one genus:
* Family [[Mallomonadaceae]] 
** &quot;[[Mallomonas]]&quot; 
* Family [[Synuraceae]] 
** &quot;[[Synura]]&quot; 
* Family [[Neotessellaceae]] 
** &quot;[[Neotessella]]&quot; (=&quot;Tessella&quot; )

==History==
The genus &quot;Synura&quot; was proposed in 1834 by the German microscopist [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg]] (1795–1876).

The synurids were originally included among the [[golden alga]]e in the order [[Ochromonadales]] as the family Mallomonadaceae or as the family Synuraceae
. They were formally defined as a separate group by Andersen in 1987, who placed them in their own class Synurophyceae, based on an earlier approach of more narrowly defining major lineages of chrysophyte algae by British phycologist David Hibberd.

The [[Chrysophyceae]] and Synurophyceae are currently recognized as closely related taxa within the [[Stramenopile]]s. Present classifications include the synurids as an order (Synurales) within [[Chrysophyceae]].

<doc id="199292" wikidata="Q173310" url="?curid=199292" title="Kirkuk">
<text>Kirkuk (; ; ; ) is a major city in northern Iraq, serving as the capital of the Kirkuk Governorate. The city is home to a diverse population of Kurds, Iraqi Turkmens and Arabs. Kirkuk sits on the ruins of the original Kirkuk Citadel which sits near the Khasa River.

It is described by the Kurdish leader and former Iraqi president Jalal Talabani as “the Jerusalem of Kurdistan”, while it is seen by the Turkmen activist Fatih Salah as the cultural and historical capital of Iraqi Turkmens. The government of Iraq states that Kirkuk represents a small version of Iraq due to its diverse population, and that the city is a model for coexistence in the country.

==Etymology==
The ancient name of Kirkuk was the Hurrian &quot;Arrapha&quot; During the Parthian era, a &quot;Korkura/Corcura&quot; () is mentioned by Ptolemy, which is believed to refer either to Kirkuk or to the site of Baba Gurgur from the city. Since the Seleucid Empire it was known as &quot;karkā d-ḇeṯ slōḵ&quot; (), which means &#x27;Citadel of the House of Seleucid&#x27; in Mesopotamian Aramaic, the lingua franca of the Fertile Crescent in that era.

The region around Kirkuk was known historically in the Eastern Aramaic and Syriac Assyrian sources as &quot;Beth Garmai&quot; (). The name &quot;Beth Garmai&quot; or &quot;Beth Garme&quot; may be of Syriac origin which meaning &quot;the house of bones&quot;, which is thought to be a reference to bones of slaughtered Achaemenids after a decisive battle between Alexander the Great and Darius III on the plains between the Upper Zab and Diyala river. It was one of a number of independent Neo-Assyrian states which flourished during the Parthian empire (150 BC–226 AD).

It is also thought that region was known during the Parthian and Sassanid periods as &quot;Garmakan&quot;, which means the &#x27;Land of Warmth&#x27; or the &#x27;Hot Land&#x27;. In Persian &quot;Garm&quot; means warm;

After the 7th century, Muslim writers used the name &quot;Kirkheni&quot; (Syriac for &quot;citadel&quot;) to refer to the city. Others used other variant, such as &quot;Bajermi&quot; (a corruption of Aramaic &quot;B&#x27;th Garmayeh&quot; or &quot;Jermakan&quot; (a corruption of Persian Garmakan) .

==History==
===Ancient history===
It is suggested that Kirkuk was one of the places occupied by Neanderthals based on archeological findings in the Shanidar Cave settlement. A large amount of pottery shards dating to the Ubaid period were also excavated from several Tells in the city.

===Early Bronze===
====Akkadian Period====
Ancient Arrapkha was a part of Sargon of Akkad&#x27;s Akkadian Empire (2335–2154 BC), and city was exposed to the raids of the Lullubi during Naram-Sin&#x27;s reign.

====Gutian Period====
Later the city was occupied around 2150 BC by language Isolate speaking Zagros Mountains dwellers who were known as the Gutian people by the Semitic and Sumerian of Mesopotamians. Arraphkha was the capital of the short-lived Guti kingdom (Gutium).

====Ur III Period====
The Gutians were driven from Mesopotamia by the Neo-Sumerian Empire c. 2115 BC.

===Middle Bronze===
Arrapkha became a part of the Old Assyrian Empire (c.2025–1750 BC), before Hammurabi briefly subjected Assyria to the short-lived Babylonian Empire, after which it again became a part of Assyria c.1725 BC.

===Late Bronze===
====Mitanni Period====
However, by the middle of the 2nd millennium B.C. the Indo-Aryan Mittani of Anatolia formed a ruling class over the language isolate speaking Hurrians, and began to expand into a Hurri-Mitanni Empire. In the 1450s they attacked Assyria, sacking Assur, and bringing the cities of Gasur and Arrapkha under their control. From c.1450 to 1393 BC the kings of Assyria paid tribute to the kingdom of Mittani.

====Assyrian Period====
The Middle Assyrian Empire (1365–1020 BC) overthrew the Hurri-Mitanni in the mid 14th century BC. Arrapha became part of Assyria proper, whith the Hurrian population driven away from the region. In the 11th and 10th centuries BC the city rose to prominence, becoming an important city in Assyria until the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–605 BC).

===Iron Age===
It remained as such throughout the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–605 BC) where it became an important Assyrian city.

After the fall of Assyria between 612 and 599 BC it was still an integral part of the geo-political province of Assyria – Achaemenid Assyria, Athura, Seleucid Syria, Assyria (Roman province) and Assuristan. In the Parthian and Sassanid eras Kirkuk was capital of the small Assyrian state of Beth Garmai (c.160 BC–250 AD).

The city briefly came to be part of the short-lived Median Empire before falling to the Achaemenid Empire (546–332 BC) where it was incorporated into the province of Athura (Achaemenid Assyria).

Later it became part of the Macedonian Empire (332–312 BC) and succeeding Seleucid Empire (311–150 BC) before falling to the Parthian Empire (150 BC–224 AD) as a part of Athura. The Parthians seemed to only exercise loose control, and a number of small Neo-Assyrian kingdoms sprang up in the region between the 2nd century BC and 4th century AD, one such kingdom named &quot;ܒܝܬܓܪܡܝ&quot;, (that is Bit Garmai in Syriac) had Arrapha as its capital. Christianity also arose during this period, with Arrapha and its surrounds being influenced by the Assyrian Church of the East. The Sassanid Empire destroyed these kingdoms during 3rd and early 4th centuries AD, and Arrapha was incorporated into Sassanid ruled Assuristan (Sassanid Assyria).

In AD 341, the Zoroastrian Shapur II ordered the massacre of all Assyrian Christians in the Persian Sassanid Empire. During the persecution, about 1,150 were martyred in Arrapha.

===Islamic Conquests of Mesopotamia===
Arab Muslims fought the Sassanid empire in the 7th century AD, conquering the region. The city was a part of the Islamic Caliphate until the tenth century. Kirkuk and the surrounding areas were then ruled by the Hasanwayhid Kurds &amp; Annazid Kurds from 1014 to 1120 AD, then it was taken over by Seljuk Turks for many years. After the divided empire collapsed, the city came under the Abbasids rule once again Suleiman Shah who was the governor of the city until it was taken over by Mongols in 1258. After the Mongol invasion, the Ilkhanate was founded in the region and the city became a part of it. The Ilkhanid rule ended when in 1336, the Ardalan took over the city, despite being vassals themselves of the various in Persia centred succeeding Turkic federations in the region, namely that of the Qara Qoyunlu, and the Aq Qoyunlu specifically. After the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514 the city came under the Soran Emirate control until it was taken over by Babanids in 1694. In 1851 it became under direct control of the Ottoman Empire. Ottoman rule continued until World War I when the Ottomans were pushed out of the region by the British Empire.

===British occupation===
At the end of World War I, the British occupied Kirkuk on 7 May 1918. Abandoning the city after about two weeks, the British returned to Kirkuk a few months later after the Armistice of Mudros. Kirkuk avoided the troubles caused by the Kurdish nationalist Mahmud Barzanji, who quickly attempted to overthrow the British Mandate in Iraq and establish his own fiefdom in Sulaymaniyah.

===Entry into the Kingdom of Iraq===
As both Turkey and Great Britain desperately wanted control of the Vilayet of Mosul (of which Kirkuk was a part), the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 failed to solve the issue. For this reason, the question of Mosul was sent to the League of Nations. A committee travelled to the area before coming to a final decision: the territory south of the &quot;Brussels line&quot; belonged to Iraq. By the Treaty of Angora of 1926, Kirkuk became a part of the Kingdom of Iraq.

===Kurdish autonomy and Arabization===

In 1970 the Iraqi government reached an agreement with Kurdish leader Mustafa Barzani called the March Agreement of 1970, but the question of whether the oil-rich province of Kirkuk would be included within the Kurdish autonomous region remained unresolved, pending a new census.

Despite the signing of the March Agreement, relations between the Kurds and Iraqi government continued to deteriorate due to the unresolved status of Kirkuk, and there were two attempts to assassinate Barzani in 1972. In response to Barzani&#x27;s continued demands during the early 1970s for Kirkuk to be recognized as part of the autonomous region under the terms of the March Agreement, settlement construction for newly arrived Arab families increased drastically as the Ba&#x27;athist government implemented Arabization policies to increase the Arab population of Kirkuk. Kurds were forbidden from buying property in Kirkuk, and could sell their properties only to Arabs. They were denied permission to renovate properties in need of maintenance, and poor Shi&#x27;a Arab families were paid to move to Kirkuk, while Kurds were paid to move out.

Negotiations between Barzani&#x27;s Kurdish Democratic Party and the Iraqi government collapsed in March 1974 and Barzani rejected President Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr declaration of Kurdish autonomy. Many disputes persisted between the Kurds and Arabs and the conflict escalated into the Second Iraqi–Kurdish War (also called the Barzani rebellion). The rebellion collapsed after Iran withdrew its support for Barzani&#x27;s forces following the 1975 Algiers Agreement and the Ba&#x27;ath regime intensified Arabization efforts.

After Barzani&#x27;s rebellion was defeated in 1974, the districts of Chemchemal and Kelar, which had been part of Kirkuk, became part of Sulaymaniyah and Kifri became part of Diyala province. Other Arab-populated districts, like Zab, became part of Kirkuk. Kurds, Turkmen and Christian populations were forcibly relocated and replaced with Shi&#x27;a from Iraq&#x27;s south. The expulsions continued after the 1991 uprisings. Kurdish villages were razed and thousands of new homes were built, including at least 200 homes for relatives of Iraqi soldiers killed during the Iran-Iraq War. Between 1968, when the Ba&#x27;ath Party first rose to power in Iraq, and 2003 between 200,000 and 300,000 persons were forcibly relocated out of Kirkuk. According to the Iraqi Ministry of Planning, by August 2005 (during the Iraq War), approximately 224,544 Kurds had returned to Kirkuk and 52,973 Arab persons had left the city.

===Gulf War===
In 1991, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and was quickly routed by the United States in the First Gulf War (also called &quot;Operation Desert Storm&quot;). In the aftermath of the Iraqi army&#x27;s defeat, rebellions broke out in Iraq; first in southern Iraq on March 1, and in the northern Kurdish region a few days later. By March 24, Kurdish &quot;Peshmerga&quot; forces had seized control of Kirkuk, but they were only able to hold it until March 28 when it was reclaimed by Hussein&#x27;s forces. The US and UK began to enforce a no-fly zone in Northern Iraq and a &quot;de facto&quot; Kurdish Autonomous region emerged in the North. Arabs families were expelled from the Kurdish region and relocated to Kirkuk, which was still controlled by the Iraqi government. In these circumstances, Hussein&#x27;s government further intensified the decades long policy of Arabization in Kirkuk, requiring that Kurds, Turkmen and Assyrians fill out &quot;ethnic identity correction&quot; forms and register as Arabs and many who refused to comply were forcibly relocated north of the Green Line. In May 1991, Massoud Barzani announced that Baghdad had conceded Kirkuk as the capital of the autonomous region, but when the Iraqi government demanded the Kurds join the Ba&#x27;athist government the dispute once again escalated to violent conflict and in October 1991 Iraqi forces had withdrawn from several Kurdish provinces in the North including Erbil, Dohuk and Sulaymaniyah.

=== Iraq War (2003–2011) and return of displaced Kurds ===
American and British military forces led an invasion of Iraq in March 2003, marking the start of the Second Iraq War. Kurdish &quot;peshmerga&quot; fighters assisted in the 2003 capture of Kirkuk. Though the &quot;peshmerga&quot; were allowed to operate even after the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) disbanded and outlawed most of the armed militias in Iraq, the &quot;peshmerga&quot; were eventually asked to withdraw from Kirkuk and other Kurdish held provinces.

Under the supervision of chief executive of Coalition Provisional Authority L. Paul Bremer, a convention was held on 24 May 2003 to select the first City Council in the history of this oil-rich, ethnically divided city. Each of the city&#x27;s four major ethnic groups was invited to send a 39-member delegation from which they would be allowed to select six to sit on the City Council. Another six council members were selected from among 144 delegates to represent independents social groups such as teachers, lawyers, religious leaders and artists.

Kirkuk&#x27;s 30 members council is made up of five blocs of six members each. Four of those blocs are formed along ethnic lines—Kurds, Arabs, Assyrian and Turkmen—and the fifth is made up of independents which meant 10 more council seats given to two main Kurdish Parties by Paul Bremer as token of appreciation for cooperation with American Forces. Turkmen and Arabs complained that the Kurds allegedly hold five of the seats in the independent block. They were also infuriated that their only representative at the council&#x27;s helm was an assistant mayor whom they considered pro-Kurdish. Abdul Rahman Mustafa (), a Baghdad-educated lawyer was elected mayor by 20 votes to 10. The appointment of an Arab, Ismail Ahmed Rajab Al Hadidi (), as deputy mayor went some way towards addressing Arab concerns.

On 30 June 2005, through a secret direct voting process, with the participation of the widest communities in the province and despite all the political legal security complexities of this process in the country generally and in Kirkuk in particular, Kirkuk witnessed the birth of its first elected Provincial Council. The Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq IECI approved the elections and announced the outcome of this process, which filled the 41 seats of Kirkuk Provincial Council as follows:

* 26 seats 367 List Kirkuk Brotherhood List KBL
* 8 seats 175 List Iraqi Turkmen Front ITF
* 5 seats 299 List Iraqi Republic Gathering
* 1 seats 178 List Turkmen Islamic Coalition
* 1 seats 289 List Iraqi National Gathering

The new Kirkuk Provincial Council started its second turn on 6 March 2005. Its inaugural session was dedicated to the introduction of its new members, followed by an oath ceremony supervised by Judge Thahir Hamza Salman, the Head of Kirkuk Appellate Court.

Kirkuk is located in a disputed area of Iraq that runs from Sinjar on the Syrian border southeast to Khanaqin and Mandali on the Iranian border. Kirkuk has been a disputed territory for around eighty years — Kurds wanted Kirkuk to become part of the Kurdistan Region, which has been opposed by the region&#x27;s Arab and Turkmen populations.

The Kurds sought to annex the long disputed territory to the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) through Article 140 of the Iraqi Constitution that was enacted in 2005. Under Article 140 the Ba&#x27;athist Arabization policy would be reversed: Displaced Kurds who had relocated to areas in the Kurdish autonomous region would return to Kirkuk, while the Arab Shi&#x27;a population would be compensated and relocated to areas in the south. After the Ba&#x27;athist regimes demographic and redistricting policies were undone a census and referendum would determine whether Kirkuk would be administered by the KRG or Baghdad.

Following the 2010 parliamentary election the Kurds signed the Erbil Agreement and backed Nouri al-Maliki on the condition that Article 140 would be implemented.

===Violence after U.S. withdrawal===
Three churches in Kirkuk were targeted with bombs in August 2011. On 12 July 2013, Kirkuk was hit by a deadly bomb, killing 38 people in an attack on a café. A few days prior, on 11 July 2013, over 40 people were killed in a series of bombings and shootings across Iraq, including in Kirkuk.

===Kurdish control (2014–2017)===
On 12 June 2014, following the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive of the Islamic State, during which it secured control of Tikrit and nearby areas in Syria, the Iraqi army retreated from their positions in Kirkuk and the Peshmerga of the Kurdistan Regional Government then took the city.

On 21 October 2016, the Islamic State launched multiple attacks in Kirkuk to divert Iraqi military resources during the Battle of Mosul. Witnesses reported multiple explosions and gun battles in the city, most centered on a government compound. At least 11 workers, including several Iranians, were killed by a suicide bomber at a power plant in nearby Dibis. The attack was brought to an end by 24 October, with 74 militants being killed and others (including the leader) being arrested.

====Kurdification====
Under Kurdish control, Turkmen and Arab residents in Kirkuk experienced intimidation, harassment and were forced to leave their homes, in order to increase the Kurdish demographic in Kirkuk and bolster their claims to the city. Multiple Human Rights Watch reports detail the confiscation of Turkmen and Arab families&#x27; documents, preventing them from voting, buying property and travelling. Turkmen residents of Kirkuk were detained by Kurdish forces and compelled to leave the city. Kurdish authorities expelled hundreds of Arab families from the city, demolishing their homes in the process.

United Nations reports since 2006 have documented that Kurdish authorities and Peshmerga militia forces were illegally policing Kirkuk and other disputed areas, and that these militia have abducted Turkmen and Arabs, subjecting them to torture.

===Iraqi central government control (2017–present)===
On 16 October 2017, the Iraqi national army and PMF militia retook control of Kirkuk as the Peshmerga forces fled the city without fighting.

Kirkuk has been a disputed territory for around eighty years. The KRG wanted Kirkuk to become part of the Kurdistan Region, which is opposed by the region&#x27;s Arab and Turkmen populations.

There has been a long planned referendum to resolve Kirkuk&#x27;s status under Article 140 of the Iraqi Constitution.

Anti-Kurdish unrest started in Kirkuk after the building used by the Joint Operation Command in Iraq was transferred to the KDP.

==Demographics==
Şemseddin Sâmi mentioned Kirkuk city in the Kâmûsü&#x27;l-A&#x27;lâm written in the late 19th century. And says &quot;Kirkuk is located to the southeast of the Mosul vilayet in Kurdistan, with a population of 30,000.&quot; then he says &quot;The Kurds make up three-quarters of the people of Kirkuk, and the rest are Turks, Arabs, 760 Jews and 460 Chaldeans.&quot;

Kirkuk&#x27;s population was predominantly Turkmen in the early 20th century, when Turkish was the most common language spoken at home. The city had a population near 30,000 in the late 1910s. The Turkmen were majority in the city centre, dominating the political and economic life of the area.

The most reliable census concerning the ethnic composition of Kirkuk dates back to 1957. The Turkish-speaking Turkmen formed the majority in the city of Kirkuk, whilst the Kurds were the plurality in the governorate. The provincial borders were later altered, the province was renamed al-Ta&#x27;mim, and some Kurdish-majority districts were added to Erbil and Sulamaniya provinces.

A report by the International Crisis Group points out that figures from the 1977 and 1997 censuses &quot;are all considered highly problematic, due to suspicions of regime manipulation&quot; because Iraqi citizens were only allowed to indicate belonging to either the Arab or Kurdish ethnic groups; consequently, this skewed the number of other ethnic minorities. Many Iraqi Turkmen declared themselves as Arabs (because the Kurds were not desirable under Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime), reflecting the changes wrought by Arabisation.

===Ethnic groups===
After attacks by ISIS, Kurdish authorities who were suspicious of the Arab refugees in Kirkuk, expelled hundreds of Arab families who had fled to the region during Iraq&#x27;s war against ISIS. The refugees were sent to camps for the displaced or to their places of origin. Some of the displaced described themselves as locals and not as internally displaced.

==== Arabs ====
The principal Arab extended families in the city of Kirkuk were: the Tikriti and the Hadidi (). The Tikriti family was the main Arab family in Kirkuk coming from Tikrit in the 17th century. Other Arab tribes who settled in Kirkuk during the Ottoman Period are the Al-Ubaid () and the Al-Jiburi (). The Al-Ubaid came from just northwest of Mosul when they were forced out of the area by other Arab tribes of that region. They settled in the Hawija district in Kirkuk in 1805 during the Ottoman Period.

==== Armenians ====
In 2017, around 30 Armenian families resided in the city. The community has also an Armenian Apostolic church.

====Assyrians====
The Seleucid town, like many other Upper Mesopotamian cities had a significant indigenous Assyrian population. Christianity was established among them in the 2nd century by the bishop Tuqrītā (Theocritos). During the Sasanian times the town became an important centre of the Assyrian Church of the East, with several of its bishops rising to the rank of Patriarch. Tensions among Christians and Zoroastrians led to a severe persecution of Christians during the reign of Shapur II (309–379 A.D.) as recorded in the Acts of the Persian Martyrs. Persecution resumed under Yazdegerd II in 445 A.D. who massacred thousands of them. Their situation greatly improved under the Sasanians in the following two centuries after the advent of a national Persian church of free of Byzantine influence, namely Nestorianism. Persecution resumed under Yazdegerd II in 445 A.D. who massacred thousands of them. Tradition puts the death toll at 12,000 among them the patriarch Shemon Bar Sabbae. The city was known as the centre of the prosperous Ecclesiastical Province of Beth Garmai which lingered until the conquests of Timur Leng in 1400 A.D. During the Ottoman period most of Kirkuk&#x27;s Christians followed the Chaldean Catholic Church whose bishop resided in the Cathedral of the Great Martyrion which dates back to the 5th century. The cathedral was however used as a powder storage and was blown up as the Ottomans retreated in 1918.

The discovery of oil brought more Christians to Kirkuk, however they were also affected by the Arabization policy of the Baath Party. Their numbers continued to plummet after the American invasion, and they occupy 4% of municipal offices, a percentage thought to be representative of their numbers in the city.

They are ethnic Assyrians who speak their own dialect of Turkish and religiously follow the Chaldean Catholic Church from Kirkuk who lived in or near the citadel, where they adopted the Turkish language from Iraqi Turkmen, especially during the Ottoman Empire. Their dialect is mutually intelligible with the Iraqi Turkmen dialect. Their official hymns, eulogies, and prayers are in Turkish. Their bible is in the Ottoman Turkish language written in the 1800s and is recited by community leaders. The Citadel Christians are not to be confused with the community of Iraqi Turkmen who follow the Roman Catholic Church, which numbered around 30,000 in 2015 and live all across Turkmeneli, including Kirkuk, while the Citadel Christians were exclusively in Kirkuk before the migrations.

====Jews====
Jews had a long history in Kirkuk. Ottoman records show that in 1560 there were 104 Jewish homes in Kirkuk, and in 1896 there were 760 Jews in the city. After World War I, the Jewish population increased, especially after Kirkuk became a petroleum center; in 1947 there were 2,350 counted in the census. Jews were generally engaged in commerce and handicraft. Social progress was slow, and it was only in the 1940s that some Jewish students acquired secondary academic education. By 1951 almost all of the Jews had left for Israel.

====Kurds====
Kirkuk is claimed by the Kurdistan Regional Government as its capital, but they do not control the city or province, and Kirkuk is not part of the Kurdistan Region. The last reliable census shows that the Kurds constituted less than a third of Kirkuk&#x27;s population.

The Baban family was a Kurdish family that, in the 18th and 19th centuries, dominated the political life of the province of Sharazor, in present-day Iraqi Kurdistan. The first member of the clan to gain control of the province and its capital, Kirkuk, was Sulayman Beg. Enjoying almost full autonomy, the Baban family established Kirkuk as their capital. It was from this time that Kurds in Iraq began to view Kirkuk as their capital. This persisted even after the Babans moved their administration to the new town of Sulaymaniya, named after the dynasty&#x27;s founder, in the late 18th century.

====Turkmens====

Iraqi Turkmens view the city as their capital, with the last reliable census showing the city of Kirkuk had a Turkmen majority.

In the city of Kirkuk, Turkmens reside in the neighborhoods of Tisin, Musalla, Korya, Baghdad Road, Sarıkahya, Şaturlu, Beyler, Piryadi, Almas, Arafa, Bulak, Çukur, İmam Abbas, Cırıt Square, Çay, 1 June and Beşiktaş. They are sparsely dispersed in other neighborhoods. It is also known that Christian Turkmens live in the neighborhoods of Şaturlu, Almas and Arafa in Kirkuk. There are many Turkmen villages around Kirkuk. These villages include Türkalan, Yayçı, Çardaklı, Kızılyar, Kümbetler, Bulova and Beşir.

The riverfront, the historical homes, alleyways, the old cemeteries, and the prevailing musical modes of Kirkuk historically belong to the Turkmen. The old names of most of the villages and districts in Kirkuk, as well as the prevalent trades and occupations, trace back to Turkmen families. 

The Turkmen are believed to be descendants of numerous Turkic migration waves. The earliest arrivals date back to the Umayyads and Abbasid eras, when they arrived as military recruits. Considerable Turcoman settlement continued during the Seljuq era when Toghrul entered Iraq in 1055 with his army composed mostly of Oghuz Turks. Kirkuk remained under the control of the Seljuq Empire for 63 years. However, the largest Turkic migration waves occurred during the four centuries of Ottoman rule (1535–1919) when Turkish migrants from Anatolia were encouraged to settle in the region; indeed, it is largely from this period that modern Turkmens claim association with Anatolia and the modern Turkish state.

In particular, following the conquest of Iraq by the Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent in 1535, Kirkuk came firmly under Ottoman control and was referred to “Gökyurt” (Blue Homeland) in the Ottoman records, &quot;perhaps indicating that Kirkuk was identified as a particularly Turkic town by that time.&quot; Under the Ottomans, Turkish migrations from Anatolia to Kirkuk occurred throughout the centuries; firstly during the initial conquest of 1535, followed by the arrival of Turkish families with the army of sultan Murad IV in 1638, whilst others came later with other notable Ottoman figures. These families occupied the highest socioeconomic strata and held the most important bureaucratic jobs until the end of Ottoman rule. During this period, the Turcoman were the predominant population of Kirkuk city and its close environs but Kurds constituted the majority of the rural population of Kirkuk. Kirkuk had a population near 30,000 in the late 1910s, Turkmens were majority in the city center, dominating the political and economic life of the area.

Currently Iraqi Turkmen politicians hold just over 20 percent of seats on Kirkuk&#x27;s city council, while Turkmen leaders say they make up nearly a third of the city.

== Economy ==

The discovery of vast quantities of oil in the region after World War I provided the impetus for the annexation of the former Ottoman Vilayet of Mosul (of which the Kirkuk region was a part), to the Iraqi Kingdom, established in 1921. Since then and particularly from 1963 onwards, there have been continuous attempts to transform the ethnic make-up of the region. Pipelines from Kirkuk run through Turkey to Ceyhan on the Mediterranean Sea and were one of the two main routes for the export of Iraqi oil under the Oil-for-Food Programme following the Gulf War of 1991. This was in accordance with a United Nations mandate that at least 50% of the oil exports pass through Turkey. There were two parallel lines built in 1977 and 1987. 

In 1927, Iraqi and American drillers working for the foreign-owned and British-led Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC) struck a huge oil gusher at Baba Gurgur (&quot;St. Blaze&quot; or father blaze in Kurdish) near Kirkuk. The IPC began exports from the Kirkuk oil field in 1934. The Company moved its headquarters from Tuz Khormatu to a camp on the outskirts of Kirkuk, which they named Arrapha after the ancient city. Arrapha remains a large neighborhood in Kirkuk to this day. The IPC exercised significant political power in the city and played a central role in Kirkuk&#x27;s urbanization, initiating housing and development projects in collaboration with Iraqi authorities in the 1940s and 1950s.

The presence of the oil industry had an effect on Kirkuk&#x27;s demographics. The exploitation of Kirkuk&#x27;s oil, which began around 1930, attracted both Arabs and Kurds to the city in search of work. Kirkuk, which had been a predominantly Iraqi Turkmen city, gradually lost its uniquely Turkmen character. At the same time, large numbers of Kurds from the mountains were settling in the uninhabited but cultivable rural parts of the district of Kirkuk. The influx of Kurds into Kirkuk continued through the 1960s. According to the 1957 census, Kirkuk city was 37.63% Iraqi Turkmen, 33.26% Kurdish with Arabs constituting 22.53% of its population. Assyrians comprised 1.25% of the population.

In 1972 the Iraqi government, led by then Vice-President Saddam Hussein, nationalized the Iraqi Petroleum Company, after being unable to reach an agreement that would increase oil exports and resolve a longstanding dispute over Law 80 of 1961. The Iraqi government began to sell its oil to Eastern bloc countries and the IPC&#x27;s French partner CFP. After reaching an agreement with the Iraqis in 1973, the IPC members were able to retain some of their interests in southern Iraq through the Basra Petroleum Company but had lost Iraq&#x27;s main oilfields, including the Kirkuk field. Some analysts believe that poor reservoir-management practices during the time of Saddam may have seriously, and even permanently, damaged Kirkuk&#x27;s oil field. One example showed an estimated of excess fuel oil being re injected. Other problems include refinery residue and gas-stripped oil. Fuel oil reinjection has increased oil viscosity at Kirkuk making it more difficult and expensive to get the oil out of the ground. 

Over all, between April 2003 and late December 2004 there were an estimated 123 attacks on energy infrastructures, including the country&#x27;s 7,000 km-long pipeline system. In response to these attacks, which cost Iraq billions of U.S dollars in lost oil-export revenues and repair costs, the United States military set up the Task Force Shield to guard Iraq&#x27;s energy infrastructure and the Kirkuk–Ceyhan Oil Pipeline in particular. In spite of the fact that little damage was done to Iraq&#x27;s oil fields during the war itself, looting and sabotage after the war ended was highly destructive and accounted for perhaps eighty percent of the total damage.

==Main sites==
Ancient architectural monuments of Kirkuk include:

* the Prophet Daniel&#x27;s Tomb
* the Kirkuk Citadel
* Qaysareyah of Kirkuk
* the &quot;Qishla&quot; of Kirkuk

The archaeological sites of Qal&#x27;at Jarmo and Yorgan Tepe are found at the outskirts of the modern city. In 1997, there were reports that the government of Saddam Hussein &quot;demolished Kirkuk&#x27;s historic citadel with its mosques and ancient church&quot;.

The architectural heritage of Kirkuk sustained serious damage during World War I (when some pre-Muslim Assyrian Christian monuments were destroyed) and, more recently, during the Iraq War. Simon Jenkins reported in June 2007 that &quot;eighteen ancient shrines have been lost, ten in Kirkuk and the south in the past month alone&quot;.

== Geography ==

Kirkuk is located north of Baghdad.
=== Climate ===
Kirkuk experiences a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: BSh) with extremely hot and dry summers and mild winters with moderate rainfall. Snow is rare but it fell on 22 February 2004, and from 10 to 11 January 2008.

<doc id="199294" wikidata="Q6902842" url="?curid=199294" title="Monster chess">
<text>Monster chess—or Super King chess—is a chess variant in which the White side has only a king and four pawns to fight against all the pieces of the Black side. All the rules of chess apply, except that White makes two successive moves per turn. The white king can move into check on the first move of the turn and move out of check during the second move. The goal for both sides is to checkmate the opponent&#x27;s king.

Monster chess can also be played with White starting with all eight pawns, or with only two. Alternatively, it can be played with colors reversed.

Queening a white pawn generally allows White to declare a checkmate within the next few moves. Also, with only the two kings on the board, White can easily force a Monster chess checkmate.

== Rules ==
* White must execute two moves in their turn. They can do this by moving a piece twice or two pieces once.
* The white king may move into check and then out of check, provided that White can execute two moves. 
* If a king is in check, it must be placed out of check.
* Otherwise, standard chess rules apply.
* A king is in check if it could be captured on the next turn.
* The White King can capture the Black King by virtue of the above rules.

== Checkmating ==
In Monster Chess, White checkmates Black when, no matter where Black moves, White will always be able to take Black&#x27;s king by making two consecutive moves. For example, suppose White moves his pawn to a square that attacks the black king (where attacks means that if White makes two moves in a row, he will be able to take the black king). Black cannot respond by checking the white king with his queen in an attempt to escape mate. If Black did so, White could then respond by taking Black&#x27;s king on his next move with his pawn before Black can take White&#x27;s king with his queen.

Black needs a lot of material to checkmate the bare white king. In general, two queens suffice, as do queen and two rooks. Black king and queen versus the bare white king can be lost (when the white king can continually check until mate or a fork is achieved), or it can be drawn (if the queen is not on the edge, and her king is next to her and cannot be checked).

<doc id="199296" wikidata="Q1542180" url="?curid=199296" title="Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for quality works in the reggae music genre. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

Originally called the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Recording, the honor was presented to artists for eligible songs or albums. The Jamaican group Black Uhuru received the first award in 1985. Beginning with the 1992 ceremony, the name of the award was changed to Best Reggae Album. Starting in 2002, awards were often presented to the engineers, mixers, and/or producers in addition to the performing artists. According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, eligible works are vocal or instrumental reggae albums &quot;containing at least 51% playing time of newly recorded music&quot;, including roots reggae, dancehall and ska music.

Ziggy Marley holds the record for the most wins in this category, with seven wins as of 2017.

==Recipients==




The albums nominated for ‘Best Reggae Album’ at the 2025 Grammy Awards are:

* &quot;Take It Easy&quot; — Collie Buddz
* &quot;Party With Me&quot; — Vybz Kartel
* &quot;Never Gets Late Here&quot; — Shenseea
* &quot;Bob Marley: One Love – Music Inspired By The Film (Deluxe)&quot; — Various Artists
* &quot;Evolution&quot; — The Wailers

 Each year is linked to the article about the Grammy Awards held that year.

==2010 controversy==

Buju Banton&#x27;s (real name Mark Anthony Myrie) nomination for the 2010 award sparked controversy and protest due to homophobic lyrics within his music. Banton&#x27;s most controversial song, released in 1988, is &quot;Boom, Bye Bye&quot;, which &quot;promote[s] the murder of gay men by shooting or burning&quot;. Following the artist&#x27;s nomination, the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation and the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center placed an advertisement in the &quot;Daily Variety&quot; encouraging Grammy officials to denounce music that &quot;promotes or celebrates violence against any group of people&quot;. The advertisement, which took the form of a letter signed by gay rights and civil rights activists, asserted that honoring Banton was awarding &quot;extraordinary hateful work&quot;. The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences responded by insisting that artists are honored for quality music &quot;regardless of politics&quot;. Banton has been quoted as saying that he sees &quot;no end to the war&quot; between himself and gay men. The 2010 award was presented to Stephen Marley. Banton was nominated in 2011 for the album &quot;Before the Dawn&quot;. Other reggae musicians that have been accused of promoting anti-gay lyrics include Beenie Man, Elephant Man, Shabba Ranks and Sizzla.

<doc id="199297" wikidata="Q1850611" url="?curid=199297" title="List of astronauts by year of selection">
<text>This is a list of [[astronaut]]s by year of selection: people selected to train for a human spaceflight program to command, pilot, or serve as a crew member of a spacecraft. Until recently, astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments, either by the military or by civilian space agencies. However, with the advent of suborbital flight starting with privately funded SpaceShipOne in 2004, a new category of astronaut was created: the commercial astronaut.

While the term astronaut is sometimes applied to anyone who trains for travels into space—including scientists, politicians, journalists, and tourists—this article lists only professional astronauts, those who have been selected to train as a profession. This includes national space programs and private industry programs which train and/or hire their own professional astronauts.

More than 500 people have trained as astronauts. A list of everyone who has flown in space can be found at &quot;List of space travelers by name&quot;.

==X-15 pilot group (USA)==
:Fourteen pilots were directly involved with the X-15, although only twelve actually flew the vehicles. There was no formal selection process, since everyone chosen was already a qualified test pilot.

:Scott Crossfield and Alvin White were the prime and backup North American Aviation test pilots who first became involved with the project. Air Force Captains Iven Kincheloe (prime pilot) and Robert White (backup) were assigned to the X-15 in 1957. When Kincheloe was killed in an accident through a different rocket aircraft program, White became prime pilot and Captain Robert Rushworth became his backup. The first NASA pilots were Joseph Walker and Neil Armstrong. Lieutenant Commander Forrest S. Petersen represented the Navy.

:Walker and Armstrong were eventually replaced by NASA pilots John B. McKay (1960), Milton Thompson (1963) and William H. Dana (1965). White and Rushworth were succeeded by Captain Joe Engle (1963), Captain William Joseph Knight (1964) and Major Michael Adams (1966). The Navy selected Lieutenant Lloyd Hoover (1924–2016) as Peterson&#x27;s replacement, though he never trained or flew.

:The last surviving member of this group was Joe Engle; he died in 2024.

==1958==
June 25 – Man in Space Soonest (USA)

:Neil Armstrong, William B. Bridgeman, Albert S. Crossfield, Iven C. Kincheloe, John B. McKay, Robert A. Rushworth, Joseph A. Walker, Alvin S. White, and Robert M. White.

:Nine test pilots from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), the United States Air Force (USAF), North American Aviation (NAA), and Douglas Aircraft Corporation were selected for the Man in Space Soonest project, a USAF initiative to put a man in space before the Soviet Union did. The project was cancelled on August 1, but two of these men would later reach space: Walker made two X-15 flights above 100 kilometers in 1963; and Neil Armstrong joined NASA in 1962 and flew in Project Gemini and Apollo, becoming the first human to set foot on the Moon at 02:56 UTC July 21, 1969.

:The last surviving member of this group was Neil Armstrong; he died in 2012.

==1959==
April 9 – NASA Group 1 – &quot;Mercury Seven&quot; (USA)

:Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, John Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard and Deke Slayton.

:The first group of astronauts selected by NASA were for Project Mercury in April 1959. All seven were military test pilots, a requirement specified by President Eisenhower to simplify the selection process. All seven eventually flew in space, although one, Deke Slayton, did not fly a Mercury mission due to a medical disqualification, instead flying a decade later on the Apollo–Soyuz mission. The other six each flew one Mercury mission. For two of these, Scott Carpenter and John Glenn, the Mercury mission was their only flight in the Mercury/Gemini/Apollo era. Glenn later flew on the Space Shuttle.

:Three of the Mercury astronauts, Gus Grissom, Gordon Cooper and Wally Schirra, also each flew a mission during the Gemini program. Alan Shepard was slated to fly Mercury 10 before its cancellation and was the original commander for the Gemini 3 mission, but did not fly due to a medical disqualification. After surgery to correct the problem, he later flew as commander of Apollo 14. He was the only Mercury astronaut to go to the Moon.

:Wally Schirra was the only astronaut to fly into space on all three types of spacecraft, though Gus Grissom was scheduled to be first to complete that feat before he died in a fire on Apollo 1 during launchpad training. Gordon Cooper was a backup commander for Apollo 10, the &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; flight for the lunar landing, and would have commanded another mission—likely to have been Apollo 13, according to the crew rotation—but was bumped from the rotation after a disagreement with NASA management.

:Collectively, at least one member of the Mercury Seven flew on every NASA class of human-rated spacecraft (but neither the Skylab nor ISS space stations) through the end of the 20th century: Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and the Space Shuttle.

:The last surviving member of this group was John Glenn; he died in 2016.

==1960==

:As of 2024, the only surviving member is Boris Volynov.

April – Dyna–Soar Group 1 (USA)

:Neil Armstrong, William H. Dana, Henry C. Gordon, Pete Knight, Russell L. Rogers, Milt Thompson, and James W. Wood.

:In April 1960, seven men were secretly chosen for the Dyna-Soar program. Armstrong had previously been part of the MISS program. Armstrong and Dana left the program in the summer of 1962.

:The last surviving member of this group was William H. Dana; he died in 2014.

==1962==
March 12 – Female Group (USSR)

:ru:Женская группа космонавтов ВВС (1962)

:Tatyana Kuznetsova, Valentina Ponomaryova, Irina Solovyova, Valentina Tereshkova, and Zhanna Yorkina.

:On March 12, 1962, a group of five civilian women with parachuting experience was added to the cosmonaut training program. Only Tereshkova would fly. A leading Soviet high-altitude parachutist, 20-year-old Tatyana Kuznetsova was, and remains, the youngest person ever selected to train for spaceflight.

September 17 – NASA Group 2 – &quot;The Next Nine, aka&quot; &quot;The Nifty Nine&quot;, &quot;The New Nine&quot; (USA)

:Neil Armstrong, Frank Borman, Pete Conrad, Jim Lovell, Jim McDivitt, Elliot See, Tom Stafford, Ed White, and John Young.

:A second group of nine astronauts was selected by NASA in September 1962. All of this group flew missions in the Gemini program except Elliot See, who died in a flight accident while preparing for the Gemini 9 flight. All of the others also flew on Apollo, except for Ed White, who died in the Apollo 1 launchpad fire.

:Three of this group, McDivitt, Borman and Armstrong, made single flights in both Gemini and Apollo. Four others, Young, Lovell, Stafford and Conrad, each made two flights in Gemini and at least one flight in Apollo. Young and Lovell both made two Apollo flights. Conrad and Stafford also made second flights in Apollo spacecraft, Conrad on Skylab 2 and Stafford in Apollo–Soyuz.

:Six of this group, Borman, Lovell, Stafford, Young, Armstrong and Conrad, made flights to the Moon. Lovell and Young went to the Moon twice. Armstrong, Conrad, and Young walked on the Moon. McDivitt was later Apollo Program Director and became the first general officer and would have been either the prime LM Pilot or backup commander for Apollo 14, but left NASA due to a conflict between Alan Shepard and Deke Slayton. John Young also later flew on the Space Shuttle (STS-1 and STS-9) and would retire from NASA in 2004, 42 years after becoming an astronaut. He was both the first and last of his group to go into space.

:As of July 2024, the last surviving member of this group is Jim Lovell.

September 19 – Dyna-Soar Group 2 (USA)

:On September 19, 1962, Albert Crews (born 1929) was added to the Dyna-Soar program and the names of the six active Dyna-Soar astronauts were announced to the public.

June 1 – Journalist Group 1 (USSR)

:In 1965, three civilian journalists, Yaroslav Golovanov, , , were selected for cosmonaut training in preparation for flight on a Voskhod mission. When the Voskhod program was canceled, Golovanov and Letunov were dismissed. Rebrov, on the other hand, stayed with the space program as a journalist until 1974.

:The last surviving member of this group was Yaroslav Golovanov; he died in 2003.

June 1 – Medical Group 2 (USSR)

:Three physicians were selected for the long-duration Voskhod flights: Yevgeni Illyin (born 1937), Aleksandr Kiselyov (born 1934), Yuri Senkevich. All were subsequently canceled to make way for the Soviet Moon program and dismissed at the beginning of the following year.

June 28 – NASA Group 4 – &quot;The Scientists&quot; (USA)

:Owen Garriott, Edward Gibson, Duane Graveline, Joseph Kerwin, Curt Michel, Harrison Schmitt

:Graveline and Michel left NASA without flying in space. Schmitt walked on the Moon with Apollo 17. Garriott, Gibson and Kerwin all flew to Skylab. Garriott also flew on Space Shuttle flight STS-9, becoming the first Amateur radio operator (callsign W5LFL) to operate from orbit.

October 28 – Air Force Group 3 (USSR)

:ru:3-й набор космонавтов ЦПК ВВС (1965)

:This cosmonaut group was selected for participation in five separate Soyuz programmes that the USSR was running. These included military programs—with and without the Almaz/Salyut space stations—and two lunar programs, only one of which aimed at an actual lunar landing. In the end, only the orbital program and the space station program went ahead. Few of the cosmonauts from this group ever were given the chance to fly.

November – USAF MOL Group 1 (USA)

:Michael J. Adams, Albert H. Crews Jr., John L. Finley, Richard E. Lawyer, Lachlan Macleay, Francis G. Neubeck, James M. Taylor, Richard H. Truly.

:This group was selected for training for the US Air Force&#x27;s Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program.

Roughly half of them flew in the Apollo program, while others flew during Skylab and the Space Shuttle, with Brand also flying on the American half of the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project in 1975. Engle was the only NASA astronaut to have earned his astronaut wings before his selection.
:Two of this group never flew into space: Givens was killed in a car accident in 1967, and Bull resigned from the Astronaut Corps in 1968 after discovering he had pulmonary disease. Engle, Lind, and McCandless were the only ones from this group who never flew an Apollo spacecraft; Brand, Haise, Lousma, Mattingly, and Weitz all flew both an Apollo and a Shuttle (though Haise only flew the Approach and Landing Tests in the Shuttle program, not into space).

May 23 – Civilian Specialist Group 2 (USSR)

:Sergei Anokhin, Vladimir Bugrov, Gennadi Dolgopolov, Georgi Grechko, Valeri Kubasov, Oleg Makarov, Vladislav Volkov, Aleksei Yeliseyev

:This group was selected for training for the US Air Force&#x27;s MOL program. Lawrence was the first African-American to be chosen as an astronaut, but was killed in a jet accident before the MOL program was canceled in 1969. Had Lawrence not died, he would have been, if accepted by NASA, the first African-American astronaut candidate, predating Guion Bluford, Ronald McNair and Frederick Gregory by nine years. Peterson transferred to NASA in 1969 after the MOL cancellation and would fly on the Space Shuttle. Herres would later become the first Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under the Goldwater–Nichols Act in 1987.

:As of 2023, the only surviving member is James Abrahamson.

October 4 – NASA Group 6 – &quot;XS-11&quot; &quot;(The Excess Eleven)&quot; (USA)

:This second group of scientist-astronauts were assigned as support crew members for the last three Apollo missions or as backup crew members for Skylab.

:Chapman, Holmquest, Llewellyn, and O&#x27;Leary resigned from NASA before the end of the Apollo program, and the rest of the group members eventually flew as mission specialists during the Space Shuttle program. With his flight on STS-80 at the age of 61, Musgrave held the title of &quot;oldest astronaut&quot; prior to John Glenn&#x27;s second flight. England resigned from NASA in 1972 but rejoined the astronaut corps in 1979.

:Leonid Ivanov, Leonid Kadenyuk, Nikolai Moskalenko, Sergei Protchenko, Yevgeni Saley, Anatoly Solovyev, Vladimir Titov, Vladimir Vasyutin, Alexander Volkov
Protchenko was removed from the squad for health reasons, Ivanov was killed in the crash of a MiG-27 during test pilot training and Kadenyuk was removed from the squad over marital issues (but accepted back into the Cosmonaut Detachment in 1988). Vasyutin concealed a medical condition from doctors that resulted in his falling ill during the Soyuz T-14/ Salyut 7 EO-4 flight causing the premature termination of the mission 4 months early. This resulted in more stringent cosmonaut medical checks which Moskalenko and Saley failed.

November 25 – 1976 Intercosmos Group (USSR)

:Mirosław Hermaszewski (Poland), Zenon Jankowski (Poland), Sigmund Jähn (East Germany), Eberhard Köllner (East Germany), Oldřich Pelčák (Czechoslovakia), Vladimír Remek (Czechoslovakia)

==1978==
January 16 – NASA Group 8 – &quot;TFNG Thirty-Five New Guys&quot; (USA)

:Pilots: Daniel Brandenstein, Michael Coats, Richard Covey, John Creighton, Robert Gibson, Frederick D. Gregory, Frederick Hauck, Jon McBride, Francis &quot;Dick&quot; Scobee, Brewster Shaw, Loren Shriver, David Walker, Donald Williams

:Mission specialists: Guion Bluford, James Buchli, John Fabian, Anna Fisher, Dale Gardner, S. David Griggs, Terry Hart, Steven Hawley, Jeffrey Hoffman, Shannon Lucid, Ronald McNair, Richard Mullane, Steven Nagel, George Nelson, Ellison Onizuka, Judith Resnik, Sally Ride, Rhea Seddon, Robert Stewart, Kathryn D. Sullivan, Norman Thagard, James van Hoften

:Due to the long delay between the last Apollo mission and the first flight of the Space Shuttle in 1981, few astronauts from the older groups stayed with NASA—though some did, including John Young. Thus, in 1978, a new group of 35 astronauts was selected after 9 years without new astronauts, including the first American female astronauts, with one of them, Judith Resnik, also being the first Jewish American astronaut, as well as the first African-American astronauts to fly, Guion Bluford and Frederick D. Gregory (the first black astronaut was Robert Henry Lawrence Jr), and the first Asian-American, Ellison Onizuka. Bob Stewart was the first Army astronaut to be selected (almost 19 years after the original Mercury Seven). Since then, a new group has been selected roughly every two years.

:Two different astronaut groups were formed: pilots and mission specialists. Additionally, the Shuttle Program has payload specialists who are selected for a single mission and are not part of the astronaut corps—mostly scientists, with a few politicians, and many international astronauts.

:Of the first of the post-Apollo group, Sally Ride would become the first American woman in space (STS-7). Later, she would fly with Kathryn Sullivan on a Shuttle flight in which Sullivan would become the first American woman to perform an EVA. Dr. Thagard, who flew with Ride on STS-7, would later become the first American to be launched on a Russian rocket (Soyuz TM-21 or &quot;Mir-18&quot;) to the Mir space station, while Shannon Lucid would serve on Mir for slightly over six months, breaking all American space duration records (both the Skylab 4 record and Thagard&#x27;s) from 1996 to 1997 until Sunita Williams, who was selected 20 years later, broke Lucid&#x27;s record.
:Of this group, Scobee, Resnik, Onizuka, and McNair would perish in the Challenger Disaster. Of the astronauts chosen, Anna Fisher remained on active duty the longest, retiring in 2017 (although her tenure included an extended leave of absence from 1989 to 1996), while Robert Gibson and Rhea Seddon became the first active-duty astronauts to marry (both are now retired). Shannon Lucid&#x27;s tenure was unbroken from 1978 until she announced her retirement in 2012. In later years she served as a space shuttle CAPCOM, up to the final day of the final shuttle mission. After the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, Sally Ride would serve on both the Rogers Commission and the Columbia Accident Investigation Board.

: Mission specialists: James Bagian, Franklin Chang–Diaz, Mary Cleave, Bonnie Dunbar, William Fisher, David Hilmers, David Leestma, John Lounge, Jerry Ross, Sherwood Spring, Robert Springer
:International mission specialists: Claude Nicollier, Wubbo Ockels
: Of this group, Franklin Chang-Diaz would become the first Hispanic-American in space, Michael Smith would perish in the Challenger disaster, and John Blaha would fly aboard the Mir space station. Both Jerry Ross and Chang-Diaz currently jointly hold the record of number of crewed spaceflights flown, at seven. Charles Bolden was chosen in 2009 to become the second NASA astronaut and the first African-American to the post of NASA Administrator on a full-time basis (although Frederick Gregory, who is also African-American and a former Shuttle commander, held the post on a temporary basis between the departure of Sean O&#x27;Keefe and the appointment of Michael Griffin in 2005). The announcement, made a day before the conclusion of the STS-125 flight to the Hubble Space Telescope, was coincidental, because Bolden was the pilot on the telescope&#x27;s deployment flight in 1990.

== Commercial advances ==
The space market exceeds $330 billion today. Current estimates show the number growing to nearly $3 trillion over the next three decades. Human spaceflight is one of the sectors positioned for greatest growth. Commercial astronauts are expected to fill the gap in this transition.

Ansari X Prize

The first commercial astronauts were selected by contenders for the Ansari X PRIZE, the first nongovernmental reusable crewed spacecraft, in 2004. Among them include Starchaser Industries directors Steve Bennett (United Kingdom) and Matt Shewbridge; former NASA astronauts John Bennett Herrington (Pioneer Rocketplane), Richard Searfoss and pilot Dick Rutan (XCOR Aerospace); Canadian engineer Brian Feeney (da Vinci Project); and veteran Wally Funk from Mercury 13 (Interorbital Systems).

=== Boeing ===

Boeing hired former NASA astronaut Chris Ferguson to join the Space Exploration Team. Candidates for Boeing&#x27;s astronaut corps include former NASA astronauts, commercial scientist astronauts and test pilots who have never flown in space.

=== SpaceX ===
SpaceX has employed former NASA astronauts, but did not select any SpaceX employees to fly its commercial vehicles to the International Space Station.

SpaceX&#x27;s former medical director at SpaceX, Anil Menon, is now a NASA astronaut selected in 2021 as a member of NASA Astronaut Group 23. 

SpaceX employees Anna Menon (Lead Space Operations Engineer) and Sarah Gillis (Senior Space Operations Engineer), were selected to participate in the private Polaris Dawn mission as a part of Polaris Program.

=== Association of Spaceflight Professionals ===

The world&#x27;s first commercial astronaut corps, the Association of Spaceflight Professionals received funding for a series of crewed spaceflight missions through the NASA Flight Opportunities Program in March 2012.

Several million dollars have been allocated for detailed spectroscopic analysis of high-altitude noctilucent cloud formations on suborbital flights using rapidly reusable, task-and-deploy spaceplanes.

The organization&#x27;s commercial astronauts go through a selection process modeled after the NASA Astronaut Corps, which involves NASA astronauts. Some of its members serve as astronaut trainers themselves; some have interviewed as finalists in national space agency astronaut candidate selection campaigns. Yi So-yeon, who completed an orbital mission to the International Space Station, is a member of the organization.

=== Virgin Galactic ===

Scaled Composites and Virgin Galactic astronauts include Michael Alsbury (killed in the 2014 Virgin Galactic crash), Rob Bendall (Canada), Richard Branson, Peter Kalogiannis, Niki Lauda (Austria), Brian Maisler, Clint Nichols, Wes Persall, Burt Rutan, Peter Seiffert, Peter Siebold, Mark Stucky, and Dave Mackay.

=== Teachers in Space ===

The Teachers in Space program began in 2005. In 2012, the United States Rocket Academy announced that the program was expanding to include a broader range of participants, renaming the initiative Citizens in Space. For its first phase, Citizens in Space selected and trained ten citizen astronaut candidates to fly as payload operators, including four astronaut candidates already in training (Maureen Adams, Steve Heck, Michael Johnson, and Edward Wright). Informal educator and aerospace historian Gregory Kennedy was among those listed.

=== Copenhagen Suborbitals ===

Copenhagen Suborbitals (2008, Denmark) seeks to make Denmark the fourth nation to launch humans above the Kármán line.

=== Mars One ===

Mars One was a private initiative with claims to establish a permanent human colony on Mars by 2023. The project was led by Dutch entrepreneur Bas Lansdorp, who announced plans for the Mars One mission in May 2012.

A Mars One astronaut selection announcement was made on April 19, 2013, and started its search on April 22, 2013. By August 2013, Mars One had more than 200,000 applicants from around the world. Round Two selection results were declared on December 30, 2013, wherein a total of 1058 applicants from 107 countries were selected.

Mars One received a variety of criticism relating to medical, technical and financial feasibility. Unverified rumors claimed that Mars One was a scam designed to take as much money as possible from donors, including those participating as contestants.

In February 2019, it was reported that Mars One had declared bankruptcy in a Swiss court on January 15, 2019, and was permanently dissolved as a company.

=== Inspiration Mars ===

Inspiration Mars Foundation, an American nonprofit founded by Dennis Tito, aimed to launch a human mission to flyby Mars in January 2018, or, as the 2018 date was missed, in 2021. Flight candidates included husband and wife travel duo Jane Poynter and Taber MacCallum, who participated in the Biosphere 2 experiment.

=== Waypoint2Space ===

Waypoint2Space was granted FAA safety approval for its training services in 2014. The company works in collaboration with NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston to provide spaceflight training.

=== Truax Engineering ===

The first private firm that tried to build a suborbital space rocket, Truax Engineering, selected company employee, engineer and lifelong aviator Jeana Yeager as the first test pilot for its rocket. The project was halted in 1991 due to lack of funds.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Rap Album is an award presented to recording artists for quality albums with rapping at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

In 1995, the Academy announced the addition of the award category Best Rap Album. The first award was presented to the group Naughty by Nature at the 38th Grammy Awards the following year. According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, the award is presented for &quot;albums containing at least 51% playing time of tracks with newly recorded rapped performances&quot;. Award recipients often include the producers, engineers, and/or mixers associated with the nominated work in addition to the recording artists.

As of 2023, Eminem holds the record for the most wins in this category, with six. Lauryn Hill was the first female artist to win in this category, when she won in 1997 with the Fugees. The duo Outkast and rapper Tyler, The Creator have both received the award twice. Jay-Z holds the record for the most nominations, with eleven. Drake became the first non-American winner in this category when he won in 2013. The Roots have received the most nominations without a win, with five. Eminem and West are the only artists to win the award in consecutive years, with Eminem achieving the feat twice. In 2016, Drake&#x27;s &quot;If You&#x27;re Reading This It&#x27;s Too Late&quot; became the first mixtape to get nominated for the award, and in 2017, Chance the Rapper&#x27;s &quot;Coloring Book&quot; became the first mixtape to win the award. Cardi B became the first solo female rapper to win for &quot;Invasion of Privacy&quot;.

<doc id="199302" wikidata="Q4994728" url="?curid=199302" title="Grammy Award for Best Country Album">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Country Album is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for quality albums in the country music genre. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

The award was first presented under the name of Best Country &amp; Western Album in 1966 to Roger Miller for &quot;Dang Me/Chug-A-Lug&quot; and was discontinued the following year. In 1995 the category was revived and received its current denomination of Best Country Album. According to the category description guide for the 66th Grammy Awards (2024), the award is presented to vocal or instrumental country albums containing at least 51% playing time of new recordings, and the Grammy is awarded to the artist and producer, and to the engineer/mixer of greater than 50% playing time of the album. (The list of nominees only mentions Artists).

The Dixie Chicks are the most awarded performers in this category with four wins, followed by Taylor Swift and Chris Stapletonwho has three wins. Two-time award winners include Roger Miller, Lady A, Kacey Musgraves and Miranda Lambert. Canadian singer Shania Twain is the only non-American winner in this category, to date. Trisha Yearwood holds the record for most nominations, with eight. Yearwood also holds the record for most nominations without a win. The current holder of the award is Beyonce, the first black artist, who won at the 67th Grammy Awards with her eighth studio album &quot;Cowboy Carter&quot;.

<text>In classical electromagnetism, Ampère&#x27;s circuital law (not to be confused with Ampère&#x27;s force law) relates the circulation of a magnetic field around a closed loop to the electric current passing through the loop. 

James Clerk Maxwell derived it using hydrodynamics in his 1861 published paper &quot;On Physical Lines of Force&quot;. In 1865 he generalized the equation to apply to time-varying currents by adding the displacement current term, resulting in the modern form of the law, sometimes called the Ampère–Maxwell law, which is one of Maxwell&#x27;s equations that form the basis of classical electromagnetism.

== Ampère&#x27;s original circuital law ==
In 1820 Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted discovered that an electric current creates a magnetic field around it, when he noticed that the needle of a compass next to a wire carrying current turned so that the needle was perpendicular to the wire. He investigated and discovered the rules which govern the field around a straight current-carrying wire:
* The magnetic field lines encircle the current-carrying wire.
* The magnetic field lines lie in a plane perpendicular to the wire.
* If the direction of the current is reversed, the direction of the magnetic field reverses.
* The strength of the field is directly proportional to the magnitude of the current.
* The strength of the field at any point is inversely proportional to the distance of the point from the wire.

This sparked a great deal of research into the relation between electricity and magnetism. André-Marie Ampère investigated the magnetic force between two current-carrying wires, discovering Ampère&#x27;s force law. In the 1850s Scottish mathematical physicist James Clerk Maxwell generalized these results and others into a single mathematical law. The original form of Maxwell&#x27;s circuital law, which he derived as early as 1855 in his paper &quot;On Faraday&#x27;s Lines of Force&quot; based on an analogy to hydrodynamics, relates magnetic fields to electric currents that produce them. It determines the magnetic field associated with a given current, or the current associated with a given magnetic field.

The original circuital law only applies to a magnetostatic situation, to continuous steady currents flowing in a closed circuit. For systems with electric fields that change over time, the original law (as given in this section) must be modified to include a term known as Maxwell&#x27;s correction (see below).

=== Equivalent forms ===
The original circuital law can be written in several different forms, which are all ultimately equivalent:
* An &quot;integral form&quot; and a &quot;differential form&quot;. The forms are exactly equivalent, and related by the Kelvin–Stokes theorem (see the &quot;proof&quot; section below).
* Forms using SI units, and those using cgs units. Other units are possible, but rare. This section will use SI units, with cgs units discussed later.
* Forms using either or magnetic fields. These two forms use the total current density and free current density, respectively. The and fields are related by the constitutive equation: in non-magnetic materials where is the magnetic constant.

=== Explanation ===
The integral form of the original circuital law is a line integral of the magnetic field around some closed curve (arbitrary but must be closed). The curve in turn bounds both a surface which the electric current passes through (again arbitrary but not closed—since no three-dimensional volume is enclosed by ), and encloses the current. The mathematical statement of the law is a relation between the circulation of the magnetic field around some path (line integral) due to the current which passes through that enclosed path (surface integral).

In terms of total current, (which is the sum of both free current and bound current) the line integral of the magnetic -field (in teslas, T) around closed curve is proportional to the total current passing through a surface (enclosed by ). In terms of free current, the line integral of the magnetic -field (in amperes per metre, A·m−1) around closed curve equals the free current through a surface .
* is the total current density (in amperes per square metre, A·m−2),
* is the free current density only,
* is the closed line integral around the closed curve ,
* denotes a surface integral over the surface bounded by the curve ,
* is the vector dot product,
* is an infinitesimal element (a differential) of the curve (i.e. a vector with magnitude equal to the length of the infinitesimal line element, and direction given by the tangent to the curve )
* is the vector area of an infinitesimal element of surface (that is, a vector with magnitude equal to the area of the infinitesimal surface element, and direction normal to surface . The direction of the normal must correspond with the orientation of by the right hand rule), see below for further explanation of the curve and surface .
* is the curl operator.

=== Ambiguities and sign conventions ===
There are a number of ambiguities in the above definitions that require clarification and a choice of convention.
# First, three of these terms are associated with sign ambiguities: the line integral could go around the loop in either direction (clockwise or counterclockwise); the vector area could point in either of the two directions normal to the surface; and is the net current passing through the surface , meaning the current passing through in one direction, minus the current in the other direction—but either direction could be chosen as positive. These ambiguities are resolved by the right-hand rule: With the palm of the right-hand toward the area of integration, and the index-finger pointing along the direction of line-integration, the outstretched thumb points in the direction that must be chosen for the vector area . Also the current passing in the same direction as must be counted as positive. The right hand grip rule can also be used to determine the signs.
#Second, there are infinitely many possible surfaces that have the curve as their border. (Imagine a soap film on a wire loop, which can be deformed by blowing on the film). Which of those surfaces is to be chosen? If the loop does not lie in a single plane, for example, there is no one obvious choice. The answer is that it does not matter: in the magnetostatic case, the current density is solenoidal (see next section), so the divergence theorem and continuity equation imply that the flux through any surface with boundary , with the same sign convention, is the same. In practice, one usually chooses the most convenient surface (with the given boundary) to integrate over.

== Free current versus bound current ==

The electric current that arises in the simplest textbook situations would be classified as &quot;free current&quot;—for example, the current that passes through a wire or battery. In contrast, &quot;bound current&quot; arises in the context of bulk materials that can be magnetized and/or polarized. (All materials can to some extent.)

When a material is magnetized (for example, by placing it in an external magnetic field), the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms, but behave as if they were orbiting the nucleus in a particular direction, creating a microscopic current. When the currents from all these atoms are put together, they create the same effect as a macroscopic current, circulating perpetually around the magnetized object. This magnetization current is one contribution to &quot;bound current&quot;.

The other source of bound current is bound charge. When an electric field is applied, the positive and negative bound charges can separate over atomic distances in polarizable materials, and when the bound charges move, the polarization changes, creating another contribution to the &quot;bound current&quot;, the polarization current .

The total current density due to free and bound charges is then:

:formula_1

with   the &quot;free&quot; or &quot;conduction&quot; current density.

All current is fundamentally the same, microscopically. Nevertheless, there are often practical reasons for wanting to treat bound current differently from free current. For example, the bound current usually originates over atomic dimensions, and one may wish to take advantage of a simpler theory intended for larger dimensions. The result is that the more microscopic Ampère&#x27;s circuital law, expressed in terms of and the microscopic current (which includes free, magnetization and polarization currents), is sometimes put into the equivalent form below in terms of and the free current only. For a detailed definition of free current and bound current, and the proof that the two formulations are equivalent, see the &quot;proof&quot; section below.

== Shortcomings of the original formulation of the circuital law ==

There are two important issues regarding the circuital law that require closer scrutiny. First, there is an issue regarding the continuity equation for electrical charge. In vector calculus, the identity for the divergence of a curl states that the divergence of the curl of a vector field must always be zero. Hence
: formula_2
and so the original Ampère&#x27;s circuital law implies that
: formula_3
i.e. that the current density is solenoidal.

But in general, reality follows the continuity equation for electric charge:
: formula_4
which is nonzero for a time-varying charge density. An example occurs in a capacitor circuit where time-varying charge densities exist on the plates.

Second, there is an issue regarding the propagation of electromagnetic waves. For example, in free space, where
: formula_5
the circuital law implies that
: formula_6
i.e. that the magnetic field is irrotational, but to maintain consistency with the continuity equation for electric charge, we must have
: formula_7

To treat these situations, the contribution of displacement current must be added to the current term in the circuital law.

James Clerk Maxwell conceived of displacement current as a polarization current in the dielectric vortex sea, which he used to model the magnetic field hydrodynamically and mechanically. He added this displacement current to Ampère&#x27;s circuital law at equation 112 in his 1861 paper &quot;On Physical Lines of Force&quot;.

=== Displacement current ===
In free space, the displacement current is related to the time rate of change of electric field.

In a dielectric the above contribution to displacement current is present too, but a major contribution to the displacement current is related to the polarization of the individual molecules of the dielectric material. Even though charges cannot flow freely in a dielectric, the charges in molecules can move a little under the influence of an electric field. The positive and negative charges in molecules separate under the applied field, causing an increase in the state of polarization, expressed as the polarization density . A changing state of polarization is equivalent to a current.

Both contributions to the displacement current are combined by defining the displacement current as:
: formula_8
where the electric displacement field is defined as:
: formula_9
where is the electric constant, the relative static permittivity, and is the polarization density. Substituting this form for in the expression for displacement current, it has two components:
: formula_10

The first term on the right hand side is present everywhere, even in a vacuum. It doesn&#x27;t involve any actual movement of charge, but it nevertheless has an associated magnetic field, as if it were an actual current. Some authors apply the name &quot;displacement current&quot; to only this contribution.

The second term on the right hand side is the displacement current as originally conceived by Maxwell, associated with the polarization of the individual molecules of the dielectric material.

Maxwell&#x27;s original explanation for displacement current focused upon the situation that occurs in dielectric media. In the modern post-aether era, the concept has been extended to apply to situations with no material media present, for example, to the vacuum between the plates of a charging vacuum capacitor. The displacement current is justified today because it serves several requirements of an electromagnetic theory: correct prediction of magnetic fields in regions where no free current flows; prediction of wave propagation of electromagnetic fields; and conservation of electric charge in cases where charge density is time-varying. For greater discussion see Displacement current.

== Extending the original law: the Ampère–Maxwell equation ==

Next, the circuital equation is extended by including the polarization current, thereby remedying the limited applicability of the original circuital law.

Treating free charges separately from bound charges, the equation including Maxwell&#x27;s correction in terms of the -field is (the -field is used because it includes the magnetization currents, so does not appear explicitly, see -field and also Note):
: formula_11
(integral form), where is the magnetic field (also called &quot;auxiliary magnetic field&quot;, &quot;magnetic field intensity&quot;, or just &quot;magnetic field&quot;), is the electric displacement field, and is the enclosed conduction current or free current density. In differential form,
: formula_12

On the other hand, treating all charges on the same footing (disregarding whether they are bound or free charges), the generalized Ampère&#x27;s equation, also called the Maxwell–Ampère equation, is in integral form (see the &quot;proof&quot; section below):
{\partial t}\right) \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}

In differential form,
{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

In both forms includes magnetization current density as well as conduction and polarization current densities. That is, the current density on the right side of the Ampère–Maxwell equation is:
: formula_13
where current density is the &quot;displacement current&quot;, and is the current density contribution actually due to movement of charges, both free and bound. Because , the charge continuity issue with Ampère&#x27;s original formulation is no longer a problem. Because of the term in , wave propagation in free space now is possible.

With the addition of the displacement current, Maxwell was able to hypothesize (correctly) that light was a form of electromagnetic wave. See electromagnetic wave equation for a discussion of this important discovery.

=== Proof of equivalence ===
Proof that the formulations of the circuital law in terms of free current are equivalent to the formulations involving total current

In this proof, we will show that the equation
: formula_14
is equivalent to the equation
: formula_15
Note that we are only dealing with the differential forms, not the integral forms, but that is sufficient since the differential and integral forms are equivalent in each case, by the Kelvin–Stokes theorem.

We introduce the polarization density , which has the following relation to and :
: formula_16

Next, we introduce the magnetization density , which has the following relation to and :
: formula_17
and the following relation to the bound current:
: formula_18
where
: formula_19
is called the magnetization current density, and
: formula_20
is the polarization current density. Taking the equation for :
: formula_21

Consequently, referring to the definition of the bound current:
: formula_22
as was to be shown.

== Ampère&#x27;s circuital law in cgs units ==
In cgs units, the integral form of the equation, including Maxwell&#x27;s correction, reads
: formula_23
where is the speed of light.

The differential form of the equation (again, including Maxwell&#x27;s correction) is
: formula_24

<doc id="199306" wikidata="Q421809" url="?curid=199306" title="VX (nerve agent)">
<text>VX is an extremely toxic synthetic chemical compound in the organophosphorus class, specifically, a thiophosphonate. In the class of nerve agents, it was developed for military use in chemical warfare after translation of earlier discoveries of organophosphate toxicity in pesticide research. In its pure form, VX is an oily, relatively non-volatile liquid that is amber-like in colour. Because of its low volatility, VX persists in environments where it is dispersed.

VX, short for &quot;venomous agent X&quot;, is one of the best known of the V nerve agents and originated from pesticide development work at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). It was developed further at Porton Down in England during the early 1950s, based on research first done by Gerhard Schrader, a chemist working for IG Farben in Germany during the 1930s. It is now one of a broader V-series of agents which are classified as nerve agents. VX has been allegedly used in warfare and has been used in several assassinations. The brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Kim Jong Nam, had the substance thrown in his face in Kuala Lumpur International Airport on February 13, 2017, by two women. He died while being rushed to hospital approximately 15 minutes later. 

The substance is extremely deadly: VX fatalities occur with exposure to tens of milligram quantities via inhalation or absorption through skin. It is more potent than sarin, another nerve agent with a similar mechanism of action. On such exposure, these agents severely disrupt the body&#x27;s signaling between the nervous and muscular systems, leading to a prolonged neuromuscular blockade, flaccid paralysis of all the muscles in the body including the diaphragm, and death by asphyxiation.

The danger of VX, in particular, lies in direct exposure to the chemical agent persisting where it was dispersed, and not through its evaporating and being distributed as a vapor; it is not considered a vapor hazard due to its relative non-volatility. VX is considered an area denial weapon due to these physical and biochemical characteristics. As a chemical weapon, it is categorized as a weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations and is banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993, where production and stockpiling of VX exceeding per year is outlawed. The only exception is for &quot;research, medical or pharmaceutical purposes outside a single small-scale facility in aggregate quantities not exceeding per year per facility&quot;.
==Physical properties==
VX is an odorless and tasteless chiral organophosphorous chemical with a molecular weight of 267.37 g/mol. Under standard conditions it is an amber-coloured liquid with a boiling point of , and a freezing point of . Its density is similar to that of water. It has a log P value of 2.047, meaning it is relatively hydrophobic with about 100-fold more partitioning into octanol, over water. Its low vapor pressure of gives it a low volatility, resulting in a high persistence in the environment.

When weaponized, it can be dispersed as a liquid, aerosol or as a mixture with a clay or talc thickening agent.

==Mechanism of action==
VX is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.
It blocks the function of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Normally, when a motor neuron is stimulated, it releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) into the space between the neuron and an adjacent muscle cell, the synaptic cleft. When acetylcholine binds to nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction, it stimulates muscle contraction. To avoid a state of constant muscle contraction, the acetylcholine is then broken down (hydrolysed) into the inactive substances acetic acid and choline by AChE. VX blocks the action of AChE, resulting in an accumulation of acetylcholine in the space between the neuron and muscle cell. On a molecular level, this leads to the ongoing stimulation and eventual fatigue of all affected muscarinic and nicotinic ACh receptors. This results in initial violent contractions, followed by sustained supercontraction restricted to the fluid (sarcoplasm) of the subjunctional endplate and prolonged, depolarizing neuromuscular blockade. The prolonged blockade results in flaccid paralysis of all the muscles in the body, and it is such sustained paralysis of the diaphragm muscle that causes death by asphyxiation.
Accumulation of acetylcholine in the brain also causes neuronal excitotoxicity, due to activation of nicotinic receptors and glutamate release.

The extreme toxicity of VX is partly due to the fact that the inhibitor was designed to be an excellent structural mimic for the transition state of the natural substrate (acetylcholine) of acetylcholinesterase. VX has a very high &quot;on-rate&quot; to react with the target enzyme and form a stable P-O-C bond (phosphorylation). However, compared with other highly toxic nerve agents like soman or sarin, VX undergoes relatively slow &quot;aging&quot;. Aging is a time-dependent side reaction (loss of an alkoxyl group) that occurs on nerve agents after phosphorylation and renders the nerve agent-acetylcholinesterase complex highly resistant to regeneration by any known antidote. Slower aging by VX suggests it should be possible to develop more effective antidotes and treatments.

The reaction products of acetylcholinesterase with VX before and after the &quot;aging&quot; reaction were solved in near atomic resolution by X-ray crystallography to aid in antidote development. The X-ray structures revealed the specific parts of the VX molecule that interact with key residues and sub-sites of the target enzyme. The structural kinetic of phosphorylation followed by aging also showed an unexpected conformational change in the catalytic triad suggestive of an &quot;induced fit&quot; between the VX molecule and acetylcholinesterase.

==Chemistry==
===Synthesis===
VX is chiral at its phosphorus atom. The individual enantiomers are identified as &quot;S&quot;P-(−)-VX, and &quot;R&quot;P-(+)-VX (where the &quot;P&quot; subscript highlights that the chirality is at phosphorus).

VX is produced via the transester process, which gives a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers. This entails a series of steps whereby phosphorus trichloride is methylated to produce methyl phosphonous dichloride. The resulting material is reacted with ethanol to form a diester. This is then transesterified with &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-diisopropylaminoethanol to produce QL,
a mixed phosphonite. Finally, this immediate precursor is reacted with sulfur to form VX.

VX can also be delivered in binary chemical weapons which mix in-flight to form the agent prior to release. Binary VX is referred to as VX2, and is created by mixing QL with sulfur as is done in the Bigeye aerial chemical bomb. It may also be produced by mixing with sulfur compounds, as with the liquid dimethyl polysulfide mixture (known as NM) in the canceled XM736 8-inch projectile program.

===Solvolysis===
Like other organophosphorus nerve agents, VX may be destroyed by reaction with strong nucleophiles. The reaction of VX with concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide results in two competing solvolysis reactions: cleavage of either the P–O or P–S esters. Although the P–S cleavage is the dominant pathway, the product of P–O bond cleavage is the toxic phosphonic thioester EA-2192 and both reactions are slow. In contrast, reaction with the hydroperoxide anion (hydroperoxidolysis) leads to exclusive cleavage of the P–S bond and a more rapid overall reaction.



=== Symptoms of exposure ===
Early symptoms of skin contact include local sweating and muscular twitching at the area of exposure, followed by nausea or vomiting. Early symptoms of exposure to VX vapor include rhinorrhea (runny nose) and tightness in the chest with shortness of breath (bronchial constriction). Miosis (pinpointing of the pupils) may be an early sign of agent exposure but is not usually used as the only indicator of exposure.

===Toxicology===
VX is extremely toxic. The potentially fatal dose is only slightly higher than the dose having any effect at all, and the effects of a fatal dose are so rapid that there is little time for treatment. The median lethal dose (LD50), the exposure required to kill half of a tested population, as estimated for 70 kg human males via exposure to the skin is reported to be 5 to 10 mg.

===Treatment===
When treating VX exposure, primary consideration is given to removal of the liquid agent from the skin, before removal of the individual to an uncontaminated area or atmosphere. After this, the victim is decontaminated by washing the contaminated areas with household bleach and flushing with clean water, followed by removal of contaminated clothing and further skin decontamination. When possible, decontamination is completed before the casualty is taken for further medical treatment.

An individual known to have been exposed to a nerve agent, or who exhibits definite signs or symptoms of nerve-agent exposure is generally given the antidotes atropine and pralidoxime (2-PAM), and in the case of convulsions an injected sedative or antiepileptic such as diazepam. In several nations the nerve agent antidotes are issued for military personnel in the form of an autoinjector such as the United States military Mark I NAAK.

Atropine blocks a subset of acetylcholine receptors known as muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAchRs), so that the buildup of acetylcholine produced by loss of the acetylcholinesterase function has a reduced effect on their target receptor. 2-PAM reactivates the acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE), thus reversing the effects of VX. VX and other organophosphates block AChE activity by binding to and covalently inactivating the enzyme via transfer of the phosphonate moiety from VX to the active site of AChE; this inactivates AChE and produces an inactive by-product from the remaining portion of the VX molecule. Pralidoxime (2-PAM) removes this phosphate group.

===Diagnostic tests===
Controlled studies in humans have shown that minimally toxic doses cause 70–75% depression of erythrocyte cholinesterase within several hours of exposure. The serum level of ethyl methylphosphonic acid (EMPA), a VX hydrolysis product, was measured to confirm exposure in one poisoning victim. There also exist procedures for determination of VX hydrolysis products in urine and of VX adducts to albumin in blood.

==History==
===Discovery===
The chemists Ranajit Ghosh and J. F. Newman discovered the V-series nerve agents at the British firm ICI in 1952, patenting diethyl &quot;S&quot;-2-diethylaminoethyl phosphonothioate (agent VG) in November 1952. Further commercial research on similar compounds ceased in 1955 when its lethality to humans was discovered. The U.S. started production of large amounts of VX in 1961 at Newport Chemical Depot.

The discovery occurred when the chemists were investigating a class of organophosphate compounds (organophosphate esters of substituted aminoethanethiols). Like Gerhard Schrader, an earlier investigator of organophosphates, Ghosh found that they were quite effective pesticides. In 1954, ICI put one of them on the market under the trade name Amiton. It was subsequently withdrawn, as it was too toxic for safe use. The toxicity did not go unnoticed, and samples of it were sent to the British government research facility at Porton Down in Wiltshire for evaluation. After the evaluation was complete, several members of this class of compounds became a new group of nerve agents, the V agents. The best-known of these is probably VX, assigned the UK Rainbow Code Purple Possum, with the Russian V-Agent (VR) coming a close second (Amiton is largely forgotten as VG). The name is a contraction of the words &quot;venomous agent X&quot;.

Beginning in 1959, the United States Army began volunteer testing of VX in humans. Dr. Van M. Sim underwent an intravenous infusion of VX to evaluate its effects and to establish a baseline for future experimentation. After approximately 3.5 hours following initial administration of the agent, Sim suddenly became pale and delirious. The experiment was immediately terminated to preserve his life. In their conclusion, the researchers estimated that 2.12 μg/kg of VX delivered intravenously over the course of several hours would be the maximum tolerable dosage and that any more would risk death in a human subject.

===Use as a weapon===
In 1988, a United Nations inquiry established that Cuba was responsible for deploying VX against Angolan insurgents during the Angolan Civil War. UN toxicologists obtained trace elements of VX from soil, water, and plant samples taken from areas where Cuban troops had recently carried out counter-insurgency operations. Patients demonstrating symptoms of exposure to nerve agents first began appearing in Angolan hospitals around 1984.

There was evidence of a combination of chemical agents having been used by Iraq against the Kurds in the Halabja chemical attack in 1988 under Saddam Hussein, including VX. Hussein later testified to UNSCOM that Iraq had researched VX but had failed to weaponize the agent due to production failure. After U.S. and allied forces invaded Iraq, no VX agent or production facilities were found. However, UNSCOM laboratories detected traces of VX on warhead remnants.

In December 1994 and January 1995, Masami Tsuchiya of Aum Shinrikyo synthesized of VX which was used to attack three people. Two people were injured, and one 28-year-old man died, who was the first victim of VX ever documented in the world at that time. The VX victim, whom Shoko Asahara had suspected as a spy, was attacked at 7:00 am on December 12, 1994, on the street in Osaka by Tomomitsu Niimi and another AUM member, who sprinkled the nerve agent on his neck. He chased them for about 90 metres (100 yd) before collapsing, dying ten days later without ever coming out of a deep coma. Doctors in the hospital suspected at the time he had been poisoned with an organophosphate pesticide, but the cause of death was pinned down only after cult members arrested for the Tokyo subway sarin attack confessed to the killing. Metabolites of VX such as ethyl methylphosphonate, methylphosphonic acid and diisopropyl-2-(methylthio)ethylamine were later found in samples of the victim&#x27;s blood seven months after his murder. Unlike the cases for sarin gas (the Matsumoto incident and the attack on the Tokyo subway), VX was not used for mass murder.

On February 13, 2017, Kim Jong-nam, half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, died after an assault at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia. According to the authorities he was murdered by poisoning with VX which was found on his face. The authorities further reported that one of the women suspected of applying the nerve agent experienced some physical symptoms of VX-poisoning. The director of a non-proliferation research program of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey stated that VX fumes would have killed the suspected attackers even if they had been wearing gloves, suggesting that the VX was applied as two non-lethal components that would mix to form VX only on the victim&#x27;s face.

===Worldwide stockpiles===
Some countries known to possess VX are the United States (prior to 2022), Russia, North Korea, and Syria. A Sudanese pharmaceutical facility, the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory, was bombed by the U.S. in 1998 acting on information that it produced VX and that the origin of the agent was associated with both Iraq and Al Qaeda. The U.S. had obtained soil samples identified as containing &quot;O&quot;-ethyl hydrogen methylphosphonothioate (EMPTA), a chemical used in the production of VX which may also have commercial applications. Chemical weapons experts later suggested that the widely used fonofos organophosphate insecticide could have been mistaken for EMPTA. Cuba obtained VX during the 1980s and deployed it during its military intervention in Angola.

In 1969, the U.S. government cancelled its chemical weapons programs, banned the production of VX in the United States, and began the destruction of its stockpiles of agents by a variety of methods. Early disposal included the U.S. Army&#x27;s CHASE (Cut Holes And Sink &#x27;Em) program, in which old ships were filled with chemical weapons stockpiles and then scuttled. CHASE 8 was conducted on June 15, 1967, in which the steamship &quot;Cpl. Eric G. Gibson&quot; was filled with 7,380 VX rockets and scuttled in of water off the coast of Atlantic City, New Jersey. Incineration was used for VX stockpile destruction starting in 1990 with Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System in the North Pacific with other incineration plants following at Deseret Chemical Depot, Pine Bluff Arsenal, Umatilla Chemical Depot and Anniston Army Depot with the last of the VX inventory at these facilities destroyed on December 24, 2008. After 2008 the United States&#x27; only remaining stockpile of chemical weapons was located at the Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky, which housed the last stockpiles of sarin (GB), mustard gas (H) and VX. The Blue Grass stockpile consisted of 101,764 warheads and canisters containing a total of 523 tons of chemical agents loaded onto M55 (rocket), M104 155 mm caliber howitzer and M426 8-inch shell artillery shells. Efforts to destroy these agents began in 2019, with the goal of eliminating the United States entire stockpile of chemical weapons by September 30, 2023. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in September of 2022 that the last of the United States&#x27; stockpile of VX gas had been destroyed, confirming that the last VX rocket was dismantled and destroyed on April 19, 2022. 

====Stockpile elimination====
Worldwide, VX disposal has continued since 1997 under the mandate of the Chemical Weapons Convention. When the convention entered force, the parties declared worldwide stockpiles of of VX. As of December 2015, 98% of the stockpiles had been destroyed.

In fiscal year 2008, the U.S. Department of Defense released a study finding that the United States had dumped at least of VX into the Atlantic Ocean off the coasts of New York/New Jersey and Florida between 1969 and 1970. This material consisted of nearly 22,000 M55 rockets, 19 bulk containers holding each, and one M23 chemical landmine.

The Newport Chemical Depot began VX stockpile elimination using chemical neutralization in 2005. VX was hydrolyzed to much less toxic byproducts by using concentrated caustic solution, and the resulting waste was then shipped off-site for further processing. Technical and political issues regarding this secondary byproduct resulted in delays, but the depot completed their VX stockpile destruction in August 2008.

The remaining VX stockpile in the U.S. was treated by the Blue Grass Chemical Agent-Destruction Pilot Plant in Kentucky, part of the Program Executive Office, Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives program. The program was established as an alternative to the incineration process successfully used by the Army Chemical Materials Agency, which completed its stockpile destruction activities in March 2012. The Blue Grass Pilot Plant has been plagued by repeated cost over-runs and schedule slippages since its inception.

In Russia, the U.S. provided support for these destruction activities with the Nunn-Lugar Global Cooperation Initiative. The Initiative has been able to convert a former chemical weapons depot at Shchuchye, Kurgan Oblast into a facility to destroy those chemical weapons. The new facility, which opened in May 2009, has been working on eliminating the nearly of nerve agents held at the former storage complex. However, this facility only held about 14% of Russian chemical weapons, which were stored at seven sites.

The last of the United States remaining stockpile of chemical agents was destroyed on July 7, 2023 with President Biden issuing a press statement that the last of the United States&#x27; chemical weapons had been destroyed. The United States was the last of the eight countries that signed the Chemical Weapons Convention to destroy its entire stockpile, this was due to adhering to higher safety protocols than other countries, the government wanted to ensure the protection of both the public and the workers above all, which actually put the United States in violation of the treaty as the last of the stockpile was destroyed after the deadline; the United States&#x27; stockpile was the last stockpile of chemical weapons in the world. Although the destruction of the stockpiles does not make the world completely free of chemical weapons, there are nations that have used chemical weapons covertly in recent years like Syria deploying chlorine gas during the Syrian civil war, Russia has used chemical agents for assassinations and North Korea&#x27;s leader Kim Jong Un used a VX-based nerve agent to kill his half brother Kim Jong-nam.

==In popular culture==
One of the best-known references to VX in popular culture is its use in the 1996 film &quot;The Rock&quot;, which centers on a threatened VX attack on San Francisco from the island of Alcatraz. The film uses artistic license, notably with VX being ascribed corrosive powers it does not possess, permitting an early scene in which a VX victim is shown with his face melting, rather than dying through asphyxiation. 

Other references to VX are found in the 2012 film &quot;It&#x27;s a Disaster&quot; in which it is revealed that a nearby dirty bomb attack was a VX attack, prompting the four couples to contemplate a suicide pact, as well as the 2015 film &quot;&quot;, in which series protagonist Ethan Hunt steals VX nerve gas from Chechen separatists on their way to Syria. Also season 5 of the TV series &quot;24&quot;, has a similar storyline. The fifth episode of the 2020 anime series &quot;The Millionaire Detective Balance: Unlimited&quot; features a tear gas bomb with canisters loaded with VX gas and placed inside a cabinet of a safe room within the embassy; the protagonist Daisuke Kambe and two other characters were trapped inside the room after relocating themselves due to security reasons, and figuring out how to escape before the bomb detonates.

The album &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot; by the industrial band Skinny Puppy contains a song about chemical weapons called &quot;VX Gas Attack&quot;.

In the BBC show &quot;Spooks&quot;, series 2 episode 5, a dirty bomb using VX is said to have gone off in a &quot;training exercise&quot;. Artistic license is also used in this story, as VX is described as a gas, with &quot;chlorine bonding&quot; making it &quot;almost indestructible.&quot; An incorrect formula is given, showing a diester rather than a thioester. 

In the video game &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Gone to the Rapture&quot;, VX is alluded to as a nerve agent used by the government to contain a pattern which infects and kills humans and other animals.

In the book &quot;Nightshade&quot;, the twelfth book in the Alex Rider Series, VX plays a major role, as it is used by terrorists in an attempt to kill over half of the British government.

In the book &quot;Ice Cold&quot;, the eighth Rizzoli and Isles novel by Tess Gerritsen, VX gas is featured and responsible for many deaths.

The second episode of the TV series &quot;Seal Team&quot; (season 1) focuses on a chemical weapons lab in an abandoned hospital, producing VX gas.

In the Netflix show &quot;Designated Survivor&quot;, agent Hannah Wells is killed by VX in season 3, episode 7.

In the CBS show &quot;MacGyver&quot;, season 2 episode 9, a VX canister is the main plot point.

In the 2003 video game &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield&quot;, the acquisition of VX by terrorists is a major plot point in both versions of the game.

In the Crackle show &quot;Startup&quot;, American soldiers discover a computer used by apparent terrorists in Aleppo, Syria. &quot;VX components&quot; are displayed as an item for purchase on the computer, which is logged into Araknet, a dark web created by the protagonists of the series.

Metal Gear includes references to VX nerve gas in its plotlines, often as a lethal chemical threat within its espionage and warfare scenarios.

<text>Coxey&#x27;s Army was a protest march by unemployed workers from the United States, led by Ohio businessman Jacob Coxey. They marched on Washington, D.C., in 1894, the second year of a four-year economic depression that was the worst in United States history at the time. Officially named the Army of the Commonwealth in Christ, its nickname came from its leader and was more enduring. It was the first significant popular protest march on Washington, and the expression &quot;Enough food to feed Coxey&#x27;s Army&quot; originates from this march.

==First march==
The purpose of the march, termed a &quot;petition in boots&quot;, was to protest the unemployment caused by the Panic of 1893 and to lobby for the government to create jobs which would involve building roads and other public works improvements, with workers paid in paper currency which would expand the currency in circulation, consistent with populist ideology. The march originated with 100 men in Massillon, Ohio, on March 25, 1894, passing through Pittsburgh, Becks Run and Homestead, Pennsylvania, in April.

The Army&#x27;s western section received the nickname Kelley&#x27;s Army, after California leader &quot;General&quot; Charles T. Kelley. Although larger at its beginning, Kelley&#x27;s Army lost members on its long journey; few made it past the Ohio River. Another group, Fry&#x27;s Army, began marching in Los Angeles, but largely dissipated east of St. Louis. Various groups from around the country gathered to join the march, and its number had grown to 500 with more on the way from further west when it reached Washington on April 30, 1894. The Shreve farm site at current day Colmar Manor, Maryland, was used by the 6,000 jobless men as a camp site. Coxey and other leaders of the movement were arrested the next day for walking on the grass of the United States Capitol. Interest in the march and protest rapidly dwindled. Although it was ultimately unsuccessful, the march is notable as the first protest march on Washington, D.C.

Some of the most militant Coxeyites were those who formed their own &quot;armies&quot; in Pacific Northwest centers such as Butte, Tacoma, Spokane, and Portland. Many of these protesters were unemployed railroad workers who blamed railroad companies, President Grover Cleveland&#x27;s monetary policies, and excessive freight rates for their plight. The climax of this movement was perhaps on April 21, 1894, when William Hogan and approximately 500 followers commandeered a Union Pacific Railroad train for their trek to Washington, D.C. They enjoyed support along the way, which enabled them to fight off the federal marshals attempting to stop them. Federal troops finally apprehended the Hoganites near Forsyth, Montana. While the protesters never made it to the capital, the military intervention they provoked proved to be a rehearsal for the federal force that broke the Pullman Strike later that year.

==Second march==

Coxey organized a second march in 1914. A portion of the march reached Monessen, Pennsylvania, on April 30. Another contingent from New York City merged with the march.
When the march reached Washington, D.C., Coxey addressed a crowd of supporters from the steps of the United States Capitol.

==Legacy==
Although Coxey&#x27;s proposal for government jobs was radical for its time, it came to be part of U.S. federal policy with the passing of the New Deal. On May 1, 1944, Coxey was asked to read his original petition from the steps of the Capitol. More significantly, marches on Washington became a popular way for people to express their displeasure at the government or various of its policies.

==Coxey&#x27;s Army in culture==

Among the people observing the march was L. Frank Baum, before he gained fame. There are political interpretations of his book, the &quot;Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, which have often been related to Coxey&#x27;s Army. In the novel, Dorothy, the Scarecrow (the American farmer), Tin Woodman (the industrial worker), and Cowardly Lion (William Jennings Bryan), march on the yellow brick road to the Emerald City, the Capital (or Washington, D.C.), demanding relief from the Wizard, who is interpreted to be the President. Dorothy&#x27;s shoes (made of silver in the book, not the familiar ruby that is depicted in the movie) are interpreted to symbolize using free silver instead of the gold standard (the road of yellow brick) because the shortage of gold precipitated the Panic of 1893. In the film adaptation of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, the silver shoes were turned into ruby for the cinematic effect of color, as Technicolor was still in its early years when the movie was produced. However, this theory was not advanced until many decades after the book was written.

The phrase Coxey&#x27;s Army has also come to refer to a ragtag band, possibly due to an incident during the second march in 1914.

Coxey&#x27;s Army also plays a prominent role in Garet Garrett&#x27;s &quot;The Driver&quot;, in which the main character is a journalist following the march.

In his story &quot;Two Thousand Stiffs&quot; (published in hardcover as part of the 1907 collection &quot;The Road&quot;), Jack London describes his experiences as a member of Kelley&#x27;s Army. The story gives a vivid account on a personal level of the motivations of the unemployed &quot;stiffs&quot;, the military style organization of their army, and the more and less willing support given them by more fortunate Americans who were still sympathetic to their cause. In London&#x27;s description, he joined Kelley&#x27;s Army at Council Bluffs, Iowa, and remained with it until its dissolution at the Mississippi River, a dissolution caused primarily by the inability to capture trains for transportation from an alerted railroad industry.

In the 1955 play &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;, Meeker (the jailer/bailiff) mentions Coxey&#x27;s Army when talking to Rachel Brown in an early scene.

Coxey&#x27;s Army&#x27;s arrival in Washington, D.C., sets the backdrop of the 2016 historical murder mystery, &quot;A March To Remember,&quot; by Anna Loan-Wilsey ().

The antiquated expression &quot;Enough food to feed Coxey&#x27;s Army&quot; signifies that the person commenting believes there is a great deal more food being prepared or presented than is actually required for the persons to be fed.

In the prologue to &quot;On the Way Home,&quot; the diary of Laura Ingalls Wilder of her family&#x27;s trip from De Smet, South Dakota, to Mansfield, Missouri, in 1894, there is mention of Coxey&#x27;s armies. The prologue (and epilogue) to &quot;On the Way Home&quot; were written by Wilder&#x27;s daughter Rose Wilder Lane, who was an accomplished and well-known writer long before her mother. Lane describes Coxey&#x27;s armies as coming from California, seizing railroad trains as they headed East towards Washington, and terrorizing towns and pillaging for food on their route. Lane concluded, &quot;In all the cities Federal troops were guarding the Government&#x27;s buildings.&quot;

<doc id="199312" wikidata="Q2092064" url="?curid=199312" title="Haemophilia A">
<text>Haemophilia A (or hemophilia A) is a blood clotting disorder caused by a genetic deficiency in clotting factor VIII, thereby resulting in significant susceptibility to bleeding, both internally and externally. This condition occurs almost exclusively in males born to carrier mothers due to X-linked recessive inheritance. Nevertheless, rare isolated cases do emerge from de novo (spontaneous) mutations.

The medical management of individuals with hemophilia A frequently entails the administration of factor VIII medication through slow intravenous injection. This intervention aims to address and preempt additional bleeding episodes in affected individuals.

==Signs and symptoms==

Haemophilia A&#x27;s phenotype has a quite wide range of symptoms encompassing both internal and external bleeding episodes. Individuals with more severe haemophilia tend to experience more intense and frequent bleeding, whereas those with mild haemophilia typically exhibit milder symptoms unless subjected to surgical procedures or significant trauma. Those with moderate haemophilia may display variable symptoms, falling within the spectrum between severe and mild forms.

One common early indicator of haemophilia is prolonged bleeding from venepuncture or heelpricks. These signs often prompt blood tests that confirm the presence of haemophilia. In individuals, especially those with moderate or mild haemophilia, any form of trauma can trigger the first significant bleed. Haemophilia substantially elevates the risk of protracted bleeding from ordinary injuries, and in severe cases, bleeding can occur spontaneously without an apparent cause. Bleeding episodes can manifest anywhere in the body. Superficial bleeding resulting from abrasions or shallow lacerations may persist, with scabs easily breaking due to the deficiency of fibrin, potentially leading to re-bleeding. While superficial bleeding poses challenges, more critical sites of bleeding include:
* Joints
* Muscles
* Digestive tract
* Brain

===Complications===
One therapeutic conundrum is the development of &quot;inhibitor&quot; antibodies against factor VIII due to frequent infusions. These develop as the body recognises the infused factor VIII as foreign, as the body does not produce its own &quot;copy&quot;. In these individuals, activated factor VII, a protein in the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade, can be infused as a treatment for haemorrhage in individuals with haemophilia and antibodies against replacement factor VIII.

=== Oral Manifestations ===
The oral manifestations are characterized by frequent bleeding of multiple sites, frequently seen as gingival and postextraction haemorrhages. The symptoms depend on the severity of haemophilia. In the case of severe haemophilia, patients may complain of multiple oral bleeding episodes throughout their life. Haemophilia patients are considered to be a special group of patients as routinely done procedures may be fatal in them. It was seen that almost 14% of all haemophilia patients and 30% of cases with a mild type of haemophilia have been diagnosed early following an episode of severe oral bleeding, of which the most common sites were the labial frenum and the tongue.

==Genetics==

Haemophilia A is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait. It occurs in males and in homozygous females (which is only possible in the daughters of a haemophilic male and a carrier or haemophiliac female). However, mild haemophilia A is known to occur in heterozygous females due to X-inactivation, so it is recommended that levels of factor VIII and IX be measured in all known or potential carriers prior to surgery and in the event of clinically significant bleeding.

About 5-10% of people with haemophilia A are affected because they make a dysfunctional version of the factor VIII protein, while the remainder are affected because they produce factor VIII in insufficient amounts (quantitative deficiency). Of those who have severe deficiency (defined as &lt;1% activity of factor VIII), 45-50% have the same mutation, an inversion within the factor VIII gene that results in total elimination of protein production.

Since both forms of haemophilia can be caused by a variety of different mutations, initial diagnosis and classification is done by measurement of protein activity rather than by genetic tests, though genetic tests are recommended for testing of family members once a known case of haemophilia is identified. Approximately 30% of patients have no family history; their disease is presumably caused by new mutations.

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis of haemophilia A may be suspected as coagulation testing reveals an increased partial thromboplastin time (PTT) in the context of a normal prothrombin time (PT) and bleeding time. PTT tests are the first blood test done when haemophilia is indicated. However, the diagnosis is made in the presence of very low levels of factor VIII. A family history is frequently present, although not essential. Recently, genetic testing has been made available to determine an individual&#x27;s risk of attaining or passing on haemophilia. Diagnosis of haemophilia A also includes a severity level, which can range from mild to severe based on the amount of active and functioning factor VIII detected in the blood. Factor VIII levels do not typically change throughout an individual&#x27;s lifetime. Severe haemophilia A is the most common severity, occurring in the majority of affected people. Individuals with mild haemophilia often experience few or no bleeding episodes except in the case of serious trauma (i.e. tooth extraction, or surgery).

===Severity===
There are numerous different mutations which can cause haemophilia A, due to differences in changes to the factor VIII gene (and the resulting protein). Individuals with haemophilia often have some level of active clotting factor. Individuals with less than 1% active factor are classified as having &quot;severe haemophilia&quot;, those with 1–5% active factor have &quot;moderate haemophilia&quot;, and those with &quot;mild haemophilia&quot; have between 5–40% of normal levels of active clotting factor.

===Differential diagnosis===
Two of the most common differential diagnoses are haemophilia B which is a deficiency in Factor IX and von Willebrand Disease which is a deficiency in von Willebrand factor (needed for the proper functioning of Factor VIII); haemophilia C is also considered.

==Treatment==
Most individuals with severe haemophilia require regular supplementation with intravenous plasma concentrate factor VIII or efanesoctocog alfa, a von Willebrand factor (VWF) independent, recombinant DNA-derived Factor VIII (FVIII) concentrate shown to prevent bleeding in children and adults. Treatment dosing and frequency of plasma concentrate Factor VIII may be variable and individually determined; dosing of efanesoctocog alfa shown effective is an IV injection of once-weekly 50 IU per kilogram of body weight.

In children, an easily accessible intravenous port may have to be inserted to minimise frequent traumatic intravenous cannulation. These devices have made prophylaxis in haemophilia much easier for families because the problems of finding a vein for infusion several times a week are eliminated. However, there are risks involved with their use, the most worrisome being that of infection, studies differ but some show an infection rate that is high. These infections can usually be treated with intravenous antibiotics but sometimes the device must be removed, also, there are other studies that show a risk of clots forming at the tip of the catheter, rendering it useless. Some individuals with severe haemophilia, and most with moderate and mild haemophilia, treat only as needed without a regular prophylactic schedule. Mild haemophiliacs often manage their condition with desmopressin, a drug which releases stored factor VIII from blood vessel walls.

=== Dental considerations ===
If numbing is necessary for dental procedures, the nerve block (typically to the inferior alveolar nerve) should only be given after raising clotting factor levels by appropriate replacement therapy, as there is a risk of bleeding into the muscles along with potential airway compromise due to a haematoma in the retromolar or pterygoid space. The intraligamental technique or interosseous technique should be considered instead of the mandibular block. Articaine has been used as a buccal infiltration to anaesthetize the lower molar teeth. A lingual infiltration also requires appropriate factor replacement since the injection is into an area with a rich plexus of blood vessels and the needle is not adjacent to bone.

===Gene therapy===
In December 2017, it was reported that doctors had used a new form of gene therapy to treat haemophilia A. Current treatment efforts utilize adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, however recent studies have found lentiviral vectors (LV) as being a more effective alternative. 

=== Monoclonal antibodies ===
Monoclonal antibody emicizumab has been approved by the FDA in 2017 for therapy of hemophilia A.

In July 2024, a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrated that efanesoctocog alfa, a bioengineered human factor VIII recombinant protein, prophylaxis for children with severe hemophilia A could have therapeutic benefit leading to effective bleeding prevention.

== Prognosis ==
Two Dutch studies have followed haemophilia patients for a number of years. Both studies found that viral infections were common in haemophiliacs due to the frequent blood transfusions which put them at risk of acquiring blood borne infections, such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. In the latest study which followed patients from 1992 to 2001, the male life expectancy was 59 years. If cases with known viral infections were excluded, the life expectancy was 72, close to that of the general population. 26% of the cases died from AIDS and 22% from hepatitis C. However, these statistics for prognosis are unreliable as there has been marked improvement of infection control and efficacy of anti-retroviral drugs since these studies were done.

==Epidemiology==
Haemophilia A occurs in approximately 1 in 5,000 males, while the incidence of haemophilia B is 1 in 30,000 in the male population, of these, 85% have haemophilia A and 15% have haemophilia B.

<text>Frank Sargeson () (born Norris Frank Davey; 23 March 1903 – 1 March 1982) was a New Zealand short story writer and novelist. Born in Hamilton, Sargeson had a middle-class and puritanical upbringing, and initially worked as a lawyer. After travelling to the United Kingdom for two years and working as a clerk on his return, he was convicted of indecent assault for a homosexual encounter and moved to live on his uncle&#x27;s farm for a period. Having already written and published some short stories in the late 1920s, he began to focus on his writing and moved into his parents&#x27; holiday cottage where he would live for the rest of his life.

Sargeson became an influential figure in New Zealand writing, and his work continues to be recognised as a major influence on New Zealand literature. Sargeson is known for his minimalist and sparse style, with a focus on unhappy and isolated male characters, and has been credited with introducing everyday New Zealand English to literature. He published over forty short stories in the 1930s and 1940s, and later works included novels, plays and autobiographies. He also mentored and supported other young New Zealand writers, most notably Janet Frame.

==Early life and education==
Sargeson was born in Hamilton, New Zealand on 23 March 1903, the second of four children. His name at birth was Norris Frank Davey but he would later adopt the surname of his mother, Rachel Sargeson. Although later in life Sargeson became known for his literary depiction of the laconic and unsophisticated New Zealand working-class men, his upbringing was comfortable and middle-class, if puritanical; his father, Edwin Davey, was the Hamilton town clerk and an active campaigner against social ills such as alcohol and gambling. Both his parents were active Methodists.

He attended Hamilton West School followed by Hamilton High School. From 1921 onwards he worked in solicitors&#x27; offices and studied law by distance through Auckland University College, as well as spending time at the farm of his mother&#x27;s brother, Oakley Sargeson, in Ōkahukura, King Country. Although outwardly conforming with his parents&#x27; expectations, Sargeson was struggling inwardly with his sexuality and what he wanted to do with his life. In 1925, after an argument with his mother because she read his private correspondence, he moved to Auckland to continue his studies, and obtained his legal qualifications in 1926. He began writing short stories in the late 1920s.

Upon completing his training as a solicitor, Sargeson left New Zealand in February 1927 and spent two years in the United Kingdom, where he travelled, wrote about his experiences and had his first open homosexual relationship, with an interior decorator who was 14 years older than him. He returned to New Zealand in 1928 and was unable to find work either as a solicitor or as a journalist. He was eventually hired as a clerk by the Public Trust Office in Wellington, where he worked for 15 months. In 1929, as a condition of a two-year suspended sentence he received for indecent assault due to a homosexual encounter, he was required to leave Wellington to live with his uncle in Ōkahukura, where he spent 18 months working on the farm and writing. During this time he successfully published an article about his European travels in &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; in May 1930 and also completed his first novel, which was rejected by publishers.

==Start of writing career==
In May 1931, Sargeson took permanent residence in his parents&#x27; holiday cottage (or bach) in Takapuna. He was to remain at the bach as a full-time writer for most of the rest of his life. The bach was primitive and was described by Sargeson as &quot;nothing more than a small one-roomed hut in a quiet street ending in a no-man&#x27;s land of mangrove mud-flats that belonged to the inner harbour. It was very decayed, with weather-boards falling off.&quot;

It was at this time that he began using the name Frank Sargeson, in part to hide his criminal conviction, in part as a rejection of his parents&#x27; middle-class values, and in part in tribute to his uncle Oakley Sargeson. Early on he registered for unemployment benefits in order to be able to spend as much time as possible writing; he said he wished to produce work &quot;which would be marked by an individual flavour: there would be a certain quality which would be recognised as my own and nobody else&#x27;s&quot;. He began to grow fruit and vegetables and to take in people who were struggling financially or on the social fringes of society, who he described as the &quot;odds-and-ends kind of people I tend naturally to cherish and try to comfort&quot;.

He began to establish a reputation in the writing world from 1935 onwards, with short stories contributed to the left-wing magazine &quot;Tomorrow&quot;. This led to the publication of a collection, &quot;Conversation with My Uncle, and Other Sketches&quot;, in 1936. His short stories from this time demonstrate the features that would come to characterise his style: minimalist and austere narration and characters, and the use of everyday New Zealand spoken English, and showed the influence of the American writer Sherwood Anderson, whose stories Sargeson was reading at the time. In late 1939, Sargeson was diagnosed with surgical tuberculosis, which meant he was excused from conscription in World War II and eligible for an invalid&#x27;s benefit.

==Literary success and post-war years==
By 1940, more than forty of Sargeson&#x27;s short stories had been published and he had established a significant reputation in New Zealand as a writer. That year, his story &quot;The Making of a New Zealander&quot; won first-equal prize in a competition held to mark New Zealand&#x27;s centennial, and his second short story collection, &quot;A Man and His Wife&quot;, was published by Caxton Press. He was also receiving international attention, with his work appearing in journals in Australia, the UK and the USA, in John Lehmann&#x27;s anthologies and periodicals such as &quot;Penguin New Writing&quot;. &quot;The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature&quot; (2006) said that Sargeson &quot;dominated&quot; New Zealand short fiction at this time, with his &quot;wry sketches or ostensible yarns about apparently undistinguished characters and minor occurrences&quot;, in which &quot;the characters are depicted as itinerant labourers or unemployed men, seldom happily married and frequently without any apparent family connection&quot;.

He also was increasingly becoming part of the New Zealand literary community through his friendships with other local writers (including A. R. D. Fairburn, Robin Hyde, Jane Mander, Denis Glover and others). In 1945, Sargeson edited an anthology of short stories by New Zealand writers, called &quot;Speaking for Ourselves&quot;, published both by Caxton Press in New Zealand and by Reed &amp; Harris in Melbourne, Australia. It received favourable reviews but was not commercially successful.

In 1945, the local council informed Sargeson that the decrepit bach on his family&#x27;s property had to be demolished. Sargeson had little money this time but managed to persuade his father to gift the property to him. It was as part of this legal transfer, in February 1946, that he formally changed his name by deed poll to Frank Sargeson. He no longer qualified for an invalid&#x27;s benefit as his tuberculosis had been cured by antibiotics, but through the intervention of his friends, the government replaced his benefit with a &quot;literary pension&quot;. With these funds, a new bach was built in 1948 by his friend George Haydn, who used the least expensive materials available that complied with the building code.

In 1949, Sargeson published his first full-length novel, &quot;I Saw in My Dream&quot;. The first part of the novel had already been published in &quot;Penguin New Writing&quot; and as a small book by Caxton Press and Reed &amp; Harris. Reviews were unenthusiastic and mixed in both England and New Zealand. In 1953, two of his short stories were included in &quot;World&#x27;s Classics: New Zealand short stories&quot;, edited by Dan Davin for Oxford University Press.

Sargeson continued to nurture and promote New Zealand literary talent, as he had with &quot;Speaking for Ourselves&quot;, most notably by inviting the young author and poet Janet Frame to live in the former army hut on his property in 1955, not long after her discharge from Seacliff Lunatic Asylum. She lived and worked in the army hut from April 1955 to July 1956, producing her first full-length novel &quot;Owls Do Cry&quot; (Pegasus, 1957), which is considered a masterpiece of New Zealand writing. Later, she wrote about this period in her autobiography, &quot;An Angel at my Table&quot;. He was also a friend and mentor to other young writers such as Maurice Duggan and John Reece Cole. Sargeson also extended his friendship to the young architect Renate Prince, who boarded with Sargeson in the former army hut prior to Frame&#x27;s residence.

In 1953, to mark Sargeson&#x27;s fiftieth birthday, &quot;Landfall&quot; published &quot;A Letter to Frank Sargeson&quot;, written and signed by sixteen of his fellow New Zealand writers, including Frame, Duggan, David Ballantyne, Bill Pearson, Helen Lilian Shaw and others. The letter praised Sargeson for his contributions to New Zealand literature, saying that he had &quot;proved that a New Zealander could publish work true to his own country and of a high degree of artistry, and that exile in the cultural centres of the old world was not necessary to this end&quot;, and &quot;revealed that our manners and behaviour formed just as good a basis for enduring literature as those of any other country&quot;. In the editorial to that same issue, Charles Brasch commented that Sargeson&#x27;s birthday was more than a merely personal occasion: &quot;By his courage and his gifts he showed that it was possible to be a writer and contrive to live, somehow, in New Zealand, and all later writers are in his debt.&quot;

At this time it seemed that Sargeson&#x27;s career might be over; his literary output during the 1950s had slowed, with only one novella, two short stories and a short essay, and two partially completed plays. In her autobiography, Frame recalled that in the mid-1950s Sargeson &quot;was often depressed by the general neglect of writers and by the fact that his own books were out of print&quot;.

==Later career==
In the 1960s, Sargeson&#x27;s writing career experienced a renewal, and between 1964 and 1976 he published eleven further books. In 1964, the collection of &quot;Collected Stories, 1935–1963&quot; was published. The two plays he had begun in the 1950s, the comedy &quot;The Cradle and the Egg&quot; and the drama &quot;A Time For Sowing&quot;, were both produced in Auckland in the early 1960s, and published under the title of &quot;Wrestling with the Angel&quot; (1964). &quot;Memoirs of a Peon&quot;, a novel he had completed in the late 1950s but struggled to get published, was finally published in 1965 by a London publisher, and in that same year he won the Bank of New Zealand Katherine Mansfield Memorial Award for the short story &quot;Just Trespassing, Thanks&quot;. Two further novels followed: &quot;The Hangover&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Joy of the Worm&quot; (1969). Unlike his earlier writing, the characters of these three later novels are generally middle-class, and the writing is more fluent and less minimalist, but he retains the themes of isolation and puritanism.

In the 1970s, after the death of his long-time partner Harry Doyle, Sargeson completed a trilogy of autobiographies: &quot;Once is Enough&quot; (1973), &quot;More than Enough&quot; (1975) and &quot;Never Enough&quot; (1977). In 1974 Sargeson received a Scholarship in Letters from the New Zealand Literary Fund and an honorary doctorate of literature from the University of Auckland. In 1981 his autobiographies were published as a single volume, &quot;Sargeson&quot;. He continued to write and publish short fiction until 1980, when his health began to decline.

==Death and legacy==
Sargeson died at North Shore Hospital in Auckland in 1982. A book of his critical writing, &quot;Conversation in a Train&quot;, was published posthumously in 1983.

Sargeson left his estate to his friend Christine Cole Catley who later launched the Frank Sargeson Trust. After his death, the Trust restored his bach and opened it to the public. In 1990, Sargeson&#x27;s ashes were scattered on the property, and a sign was put up outside the bach stating: &quot;Here a truly New Zealand literature had its beginnings&quot;. It is now known as the Frank Sargeson House.

In 1987, the Trust established the Sargeson Fellowship, a New Zealand literary award, to provide assistance to New Zealand writers. Some writers who have received the award include Janet Frame (who was, appropriately, the first writer to receive the award in 1987), Alan Duff and Michael King. From 1987 to 1996 the award was paid for by the Trust, but after funding ran out, law firm Buddle Findlay took over sponsorship from 1997 to 2013 and the fellowship was renamed the Buddle Findlay Sargeson Fellowship. Since 2013, the fellowship has been sponsored by law firm Grimshaw &amp; Co and it is now known as the Grimshaw Sargeson Fellowship.

Since 2003 (the centenary of Sargeson&#x27;s birth), the Frank Sargeson Memorial Lecture has been delivered every year at the University of Waikato by a notable New Zealand writer, and since 2019 the University has sponsored a short story prize, the Sargeson Prize, in his honour.

In 2024, the Alexander Turnbull Library&#x27;s Frank Sargeson Collection, comprising Sargeson&#x27;s draft manuscripts, personal papers and photographs, was inscribed in UNESCO Memory of the World Aotearoa New Zealand Ngā Mahara o te Ao register.

<text>Otto Heinrich Frank (12 May 1889 – 19 August 1980) was the father of Anne Frank. He edited and published the first edition of her diary in 1947 (subsequently known in English as &quot;The Diary of a Young Girl&quot;) and advised on its later theatrical and cinematic adaptations. In the 1950s and the 1960s, he established European charities in his daughter&#x27;s name and founded the trust which preserved his family&#x27;s wartime hiding place, the Anne Frank House, in Amsterdam.

==Early life==
Otto Heinrich Frank was born into a Jewish family. He was the second of four children born to Alice Betty (née Stern, 1865–1953) and Michael Frank (1851–1909). His elder brother was Robert Frank, and younger siblings were Herbert Frank and Helene (Leni) Frank. Otto was a cousin of the furniture designer Jean-Michel Frank and a grandson of Zacharias Frank. His father originally came from Landau, and moved to Frankfurt in 1879, marrying Alice Stern in 1886. Alice and Michael Frank placed value on a middle-class education. Otto had music lessons, learned to ride a horse and visited the theater and opera regularly. The Frank family enjoyed a large circle of friends, and kept a welcoming home. Otto studied economics in Heidelberg from 1908 to 1909 and had a work experience placement at Macy&#x27;s Department Store in New York City thanks to a college friend his age, Nathan Straus Jr. However, after leaving for New York, he had to return home briefly because of his father&#x27;s death in September 1909, before once again leaving for the United States. He returned to Germany two years later in 1911.

==Military service==
Frank served in the Imperial German Army during World War I. He and his two brothers were drafted for military service in August 1915 and after training at a depot in Mainz, he served in an artillery unit on the Western Front in which most soldiers were mathematicians and surveyors. In 1916, he was attached to the infantry as a range-finder at the Battle of the Somme. In 1917, he was promoted in the field to lieutenant and served at the Battle of Cambrai, where two of his French cousins, Oscar and Georges, were killed in action. According to other sources, Otto was late returning home because he was ordered to confiscate two horses from a farmer and returned them to the farmer when the war ended in defeat. He won the Iron Cross for his military service.

==Marriage and children==
Frank worked in the bank that his father initially ran, which subsequently he and his brothers inherited until its collapse in the early 1930s. He married Edith Holländer – an heiress to a scrap-metal and industrial-supply business – on his 36th birthday, 12 May 1925, at the synagogue in Aachen, Edith&#x27;s hometown. Edith was 25 when they married. Their elder daughter, Margot Frank (Margot Betti), was born 16 February 1926, followed by their younger daughter, Anne (Annelies Marie), on 12 June 1929. Edith died of starvation and disease in Auschwitz on 6 January 1945. In late October 1944, Margot and Anne were transferred from Auschwitz to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp where they died of typhus.

In 1953, Frank married Elfriede (Fritzi) Markovits, a Holocaust survivor, who assisted him with the Anne Frank Foundation in Basel, which he launched a decade later. Markovits&#x27;s daughter, Eva Schloss, is a Holocaust survivor, peace activist and international speaker.

==World War II==
As the tide of Nazism rose in Germany and anti-Jewish decrees encouraged attacks on Jewish individuals and families, Otto decided to evacuate his family. In August 1933, they relocated to Aachen, where his mother-in-law, Rosa Holländer resided, in preparation for a subsequent and final move to Amsterdam in the Netherlands. In the same year, Otto&#x27;s widowed mother, Alice Frank, fled to Switzerland.

Otto&#x27;s brother-in-law Erich Elias (the husband of his younger sister Leni and father of Buddy Elias) worked in Basel for Opekta, a company that sold spices and pectin for use in the manufacture of jam. The company was looking to expand its operations in Europe, and Erich arranged for Otto to work as Opekta&#x27;s agent in Amsterdam, allowing Otto to have an income to support his family once they had moved there. Otto and his family lived in Merwedeplein in the modern suburb of Amsterdam-Zuid; they came to know many other German emigrant families. In 1938, Otto Frank started a second company, Pectacon, which was a wholesaler of herbs, pickling salts, and mixed spices, used in the production of sausages. Hermann van Pels was employed by Pectacon as an advisor about spices. A Jewish butcher, he had fled Osnabrück with his family. In 1939, Edith Hollander&#x27;s mother came to live with the Franks and remained with them until her death in January 1942. After Germany invaded the Netherlands in May 1940, Otto Frank was forced by the Germans to give up his companies. Otto made his businesses look &quot;Aryan&quot; by transferring control to his employees.

In 1938 and 1941, Frank attempted to obtain visas for his family to emigrate to the United States or Cuba. He was granted a single visa for himself to Cuba on 1 December 1941, but it is not known if it ever reached him. Ten days later, when Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy declared war on the United States, the visa was canceled. He also attempted to obtain visas for his family to Britain, however, he was never granted the visas.

At the age of 53, when the systematic deportation of Jews from the Netherlands started in the summer of 1942, Otto Frank took his family into hiding on 6 July 1942 in the upper rear rooms of the Opekta premises on the Prinsengracht, behind a concealing bookcase. The day before, his older daughter, Margot, had received a written summons to report for so-called labour duty in Germany, and Otto immediately decided to move the family to safety. They were joined a week later by Hermann van Pels, who was known as Herman van Daan in Anne&#x27;s diary, his wife, Auguste van Pels, and their son, Peter van Pels. In November, the group was joined by Fritz Pfeffer, known in Anne&#x27;s diary as Albert Dussel. Their concealment was aided by Otto Frank&#x27;s colleagues Johannes Kleiman, whom he had known since 1923, Miep Gies, and her husband Jan Gies; Victor Kugler, and Bep Voskuijl.

The group hid for two years, until their discovery in August 1944. It is not known whether an informant or a chance discovery by authorities ended their period of refuge. The group, along with Kugler and Kleiman, were arrested by SS Officer Karl Silberbauer. Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl were not arrested with the group. Miep managed to excuse herself by saying she knew nothing of those in hiding, and Johannes Kleiman managed to excuse Bep Voskuijl from being arrested. These two people would rescue Anne&#x27;s diary before the Nazis cleared out the hiding place.

After being imprisoned in Amsterdam, the Jewish prisoners were sent to the Dutch transit camp of Westerbork and finally, in September, to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where Frank was separated from his wife and daughters. He was sent to the men&#x27;s barracks and was residing in the sick barracks when the camp was liberated by Soviet troops on 27 January 1945. After the liberation of Auschwitz, Otto Frank wrote to his mother in Switzerland, where she had fled in 1933 when Hitler came to power. He travelled back to the Netherlands over the next six months and searched diligently for his family and friends. By the end of 1945, he realized he was the sole survivor of those who had hidden in the house on the Prinsengracht.

==Letter from the Monowai steamship==
==Post-war life==
After Anne Frank&#x27;s death was confirmed in the summer of 1945, her diary and papers were given to Otto Frank by Miep Gies, who had rescued them from the ransacked hiding place together with Bep Voskuijl. As Miep Gies wrote in her book, &quot;Anne Frank Remembered&quot;, Frank immediately started to read the papers. Later he began transcribing them for his relatives in Switzerland. He was persuaded that Anne&#x27;s writing shed light on the experiences of those who suffered persecution under the Nazis and was urged to consider publishing it. He typed out the diary into a single manuscript, editing out sections he thought too personal to his family or too mundane to be of interest to the general reader. The manuscript was read by Dutch historian Jan Romein, who reviewed it on 3 April 1946 for the &quot;Het Parool&quot; newspaper. This attracted the interest of Amsterdam&#x27;s Contact Publishing, which accepted it for publication in the summer of 1946. Otto Frank is now recognized as a co-author of the diary.

On 25 June 1947, the first Dutch edition of the diary was issued under the title &quot;Het Achterhuis&quot; (&quot;The House Behind&quot;). Its success led to an English translation in 1952, which led to a theatrical dramatisation in 1955 and eventually the film &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; (1959), with actor Joseph Schildkraut reprising his role as Otto.
Otto Frank married former Amsterdam neighbor and fellow Auschwitz survivor Elfriede Geiringer (1905–1998) in Amsterdam on 10 November 1953, and the couple moved to Basel, Switzerland, where he had family, including relatives&#x27; children, with whom he shared his experiences. In 1963, he founded the Anne Frank Foundation in Basel (not to be confused with the Anne Frank Foundation in Amsterdam, see below), which is devoted to global distribution and use of the &quot;Diary of Anne Frank&quot;. The non-profit organisation uses the proceeds of the copyrights for charitable purposes, education, and scientific research&quot;.&quot; In addition the Foundation in Basel supports projects in the field of human rights, racism and rights and promoting social justice.

In response to a demolition order placed on the building in which Otto Frank and his family hid during the war, he and Johannes Kleiman helped establish the Anne Frank Foundation in Amsterdam on 3 May 1957, with the principal aim to save and restore the building so it could be opened to the general public. With the aid of public donations, the building and the adjacent one were purchased by the Amsterdam-based foundation. It opened as a museum (the Anne Frank House) on 3 May 1960 and is still in operation.

For the rest of his life, Otto Frank dedicated himself to the publication of the diary and the ideals his daughter had expressed in it. Otto Frank died of lung cancer on 19 August 1980 in Birsfelden and his ashes were buried in the town&#x27;s cemetery, where Elfriede would also be buried, in the same tomb, 18 years later. He was survived by his stepdaughter Eva Schloss, his sister Helene Frank (Edith Frank&#x27;s sister-in-law) and her two children.

Otto Frank designated the Anne Frank Foundation in Basel as his sole heir and legal successor, which means that the copyright on all Anne Frank&#x27;s writings belongs to this organisation.

==Legal fights against Nazi sympathizers==
In the years after the diaries were published, Otto Frank became embroiled in a series of legal battles with individuals who accused him or others of forging the manuscript; these cases would persist even after Frank&#x27;s death in 1980. In 1959, Frank &quot;lodged a criminal complaint on the grounds of libel, slander, defamation, maligning the memory of a deceased person and antisemitic utterances&quot; against two members of the right-wing &quot;Deutsche Reichspartei&quot;, Lothar Stielau and Heinrich Buddeberg, who had dismissed the diary as a work of fiction.

In 1976, Nazi sympathizer Ernst Römer accused Frank of editing and fabricating parts of Anne&#x27;s diary. Frank filed a lawsuit against him. As with the previous case, the court determined that the diary was authentic. Römer demanded a second investigation, but on this occasion the Hamburg District Court engaged the &quot;Bundeskriminalamt (BKA)&quot;. It was claimed that parts of her diary were written with ballpoint pen ink, which did not exist prior to 1951. However, the BKA found that these parts were simply two scraps of paper not attached to the manuscript and clearly written in different handwriting. Some page numbers are presumed to have been added by Otto Frank when compiling the diary for publication. No diary entry is written in ballpoint ink. Reporters were unable to question Frank, as he died around the time of the discovery.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals was awarded between 1966 and 2011 (in its final year, it was awarded for recordings issued in 2010). The award had several minor name changes:

*From 1966 to 1967, the award was known as [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary (R&amp;R) Performance|Best Contemporary (R&amp;R) Performance - Group (Vocal or Instrumental)]]
*In 1968 it was awarded as Best Contemporary Group Performance (Vocal or Instrumental)
*In 1969 it was awarded as Best Contemporary-Pop Performance - Vocal Duo or Group
*In 1970 it was awarded as Best Contemporary Vocal Performance by a Group
*In 1971 it was awarded as Best Contemporary Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus
*In 1972 it was awarded as Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo Or Group
*From 1973 to 1977 it was awarded as Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus

*In 1980 it was again awarded as Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus
*From 1981 to 2011 it was awarded as Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals

The award was discontinued from 2012 in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. From 2012, all duo or group performances in the pop field were shifted to the newly formed [[Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]] category.

A similar award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group was awarded from 1961 to 1968. This was also in the pop field, but did not specify pop music.

Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were presented, for works released in the previous year.

<text>Charlie Dog (also known as Rover, Charlie, and sometimes Charles the Dog) is an animated cartoon character in the Warner Brothers &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series of cartoons. The character was featured in nine cartoons between 1941 and 1958. He is generally characterized as a friendly wise guy.

==Development==
Bob Clampett minted the scenario that Charlie Dog would later inherit in his cartoon short &quot;Porky&#x27;s Pooch&quot;, first released on 27 December 1941. In that cartoon, a homeless hound pulls out all the stops to get adopted by bachelor Porky Pig. Mel Blanc provided the dog&#x27;s gruff, Brooklyn-Bugs Bunny-like voice and accent which became Charlie&#x27;s standard voice. 

==History==
As he did for other &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters, Chuck Jones took Clampett&#x27;s hound and reworked him, with the help of writer Michael Maltese. Jones first used the dog in &quot;Little Orphan Airedale&quot; (4 October 1947) which saw Clampett&#x27;s &quot;Rover&quot; renamed &quot;Charlie.&quot; The film was a success, and Jones would create two more Charlie Dog/Porky Pig cartoons in 1949: &quot;Awful Orphan&quot; (29 January) and &quot;Often an Orphan&quot; (13 August). Jones also starred Charlie without Porky in a couple of shorts: &quot;Dog Gone South&quot; (26 August 1950) which sees Yankee Charlie searching for a fine gentleman of the Southern United States, and &quot;A Hound for Trouble&quot; (28 April 1951) which sends Charlie to Italy where he searches for a master who speaks English. 

In these cartoons, Charlie Dog is defined by one desire: to find himself a master. To this end, Charlie is willing to pull out all the stops, from pulling &quot;the big soulful eyes routine&quot; to boasting of his pedigree (&quot;Fifty percent Collie! Fifty percent setter, Irish Setter! Fifty Percent Boxer! Fifty percent Doberman Pinscher! Fifty percent Pointer—dere it is! Dere it is! Dere it is! But, mostly, I&#x27;m all Labrador Retriever!&quot;); when reminded by others that he is not a Labrador retriever, his response would be, &quot;Look, if you doubt my woid, get me a Labrador and I&#x27;ll retrieve it for you. Dat&#x27;s fair, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; — though in reality, he is just a slick-talking mutt who rarely realizes that his own aggressive obnoxiousness is sabotaging his appeal to any potential guardian. He is called &quot;the most obnoxious salesman on four legs&quot;. He believes that everybody needs a dog to call their own, and he tackles all sorts of schemes to find a home.
Especially in the Porky Pig shorts, the pig would usually try to mail him out of the country, usually accompanied by Porky laughing evilly and maniacally, only to have Charlie return dressed in the costume of that place he was sent, which would make Porky even more determined to get rid of him. 

Charlie has a verbal quirk which recurs. If a word contains another word in full, he will say it like that...vege-TABLE. Immi-GRANT.

Charlie makes a brief cameo appearance (via re-used animation from &quot;Often an Orphan&quot;) in the Bob McKimson-directed short &quot;Dog Tales&quot; (1958). Jones shelved the Charlie Dog series of films in the 1950s, along with characters he had himself introduced, such as The Three Bears and Hubie and Bertie. He was turning his efforts to new characters, such as Pepé Le Pew and Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner.

The Frisky Puppy character that Jones paired with Claude Cat in several &#x27;50s shorts bears a close physical resemblance to Charlie.

==Later appearances==
Recent Warner Brothers merchandising and series and films such as episodes of &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, and &quot;Space Jam&quot; (1996) feature Charlie in the crowd scenes, one in which he throws a basketball to Lola Bunny, &quot;The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries&quot; in the episode &quot;Yelp&quot; (here performed by Joe Alaskey), and &quot;Tweety&#x27;s High-Flying Adventure&quot; (2000) in Italy have brought Charlie back out of retirement. In &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; (2003), he can be spotted playing poker with other Looney Tunes dogs and at the end of the film bringing Bugs a plate of fruit, and in &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot; (2021), he can be seen briefly in Bugs Bunny&#x27;s flashback leaving Tune World way in the front row with other Looney Tunes.

Charlie Dog made a cameo in &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot; episode &quot;Father Figures.&quot; He was seen in a pet store where he was attacked by Henery Hawk (who was looking for a chicken at the time when Porky Pig was being a father figure to him). Charlie Dog appears in &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot; (voiced by Eric Bauza) in the episode &quot;Adopt Me&quot;.

<text>In computing, Interactive System Productivity Facility (ISPF) is a software product for many historic IBM mainframe operating systems and currently the z/OS and z/VM operating systems that run on IBM mainframes. It includes a screen editor, the user interface of which was emulated by some microcomputer editors sold commercially starting in the late 1980s, including SPF/PC.

ISPF primarily provides an IBM 3270 terminal interface with a set of panels. Each panel may include menus and dialogs to run tools on the underlying environment, e.g., Time Sharing Option (TSO). Generally, these panels just provide a convenient interface to do tasks—most of them execute modules of IBM mainframe utility programs to do the actual work. ISPF is frequently used to manipulate z/OS data sets via its Program Development Facility (ISPF/PDF). 

ISPF is user-extensible and it is often used as an application programming interface. Many vendors have created products for z/OS that use the ISPF interface. 

An early version was called Structured Programming Facility (SPF) and introduced in SVS and MVS systems in 1974. IBM chose the name because SPF was introduced about the same time as structured programming concepts. In 1979 IBM introduced a new version and a compatible product for CMS under Virtual Machine Facility/370 Release 5. 

In 1980 IBM changed its name to System Productivity Facility and offered a version for CMS under VM/SP.

In 1982 IBM changed the name to Interactive System Productivity Facility, split off some facilities into Interactive System Productivity Facility/Program Development Facility (ISPF/PDF) and offered a version for VSE/AF.

In 1984 IBM released ISPF Version 2 and ISPF/PDF Version 2; the VM versions allowed the user to select either the PDF editor or XEDIT.

IBM eventually merged PDF back into the base product.

ISPF can also be run from a z/OS batch job.

==ISPF/PDF interactive tools==
When a foreground (interactive) TSO user invokes ISPF, it provides a menuing system, normally with an initial display of a Primary Option Menu this provides them access to many useful tools for application development and for administering the z/OS operating system.

Such tools include
*Browse – for viewing data sets, partitioned data set (PDS) members, and Unix System Services files.
*Edit – for editing data sets, PDS members, and Unix System Services files.
*Utilities – for performing data manipulation operations, such as:
**Data Set List – which allows the user to list and manipulate (copy, move, rename, print, catalog, delete, etc.) files (termed &quot;data sets&quot; in the z/OS environment).
**Member List – for similar manipulations of members of PDSs.
**Search facilities for finding modules or text within members or data sets.
**Compare facilities for comparing members or data sets.
*Library Management, including promoting and demoting program modules.

==ISPF as a user interface development environment==

Underlying ISPF/PDF is an extensive set of tools that allow application developers to create panel-driven applications, and a set of guidelines to promote consistent use of ISPF functions. A &quot;panel&quot; is a character-based &quot;window&quot; which can encompass all or part of a 3270 session&#x27;s screen real estate. See Text-based user interfaces.

Most mainframe software vendors used ISPF functions to create their applications, so their tools are similar in appearance and operation to ISPF. Similarly, many installations write their own informal tools that use ISPF services.

ISPF services are generally available to any programmer in the shop, and can be used to write panels for either personal or shop-wide use, writing in either compiled languages such as HLASM, C, COBOL, PL/I, or interpreted languages such as CLIST, REXX and ooRexx.

ISPF applications can be used to perform so-called &quot;file tailoring&quot; functions, customisation of specially crafted JCL members called &quot;skeletons&quot;, which can then be submitted as batch jobs to the mainframe.

==Editor==

The editor screen is formatted with 2 lines (info &amp; command line) at the top (or bottom – user choice), a six character line number column in the left margin, and the remainder of the screen width being filled with the records of the dataset being edited. Primary commands (which apply to the whole dataset) such as Find, Print, Sort, etc. are typed in the command line. Line commands (which apply only to specific line(s)) such as copy, move, repeat, insert, exclude, delete, text flow, text split are entered by over-typing the line number fields with a one or two character code representing the command to be applied at that line followed by an optional number which further modifies the supplied command.

The editor has several key features:
*Context sensitive color highlighting for several languages and file types
*Code folding via the X or XX...XX(hide) line(s) command &amp; indentation-selective reveals
*editor macro commands in REXX or compiled languages
*comparison with another dataset
*models of ISPF service calls
*context-sensitive Help available 
*recovery from lost sessions

The editor can also be invoked in a &#x27;view&#x27; mode. It behaves like the editor, but does not allow saving the data. Edited files can also be saved under a different name, creating or replacing another file.

ISPF provides the &#x27;editor interface&#x27; which lets an application program display arbitrary data in the familiar editor panel. Thus many vendor packages use this familiar interface.

==Customization ==
ISPF is designed to be customized for each user (a fairly new concept in 1974, when it was introduced). Some of the customization is global and some is specific to an ISPF application.

It supports a set of 24 function keys which, when pressed, execute commands. These are customizable: Each user can replace the default commands assigned to any key with his own preferred command (or series of commands). User settings are stored centrally, so that the user can logon from any terminal and that session will remember their previously-chosen commands for each key. Most personal computers copied this, and have a set of 12 or 24 function keys. Even some defaults have endured: the F1 key triggers a &quot;help&quot; function on a large number of mainframe &amp; PC programs.

ISPF remembers each user&#x27;s choices for such things as screen colors &amp; layout, the location of the command line and scrolling preferences. It also remembers the last-used data set names on each panel, so the next time the panel is used the names are already filled in. This is very convenient for mainframe programmers because they frequently work with the same files repeatedly.

==PC use==
Many of the early users of PCs were mainframe programmers or users, who were accustomed to and liked the ISPF panel system. This led several companies to create partial clones of ISPF that run on DOS, OS/2, Windows or Unix PC systems. In 1984 IBM introduced the EZ-VU dialog manager for DOS PCs, and later OS/2. In 1991 Tritus, Inc introduced Tritus SPF (TSPF), a program to allow use of mainframe ISPF applications and edit macros written in REXX on DOS, OS/2 and Windows; the last release was 1.2.8 in 1994. Freeware ISPF-style editors for Windows include SPF/SE and SPFlite.

In 1994 IBM introduced a built-in downloadable client program called the ISPF Workstation Agent (WSA) that can install and run on OS/2, Windows and selected UNIX workstations; the z/OS version of ISPF only includes WSA for Windows and selected UNIX workstations. WSA communicates directly with ISPF on z/OS and provides a point-and-click graphical user interface automatically.

The ISPF Workstation Agent can be used to edit PC based files from the ISPF editor to take advantage of the editor&#x27;s strengths.

<text>Papilledema or papilloedema is optic disc swelling that is caused by increased intracranial pressure due to any cause. The swelling is usually bilateral and can occur over a period of hours to weeks. Unilateral presentation is extremely rare.

In intracranial hypertension, the optic disc swelling most commonly occurs bilaterally. When papilledema is found on fundoscopy, further evaluation is warranted because vision loss can result if the underlying condition is not treated. Further evaluation with a CT scan or MRI of the brain and/or spine is usually done. Recent research has shown that point-of-care ultrasound can be used to measure optic nerve sheath diameter for detection of increased intracranial pressure and shows good diagnostic test accuracy compared to CT. Thus, if there is a question of papilledema on fundoscopic examination or if the optic disc cannot be adequately visualized, ultrasound can be used to rapidly assess for increased intracranial pressure and help direct further evaluation and intervention. Unilateral papilledema can suggest a disease in the eye itself, such as an optic nerve glioma.

==Signs and symptoms==

Despite being classically referred to as a key symptom of rising intracranial pressure, papilledema is often not present in patients seen in an acute setting such as an emergency room. Many urgent cases of increased ICP only have identifiable papilledema after a day or more.

Early on, papilledema may be discovered on examination with an ophthalmoscope without any changes in patient vision. It can progress to enlargement of the blind spot, blurring of vision, a concentric blind spot pattern, or diplopia (double vision). Ultimately, total loss of vision can occur, as well as other patterns of permanent injury to the optic nerve.

The signs of papilledema that may be seen using an ophthalmoscope include:
* venous engorgement (usually the first signs)
* loss of venous pulsation
* hemorrhages over and/or adjacent to the optic disc
* blurring of optic margins
* elevation of the optic disc
* Paton&#x27;s lines (radial retinal lines cascading from the optic disc)

On visual field examination, the physician may elicit an enlarged blind spot; the visual acuity may remain relatively intact until papilledema is severe or prolonged.

==Causes==
Raised intracranial pressure as a result of one or more of the following:
* Brain tumor, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (also known as &quot;Pseudotumor Cerebri&quot;), cerebral venous sinus thrombosis or intracerebral hemorrhage
* Respiratory failure
* Isotretinoin, which is a powerful derivative of vitamin A, rarely causes papilledema.
* medications like tetracycline
* Hypervitaminosis A, in some people who take megadoses of nutritional supplements and vitamins.
* Hyperammonemia, elevated level of ammonia in blood (including cerebral edema/intracranial pressure)
* Guillain–Barré syndrome, due to elevated protein levels
* POEMS syndrome, a paraneoplastic syndrome that can cause increased intracranial pressure.
* Foster Kennedy syndrome (FKS)
* Chiari malformation
* Tumors of the frontal lobe
* Acute mountain sickness and high-altitude cerebral edema
* Meningitis, leading to increased cranial pressure
* Intracranial aneurysm, or Cerebral aneurysm, which can cause Intracranial hypertension
* Malignant hypertension
* Medulloblastoma
* Obesity
* Orbital
** Glaucoma: central retinal vein occlusion, cavernous sinus thrombosis
** Local lesion: optic neuritis, Ischemic optic neuropathy, methanol poisoning, infiltration of the disc by glioma, sarcoidosis and Lymphoma
* Acute lymphocytic leukemia (caused by infiltration of the retinal vessels by immature leukocytes)
* Long periods of weightlessness (microgravity) (See also visual impairment and intracranial pressure)

==Pathophysiology==
As the optic nerve sheath is continuous with the subarachnoid space of the brain (and is regarded as an extension of the central nervous system), increased pressure is transmitted through to the optic nerve. The brain itself is relatively spared from pathological consequences of high pressure. However, the anterior end of the optic nerve stops abruptly at the eye. Hence the pressure is asymmetrical and this causes a pinching and protrusion of the optic nerve at its head. The fibers of the retinal ganglion cells of the optic disc become engorged and bulge anteriorly. Persistent and extensive optic nerve head swelling, or optic disc edema, can lead to loss of these fibers and permanent visual impairment.

==Diagnosis==
Checking the eyes for signs of papilledema should be carried out whenever there is a clinical suspicion of raised intracranial pressure, and is recommended in newly onset headaches. This may be done by ophthalmoscopy or fundus photography, and possibly slit lamp examination.

It is important to determine whether the observed condition is due to optic nerve head drusen, which can cause an elevation of the optic nerve head that can be mistaken for papilledema. For this reason, optic nerve head drusen is also called pseudopapilledema.

==Treatment==
Historically, papilledema was a potential contraindication to lumbar puncture, as it indicates a risk for tentorial herniation and subsequent death via cerebral herniation, however newer imaging techniques have been more useful at determining when and when not to conduct a lumbar puncture. Imaging by CT or MRI is usually done to find out whether there is a structural cause i.e., tumor. A magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) may also be ordered to rule out the possibility of stenosis or thrombosis of the arterial or venous systems.

The treatment depends largely on the underlying cause. However, the root cause of papilledema is the increased intracranial pressure (ICP). This is a dangerous sign, indicative of a brain tumor, CNS inflammation or idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) that may become manifest in the near future.

Thus, a biopsy is routinely performed prior to the treatment in the initial stages of papilledema to detect whether a brain tumor is present. If detected, laser treatment, radiation and surgeries can be used to treat the tumor.

To decrease ICP, medications can be administered by increasing the absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or decreasing its production. Such medicines include diuretics like acetazolamide and furosemide. These diuretics, along with surgical interventions, can also treat IIH. In IIH, weight loss (even a loss of 10-15%) can lead to normalization of ICP.

Meanwhile, steroids can reduce inflammation (if this is a contributing factor to increased ICP), and may help to prevent vision loss. However, steroids have also been known to cause increased ICP, especially with a change in dosage. However, if a severe inflammatory condition exists, such as multiple sclerosis, steroids with anti-inflammatory effects such as Methylprednisolone and prednisone can help.

Other treatments include repeated lumbar punctures to remove excess spinal fluid in the cranium. The removal of potentially causative medicines including tetracyclines and vitamin A analogues may help decrease ICP; however, this is only necessary if the medication is truly felt to contribute to the ICP increase.

<doc id="199347" wikidata="Q7604532" url="?curid=199347" title="Status message (instant messaging)">
<text>A status message is a function of some instant messaging applications whereby a user may post a message that appears automatically to other users if they attempt to make contact. A status message can tell other contacts the user&#x27;s current status, such as being busy or what the user is currently doing. It is analogous to the voice message in an answering machine or voice mail system. However, status messages may be displayed even if the person is present. They are often updated much more frequently than messages in answering machines, and thus may serve as a means of instant, limited &quot;publication&quot; or indirect communication. Generally, the available status is denoted by a green dot, while the busy status is denoted by a red dot on most of the instant messengers.

Whereas answering machine or voice mail messages often have a generic greeting to leave a message, status messages more often contain a description of where the person is at the moment or what they are doing. Because most instant messaging clients indicate to users when their online contacts are away before they send a message, more often than not away messages are meant to be read in lieu of sending a message, rather than a response. Away messages are not to be confused with &quot;idle messages&quot;, which is an automatic reply to a message when the messaging client has determined that the replier is not at his or her computer.

In the XMPP protocol for instant messaging, the status of a user is signalled by an element called &quot;presence&quot;. This provides a variety of functions, including the option to subscribe to the status so that the recipient is continuously updated with changes in status.

<doc id="199349" wikidata="Q4938170" url="?curid=199349" title="Bohm Dialogue">
<text>Bohm Dialogue (also known as Bohmian Dialogue or &quot;Dialogue in the Spirit of David Bohm&quot;) is a freely flowing group conversation in which participants attempt to reach a common understanding, experiencing everyone&#x27;s point of view fully, equally and nonjudgmentally. This can lead to new and deeper understanding. The purpose is to solve the communication crises that face society, and indeed the whole of human nature and consciousness. It utilizes a theoretical understanding of the way thoughts relate to universal reality. It is named after physicist David Bohm who originally proposed this form of dialogue.

== Bohm&#x27;s original dialogue ==

===The theory of dialogue===

Bohm introduced a concept of dialogue, stating that

dialogue can be considered as a free flow of meaning between people in communication, in the sense of a stream that flows between banks.
These &quot;banks&quot; are understood as representing the various points of view of the participants.

...it may turn out that such a form of free exchange of ideas and information is of fundamental relevance for transforming culture and freeing it of destructive misinformation, so that creativity can be liberated. – David Bohm

A dialogue has no predefined purpose, no , other than that of inquiring into the movement of thought, and exploring the process of &quot;thinking together&quot; collectively. This activity can allow group participants to examine their preconceptions and prejudices, as well as to explore the more general movement of thought. Bohm&#x27;s intention regarding the suggested minimum number of participants was to replicate a social/cultural dynamic (rather than a family dynamic). This form of dialogue seeks to enable an awareness of why communicating in the verbal sphere is so much more difficult and conflict-ridden than in all other areas of human activity and endeavor.

Dialogue should not be confused with discussion or debate, both of which, says Bohm, suggest working towards a goal or reaching a decision, rather than simply exploring and learning. Meeting without an agenda or fixed objective is done to create a &quot;free space&quot; for something new to happen.

David Bohm said:
Dialogue is really aimed at going into the whole thought process and changing the way the thought process occurs collectively. We haven&#x27;t really paid much attention to thought as a process. We have &quot;engaged&quot; in thoughts, but we have only paid attention to the content, not to the process. Why does thought require attention? Everything requires attention, really. If we ran machines without paying attention to them, they would break down. Our thought, too, is a process, and it requires attention, otherwise, it&#x27;s going to go wrong. (Bohm, &quot;On Dialogue&quot;, p. 10.)

Taking reference to the work of Bohm and Peat &quot;Science, Order and Creativity&quot;, Arleta Griffor – noted by Paavo Pylkkänen for her &quot;deep and extensive knowledge of Bohm&#x27;s philosophy&quot; and member of the research group of Bohm&#x27;s collaborator Basil Hiley – underlines the importance of the kind of listening involved in the Bohm dialogue and points to Bohm&#x27;s statement that
[A] thoroughgoing suspension of tacit individual and cultural infrastructures, in the context of full attention to their contents, frees the mind to move in new ways … The mind is then able to respond to creative new perceptions going beyond the particular points of view that have been suspended.
Griffor emphasizes that in conventional discussion,
[T]he self-defensive activity of each participant&#x27;s idiosyncrasy […] prevents listening&quot; and that, in contrast, giving full attention to what the other participants mean can free the mind from socio-cultural accumulation, allow a free flow of meaning between people in a dialogue and give rise to shared perception and the creation of shared meaning in the sense of shared significance, intention, purpose and value.

It seems then that the main trouble is that the other person is the one who is prejudiced and not listening. After all, it is easy for each one of us to see that other people are &#x27;blocked&#x27; about certain questions, so that without being aware of it, they are avoiding the confrontation of contradictions in certain ideas that may be extremely dear to them. The very nature of such a &#x27;block&#x27; is, however, that it is a kind of insensitivity or &#x27;anesthesia&#x27; about one&#x27;s own contradictions. Evidently then, what is crucial is to be aware of the nature of one&#x27;s own &#x27;blocks&#x27;. If one is alert and attentive, he can see for example that whenever certain questions arise, there are fleeting sensations of fear, which push him away from consideration of those questions, and of pleasure, which attract his thoughts and cause them to be occupied with other questions. So, one is able to keep away from whatever it is that he thinks may disturb him. And as a result, he can be subtle at defending his own ideas, when he supposes that he is really listening to what other people have to say. When we come together to talk, or otherwise to act in common, can each one of us be aware of the subtle fear and pleasure sensations that &#x27;block&#x27; the ability to listen freely?

===Principles of dialogue===

#&quot;The group agrees that no group-level decisions will be made in the conversation.&quot; &quot;...In the dialogue group we are not going to decide what to do about anything. This is crucial. Otherwise we are not free. We must have an empty space where we are not obliged to anything, nor to come to any conclusions, nor to say anything or not say anything. It&#x27;s open and free.&quot; (Bohm, &quot;On Dialogue&quot;, pp. 18–19.)&quot;
#&quot;Each individual agrees to suspend judgement in the conversation.&quot; (Specifically, if the individual hears an idea he doesn&#x27;t like, he does not attack that idea.) &quot;...people in any group will bring to it assumptions, and as the group continues meeting, those assumptions will come up. What is called for is to suspend those assumptions, so that you neither carry them out nor suppress them. You don&#x27;t believe them, nor do you disbelieve them; you don&#x27;t judge them as good or bad...(Bohm, &quot;On Dialogue&quot;, p. 22.)&quot;
#&quot;As these individuals &quot;suspend judgement&quot; they also simultaneously are as honest and transparent as possible.&quot; (Specifically, if the individual has a &quot;good idea&quot; that he might otherwise hold back from the group because it is too controversial, he will share that idea in this conversation.)
#&quot;Individuals in the conversation try to build on other individuals&#x27; ideas in the conversation.&quot; (The group often comes up with ideas that are far beyond what any of the individuals thought possible before the conversation began.)

===The experience of a dialogue===

Twenty to forty participants sit in a circle and engage in free-flowing conversation. A dialogue typically goes on for a few hours (or for a few days in a workshop environment).

Participants &quot;suspend&quot; their beliefs, opinions, impulses, and judgments while speaking together, in order to see the movement of the group&#x27;s thought processes and what their effects may be.

In such a dialogue, when one person says something, the other person does not, in general, respond with exactly the same meaning as that seen by the first person. Rather, the meanings are only &quot;similar&quot; and not identical. Thus, when the 2nd person replies, the 1st person sees a &quot;Difference&quot; between what he meant to say and what the other person understood. On considering this difference, he may then be able to see something new, which is relevant both to his own views and to those of the other person. And so it can go back and forth, with the continual emergence of a new content that is common to both participants. Thus, in a dialogue, each person does not attempt to &quot;make common&quot; certain ideas or items of information that are already known to him. Rather, it may be said that two people are making something &quot;in common&quot;, i.e., creating something new together. ((Bohm, &quot;On Dialogue&quot;, p. 3.))

==Post-Bohm==

&quot;Bohm Dialogue&quot; has been widely used in the field of organizational development, and has evolved beyond what David Bohm intended: rarely is the group size as large as what Bohm originally recommended, and there are often other numerous subtle differences. Specifically, any method of conversation that claims to be based on the &quot;principles of dialogue as established by David Bohm&quot; can be considered to be a form of Bohm Dialogue.

Usually, the goal of the various incarnations of &quot;Bohm Dialogue&quot; is to get the whole group to have a better understanding of itself. In other words, Bohm Dialogue is used to inform all of the participants about the current state of the group they are in.

===Incarnations===
* Chris Harris, the thought leader on &quot;Hyperinnovation&quot; (2002) and &quot;Building Innovative Teams&quot; (2003), outlines a multidimensional approach to Dialogue Development, enabling groups to take their collective ideas, knowledge and goals in highly creative, boundary-crossing directions. He says &quot;...it is at the borders between different domains where true creativity, and ultimately innovation occurs ... systems/holistic thinking, mental model sharing/development, and group foresight skills are largely responsible for group communication breakthrough.&quot; &quot;Bohm&quot;, he says, &quot;may have agreed.&quot;
* Peter Senge in his book &quot;The Fifth Discipline&quot; (1990) recommends a type of dialogue that is based on principles he says originate with Bohm, and is part of his strategy to help groups become &quot;learning organizations&quot;.
* Parker Palmer in his book &quot;A Hidden Wholeness&quot; (2004) seems to advocate a style of dialogue that is almost identical to what Bohm originally recommended. (Palmer calls his technique &quot;Circles of Trust&quot;.) Palmer uses his dialogue more for personal spiritual development than for business consultation.
* Holman (1999) explains that Linda Ellinor has used &quot;dialogue like conversation&quot; to establish partnership in the workplace (essentially establishing informal workplace democracy):
&quot;...there is a movement towards what we call shared leadership. Shared leadership refers to what happens as those practicing dialogue over time begin to share in the understanding of collectively held goals and purpose together. Alignment builds. Every individual sees more clearly how he or she uniquely shares and contributes to the output and end results. Formal leaders do not need to direct the activities of subordinates as much. Armed with greater understanding of the larger picture, subordinates simply take independent action when they need to without being dependent on feedback from their manager.&quot; (p. 224)
* William Isaacs (1999) claims to be building directly on Bohm&#x27;s work. He describes many possible techniques and skill sets that can be used to view and enhance dialogue in a group. Isaacs focuses on a four-stage evolutionary-model of a dialogue (pp. 242–290):
Stage one is &quot;Shared Monologues&quot;, where group members get used to talking to each other.

Stage two is &quot;Skillful Discussion&quot;, where people are learning the skills of dialogue.

Stage three is &quot;Reflective Dialogue&quot;, which is approximately Bohm&#x27;s idea of dialogue.

Stage four is &quot;Generative Dialogue&quot;, a special &quot;creative&quot; dialogue Isaacs seeks for his groups.
* Patricia Shaw distances herself from the rest of the Bohm school of dialogue, stating &quot;...I am not trying to foster a special form or discipline of conversation... Rather than inculcating a special discipline of dialogue, I am encouraging perceptions of ensemble improvisation as an organizing craft of communicative action&quot; (Patricia Shaw 2002, p. 164). Shaw&#x27;s form of dialogue focuses on getting group members to appreciate the different roles each other can play in conversation, in the same way that jazz (improvisational) musicians appreciate each other&#x27;s unplanned contribution to a performance. Shaw&#x27;s dialogue variation shows that a simpler, less idealistic approach is possible. For her all conversations are on a continuum, a gray scale that ranges from the highest, purest forms of dialogue to the lowest command-and-control conversations. In this sense dialogue is a property a conversation can have more or less of.

All of the above authors and consultants are considered to be experts in &quot;Bohm Dialogue&quot; (amongst others). This makes Bohm himself only one of many authorities on this subject. Some of these practitioners have made contributions and adaptations completely unforeseen by Bohm himself, making the subject of &quot;Bohm Dialogue&quot; much greater than the dialogue theory Bohm himself originally established, which, Don Factor believes, would have delighted him if he were still alive.

<text>Yahoo! Messenger (sometimes abbreviated Y!M) was an instant messaging client and associated protocol created and formerly operated by Yahoo!. Yahoo! Messenger was provided free of charge and could be downloaded and used with a generic &quot;Yahoo ID&quot;, which also allowed access to other Yahoo! services, such as Yahoo! Mail. 

The service also offered VoIP, file transfers, webcam hosting, a text messaging service, and chat rooms in various categories. In addition to instant messaging features similar to those offered by ICQ, it also offered (on Microsoft Windows) features such as: IMVironments (customizing the look of Instant Message windows, some of which include authorized themes of various cartoons such as &quot;Garfield&quot; or &quot;Dilbert&quot;), address-book integration and Custom Status Messages. It was also the first major IM client to feature BUZZing and music-status.

Yahoo! Messenger dates back to Yahoo! Chat, which was a public chat room service. The actual client, originally called Yahoo! Pager, launched on March 9, 1998 and renamed to Yahoo! Messenger in 1999. Yahoo! Messenger was among the most popular instant messengers during the 2000s. In 2015, a reworked Yahoo! Messenger service was introduced and the legacy version was discontinued in 2016. The new Yahoo! Messenger itself was shut down entirely on July 17, 2018 after less than three years.

== History ==

=== Yahoo! Pager ===
Yahoo! Pager launched on March 9, 1998, an instant messaging (IM) client integrated with Yahoo! services including Yahoo! Chat (more explained in its section below). It included basic messaging support, a buddy list with status message support, the ability to block other users, alerts when a buddies came online, and notifications when a new Yahoo! Mail message arrived. In 2000, the name changed to Yahoo! Messenger.

=== Versions 5 to 8 ===
Version 5.0, released November 2001, introduced IMVironments, an initiative that allowed users to play music and Flash Video clips inside the IM window. Yahoo! partnered with rock band Garbage that provided their single &quot;Androgyny&quot; available to share by users. Other partnerships also made IMVironments for the movie &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, the video game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, and the character Hello Kitty, among others.

In August 2002 with the release of version 5.5, the resolution for video calling was increased to a possible 320x240 and 20 frames per second (up from 160x120 and 1 frame per second). From October 2002, Yahoo! offered for corporate subscribers a more secure and better (SSL) encrypted IM client, called Yahoo! Messenger Enterprise Edition. It was released with a $30 yearly subscription package in 2003.

Yahoo! Messenger version 6.0 was released in May 2004. It added games, music, photos, and Yahoo! Search, alongside a &quot;stealth&quot; mode. It also debuted Yahoo! Avatars. With the release of version 7.0 in August 2005, the client was now renamed to Yahoo! Messenger with Voice. It had several new features such as VoIP, voicemail, drag-and-drop file and photo sharing, Yahoo! 360° and LAUNCHcast integration, and others. It was seen as a challenger against Skype.

On October 12, 2005, Yahoo! and Microsoft formed an alliance in which Yahoo! Messenger and MSN Messenger (later known as Windows Live Messenger) will be interconnected, allowing users of both communities to communicate and share emoticons and buddy lists with each other. The service was enabled on Yahoo! Messenger with Voice 8.0 in July 2006. As of version 8.1, the name switched back to just Yahoo! Messenger.

Beginning in 2006, Yahoo made known its intention to provide a web interface for Yahoo! Messenger, culminating in the Gmail-like web archival and indexing of chat conversations through Yahoo! Mail. However, while Yahoo! Mail integrated much of the rudimentary features of Messenger beginning in 2007, Yahoo did not succeed initially in integrating archival of chat conversations into Mail. Instead, a separate Adobe Flex-based web messenger was released in 2007 with archival of conversations which take place inside the web messenger itself.

=== Web version and later releases ===

At the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2007, Yahoo! Messenger for Vista was introduced, which is a version designed and optimized for Windows Vista. It exploited the new design elements of Vista&#x27;s Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and introduced a new user interface and features. The application was in a preview beta until finally released for download on December 6, 2007. As of October 24, 2008, Yahoo! Messenger for Vista is no longer available.

In May 2007, Yahoo! Messenger for the Web was launched, a browser-based client of the IM service.

Yahoo! Messenger version 9 was released in September 2008. It allows the viewing of YouTube videos within the chat window, and integrates with other Yahoo! services such as Flickr. This version also saw the release of Pingbox, which embeds on a blog or website and allows visitors to send IM texts anonymously without needing Yahoo! Messenger software or to sign in. Version 10, released November 2009, incorporates many bug fixes and features high-quality video calling.

The last major Windows client release, version 11 in 2011, featured integration with Facebook, Twitter and Zynga, allowing chat with Facebook friends and playing Zynga games within. It also archives past messages on an online server which is accessible through the client. Version 11.5 (released November 2011) added tabbed IMs.

=== New Yahoo Messenger ===

In December 2015, an all-new, rewritten Yahoo! Messenger was launched, only on mobile and through a browser. A desktop version of the &quot;new&quot; Messenger was later released, shortly before the &quot;legacy&quot; Messenger shut down on August 5, 2016 and the clients no longer working by August 31, 2016. 

Unable to find success like in the older days, Yahoo! eventually announced that the new Yahoo! Messenger service will shut down on July 18, 2018.

== Mobile versions ==
Mobile versions of Yahoo! Messenger were launched originally for Palm OS and Windows CE devices. In a deal signed March 2000, Yahoo! Messenger would come bundled on Palm handheld computers. It was also available for Verizon Wireless customers, through a deal with Yahoo! announced in March 2001, and through Sprint&#x27;s MiniBrowser. A version for the T-Mobile Sidekick II was released in 2004. This was to be followed by versions for Symbian (via Yahoo! Go), BlackBerry, and then for iPhone in April 2009. A version called Yahoo! Messenger for SMS also existed, which allowed IM via SMS. As of January 2014, the iOS version supported voice calls, with video calling on some devices. The Android version supported &quot;voice &amp; video calls (beta)&quot;.

=== Yahoo! Together ===

Yahoo! Together was a freeware and cross-platform messaging service, developed by Yahoo! for the Android and iOS mobile platforms. The software was introduced in beta on May 8, 2018, as Yahoo! Squirrel to replace Yahoo! Messenger and Verizon Media&#x27;s AOL Instant Messenger. In October 2018, it was renamed to its present name. Yahoo! Together was targeted to families and the consumer market rather than enterprise. The app was compared to Slack. Less than a year after its public beta release, Yahoo! Together went offline on April 4, 2019.

== Group conversations (Yahoo! Chat) ==

Yahoo! Messenger allowed private group conversations. Yahoo! Chat was a free online chat room service provided exclusively for Yahoo! users. Yahoo! Chat was first launched on January 7, 1997. Yahoo! Chat was a separate vertical on Yahoo!. On March 9, 1998, the first public version of Yahoo! Pager was released, with Yahoo! Chat among its features. It allowed users to create public chat rooms, send private messages, and use emoticons.

In its original form, Yahoo! Chat was a user-to-user text chat service used by millions worldwide. Soon after launch, Yahoo! Chat partnered with NBC and NewsCorp to produce moderated Chat Events. Yahoo! Chat events eventually developed broadcast partnerships with 100+ entities and hosted 350+ events-a-month. Yahoo&#x27;s Live Chat with the music group Hanson on July 21, 1998, was the Internet&#x27;s largest live event to date. The blockbusters kept on with events including 3 Beatles (Paul, George, Ringo), a live event from Columbine during the tragedy (in partnership with Time Online), live chats from outer space with John Glenn and many others. Sadly, in one of Yahoo&#x27;s poorer decisions, Yahoo! Chat Events were discontinued in 2001, right at the start of the social media era.

In June 2005, with no advance warning, Yahoo disabled users&#x27; ability to create their own chat rooms. The move came after KPRC-TV in Houston, Texas, reported that many of the user-created rooms were geared toward pedophilia. The story prompted several advertisers, including Pepsi and Georgia-Pacific, to pull their ads from Yahoo.

On November 30, 2012, Yahoo announced that among other changes that the public chat rooms would be discontinued as of December 14, 2012. quoting &quot;This will enable us to refocus our efforts on modernizing our core Yahoo products experiences and of course, create new ones

Yahoo has since closed down the chat.yahoo.com site (first having it redirect visitors to a section of the Yahoo! Messenger page, but as of June 2019 not even resolving that host name anymore) because the great majority of chat users accessed it through Messenger. The company worked for a while on a way to allow users to create their own rooms while providing safeguards against abuse. A greyed-out option to &quot;create a room&quot; was available until the release of version 11.

== Games ==
There were various games and applications available that can be accessed via the conversation window by clicking the games icon and challenging your current contact. It requires Java to function. As of April 18, 2014, games were removed from Yahoo! Messenger.

== Plug-ins ==
In version 8.0, Yahoo! Messenger featured the ability for users to create plug-ins, which are then hosted and showcased on the Yahoo chat room. Yahoo! Messenger users could listen to free and paid Internet radio services, using the defunct Yahoo! Music Radio plug-in from within the messenger window. The plug-in also player functionality, such as play, pause, skip and rate this song.

== Protocol ==
The Yahoo! Messenger Protocol (YMSG) was the client&#x27;s underlying network protocol. It provided a language and series of conventions for software communicating with Yahoo!&#x27;s Instant Messaging service. In essence, YMSG performed the same role for Yahoo!&#x27;s IM as HTTP does for the World Wide Web. Unlike HTTP, however, YMSG was a proprietary protocol, a closed standard aligned only with the Yahoo! messaging service. Rival messaging services have their own protocols, some based on open standards, others proprietary, each effectively fulfilling the same role with different mechanics.

One of the fundamental tenets of instant messaging is the notion that users can see when someone is connected to the network—known in the industry as &#x27;presence&#x27;. The YMSG protocol used the mechanics of a standard internet connection to achieve presence—the same connection it used to send and receive data. In order for each user to remain &#x27;visible&#x27; to other users on the service, and thereby signaling their availability, their Yahoo! IM client software maintained a functional, open, network connection linking the client to Yahoo!&#x27;s IM servers.

=== URI scheme ===
Yahoo! Messenger&#x27;s installation process automatically installed an extra uniform resource identifier (URI) scheme handler for the Yahoo! Messenger Protocol into some web browsers, so that URIs beginning codice_1 could open a new Yahoo! Messenger window with specified parameters. This is similar in function to the mailto URI scheme, which creates a new e-mail message using the system&#x27;s default mail program. For instance, a web page might include a link like the following in its HTML source to open a window for sending a message to the YIM user &quot;exampleuser&quot;:

&lt;a href=&quot;ymsgr:sendim?exampleuser&quot;&gt;Send Message&lt;/a&gt;

To specify a message body, the codice_2 parameter was used, so that the link location might look like this:
ymsgr:sendim?exampleuser&amp;m=This+is+my+message

Other commands were:
* codice_3
* codice_4
* codice_5
* codice_6
* codice_7
* codice_8 – opened the &quot;Send an IM&quot; window
* codice_9 – changed the status message
* codice_10 – loaded an IMVironment (example: codice_11, codice_12)

===Interoperability===
On October 13, 2005, Yahoo and Microsoft announced plans to introduce interoperability between their two messengers, creating the second-largest real-time communications service userbase worldwide: 40 percent of all users. The announcement came after years of third-party interoperability success (most notably, Trillian and Pidgin) and criticisms that the major real-time communications services were locking their networks. Microsoft has also had talks with AOL in an attempt to introduce further interoperability, but AOL was unwilling to participate.

Interoperability between Yahoo and Windows Live Messenger was launched July 12, 2006. This allowed Yahoo and Windows Live Messenger users to chat to each other without the need to create an account on the other service, provided both contacts used the latest versions of the clients. It was not possible to talk using the voice service between the two different messengers.

As of December 14, 2012, the interoperability between Yahoo! Messenger and Windows Live Messenger ceased to exist. The Live Messenger contacts appeared as greyed out and it was not possible to send instant messages to them.

Third-party clients that could access the original service included:
* Adium
* BitlBee
* Centericq
* Empathy
* Fire
* imeem
* IMVU
* Kopete
* meebo
* Meetro
* Miranda NG
* Paltalk
* Pidgin
* Trillian
* Trillian Astra
* Trillian Pro
* Windows Live Messenger
== Reception ==

=== Usage ===
As of August 2000, according to Media Metrix, Yahoo! Messenger had about 10.6 million users in the U.S., about the same as MSN Messenger but trailing AOL Instant Messenger. However another analyst doubted the figures for Yahoo! and MSN.

As of the month of September 2001, over five billion instant messages were sent on the network, up 115% from the year before, according to Media Metrix. Another study in August 2002 showed that it had a 16.7 percent share of IM work and home subscribers in the U.S., compared to 24.1 percent for MSN and 28.3 percent for AIM.

In April 2002, 19.1 million people in the U.S. used Yahoo! Messenger, according to Media Metrix. Another study from Nielsen Net Ratings showed that as of 2002, Yahoo! Messenger had some 12 million users worldwide. This increased to 22 million by March 2006.

Yahoo! Messenger was the dominant instant messaging platform among certain energy traders until the platform was discontinued in August 2016.

At the time of Yahoo! Messenger&#x27;s closure in 2018, it remained popular in Vietnam.

=== Criticism ===

Yahoo! Messenger users were subjected to unsolicited messages (SPIM). Yahoo&#x27;s primary solution to the issue involved deleting such messages and placing the senders on an Ignore List.

, it was estimated that at least 75% of all users who used Yahoo chat rooms were bots. Yahoo introduced a CAPTCHA system to help filter out bots from joining chat rooms, but such systems generally do little to prevent abuse by spammers.

== Security ==
On November 4, 2014, the Electronic Frontier Foundation listed Yahoo! Messenger on its &quot;Secure Messaging Scorecard&quot;. Yahoo! Messenger received 1 out of 7 points on the scorecard. It received a point for encryption during transit, but missed points because communications were not encrypted with a key the provider didn&#x27;t have access to (i.e. the communications were not end-to-end encrypted), users couldn&#x27;t verify contacts&#x27; identities, past messages were not secure if the encryption keys were stolen (i.e. the service did not provide forward secrecy), the code was not open to independent review (i.e. the source code was not open-source), the security design was not properly documented, and there had not been a recent independent security audit.

The British intelligence agency Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)&#x27;s secret mass surveillance program Optic Nerve and National Security Agency (NSA) were reported to be indiscriminately collecting still images from Yahoo webcam streams from millions of mostly innocent Yahoo webcam users from 2008 to 2010, among other things creating a database for facial recognition for future use. Optic Nerve took a still image from the webcam stream every 5 minutes.

In September 2016, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Yahoo&#x27;s security team, led by Alex Stamos, had pressed for Yahoo to adopt end-to-end encryption sometime between 2014 and 2015, but this had been resisted by Jeff Bonforte, Yahoo&#x27;s senior vice president, &quot;because it would have hurt Yahoo&#x27;s ability to index and search message data&quot;.

<doc id="199352" wikidata="Q333991" url="?curid=199352" title="John Taylor, Baron Kilclooney">
<text>John David Taylor, Baron Kilclooney, PC (NI) (born 24 December 1937), is a Northern Irish unionist politician who was deputy leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) from 1995 to 2001, and the Member of Parliament (MP) for Strangford from 1983 to 2001. Lord Kilclooney has sat as a crossbench life peer in the House of Lords since 2001.
He was a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLA) for Strangford from 1998 to 2007.

Kilclooney also served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Northern Ireland from 1979 to 1989.

==Early life==
John Taylor was born in Armagh in County Armagh, Northern Ireland. He was educated at The Royal School, Armagh, and Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree.

==Political career==
Taylor&#x27;s political career began as MP for South Tyrone in the Northern Ireland House of Commons between 1970 and 1972, and he served in the Government of Northern Ireland as Minister of State at the Ministry of Home Affairs.

On 25 February 1972, he survived an assassination attempt in Armagh by the Official Irish Republican Army. Two men, including Joe McCann (who was himself shot dead some months afterwards whilst evading arrest), raked his car with bullets, hitting Taylor five times in the neck and head. Taylor survived, but needed extensive reconstructive surgery on his jaw. Despite this, Taylor soon re-entered politics. He represented Fermanagh &amp; South Tyrone in the short-lived Northern Ireland Assembly elected in 1973 and dissolved in 1974, following the collapse of the power-sharing Executive.

He became a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Northern Ireland in 1979, remaining an MEP until 1989. On 20 January 1987, Taylor left the European Democrats, with whom the Conservatives sat, to join the European Right group.

He was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 1982 for North Down. He then became MP for Strangford in 1983, until 2001. He was a member of Castlereagh Borough Council from 1993 to 1997. In February 1989 he joined the anti-communist Conservative Monday Club and appears on the list of their speakers at the Annual Conference of its Young Members&#x27; Group at the United Oxford &amp; Cambridge Club in Pall Mall, on 18 November 1989, when he spoke on &#x27;The Union and Northern Ireland&#x27;.

Following the 2001 general election, on 17 July he was created a life peer as Baron Kilclooney, &quot;of Armagh in the County of Armagh&quot;, sitting as a crossbencher. He sat on the Northern Ireland Policing Board from 4 November 2001 until 31 March 2006. He continued to sit as a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly until his retirement prior to the elections in March 2007. He remains the only active politician to have participated in all levels of government in Northern Ireland, from local council, the Parliament of Northern Ireland, Westminster, Europe, all previous failed Assemblies and Conventions and the current incarnation of the Assembly.

In January 2012, Lord Kilclooney wrote to &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper asserting that Scotland should be subject to partition, depending on the outcome of the Scottish independence referendum.

==Personal life==
Lord Kilclooney is a member of the Farmers Club in London, and the County Club in Armagh City.

He owns Alpha Newspapers, which operates local newspaper titles in Northern Ireland and the Republic.

He married Mary Todd in 1970, and has six children. His wife died in September 2023.

==Controversies==

In 1988, the then John Taylor replied to a letter from Gearoid Ó Muilleoir, deputy president of the Student&#x27;s Union in Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, relating to grants for students in Northern Ireland. Taylor&#x27;s letter said, &quot;Since your surname is clearly unpronounceable I have, rightly or wrongly, concluded that you are Irish and not British. I therefore suggest that you, and those whom you represent, apply for any necessary grants to the Dublin Government.&quot;

Taylor aroused controversy for comments regarding the 1992 murder of five Catholic men and boys by the Ulster Defence Association: &quot;...and it is pointed out that the murder of Roman Catholics at Sean Graham&#x27;s on the Ormeau Road encouraged the Catholic community to publicly condemn the IRA and to point out that these innocent Catholics would not have been murdered had the IRA not firstly committed the terrible slaughter of eight Protestants at Teebane.&quot;

In September 1993, Taylor described Loyalist paramilitary victims (overwhelmingly Catholic civilians) &quot;generally&quot; as &quot;members of organisations which support the IRA&quot;. Earlier that same month he also said the increasing fear amongst Catholics might be helpful because they were beginning to &quot;appreciate&quot; the fear in the Protestant community.

Taylor later repudiated being Irish in a debate in Dublin: &quot;We in Northern Ireland are not Irish. We do not jig at crossroads, speak Gaelic, play GAA etc… It is an insult for Dubliners to refer to us as being Irish.&quot;

In 1997, British Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a statement on the Irish Famine, in which he said &quot;those governed in London at the time failed their people through standing by while a crop failure turned into a massive human tragedy. We must not forget such a dreadful event.&quot; Taylor said, &quot;I suppose it is a nice gesture by the prime minister but he will find it will not satisfy and there will be yet more demands. The Irish mentality is one of victimhood - they ask for one apology one week and another on a different subject the next.&quot;

In 2013, he attended the annual conference of the far-right Traditional Britain Group.

In November 2017, Taylor attracted criticism for describing the then-Taoiseach of the Republic of Ireland Leo Varadkar as &quot;the Indian&quot;. Taylor withdrew his comment, stating that he had forgotten how to spell the Irish head of government&#x27;s name, despite spelling it in an earlier tweet. Despite this contrition, in May 2018 Taylor once again referred to Varadkar as a &quot;typical Indian&quot; following Varadkar&#x27;s visit to Northern Ireland. This time Taylor stood by his comment, stating that the Taoiseach had &quot;upset Unionists&quot; with his visit, but reiterated that he was not a racist.

In April 2018, Taylor faced calls to apologise after claiming McGurk&#x27;s Bar, bombed by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) in 1971, was a &quot;drinking hole for IRA sympathisers&quot; who had run a &quot;political campaign to place the blame on the UVF&quot;. The UVF attack, which killed 15 people, was one of the deadliest incidents in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Taylor, who was a Stormont minister at the time of the bombing, wrongly claimed the massacre was an IRA device that exploded prematurely inside the premises. Pat Irvine, who was aged 14 when her mother Kathleen was killed in the attack, said &quot;I&#x27;m actually disgusted with him, that he&#x27;s so blatant with his hatred and bitterness.&quot;

On 9 November 2020, Taylor made a series of statements on Twitter about American Vice-President-Elect Kamala Harris, saying, &quot;What happens if Biden moves on and the Indian becomes President. Who then becomes Vice President?&quot; When challenged, he claimed that he did not know the name of the vice-president elect, by way of explaining his term of reference. He said, &quot;I had never heard of her nor knew her name is Harris. India is quite rightly celebrating that an Indian, who has USA citizenship, has been appointed Vice President elect&quot;.

Taylor had previously been labelled an &quot;old racist dinosaur&quot; by Piers Morgan, for comments he had made in 2017 about cricketer Moeen Ali. Taylor had said on Twitter that, &quot;Times have changed! The England team now needs non English people in order to win Test Games&quot;. When it was pointed out that Ali was born in Britain, Taylor responded, &quot;Moeen Ali is proud to be British but racially he is not English. There is a difference between being English and being British!!&quot;, adding that, &quot;A Chinese born in England is Chinese and not English!&quot;.

In July 2021, During the Euro 2021 football competition, Taylor posted remarks on Twitter criticising the Spain national football team for not singing their national anthem at the start of football matches. Commentators responded by pointing out that the Spanish national anthem does not, in fact, have any lyrics.

<doc id="199353" wikidata="Q36931" url="?curid=199353" title="Ubykh language">
<text>Ubykh is an extinct Northwest Caucasian language once spoken by the Ubykh people, an ethnic group of Circassian nation who originally inhabited the eastern coast of the Black Sea before being deported &quot;en masse&quot; to the Ottoman Empire in the Circassian genocide.

The Ubykh language is ergative and polysynthetic, with a high degree of agglutination, with polypersonal verbal agreement and a very large number of distinct consonants but only two phonemically distinct vowels. With around eighty consonants, it has one of the largest inventories of consonants in the world, and the largest number for any language without clicks. 

The name Ubykh is derived from (), from , its name in the Adyghe language. It is known in linguistic literature by many names: variants of Ubykh, such as &quot;Ubikh&quot;, (French); and its Germanised variant (from Ubykh ).

==Major features==
Ubykh is distinguished by the following features, some of which are shared with other Northwest Caucasian languages:

* It is ergative, making no syntactic distinction between the subject of an intransitive sentence and the direct object of a transitive sentence. Split ergativity plays only a small part, if at all.
* It is highly agglutinating and polysynthetic, using mainly monosyllabic or bisyllabic roots, but with single morphological words sometimes reaching nine or more syllables in length: (&#x27;if only you had not been able to make him take [it] all out from under me again for them&#x27;). Affixes rarely fuse in any way.
* It has a simple nominal system, contrasting just three noun cases, and not always marking grammatical number in the direct case.
* Its system of verbal agreement is quite complex. English verbs must agree only with the subject; Ubykh verbs must agree with the subject, the direct object and the indirect object, and benefactive objects must also be marked in the verb.
* It is phonologically complex as well, with 84 distinct consonants (four of which, however, appear only in loan words). It has three phonemic vowels [ɐ ɜ ɨ] which correspond to Dumézil&#x27;s [aa a ə] respectively and this is evident in the minimal triplet of /ɐsʃɨn/ (&#x27;I milk X&#x27;), /ɐsʃɜn/ (&#x27;I reap X&#x27;), and /ɐsʃɐn/ (&#x27;I milk them; I reap them&#x27;).

== Phonology ==

Ubykh has 84 phonemic consonants, a record high amongst languages without click consonants, but only 3 phonemic vowels. Four of these consonants are found only in loanwords and onomatopoeiae. There are nine basic places of articulation for the consonants and extensive use of secondary articulation, such that Ubykh has 20 different uvular phonemes. Ubykh distinguishes three types of postalveolar consonants: apical, laminal, and laminal closed. Regarding the vowels, since there are only three phonemic vowels, there is a great deal of allophony.

==Grammar==
=== Morphosyntax ===

Ubykh is agglutinative and polysynthetic: (&#x27;we will not be able to go back&#x27;), (&#x27;if you had said it&#x27;). It is often extremely concise in its word forms.

The boundaries between nouns and verbs is somewhat blurred. Any noun can be used as the root of a stative verb ( &#x27;child&#x27;, &#x27;I was a child&#x27;), and many verb roots can become nouns simply by the use of noun affixes ( &#x27;to say&#x27;, &#x27;what I say&#x27;).

==== Nouns ====
The noun system in Ubykh is quite simple. It has three main noun cases (the oblique-ergative case may be two homophonous cases with differing function, thus presenting four cases in total):
* direct or absolutive case, marked with the bare root; this indicates the subject of an intransitive sentence and the direct object of a transitive sentence (e.g. &#x27;a man&#x27;)
* oblique-ergative case, marked in -; this indicates either the subject of a transitive sentence, targets of preverbs, or indirect objects which do not take any other suffixes ( &#x27;(to) a child&#x27;)
* locative case, marked in -, which is the equivalent of English &quot;in&quot;, &quot;on&quot; or &quot;at&quot;.
There are X other cases that exist in Ubykh too:

* instrumental case (-) was also treated as a case in Dumézil (1975). 
* instrumental-comitative case (-).
* Another pair of postpositions, - (&#x27;to[wards]&#x27;) and - (&#x27;for&#x27;), have been noted as synthetic datives (e.g. &#x27;I will send it to the prince&#x27;), but their status as cases is also best discounted.

Nouns do not distinguish grammatical gender. The definite article is (e.g. &#x27;the man&#x27;). There is no indefinite article directly equivalent to the English &quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot;, but -(root)- (literally &#x27;one&#x27;-(root)-&#x27;certain&#x27;) translates French &quot;un&quot; : e.g. (&#x27;a certain young man&#x27;).

Number is only marked on the noun in the ergative case, with -. The number marking of the absolutive argument is either by suppletive verb roots (e.g. &#x27;he is in the car&#x27; vs. &#x27;they are in the car&#x27;) or by verb suffixes: (&#x27;he goes&#x27;), (&#x27;they go&#x27;). The second person plural prefix - triggers this plural suffix regardless of whether that prefix represents the ergative, the absolutive, or an oblique argument: 
*Absolutive: (&#x27;I give you all to him&#x27;)
*Oblique: (&#x27;he gives me to you all&#x27;)
*Ergative: (&#x27;you all give it/them to me&#x27;)
Note that, in this last sentence, the plurality of &quot;it&quot; (-) is obscured; the meaning can be either &#x27;You all give &quot;it&quot; to me&#x27; or &#x27;You all give &quot;them&quot; to me&#x27;.

Adjectives, in most cases, are simply suffixed to the noun: (&#x27;pepper&#x27;) with (&#x27;red&#x27;) becomes (&#x27;red pepper&#x27;). Adjectives do not decline.

Postpositions are rare; most locative semantic functions, as well as some non-local ones, are provided with preverbal elements: (&#x27;you wrote it for me&#x27;). However, there are a few postpositions: (&#x27;like me&#x27;), (&#x27;near the prince&#x27;).

==== Pronouns ====
Free pronouns in all North-West Caucasian languages lack an ergative-absolutive distinction.
===== Possession =====

Possessed nouns have their plurality marked with the affix .

==== Verbs ====

A pastpresentfuture distinction of verb tense exists (the suffixes - and - represent past and future) and an imperfective aspect suffix is also found (-, which can combine with tense suffixes). Dynamic and stative verbs are contrasted, as in Arabic, and verbs have several nominal forms. Morphological causatives are not uncommon. The conjunctions (&#x27;and&#x27;) and (&#x27;but&#x27;) are usually given with verb suffixes, but there is also a free particle corresponding to each:
*- &#x27;and&#x27; (free particle , borrowed from Arabic);
*- &#x27;but&#x27; (free particle )

Pronominal benefactives are also part of the verbal complex, marked with the preverb -, but a benefactive cannot normally appear on a verb that has three agreement prefixes already.

Gender only appears as part of the second person paradigm, and then only at the speaker&#x27;s discretion. The feminine second person index is -, which behaves like other pronominal prefixes: (&#x27;he gives [it] to you [normal; gender-neutral] for me&#x27;), but compare &#x27;he gives [it] to you [feminine] for me&#x27;).

===== Agreement =====
Oblique 1 markers are limited to marking the agreement of a noun before a relational preverb and Oblique 2 markers are used for not only marking agreement with local and directional preverbs but also the simple oblique, or dative, arguments. 

The second-person is an archaic pronoun used to indicate that the person being referred to is a female, or heckling the speaker in some way.

===== Dynamic verb conjugation =====
Dynamic Ubykh verbs are split up in two groups: Group I which contain the simple tenses and Group II which contain derived counterpart tenses. Only the Karaclar dialect uses the progressive tense and the plural is unknown.

The singular-plural distinction is used when the subject, the ergative, is singular or plural.

Square brackets indicate elided vowels; parenthesis indicate optional parts of the stem; and the colon indicates the boundary of a morpheme. 

====== Simple past ======
The verbs in the simple past tense are conjugated with - in the singular and - in the plural.

Examples:

* - to say → (s)he said
* - to eat → (s)he ate
* - to know → (s)he knew
* - to go → (s)he went

====== Mirative past ======
The verbs in the mirative past tense are conjugated with - in the singular and - in the plural.

Examples:

* - to say → (s)he said apparently
* - to eat → (s)he ate apparently
* - to know → (s)he knew apparently
* - to go → (s)he went apparently

====== Present ======
The verbs in the present tense are conjugated with - in the singular and - in the plural.

Examples:

* - to say → (s)he says
* - to eat → (s)he eats
* - to know → (s)he knows 
* - to go → (s)he goes

====== Future I ======
The verbs in the present tense are conjugated with - in the singular and - in the plural. It conveys a sense of certainty, immediacy, obligation, or intentionality.

Examples:

* - to say → (s)he certainly will say
* - to eat → (s)he certainly will eat
* - to know → (s)he certainly will know 
* - to go → (s)he certainly will go

====== Future II ======
The verbs in the present tense are conjugated with - in the singular and - in the plural. It conveys a generic sense of the future as well as an exhortative sense such as: (let&#x27;s go!).

Examples:

* - to say → (s)he will say
* - to eat → (s)he will eat
* - to know → (s)he will know 
* - to go → (s)he will go

===== Static verb conjugation =====
In all dialects and speakers, only two static tenses exist: present and past.
===== Aspect =====
There are five basic aspects that exist besides the aspects that exist within the Ubykh tense system. They are: habitual, iterative, exhaustive, excessive, and potential.

A speaker may combine one of these aspects with another to convey more complex aspects in conjunction with the tenses. 
A few meanings covered in English by adverbs or auxiliary verbs are given in Ubykh by verb suffixes:
* (&#x27;I can eat it&#x27;) - (&#x27;I can drink it&#x27;)
* (&#x27;I eat it all the time&#x27;) - (&#x27;I drink it all the time&#x27;)
* (&#x27;I am eating it all up&#x27;) - (&#x27;I am drinking it all up&#x27;)
* (&#x27;I eat it too much&#x27;) - (&#x27;I drink it too much&#x27;)
* (&#x27;I eat it again&#x27;) - (&#x27;I drink it again&#x27;)

==== Questions ====
Questions may be marked grammatically, using verb suffixes or prefixes:

*Yesno questions with -: ? (&#x27;did you see that?&#x27;)
*Complex questions with -: ? (&#x27;what is your name?&#x27;)

Other types of questions, involving the pronouns &#x27;where&#x27; and &#x27;what&#x27;, may also be marked only in the verbal complex: (&#x27;where are you going?&#x27;), (&#x27;what had you said?&#x27;).

==== Preverbs and determinants ====
Many local, prepositional, and other functions are provided by preverbal elements providing a large series of applicatives, and here Ubykh shows remarkable complexity. Two main types of preverbal elements exist: determinants and preverbs. The number of preverbs is limited, and mainly show location and direction. The number of determinants is also limited, but the class is more open; some determinant prefixes include - (&#x27;with regard to a horse&#x27;) and - (&#x27;with regard to the foot or base of an object&#x27;).

For simple locations, there are a number of possibilities that can be encoded with preverbs, including (but not limited to):
* above and touching
* above and not touching
* below and touching
* below and not touching
* at the side of
* through a space
* through solid matter
* on a flat horizontal surface
* on a non-horizontal or vertical surface
* in a homogeneous mass
* towards
* in an upward direction
* in a downward direction
* into a tubular space
* into an enclosed space
There is also a separate directional preverb meaning &#x27;towards the speaker&#x27;: -, which occupies a separate slot in the verbal complex. However, preverbs can have meanings that would take up entire phrases in English. The preverb - signifies &#x27;on the earth&#x27; or &#x27;in the earth&#x27;, for instance: (&#x27;they buried his body&#x27;; literally, &quot;they put his body in the earth&quot;). Even more narrowly, the preverb - signifies that an action is done out of, into or with regard to a fire: (&#x27;I take a brand out of the fire&#x27;).

== Orthography ==
Writing systems for the Ubykh language have been proposed, but there has never been a standard written form. However, Fenwick gives a guide for their &quot;practical Ubykh orthography&quot;, intended to be typeable on a Turkish computer keyboard, which is shown below:
== Lexicon ==
=== Native vocabulary ===
Ubykh syllables have a strong tendency to be CV, although VC and CVC also exist. Consonant clusters are not as large as in Abzhywa Abkhaz or in Georgian, rarely being larger than two terms. Three-term clusters exist in two words - () and (), but the latter is a loan from Adyghe, and the former more often pronounced when it appears alone.
Compounding plays a large part in Ubykh and, indeed, in all Northwest Caucasian semantics. For instance, the verb &quot;to love&quot; is expressed as (), as in .

Reduplication occurs in some roots, often those with onomatopoeic values (, from ; , [a loan from Adyghe]); and , ).

Roots and affixes can be as small as one phoneme. The word , , for instance, contains six phonemes, each a separate morpheme:

* - 2nd singular absolutive
* - 3rd singular dative
* - 3rd ergative
* - to give 
* - ergative plural
* - present tense

However, some words may be as long as seven syllables (although these are usually compounds): ().

=== Slang and idioms ===
As with all other languages, Ubykh is replete with idioms. The word (&#x27;door&#x27;), for instance, is an idiom meaning either &quot;magistrate&quot;, &quot;court&quot;, or &quot;government.&quot; However, idiomatic constructions are even more common in Ubykh than in most other languages; the representation of abstract ideas with series of concrete elements is a characteristic of the Northwest Caucasian family. As mentioned above, the phrase meaning &quot;You loved him&quot; translates literally as &#x27;You saw him well&#x27;; similarly, &quot;she pleased you&quot; is literally &#x27;she cut your heart&#x27;. The term (&#x27;Russian&#x27;), an Arabic loan, has come to be a slang term meaning &quot;infidel&quot;, &quot;non-Muslim&quot; or &quot;enemy&quot; (see History below).

=== Foreign loans ===
The majority of loanwords in Ubykh are derived from either Adyghe or Arabic, with smaller numbers from Persian, Abkhaz, and the South Caucasian languages. Towards the end of Ubykh&#x27;s life, a large influx of Adyghe words was noted; Vogt (1963) notes a few hundred examples. The phonemes were borrowed from Arabic and Adyghe. also appears to come from Adyghe, although it seems to have arrived earlier on. It is possible, too, that is a loan from Adyghe, since most of the few words with this phoneme are obvious Adyghe loans: (&#x27;proud&#x27;), (&#x27;testis&#x27;).

Many loanwords have Ubykh equivalents, but were dwindling in usage under the influence of Arabic, Circassian, and Russian equivalents:
* (&#x27;to make a hole in, to perforate&#x27; from Iranic languages) = 
* (&#x27;tea&#x27; from Chinese) = 
* (&#x27;enemy&#x27; from Persian) = 

Some words, usually much older ones, are borrowed from less influential stock: Colarusso (1994) sees (&#x27;pig&#x27;) as a borrowing from a proto-Semitic *&quot;huka&quot;, and (&#x27;slave&#x27;) from an Iranian root; however, Chirikba (1986) regards the latter as being of Abkhaz origin ( ← Abkhaz &quot;agər-wa&quot; &#x27;lower cast of peasants; slave&#x27;, literally &#x27;Megrelian&#x27;).

== Evolution ==

In the scheme of Northwest Caucasian evolution, despite its parallels with Adyghe and Abkhaz, Ubykh forms a separate third branch of the family. It has fossilised palatal class markers where all other Northwest Caucasian languages preserve traces of an original labial class: the Ubykh word for &#x27;heart&#x27;, , corresponds to the reflex in Abkhaz, Abaza, Adyghe, and Kabardian. Ubykh also possesses groups of pharyngealised consonants. All other NWC languages possess true pharyngeal consonants, but Ubykh is the only language to use pharyngealisation as a feature of secondary articulation.

With regard to the other languages of the family, Ubykh is closer to Adyghe and Kabardian but shares many features with Abkhaz due to geographic influence; many later Ubykh speakers were bilingual in Ubykh and Adyghe.

=== Dialects ===
While not many dialects of Ubykh existed, one divergent dialect of Ubykh has been noted (in Dumézil 1965:266-269). Grammatically, it is similar to standard Ubykh (i.e. Tevfik Esenç&#x27;s dialect), but has a very different sound system, which had collapsed into just 62-odd phonemes:
* have collapsed into .
* are indistinguishable from .
* seems to have disappeared.
* Pharyngealisation is no longer distinctive, having been replaced in many cases by geminate consonants.
* Palatalisation of the uvular consonants is no longer phonemic.

== History ==
Ubykh was spoken in the eastern coast of the Black Sea around Sochi until 1864, when the Ubykhs were driven out of the region by the Russians. They eventually came to settle in Turkey, founding the villages of Hacı Osman, Kırkpınar, Masukiye and Hacı Yakup. Arabic and Circassian eventually became the preferred languages for everyday communication, and many words from these languages entered Ubykh in that period.

The Ubykh language died out on 7 October 1992, when its last fluent speaker, Tevfik Esenç, died. Before his death, thousands of pages of material and many audio recordings had been collected and collated by a number of linguists, including Georges Charachidzé, Georges Dumézil, Hans Vogt, George Hewitt and A. Sumru Özsoy, with the help of some of its last speakers, particularly Tevfik Esenç and Huseyin Kozan. Ubykh was never written by its speech community, but a few phrases were transcribed by Evliya Çelebi in his Seyahatname and a substantial portion of the oral literature, along with some cycles of the Nart saga, was transcribed. Tevfik Esenç also eventually learned to write Ubykh in the transcription that Dumézil devised.

Julius von Mészáros, a Hungarian linguist, visited Turkey in 1930 and took down some notes on Ubykh. His work &quot;Die Päkhy-Sprache&quot; was extensive and accurate to the extent allowed by his transcription system (which could not represent all the phonemes of Ubykh) and marked the foundation of Ubykh linguistics.

The Frenchman Georges Dumézil also visited Turkey in 1930 to record some Ubykh and would eventually become the most celebrated Ubykh linguist. He published a collection of Ubykh folktales in the late 1950s, and the language soon attracted the attention of linguists for its small number of phonemic vowels. Hans Vogt, a Norwegian, produced a monumental dictionary that, in spite of its many errors (later corrected by Dumézil), is still one of the masterpieces and essential tools of Ubykh linguistics.

Later in the 1960s and into the early 1970s, Dumézil published a series of papers on Ubykh etymology in particular and Northwest Caucasian etymology in general. Dumézil&#x27;s book &quot;Le Verbe Oubykh&quot; (1975), a comprehensive account of the verbal and nominal morphology of the language, is another cornerstone of Ubykh linguistics.

Since the 1980s, Ubykh linguistics has slowed drastically with the most recent treatise being Fenwick&#x27;s &quot;A Grammar of Ubykh&quot; (2011), who was also working on a dictionary. The Ubykh themselves have shown interest in relearning their language.

The Abkhaz writer Bagrat Shinkuba&#x27;s historical novel Bagrat Shinkuba. &quot;The Last of the Departed&quot; treats the fate of the Ubykh people.

People who have published literature on Ubykh include
* Brian George Hewitt
* Georges Dumézil
* Hans Vogt
* John Colarusso
* Tevfik Esenç
* Viacheslav Chirikba

===Notable characteristics===
Ubykh had been cited in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; (1996 ed.) as the language with the most consonant phonemes, but since 2017 the !Xóõ language (a member of the Tuu languages) has been considered by the book to have broken that record, with 130 consonants. Ubykh has 20 uvular and 29 pure fricative phonemes, more than any other known language.

===Samples===
All examples from Dumézil 1968 and retranscribed by Fenwick.











====Free English translation====
Once, a sheep and a goat went into the field to go grazing. Where they went to graze, they came upon a gully, and the sheep, who was in front, jumped over it. When the sheep jumped, its tail flew up. The goat, who had been following behind it, began to laugh.

&quot;What are you laughing for?&quot; the sheep asked the goat. &quot;I saw your arse, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m laughing about,&quot; said the goat. The sheep turned to the goat and said, &quot;your arse is out in the open every day without you knowing it. And you laugh because you saw mine once.&quot;

*Notes
== Notes ==

: Fenwick lists a plural form for (&#x27;to give&#x27;) but it is never used in the grammar even when a plural form is expected.

<text>Barbara Gowdy, CM (born 25 June 1950) is a Canadian novelist and short story writer. Born in Windsor, Ontario, she is the long-time partner of poet Christopher Dewdney and resides in Toronto.

==Literary career==

Gowdy&#x27;s novel &quot;Falling Angels&quot; (1989) was made into a film of the same name by director Scott Smith, from an adaptation written by Esta Spalding, in 2002. The novel focuses on a nuclear family in a 1960s Ontario suburb. The main characters are three sisters who come of age in a house run by their abusive and womanizing father and must constantly find ways to take care of their depressed and alcoholic mother. Gowdy says her inspiration for the book was the idea of a Canadian family living during the Cold War and practicing using their bomb shelter in the back yard. In the novel and movie, the family spend two weeks trapped in the bomb shelter as an &quot;exercise&quot; rather than going on a family trip to Disneyland.

The narrator and main character of the title short story of her 1992 collection, &quot;We So Seldom Look On Love&quot; is an assistant embalmer at a funeral home who has sex with the corpses of attractive young men before they are buried. The story was the inspiration for the 1996 Canadian independent film &quot;Kissed&quot;, directed by Lynne Stopkewich and starring Molly Parker. The story&#x27;s name is taken from a line in Frank O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s poem &quot;Ode on Necrophilia&quot;, and was inspired by a newspaper article Gowdy read about Karen Greenlee, a young California woman who hijacked a hearse on its way to a funeral, took the corpse of the young man inside the coffin to a motel room and had sex with it for several days before being caught by the police. The story collection follows outsiders trying to find their place in the world. &quot;The Two-Headed Man&quot; features a man who removes his conjoined head and, therefore, either commits murder or suicide. &quot;93 Million Miles Away&quot; involves a woman who, in a desperate need to be seen and known, exposes herself through the window of her apartment to the doctor in an apartment across the lane. This story was made into the film &quot;Arousal&quot;.

Gowdy&#x27;s novel &quot;Mister Sandman&quot; revolves around the family of Joan, a young autistic girl with a savant talent for playing classical music on the piano. Her novel &quot;The White Bone&quot; is written from the perspective of African elephants. Subsequent novels &quot;The Romantic&quot; and &quot;Helpless&quot; focus on characters driven to extreme action by the force of their desires.

She wrote the short film screenplay &quot;Green Door&quot;, which was directed by Semi Chellas and released in 2008.

She released a novel, &quot;Little Sister&quot;, in 2017, about a woman who is able to inhabit the body of another woman and see life through the other woman&#x27;s eyes.

==Recognition==

Gowdy has been nominated, repeatedly, for every major Canadian book prize, including the Giller Prize (twice short-listed, once long-listed); the Governor General&#x27;s Award (three-times short-listed); and the Rogers Writers&#x27; Trust Fiction Prize (twice-shorted listed). &quot;The Romantic&quot; was nominated for the Man Booker Prize. &quot;Helpless&quot; won the Trillium Book Award. All her books are bestsellers in Canada and Germany. Carol Shields claimed in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; that Gowdy &quot;writes like an angel.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; has called her &quot;a miraculous writer.&quot; And &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; says, &quot;Gowdy&#x27;s is a peacemaking genius, unique in its talent for the translation of strangeness to second nature...&quot;

She was appointed a member of the Order of Canada effective 5 October 2006. In 2012, she won a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship for her work.

==Controversy==
In June 2008, Gowdy&#x27;s 2007 novel &quot;Helpless&quot;, which follows the stalking and kidnap of a nine-year-old girl, was abridged and adapted for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Book at Bedtime&quot;. This resulted in several listeners complaining that the novel was &#x27;dark&#x27;, &#x27;disturbing&#x27; and had &#x27;(frightened) the life out of them&#x27;. Commissioning editor Caroline Raphael defended the BBC&#x27;s choice stating &quot;It is about a very difficult subject ... Unfortunately, writers do want to write about disturbing things&quot; she also added unhappy listeners could simply &quot;turn off&quot;.

<doc id="199358" wikidata="Q134316" url="?curid=199358" title="Adposition">
<text>Adpositions are a class of words used to express spatial or temporal relations (&quot;in, under, towards, behind, ago&quot;, etc.) or mark various semantic roles (&quot;of, for&quot;). The most common adpositions are prepositions (which precede their complement) and postpositions (which follow their complement).

An adposition typically combines with a noun phrase, this being called its complement, or sometimes object. English generally has prepositions rather than postpositions – words such as &quot;in, under&quot; and &quot;of&quot; precede their objects, such as &quot;in England&quot;, &quot;under the table&quot;, &quot;of Jane&quot; – although there are a few exceptions including &quot;ago&quot; and &quot;notwithstanding&quot;, as in &quot;three days ago&quot; and &quot;financial limitations notwithstanding&quot;. Some languages that use a different word order have postpositions instead (like Turkic languages) or have both types (like Finnish). The phrase formed by an adposition together with its complement is called an adpositional phrase (or prepositional phrase, postpositional phrase, etc.). Such a phrase can function as an adjective or as an adverb.

A less common type of adposition is the circumposition, which consists of two parts that appear on each side of the complement. Other terms sometimes used for particular types of adposition include &quot;ambiposition&quot;, &quot;inposition&quot; and &quot;interposition&quot;. Some linguists use the word &quot;preposition&quot; in place of &quot;adposition&quot; regardless of the applicable word order.

==Terminology==
The word &quot;preposition&quot; comes from prefix (pre- prefix) (&quot;before&quot;) and (&quot;to put&quot;). This refers to the situation in Latin and Greek (and in English), where such words are placed before their complement (except sometimes in Ancient Greek), and are hence &quot;pre-positioned&quot;.

In some languages, including Sindhi, Hindustani, Turkish, Hungarian, Korean, and Japanese, the same kinds of words typically come after their complement. To indicate this, they are called &quot;postpositions&quot; (using the prefix &quot;post-&quot;, from Latin &quot;post&quot; meaning &quot;behind, after&quot;). There are also some cases where the function is performed by two parts coming before and after the complement; this is called a &quot;circumposition&quot; (from Latin &quot;circum-&quot; prefix &quot;around&quot;).

In some languages, for example Finnish, some adpositions can be used as both prepositions and postpositions.

Prepositions, postpositions and circumpositions are collectively known as &quot;adpositions&quot; (using the Latin prefix &quot;ad-&quot;, meaning &quot;to&quot;). However, some linguists prefer to use the well-known and longer-established term &quot;preposition&quot; in place of &quot;adposition&quot;, irrespective of position relative to the complement.

==Grammatical properties==
An adposition typically combines with exactly one complement, most often a noun phrase (or, in a different analysis, a determiner phrase). In English, this is generally a noun (or something functioning as a noun, e.g., a gerund), together with its specifier and modifiers such as articles, adjectives, etc. The complement is sometimes called the &quot;object&quot; of the adposition. The resulting phrase, formed by the adposition together with its complement, is called an adpositional phrase or prepositional phrase (PP) (or for specificity, a postpositional or circumpositional phrase).

An adposition establishes a grammatical relationship that links its complement to another word or phrase in the context. It also generally establishes a semantic relationship, which may be spatial (&quot;in&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;under&quot;, ...), temporal (&quot;after&quot;, &quot;during&quot;, ...), or of some other type (&quot;of&quot;, &quot;for&quot;, &quot;via&quot;, ...). The World Atlas of Language Structures treats a word as an adposition if it takes a noun phrase as a complement and indicates the grammatical or semantic relationship of that phrase to the verb in the containing clause.

Some examples of the use of English prepositions are given below. In each case, the prepositional phrase appears in &quot;italics&quot;, the preposition within it appears in bold, and the preposition&#x27;s complement is underlined. As demonstrated in some of the examples, more than one prepositional phrase may act as an adjunct to the same word.
* As an adjunct to a noun:
** the weather &quot;in March&quot;
** cheese from France&quot; with live bacteria&quot;
* As a predicative expression (complement of a copula)
** The key is &quot;under the stone&quot;.
* As an adjunct to a verb:
** sleep &quot;throughout the winter&quot;
** danced &quot;atop the tables for hours&quot;
** dispense &quot;with the formalities&quot; (see Semantic functions, above)
* As an adjunct to an adjective:
** happy &quot;for them&quot;
** sick &quot;until recently&quot;

In the last of these examples the complement has the form of an adverb, which has been nominalised to serve as a noun phrase; see Different forms of complement, below. Prepositional phrases themselves are sometimes nominalized:
* &quot;In the cellar&quot; was chosen as the best place to store the wine.

An adposition may determine the grammatical case of its complement. In English, the complements of prepositions take the objective case where available (&quot;from him&quot;, not *&quot;from he&quot;). In Koine Greek, for example, certain prepositions always take their objects in a certain case (e.g., ἐν always takes its object in the dative), while other prepositions may take their object in one of two or more cases, depending on the meaning of the preposition (e.g., διά takes its object in the genitive or the accusative, depending on the meaning). Some languages have cases that are used exclusively after prepositions (prepositional case), or special forms of pronouns for use after prepositions (prepositional pronoun).

The functions of adpositions overlap with those of case markings (for example, the meaning of the English preposition &quot;of&quot; is expressed in many languages by a genitive case ending), but adpositions are classed as syntactic elements, while case markings are morphological.

Adpositions themselves are usually non-inflecting (&quot;invariant&quot;): they do not have paradigms of the form (such as tense, case, gender, etc.) the same way that verbs, adjectives, and nouns can. There are exceptions, though, such as prepositions that have fused with a pronominal object to form inflected prepositions.

The following properties are characteristic of most adpositional systems:
* Adpositions are among the most frequently occurring words in languages that have them. For example, one frequency ranking for English word forms begins as follows (prepositions in bold):
::&quot;the, of, and, to, a, in, that, it, is, was, I, for, on, you&quot;, …
* The most common adpositions are single, monomorphemic words. According to the ranking cited above, for example, the most common English prepositions are &quot;on&quot;, &quot;in&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;by&quot;, &quot;for&quot;, &quot;with&quot;, &quot;at&quot;, &quot;of&quot;, &quot;from&quot;, &quot;as&quot;, all of which are single-syllable words and cannot be broken down into smaller units of meaning.
* Adpositions form a closed class of lexical items and cannot be productively derived from words of other categories.

==Classification of adpositions==
As noted above, adpositions are referred to by various terms, depending on their position relative to the complement.

While the term &quot;preposition&quot; sometimes denotes any adposition, its stricter meaning refers only to one that precedes its complement. Examples of this, from English, have been given above; similar examples can be found in many European and other languages, for example:
*German: (&quot;with a woman&quot;)
*French: (&quot;on the table&quot;)
*Welsh: (&quot;on the table&quot;)
*Polish: &quot;na stole&quot; (&quot;on the table&quot;)
*Russian: &quot;у меня&quot; (&quot;in the possession of me&quot; [I have])
*Khmer: លើក្តារខៀន [ləː kdaːkʰiən] (&quot;on (the) blackboard&quot;)
*Tigrinya: አብ ልዕሊ ጣውላ [abː lɨʕli tʼawla] (&quot;at/on top table&quot;); አብ ትሕቲ ጣውላ [abː tɨħti tʼawla] (&quot;at/on under table&quot;)

In certain grammatical constructions, the complement of a preposition may be absent or may be moved from its position directly following the preposition. This may be referred to as preposition stranding (see also below), as in &quot;Whom did you go with?&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s only one thing worse than being talked about.&quot; There are also some (mainly colloquial) expressions in which a preposition&#x27;s complement may be omitted, such as &quot;I&#x27;m going to the park. Do you want to come with [me]?&quot;, and the French &quot;Il fait trop froid, je ne suis pas habillée pour&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s too cold, I&#x27;m not dressed for [the situation].&quot;)
The bolded words in these examples are generally still considered prepositions because when they form a phrase with a complement (in more ordinary constructions) they must appear first.

A &quot;postposition&quot; follows its complement to form a postpositional phrase. Examples include:
*Latin: (&quot;with me&quot;, literally &quot;me with&quot;)
*Turkish: or (&quot;with me&quot;, literally &quot;my with&quot;) 
*Hungarian: (&quot;under the tree&quot;, literally &quot;tree under&quot;) 
*Chinese: 桌子上 &quot;zhuōzi shàng&quot; (lit. &quot;table on&quot;); this is a nominal form, which usually requires an additional preposition to form an adverbial phrase (see Chinese locative phrases)
*English: &quot;ten kilometers away, &quot;ten months ago (both could be considered adverbs)

Some adpositions can appear either before or after their complement:
* English: &quot;the evidence notwithstanding OR notwithstanding the evidence&quot;
* German: &quot;meiner Meinung nach OR nach meiner Meinung&quot; (&quot;in my opinion&quot;)
* German: &quot;die Straße entlang OR entlang der Straße&quot; (&quot;along the road&quot;; here a different case is used when &quot;entlang&quot; precedes the noun)
An adposition like the above, which can be either a preposition or a postposition, can be called an ambiposition. However, &quot;ambiposition&quot; may also be used to refer to a circumposition (see below), or to a word that appears to function as a preposition and postposition simultaneously, as in the Vedic Sanskrit construction (noun-1) &quot;ā&quot; (noun-2), meaning &quot;from (noun-1) to (noun-2)&quot;.

Whether a language has primarily prepositions or postpositions is seen as an aspect of its typological classification, and tends to correlate with other properties related to head directionality. Since an adposition is regarded as the head of its phrase, prepositional phrases are head-initial (or right-branching), while postpositional phrases are head-final (or left-branching). There is a tendency for languages that feature postpositions also to have other head-final features, such as verbs that follow their objects; and for languages that feature prepositions to have other head-initial features, such as verbs that precede their objects. This is only a tendency, however; an example of a language that behaves differently is Latin, which employs mostly prepositions, even though it typically places verbs after their objects.

A &quot;circumposition&quot; consists of two or more parts, positioned on both sides of the complement. Circumpositions are very common in Pashto and Kurdish. The following are examples from Northern Kurdish (Kurmanji):
* &quot;bi ... re&quot; (&quot;with&quot;)
* &quot;di ... de&quot; (&quot;in&quot;, for things, not places)
* &quot;di ... re&quot; (&quot;via, through&quot;)
* &quot;ji ... re&quot; (&quot;for&quot;)
* &quot;ji ... ve&quot; (&quot;since&quot;)

Various constructions in other languages might also be analyzed as circumpositional, for example:
* English: from now on
* Dutch: naar het einde toe (&quot;towards the end&quot;, lit. &quot;to the end to&quot;)
* Chinese: 从冰箱里 cóng bīngxiāng lǐ (&quot;from the inside of the refrigerator&quot;, lit. &quot;from refrigerator inside&quot;)
* French: à un détail près (&quot;except for one detail&quot;, lit. &quot;at one detail near&quot;)
* Swedish: för tre timmar sedan (&quot;three hours ago&quot;, lit. &quot;for three hours since&quot;)
* German: aus dem Zimmer heraus (&quot;out from the room&quot;, lit. &quot;from the room out&quot;)
* Tigrinya: ካብ ሕጂ &#x27;ንደሓር (&quot;from now on&quot;, lit. &quot;from now to later&quot;)
Most such phrases, however, can be analyzed as having a different hierarchical structure (such as a prepositional phrase modifying a following adverb). The Chinese example could be analyzed as a prepositional phrase headed by &quot;cóng&quot; (&quot;from&quot;), taking the locative noun phrase &quot;bīngxīang lǐ&quot; (&quot;refrigerator inside&quot;) as its complement.

An inposition is a rare type of adposition that appears between parts of a complex complement. For example, in the native Californian Timbisha language, the phrase &quot;from a mean cold&quot; can be translated using the word order &quot;cold from mean&quot;—the inposition follows the noun but precedes any following modifiers that form part of the same noun phrase. The Latin word &quot;cum&quot; is also commonly used as an inposition, as in the phrase &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, meaning &quot;with highest praise&quot;, lit. &quot;highest with praise&quot;.

The term interposition has been used for adpositions in structures such as &quot;word for word&quot;, French &quot;coup sur coup&quot; (&quot;one after another, repeatedly&quot;), and Russian друг с другом (&quot;one with the other&quot;). This is not a case of an adposition appearing inside its complement, as the two nouns do not form a single phrase (there is no phrase *&quot;word word&quot;, for example); such uses have more of a coordinating character.

Preposition stranding is a syntactic construct in which a preposition occurs somewhere other than immediately before its complement. For example, in the English sentence &quot;What did you sit on?&quot; the preposition &quot;on&quot; has &quot;what&quot; as its complement, but &quot;what&quot; is moved to the start of the sentence, because it is an interrogative word. This sentence is much more common and natural than the equivalent sentence without stranding: &quot;On what did you sit?&quot; Preposition stranding is commonly found in English, as well as North Germanic languages such as Swedish. Its existence in German is debated. Preposition stranding is also found in some Niger–Congo languages such as Vata and Gbadi, and in some North American varieties of French.

Some prescriptive English grammars teach that prepositions cannot end a sentence, although there is no rule prohibiting that use. Similar rules arose during the rise of classicism, when they were applied to English in imitation of classical languages such as Latin. Otto Jespersen, in his &quot;Essentials of English Grammar&quot; (first published 1933), commented on this definition-derived rule: &quot;...nor need a preposition (Latin: &quot;praepositio&quot;) stand before the word it governs (go the fools &quot;among&quot; (Sh[akespeare]); What are you laughing &quot;at&quot;?). You might just as well believe that all blackguards are black or that turkeys come from Turkey; many names have either been chosen unfortunately at first or have changed their meanings in the course of time.&quot;

==Simple &quot;versus&quot; complex==

Simple adpositions consist of a single word (&quot;on&quot;, &quot;in&quot;, &quot;for&quot;, &quot;towards&quot;, etc.). Complex adpositions consist of a group of words that act as one unit. Examples of complex prepositions in English include &quot;in spite of&quot;, &quot;with respect to&quot;, &quot;except for&quot;, &quot;by dint of&quot;, and &quot;next to&quot;.

The distinction between simple and complex adpositions is not clear-cut. Many complex adpositions are derived from simple forms (e.g., &quot;with + in&quot; → &quot;within&quot;, &quot;by + side&quot; → &quot;beside&quot;) through grammaticalisation. This change takes time, and during the transitional stages, the adposition acts in some ways like a single word, and in other ways like a multi-word unit. For example, current German orthographic conventions recognize the indeterminate status of certain prepositions, allowing two spellings: &quot;anstelle&quot;/&quot;an Stelle&quot; (&quot;instead of&quot;), &quot;aufgrund&quot;/&quot;auf Grund&quot; (&quot;because of&quot;), &quot;mithilfe&quot;/&quot;mit Hilfe&quot; (&quot;by means of&quot;), &quot;zugunsten&quot;/&quot;zu Gunsten&quot; (&quot;in favor of&quot;), &quot;zuungunsten&quot;/&quot;zu Ungunsten&quot; (&quot;to the disadvantage of&quot;), &quot;zulasten/zu Lasten&quot; (&quot;at the expense of&quot;).

The distinction between complex adpositions and free combinations of words is not a black-and-white issue: complex adpositions (in English, &quot;prepositional idioms&quot;) can be more fossilized or less fossilized. In English, this applies to a number of structures of the form &quot;preposition + (article) + noun + preposition&quot;, such as &quot;in front of&quot;, &quot;for the sake of&quot;. The following characteristics are good indications that a given combination is &quot;frozen&quot; enough to be considered a complex preposition in English:
* It contains a word that cannot be used in any other context: &quot;by dint of&quot;, &quot;in lieu of&quot;.
* The first preposition cannot be replaced: &quot;with a view to&quot; but not *&quot;for/without a view to&quot;.
* It is impossible to insert an article, or to use a different article: &quot;on account of&quot; but not *&quot;on an/the account of&quot;; &quot;for the sake of&quot; but not *&quot;for a sake of&quot;.
* The range of possible adjectives is very limited: &quot;in great favor of&quot;, but not *&quot;in helpful favor of&quot;.
* The grammatical number of the noun cannot be changed: &quot;by virtue of&quot; but not *&quot;by virtues of&quot;.
* It is impossible to use a possessive determiner: &quot;in spite of him&quot;, not *&quot;in his spite&quot;.

==Marginal prepositions==

Marginal prepositions are prepositions that have affinities with other word classes, most notably participles. Marginal prepositions behave like prepositions but derive from other parts of speech. Some marginal prepositions in English include &quot;barring&quot;, &quot;concerning&quot;, &quot;considering&quot;, &quot;excluding&quot;, &quot;failing&quot;, &quot;following&quot;, &quot;including&quot;, &quot;notwithstanding&quot;, &quot;regarding&quot;, and &quot;respecting&quot;.

==Proper &quot;versus&quot; improper==

In descriptions of some languages, prepositions are divided into proper (or &quot;essential&quot;) and improper (or &quot;accidental&quot;). A preposition is called improper if it is some other part of speech being used in the same way as a preposition. Examples of simple and complex prepositions that have been so classified include &quot;prima di&quot; (&quot;before&quot;) and &quot;davanti (a)&quot; (&quot;in front of&quot;) in Italian, and &quot;ergo&quot; (&quot;on account of&quot;) and &quot;causa&quot; (&quot;for the sake of&quot;) in Latin. In reference to Ancient Greek, however, an improper preposition is one that cannot also serve as a prefix to a verb.

==Different forms of complement==
As noted above, adpositions typically have noun phrases as complements. This can include nominal clauses and certain types of non-finite verb phrase:
*We can&#x27;t agree &quot;on whether to have children or not&quot; (complement is a nominal clause)
*Let&#x27;s think &quot;about solving this problem&quot; (complement is a gerund phrase)
*&quot;pour encourager les autres&quot; (French: &quot;to encourage the others&quot;, complement is an infinitive phrase)

The word &quot;to&quot; when it precedes the infinitive in English is not a preposition, but rather is a grammatical particle outside of any main word class.

In other cases, the complement may have the form of an adjective or adjective phrase, or an adverbial. This may be regarded as a complement representing a different syntactic category, or simply as an atypical form of noun phrase (see nominalization).
*The scene went &quot;from blindingly bright to pitch black&quot; (complements are adjective phrases)
*I worked there &quot;until recently&quot; (complement is an adverb)
*Come out &quot;from under the bed&quot; (complement is an adverbial)
In the last example, the complement of the preposition &quot;from&quot; is in fact another prepositional phrase. The resulting sequence of two prepositions (&quot;from under&quot;) may be regarded as a complex preposition; in some languages, such a sequence may be represented by a single word, as Russian из-под &quot;iz-pod&quot; (&quot;from under&quot;).

Some adpositions appear to combine with two complements:
* &quot;With Sammy president&quot;, we can all come out of hiding again.
* &quot;For Sammy to become president&quot;, they&#x27;d have to seriously modify the Constitution.
It is more commonly assumed, however, that &quot;Sammy&quot; and the following predicate forms a &quot;small clause&quot;, which then becomes the single complement of the preposition. (In the first example, a word such as &quot;as&quot; may be considered to have been elided, which, if present, would clarify the grammatical relationship.)

==Semantic functions==

Adpositions can be used to express a wide range of semantic relations between their complement and the rest of the context. The relations expressed may be spatial (denoting location or direction), temporal (denoting position in time), or relations expressing comparison, content, agent, instrument, means, manner, cause, purpose, reference, etc.

Most common adpositions are highly polysemous (they have various different meanings). In many cases, a primary, spatial meaning becomes extended to non-spatial uses by metaphorical or other processes. Because of the variety of meanings, a single adposition often has many possible equivalents in another language, depending on the exact context. This can cause difficulties in foreign language learning. Usage can also vary between dialects of the same language (for example, American English has &quot;on the weekend&quot;, whereas British English uses &quot;at the weekend&quot;).

In some contexts (as in the case of some phrasal verbs) the choice of adposition may be determined by another element in the construction or be fixed by the construction as a whole. Here the adposition may have little independent semantic content of its own, and there may be no clear reason why the particular adposition is used rather than another. Examples of such expressions are:
* English: &quot;dispense with, &quot;listen to, &quot;insist on, &quot;proud of, &quot;good at&quot;
* Russian: &quot;otvechat&#x27; na vopros&quot; (&quot;answer the question&quot;, literally &quot;answer on the question&quot;), &quot;obvinenie v obmane&quot; (&quot;accusation of [literally: in] fraud&quot;)
* Spanish: &quot;soñar con ganar el título&quot; (&quot;dream about [lit. with] winning the title&quot;), &quot;consistir en dos grupos&quot; (&quot;consist of [lit. in] two groups&quot;)

Prepositions sometimes mark roles that may be considered largely grammatical:
* possession (in a broad sense) – &quot;the pen of my aunt&quot; (sometimes marked by genitive or possessive forms)
* the agent in passive constructions – &quot;killed by a lone gunman&quot;
* the recipient of a transfer – &quot;give it to him&quot; (sometimes marked by a dative or an indirect object)

Spatial meanings of adpositions may be either &quot;directional&quot; or &quot;static&quot;. A directional meaning usually involves motion in a particular direction (&quot;Kay went to the store&quot;), the direction in which something leads or points (&quot;A path into the woods&quot;), or the extent of something (&quot;The fog stretched from London to Paris&quot;). A static meaning indicates only a location (&quot;at the store&quot;, &quot;behind the chair&quot;, &quot;on the moon&quot;). Some prepositions can have both uses: &quot;he sat in the water&quot; (static); &quot;he jumped in the water&quot; (probably directional). In some languages, the case of the complement varies depending on the meaning, as with several prepositions in German, such as &quot;in&quot;:
* &quot;in seinem Zimmer&quot; (&quot;in his room&quot;, static meaning, takes the dative)
* &quot;in sein Zimmer&quot; (&quot;into his room&quot;, directional meaning, takes the accusative)

In English and many other languages, prepositional phrases with static meaning are commonly used as predicative expressions after a copula (&quot;Bob is at the store&quot;); this may happen with some directional prepositions as well (&quot;Bob is from Australia&quot;), but this is less common. Directional prepositional phrases combine mostly with verbs that indicate movement (&quot;Jay is going into her bedroom&quot;, but not *&quot;Jay is lying down into her bedroom&quot;).

Directional meanings can be further divided into &quot;telic&quot; and &quot;atelic&quot;. Telic prepositional phrases imply movement all the way to the endpoint (&quot;she ran to the fence&quot;), while atelic ones do not (&quot;she ran towards the fence&quot;).

Static meanings can be divided into &quot;projective&quot; and &quot;non-projective&quot;, where projective meanings are those whose understanding requires knowledge of the perspective or point of view. For example, the meaning of &quot;behind the rock&quot; is likely to depend on the position of the speaker (projective), whereas the meaning of &quot;on the desk&quot; is not (non-projective). Sometimes the interpretation is ambiguous, as in &quot;behind the house,&quot; which may mean either at the natural back of the house or on the opposite side of the house from the speaker.

==Inflected adpositions==

Some languages feature inflected adpositions—adpositions (usually prepositions) marked for grammatical person and/or grammatical number to give meanings such as &quot;on me,&quot; &quot;from you,&quot; etc. In the Indo-European languages this phenomenon is mostly confined to the Celtic languages like Welsh and Irish. Polish also allows some degree of combining prepositions with pronouns in the third person.

===Celtic===

The majority of Welsh prepositions can be inflected. This is achieved by having a preposition such as () + a linking element; in the case of this is + the assimilated pronoun element, resulting in being the preposition&#x27;s &quot;stem&quot; form. It is common in speech for the pronoun to be present after the preposition, but it can be omitted. Unless used with a pronoun the form is always and not the &quot;stem&quot;, e.g. – , – .

The following table gives the inflected forms of the preposition (). The optional pronouns that follow the inflected forms are given in parentheses.


===Semitic===
Inflected prepositions are found in Semitic languages, including Hebrew, Arabic, Assyrian Neo-Aramaic and Amharic.

For example, the Arabic preposition () inflects as () , ) () , () , etc.

===Other languages===
Some Iranic languages, including Persian, have developed inflected prepositions. For example, Persian becomes ; becomes .

In Iberian Romance languages such as Spanish and Portuguese, the preposition or has special forms incorporating certain pronouns (depending on the language). For example, in Spanish and Asturian means . Historically, this developed from the Latin use of after a pronoun, as in .

Bororo, an indigenous language of Brazil, uses postpositions in all contexts: . When these modify a pronoun rather than a full noun, the phrase contracts into an inflected postposition (and therefore looks like a pronominal prefix, rather than a suffix as in the examples above: , ).

==Overlaps with other categories==

===Adverbs and particles===
There are often similarities in form between adpositions and adverbs. Some adverbs are derived from the fusion of a preposition and its complement (such as &quot;downstairs&quot;, from &quot;down (the) stairs&quot;, and &quot;underground&quot;, from &quot;under (the) ground&quot;). Some words can function both as adverbs and as prepositions, such as &quot;inside&quot;, &quot;aboard&quot;, &quot;underneath&quot; (for instance, one can say &quot;go inside&quot;, with adverbial use, or &quot;go inside the house&quot;, with prepositional use). Such cases are analogous to verbs that can be used either transitively or intransitively, and the adverbial forms might therefore be analyzed as &quot;intransitive prepositions&quot;. This analysis could also be extended to other adverbs, such as &quot;here&quot; (this place), &quot;there&quot; (that place), &quot;afterward&quot;, etc., even though these never take complements.

Many English phrasal verbs contain particles that are used adverbially, even though they mostly have the form of a preposition (such words may be called prepositional adverbs). Examples are &quot;on&quot; in &quot;carry on&quot;, &quot;get on&quot;, etc., and &quot;over&quot; in &quot;take over&quot;, &quot;fall over&quot;, and so on. The equivalents in Dutch and German are separable prefixes, which also often have the same form as prepositions: for example, Dutch &quot;aanbieden&quot; and German &quot;anbieten&quot; (both meaning &quot;to offer&quot;) contain the separable prefix &quot;aan/an&quot;, which is also a preposition meaning &quot;on&quot; or &quot;to&quot;.

===Conjunctions===

Some words can be used both as adpositions and as subordinating conjunctions:
* (preposition) &quot;before/after/since the end of the summer&quot;
* (conjunction) &quot;before/after/since the summer ended&quot;
* (preposition) &quot;It looks like another rainy day&quot;
* (conjunction) &quot;It looks like it&#x27;s going to rain again today&quot;
It would be possible to analyze such conjunctions (or even other subordinating conjunctions) as prepositions that take an entire clause as a complement.

===Verbs===

In some languages, including a number of Chinese varieties, many of the words that serve as prepositions can also be used as verbs. For instance, in Standard Chinese, 到 &quot;dào&quot; can be used in either a prepositional or a verbal sense:
* 我到北京去 &quot;wǒ dào Běijīng qù&quot; (&quot;I go to Beijing&quot;; &quot;qù&quot;, meaning &quot;to go&quot;, is the main verb, &quot;dào&quot; is prepositional meaning &quot;to&quot;)
* 我到了 &quot;wǒ dào le&quot; (&quot;I have arrived&quot;; &quot;dào&quot; is the main verb, meaning &quot;to arrive&quot;)
Because of this overlap, and the fact that a sequence of prepositional phrases and verb phrases often resembles a serial verb construction, Chinese prepositions (and those of other languages with similar grammatical structures) are often referred to as coverbs.

As noted in previous sections, Chinese can also be said to have postpositions, although these can be analyzed as nominal (noun) elements. For more information, see the article on Chinese grammar, particularly the sections on coverbs and locative phrases.

===Case affixes===

Some grammatical case markings have a similar function to adpositions; a case affix in one language may be equivalent in meaning to a preposition or postposition in another. For example, in English, the agent of a passive construction is marked by the preposition &quot;by&quot;, while in Russian it is marked by the use of the instrumental case. Sometimes such equivalences exist within a single language; for example, the genitive case in German is often interchangeable with a phrase using the preposition &quot;von&quot; (just as in English, the preposition &quot;of&quot; is often interchangeable with the possessive suffix &quot;&quot;).

Adpositions combine syntactically with their complement, whereas case markings combine with a noun morphologically. In some instances it may not be clear which applies; the following are some possible means of making such a distinction:
* Two adpositions can usually be joined with a coordinating conjunction and share a single complement (&quot;of and for the people&quot;), whereas this is generally not possible with case affixes;
* One adposition can usually combine with two coordinated complements (&quot;of the city and the world&quot;), whereas a case affix would need to be repeated with each noun (Latin &quot;urbis et orbis&quot;, not *urb- et orbis&quot;);
* Case markings combine primarily with nouns, whereas adpositions can combine with (nominalized) phrases of different categories;
* A case marking usually appears directly on the noun, but an adposition can be separated from the noun by other words;
* Within the noun phrase, determiners and adjectives may agree with the noun in case (case spreading), but an adposition only appears once;
* A language can have hundreds of adpositions (including complex adpositions), but no language has that many distinct morphological cases.

Even so, a clear distinction cannot always be made. For example, the post-nominal elements in Japanese and Korean are sometimes called case particles and sometimes postpositions. Sometimes they are analyzed as two different groups because they have different characteristics (e.g., the ability to combine with focus particles), but in such analysis, it is unclear which words should fall into which group.

Turkish, Finnish and Hungarian have both extensive case-marking and postpositions, but there is evidence to help distinguish the two:
* Turkish: (case) &quot;sinemaya (cinema-&quot;dative&quot;, &quot;to the cinema&quot;) vs. (postposition) &quot;sinema için (&quot;for the cinema&quot;)
* Finnish: (case) &quot;talossa&quot; (house-&quot;inessive&quot;, &quot;in the house&quot;) vs. (postposition) &quot;talon edessä (house-&quot;genitive&quot; in front, &quot;in front of the house&quot;)
* Hungarian: (case) &quot;tetőn&quot; (roof-&quot;superessive&quot;, &quot;on the roof&quot;) vs. (postposition) &quot;tető alatt (&quot;under the roof&quot;)

In these examples, the case markings form a word with their hosts (as shown by vowel harmony, other word-internal effects and agreement of adjectives in Finnish), while the postpositions are independent words. As is seen in the last example, adpositions are often used in conjunction with case affixes – in languages that have a case, a given adposition usually takes a complement in a particular case, and sometimes (as has been seen above) the choice of the case helps specify the meaning of the adposition.

<text>The State Protection Authority (, ÁVH) was the secret police of the People&#x27;s Republic of Hungary from 1945 to 1956. The ÁVH was conceived as an external appendage of the Soviet Union&#x27;s KGB in Hungary responsible for supporting the ruling Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party and persecuting political criminals. The ÁVH gained a reputation for brutality during a series of purges but was gradually reined in under the government of Imre Nagy, a moderate reformer, after he was appointed Prime Minister of Hungary in 1953. The ÁVH was dissolved by Nagy&#x27;s revolutionary government during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and succeeded by the Ministry of Internal Affairs III.

Archived data related to the ÁVH and the Ministry of Internal Affairs III are made available through the .

==History==
This is a summary of the organisations acting as political police between 1945 and 1956.
* 1945: Budapest Department of State Political Police, (&quot;Budapesti Főkapitányság Politikai Rendészeti Osztálya&quot;, PRO)
* 1946: Hungarian State Police State Defense Department, (&quot;Magyar Államrendőrség Államvédelmi Osztálya&quot;, ÁVO)
* 1950: State Protection Authority, (&quot;Államvédelmi Hatóság&quot;, ÁVH)
* 1956: the agency was abolished by the revolutionary government of Imre Nagy.

Between 1945 and 1952, Gábor Péter (Benjamin Eisenberger) was the absolute head of the State Protection Authority &quot;(Államvédelmi Hatóság)&quot;, responsible for much cruelty, brutality and many political purges. László Rajk, the Communist Minister of Interior played a crucial role in organizing the State Protection Authority (ÁVH), but in 1949 he was one of its victims. 

===1953 Wallenberg show trial preparations===
ÁVH actions were not subject to judicial review and remained so until the early post-Stalin era. On April 7, 1953, early in the morning, Miksa Domonkos, one of the leaders of the Neologue Jewish community in Budapest was kidnapped by ÁVH officials to extract &quot;confessions&quot;. Preparations for a show trial started in Budapest in 1953 to prove that Raoul Wallenberg had not been dragged off in 1945 to the Soviet Union but was the victim of cosmopolitan Zionists. For the purposes of this show trial, two more Jewish leaders – Dr. László Benedek and Lajos Stöckler (a leader of Hungary&#x27;s Neologue Jews) – as well as two would-be &quot;eyewitnesses&quot; – Pál Szalai and Károly Szabó – were arrested and interrogated by torture.

The last people to meet Wallenberg in Budapest were Ottó Fleischmann, Károly Szabó, and Pál Szalai, who were invited to a supper at the Swedish Embassy building in Gyopár street on January 12, 1945. The next day, January 13, Wallenberg contacted the Russians. By 1953, Ottó Fleischmann had left Hungary, working as a physician in Vienna, Antwerp, Ghent, Milan, Turin &amp; Genoa.

On 8 April 1953, Károly Szabó was captured on the street and arrested without any legal procedure. His family had no news of him throughout the following six months. A secret trial was conducted against him of which no official record is available to date. After six months of interrogation, the defendants were driven to despair and exhaustion.

The idea that the &quot;murderers of Wallenberg&quot; were Budapest Zionists was primarily supported by Hungarian Communist leader and democratic reformer Ernő Gerő (a non-Jewish Jew born as Ernő Singer), which is shown by a note sent by him to First Secretary Mátyás Rákosi (another non-Jewish Jew born as Mátyás Rosenfeld). The show trial was then initiated in Moscow, following Stalin&#x27;s anti-Zionist campaign. After the death of Stalin and somewhat later execution of the former NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria, the preparations for the trial were eventually stopped and the arrested persons were released in fall 1953 under condition that they are not to divulge any part of the arrest. Lajos Stöckler became severely impaired psychologically from torture. Miksa Domonkos spent a week in hospital and died shortly afterwards at home, mainly due to the torture he had been subjected to.

===In Hungarian Revolution of 1956===
During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, elements of the insurgents tracked down and killed both known and suspected ÁVH officers and informants. When the Revolution began, a crowd of some thousand people attacked the police headquarters in Budapest, shouting slogans such as &quot;tear down the star!&quot; and &quot;free the prisoners!&quot;, referring to the enormous red star that stood on the building&#x27;s roof, a symbol of communism and to the many prisoners kept inside. Fearing for the lives of both himself and his officers, the chief of the police let the crowd into the building, allowing them to take any political prisoners they wanted.

During and after the siege of the Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party headquarters (in Republic Square, &quot;Köztársaság tér&quot;), some members of the ÁVH were lynched, a fact later extensively used in party propaganda to back up the claim that the revolution was of a &quot;fascistic, anti-Semitic and reactionary&quot; nature.

===Persecution by József Dudás&#x27; militia===
Attacks on the ÁVH became a significant activity only as informal truces developed between the student-controlled combat organisations and the Soviet troops in Budapest. Freed from the necessity of immediate combat, the József Dudás militia planned a series of reprisals against ÁVH officers, informants, and on a few occasions against ordinary Communist-party members caught up in the revolution.

On October 29, in the second week of the revolution, the Dudás militia attacked the headquarters of the secret police in Budapest, massacring the ÁVH inside. This event was well documented by both western and eastern journalists and photographers, and constituted the primary evidence against Imre Nagy and other members of his cabinet in the White Books.

A Western eyewitness said:

:The secret police lie twisted in the gutter [...] the Hungarians will not touch the corpse of an ÁVH man, not even to close the eyes or straighten the neck.

After Dudás&#x27; militia assaulted the building, the surrounding crowd lynched a number of ÁVH officers. Highly visible in photographs of this attack are the party&#x27;s paybooks displayed on to the corpses, demonstrating that ÁVH soldiers received at least 10 times the wages of a manual worker.

====Reaction of revolutionary forces to Dudás====
When the students&#x27; and workers&#x27; councils discovered what the Dudás group was doing, they instituted armed patrols to arrest and detain ÁVH members for their own safety, and for future planned trials. As a result of Dudás&#x27; massacres, and the students&#x27; policy of arrest, many ÁVH voluntarily turned themselves in to students&#x27; or workers&#x27; councils to seek protective custody. This was a reflection of the shared student-worker policy of keeping the revolution pure and bloodless. Dudás was sought for arrest by the students&#x27; and workers&#x27; councils.

===Retaliation===
Unsurprisingly, when the Warsaw Pact intervened in the revolution to support the government, ÁVH officers carried out brutal reprisals against those who had killed their comrades. The ÁVH generally targeted all revolutionaries, and received significant assistance from the Soviet Union&#x27;s security apparatus, who arrested the Nagy government, General Pál Maléter, and deported one student and workers to the Soviet Union.

===House of Terror===
Shortly after the Arrow Cross Party left it, the building under the address 60 Andrássy Avenue became the ÁVH Headquarters. The building is now a museum called &quot;The House of Terror&quot;, commemorating the victims of both political systems.

===End of ÁVH===
The subsequent government of János Kádár did not wish to resurrect the ÁVH under this name after 1956 (Kádár was tortured by the ÁVH in the 1950s), yet it flourished in the system of the Ministry of Interior (Hungarian BM). This should be considered in the light of the use of the Soviet security apparatus directly in Hungary after the 1956 revolution, and in preparation for the trial of Nagy and &quot;his accomplices&quot;. Between 1956 and 1963 Kádár, a natural opportunist, fought an inner party battle against hardline Stalinists, although he accepted the services of many cruel former AVH torturers.

Kádár&#x27;s victory was signalled in 1963 by a general amnesty for the 1956 revolutionaries, an indication of the absence of a political police. Hungary would go on to be the only Warsaw Pact country without a formal intelligence service, since all intelligence and espionage functions were vested in the AVH, and later the Hungarian Ministry of Interior.

==Duties==
While the security apparatus was operating, it supported the Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party (MDP) directly, with little reference made to Government norms. This support was primarily through the secret gathering of intelligence, largely through a vast network of informants, like the system used by the Ministry for State Security (Stasi) in the German Democratic Republic.

The investigation network was supplemented with a mechanism of secret arrests, followed by extensive periods of torture (lasting between 3 and 18 months). When the apparatus had extracted confessions of varying quality from a prisoner, the State&#x27;s system of public procurators and courts would be called in to make a ruling on the sentence. This was the norm of operation for the ÁVH, and was diverged from in matters of only utmost state security; for example, the illegal arrest and indefinite solitary detention of the Communist Party of Great Britain operative Edith Bone. Despite the forced nature of confessions, retractions at trial were not considered a danger to the process, due to the obvious threat of continued torture during a recess of the trial.

===International activities===
The ÁVH also assisted the Soviet sphere security apparatus by staging show trials. In two cases, the ÁVH was given the privilege of leading an attack on undesired elements throughout Hungary. In 1948 the Roman Catholic Cardinal József Mindszenty was tried and imprisoned. In 1949, the ÁVH arrested Hungarian Communist Party member László Rajk, who was then tried and executed for nationalism and Titoism in a show trial that signified to the international communist movement that Yugoslavia was now a threat. (László Rajk was the man who had organised the ÁVH.)

===Concentration camps===
Following sentence, political prisoners were imprisoned. To serve this purpose, more penal institutions (the prison in Vác, the transit prison, the state security prison in Mosonyi Street) and internment camps (in Kistarcsa, Recsk, Tiszalök, Kazincbarcika and according to the latest research, in Bernátkút and Sajóbábony) were placed under the supervision of the State Protection Authority. The most notorious of these camps were in Recsk, Kistarcsa, Tiszalök and Kazincbarcika.
These camps were mixed and varied. Early camps tended to be cruder and more cruel. In particular, the status of ex-party members varied. In camps prior to 1953 they were more harshly treated than other prisoners. After 1953, ex-party members were a virtual aristocracy within prisons. Additionally, prior to 1953 certain camps had as their goal the eventual death of inmates due to overwork and maltreatment. In a number of cases, torture was an essential part of camp life and discipline.

Imre Nagy&#x27;s first government from 1953 to 1955 vastly improved conditions in the camps and halted the efforts to exterminate political prisoners.

==Successor==
The Hungarian Ministry of Interior created the Ministry of Internal Affairs III for domestic and foreign intelligence purposes until the end of the Cold War. It operated with considerably more restraint than the ÁVH.

<doc id="199363" wikidata="Q3521457" url="?curid=199363" title="The Kansas City Star">
<text>The Kansas City Star is a newspaper based in Kansas City, Missouri. Published since 1880, the paper is the recipient of eight Pulitzer Prizes.

&quot;The Star&quot; is most notable for its influence on the career of President Harry S. Truman and as the newspaper where a young Ernest Hemingway honed his writing style. The paper is the major newspaper of the Kansas City metropolitan area and has widespread circulation in western Missouri and eastern Kansas.

==History==
===Nelson family ownership (1880–1926)===
The paper, originally called &quot;The Kansas City Evening Star&quot;, was founded September 18, 1880, by William Rockhill Nelson and Samuel E. Morss. The two moved to Missouri after selling the newspaper that became the &quot;Fort Wayne News Sentinel&quot; (and earlier owned by Nelson&#x27;s father) in Nelson&#x27;s Indiana hometown, where Nelson was campaign manager in the unsuccessful presidential run of Samuel Tilden.

Morss quit the newspaper business within a year and a half because of ill health.
At the time there were three daily competitors – the &quot;Evening Mail&quot;; The &quot;Kansas City Times&quot;; and the &quot;Kansas City Journal.&quot;

Competitor &quot;Times&quot; editor Eugene Field wrote this about the new newspaper:

: &quot;Twinkle, twinkle, little Star&quot;
: &quot;Bright and gossipy you are;&quot;
: &quot;We can daily hear you speak&quot;
: &quot;For a paltry dime a week.&quot;

Nelson&#x27;s business strategy called for cheap advance subscriptions and an intention to be &quot;absolutely independent in politics, aiming to deal by all men and all parties with impartiality and fearlessness.&quot;.

He purchased the &quot;Kansas City Evening Mail&quot; (and its Associated Press evening franchise) in 1882. The paper name was changed to &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; in 1885. Nelson started the &quot;Weekly Kansas City Star&quot; in 1890 and the &quot;Sunday Kansas City Star&quot; in 1894. In 1901 Nelson also bought the morning paper &quot;The Kansas City Times&quot; (and its morning Associated Press franchise). Nelson announced the arrival of the &quot;24 Hour &quot;Star&quot;.&quot;

In August 1902, future president Harry S. Truman worked in the mailroom for two weeks, making $7.00 the first week and $5.40 the second. In 1950, then-president Truman half joked in an unmailed letter to &quot;Star&quot; editor Roy Roberts, &quot;If the &quot;Star&quot; is at all mentioned in history, it will be because the President of the U.S. worked there for a few weeks in 1901 [&quot;sic&quot;].&quot;

The paper was first printed on the second story of a three-story building at 407–409 Delaware. In 1881, it moved 14 W. 5th Street. In 1882, it moved to 115 W. 6th. In 1889, it moved to 804–806 Wyandotte. Sometime between 1896 and 1907, it was located at 1025–1031 Grand. In 1911, it moved into its Jarvis Hunt-designed building at 18th and Grand.

Nelson died in 1915. Nelson provided in his will that his newspaper was to support his wife and daughter and then be sold.

Ernest Hemingway was a reporter for the &quot;Star&quot; from October 1917 to April 1918. Hemingway credited &quot;Star&quot; editor C.G. &quot;Pete&quot; Wellington with changing a wordy high-schooler&#x27;s writing style into clear, provocative English. Throughout his lifetime, Hemingway referred to this admonition from &quot;The Star Copy Style&quot;, the paper&#x27;s famous and often used style guide:

Use short sentences. Use short first paragraphs. Use vigorous English. Be positive, not negative.

Nelson&#x27;s wife died in 1921; his daughter Laura Kirkwood died in a Baltimore hotel room in 1926 at the age of 43.

===Employee ownership (1926–1977)===
Laura&#x27;s husband Irwin Kirkwood, who was editor of the paper, led the employee purchase. Kirkwood in turn died of a heart attack in 1927 in Saratoga Springs, New York, where he had gone to sell thoroughbred horses. Stock in the company was then distributed among other employees.

Virtually all proceeds from the sale and remains of Nelson&#x27;s $6 million personal fortune were donated to create the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art on the site of Nelson&#x27;s home, Oak Hall. Both papers were purchased by the employees in 1926 following the death of Nelson&#x27;s daughter.

The &quot;Star&quot; enjoyed a pivotal role in American politics beginning in the late 1920s when Iowa-native Herbert Hoover was nominated at the 1928 Republican convention in Kansas City and continuing through 1960 at the conclusion of the presidency of Kansas favorite Dwight D. Eisenhower.

Editor Roy A. Roberts (1887–1967) was to make the newspaper a major force in Kansas politics. Roberts joined the paper in 1909 and was picked by Nelson for the Washington bureau in 1915. Roberts became managing editor in 1928. He was instrumental in pushing Kansas Governor Alf Landon for the Republican nomination in 1936; Landon was defeated in the general election by Franklin D. Roosevelt.

In 1942, the &quot;Journal&quot;, the last daily competitor, ceased publication. The &quot;Journal&quot; had offered unwavering support of Tom Pendergast&#x27;s political machine; once Pendergast had fallen from power, the paper suffered.

In 1945, the paper bought the Flambeau Paper Mill in Park Falls, Wisconsin to provide newsprint. The mill was to be cited for pollution problems and have labor problems, and the Star was to eventually divest itself of the mill in 1971.

Roberts was elevated to president of the &quot;Star&quot; in 1947. The &quot;Star&quot; was not particularly kind to hometown Democrat Harry Truman, who had been backed by famed big city Democratic Machine boss Tom Pendergast. In 1953, the Truman administration in its closing days filed antitrust charges against the &quot;Star&quot; over its ownership of WDAF-TV. The Star launched radio station WDAF on May 16, 1922, and television outlet WDAF-TV on October 19, 1949. The &quot;Star&quot; lost its case and had to sign a consent decree in 1957 that led to the sale of the broadcast stations.

With the influence of the &quot;Star&quot; in Truman&#x27;s hometown, the newspaper and Roberts were the subject of an April 12, 1948, cover issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

In 1954, Topeka correspondent Alvin McCoy won a Pulitzer Prize for a series of articles questioning the business dealings of the Republican national chairman. Roberts reported the Pulitzer Prize in a four-paragraph item.

Roberts semi-retired in 1963, officially retired in 1965, and died in 1967.

===Corporate ownership (1977–present)===

====Capital Cities/Disney (1977–1997)====
Local ownership of the &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;Star&quot; ended in 1977 with their purchase by Capital Cities. In 1990, the &quot;Star&quot; became a morning newspaper taking the place of what was then the larger &quot;Kansas City Times&quot; which ceased publication. The Walt Disney Company acquired Capital Cities/ABC in January 1996. Disney sold the paper to Knight Ridder in May 1997 as Disney moved to concentrate on broadcast rather than newspaper investments. Under Capital Cities ownership, the newspaper won three Pulitzer Prizes (1982, 1982, 1992).

====Knight Ridder/McClatchy (1997–2020)====
Knight Ridder&#x27;s legacy is a massive $199 million, two-block long, glass-enclosed printing and distribution plant on the northeast side of the &quot;Star&quot;&#x27;s landmark red brick headquarters at 1729 Grand Avenue. The plant began printing in June 2006. It took nearly four years to build and is considered a major part of the effort to revitalize downtown Kansas City. The plant contains four 60-foot-high presses. On June 4, 2006, the first edition of the &quot;Star&quot; came out from the new presses with a major redesign in the sections and the logo. The new paper design involved shrinking its broadsheet width from 15 to 12 inches and shrinking the length from 22 to 21  inches. Other broadsheet newspapers across the country, including the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, are moving to the smaller standard size.

The McClatchy Company bought Knight Ridder in June 2006.

In February 2020, McClatchy filed for bankruptcy and Chatham Asset Management LLC bought it at auction. 

On November 10, 2020, the &quot;Star&quot; reported, &quot;Printing of The Star will move up Interstate 35 to the Des Moines Register&quot;.

====Apology for racism in coverage====
On December 21, 2020, the paper issued an apology for a history of racism in its news coverage. A column by Mike Fannin, president and editor, said &quot;For 140 years, it has been one of the most influential forces in shaping Kansas City and the region. And yet for much of its early history—through sins of both commission and omission—it disenfranchised, ignored and scorned generations of Black Kansas Citians. It reinforced Jim Crow laws and redlining. Decade after early decade it robbed an entire community of opportunity, dignity, justice and recognition.&quot; His column launched a six-part series in which the paper promised to deeply examine past coverage by the paper and its former sister paper the &quot;Kansas City Times&quot;, in coverage he described as routinely sickening the reporters who worked on the story.

==Pulitzer Prizes==
The newspaper has won eight Pulitzer Prizes:

* 1931 Pulitzer Prize for Reporting – A. B. MacDonald, &quot;for his work in connection with a murder in Amarillo, Texas.&quot;
* 1933 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing – no author named
* 1944 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing – Henry Haskell, &quot;for editorials written during the calendar year 1943.&quot;
* 1952 Pulitzer Prize Special Citation – &quot;for the news coverage of the great regional flood of 1951 in Kansas and Northwestern Missouri –– a distinguished example of editing and reporting that also gave the advance information that achieved the maximum of public protection.&quot;
* 1954 Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting, No Edition Time – Alvin Scott McCoy, &quot;for a series of exclusive stories which led to the resignation under fire of C. Wesley Roberts as Republican National Chairman.&quot;
* 1982 Pulitzer Prize for Local General or Spot News Reporting – &quot;for coverage of the Hyatt Regency Hotel disaster and identification of its causes&quot; (along with the &quot;Kansas City Times&quot;)
* 1982 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting – Rick Atkinson (of the &quot;Kansas City Times&quot;), &quot;for the uniform excellence of his reporting and writing on stories of national import.&quot;
* 1992 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting – Jeff Taylor and Mike McGraw, &quot;for their critical examination of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.&quot;
* 2022 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary – Melinda Henneberger, &quot;for persuasive columns demanding justice for alleged victims of a retired police detective accused of being a sexual predator.&quot;

===Finalists===
The newspaper has been a finalist for Pulitzers on three occasions:

* 1996 Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Journalism – Chris Lester and Jeffrey Spivak, &quot;for their series on the impact of spreading suburban growth.&quot;
* 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service – &quot;for courageous, revelatory journalism that exposed a state government&#x27;s decades-long &#x27;obsession with secrecy,&#x27; intended to shield executive decisions and suppress transparency and accountability in law enforcement agencies, child welfare services and other sectors of the government.&quot;.
* 2019 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary – Melinda Henneberger, &quot;for examining, in spare and courageous writing, institutional sexism and misogyny within her hometown NFL team, her former governor&#x27;s office and the Catholic Church.&quot;

==Other awards==
In 2018, the paper received two awards at the Scripps Howard Foundation&#x27;s National Journalism Awards.

<doc id="199400" wikidata="Q540244" url="?curid=199400" title="John Taylor (Mormon)">
<text>John Taylor (1 November 1808 – 25 July 1887) was an English-born religious leader who served as the third president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1880 to 1887. He is the first and so far only president of the LDS Church to have been born outside the United States.

== Early life ==
Taylor was born in Milnthorpe, Westmorland (now part of Cumbria), England, the son of James and Agnes Taylor. He had formal schooling up to age fourteen, and then he served an initial apprenticeship to a cooper and later received training as a woodturner and cabinetmaker. He claimed that as a young man, he had a vision of &quot;an angel in the heavens, holding a trumpet to his mouth, sounding a message to the nations&quot;—which he would later identify as the angel Moroni. He was christened in the Church of England, but joined the Methodist church at sixteen. He was appointed a lay preacher a year later, and felt a calling to preach in North America. Taylor&#x27;s parents and siblings emigrated to Upper Canada (present-day Ontario) in 1830. Taylor stayed in England to dispose of the family property and joined his family in Toronto in 1832. He met Leonora Cannon from the Isle of Man while attending a Toronto Methodist Church and, although she initially rejected his proposal, married her on 28 January 1833.

Between 1834 and 1836, John and Leonora Taylor participated in a religious study group in Toronto. The group discussed problems and concerns with their Methodist faith, and quickly became known as the &quot;Dissenters.&quot; Other members included Joseph Fielding and his sisters Mary and Mercy, who later also became prominent in the Latter Day Saint movement. While in Toronto, Taylor continued to work in his trade as a woodturner.

== Early church service ==
Taylor and his wife first came in contact with the Church of the Latter Day Saints in 1836 after meeting Parley P. Pratt, an apostle in the church, in Toronto. Leonora was the first to join the church and she persuaded Taylor to continue his studies with Pratt. After the couple&#x27;s baptism into the church, they were active in preaching and the organization of the church in Upper Canada. Taylor for a time presided over six branches in the Toronto area. In July 1837 he was closely involved in coordinating Joseph Smith&#x27;s visit to the Toronto area. They then moved to Far West, Missouri, where Taylor was ordained an apostle on 19 December 1838. He assisted other church members as they fled frequent conflicts to Commerce, Illinois (soon after renamed Nauvoo).

In 1839, Taylor and some of his fellow apostles served missions in Britain. While there, Taylor preached in Liverpool and was responsible for Mormon preaching in Ireland and the Isle of Man.

== Nauvoo ==
Taylor returned to Nauvoo, Illinois, to serve as a city councilman, a chaplain, a colonel, a newspaper editor, and a judge advocate for the Nauvoo Legion. Taylor edited two newspapers in Nauvoo, &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; and the &quot;Nauvoo Neighbor&quot;. &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; was the official organ of the Latter Day Saint church; he was officially the assistant editor under Joseph Smith, but due to Smith also being president of the church, Taylor made most of the editorial decisions. Taylor also edited the more politically concerned &quot;Nauvoo Neighbor&quot; and the &quot;Wasp&quot;, the predecessor of the &quot;Nauvoo Neighbor&quot;, for about a year. Taylor was thus the editor of Nauvoo&#x27;s two main papers from 1842 to 1846.

In 1842, Taylor was present at the organization of the Relief Society. He set apart Sarah Cleveland and Elizabeth Ann Whitney as counselors to Emma Smith.
In 1844, Taylor was with church founder Joseph Smith, his brother Hyrum Smith, and fellow apostle Willard Richards in the Carthage, Illinois, jail when the Smiths were killed by a mob. Taylor was severely wounded in the conflict. His life may have been spared when a musket ball directed towards his chest was stopped by a pocket watch which he was carrying at the time. However, recent analysis shows the watch may instead have been damaged when Taylor fell against the windowsill.

In 1845, Taylor became the president of the Nauvoo Tradesmen Association. This group worked to encourage local manufacturing of goods for both local use and export. Taylor had two assistants who aided him in running this group, Orson Spencer and Phineas Richards.

== Migration to the Salt Lake Valley ==
In 1846–1847, most Latter-day Saints followed Brigham Young into Iowa then the Salt Lake Valley, while Taylor went to England to resolve problems in church leadership there. On his return, he and Pratt led more Latter-day Saints, a group of about 1500, to the Salt Lake Valley, where Young and the others had settled and established Great Salt Lake City.

==Government positions==
Taylor applied for and was granted United States citizenship in 1849. That same year he was appointed an associate judge in the provisional State of Deseret. He later served in the Utah territorial legislature from 1853 to 1876. Taylor was elected Speaker of the House for five consecutive sessions, beginning in 1857. In 1852, he wrote a small book, &quot;The Government of God&quot;, in which he compared and contrasted the secular and ecclesiastical political systems.

From 1868 to 1870 Taylor served as a probate judge of Utah County, Utah. He also served as superintendent of schools for Utah Territory beginning in 1876.

==Mission president==
Taylor served as president of two missions of the LDS Church. In 1849, he traveled east on his way to begin missionary work in France, stopping at various waypoints in the homes of Mormon pioneers still making their way to the Salt Lake Valley. Taylor was the first church mission president in France. While in France, Taylor published a monthly newspaper called &quot;L&#x27;Etoile du Deseret&quot; with the help of Louis A. Bertrand. He also supervised missionary work in Germany, but did not himself go to any of the countries that would later form Germany.

In 1852, the Book of Mormon was published in French, with Taylor and Curtis E. Bolton credited as translators. Taylor supervised the translation, which was carried out by Bolton, Bertrand, Lazare Auge, and a &quot;Mr. Wilhelm&quot;.

Taylor later served as president of the Eastern States Mission, based in New York City. In this capacity he published a newspaper that presented the position of the Latter-day Saints.

==Utah economic development==
While serving as mission president in France, Taylor was directed by church president Brigham Young to prepare to establish a sugar industry in Utah Territory. This was done under the auspices of the Deseret Manufacturing Company. Taylor purchased sugar-making equipment in Liverpool while returning to the United States. These early attempts to produce sugar in Utah proved unsuccessful.

==Musical ability==
Taylor is reported to have had a marvelous singing voice. At the request of Hyrum Smith, he twice sang the song &quot;A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief&quot; in Carthage Jail just before the Smith brothers&#x27; murders.

Taylor wrote the lyrics to several hymns, some of which are still used by the LDS Church. In 2005, Taylor&#x27;s hymn &quot;Joseph the Seer&quot; was sung at the LDS Church&#x27;s celebration of the 200th anniversary of Joseph Smith&#x27;s birth. The 1985 English-language edition of the LDS Church hymnal includes two hymns with lyrics by Taylor, &quot;Go Ye Messengers of Glory&quot; (no. 262) and &quot;Go, Ye Messengers of Heaven&quot; (no. 327).

== Church president ==
Following Brigham Young&#x27;s death in 1877, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles governed the church, with John Taylor as the quorum&#x27;s president. Taylor became the third president of the church in 1880. He chose as his counselors Joseph F. Smith and George Q. Cannon, the latter being the nephew of his wife, Leonora.

As church president, Taylor oversaw the expansion of the Salt Lake community; the further organization of the church hierarchy; the establishment of Mormon colonies in Wyoming, Colorado, and Arizona as well as in Canada&#x27;s Northwest Territories (now in Alberta) and the Mexican state of Chihuahua; and the defense of plural marriage against increasing government opposition.

While he was church president, Taylor also established Zion&#x27;s Central Board of Trade to coordinate local trade and production, which was done largely through the local stakes, on a wider basis.

In 1878, the Primary Association was founded by Aurelia Spencer Rogers in Farmington, Utah Territory. For a time, the organization was placed under the direction of Relief Society General President Eliza R. Snow. In 1880, Taylor organized the churchwide adoption of the Primary Association and selected Louie B. Felt as its first general president. In October 1880, the Pearl of Great Price was canonized by the church.

Taylor also oversaw the issuance of a new edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. During his term as church president, the seventies quorums were also more fully and regularly organized.

In 1882, the United States Congress enacted the Edmunds Act, which declared polygamy to be a felony. Hundreds of Mormon men and women were arrested and imprisoned for continuing to practice plural marriage. Taylor had followed Brigham Young&#x27;s teachings on polygamy and had at least seven wives. He is known to have fathered 34 children.

Taylor moved into the Gardo House alone with his sister, Agnes, to avoid prosecution and to avoid showing preference to any one of his families. However, by 1885, he and his counselors were forced to withdraw from public view to live in the &quot;underground&quot; and were frequently on the move to avoid arrest. In 1885, during his last public sermon, Taylor remarked, &quot;I would like to obey and place myself in subjection to every law of man. What then? Am I to disobey the law of God? Has any man a right to control my conscience, or your conscience?... No man has a right to do it.&quot;

Many viewed Mormon polygamy as religiously, socially, and politically threatening. In 1887, the US Congress passed the Edmunds–Tucker Act, which abolished women&#x27;s suffrage in Utah Territory, forced wives to testify against their husbands, disincorporated the LDS Church, dismantled the Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company, abolished the Nauvoo Legion, and provided that LDS Church property in excess of $50,000 would be forfeited to the United States.

For two-and-a-half years, Taylor presided over the church from exile. During this period, some Mormon fundamentalist groups claim that he received the 1886 Revelation. Photographs of the original document exist. It restated the permanence of the &quot;New and Everlasting Covenant&quot;, which these fundamentalist groups consider to be a direct reference to the practice of plural marriage. The validity of the revelation is rejected by the LDS Church, which does not consider it to be authentic, but it is used by fundamentalist groups as justification for their continued practice of polygamy.

==Death==
Taylor died on 25 July 1887, from congestive heart failure in Kaysville, Utah Territory. Taylor was buried at the Salt Lake City Cemetery in The Avenues, Salt Lake City, Utah. For two years after his death, the church again was without a presidency. The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, with Wilford Woodruff as president of the quorum, assumed leadership during this interim period. In the April 1889 church general conference, the First Presidency was reorganized with Wilford Woodruff as the president. Six months later, in the October general conference, Anthon H. Lund was called to fill Taylor&#x27;s vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

Taylor&#x27;s teachings as an apostle were the 2003 course of study in the LDS Church&#x27;s Sunday Relief Society and Melchizedek priesthood classes.
==Family==
Taylor practiced plural marriage and was married to eight wives: Leonora Cannon, Elizabeth Kaighin, Jane Ballantyne, Mary Ann Oakley, Sophia Whitaker, Harriet Whitaker, Margaret Young, and Josephine Elizabeth Roueche. He was the father of 34 children.

Taylor&#x27;s son, John W. Taylor, continued to serve in the church and in politics and helped to shepherd Utah to statehood in 1896. John W. Taylor was ultimately excommunicated from the LDS Church for his opposition to the church&#x27;s abandonment of plural marriage. His son, Samuel W. Taylor, became a writer, and the biographer of his father and grandfather.

Another son, William W. Taylor, served as one of the first presidents of the seventy and also served in the Utah territorial legislature.

Taylor&#x27;s wife Margaret Young Taylor was a member of the inaugural general presidency of what is today the church&#x27;s Young Women organization. Taylor&#x27;s daughter Annie Taylor Hyde was a leader in the Relief Society general presidency and was the founder of Daughters of Utah Pioneers.

God is greater than the United States, and when the Government conflicts with heaven, we will be ranged under the banner of heaven and against the Government.&quot;

<doc id="199401" wikidata="Q7233809" url="?curid=199401" title="Postage stamps and postal history of East Africa and Uganda Protectorates">
<text>East Africa and Uganda Protectorates was the name used by the combined postal service of the British protectorates, British East Africa and Uganda, between 1 April 1903 and 22 July 1920.

==East Africa and Uganda Protectorates==

The administration issued postage stamps with the profile of King Edward VII and inscribed in 1903. The same basic design was used throughout the period, with new watermark and colours in 1904 and 1907, respectively, and the substitution of King George V in 1912. The 6c stamp was surcharged 4c in 1919.

While the lower-denomination stamps are common, stamps of up to 500 rupees were sold, primarily for use as revenue stamps. Postal usages of the higher values are scarce and valuable.

==Kenya and Uganda==

On 23 July 1920 British East Africa became a Crown Colony of Kenya, with the exception of a coastal strip which remained a protectorate. Stamps were then inscribed 

== Postal stationery ==

The postal administration of East Africa and Uganda issued post paid envelopes, registration envelopes, wrappers, postcards and a telegram sheet. The designs of the imprints on registrations envelopes, newspaper wrappers and postcards were similar to that used on the stamps.

A total of four post paid envelopes were issued, the stamp imprint on all was oval with the head of king. A one anna envelope was issued in 1904, a six cent envelope was issued in 1907 and finally a 6 cent and a 10 cent envelope was issued with the head of King George in 1912.

Including different sizes, a total of eleven registration envelopes have been identified as having been issued; three during the reign of Edward VII and eight during the reign of George V.

Three different wrappers with the Edward VII design were produced and two with George V.

A total of 12 postcards are known to have been issued; eight during the reign of Edward VII and four during the reign of George V.

One unusual item of postal stationery item, issued in 1903, was a telegram sheet with a one rupee stamp imprint. The design of the stamp was hexagonal with the head of Edward VII in a circle in the centre.

<text>The Dayglo Abortions (sometimes abbreviated to DGA) are a Canadian hardcore punk and metal band from Victoria, British Columbia. Their lyrics reflect a genre-typical disregard for societal norms. The band was formed in 1979 and released their first album in 1981. The band has sold 500,000+ copies worldwide since their first release. The band&#x27;s biography, &quot;Argh Fuck Kill: The Story of the Dayglo Abortions&quot;, by the author Chris Walter, was published in 2010 by Gofuckyerself Press. Gymbo Jak, the lead singer from 1994 to 2007, also sang for the Toronto-based Maximum RNR.

==History==

===Legal trouble===
The band is known for its graphic album covers. In 1988, a police officer in Nepean, Ontario instigated a criminal investigation of the Dayglos after his daughter brought home a copy of &quot;Here Today, Guano Tomorrow&quot;. For the first time in Canadian history, a musical group were to be charged with obscene material in the Supreme Court of Canada. The charges were laid against the Dayglo Abortions and their record label, Fringe Product (carried by Alternative Tentacles in the US and embroiling Dead Kennedys frontman Jello Biafra in the battle for freedom of speech) along with the label&#x27;s record store, Record Peddler. The DayGlo Abortions were cleared of all charges, winning the landmark case after the Supreme Court trial in 1990.

=== Politics ===
On their 2004 album, the Dayglos showed a new-found political awareness. &quot;Holy Shiite&quot; has song titles such as &quot;America Eats Her Young,&quot; &quot;Christina Bin Laden,&quot; &quot;Scientology,&quot; and &quot;Where&#x27;s Bin Laden?&quot;.

<doc id="199405" wikidata="Q2111150" url="?curid=199405" title="Huperzia">
<text>Huperzia is a genus of lycophyte plants, sometimes known as the firmosses or fir clubmosses; the &quot;Flora of North America&quot; calls them gemma fir-mosses. This genus was originally included in the related genus &quot;Lycopodium&quot;, from which it differs in having undifferentiated sporangial leaves, and the sporangia not formed into apical cones. The common name &quot;firmoss&quot;, used for some of the north temperate species, refers to their superficial resemblance to branches of fir (&quot;Abies&quot;), a conifer. , two very different circumscriptions of the genus were in use. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), &quot;Huperzia&quot; is one of three genera in the subfamily Huperzioideae of the family Lycopodiaceae. Most species in the subfamily are placed in the genus &quot;Phlegmariurus&quot;. &quot;Huperzia&quot; is left with about 25 species, although not all have been formally transferred to other genera. Other sources recognize only &quot;Huperzia&quot;, which then has about 340 species.

==Morphology==
The sporophytes of this genus have unbranched shoots that are generally upright and round in cross section. Horizontal stems are absent. The leaves are not borne in distinct ranks, and are usually somewhat lanceolate in shape. In some species, they vary in size according to the season in which they grow. Branchlets bearing gemmae – bud-like structures by which the plant reproduces asexually – occur among the leaves. The gemmae are triangular, with eight leaves in a constant pattern: four flattened into a plane and two large lateral leaves. The sporangia are kidney-shaped (reniform), occurring at the base of a leaf that is either unmodified or reduced. The roots are produced near the apex of shoots, and migrate downwards inside the cortex of the stem to emerge at soil level. The unbranched gametophytes are not photosynthetic, but rather subterranean and mycorrhizal.

The &quot;Flora of North America&quot; distinguishes &quot;Huperzia&quot; from the epiphytic tropical genus &quot;Phlegmariurus&quot; on the basis of differences such as the former&#x27;s complex and specialized shoots, the gemmae and the branchlets on which they are borne, and the unbranched gametophytes.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Huperzia&quot; was created by Johann Jakob Bernhardi in 1801. Bernhardi separated &quot;Huperzia&quot; from &quot;Lycopodium&quot;. The type species is &quot;Lycopodium selago&quot; which became &quot;Huperzia selago&quot;.

In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), &quot;Huperzia&quot; is placed in the subfamily Huperzioideae of the family Lycopodiaceae. A phylogenetic study in 2016, employing both molecular and morphological data, concluded that either a one-genus or a three-genus division of the subfamily produced monophyletic taxa. The authors preferred the three-genus division, recognizing &quot;Huperzia&quot;, &quot;Phlegmariurus&quot; and &quot;Phylloglossum&quot;. Their preferred hypothesis for the relationships of the three genera was:

The majority of the species formerly placed in a broadly defined &quot;Huperzia&quot; belong in &quot;Phlegmariurus&quot;. Earlier, the &quot;Flora of North America&quot; had also separated &quot;Huperzia&quot; from &quot;Phegmariurus&quot;. However, &quot;Phlegmariurus&quot; is difficult to separate morphologically, and others have preferred the one-genus division of the subfamily.

===Species===
The PPG I classification stated there were 25 species in the genus &quot;Huperzia&quot;. , &quot;World Ferns&quot; listed the following species, noting that &quot;many species still need transfer into other split genera&quot;.

*&quot;Huperzia&quot; × &quot;protoporophila&quot; 
*&quot;Huperzia&quot; × &quot;sulcinervia&quot; 

==Distribution and habitat==
As circumscribed in the PPG I classification, &quot;Huperzia&quot; is distributed in temperate, arctic and alpine habitats, including mountains in tropical Asia. Its species are terrestrial or grow on rocks. &quot;Phlegmariurus&quot; is epiphytic, and has a worldwide tropical distribution, so when &quot;Huperzia&quot; is defined broadly to include all three genera of the subfamily Huperzioideae, it has an almost worldwide distribution, absent mainly in North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Western Asia.

<doc id="199406" wikidata="Q232289" url="?curid=199406" title="Michael Smith (chemist)">
<text>Michael Smith (April 26, 1932 – October 4, 2000) was a British-born Canadian biochemist and businessman. He shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Kary Mullis for his work in developing site-directed mutagenesis. Following a PhD in 1956 from the University of Manchester, he undertook postdoctoral research with Har Gobind Khorana (himself a Nobel Prize winner) at the British Columbia Research Council in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Subsequently, Smith worked at the Fisheries Research Board of Canada Laboratory in Vancouver before being appointed a professor of biochemistry in the UBC Faculty of Medicine in 1966. Smith&#x27;s career included roles as the founding director of the UBC Biotechnology Laboratory (1987 to 1995) and the founding scientific leader of the Protein Engineering Network of Centres of Excellence (PENCE). In 1996 he was named Peter Wall Distinguished Professor of Biotechnology. Subsequently, he became the founding director of the Genome Sequencing Centre (now called the Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre) at the BC Cancer Research Centre.

==Education and early life==

Smith was born April 26, 1932, in Blackpool, Lancashire, England. He immigrated to Canada in 1956 and became a Canadian citizen in 1963. Smith married Helen Wood Christie on August 6, 1960, on Vancouver Island, BC, Canada. The couple had three children (Tom, Ian and Wendy) and three grandchildren, but separated in 1983. In his later years, Smith lived with his partner Elizabeth Raines in Vancouver until his death on October 4, 2000.

Smith first attended St. Nicholas Church of England School, a state-run elementary school. At the time, few children from state schools in England went on to further academic education, however Smith did well in the eleven plus exam, and was an exception. A scholarship enabled him to attend the Arnold School for Boys. A further scholarship allowed him to study Chemistry at the University of Manchester, where he pursued his interest in industrial chemistry and was awarded a BSc followed by a PhD in 1956 for research into the stereochemistry of diols.

==Career==

===Researcher===

Smith&#x27;s research career began with a post-doctoral fellowship at the British Columbia Research Council under the supervision of Khorana, who was developing new techniques of synthesizing nucleotides. The application of principles of physics and chemistry to living organisms was new at that time; DNA had been identified as the genetic material of a cell, and Khorana and others were investigating how DNA encoded the proteins that constituted an organism. In 1960, when Khorana was offered and accepted a university position with excellent laboratory facilities in the Institute for Enzyme Research at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Smith moved with him.

After a few months in Wisconsin, Smith returned to Vancouver as a senior scientist and head of the Chemistry Division with the Vancouver Technological Station of the Fisheries Research Board (FRB) of Canada. In this role he conducted studies on the feeding habits and survival of spawning salmon, as well as identification of olfactory stimuli guiding salmon to their birth stream. His main research interest, however, continued to be nucleic acid synthesis, for which he received a United States Public Health Service Research Grant.

Concurrently with conducting research for FRB, Smith held the positions of associate professor at the University of British Columbia&#x27;s (UBC) Department of Biochemistry and honorary professor in the Department of Zoology. In 1966, Smith was appointed a research associate of the Medical Research Council of Canada, working within UBC&#x27;s Department of Biochemistry.

Smith&#x27;s particular area of interest remained the synthesis of oligonucleotides and the characterization of their properties. In 1975–1976, a sabbatical at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in England with Fred Sanger placed Smith at the forefront of research into the organization of genes and genomes and methods of sequencing large DNA molecules. He returned from England as one of the world&#x27;s leading molecular biologists.

Smith and his team began to investigate possibility of the creation of mutations of any site within a viral genome. If possible, this process could be an efficient method to engineer heritable changes in genes. Finally, in 1977 they confirmed Smith&#x27;s theory.

====Site-specific Mutagenesis====

In the late 1970s, Smith concentrated on projects in molecular biology and how the genes within the DNA molecule act as reservoirs and transmitters of biological information. In 1978, Smith, in collaboration with former Fred Sanger lab sabbatical colleague Clyde A. Hutchison III, introduced a new technique known as &quot;oligonucleotide-directed site-directed mutagenesis&quot; into molecular biology, resolving the problem of how to efficiently determine the effect of a single mutant gene. They developed a synthetic DNA technique for introducing site-specific mutations into genes. This permitted comparison of different protein molecules, revealing the role of the initial mutation.

The new technology enabled rapid identification and deliberate alteration of genes for the purpose of changing the characteristics of an organism. It raised the level of possibility of new diagnostic strategies and new treatments for genetic diseases, and even creation of novel artificial forms of life, as the progenitor technique for polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Site-Directed Mutagenesis and Synthetic Biology.

The team&#x27;s paper describing site-directed mutagenesis was published as &quot;Mutagenesis at a Specific Position in a DNA Sequence&quot; in the &quot;Journal of Biological Chemistry&quot; in 1978. For the team&#x27;s work in developing oligonucleotide-directed site-directed mutagenesis, Smith shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Kary Mullis, the inventor of polymerase chain reaction. 

===Administrator===

Smith was an administrator in 1981 at the Faculty of Medicine elected representative to the UBC Senate. He served on the advisory committee of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research Evolutionary Biology Program and on the Biotechnology Sector Committee of British Columbia. 1982 Smith launched the Centre for Molecular Genetics in the Faculty of Medicine and became its director in 1986. He was the interim scientific director of the UBC Biomedical Research Centre in 1991.

====Biotechnology Laboratory and PENCE====

In 1987, the Biotechnology Laboratory, one of three provincial &quot;Centres of Excellence&quot; was established at UBC. The new facility subsumed the Centre for Molecular Genetics, and Smith became its director. He played an important role in drawing together scientists, and in writing the proposal for what would become the &quot;Protein Engineering Network of Centres of Excellence&quot; or PENCE.

====Genome Sequence Centre====

Throughout the 1980s, Smith and his colleagues at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research advocated for the establishment of a facility that would enable Canada to play a part in what had become known as the Human Genome Project. Eventually, funding was secured from the BC Cancer Agency and in 1999 the Genome Sequence Centre was established with a mandate to develop and deploy genomics technologies in support of the life sciences, and in particular cancer research. The Genome Sciences Centre also provided technology to Genome Canada and Genome BC projects in the areas of human health, the environment, forestry, agriculture, and aquaculture.

===Commercial ventures===
In 1981 Smith ventured into the business world as a pharmaceutical entrepreneur. In collaboration with Professors Earl W. Davie and Benjamin D. Hall of the University of Washington founded ZymoGenetics in Seattle, Washington, US. The company began working on recombinant proteins in an international initiative with Novo Nordisk of Denmark. Recombinant DNA is used mostly in basic research. ZymoGenetics was acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Further applications of recombinant DNA are found in human and veterinary medicine, in agriculture, and in bioengineering.

==Awards and honours==
Smith received many awards in addition to the Nobel Prize, and was known for his generosity. He donated half of the Nobel Prize money to researchers working on the genetics of schizophrenia. The other half he gave to BC Science World and to the Society for Canadian Women in Science and Technology. He received the Royal Bank Award in 1999, and donated the companion grant to the BC Cancer Foundation.

<doc id="199410" wikidata="Q1271916" url="?curid=199410" title="Thin-film transistor">
<text>A thin-film transistor (TFT) is a special type of field-effect transistor (FET) where the transistor is made by thin film deposition. TFTs are grown on a supporting (but non-conducting) substrate, such as glass. This differs from the conventional bulk metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), where the semiconductor material typically &quot;is&quot; the substrate, such as a silicon wafer. The traditional application of TFTs is in TFT liquid-crystal displays.

== Design and manufacture ==
TFTs can be fabricated with a wide variety of semiconductor materials. Because it is naturally abundant and well understood, amorphous or polycrystalline silicon were (and still are) used as the semiconductor layer. However, because of the low mobility of amorphous silicon and the large device-to-device variations found in polycrystalline silicon, other materials have been studied for use in TFTs. These include cadmium selenide, metal oxides such as indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) or zinc oxide, organic semiconductors, carbon nanotubes, or metal halide perovskites.Because TFTs are grown on inert substrates, rather than on wafers, the semiconductor must be deposited in a dedicated process. A variety of techniques are used to deposit semiconductors in TFTs. These include chemical vapor deposition (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), and sputtering. The semiconductor can also be deposited from solution, via techniques such as printing or spray coating. Solution-based techniques are hoped to lead to low-cost, mechanically flexible electronics. Because typical substrates will deform or melt at high temperatures, the deposition process must be carried out under relatively low temperatures compared to traditional electronic material processing.

Some wide band gap semiconductors, most notable metal oxides, are optically transparent. By also employing transparent substrates, such as glass, and transparent electrodes, such as indium tin oxide (ITO), some TFT devices can be designed to be completely optically transparent. Such transparent TFTs (TTFTs) could be used to enable head-up displays (such as on a car windshield).The first solution-processed TTFTs, based on zinc oxide, were reported in 2003 by researchers at Oregon State University. The Portuguese laboratory CENIMAT at the Universidade Nova de Lisboa has produced the world&#x27;s first completely transparent TFT at room temperature. CENIMAT also developed the first paper transistor, which may lead to applications such as magazines and journal pages with moving images.

Many AMOLED displays use LTPO (Low-temperature Poly-Crystalline Silicon and Oxide) TFT transistors. These transistors offer stability at low refresh rates, and variable refresh rates, which allows for power saving displays that do not show visual artifacts. Large OLED displays usually use AOS (amporphous oxide semiconductor) TFT transistors instead, also called oxide TFTs and these are usually based on IGZO.

== Applications ==

The best known application of thin-film transistors is in TFT LCDs, an implementation of liquid-crystal display technology. Transistors are embedded within the panel itself, reducing crosstalk between pixels and improving image stability.

, many color LCD TVs and monitors use this technology. TFT panels are frequently used in digital radiography applications in general radiography. A TFT is used in both direct and indirect capture as a base for the image receptor in medical radiography.

, all modern high-resolution and high-quality electronic visual display devices use TFT-based active matrix displays.

AMOLED displays also contain a TFT layer for active-matrix pixel addressing of individual organic light-emitting diodes.

The most beneficial aspect of TFT technology is its use of a separate transistor for each pixel on the display. Because each transistor is small, the amount of charge needed to control it is also small. This allows for very fast re-drawing of the display.

== History ==
In February 1957, John Wallmark of RCA filed a patent for a thin film MOSFET in which germanium monoxide was used as a gate dielectric. Paul K. Weimer, also of RCA implemented Wallmark&#x27;s ideas and developed the thin-film transistor (TFT) in 1962, a type of MOSFET distinct from the standard bulk MOSFET. It was made with thin films of cadmium selenide and cadmium sulfide. In 1966, T.P. Brody and H.E. Kunig at Westinghouse Electric fabricated indium arsenide (InAs) MOS TFTs in both depletion and enhancement modes.

The idea of a TFT-based liquid-crystal display (LCD) was conceived by Bernard J. Lechner of RCA Laboratories in 1968. Lechner, F.J. Marlowe, E.O. Nester and J. Tults demonstrated the concept in 1968 with an 18x2 matrix dynamic scattering LCD that used standard discrete MOSFETs, as TFT performance was not adequate at the time. In 1973, T. Peter Brody, J. A. Asars and G. D. Dixon at Westinghouse Research Laboratories developed a CdSe (cadmium selenide) TFT, which they used to demonstrate the first CdSe thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display (TFT LCD). The Westinghouse group also reported on operational TFT electroluminescence (EL) in 1973, using CdSe. Brody and Fang-Chen Luo demonstrated the first flat active-matrix liquid-crystal display (AM LCD) using CdSe in 1974, and then Brody coined the term &quot;active matrix&quot; in 1975. However, mass production of this device was never realized, due to complications in controlling the compound semiconductor thin film material properties, and device reliability over large areas.

A breakthrough in TFT research came with the development of the amorphous silicon (a-Si) TFT by P.G. le Comber, W.E. Spear and A. Ghaith at the University of Dundee in 1979. They reported the first functional TFT made from hydrogenated a-Si with a silicon nitride gate dielectric layer. The a-Si TFT was soon recognized as being more suitable for a large-area AM LCD. This led to commercial research and development (R&amp;D) of AM LCD panels based on a-Si TFTs in Japan.

By 1982, pocket TVs based on AM LCD technology were developed in Japan. In 1982, Fujitsu&#x27;s S. Kawai fabricated an a-Si dot-matrix display, and Canon&#x27;s Y. Okubo fabricated a-Si twisted nematic (TN) and guest-host LCD panels. In 1983, Toshiba&#x27;s K. Suzuki produced a-Si TFT arrays compatible with CMOS (complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor) integrated circuits (ICs), Canon&#x27;s M. Sugata fabricated an a-Si color LCD panel, and a joint Sanyo and Sanritsu team including Mitsuhiro Yamasaki, S. Suhibuchi and Y. Sasaki fabricated a 3-inch a-SI color LCD TV.

The first commercial TFT-based AM LCD product was the 2.1-inch Epson ET-10 (Epson Elf), the first color LCD pocket TV, released in 1984. In 1986, a Hitachi research team led by Akio Mimura demonstrated a low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) process for fabricating n-channel TFTs on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI), at a relatively low temperature of 200°C. A Hosiden research team led by T. Sunata in 1986 used a-Si TFTs to develop a 7-inch color AM LCD panel, and a 9-inch AM LCD panel. In the late 1980s, Hosiden supplied monochrome TFT LCD panels to Apple Computer. In 1988, a Sharp research team led by engineer T. Nagayasu used hydrogenated a-Si TFTs to demonstrate a 14-inch full-color LCD display, which convinced the electronics industry that LCD would eventually replace cathode-ray tube (CRT) as the standard television display technology. The same year, Sharp launched TFT LCD panels for notebook PCs. In 1992, Toshiba and IBM Japan introduced a 12.1-inch color SVGA panel for the first commercial color laptop by IBM.

TFTs can also be made out of indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO). TFT-LCDs with IGZO transistors first showed up in 2012, and were first manufactured by Sharp Corporation. IGZO allows for higher refresh rates and lower power consumption. In 2021, the first flexible 32-bit microprocessor was manufactured using IGZO TFT technology on a polyimide substrate.

<text>Master of Reality is the third studio album by English heavy metal band Black Sabbath, released in the United Kingdom on 6 August 1971 by Vertigo Records. It is regarded by some critics as the foundation of doom metal, stoner rock, and sludge metal. Produced by Rodger Bain, who also produced the band&#x27;s prior two albums, &quot;Master of Reality&quot; was recorded at Island Studios in London from February to April 1971. Guitarist Tony Iommi and bassist Geezer Butler downtuned their instruments during the production, achieving what Iommi called a &quot;bigger, heavier sound&quot;.

&quot;Master of Reality&quot; peaked at number five on the UK Albums Chart and number eight on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Though negatively received by critics on release, the album is now considered one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time. It was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) after having sold over two million copies in the US.

==Recording==
&quot;Master of Reality&quot; was recorded at Island Studios in London from February to April 1971. The album was produced by Rodger Bain, who had also produced Black Sabbath&#x27;s previous two albums, with Tom Allom handling engineering. This was to be Bain&#x27;s final collaboration with Black Sabbath as guitarist Tony Iommi took over production for the band&#x27;s next several albums. Drummer Bill Ward explained: &quot;Previously, we didn&#x27;t have a clue what to do in the studio, and relied heavily on Rodger. But this time we were a lot more together, understood what was involved and were more opinionated on how things should be done.&quot;

On the tracks &quot;Children of the Grave&quot;, &quot;Lord of This World&quot;, and &quot;Into the Void&quot;, Iommi downtuned his guitar 1 steps in an effort to reduce string tension, thus making the guitar less painful for him to play. This pain was the result of a factory accident years earlier in which he had the tips of two of his fingers severed. The downtuning also helped the guitarist produce what he called a &quot;bigger, heavier sound&quot;. Geezer Butler also downtuned his bass guitar to match Iommi. &quot;It helped with the sound, too&quot;, Butler explained to &quot;Guitar for the Practicing Musician&quot; in 1994. &quot;Then it got to the point where we tuned even lower to make it easier vocal-wise. But Ozzy (Osbourne) would then sing higher so it sort of defeated the object.&quot;

In the 2013 biography of the band &quot;Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe&quot;, Mick Wall writes that &quot;the Sabbath sound took a plunge into even greater darkness. Bereft even of reverb, leaving their sound as dry as old bones dug up from some desert burial plot, the finished music&#x27;s brutish force would so alarm the critics they would punish Sabbath in print for being blatantly thuggish, purposefully mindless, creepy, and obnoxious. Twenty years later groups like Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden, and, particularly, Nirvana, would excavate the same heaving lung sound ... And be rewarded with critical garlands.&quot; In his autobiography &quot;I Am Ozzy,&quot; vocalist Osbourne states that he cannot remember much about recording &quot;Master of Reality&quot; &quot;apart from the fact that Tony detuned his guitar to make it easier to play, Geezer wrote &#x27;Sweet Leaf&#x27; about all the dope we&#x27;d been smoking, and &#x27;Children of the Grave&#x27; was the most kick-ass song we&#x27;d ever recorded.&quot;

In the liner notes to the 1998 live album &quot;Reunion,&quot; drummer Ward commented that &quot;Master of Reality&quot; was &quot;an exploratory album&quot;. Ward elaborated in a 2016 interview with &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine: &quot;On the first album, we had two days to do everything, and not much more time for &quot;Paranoid&quot;. But now we could take our time, and try out different things. We all embraced the opportunity: Tony threw in classical guitar parts, Geezer&#x27;s bass was virtually doubled in power, I went for bigger bass drums, also experimenting with overdubs. And Ozzy was so much better. But this was the first time when we didn&#x27;t have gigs booked in, and could just focus on making the album a landmark.&quot; In 2013, &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine called &quot;Master of Reality&quot; &quot;The sound of a band becoming increasingly comfortable in their studio surroundings.&quot;

Iommi believes the band might have become too comfortable, however, telling &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 1992, &quot;During &quot;Master of Reality,&quot; we started getting more experimental and began taking too much time to record. Ultimately, I think it really confused us. Sometimes I think I&#x27;d really like to go back to the way we recorded the first two albums. I&#x27;ve always preferred just going into the studio and playing, without spending a lot of time rehearsing or getting sounds.&quot; The song &quot;Into the Void&quot; was especially problematic, with Iommi saying in the same interview: &quot;We tried recording &#x27;Into the Void&#x27; in a couple of different studios because Bill just couldn&#x27;t get it right. Whenever that happened, he would start believing that he wasn&#x27;t capable of playing the song. He&#x27;d say: &#x27;To hell with it – I&#x27;m not doing this!&#x27; There was one track like that on every album, and &#x27;Into the Void&#x27; was the most difficult one on &quot;Master of Reality.&quot;&quot;

In his autobiography &quot;Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven and Hell with Black Sabbath&quot;, Iommi describes the difficulty Osbourne also experienced recording the vocal: &quot;It has this slow bit, but then the riff where Osbourne comes in is very fast. Osbourne had to sing really rapidly: &quot;Rocket engines burning fuel so fast, up into the night sky they blast,&quot; quick words like that. Geezer had written all the words out for him ... Seeing him try was hilarious.&quot; For &quot;Solitude&quot; Iommi played guitar, flute, and piano. A delay effect was later added to Osbourne&#x27;s vocals on the song as a means of doubling the vocal track.

==Composition==
During the album&#x27;s recording sessions, Osbourne brought Iommi a large joint which caused the guitarist to cough uncontrollably. Iommi was recording acoustic guitar parts at the time, and his coughing fit was captured on tape. A fragment of Iommi&#x27;s coughing was later added by producer Bain as the intro to &quot;Sweet Leaf,&quot; a song which was admittedly an ode to marijuana use. Iommi recalls &quot;We all played &#x27;Sweet Leaf&#x27; while stoned.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 2001 Butler recalled: &quot;I do remember writing &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot; in the studio. I&#x27;d just come back from Dublin, and they&#x27;d had these cigarettes called Sweet Afton, which you could only get in Ireland. We were going: &quot;What could we write about?&quot; I took out this cigarette packet, and as you opened it, it&#x27;s got on the lid: &quot;it&#x27;s the sweetest leaf that gives you the taste&quot; I was like: &quot;Ah, Sweet Leaf!&quot; Writing in &quot;Mojo&quot; in 2013, Phil Alexander observed: &quot;To most it is the quintessential stoner anthem, a point borne out by Sabbath&#x27;s own Olympian consumption of hashish during their early days.&quot; In the Black Sabbath concert film &quot;The Last Supper,&quot; Ward ruminates: &quot;Did it enhance the music? Well, you know, we wrote &#x27;Sweet Leaf&#x27;: &#x27;When I first met you / didn&#x27;t realize&#x27;, that&#x27;s about meeting marijuana, having a relationship with marijuana ... That was part of our lifestyle at that time.&quot;

Butler, the band&#x27;s primary lyricist, had a Catholic upbringing, and the song &quot;After Forever&quot; focuses entirely on Christian themes. At the time, Black Sabbath were suspected by some observers of being Satanists due to their dark sound, image, and lyrics. &quot;After Forever&quot; was released as a single along with &quot;Fairies Wear Boots&quot; in 1971.

The first editions of &quot;Master of Reality&quot; came in an &#x27;envelope sleeve&#x27; containing a poster of the band, and with the album&#x27;s title embossed in black lettering, visible in relief. Later editions lacking the embossed printing would render the album title in grey. This was the first Black Sabbath sleeve on which the lyrics were reproduced on the back of the sleeve. In his autobiography Iommi describes the cover as &quot;Slightly Spinal Tap-ish, only well before Spinal Tap&quot;. The labels of the album were different too, as Side A featured the infamous swirl label, although the black circles were white and the white circles black. Side B, which was the information label, was black with white writing instead of white with black writing. That variant of the Vertigo label was never to be used again thereafter.

On the first North American editions of the album, several songs had subtitles given to segments, making it appear that there were more songs than there actually were. The intro of &quot;After Forever&quot; was given the title &quot;The Elegy&quot;, the coda of &quot;Children of the Grave&quot; was called &quot;The Haunting&quot;, the intro of &quot;Lord of This World&quot; was titled &quot;Step Up&quot;, and the intro of &quot;Into the Void&quot; called &quot;Deathmask&quot;. This treatment had also been used on the North American editions of Black Sabbath&#x27;s previous two albums. These pressings also incorrectly listed the album title as &quot;Masters of Reality&quot;. Subsequent editions corrected the album&#x27;s title and removed three of the four subtitles (all but &quot;The Elegy&quot;).

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;Master of Reality&quot; peaked at number five on the UK Albums Chart, and number eight in the United States. It eventually sold two million copies in the US. Despite the album&#x27;s commercial success, it was viewed with disdain by contemporary music critics. In &quot;The Village Voice,&quot; Robert Christgau called it &quot;a dim-witted, amoral exploitation.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Lester Bangs described it as &quot;monotonous&quot; and hardly an improvement over its predecessor, although he found the lyrics more revealing because they offer &quot;some answers to the dark cul-de-sacs of &quot;Paranoid.&quot;&quot;

In 1994, &quot;Master of Reality&quot; was ranked number 28 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;Top 50 Heavy Metal Albums.&quot; Larkin described it as Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;first real international breakthrough&quot; and &quot;a remarkable piece of work&quot;. In &quot;MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide&quot; (1999), authors Gary Graff and Daniel Durcholz described the album as a &quot;brilliant skull crusher&quot;, singling out &quot;Children of the Grave&quot; and &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot; as &quot;timeless&quot;. In 2001, &quot;Q&quot; included it in their list of the 50 Heaviest Albums of All Time, calling it &quot;malevolent ... Casting Black Sabbath as a Titanic-style house band on the eve of Armageddon, cranking it as the bomb drops.&quot; A critic for the magazine cited it as &quot;the most cohesive record of [the band&#x27;s] first three albums.&quot; In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album number 298 in their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, 300 in a 2012 revised list, and 234 in a 2020 revised list. They described the album as representing &quot;the greatest sludge-metal band of them all in its prime.&quot; The same magazine also ranked the album 34th on its &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. Billy Corgan, leader of the Smashing Pumpkins, considered &quot;Master of Reality&quot; the album that &quot;spawned grunge&quot;. Black Sabbath and especially &quot;Master of Reality&quot; was a huge influence of the 1990s stoner rock / Desert Rock scenes in the UK and the US, bands like Kyuss, Monster Magnet, Sleep, and Orange Goblin have cited Sabbath and &quot;Master of Reality&quot; as a defining album of that genre. John Stanier, drummer for Helmet and Tomahawk, cited the record as the one that inspired him to become a musician. In 2013, Sabbath biographer Mick Wall praised Iommi&#x27;s &quot;ability to incorporate more neat riffs and sudden unexpected time changes in one song than most bands would contemplate on an entire album.&quot;

In 2017, Ward ranked &quot;Master of Reality&quot; as his favorite Black Sabbath album that he has ever worked on.

==Track listing==

===Original UK LP Pressing===
All music composed by Black Sabbath (Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ozzy Osbourne, Bill Ward), except &quot;After Forever&quot;, &quot;Embryo&quot; and &quot;Orchid&quot; by Iommi.

===Original US LP Pressing===

Note that, while the overall timing of &quot;Deathmask/Into the Void&quot; is approximately correct, the apportioning of time between the two parts of the song may be arbitrary, as the 3:08 mark occurs during &quot;Into the Void&quot;&#x27;s middle-8 vocal section (&quot;Freedom fighters sent off to the sun ...&quot;). The revised US pressing timings, shown below, compound this likely error.

===Revised US LP Pressing, With Subtitles Removed===

Note that the timing of &quot;Orchid&quot; on revised US pressings is incorrect: it includes the &quot;Step Up&quot; introductory section of &quot;Lord of This World.&quot; The timing of &quot;Solitude&quot; on these pressings is also incorrect, as it includes the first half of &quot;Into the Void&quot;, whereas the timings of &quot;Deathmask&quot; and &quot;Into the Void&quot; from the original US pressing should have been grouped instead.

US-made compact disc pressings of &quot;Master of Reality&quot; continue to list the incorrect timings of the Revised US LP pressing on the CD booklet. However, the songs are not indexed on the CD using those timings – the breaks between songs are correctly placed.

===2009 Deluxe edition===
A two-disc deluxe edition was released in the UK on 29 June 2009 and in the US on 14 July 2009 as an import. This deluxe edition was remastered by Andy Pearce who also did the deluxe editions of &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; and &quot;Paranoid&quot;.


==Personnel==
* Ozzy Osbourne – lead vocals
* Tony Iommi – guitar, synthesiser on &quot;After Forever&quot; and &quot;Children of the Grave&quot;, flute and piano on &quot;Solitude&quot;, acoustic guitar on &quot;Orchid&quot;, cough on &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot;

<text>Choi Seung-hee ( November 24, 1911 – August 8, 1969) was a leading Korean modern dancer. Choi is an important figure of early modern dance in Korea, Japan and China who gained worldwide fame in the 1930s.

== Biography ==
Choi was born into a yangban-class family in Seoul, Korea during the colonial period, and was also known by the Japanese pronunciation of her name, Sai Shōki. Despite the Japanese policy of &quot;Sōshi-kaimei,&quot; a policy of changing Korean names to Japanese names, she retained her Korean family name of Choi. Sai is the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese character for Choi, and was not considered Japanese.The multiple pronunciation of her names shows the existing complex cultural relations within the Japanese Empire. When she was a child, her family faced financial trouble after their lands were taken away by the Japanese. Their only income came from her brother Choi Seung-il&#x27;s manuscripts.

After graduating from Sookmyung High School at the age of fifteen, she tried to become a teacher to help her family financially. She passed seventh amongst 860 applicants, but was rejected due to her age. She was told to return a year later.

Her brother, Choi Seung-il, suggested her to join Baku Ishii to learn the art of dance. Baku Ishii was a prominent Japanese modern dance and ballet dancer (and the father of Kan Ishii who became an actor and a classical composer during the 1940s-1960s). Choi Seung-il was part of the Korea Artist Proletariat Federation (KAPF), and had many connections in both Japan and Korea to journalists and intellectuals. This made it possible for him to connect Choi with Ishii as Ishii also did work for the KAPF. At first Ishii  was hesitant to admit Choi as his student, as he believed that the Korean public did not appreciate dance and thought that their performance resembled that of a traveling circus instead of a respected troupe. However, in 1926, he decided to accept her because he thought her addition would encourage a better relationship between Korea and Japan. She was mesmerized by Baku Ishii&#x27;s performance, especially at his expressions of darkness and torment. Ishii accepted Choi, and even offered to teach her for free and send her to music school. In early 1920s Korea, it was uncommon for a family with conservative Confucian beliefs and ideals to allow for their child to study dance. After Choi gained her parents&#x27; reluctant permission, she left for Japan with Ishii, his wife, his sister, and his students on the next day on March 25, 1926.

Choi was Ishii&#x27;s second Korean student. The first was Kang Hong-shik who left Ishii later and became a movie star under a Japanese name. (The maternal grandson of Kang Hong-shik is Choi Min-soo, who is known as one of the most acclaimed actors in South Korea now). At a time of anti-Korean sentiment heightened by the Korean independence movement and a false rumor that the ethnic Koreans were taking advantage of the 1923 Great Kantō Earthquake to commit violence, which triggered the Kantō Massacre upon the Koreans, Ishii was progressive and open to the Koreans.

Although the dance group performed successfully and brought in a lot of income, they struggled financially because of Ishii&#x27;s debts. He did not have the sufficient salary to give to his dancers. To pay his debts, Ishii lowered the quality of the performances in exchange for quantity. Choi and two Japanese dancers decided to leave the group.

Choi returned to Korea and founded her dancing art institute called the 최승희무용예술연구소. She had both Korean and Japanese students. Upon her return, she was placed in a spotlight because of the political implications and weight of her international work as a Korean dancer. Magazines and newspapers wrote about her Western dance, dancing abroad, and personal life in Korea. The Korean media had a large interest in her work as a dancer and as part of the &quot;new woman&quot; phenomenon. he was particularly subject to media gossip as an unmarried woman. Choi differentiated herself from traditionalism, but also from the new women who specifically identified breaking &quot;jeongjo&quot; (chastity) as a more modern practice. Choi was continuously a  subject to the public&#x27;s backlash, as there were several rumors about her  committing acts of adultery. Despite Choi’s desire to be recognized for developing new dances in Korea, the Korean society only regarded her as part of the &quot;new woman&quot; trend, setting her against the traditional ideal of women. She was seen as an entertainer in the eyes of many Koreans rather than as a modern artist. Choi did not initially intend to study Korean dance at first, as the Korean society did not hold dance to the esteem of fine art; instead, dance was seen as a lowly form of entertainment associated with the &quot;gisaeng&quot; (courtesan).

During this time in Korea, her brother introduced her to his alumni, Ahn Mak (originally named Ahn Pil-seung) a student of Waseda University. The couple married on May 10, 1931. Just three months after their wedding, Ahn Mak was arrested for his connections with Communist sympathizers, and was released on October 15. Ahn Mak went to Tokyo for the winter semester exam. With Ahn&#x27;s permission, Choi funded her institute from money earned from sending Ahn&#x27;s manuscripts to the newspaper companies. Funding was also gained from the sponsorship of The Dong-a Ilbo newspaper company. Choi began to perform Korean folk dances during this time in Korea. Ahn returned temporarily after learning of Choi&#x27;s pregnancy. Their daughter Ahn Seung-ja was born on July 20, 1932. Choi disbanded her institute. Choi became drawn to the Japanese metropolis after a cultural bloom in the 1930s, she found work and artistic opportunities by appealing to Japanese audiences by using colonial traditions. There was also controversy about Choi’s close relationship with the Japanese imperial government. For example, in 1929, the Sookmyung Girl&#x27;s High School as they threatened to deem her a dishonorable alumni in response to her dancing in a Japanese dance troupe. Such a relationship with Japan made her interesting in the public sphere as only seven of her dances were traditionally Korean.

Choi returned to Japan with her daughter and with a student from her disbanded institute, Kim Min-ja. Kim Min-ja wanted to follow Choi to Japan, and she offered to work as Seung-ja&#x27;s nanny. Choi continued to study under Ishii where she distinguished herself as a talented dancer. She developed her own modern dances inspired by Korean folk dances, which had been considered by a lot of the Koreans as lowly works. It was Ishii and Ahn who suggested her to learn the Korean folk dances. Ishii introduced Choi to Han Song-joon who taught Choi more of the Korean dances. At a modern dance competition that was hosted by a monthly magazine 영녀계, Choi performed her Korean dances, one of which she was disguised as a man and artistically imitated her father&#x27;s drunken dance. (After the competition at the end of one of her later performances 풍랑을 헤가르고, she took off her mask of an old man&#x27;s face on stage).

Theater organizations in Japan supported Choi and used her image as a colonial woman. They used femininity and Asian Tradition to create a sense of sensibility and superiority of the empire. The image of femininity was anticipated to play a role in bridging the divide between perceptions of colonized individuals and colonial encounters. As well as, alleviating the Western powers&#x27; hostility towards Japanese militarism in Asia. Choi’s career trajectory and the various spaces in which she performed generated multiple and distinct identities influenced by the desires of the intended audience. The chronological shifts in Choi’s career as well as the national tensions she navigated gave insight to contradictions within the Japanese colonial empire. The portrayal of Choi&#x27;s image coincided with the rapid expansion of media and entertainment during wartime, effectively utilizing Choi&#x27;s fame for political gain. Her work became a tremendously popular cultural phenomenon in Japan at the time, with Japanese imperialism playing a pivotal role in shaping colonial culture.

Choi and Ahn researched historical texts on the forgotten Korean dances. Choi had already seen the sword dances of the shamans and the &quot;kisaengs&quot; in Korea. Choi sought an energetic style. Ahn found texts of ancient Korean militaristic sword dances from a library.

Choi began to work as a model. She used the money that she earned from modelling to fund her performances. She also began to appear in musicals. Ahn used his money that was meant for tuition fees to fund Choi&#x27;s performance.

Ishii continued to have financial problems in 1936. In order to help him, Choi and Ishii&#x27;s six students performed in Taiwan. Their performances in Japan and Taiwan were all successful. Not long after her return from Taiwan, Choi bought a two-story mansion in Tokyo.

Choi was supported by numerous Japanese intellectuals, including Yasunari Kawabata, and corresponded with both Jean Cocteau and Pablo Picasso. She was also a vocalist, and made recordings at Taepyeong Records and Kirin Records (in Manchukuo), before making her 1936 album &quot;Garden of Italy&quot; at Columbia Records Japan.

As Choi earned fame across several countries as well as in the West, several Japanese critics wrote about Choi&#x27;s work. Critics They praised Choi’s work as they believed that she could represent one of the Manchukuo national mottos that called for Five Races under One Union. Japanese critic, Natsuya Mitsuyoshi also acclaimed Choi&#x27;s success at her recital in Shanghai in 1943. He described it as a great representation of Asian people looking to form Great Asia under Japanese Rule. Choi performed as a Japanese dancer yet it was believed she sympathized with Korea and she was esteemed by Koreans. Nevertheless she later received a great deal of criticism in North Korea for assimilating to dancing under the empire.

== Foreign tour ==

Choi was the first female dancer in colonial Korea to perform outside of her country, even though Japan did not allow for dances to express resentment or resistance towards the Japanese Empire.[1]. In 1937 the Japanese military authorities asked Baku Ishii to provide dance performances as entertainment for the Japanese troops after the Sino-Japanese war began. This led Ishii and his dancers to travel around Taiwan, China, and Vietnam with dancers from the Ishii Dance School in Tokyo. Thanks to this tour, Ishii&#x27;s students earned a grand reputation during the time of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945). During this time, dance was not only an artistic performance. Choi’s performance played with the boundaries that are limited by language and dialect. Her performances served as carriers of propaganda across the Japanese empire. Choi’s dance career mainly took place during a time of war as she danced from age 16 to her mid-30s. Because of this, her dance career took place under Japanese imperialism and that influenced the treatment she received from authorities in her country, when living both in South and North Korea. Critics debated the use of Choi’s work to spread propaganda and were concerned with how non-Koreans viewed Korea. Such debate was generated as her work made a different socio-political space. She was unlike other dancers because of her identity as a Korean dancer in a Japanese troupe.

On January 11, 1938, Choi, Ahn, and her pianist Lee Gwang-joon arrived in San Francisco. By this time, Choi and Ahn researched many different traditional dances including the bosal dance (). Choi&#x27;s performances were held in San Francisco (January 22), in Los Angeles (February 2 - Ebell Theatre), and in New York City (February 19). The reactions of the audiences and the reviews were good. In New York City, she watched the performances of the famous Broadway musicians and dancers. In early November 1938, famous people such as Leopold Stokowski, John Steinbeck, Maurice Dekobra, and Charlie Chaplin went to the Guild Theatre (now the August Wilson Theatre) to watch her perform. Because of her use of the Japanese pronunciation of her name when she performed in the United States, she was criticized as a Japanese collaborator by Koreans in the Korean independence movement, but the Japanese government saw her as working for Korean independence, as pro-independence souvenirs were sold at her American shows.

Choi and her group left the United States on December 17, 1938, and they arrived at Le Havre, France on December 24. The performances were held in Paris (January 31, 1939), Brussels (February 6), Cannes (February 26), and Marseille (March 1). They performed in Switzerland during mid-March, and in Italy during late March. Starting from April 1, they performed in the smaller cities of Southern Germany. In mid-April, they performed in the Netherlands. All of Choi&#x27;s performances in Europe received rave reviews. According to Choi&#x27;s letter to her student, her traditional hat (the 초립동 모자) became a fashion trend in Paris. In 1939, in an international dance competition in Brussels, Belgium, Choi was appointed as one of the judges along with Rudolf von Laban, Mary Wigman, Serge Lifar, and Anton Dolin. After this competition, Choi was invited to perform at an international music and dance festival in The Hague, the Netherlands. Afterwards, she performed at the Théâtre national de Chaillot in Paris. The audiences included Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Jean Cocteau, Romain Rolland, and Michel Simon. Picasso sketched a drawing of Choi and gave it to her after her performance.

The people in France were used to the tense situation in Europe that they learned from the newspapers and the radio news. Everyone whom Choi met in France believed that there would not be another world war. Hence, Choi and her group decided to stay despite a warning from the Japanese embassy. She was expecting to perform in Italy, Northern Germany, and Scandinavia. When Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, France declared war on Germany two days later. As the war in Poland raged on, Choi and her group began to evacuate. Their original plan was to evacuate to Italy. This was before Italy joined with Germany and Japan in a Tripartite Pact and before Italy declared war. An employee of the Marseille consulate general warned Choi that Italy might declare war, and that a Japanese ship called the Hakone Maru carrying about 190 Japanese evacuees would arrive the next day from Italy. Choi and her group embarked the Hakone Maru and evacuated to the United States instead. She continued her performing tour in the United States, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, and Mexico.

In 1943, Choi began a series of 130 performances with the goal of comforting soldiers (known as: &quot;tairiku imon) i&quot;n Manchuria, Korea, and northern and central China. Some postcolonial critics in Korea argue that Choi was forced to serve soldiers by the Japanese colonial regime.

== Return to Asia ==
She returned to Japan. Japan changed to total war mode after the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor. All performances needed permission from the Imperial Japanese Army, and to raise troop morale, performing for the military became a requirement. Starting on February 16, 1942, Choi performed for the Japanese armies in Korea, Manchuria, and North China. She performed dances inspired by Korea folk dance as well as Japanese, Chinese, Indian, and Siamese influenced dances. In 1943 she trained in Chinese Opera movement with Meilanfang in Shanghai and in started the Oriental Dance Research Institute in Beiping (now Beijing) in 1944.

On August 15, 1945, Japan surrendered and Korea became liberated. Choi was in China at that time. And she was pregnant. She witnessed the turmoil of the Chinese Civil War. She stayed hidden in fear that she would be accused of being a supporter for Japan. Ahn went to North Korea. Choi went to South Korea. Although she was happy to see her daughter again, she was saddened that South Korean newspapers accused Choi of being a collaborator for Japan. She asked US Lieutenant General John R. Hodge for financial support in her arts, but did not get any further details from him. She went to Rhee Syngman before he was president. He did not have the power to help her.

She went to Pyongyang, North Korea with her husband who was an active supporter of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea. She met the chairman of the North Korean branch of the Korean Communist Party Kim Il Sung before he became the &quot;Great Leader.&quot; This was before Kim had a firm control on North Korea; thus, it was a time before the purges. She found Kim to be very supportive. In those days, Pyongyang was a very small city that had very few artists. Kim Il Sung was fond of plays, and he thought about the political benefits that the public arts could give. He accepted many artists. Choi got her kids to join her from Seoul. Her daughter&#x27;s name was changed to Ahn Sung-hee (). Although Ahn Sung-hee was just a teenager at that time, she already grew tall like her mother, and she already had experience in performing with her. Choi established a dance school and was given an official position within the North Korean administration. On July 25, 1947, Choi sent her daughter, her sister-in-law, and her students to Prague, Czechoslovakia to perform in an international youth dance festival. In December 1949, following the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China she and her dancers including her daughter performed in Beijing for cultural leaders as part of socialist cultural exchange. An Associated Press reporter asked Choi why she did not perform abroad like she used to. Choi replied that she would probably have the chance in the future, but added, &quot;I&#x27;m a bird trapped in a birdcage.&quot;

In May 1950, Choi, her daughter, and about one hundred artists were sent to Moscow to perform. While they were in Moscow on June 25, 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea. Sending the artists was Kim&#x27;s scheme to hide his intention to invade. Earlier, Kim had received permission from Joseph Stalin to invade, and on March 30, 1950, Kim went to Moscow to gain the finalization of Stalin&#x27;s support for Kim&#x27;s war. Kim received T-34-85 tanks, artillery, military planes, and his reinforced army exceeded South Korea&#x27;s three to one. After Moscow, they performed in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), Kyiv, and Novosibirsk. The Korean War was raging on when they returned to Korea. In October 1950, Choi, her son, and her students evacuated to China where they performed. Their daughter rejoined them later after being separated away during the war.

=== Chinese Classical Dance ===
Choi was influential in the development of Chinese Classical Dance and of Chinese-Korean Dance (N.E. China has a Korean minority), leading a project to pull the dance elements out of Chinese Opera. Upon returning to Beijing Choi worked with Chinese Opera performers Mei Lanfang, Han Shichang and Bai Yunsheng to analyze the movement in Chinese Opera as source elements for the development of Chinese classical dance. Chinese dance artist and director of the CAD Dance Ensemble, Chen Jinqing, identified Choi&#x27;s work as a model for the field of Chinese dance as it took local folk material and elevated it using modern choreographic techniques. In January 1951 The Chinese Ministry of Culture invited Choi to move her dance institute to Beijing. On March 15, 1951, Choi opened her dance academy in Beijing. She was required to add Chinese dances to her curriculum. Her program is credited with introducing a way of categorizing folk dance and classical dance, that was focused on the source of the material and not the age of the material. Folk dances were those that had been performed by often rural peasants, while classical dances were those that built on Chinese Opera movement. This continues to be a major way of classifying dance in China today. She was well known by the Chinese dancers of that time as someone who deeply influenced the way the Beijing opera was taught.

In July 1951, Choi brought her dance group to Moscow to perform. Starting on August 5, her students including her daughter performed in East Germany. Afterwards, Choi and her group performed in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria. In that same year, she was asked to visit Beijing to perform for Chinese premier Zhou Enlai. She returned to North Korea when the war was still raging on. After the Korean Armistice Agreement, Choi established her dance academy () in Pyongyang. She sent her daughter to study in The Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Moscow.

On February 25, 1955, North Korea&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nam Il announced the need to normalize relations with other countries for peace regardless of the social system. (Nam Il was formerly the General of the Army during the Korean War). He proposed an economic and cultural exchange with Japan. Ten Japanese peace delegates visited North Korea in May of that year. The delegates included Ashihei Hino, a famous writer. In Japan at that time, there was a movement to invite Choi to Japan. After the delegates&#x27; visit, more Japanese including Koreya Senda, Jukichi Uno, and Tomoyoshi Murayama met Choi in Pyongyang. The government and Ahn Mak feared that Choi would not return from Japan if she performed there. They did not allow Choi to leave for Japan.

There was a power struggle beneath Kim Il Sung between Kim Chang-man and Han Sul-ya in which Han&#x27;s side lost. A purge followed. Ahn Mak was Han Sul-ya&#x27;s right-hand man. Ahn was arrested in April 1959.

In 1967, she was purged by the party, and disappeared from public view. In October 1999, a defector named Kim Yong said that Choi was imprisoned in the same concentration camp (18호 관리소) that he was in. On February 9, 2003, an official announcement was made that she had died in 1969, and a monument was constructed proclaiming her a &quot;People&#x27;s Actress&quot;.

== Fashion Styles ==
 Choi’s fashion styles reflected a blend of traditional Korean aesthetics and Western modernity. She often incorporated traditional elements such as hanbok into her performances, but adapted them with contemporary cuts and fabrics, showcasing her unique interpretation of Korean identity. Her fashion choices not only highlighted her artistic expression but also symbolized the broader cultural shifts occurring in Korea during that period, as women began embracing modern styles while navigating the complexities of national identity and modernity. Choi&#x27;s Western fashion styles showcased a blend of elegance and modernity, reflecting the fashion trends of the 1930s and 1940s. Her outfits often featured tailored blouses paired with long skirts, emphasizing a sophisticated silhouette. She complimented her ensembles with luxurious fur coats, which added a touch of glamour and warmth. Choi was known for accessorizing with stylish hats, which were popular at the time and served to enhance her chic appearance. Additionally, her choice of pointed-toe shoes added a fashionable edge, emphasizing the elongated lines of her outfits. This combination of Western elements with her unique artistic flair contributed to her status as a fashion icon among the &quot;Modern Girls&quot; of Korea.

<text>Arbusto Energy was an oil and gas exploration firm started in 1977 by former U.S. president George W. Bush. In 1984, the company merged with Spectrum 7 Energy Corp.

==History==
Arbusto Energy was organized in 1977, but did not begin operations until after Bush&#x27;s unsuccessful 1978 run for Representative from Texas&#x27;s 19th congressional district. In March 1979, the company began raising funds for oil exploration through private offerings. In April 1982, Bush decided to begin offering public drilling partnerships, but had difficulty raising subscriptions. A change in the company name to &quot;Bush Exploration&quot; brought no improvement. With little success in its drilling program, the company merged with Spectrum 7 Energy Corp. in February 1984, with Bush holding the positions of Chairman and CEO. In 1986, a rapid fall in oil prices made investment in oil exploration unattractive, and put the company in financial difficulties. Spectrum 7 began looking for partners or purchasers, and in September of that year it was acquired by Harken Energy through a stock swap, with Bush joining the Harken board of directors.

From 1981–1986 the chief financial officer of Arbusto Energy was Mike Conaway. Conaway served as the U.S. representative for from 2005–2021.

==Arbusto and James Bath==
One of the early investors in Arbusto was Houston businessman James R. Bath. Bath and Bush became acquainted when both men were serving as reserve pilots in the Texas Air Guard in the early 1970s, and according to journalist Craig Unger, Bath invested $50,000 in Arbusto.

At the time of the investment, Bath was a representative for Saudi businessman Salem bin Laden, the oldest son of Mohammed bin Laden and the older brother of Osama bin Laden, founder of the Saudi Binladin Group, the largest oil construction company in Saudi Arabia. Bath&#x27;s business partner Charles White later became involved in a legal dispute with Bath, during which he claimed that Bath had actually invested in the company on behalf of bin Laden and other Saudi businessmen. Both Bath and Bush have denied this, and according to journalist Craig Unger, who examined the relationship between the Bushes and Saudi financiers in his 2004 book &quot;House of Bush, House of Saud&quot;, and journalist Steve Coll, whose book &quot;The Bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century&quot; examines the family&#x27;s history, there is no evidence to support the claim.

<text>USS &quot;Langley&quot; (CV-1/AV-3) was the United States Navy&#x27;s first aircraft carrier, converted in 1920 from the collier USS &quot;Jupiter&quot; (Navy Fleet Collier No. 3), and also the US Navy&#x27;s first turbo-electric-powered ship. &quot;Langley&quot; was named after Samuel Langley, an American aviation pioneer. She was the sole member of her class to be rebuilt as a carrier. Conversion of another collier was planned but canceled when the Washington Naval Treaty required the cancellation of the partially built s &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot;, freeing up their hulls for conversion to the aircraft carriers and . Following another conversion to a seaplane tender, &quot;Langley&quot; saw service in World War II. On 27 February 1942, while ferrying a cargo of USAAF P-40s to Java, she was attacked by nine twin-engine Japanese bombers of the Japanese 21st and 23rd naval air flotillas and so badly damaged that she had to be scuttled by her escorts.

==Construction==
President William H. Taft attended the ceremony when &quot;Jupiter&quot;″s keel was laid down on 18 October 1911, at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California. She was launched on 24 August 1912, sponsored by Mrs. Thomas F. Ruhm; and commissioned on 7 April 1913, under Commander Joseph M. Reeves. Her sister ships were , which disappeared without a trace in World War I, , and , both of which disappeared on the same route as &quot;Cyclops&quot; in World War II.

&quot;Jupiter&quot; was the first turbo-electric-powered ship of the US Navy. had been built with a steam turbine and geared drive but performance was inferior to the earlier &quot;Cyclops&quot; with its two triple expansion steam engines. &quot;Jupiter&quot;″s electric drive, designed by William Le Roy Emmet and built by the General Electric Company, consisted of two electric motors, each directly connected to a propeller shaft, powered by a single Curtis turbine and alternator set. At 2,000 rpm and 2,200 volts the set delivered a speed of with propellers at 110 rpm. There was also a weight saving with the turbo-electric drive being 156 tons versus the 280 tons of equivalent machinery for &quot;Cyclops&quot;.

==Service history==
===Collier===
After successfully passing her sea trial &quot;Jupiter&quot; embarked a United States Marine Corps detachment at San Francisco, California, and reported to the Pacific Fleet at Mazatlán, Mexico, on 27 April 1914, bolstering US naval strength on the Mexican Pacific coast in the tense days of the Veracruz crisis. She remained on the Pacific coast until she departed for Philadelphia, on 10 October. &quot;En route&quot;, the collier steamed through the Panama Canal on Columbus Day, the first vessel to transit it from the Pacific to the Atlantic.

Prior to America&#x27;s entry into World War I, she cruised the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, attached to the Atlantic Fleet Auxiliary Division. The ship arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 6 April 1917, and was assigned to the Naval Overseas Transport Service, interrupted her coaling operations by two cargo voyages to France, in June 1917 and November 1918. The first voyage transported a naval aviation detachment of 7 officers and 122 men to England. It was the first US aviation detachment to arrive in Europe and was commanded by Lieutenant Kenneth Whiting, who became &quot;Langley&quot; first executive officer five years later. &quot;Jupiter&quot; was back in Norfolk, on 23 January 1919, whence she sailed for Brest, France, on 8 March, for coaling duty in European waters to expedite the return of victorious veterans to the United States. Upon reaching Norfolk, on 17 August, the ship was transferred to the West Coast. Her conversion to an aircraft carrier was authorized on 11 July 1919, and she sailed to Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 12 December, where she was decommissioned on 24 March 1920.

===Aircraft carrier===
&quot;Jupiter&quot; was converted into the first US aircraft carrier at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia. On 11 April 1920, she was renamed &quot;Langley&quot; in honor of Samuel Pierpont Langley, an American astronomer, physicist, aeronautics pioneer and aircraft engineer, and she was given the hull number &quot;CV-1&quot;. By early 1921, memories of World War I were swaying public opinion away from warship construction toward disarmament. Article VIII of the Washington Naval Treaty provided an exemption for experimental aircraft carriers in existence or building on 12 November 1921. The Washington Naval Treaty was signed on 6 February 1922; and &quot;Langley&quot; was recommissioned on 20 March 1922 for the purpose of conducting experiments in seaborne aviation. The commanding officer was Commander Kenneth Whiting, who had first proposed conversion of a collier to the General Board of the United States Navy three years earlier. &quot;Langley&quot; was designed to carry up to 34 airplanes, e.g., 12 single-seaters, 12 two-seaters, and 10 “torpedo-dropping” aircraft. 

As the first American aircraft carrier, &quot;Langley&quot; was the scene of several seminal events in US naval aviation. On 17 October 1922, Lt. Virgil C. Griffin piloted the first plane—a Vought VE-7—launched from her full-length wooden deck. Though this was not the first time an airplane had taken off from a ship, and though &quot;Langley&quot; was not the first ship with an installed flight deck, this one launching was of monumental importance to the modern US Navy. With &quot;Langley&quot; underway nine days later, Lieutenant Commander Godfrey de Courcelles Chevalier made the first landing, in an Aeromarine 39B. On 18 November, Commander Whiting was the first aviator to be catapulted from a carrier&#x27;s deck.

An unusual feature of &quot;Langley&quot; was provision for a carrier pigeon house on the stern between the 5-inch guns. Pigeons had been carried aboard seaplanes for message transport since World War I, and were to be carried on aircraft operated from &quot;Langley&quot;. The pigeons were trained at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard while &quot;Langley&quot; was undergoing conversion. As long as the pigeons were released a few at a time for exercise, they returned to the ship; but when the whole flock was released while &quot;Langley&quot; was anchored off Tangier Island, the pigeons flew south and roosted in the cranes of the Norfolk shipyard. The pigeons never went to sea again and the former pigeon house became the executive officer&#x27;s quarters; but the early plans for conversion of &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot; included compartments for pigeons.

By 15 January 1923, &quot;Langley&quot; had begun flight operations and tests in the Caribbean Sea for carrier landings. In June, she steamed to Washington, D.C., to give a demonstration at a flying exhibition before civil and military dignitaries. She arrived at Norfolk on 13 June, and commenced training along the Atlantic coast and Caribbean which carried her through the end of the year. This publicity cruise stopped at Bar Harbor, Maine, Portland, Maine, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Gloucester, Massachusetts, Boston and New York City. After entering port and anchoring, &quot;Langley&quot; published a takeoff and landing schedule so interested civilians might watch. Although the aviators did some formation flying over the cities, people were more interested in watching the shipboard takeoffs and landings. The planes seldom attained flying speed on deck when taking off while the ship was at anchor with little or no wind, but the pilots were confident their Vought VE-7s could reach flying speed during the drop from the flight deck before reaching the water. In 1924, &quot;Langley&quot; participated in more maneuvers and exhibitions, and spent the summer at Norfolk for repairs and alterations, she departed for the West Coast late in the year and arrived in San Diego, California, on 29 November to join the Pacific Battle Fleet.

Captain Joseph Mason &quot;Bull&quot; Reeves, who commanded all fleet aircraft, went aboard the &quot;Langley&quot; in October 1925. During the 1925 maneuvers aboard the Langley, Reeves developed dive-bombing tactics to attack enemy ships. 

In 1927, &quot;Langley&quot; was at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. For the next 12 years, she operated off the California coast and Hawaii, engaged in training fleet units, experimentation, pilot training, and tactical-fleet problems. &quot;Langley&quot; was featured in the 1929 silent film about naval aviation &quot;The Flying Fleet.&quot;

===Seaplane tender===
On 25 October 1936, she put into Mare Island Navy Yard, California for overhaul and conversion to a seaplane tender. Though her career as a carrier had ended, her well-trained pilots had proved invaluable to the next two carriers, &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot; (commissioned on 14 December and 16 November 1927, respectively).

&quot;Langley&quot; completed conversion on 26 February 1937 and was assigned hull number &quot;AV-3&quot; on 11 April. She was assigned to the Aircraft Scouting Force and commenced her tending operations out of Seattle, Washington, Sitka, Alaska, Pearl Harbor, and San Diego, California. She departed for a brief deployment with the Atlantic Fleet from 1 February-10 July 1939, and then steamed to assume duties with the Asiatic Fleet at Manila arriving on 24 September.

===World War II===
On the entry of the US into World War II, &quot;Langley&quot; was anchored off Cavite, Philippines. On 8 December, following the invasion of the Philippines by Japan, she departed Cavite for Balikpapan in the Dutch East Indies. In the natural state of alarm (the attack on Pearl Harbor had happened the day before) 300 rounds were shot at an object in the sky before it was realized that it was the planet Venus. As the Japanese advance continued, &quot;Langley&quot; proceeded to Australia, arriving in Darwin on 1 January 1942. She then became part of the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM) naval forces. Until 11 January, &quot;Langley&quot; assisted the Royal Australian Air Force in running anti-submarine patrols from Darwin.

&quot;Langley&quot; went to Fremantle to pick up a cargo of 32 P-40 fighters of the Far East Air Force&#x27;s 13th Pursuit Squadron (Provisional), along with U.S. Army Air Force (USAAF) pilots and ground crews. At Fremantle, &quot;Langley&quot; and the cargo ship (loaded with an additional 27 unassembled and crated P-40s), joined Convoy MS.5 which had just arrived from Melbourne bound for Colombo, Ceylon with troops and supplies eventually destined for India and Burma. The convoy was composed of the United States Army Transport and the Australian troop transports and , escorted by the light cruiser . MS.5 departed Fremantle on 22 February. En route to Colombo, &quot;Langley&quot; and &quot;Sea Witch&quot; were directed by ABDACOM to leave the convoy and instead proceed individually to deliver the planes to Tjilatjap, Java.

In the early hours of 27 February, &quot;Langley&quot; rendezvoused with the destroyers and , which had been sent from Tjilatjap to escort her. Later that morning, a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft located the formation. At 11:40, about south of Tjilatjap, the seaplane tender, along with &quot;Edsall&quot; and &quot;Whipple&quot; were attacked by sixteen Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot; bombers of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service&#x27;s Takao Kōkūtai, led by Lieutenant Jiro Adachi, flying out of Denpasar airfield on Bali, and escorted by fifteen A6M2 Reisen fighters. Rather than dropping all their bombs at once, the Japanese bombers attacked releasing partial salvos. Since they were level bombing from medium altitude, &quot;Langley&quot; was able to alter helm when the bombs were released and evade the first and second bombing passes, but the bombers changed their tactics on the third pass and bracketed all the directions &quot;Langley&quot; could turn. As a result, &quot;Langley&quot; took five hits from a mix of bombs as well as three near misses, with 16 crewmen killed. The topside burst into flames, steering was impaired, and the ship developed a 10° list to port. &quot;Langley&quot; went dead in the water as her engine room flooded. At 13:32, the order to abandon ship was passed.

After taking off the surviving crew and passengers (&quot;Whipple&quot; rescued 308 men and &quot;Edsall&quot; 177) at 13:58, the escorting destroyers stood off and began firing nine shells and two torpedoes into &quot;Langley&quot; hull at 14:29 to prevent her from falling into enemy hands, scuttling her at approximately . After being transferred to the oiler , many of &quot;Langley&quot;″s crew were lost when &quot;Pecos&quot; was sunk en route to Australia by Japanese carrier aircraft. Out of over 630 total crewmen and &quot;Langley&quot; survivors on &quot;Pecos&quot;, 232 were rescued while more than 400 were left behind and died due to Japanese submarines in the area hindering rescue efforts. Exact casualty numbers for the doomed ships of the United States Asiatic Fleet and American-British-Dutch-Australian Command are impossible to gather because so many Allied warships were sunk in the Dutch East Indies campaign (at least 24 total) and many of those ships had already picked up survivors of other sunken ships and then were also sunk by the Japanese hours or days later. Thirty-one of the thirty-three pilots assigned to the USAAF 13th Pursuit Squadron (Provisional) being transported by &quot;Langley&quot; remained on &quot;Edsall&quot; to be brought to Tjilatjap, but were lost when she was sunk on the same day by Japanese warships while responding to the distress calls of &quot;Pecos&quot;. According to the Bureau of Naval Personnel a total of 288 U.S. Navy officers and crewmen from &quot;Langley&quot; were missing in action and later declared dead following the sinking of &quot;Langley&quot; and &quot;Pecos&quot;. Including the 31 USAAF pilots that were originally on &quot;Langley&quot; a total of 319 from &quot;Langley&quot; were killed.

==Awards and decorations==


USS &quot;Langley&quot; (as AV-3) earned two battle stars on its Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Streamer: One for the Philippine Islands Operation, 8 December 1941 – 6 May 1942; and one for Netherlands East Indies Engagements, 23 January – 27 February 1942.

<text>A campaign is a continuing storyline in a game. In role-playing games, it is a set of adventures. In video games, it may be a linked series of quests designed to tell a complete story.

== In role-playing games ==
A campaign in a tabletop role-playing game is characterized by the following:
* Rules – What underlying game system is used? What changes, additions, or subtractions has the game master made to the rules? How will the game master interpret those rules?
* Setting – Where do the adventures take place? What makes this world or place unique?
* Realism – Will the game try to closely simulate the real world? Or will unlikely or fantastic happenings be commonplace?
* Humor – Will the game be silly or comical? Or will it be serious and dark?
* Plot – Are the players a part of larger events? Not all campaigns have such a storyline, but most at least have recurring characters. Differing emphasis on these factors sets the flavor of the campaign. A campaign, its characters, the settings, and its history, are created by players and the game master collaboratively .

== In video games ==
Campaigns with deep stories are typically found in single-player video games. Cooperative multiplayer video games may also have campaigns where players assist each other with a series of challenges or goals. Progressing through them together provides a coherent story. Campaigns in video games often incorporate cutscenes to tell the story, breaking up the game into alternating interactive and non-interactive sequences. In open world video games, campaigns usually consist of a series of linked quests that require players to travel to specific locations to continue the story. Players who dislike being forced to travel and complete specific quests may ignore the main story. In this sense, campaigns are the game&#x27;s main story, as opposed to side quests. Heavily scripted video games that force players to progress linearly through the story may be called &quot;on rails&quot;.

== Styles ==
* A &quot;hack and slash&quot;, &quot;kick in the door&quot;, or &quot;dungeon crawl&quot; campaign focuses on slaying monsters and finding treasure. This type of campaign is often very episodic. Many players of Dungeons &amp; Dragons favor this type of campaign.
* A &quot;wargame&quot; campaign focuses on military and political activities, generally involving the affairs of fictional states. Miniature wargaming overlaps with role playing. Games Workshop started as a roleplay company, but through an analogous process, have transformed themselves into a miniatures manufacturing company with support material for entire fictional worlds – all to support their own role/miniature campaign concepts.
* A &quot;four color&quot; or &quot;superheroic&quot; campaign resembles comic books. Players are often given tasks, such as stopping supervillains, by their superiors.
* A &quot;detective&quot; campaign focuses on mysteries that must be solved by the players or that unfold as the game goes along. These may be ordinary crimes or paranormal mysteries. Some games, such as Call of Cthulhu, are designed specifically with supernatural campaigns in mind.
* Numerous variants of the above campaigns are created by the players. The exact nature of these variations are usually exposed by providing a descriptive prefix to the word campaign. For example: a villain campaign where the players are the bad guys or a kiddie campaign where the players&#x27; characters are still children.

== Other names ==
Some published games have deliberately used different terms for the same concept. For instance, White Wolf uses the word &quot;Chronicle&quot; for its World of Darkness and Exalted games. The Lego Group simply uses the word &quot;Story&quot; for its Lego video games.

<text>The historical provinces (, singular &quot;historiallinen maakunta&quot;, ) are former administrative or cultural areas of Finland, with origins from the slottslän (&quot;)&quot; of the Middle Ages. The historical provinces ceased to be administrative entities in 1634 when they were superseded by the counties, a reform which remained in force in Finland until 1997. The historical provinces remain as a tradition, but have no administrative function today.The first name in the parentheses is the Finnish name and the second is the Swedish one.

== History ==

Most of the historical provinces are defined by slottslän (&quot;)&quot;, which was an administrative system established by Birger Jarl and King Magnus III of Sweden. The historical provinces which can be defined by slottslän are Åland (), Finland Proper (), Satakunta (), Uusimaa ( and ), Karelia (), Häme (), Ostrobothnia () and Savo ().

The administrative system was replaced in 1634, when the historical provinces and slottslän were replaced by provinces. Even after this, names of the historical provinces were used for the names of the counties, and also as the basis for the territorial definition of the counties. The old symbols of the historical provinces continued to exist in the coats of arms of the counties. 

The historical provinces gained a new meaning as part of the national awakening in the 19th century. Such as in Zacharias Topelius&#x27; &quot;Maamme&quot;, where the Finnish tribes based on historical provinces and their perceived stereotypes played a central role in the book. 

== Heraldry ==

At the funeral of King Gustav Vasa in 1560, the coats of arms for the provinces were displayed together for the first time and several of them had been granted for that particular occasion. After the separation of Finland from Sweden in 1809 the traditions for the provincial arms have somewhat diverged. Finland maintains the distinction between ducal and comital dignity shown in the coronets for arms of the historical provinces, while all the Swedish provinces have carried the Swedish style ducal coronet since 1884. The division of Lapland also necessitated a distinction between the Finnish and the Swedish coats of arms.

The coats of arms of the historical provinces have served as a basis for the arms of the current administrative divisions, the regions of Finland.

<text>The Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) for communicable diseases in the European Union was created by the European Commission to &quot;ensure a rapid and effective response by the EU to events (including emergencies) related to communicable diseases.&quot;


== Brexit and COVID-19 ==
In 2020, the Department of Health and Social Care requested that the United Kingdom should keep its access to the EWRS after Brexit in order to combat the global COVID-19 outbreak. This was supported by numerous medical experts and organizations, with Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, stating that EWRS access was essential to maintain the best possible response. The request was denied by Boris Johnson&#x27;s government for political reasons, to preserve the government&#x27;s bargaining position in post-Brexit negotiations.

<text>The Traffic and Environmental Zone, commonly known as the &quot;ring of steel&quot;, is the security and surveillance cordon consisting of road barriers, checkpoints and several hundred CCTV cameras surrounding the City of London, the financial district at the heart of Greater London. The measures have been used since the 1990s to deter terrorism and other threats.

==History and purpose==
===Introduction===
The &quot;ring of steel&quot; measures were introduced by Owen Kelly, then the City of London Police commissioner, following the Provisional IRA bombing campaign in London in the 1980s and early 1990s including attacks within the City such as the 1992 Baltic Exchange and 1993 Bishopsgate attacks. The &quot;Traffic and Environmental Zone&quot; was officially established in 1993.

The term &quot;ring of steel&quot; was borrowed from an earlier stage of the Troubles when the centre of Belfast was fortified against attacks; this fortified perimeter was also known as the &quot;ring of steel&quot;.

Roads entering the City were narrowed and small chicanes were created to force drivers to slow down and be recorded by CCTV cameras. These roads typically had a concrete traffic island with a sentry box where police could stand guard and monitor traffic. City planners call these types of precautions &quot;fortress urbanism&quot;. Some roads were closed to traffic entirely. Despite the term &quot;ring of steel&quot;, the roadblocks and chicanes were actually created with concrete blocks, sometimes plastic coated, that were wedged together.

Initially the sentry posts were staffed by armed police almost continuously. The ring of steel consisted of plastic cones and on-duty police officers which the locals described as the &quot;ring of plastic&quot;. It served the purpose of providing a visible sign to the public that the City authorities were taking the threats of more attacks by the IRA seriously. This was replaced by more permanent structures consisting of concrete barriers, checkpoints and hundreds of video cameras. Following IRA ceasefires the police presence was curtailed.

=== Attacks outside the ring ===
In 1996, the IRA attacked another area of central London by exploding a bomb at the Docklands, resulting in two deaths, 39 other casualties and £85 million worth of damage. The attack showed that even if the TEZ were able to hinder attacks inside the City itself, terrorists could instead target other high-value areas such as the Docklands or Westminster.

=== Late 1990s step down ===
Staffed checkpoints began to be phased out after the IRA announced a ceasefire in 1994 and were no longer used after the 1990s.

=== Early 2000s step up ===
Following the September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001, and a reported increased terrorist threat to the United Kingdom, security was stepped up with occasional spot checks on vehicles entering the cordon, although not to previous levels. In December 2003, the ring of steel was widened to include more businesses in the City. This was as a direct result of a police report that categorised a terrorist attack on the City as &quot;inevitable&quot;. Traffic entering the City is also monitored and recorded at the boundary of the London congestion charging zone, which covers a wider area.

===2016 proposals===
Re-introduction of staffed checkpoints, restricted roads, as well as rising street bollards and crash-proof barricades were proposed in December 2016 to combat &quot;hostile vehicle-borne security threat[s]&quot;. The proposals were initially to be implemented by 2022, but as of 2024, no new construction has taken place. 

== Number of CCTV cameras ==
According to a 2011 Freedom of Information Act request, the total number of local government operated CCTV cameras in the City of London was 649.

The number of surveillance cameras that are part of the TEZ is often wrongly quoted as 500,000. This figure relates to Greater London, which has an area of 607 sq. mi. (1,572 square km) compared with the square mile (3 square km) of the City of London that the ring of steel covers. Furthermore, it has been acknowledged for several years that the methodology behind this figure is flawed, but it has been widely quoted.

The figure of 500,000 comes from a study by Michael McCahill and Clive Norris of UrbanEye published in 2002. Based on a small sample in Putney High Street, McCahill and Norris extrapolate the number of surveillance cameras in Greater London to be 500,000 and in the United Kingdom to be 4.2 million. More reliable estimates put the total number of private and local government surveillance cameras in the whole of the United Kingdom at around 1.85 million in 2011.

<doc id="199437" wikidata="Q998676" url="?curid=199437" title="Book lung">
<text>A book lung is a type of respiration organ used for atmospheric gas-exchange that is present in many arachnids, such as scorpions and spiders. Each of these organs is located inside an open, ventral-abdominal, air-filled cavity (atrium) and connects with its surroundings through a small opening for the purpose of respiration.

==Structure and function==

Book lungs are not related to the lungs of modern land-dwelling vertebrates. Their name instead describes their structure and purpose as a case of convergent evolution. Stacks of alternating air pockets and tissue filled with hemolymph give them an appearance similar to a &quot;folded&quot; book.

Their number varies from just one pair in most spiders to four pairs in scorpions. The unfolded &quot;pages&quot; (plates) of the book lung are filled with hemolymph. The folds maximize the surface exposed to air, and thereby maximize the amount of gas exchanged with the environment. In most species, no motion of the plates is needed to facilitate this kind of respiration.

===Occasionally absent===
Many arachnids, such as mites and harvestmen, have no traces of book lungs and breathe through tracheae or through their body-surfaces only. Gas exchange is performed by the thin walls inside the cavity instead, with their surface area increased by branching into the body as thin tubes called tracheae. These tracheae may possibly have evolved directly from book lungs because the tracheae in some spiders have a small number of greatly elongated chambers.

==Arachnid taxonomy==
The absence or presence of book lungs divides the Arachnida into two main groups:

; The pulmonate arachnids
: book lungs present; Tetrapulmonata (whip scorpions, Schizomida, Amblypygi, and spiders) and scorpions
; The a-pulmonate arachnids
: book lungs absent; microwhip scorpions, harvestmen, Acarina, pseudoscorpions, Ricinulei, and sunspiders

Tetrapulmonata have two pairs of book lungs found on the second and third abdominal segments (Schizomida have lost a pair, and most advanced spiders have replaced at least one of the pairs with trachea). Scorpions have four pairs of book lungs, found on abdominal segments number three, four, five, and six.

The pulmonate arachnids also appears to be the only members of Arachnida where the respiratory pigment hemocyanin is present in their blood.

One of the long-running controversies in arachnid evolution is whether the book lung evolved from book gills just once in a common arachnid ancestor, or whether book lungs evolved separately in several groups of arachnids as they came onto land. While the third abdominal segment in Tetrapulmonata have book lungs, the scorpions have a pair of sensory organs called pectines instead.

The oldest book lungs have been recovered from extinct trigonotarbid arachnids preserved in the 410 million-year-old Rhynie chert of Scotland. These Devonian fossil lungs are almost indistinguishable from the lungs of modern arachnids, fully adapted to a terrestrial existence.

==Book gills==
Book lungs are thought to have evolved from book gills, water-breathing structures among marine chelicerates. Although they have a similar book-like structure, book gills are external, while book lungs are internal. Both are considered appendages rather than conventional internal organs, as they develop from limb buds before the buds flatten into segmented lamellae. 

Book gills are still present in the marine arthropod &quot;Limulus&quot; (horseshoe crabs) which have five pairs of them, the flap in front of them being the genital operculum which lacks gills. Book gills are flap-like appendages that effect gas exchange within water and seem to have their origin as modified legs. On the inside of each appendage, over 100 thin page-like membranes, &quot;lamellae&quot;, appearing as pages in a book, are where gas exchange takes place. These appendages move rhythmically to drive blood in and out of the lamellae and to circulate water over them. Respiration being their main purpose, they can also be used for swimming in young individuals. If they are kept moist, the horseshoe crab can live on land for many hours.

<doc id="199438" wikidata="Q560067" url="?curid=199438" title="Roger Delgado">
<text>Roger Caesar Marius Bernard de Delgado Torres Castillo Roberto (1 March 1918 – 18 June 1973) was an English actor. He played many roles on television, radio and in films, and had &quot;a long history of playing minor villains&quot; before becoming best known as the first actor to play the Master in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (1971–73).

== Early life ==
Delgado was born in Whitechapel, in the East End of London, to a Belgian mother and a Spanish father; he often remarked to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; co-star and close friend Jon Pertwee that this made him a true Cockney, as he was born within the sound of Bow Bells. He did not live in the East End, but was brought up in Bedford Park in west London. 

He attended Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School, a Roman Catholic secondary school in Holland Park, and the London School of Economics for a brief period but did not complete his degree. He served in the Second World War with both the Leicestershire Regiment and the Royal Corps of Signals, attaining the rank of major.

== Career ==
Delgado worked extensively on the British stage, and on television, film and radio. His theatre debut was in 1939 and his first television appearance was 1948. He appeared in the BBC Television serial &quot;Quatermass II&quot; (1955), the Powell and Pressburger wartime drama &quot;Battle of the River Plate&quot; (1956), and came to wide popular attention in Britain when he played the duplicitous Spanish envoy Mendoza in the ITC Entertainment series, &quot;Sir Francis Drake,&quot; from 1961 to 1962, after which he was in much demand. An in-joke in the 1971 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Colony in Space&quot; refers to that role, when the Brigadier tells the Doctor not to worry as the suspected sighting of the Master &quot;was only the Spanish Ambassador&quot;. Delgado was frequently cast as a villain, appearing in many British action-adventure TV series by ITC, including &quot;Danger Man&quot; (1961), &quot;The Saint&quot; (1962 and 1966), &quot;The Champions&quot; (1969), and &quot;Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot; (1969).

Delgado made a total of 16 guest appearances in ITC shows, the most of any actor, with his last completed role being ITC&#x27;s &quot;The Zoo Gang&quot; (1974). He also appeared in &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1961 and 1969), &quot;The Power Game&quot; (1966), and an &quot;ITV Play of the Week&quot; (&quot;The Crossfire&quot;, 1967). His films included &quot;The Terror of the Tongs&quot;, &quot;The Road to Hong Kong&quot;, &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Shroud&quot; and &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;. He began work as The Master on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in late 1970, his first broadcast appearance being in the January 1971 adventure &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot;. He subsequently reprised the role of the Master in the Third Doctor serials &quot;The Mind of Evil&quot;, &quot;The Claws of Axos&quot;, &quot;Colony in Space&quot;, &quot;The Dæmons&quot;, &quot;The Sea Devils&quot;, &quot;The Time Monster&quot; and &quot;Frontier in Space&quot;. The Master&#x27;s story arc was to have ended in &quot;The Final Game&quot;, which was planned as the final story to feature Pertwee&#x27;s Third Doctor, but the story was scrapped following Delgado&#x27;s sudden death and replaced with &quot;Planet of the Spiders&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Delgado&#x27;s first marriage was to Olga Anthonisz. The marriage ended in divorce. He married Kismet Shahani in 1957 and they were together until his death in 1973. Kismet died in 2017.

== Death ==

Delgado died on location on 18 June 1973 in Nevşehir, Turkey, whilst shooting &quot;La Cloche tibétaine&quot; (Tibetan Bell), a Franco/German television mini-series about the Yellow Expedition. During this expedition, Citroën tracked vehicles traversed Asia in 1931–32 from Peking and Beirut. Delgado appeared in one episode of this production. He was killed, along with two Turkish film technicians, when the car in which he was travelling went off the road into a ravine. He was 55 years old.

For years, there was mystery surrounding the fate of Delgado&#x27;s remains. It was revealed in 2017 that his body had been returned to the United Kingdom and cremated at Mortlake before the ashes were scattered on 27 June 1973, in area RB3 (Plot 43) of the Garden of Remembrance at Mortlake Cemetery in Southwest London.

The serial he was filming in Turkey continued production and was completed after his death. The series was broadcast on French and German television in 1974–1975; Delgado can be seen in episode 4 as the minor character Paco.

Jon Pertwee often remarked that Delgado&#x27;s death was one of the reasons he decided to leave &quot;Doctor Who&quot; the following year.

<doc id="199439" wikidata="Q4956394" url="?curid=199439" title="Predication (computer architecture)">
<text>In computer architecture, predication is a feature that provides an alternative to conditional transfer of control, as implemented by conditional branch machine instructions. Predication works by having conditional (&quot;predicated&quot;) non-branch instructions associated with a &quot;predicate&quot;, a Boolean value used by the instruction to control whether the instruction is allowed to modify the architectural state or not. If the predicate specified in the instruction is true, the instruction modifies the architectural state; otherwise, the architectural state is unchanged. For example, a predicated move instruction (a conditional move) will only modify the destination if the predicate is true. Thus, instead of using a conditional branch to select an instruction or a sequence of instructions to execute based on the predicate that controls whether the branch occurs, the instructions to be executed are associated with that predicate, so that they will be executed, or not executed, based on whether that predicate is true or false.

Vector processors, some SIMD ISAs (such as AVX2 and AVX-512) and GPUs in general make heavy use of predication, applying one bit of a conditional &quot;mask vector&quot; to the corresponding elements in the vector registers being processed, whereas scalar predication in scalar instruction sets only need the one predicate bit. Where predicate masks become particularly powerful in vector processing is if an &quot;array&quot; of condition codes, one per vector element, may feed back into predicate masks that are then applied to subsequent vector instructions.

Most computer programs contain conditional code, which will be executed only under specific conditions depending on factors that cannot be determined beforehand, for example depending on user input. As the majority of processors simply execute the next instruction in a sequence, the traditional solution is to insert &quot;branch&quot; instructions that allow a program to conditionally branch to a different section of code, thus changing the next step in the sequence. This was sufficient until designers began improving performance by implementing instruction pipelining, a method which is slowed down by branches. For a more thorough description of the problems which arose, and a popular solution, see branch predictor.

Luckily, one of the more common patterns of code that normally relies on branching has a more elegant solution. Consider the following pseudocode:
if condition
 {do_something}
else
 {do_something_else}
On a system that uses conditional branching, this might translate to machine instructions looking similar to:
 branch_if_condition_to label1
 do_something_else
 branch_always_to label2
label1:
 do_something
label2:


With predication, all possible branch paths are coded inline, but some instructions execute while others do not. The basic idea is that each instruction is associated with a predicate (the word here used similarly to its usage in predicate logic) and that the instruction will only be executed if the predicate is true. The machine code for the above example using predication might look something like this:
(condition) do_something
(not condition) do_something_else
Besides eliminating branches, less code is needed in total, provided the architecture provides predicated instructions. While this does not guarantee faster execution in general, it will if the codice_1 and codice_2 blocks of code are short enough.

Predication&#x27;s simplest form is &quot;partial predication&quot;, where the architecture has &quot;conditional move&quot; or &quot;conditional select&quot; instructions. Conditional move instructions write the contents of one register over another only if the predicate&#x27;s value is true, whereas conditional select instructions choose which of two registers has its contents written to a third based on the predicate&#x27;s value. A more generalized and capable form is &quot;full predication&quot;. Full predication has a set of predicate registers for storing predicates (which allows multiple nested or sequential branches to be simultaneously eliminated) and most instructions in the architecture have a register specifier field to specify which predicate register supplies the predicate.

==Advantages==
The main purpose of predication is to avoid jumps over very small sections of program code, increasing the effectiveness of pipelined execution and avoiding problems with the cache. It also has a number of more subtle benefits:
*Functions that are traditionally computed using simple arithmetic and bitwise operations may be quicker to compute using predicated instructions.
*Predicated instructions with different predicates can be mixed with each other and with unconditional code, allowing better instruction scheduling and so even better performance.
*Elimination of unnecessary branch instructions can make the execution of necessary branches, such as those that make up loops, faster by lessening the load on branch prediction mechanisms.
*Elimination of the cost of a branch misprediction which can be high on deeply pipelined architectures.
* Instruction sets that have comprehensive Condition Codes generated by instructions may reduce code size further by directly using the Condition Registers in or as predication.

==Disadvantages==
Predication&#x27;s primary drawback is in increased encoding space. In typical implementations, every instruction reserves a bitfield for the predicate specifying under what conditions that instruction should have an effect. When available memory is limited, as on embedded devices, this space cost can be prohibitive. However, some architectures such as Thumb-2 are able to avoid this issue (see below). Other detriments are the following:
*Predication complicates the hardware by adding levels of logic to critical paths and potentially degrades clock speed.
*A predicated block includes cycles for all operations, so shorter paths may take longer and be penalized.
*Predication is not usually speculated and causes a longer dependency chain. For ordered data this translates to a performance loss compared to a predictable branch.

Predication is most effective when paths are balanced or when the longest path is the most frequently executed, but determining such a path is very difficult at compile time, even in the presence of profiling information.

==History==
Predicated instructions were popular in European computer designs of the 1950s, including the Mailüfterl (1955), the Zuse Z22 (1955), the ZEBRA (1958), and the Electrologica X1 (1958). The IBM ACS-1 design of 1967 allocated a &quot;skip&quot; bit in its instruction formats, and the CDC Flexible Processor in 1976 allocated three conditional execution bits in its microinstruction formats.

Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s PA-RISC architecture (1986) had a feature called &quot;nullification&quot;, which allowed most instructions to be predicated by the previous instruction. IBM&#x27;s POWER architecture (1990) featured conditional move instructions. POWER&#x27;s successor, PowerPC (1993), dropped these instructions. Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s Alpha architecture (1992) also featured conditional move instructions. MIPS gained conditional move instructions in 1994 with the MIPS IV version; and SPARC was extended in Version 9 (1994) with conditional move instructions for both integer and floating-point registers.

In the Hewlett-Packard/Intel IA-64 architecture, most instructions are predicated. The predicates are stored in 64 special-purpose predicate registers; and one of the predicate registers is always true so that &quot;unpredicated&quot; instructions are simply instructions predicated with the value true. The use of predication is essential in IA-64&#x27;s implementation of software pipelining because it avoids the need for writing separated code for prologs and epilogs.

In the x86 architecture, a family of conditional move instructions (codice_3 and codice_4) were added to the architecture by the Intel Pentium Pro (1995) processor. The codice_3 instructions copied the contents of the source register to the destination register depending on a predicate supplied by the value of the flag register.

In the ARM architecture, the original 32-bit instruction set provides a feature called &quot;conditional execution&quot; that allows most instructions to be predicated by one of 13 predicates that are based on some combination of the four condition codes set by the previous instruction. ARM&#x27;s Thumb instruction set (1994) dropped conditional execution to reduce the size of instructions so they could fit in 16 bits, but its successor, Thumb-2 (2003) overcame this problem by using a special instruction which has no effect other than to supply predicates for the following four instructions. The 64-bit instruction set introduced in ARMv8-A (2011) replaced conditional execution with conditional selection instructions.

== SIMD, SIMT and vector predication ==

Some SIMD instruction sets, like AVX2, have the ability to use a logical mask to conditionally load/store values to memory, a parallel form of the conditional move, and may also apply individual mask bits to individual arithmetic units executing a parallel operation. The technique is known in Flynn&#x27;s taxonomy as &quot;associative processing&quot;.

This form of predication is also used in vector processors and single instruction, multiple threads GPU computing. All the techniques, advantages and disadvantages of single scalar predication apply just as well to the parallel processing case.

<doc id="199440" wikidata="Q485675" url="?curid=199440" title="Hemolymph">
<text>Hemolymph, or haemolymph, is a fluid, analogous to the blood in vertebrates, that circulates in the interior of the arthropod (invertebrate) body, remaining in direct contact with the animal&#x27;s tissues. It is composed of a fluid plasma in which hemolymph cells called hemocytes are suspended. In addition to hemocytes, the plasma also contains many chemicals. It is the major tissue type of the open circulatory system characteristic of arthropods (for example, arachnids, crustaceans and insects). In addition, some non-arthropods such as mollusks possess a hemolymphatic circulatory system.

Oxygen-transport systems were long thought unnecessary in insects, but ancestral and functional hemocyanin has been found in the hemolymph. Insect &quot;blood&quot; generally does not carry hemoglobin, although hemoglobin may be present in the tracheal system instead and play some role in respiration.

== Method of transport ==

In the grasshopper, the closed portion of the system consists of tubular hearts and an aorta running along the dorsal side of the insect. The hearts pump hemolymph into the sinuses of the hemocoel where exchanges of materials take place. The volume of hemolymph needed for such a system is kept to a minimum by a reduction in the size of the body cavity. The hemocoel is divided into chambers called sinuses.

Coordinated movements of the body muscles gradually bring the hemolymph back to the dorsal sinus surrounding the hearts. Between contractions, tiny valves in the wall of the hearts open and allow hemolymph to enter. Hemolymph fills all of the interior (the hemocoel) of the animal&#x27;s body and surrounds all cells. It contains hemocyanin, a copper-based protein that turns blue when oxygenated, instead of the iron-based hemoglobin in red blood cells found in vertebrates, giving hemolymph a blue-green color rather than the red color of vertebrate blood. When not oxygenated, hemolymph quickly loses its color and appears grey.

The hemolymph of lower arthropods, including most insects, is not used for oxygen transport because these animals respirate through other means, such as tracheas, but it does contain nutrients such as proteins and sugars. Muscular movements by the animal during locomotion can facilitate hemolymph movement, but diverting flow from one area to another is limited. When the heart relaxes, hemolymph is drawn back toward the heart through open-ended pores called ostia. Note that the term &quot;&quot; is not specific to insect circulation; it literally means &quot;doors&quot; or &quot;openings&quot;, and must be understood in context.

== Constituents ==

Hemolymph can contain nucleating agents that confer extracellular freezing protection. Such nucleating agents have been found in the hemolymph of insects of several orders, i.e., Coleoptera (beetles), Diptera (flies), and Hymenoptera.

=== Inorganic ===

Hemolymph is composed of water, inorganic salts (mostly sodium, chlorine, potassium, magnesium, and calcium), and organic compounds (mostly carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids). The primary oxygen transporter molecule is hemocyanin.

=== Amino acids ===

Arthropod hemolymph contains high levels of free amino acids. Most amino acids are present but their relative concentrations vary from species to species. Concentrations of amino acids also vary according to the arthropod stage of development. An example of this is the silkworm and its need for glycine in the production of silk. 

=== Proteins ===

Proteins present in the hemolymph vary in quantity during the course of development. These proteins are classified by their functions: chroma proteins, protease inhibitors, storage, lipid transport, enzymes, the vitellogenins, and those involved in the immune responses of arthropods. Some hemolymphic proteins incorporate carbohydrates and lipids into the structure.

=== Other organic constituents ===

Nitrogen metabolism end products are present in the hemolymph in low concentrations. These include ammonia, allantoin, uric acid, and urea. Arthropod hormones are present, most notably the juvenile hormone. Trehalose can be present and sometimes in great amounts along with glucose. These sugar levels are maintained by the control of hormones. Other carbohydrates can be present. These include inositol, sugar alcohol, hexosamines, mannitol, glycerol and those components that are precursors to chitin.

Free lipids are present and are used as fuel for flight.

== Hemocytes ==

There are free-floating cells, the hemocytes, within the hemolymph. They play a role in the arthropod immune system. The immune system resides in the hemolymph.

== Comparisons to vertebrates ==

This open system might appear to be inefficient compared to the closed circulatory systems of the vertebrates, but the two systems have very different demands placed on them. In vertebrates, the circulatory system is responsible for transporting oxygen to all the tissues and removing carbon dioxide from them. It is this requirement that establishes the level of performance demanded of the system. The efficiency of the vertebrate system is far greater than is needed for transporting nutrients, hormones, and so on, whereas in insects, exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs in the tracheal system. Hemolymph plays no part in the process in most insects. Only in a few insects living in low-oxygen environments are there hemoglobin-like molecules that bind oxygen and transport it to the tissues. Therefore, the demands placed upon the system are much lower. Some arthropods and most molluscs possess the copper-containing hemocyanin, however, for oxygen transport.

== Specialist uses ==

In some species, hemolymph has other uses than just being a blood analogue. As the insect or arachnid grows, the hemolymph works something like a hydraulic system, enabling the insect or arachnid to expand segments before they are sclerotized. It can also be used hydraulically as a means of assisting movement, such as in arachnid locomotion. Some species of insect or arachnid are able to autohaemorrhage when they are attacked by predators. Queens of the ant genus &quot;Leptanilla&quot; are fed with hemolymph produced by the larvae. On the other hand, &quot;Pemphigus spyrothecae&quot; utilize hemolymph as an adhesive, allowing the species to stick to predators and subsequently attack the predator; it was found that with larger predators, more aphids were stuck after the predator was defeated.
