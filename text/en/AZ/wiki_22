<text>Polypropylene (PP), also known as polypropene, is a thermoplastic polymer used in a wide variety of applications. It is produced via chain-growth polymerization from the monomer propylene.

Polypropylene belongs to the group of polyolefins and is partially crystalline and non-polar. Its properties are similar to polyethylene, but it is slightly harder and more heat-resistant. It is a white, mechanically rugged material and has a high chemical resistance.

Polypropylene is the second-most widely produced commodity plastic (after polyethylene).

==History==
Phillips Petroleum chemists J. Paul Hogan and Robert Banks first demonstrated the polymerization of propylene in 1951. The stereoselective polymerization to the isotactic was discovered by Giulio Natta and Karl Rehn in March 1954. This pioneering discovery led to large-scale commercial production of isotactic polypropylene by the Italian firm Montecatini from 1957 onwards. Syndiotactic polypropylene was also first synthesized by Natta. Interest in polypropylene development is ongoing to the present. For example, making polypropylene from bio-based resources is a topic of interest in the 21st century.

==Chemical and physical properties==
Polypropylene is in little aspects similar to polyethylene, especially in solution behavior and electrical properties. The methyl group improves mechanical properties and thermal resistance, although the chemical resistance decreases. The properties of polypropylene depend on the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, crystallinity, type and proportion of comonomer (if used) and the isotacticity. In isotactic polypropylene, for example, the methyl groups are oriented on one side of the carbon backbone. This arrangement creates a greater degree of crystallinity and results in a stiffer material that is more resistant to creep than both atactic polypropylene and polyethylene.

===Mechanical properties===
The density of PP is between 0.895 and 0.93 g/cm3. Therefore, PP is the commodity plastic with the lowest density. With lower density, moldings parts with lower weight and more parts of a certain mass of plastic can be produced. Unlike polyethylene, crystalline and amorphous regions differ only slightly in their density. However, the density of polyethylene can significantly change with fillers.

The Young&#x27;s modulus of PP is between 1300 and 1800 N/mm².

Polypropylene is normally tough and flexible, especially when copolymerized with ethylene. This allows polypropylene to be used as an engineering plastic, competing with materials such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). Polypropylene is reasonably economical.

Polypropylene has good resistance to fatigue.

===Thermal properties===
The melting point of polypropylene occurs in a range, so the melting point is determined by finding the highest temperature of a differential scanning calorimetry chart. Perfectly isotactic PP has a melting point of . Commercial isotactic PP has a melting point that ranges from , depending on atactic material and crystallinity. Syndiotactic PP with a crystallinity of 30% has a melting point of . Below 0 °C, PP becomes brittle.

The thermal expansion of PP is significant, but somewhat less than that of polyethylene. 

===Chemical properties===
Propylene molecules prefer to join together &quot;head-to-tail&quot;, giving a chain with methyl groups on every other carbon, but some randomness occurs.

Polypropylene at room temperature is resistant to fats and almost all organic solvents, apart from strong oxidants. Non-oxidizing acids and bases can be stored in containers made of PP. At elevated temperature, PP can be dissolved in nonpolar solvents such as xylene, tetralin and decalin. Due to the tertiary carbon atom, PP is chemically less resistant than PE (see Markovnikov rule).

Most commercial polypropylene is isotactic and has an intermediate level of crystallinity between that of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Isotactic &amp; atactic polypropylene is soluble in &quot;p&quot;-xylene at 140 °C. Isotactic precipitates when the solution is cooled to 25 °C and atactic portion remains soluble in &quot;p&quot;-xylene.

The melt flow rate (MFR) or melt flow index (MFI) is a measure of molecular weight of polypropylene. The measure helps to determine how easily the molten raw material will flow during processing. Polypropylene with higher MFR will fill the plastic mold more easily during the injection or blow-molding production process. As the melt flow increases, however, some physical properties, like impact strength, will decrease.

There are three general types of polypropylene: homopolymer, random copolymer, and block copolymer. The comonomer is typically used with ethylene. Ethylene-propylene rubber or EPDM added to polypropylene homopolymer increases its low temperature impact strength. Randomly polymerized ethylene monomer added to polypropylene homopolymer decreases the polymer crystallinity, lowers the melting point and makes the polymer more transparent.

==== Molecular structure – tacticity ====


The term tacticity describes for polypropylene how the methyl group is oriented in the polymer chain. Commercial polypropylene is usually isotactic. This article therefore always refers to isotactic polypropylene, unless stated otherwise. The tacticity is usually indicated in percent, using the isotactic index (according to DIN 16774). The index is measured by determining the fraction of the polymer insoluble in boiling heptane. Commercially available polypropylenes usually have an isotactic index between 85 and 95%. The tacticity effects the polymer&#x27;s physical properties. As the methyl group is in isotactic propylene consistently located at the same side, it forces the macromolecule in a helical shape, as also found in starch. An isotactic structure leads to a semi-crystalline polymer. The higher the isotonicity(the isotactic fraction), the greater the crystallinity, and thus also the softening point, rigidity, e-modulus and hardness.

Atactic polypropylene, on the other hand, lacks any regularity, which prevents it from crystallization, thereby creating an amorphous material.

==== Crystal structure of polypropylene ====
Isotactic polypropylene has a high degree of crystallinity, in industrial products 30–60%. Syndiotactic polypropylene is slightly less crystalline, atactic PP is amorphous (not crystalline).

===== Isotactic polypropylene (iPP) =====
Is polypropylene can exist in various crystalline modifications which differ by the molecular arrangement of the polymer chains. The crystalline modifications are categorized into the α-, β- and γ-modification as well as mesomorphic (smectic) forms. The α-modifications is predominant in iPP. Such crystals are built from lamellae in the form of folded chains. A characteristic anomaly is that the lame are arranged in the so-called &quot;cross-hatched&quot; structure. The melting point of α-crystalline regions is given as 185 to 220 °C, the density as 0.936 to 0.946 g·cm−3. The β-modification is in comparison somewhat less ordered, as a result of which it forms faster and has a lower melting point of 170 to 200 °C. The formation of the β-modification can be promoted by nucleating agents, suitable temperatures and shear stress. The γ-modification is hardly formed under the conditions used in industry and is poorly understood. The mesomorphic modification, however, occurs often in industrial processing, since the plastic is usually cooled quickly. The degree of order of the mesomorphic phase ranges between the crystalline and the amorphous phase, its density is with 0.916 g·cm−3 comparatively. The mesomorphic phase is considered as cause for the transparency in rapidly cooled films (due to low order and small crystallites).

===== Syndiotactic polypropylene (sPP) =====
Syndiotactic polypropylene was discovered much later than isotactic PP and could only be prepared by using metallocene catalysts. Syndiotactic PP has a lower melting point, with 161 to 186 °C, depending on the degree of tacticity.

===== Atactic polypropylene (aPP) =====
Atactic polypropylene is amorphous and has therefore no crystal structure. Due to its lack of crystallinity, it is readily soluble even at moderate temperatures, which allows to separate it as by-product from isotactic polypropylene by extraction. However, the aPP obtained this way is not completely amorphous but can still contain 15% crystalline parts. Atactic polypropylene can also be produced selectively using metallocene catalysts, atactic polypropylene produced this way has a considerably higher molecular weight.

Atactic polypropylene has lower density, melting point and softening temperature than the crystalline types and is tacky and rubber-like at room temperature. It is a colorless, cloudy material and can be used between −15 and +120 °C. Atactic polypropylene is used as a sealant, as an insulating material for automobiles and as an additive to bitumen.

====Copolymers====
Polypropylene copolymers are in use as well. A particularly important one is polypropylene random copolymer (PPR or PP-R), a random copolymer with polyethylene used for plastic pipework.

====PP-RCT====
Polypropylene random crystallinity temperature (PP-RCT), also used for plastic pipework, is a new form of this plastic. It achieves higher strength at high temperature by β-crystallization.

====Degradation====

Polypropylene is liable to chain degradation from exposure to temperatures above 100 °C. Oxidation usually occurs at the tertiary carbon centers leading to chain breaking via reaction with oxygen. In external applications, degradation is evidenced by cracks and crazing. It may be protected by the use of various polymer stabilizers, including UV-absorbing additives and anti-oxidants such as phosphites (e.g. tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)phosphite) and hindered phenols, which prevent polymer degradation.

Microbial communities isolated from soil samples mixed with starch have been shown to be capable of degrading polypropylene.
Polypropylene has been reported to degrade while in the human body as implantable mesh devices. The degraded material forms a tree bark-like layer at the surface of mesh fibers.

===Optical properties===
PP can be made translucent when uncolored but is not as readily made transparent as polystyrene, acrylic, or certain other plastics. It is often opaque or colored using pigments.

==Production==
Polypropylene is produced by the chain-growth polymerization of propene:

The industrial production processes can be grouped into gas phase polymerization, bulk polymerization and slurry polymerization. All state-of-the-art processes use either gas-phase or bulk reactor systems.

*In gas-phase and slurry-reactors, the polymer is formed around heterogeneous catalyst particles. The gas-phase polymerization is carried out in a fluidized bed reactor, propene is passed over a bed containing the heterogeneous (solid) catalyst and the formed polymer is separated as a fine powder and then converted into pellets. Unreacted gas is recycled and fed back into the reactor.
*In bulk polymerization, liquid propene acts as a solvent to prevent the precipitation of the polymer. The polymerization proceeds at 60 to 80 °C and 30–40 atm are applied to keep the propene in the liquid state. For the bulk polymerization, typically loop reactors are applied. The bulk polymerization is limited to a maximum of 5% ethene as comonomer due to a limited solubility of the polymer in the liquid propene.
*In the slurry polymerization, typically C4–C6 alkanes (butane, pentane or hexane) are utilized as inert diluent to suspend the growing polymer particles. Propene is introduced into the mixture as a gas.

===Catalysts===
The properties of PP are strongly affected by its tacticity, the orientation of the methyl groups () relative to the methyl groups in neighboring monomer units. A Ziegler–Natta catalyst is able to restrict linking of monomer molecules to a specific orientation, either isotactic, when all methyl groups are positioned at the same side with respect to the backbone of the polymer chain, or syndiotactic, when the positions of the methyl groups alternate.

Commercially available isotactic polypropylene is made with two types of Ziegler-Natta catalysts. The first group of the catalysts encompasses solid (mostly supported) catalysts and certain types of soluble metallocene catalysts. Such isotactic macromolecules coil into a helical shape; these helices then line up next to one another to form the crystals that give commercial isotactic polypropylene many of its desirable properties.

Modern supported Ziegler-Natta catalysts developed for the polymerization of propylene and other 1-alkenes to isotactic polymers usually use as an active ingredient and as a support. The catalysts also contain organic modifiers, either aromatic acid esters and diesters or ethers. These catalysts are activated with special co-catalysts containing an organoaluminium compound such as Al(C2H5)3 and the second type of a modifier. The catalysts are differentiated depending on the procedure used for fashioning catalyst particles from MgCl2 and depending on the type of organic modifiers employed during catalyst preparation and use in polymerization reactions. Two most important technological characteristics of all the supported catalysts are high productivity and a high fraction of the crystalline isotactic polymer they produce at 70–80 °C under standard polymerization conditions. Commercial synthesis of isotactic polypropylene is usually carried out either in the medium of liquid propylene or in gas-phase reactors.

Commercial synthesis of syndiotactic polypropylene is carried out with the use of a special class of metallocene catalysts. They employ bridged bis-metallocene complexes of the type bridge-(Cp1)(Cp2)ZrCl2 where the first Cp ligand is the cyclopentadienyl group, the second Cp ligand is the fluorenyl group, and the bridge between the two Cp ligands is -CH2-CH2-, &gt;SiMe2, or &gt;SiPh2. These complexes are converted to polymerization catalysts by activating them with a special organoaluminium co-catalyst, methylaluminoxane (MAO).

Atactic polypropylene is an amorphous rubbery material. It can be produced commercially either with a special type of supported Ziegler-Natta catalyst or with some metallocene catalysts.

==Manufacturing from polypropylene==
Melting process of polypropylene can be achieved via extrusion and molding. Common extrusion methods include production of melt-blown and spun-bond fibers to form long rolls for future conversion into a wide range of useful products, such as face masks, filters, diapers and wipes.

The most common shaping technique is injection molding, which is used for parts such as cups, cutlery, vials, caps, containers, housewares, and automotive parts such as batteries. The related techniques of blow molding and injection-stretch blow molding are also used, which involve both extrusion and molding.

The large number of end-use applications for polypropylene are often possible because of the ability to tailor grades with specific molecular properties and additives during its manufacture. For example, antistatic additives can be added to help polypropylene surfaces resist dust and dirt. Many physical finishing techniques can also be used on polypropylene, such as machining. Surface treatments can be applied to polypropylene parts in order to promote adhesion of printing ink and paints.

Expanded Polypropylene (EPP) has been produced through both solid and melt state processing. EPP is manufactured using melt processing with either chemical or physical blowing agents. Expansion of PP in solid state, due to its highly crystalline structure, has not been successful. In this regard, two novel strategies were developed for expansion of PP. It was observed that PP can be expanded to make EPP through controlling its crystalline structure or through blending with other polymers.

===Biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP)===
When polypropylene film is extruded and stretched in both the machine direction and across machine direction it is called &quot;biaxially oriented polypropylene&quot;. Two methods are widely used for producing BOPP films, namely, a bi-directional stenter process or a double-bubble blown film extrusion process. Biaxial orientation increases strength and clarity. BOPP is widely used as a packaging material for packaging products such as snack foods, fresh produce and confectionery. It is easy to coat, print and laminate to give the required appearance and properties for use as a packaging material. This process is normally called converting. It is normally produced in large rolls which are slit on slitting machines into smaller rolls for use on packaging machines. BOPP is also used for stickers and labels in addition to OPP.
It is non-reactive, which makes BOPP suitable for safe use in the pharmaceutical and food industry. It is one of the most important commercial polyolefin films. BOPP films are available in different thicknesses and widths. They are transparent and flexible.

==Applications==

As polypropylene is resistant to fatigue, most plastic living hinges, such as those on flip-top bottles, are made from this material. However, it is important to ensure that chain molecules are oriented across the hinge to maximise strength.

Polypropylene is used in the manufacturing of piping systems, both ones concerned with high purity and ones designed for strength and rigidity (e.g., those intended for use in potable plumbing, hydronic heating and cooling, and reclaimed water). This material is often chosen for its resistance to corrosion and chemical leaching, its resilience against most forms of physical damage, including impact and freezing, its environmental benefits, and its ability to be joined by heat fusion rather than gluing.

Many plastic items for medical or laboratory use can be made from polypropylene because it can withstand the heat in an autoclave. Its heat resistance also enables it to be used as the manufacturing material of consumer-grade kettles. Food containers made from it will not melt in the dishwasher, and do not melt during industrial hot filling processes. For this reason, most plastic tubs for dairy products are polypropylene sealed with aluminum foil (both heat-resistant materials). After the product has cooled, the tubs are often given lids made of a less heat-resistant material, such as LDPE or polystyrene. Such containers provide a good hands-on example of the difference in modulus, since the rubbery (softer, more flexible) feeling of LDPE with respect to polypropylene of the same thickness is readily apparent. Rugged, translucent, reusable plastic containers made in a wide variety of shapes and sizes for consumers from various companies such as Rubbermaid and Sterilite are commonly made of polypropylene, although the lids are often made of somewhat more flexible LDPE so they can snap onto the container to close it. Polypropylene can also be made into disposable bottles to contain liquid, powdered, or similar consumer products, although HDPE and polyethylene terephthalate are commonly also used to make bottles. Plastic pails, car batteries, wastebaskets, pharmacy prescription bottles, cooler containers, dishes and pitchers are often made of polypropylene or HDPE, both of which commonly have rather similar appearance, feel, and properties at ambient temperature. An abundance of medical devices are made from PP.

A common application for polypropylene is as biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP). These BOPP sheets are used to make a wide variety of materials including clear bags. When polypropylene is biaxially oriented, it becomes crystal clear and serves as an excellent packaging material for artistic and retail products.

Polypropylene, highly colorfast, is widely used in manufacturing carpets, rugs and mats to be used at home.

Polypropylene is widely used in ropes, distinctive because they are light enough to float in water. For equal mass and construction, polypropylene rope is similar in strength to polyester rope. Polypropylene costs less than most other synthetic fibers.

Polypropylene is also used as an alternative to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as insulation for electrical cables for LSZH cable in low-ventilation environments, primarily tunnels. This is because it emits less smoke and no toxic halogens, which may lead to production of acid in high-temperature conditions.

Polypropylene is also used in particular roofing membranes as the waterproofing top layer of single-ply systems as opposed to modified-bit systems.

Polypropylene is most commonly used for plastic moldings, wherein it is injected into a mold while molten, forming complex shapes at relatively low cost and high volume; examples include bottle tops, bottles, and fittings.

It can also be produced in sheet form, widely used for the production of stationery folders, packaging, and storage boxes. The wide color range, durability, low cost, and resistance to dirt make it ideal as a protective cover for papers and other materials. It is used in Rubik&#x27;s Cube stickers because of these characteristics.

The availability of sheet polypropylene has provided an opportunity for the use of the material by designers. The light-weight, durable, and colorful plastic makes an ideal medium for the creation of light shades, and a number of designs have been developed using interlocking sections to create elaborate designs.

Polypropylene fibres are used as a concrete additive to increase strength and reduce cracking and spalling. In some areas susceptible to earthquakes (e.g., California), PP fibers are added with soils to improve the soil&#x27;s strength and damping when constructing the foundation of structures such as buildings, bridges, etc.

===Clothing===

Polypropylene is a major polymer used in nonwovens, with over 50% used for diapers or sanitary products where it is treated to absorb water (hydrophilic) rather than naturally repelling water (hydrophobic). Other non-woven uses include filters for air, gas, and liquids in which the fibers can be formed into sheets or webs that can be pleated to form cartridges or layers that filter in various efficiencies in the 0.5 to 30 micrometre range. Such applications occur in houses as water filters or in air-conditioning-type filters. The high surface-area and naturally oleophilic polypropylene nonwovens are ideal absorbers of oil spills with the familiar floating barriers near oil spills on rivers.

Polypropylene, or &#x27;polypro&#x27;, has been used for the fabrication of cold-weather base layers, such as long-sleeve shirts or long underwear. Polypropylene is also used in warm-weather clothing, in which it transports sweat away from the skin. Polyester has replaced polypropylene in these applications in the U.S. military, such as in the ECWCS. Although polypropylene clothes are not easily flammable, they can melt, which may result in severe burns if the wearer is involved in an explosion or fire of any kind. Polypropylene undergarments are known for retaining body odors which are then difficult to remove. The current generation of polyester does not have this disadvantage.

===Medical===
Its most common medical use is in the synthetic, nonabsorbable suture Prolene, manufactured by Ethicon Inc.

Polypropylene has been used in hernia and pelvic organ prolapse repair operations to protect the body from new hernias in the same location. A small patch of the material is placed over the spot of the hernia, below the skin, and is painless and rarely, if ever, rejected by the body. However, a polypropylene mesh will erode the tissue surrounding it over the uncertain period from days to years.

A notable application was as a transvaginal mesh, used to treat vaginal prolapse and concurrent urinary incontinence. Due to the above-mentioned propensity for polypropylene mesh to erode the tissue surrounding it, the FDA has issued several warnings on the use of polypropylene mesh medical kits for certain applications in pelvic organ prolapse, specifically when introduced in close proximity to the vaginal wall due to a continued increase in number of mesh-driven tissue erosions reported by patients over the past few years. On 3 January 2012, the FDA ordered 35 manufacturers of these mesh products to study the side effects of these devices.
Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the demand for PP has increased significantly because it is a vital raw material for producing meltblown fabric, which is in turn the raw material for producing facial masks.

==Recycling==

Most polypropylene recycling uses mechanical recycling, as for polyethylene: the material is heated to soften or melt it, and mechanically formed it into new products. As of 2015, less than 1% of polypropylene generated was recycled. Heating degrades the carbon backbone more severely than for polyethylene, breaking it into smaller organic molecules, because the methyl side group of PP is susceptible to thermo-oxidative and photo-oxidative degradation.

Polypropylene has the number &quot;5&quot; as its resin identification code: 

==Repairing==
PP objects can be joined with a two-part epoxy glue or using hot-glue guns.

PP can be melted using a speed tip welding technique. With speed welding, the plastic welder, similar to a soldering iron in appearance and wattage, is fitted with a feed tube for the plastic weld rod. The speed tip heats the rod and the substrate, while at the same time it presses the molten weld rod into position. A bead of softened plastic is laid into the joint and the parts and weld rod fuse. With polypropylene, the melted welding rod must be &quot;mixed&quot; with the semi-melted base material being fabricated or repaired. A speed tip &quot;gun&quot; is essentially a soldering iron with a broad, flat tip that can be used to melt the weld joint and filler material to create a bond.

==Health concerns==
The advocacy organization Environmental Working Group classifies PP as of low hazard.
PP is dope-dyed; no water is used in its dyeing, in contrast with cotton. Polypropylene was the most common microplastic fiber found in the olfactory bulbs in 8 of 15 deceased individuals in a study.

==Combustibility==
Like all organic compounds, polypropylene is combustible. The flash point of a typical composition is 260 °C; autoignition temperature is 388 °C.

<doc id="201690" wikidata="Q903190" url="?curid=201690" title="Joint Direct Attack Munition">
<text>The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a guidance kit that converts unguided bombs, or &quot;dumb bombs&quot;, into all-weather precision-guided munitions (PGMs). JDAM-equipped bombs are guided by an integrated inertial guidance system coupled to a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, giving them a published range of up to . JDAM-equipped bombs range from . The JDAM&#x27;s guidance system was jointly developed by the United States Air Force and United States Navy, hence the &quot;joint&quot; in JDAM. When installed on a bomb, the JDAM kit is given a GBU (Guided Bomb Unit) identifier, superseding the Mark 80 or BLU (Bomb, Live Unit) nomenclature of the bomb to which it is attached.

The JDAM is not a stand-alone weapon; rather it is a &quot;bolt-on&quot; guidance package that converts unguided gravity bombs into PGMs. The key components of the system are a tail section with aerodynamic control surfaces, a (body) strake kit, and a combined inertial guidance system and GPS guidance control unit.

The JDAM was meant to improve upon laser-guided bomb and imaging infrared technology, which can be hindered by bad ground and weather conditions. Laser seekers are now being fitted to some JDAMs.

From 1998 to November 2016, Boeing completed more than 300,000 JDAM guidance kits. In 2017 it built more than 130 kits per day. As of January 2024, 550,000 kits had been produced.

==History==
===Development===
The U.S. Air Force&#x27;s bombing campaign during the Persian Gulf War&#x27;s Operation Desert Storm was less effective than initially reported, in part because it had no precision bombs that were accurate in all types of weather. Laser guidance packages on bombs proved exceptionally accurate in clear conditions, but amid airborne dust, smoke, fog, or cloud cover, they had difficulty maintaining &quot;lock&quot; on the laser designation. Research, development, testing and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) of an &quot;adverse weather precision guided munition&quot; began in 1992. Several proposals were considered, including a radical concept that used GPS.

At the time, there were few GPS satellites and the idea of using satellite navigation for real-time weapon guidance was untested and controversial. To identify the technical risk associated with an INS/GPS guided weapon, the Air Force created in early 1992 a rapid-response High Gear program called the &quot;JDAM Operational Concept Demonstration&quot; (OCD) at Eglin Air Force Base. Honeywell, Interstate Electronics Corporation, Sverdrup Technology, and McDonnell Douglas were hired to help the USAF 46th Test Wing demonstrate the feasibility of a GPS weapon within one year. The OCD program fitted a GBU-15 guided bomb with an INS/GPS guidance kit and on 10 February 1993, dropped the first INS/GPS weapon from an F-16 on a target downrange. Five more tests were run in various weather conditions, altitudes, and ranges. The OCD program demonstrated a Circular Error Probable (CEP).

The first JDAM kits were delivered in 1997, with operational testing conducted in 1998 and 1999. During testing, over 450 JDAMs were dropped achieving a system reliability in excess of 95% with a published accuracy under CEP. In addition to controlled parameter drops, the testing and evaluation of the JDAM also included &quot;operationally representative tests&quot; consisting of drops through clouds, rain and snow with no decrease in accuracy from clear-weather tests. In addition, there have been tests involving multiple weapon drops with each weapon being individually targeted.
JDAM and the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber made their combat debuts during Operation Allied Force. The B-2s, flying 30-hour, nonstop, round-trip flights from Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, delivered more than 650 JDAMs during Allied Force. An article published in the &quot;Acquisition Review Journal&quot; in 2002 cites that &quot;during Operation Allied Force ... B-2s launched 651 JDAMs with 96% reliability and hit 87% of intended targets...&quot; Due to the operational success of the original JDAM, the program expanded to the Mark 82 and Mark 83, beginning development in late 1999. As a result of lessons from Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, both the US Navy and US Air Force pursued improvements to the kits such as better GPS accuracy as well as a precision seeker for terminal guidance for use against moving targets.

JDAM bombs are inexpensive compared to alternatives such as cruise missiles. The original cost estimate was $40,000 each for the tail kits; however, after competitive bidding, contracts were signed with McDonnell Douglas (later Boeing) for delivery at $18,000 each. Unit costs, in current-year dollars, have since increased to $21,000 in 2004 and $27,000 by 2011. To the cost of the tail kit should be added the costs of the Mk80-series iron bomb, the fuze and proximity sensor which bring the overall weapon cost to about $30,000. For comparison, the newest Tomahawk cruise missile, dubbed the Tactical Tomahawk, costs nearly $730,000 (FY 2006).

===Operational use===
Guidance is facilitated through a tail control system and a GPS-aided inertial navigation system (INS). The navigation system is initialized by transfer alignment from the aircraft that provides position and velocity vectors from the aircraft systems. Once released from the aircraft, the JDAM autonomously navigates to the designated target coordinates. Target coordinates can be loaded into the aircraft before takeoff, manually altered by the aircrew in flight prior to weapon release, or entered by a datalink from onboard targeting equipment, such as the LITENING II or &quot;Sniper&quot; targeting pods. In its most accurate mode, the JDAM system will provide a minimum weapon accuracy CEP of or less when a GPS signal is available. If the GPS signal is jammed or lost, the JDAM can still achieve a CEP or less for free flight times up to 100 seconds.

The introduction of GPS guidance to weapons brought several improvements to air-to-ground warfare. The first is a real all-weather capability since GPS is not affected by rain, clouds, fog, smoke, or artificial obscurants. Previous precision guided weapons relied on seekers using infrared, visual light, or a reflected laser spot to &quot;see&quot; the ground target. These seekers were not effective when the target was obscured by fog and low altitude clouds and rain (as encountered in Kosovo), or by dust and smoke (as encountered in Desert Storm).

The second advantage is an expanded launch acceptance region (LAR). The LAR defines the region that the aircraft must be within to launch the weapon and hit the target. Non-GPS based precision guided weapons using seekers to guide to the target have significant restrictions on the launch envelope due to the seeker field of view. Some of these systems (such as the Paveway I, II, and III) must be launched so that the target remains in the seeker field of view throughout the weapon trajectory (or for lock-on-after-launch engagements, the weapon must be launched so that the target is in the field of view during the terminal flight). This requires the aircraft to fly generally straight at the target when launching the weapon.

This restriction is eased in some other systems, such as the GBU-15 and the AGM-130, through the ability of a Weapon System Operator (WSO) in the aircraft to manually steer the weapon to the target. Using a WSO requires a data link between the weapon and the controlling aircraft and requires the controlling aircraft to remain in the area (and possibly vulnerable to defensive fire) as long as the weapon is under manual control. Since GPS-based flight control systems know the weapon&#x27;s current location and the target location, these weapons can autonomously adjust the trajectory to hit the target. This allows the launch aircraft to release the weapon at very large off-axis angles including releasing weapons to attack targets behind the aircraft.

The third advantage is a true &quot;fire-and-forget&quot; capability in which the weapon does not require any support after being launched. This allows the launching aircraft to leave the target area and proceed to its next mission immediately after launching the GPS guided weapon.

Another important capability provided by GPS-based guidance is the ability to completely tailor a flight trajectory to meet criteria other than simply hitting a target. Weapon trajectories can be controlled so that a target can be impacted at precise headings and vertical angles. This provides the ability to impact perpendicular to a target surface and minimize the angle of attack (maximizing penetration), detonate the warhead at the optimum angle to maximize the warhead effectiveness, or have the weapon fly into the target area from a different heading than the launch aircraft (decreasing the risk of detection of the aircraft). GPS also provides an accurate time source common to all systems; this allows multiple weapons to loiter and impact targets at preplanned times and intervals.

In recognition of these advantages, most weapons including the Paveway, GBU-15, and the AGM-130 have been upgraded with a GPS capability. This enhancement combines the flexibility of GPS with the superior accuracy of seeker guidance.

Despite their precision, JDAM employment has risks. On 5 December 2001, a JDAM dropped by a B-52 in Afghanistan nearly killed Hamid Karzai while he was leading anti-Taliban forces near Sayd Alim Kalay alongside a US Army Special Forces (SF) team. A large force of Taliban soldiers had engaged the combined force of Karzai&#x27;s men and their American SF counterparts, nearly overwhelming them. The SF commander requested Close Air Support (CAS) to strike the Taliban positions in an effort to stop their advance. A JDAM was subsequently dropped, but instead of striking the Taliban positions, it struck the Afghan/American position, killing three and injuring 20. An investigation of the incident determined that the U.S. Air Force Tactical Control Party (TACP) attached to the Special Forces team had changed the battery in the GPS receiver at some point during the battle, thereby causing the device to return to &quot;default&quot; and &quot;display its own coordinates.&quot; Not realizing that this had occurred, the TACP relayed his own coordinates to the delivery aircraft.

On 5 May 2023, during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, MSN reported that Russia was able to jam the GPS guidance system to cause JDAMs to miss their targets. The leaked Pentagon document described the JDAMs as being particularly susceptible to the disruption.

On 6 June 2023, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) released a commentary by an electronic warfare (EW) expert on the jamming of JDAMs by Russian forces. The paper notes that the Russian R-330Zh Zhitel has had impacted GPS signals that JDAMs rely on. GPS signals are &quot;very weak by the time they have travelled the 10,900 nautical miles (20,200 km) from the satellite to Earth&quot;, making them &quot;easy to jam with comparatively little power&quot;. In the &quot;early 2000s&quot; the US military rolled out the Selective availability anti-spoofing module (SAASM), along with encrypted military M-code GPS signaling to ensure that the JDAM only accepts signals with correct encryption and rejects all other signals. However, according to one electronic warfare (EW) expert who spoke to RUSI, despite the mentioned steps to increase jamming resiliency, the &quot;sheer brute force&quot; of a powerful jamming signal can prevent the JDAM&#x27;s global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver from obtaining the encrypted signal.

Counter-EW systems, while classified, might allow a JDAM to recognize a jamming signal and its direction and &quot;block out&quot; signals coming from that direction. A GNSS receiver will &quot;typically need to &#x27;see&#x27; – that is have an uninterrupted Line-of-Sight (LOS) with – at least four satellites&quot;, and will &quot;often&quot; have more satellites available to it. Thus, blocking signals from one direction might not affect the receiver&#x27;s ability to &quot;see&quot; other satellites. Russian forces may choose to respond by placing more jammers in order to deny a line of sight to the satellites that it requires. Russian EW units might also have the ability to spoof or fake the M-Code that it confuses the JDAM as to its location and time. Ukrainian forces have been able to locate Russian jammers and hit them with &quot;kinetic&quot; attacks such as artillery. Several Russian EW units have been targeted and lost equipment.

On 13 August 2024, Ukrainian Su-27 launched a JDAM at a Russian command post in Tetkino, which was reportedly destroyed.

In December 2023, the WSJ report stated that US arms shipments to Israel since the start of the Israel–Hamas war included approximately 3,000 JDAMs. Israeli F-15I fighter jets are believed to have used BLU-109 bunker buster bombs with JDAM guidance kits in the strikes that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Lebanon on 27 September 2024.

===Upgrades===
Experience during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom led US air power planners to seek additional capabilities in one package, resulting in ongoing program upgrades to place a precision terminal guidance seeker in the JDAM kit. The Laser JDAM (LJDAM), as this upgrade is known, adds a laser seeker to the nose of a JDAM-equipped bomb, enabling it to engage moving targets. The laser seeker is a cooperative development between Boeing&#x27;s Defense, Space and Security unit and Israel&#x27;s Elbit Systems.

It is called the Precision Laser Guidance Set (PLGS) by Boeing and consists of the laser seeker itself, now known as DSU-38/B, and a wire harness fixed under the bomb body to connect the DSU-38/B with the tail kit. During FY2004, Boeing and the U.S. Air Force began testing of the laser guidance capability for JDAM, with these tests demonstrating that the system is capable of targeting and destroying moving targets. This dual guidance system retains the ability to operate on GPS/INS alone, if laser guidance is unavailable, with the same accuracy of the earlier JDAM.

In June 2007, Boeing announced that it had been awarded a $28 million contract by the U.S. Air Force to deliver 600 laser seekers (400 to the Air Force and 200 to the Navy) by June 2009. According to the Boeing Corporation, in tests at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcons and F-15E Strike Eagles dropped twelve LJDAMs that successfully struck high-speed moving targets. Using onboard targeting equipment, the launch aircraft self-designated, and self-guided their bombs to impact on the targets. In addition to the LJDAM kits, Boeing is also testing under a Navy development contract, an anti-jamming system for the JDAM, with development expected to be completed during 2007, with deliveries to commence in 2008. The system is known as the Integrated GPS Anti-Jam System (IGAS).

In July 2008 Germany signed a contract with Boeing to become the first international customer of LJDAM. Deliveries for the German Air Force began in mid-2009. The order also includes the option for further kits in 2009.

Boeing announced in September 2008 that it had conducted demonstration flights with the LJDAM loaded aboard a B-52H.

The GBU-54 LJDAM made its combat debut in August 2008 in Iraq when an F-16 from the 77th Fighter Squadron engaged a moving vehicle in Diyala province. The GBU-54 LJDAM made its combat debut in the Afghan theater by the 510th Fighter Squadron in October 2010.

In September 2012, Boeing began full-rate production of Laser JDAM for US Navy and received a contract for more than 2,300 bomb kits.

In November 2014, the U.S. Air Force began development of a version of the GBU-31 JDAM intended to track and attack sources of electronic warfare jamming directed to disrupt the munitions&#x27; guidance. The Home-on-Jam seeker works similar to the AGM-88 HARM to follow the source of a radio-frequency jammer to destroy it.

In 2006, the Australian Defence Science and Technology Organisation in conjunction with Boeing Australia successfully tested extended range JDAM variants at the Woomera Test Range.

In 2009, Boeing announced that it will jointly develop the Joint Direct Attack Munition Extended Range (JDAM-ER) version with South Korea. The wing kit will triple the range of JDAM to for the same accuracy, and will cost $10,000 per unit. The first prototypes were completed in 2010 or 2011.

The wing kits of Australia&#x27;s JDAM-ER weapons will be built by Ferra Engineering. First tests were to be conducted in 2013 with production orders in 2015.

In late February 2023, it was revealed that JDAM-ERs would be provided to the Ukrainian Air Force as part of an arms package during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. With a standoff range of up to , it delivers similar range to M142 HIMARS rockets, but with heavier warheads and at a lower cost. Although Russian air defenses force Ukrainian aircraft to fly at extremely low levels, they could pop up and release the bombs on a lofted trajectory to glide toward a target. Ukrainian platforms needed modifications to employ the weapons, as had been done with the AGM-88 HARM. The JDAM-ER was already in use by the Ukrainians by the time of the reports of its delivery.

Yuriy Ignat, a spokesman for Air Force Command of the Ukrainian Armed Force, told Ukrainian TV that: &quot;These bombs (JDAM) are slightly less powerful, but extremely accurate. I would like to have more such bombs for success at the front.&quot; This comment might be a reference to the fact that these bombs are 500 pounds. As to how many were supplied one US official said &quot;enough to do a couple of strikes.&quot;

On 26 April, the first recorded use of JDAMs, by the Ukrainian Air Force, occurred in Bakhmut. Four 500 pound JDAMs were dropped on a high rise building in the Russian controlled part of the city, the aircraft used appear to be MiG-29s. Both sides have destroyed high rise buildings in Bakhmut to prevent them from being used &quot;as ammo dumps, fighting positions and observation posts.&quot;

In response to Russian use of electronic warfare to jam GPS-guided weapons, in May 2024 the U.S. awarded a contract for the acquisition of Home-on GPS Jam seekers to be integrated into JDAM wing kits for Ukraine.

On 3 February 2025, the Ukrainian Air Force released footage of a Su27 dropping two 1,000 pound Mark 83 bombs. Previously the existence of a 1,000 pound variant of the JDAM wasn’t know to exist. Indicating it was made specifically for Ukrainian usage.

===Powered JDAM (PJDAM)===

In 2010, Boeing proposed adding a jet engine tailkit to the JDAM-ER for 10 times greater range. The U.S. Air Force initially showed no interest in the concept, but by 2020 Boeing believed the service had regained interest in acquiring low-cost cruise missiles. The Powered JDAM combines a bomb with a wing kit and a propulsion module, giving it the range of more sophisticated missiles through a low-cost engine while being cheaper though not having a stealthy shape or the ability to conduct low-altitude flights. Though less survivable, Powered JDAMs could be networked to provide a cheap standoff weapon to overwhelm air defense systems.

===Anti-ship deployments===

In September 2014, the U.S. Air Force performed the first-ever drop of a precision-guided aerial sea mine, consisting of a Quickstrike mine equipped with a JDAM kit. The Quickstrike is a Mark 80-series general-purpose bomb with the fuze replaced with a target detection device (TDD) to detonate it when a ship passes within lethal range, a safe/arm device in the nose, and a parachute-retarder tailkit in the back. Dropping of naval mines has historically been challenging, as the delivery aircraft has to fly low and slow, at , making it vulnerable to hostile fire. The first aerial mining mission of Operation Desert Storm resulted in the loss of an aircraft, and the U.S. has not flown any combat aerial minings since.

The Quickstrike-J is a JDAM-equipped or version, and the GBU-62B(V-1)/B Quickstrike-ER is a or gliding version based on the JDAM-ER, which has a range of when launched from . Precision airdropping of naval mines is the first advance in aerial mine delivery techniques since World War II. It can increase the survivability of delivery aircraft, since instead of making multiple slow passes at low altitude directly over the area, an aircraft can release all of their mines in a single pass from a standoff distance and altitude. This increases the mines&#x27; effectiveness, since instead of laying a random pattern of mines in a loosely defined area, they can be laid directly into harbor mouths, shipping channels, canals, rivers, and inland waterways, reducing the number of mines required and enhancing the possibility of blocking ship transit corridors. Enemy naval ports can be blockaded, and a defensive minefield quickly planted to protect areas threatened by amphibious assault. 

A direct-attack bomb version called &quot;Quicksink&quot; was tested in 2022, and were successfully used to sink and during the RIMPAC 2024 exercise.

<text>The Merry Wives of Windsor or Sir John Falstaff and the Merry Wives of Windsor is a comedy by William Shakespeare first published in 1602, though believed to have been written in or before 1597. The Windsor of the play&#x27;s title is a reference to the town of Windsor, also the location of Windsor Castle in Berkshire, England. Though nominally set in the reign of Henry IV or early in the reign of Henry V, the play makes no pretence to exist outside contemporary Elizabethan-era English middle-class life. It features the character Sir John Falstaff, the fat knight who had previously been featured in &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot;. It has been adapted for the opera at least ten times. The play is one of Shakespeare&#x27;s lesser-regarded works among literary critics.
Tradition has it that &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; was written at the request of Queen Elizabeth I. After watching &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, she asked Shakespeare to write a play depicting Falstaff in love.

==Characters==

* Sir John Falstaff
* Bardolph, Pistol, Nym – followers of Falstaff.
* Robin – page to Falstaff.
* Messrs. Frank Ford &amp; George (Thomas) Page – two gentlemen dwelling at Windsor.
* William Page – a boy, son to Page.
* Sir Hugh Evans – a Welsh parson
* Doctor Caius John Caius – a French physician.
* John Rugby – a servant to Doctor Caius.
* Mistress Quickly – servant to Doctor Caius.
* Robert Shallow – a Country Justice.
* Abraham Slender – cousin to Shallow.
* Peter Simple – servant to Slender.
* Fenton – a young gentleman.
* The Host of the Garter Inn
* Mistress Alice Ford
* Mistress Margaret Page
* Anne Page – Mistress Page&#x27;s daughter.
==Plot==

The play is nominally set in the early 15th century, during the same period as the &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays featuring Falstaff, but there is only one brief reference to this period, a line in which the character Fenton is said to have been one of Prince Hal&#x27;s rowdy friends (he &quot;kept company with the wild prince and Poins&quot;). In all other respects, the play implies a contemporary setting of the Elizabethan era, c. 1600.

Falstaff arrives in Windsor very short of money. He decides that, to obtain financial advantage, he will court two wealthy married women, Mistress Ford and Mistress Page. Falstaff decides to send the women identical love letters and asks his servants – Pistol and Nym – to deliver them to the wives. When they refuse, Falstaff sacks them, and, in revenge, the men tell the husbands Ford and Page of Falstaff&#x27;s intentions. Page is not concerned, but the jealous Ford persuades the Host of the Garter Inn to introduce him to Falstaff as a &#x27;Master Brook&#x27; so that he can find out Falstaff&#x27;s plans.

Meanwhile, three different men are trying to win the hand of Page&#x27;s daughter, Anne Page. Mistress Page would like her daughter to marry Doctor Caius, a French physician, whereas the girl&#x27;s father would like her to marry Master Slender. Anne herself is in love with Master Fenton, but Page had previously rejected Fenton as a suitor due to his having squandered his considerable fortune on high-class living. Hugh Evans, a Welsh parson, tries to enlist the help of Mistress Quickly (servant to Doctor Caius) in wooing Anne for Slender, but the doctor discovers this and challenges Evans to a duel. The Host of the Garter Inn prevents this duel by telling each man a different meeting place, causing much amusement for himself, Justice Shallow, Page and others. Evans and Caius decide to work together to be revenged on the Host.
When the women receive the letters, each goes to tell the other, and they quickly find that the letters are almost identical. The &quot;merry wives&quot; are not interested in the aging, overweight Falstaff as a suitor; however, for the sake of their own amusement and to gain revenge for his indecent assumptions towards them both, they pretend to respond to his advances.

This all results in great embarrassment for Falstaff. Mr. Ford poses as &#x27;Mr. Brook&#x27; and says he is in love with Mistress Ford but cannot woo her as she is too virtuous. He offers to pay Falstaff to court her, saying that once she has lost her honour he will be able to tempt her himself. Falstaff cannot believe his luck, and tells &#x27;Brook&#x27; he has already arranged to meet Mistress Ford while her husband is out. Falstaff leaves to keep his appointment and Ford soliloquizes that he is right to suspect his wife and that the trusting Page is a fool.

When Falstaff arrives to meet Mistress Ford, the merry wives trick him into hiding in a laundry basket (&quot;buck basket&quot;) full of filthy, smelly clothes awaiting laundering. When the jealous Ford returns to try and catch his wife with the knight, the wives have the basket taken away and the contents (including Falstaff) dumped into the river. Although this affects Falstaff&#x27;s pride, his ego is surprisingly resilient. He is convinced that the wives are just &quot;playing hard to get&quot; with him, so he continues his pursuit of sexual advancement, with its attendant capital and opportunities for blackmail.

Again Falstaff goes to meet the women but Mistress Page comes back and warns Mistress Ford of her husband&#x27;s approach again. They try to think of ways to hide him other than the laundry basket which he refuses to get into again. They trick him again, this time into disguising himself as Mistress Ford&#x27;s maid&#x27;s obese aunt, known as &quot;the fat woman of Brentford&quot;. Ford tries once again to catch his wife with the knight but ends up hitting the &quot;old woman&quot;, whom he despises and takes for a witch, and throwing her out of his house. Having been beaten &quot;into all the colors of the rainbow&quot;, Falstaff laments his bad luck.

Eventually the wives tell their husbands about the series of jokes they have played on Falstaff, and together they devise one last trick which ends up with the Knight being humiliated in front of the whole town. They tell Falstaff to dress as &quot;Herne, the Hunter&quot; and meet them by an old oak tree in Windsor Forest (now part of Windsor Great Park). They then dress several of the local children, including Anne and William Page, as fairies and get them to pinch and burn Falstaff to punish him. Page plots to dress Anne in white and tells Slender to steal her away and marry her during the revels. Mistress Page and Doctor Caius arrange to do the same, but they arrange Anne shall be dressed in green. Anne tells Fenton this, and he and the Host arrange for Anne and Fenton to be married instead.
The wives meet Falstaff, and almost immediately the &quot;fairies&quot; attack. Slender, Caius, and Fenton steal away their brides-to-be during the chaos, and the rest of the characters reveal their true identities to Falstaff.

Although he is embarrassed, Falstaff takes the joke surprisingly well, as he sees it was what he deserved. Ford says he must pay back the 20 pounds &#x27;Brook&#x27; gave him and takes the Knight&#x27;s horses as recompense. Slender suddenly appears and says he has been deceived – the &#x27;girl&#x27; he took away to marry was not Anne but a young boy. Caius arrives with similar news – however, he has actually married his boy. Fenton and Anne arrive and admit that they love each other and have been married. Fenton chides the parents for trying to force Anne to marry men she did not love and the parents accept the marriage and congratulate the young pair. Eventually they all leave together and Mistress Page even invites Falstaff to come with them:
&quot;let us every one go home, and laugh this sport o&#x27;er by a country fire; Sir John and all&quot;.

==Sources==

Some elements of &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; may have been adapted from &quot;Il Pecorone&quot;, a collection of stories by Ser Giovanni Fiorentino; one of these stories was included in William Painter&#x27;s &quot;The Palace of Pleasure&quot;.

==Date and text==
The play&#x27;s date of composition is unknown; it was registered for publication in 1602, but was probably several years old by that date. In the Fairy pageant in Act 5 Scene 5 (lines 54–75), Mistress Quickly, as the Queen of the Fairies, gives a long speech giving an elaborate description of the Order of the Garter. The play also alludes to a German duke, who is generally thought to be Frederick I, Duke of Württemberg, who had visited England in 1592 and was elected to the Order of the Garter in 1597 (but was eventually only installed in Stuttgart on 6 November 1603). These facts led commentators starting with Edmond Malone in 1790 to suggest that the play was written and performed for the Order of the Garter festival. William Green suggests that the play was drawn up when George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon, as Lord Chamberlain and patron of Shakespeare&#x27;s company, was elected Order of the Garter in April 1597. If this is so, it was probably performed when Elizabeth I attended Garter Feast on 23 April.

The Garter theory is only speculation, but it is consistent with a story first recorded by John Dennis in 1702 and Nicholas Rowe in 1709: that Shakespeare was commanded to write the play by Queen Elizabeth, who wanted to see Falstaff in love. This theatrical tradition was first recorded by Dennis in the prologue to his adaptation of the play, &quot;The Comical Gallant&quot;. He states that Queen Elizabeth &quot;commanded it to be finished in fourteen days.&quot; Rowe wrote that Elizabeth &quot;was so well pleased with that admirable character of &quot;Falstaff&quot;, in the two parts of &quot;Henry the Fourth&quot;, that she commanded him to continue it for one play more, and to shew him in love.&quot; T. W. Craik suggests that these stories may simply be fantasies occasioned by the Quarto&#x27;s title page which says of the play &quot;As it hath diuers times Acted...Both before her Maiestie, and else-where.&quot; Nevertheless, Carey would have been well placed to pass on the queen&#x27;s wishes to his players, which could account for the tradition.

Support for the Garter theory is divided. If it is correct, it would probably mean that Shakespeare wrote &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; between &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot;. Critics have trouble believing this for several reasons. One is that Pistol and Shallow are introduced as new characters in &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;, but in &quot;The Merry Wives&quot; their connection to Falstaff is taken for granted. Also, there are no references to any of the major events from Falstaff&#x27;s 15th-century exploits from the history plays, such as the rebellion (&quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; &amp; &quot;2&quot;), in &quot;Merry Wives&quot;. T.W. Craik suggests that Shakespeare was forced to interrupt work on &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;, having written most of it, because &quot;The Merry Wives&quot; had to be completed quickly. Another possible explanation comes from the epilogue to &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;, which promises to &quot;continue the story, with Sir John in it&quot;. Sir John does not appear in &quot;Henry V&quot;, so &quot;Merry Wives&quot; could have been written to make good on the pledge.

At least parts of the play may have been written around or before the first performances of &quot;Part 1&quot; in 1597, after which controversy over the original naming of Falstaff (he was originally the historic Sir John Oldcastle, which presumably did not please Oldcastle&#x27;s descendants) forced Shakespeare to rename the character. It appears that the joke in V,v,85–90 is that Oldcastle/Falstaff incriminates himself by calling out the first letter of his name, &quot;O, O, O!,&quot; when his fingertips are singed with candleswhich of course works for &quot;Oldcastle&quot; but not &quot;Falstaff.&quot; There is also the &quot;castle&quot; reference in IV,v,6.

18 January 1602 was the date the play was entered into the Register of the Stationers Company. The first quarto was published later that year, in an inferior text, by bookseller Arthur Johnson. It was published in a second quarto in 1619, as part of William Jaggard&#x27;s False Folio; the superior First Folio text followed in 1623.

The title page of Q1 states that the play was acted by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, &quot;Both before Her Majesty, and elsewhere.&quot; The earliest definitely dated performance occurred on 4 November 1604, at Whitehall Palace. The play is also known to have been performed on 15 November 1638, at the Cockpit in Court.

==Analysis and criticism==
Considering the Falstaff of &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; in contrast to the Falstaff portrayed in the two &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays, Mark Van Doren states: &quot;Only the husk of Falstaff&#x27;s voice is here.&quot; Harold Bloom refers to this Falstaff as &quot;a nameless impostor masquerading as the great Sir John Falstaff.&quot; He adds:

No longer either witty in himself or the cause of wit in other men, this Falstaff would make me lament a lost glory if I did not know him to be a rank impostor. His fascination, indeed, is that Shakespeare wastes nothing upon him. &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; is Shakespeare&#x27;s only play that he himself seems to hold in contempt, even as he indites it.

That Shakespeare would so stumble with one of his greatest creations is puzzling and a satisfactory reason for this remains to be found. The most obvious explanation is that it was written very quickly. Leslie Hotson wrote that &quot;it is certain that the play bears the earmarks of hasty writing.&quot;

=== Themes ===
Key themes of &quot;Merry Wives&quot; include love and marriage, jealousy and revenge, social class and wealth. Explored with irony, sexual innuendo, sarcasm, and stereotypical views of classes and nationalities, these themes help to give the play something closer to a modern-day view than is often found in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays.

The play is centered on the class prejudices of middle-class England. The lower class is represented by characters such as Bardolph, Nym, and Pistol (Falstaff&#x27;s followers), and the upper class is represented by Sir John Falstaff and Master Fenton. Shakespeare uses both Latin and misused English to represent the attitudes and differences of the people of this era. Much humour is derived from the exaggerated accents of Dr. Caius and Sir Hugh Evans. For example, Caius speaks in an exaggerated French dialect; when he finds out he has married a page instead of Mistress Anne, he exclaims that he has married &quot;oon garcon&quot;, and Evans speaks in a thick Welsh accent to the point that Falstaff complains that he &quot;makes fritters of English&quot; (5,5,135). Much of the comedic effect of the play is derived from misunderstandings among characters.

Other scholars say that the treatment of sexual jealousy in the play differs from its treatment in others, like &quot;Othello&quot; and &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;. The jealousy of Leontes and Othello is dangerous and deep-seated, while Ford&#x27;s jealousy is something to be mocked and laughed at.

==Performance history==
&quot;Merry Wives&quot; was one of the first Shakespearean plays to be performed once the theatres re-opened in 1660 after the Interregnum. Samuel Pepys saw the King&#x27;s Company act it on 5 Dec. 1660, and again in 1661 and 1667 (though he didn&#x27;t like it on any occasion). In 1702 John Dennis offered an adaptation (it has been called a &quot;perversion&quot;) of the play, titled &quot;The Comical Gallant, or the Amours of Sir John Falstaff&quot; – which flopped. In 1824 Frederick Reynolds included &quot;Merry Wives&quot; in his series of operatic adaptations, with music by Henry Bishop. Charles Kean returned to Shakespeare&#x27;s text in an 1851 production. Arthur Sullivan composed incidental music for use in Act V of an 1874 production at the Gaiety Theatre, London, which was also used in the 1889 Haymarket Theatre production.

During the period of anti-German feelings in England during World War I, many German names and titles were changed and given more English-sounding names, including the royal family&#x27;s from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor. Kaiser Wilhelm II (who as Queen Victoria and Prince Albert’s eldest grandson was a member of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha through his mother) countered this by jokingly saying that he wanted to see a command performance of &quot;The Merry Wives of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.&quot;

==Adaptations==
=== Film ===

=== Operas ===

*&quot;Les deux amies, ou le vieux garçon&quot;, music by Louis-August Papavoine (1761)
*&quot;Herne le chasseur&quot;, music by François-André Danican Philidor, libretto by Douin (1773)
*&quot;Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor&quot;, libretto by George Christian Romer, music by Peter Ritter (1794)
*&quot;Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor&quot;, libretto by George Christian Romer, music by Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf (1796)
*&quot;Falstaff,&quot; an &quot;opera buffa&quot; by composer Antonio Salieri, with a libretto by Carlo Prospero Defranceschi (1799)
*&quot;Falstaff&quot; by composer Michael William Balfe, with an Italian libretto by Manfredo Maggioni (1838)
*&quot;Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor&quot;, a singspiel, by German composer Carl Otto Nicolai (1849). The opera contains much German spoken dialogue, and many of the characters&#x27; names have been changed (the names of the Mistresses Ford and Page are now Fluth and Reich) and there is more focus given between the romance of Fenton and Anne. It is the only opera adaptation to include the disguising of Falstaff as a woman.
*&quot;Falstaff&quot;, one-act, music by Adolphe Adam, libretto by Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges and Adolphe de Leuven (1856)
*&quot;Falstaff&quot; by Giuseppe Verdi, with a libretto by Arrigo Boito, was Verdi&#x27;s last opera (1893). Some of the changes include Anne (known as Nanetta) now as the daughter of Mistress Ford rather than Mistress Page, and she is betrothed by her father to Dr. Caius alone, with Mistresses Ford and Page conspiring to aid in her elopement with Fenton. The roles of Master Page, Slender, Shallow, Sir Hugh Evans, and many others are eliminated. To flesh out Falstaff&#x27;s character, librettist Arrigo Boito adds material from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV, Part I&quot; and &quot;Part II&quot;, including the famous &quot;honour&quot; soliloquy. It is largely considered to be the best operatic adaptation of &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, as well as one of opera&#x27;s greatest comic achievements.
*&quot;Sir John in Love&quot; by English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams (1929). Much of the libretto the composer took directly from Shakespeare&#x27;s text, making it the most accurate of the operatic adaptations. This is the only opera version to retain all of the characters as well as the subplot of the duel between Dr. Caius and Sir Hugh Evans.

<text>The Fiat CR.42 &quot;Falco&quot; (Falcon, plural: &quot;Falchi&quot;) is a single-seat sesquiplane fighter developed and produced by Italian aircraft manufacturer Fiat Aviazione. It served primarily in the Italian in the 1930s and during the Second World War.

The CR.42 was an evolution of Fiat’s earlier CR.32 fighter, featuring a more powerful supercharged Fiat A.74R1C.38 air-cooled radial engine and aerodynamic improvements to its relatively clean exterior surfaces. The aircraft proved to be relatively agile in flight, a factor that had been attributed to its very low wing loading and a sometimes decisive tactical advantage. RAF Intelligence praised its exceptional manoeuvrability, further noting that &quot;the plane was immensely strong&quot;, though it was technically outclassed by faster, more heavily armed monoplanes. While primarily used as a fighter, various other roles were adopted for some variants of the type, such as the &quot;CR.42CN&quot; night-fighter model, the &quot;CR.42AS&quot; ground-attack aircraft, and the &quot;CR.42B&quot; &quot;Biposto&quot; twin-seat trainer aircraft.

During May 1939, the CR.42 entered service with the ; it was the last of the Fiat biplane fighters to enter front line service. By 10 June 1940, the date when Italy entered the Second World War, roughly 300 of the type had been delivered, which defended metropolitan cities, and important military installations at first. By the end of 1940, the Falco had been involved in combat on various fronts, including the Battle of France, the Battle of Britain, Malta, North Africa, and Greece. By the end of the war, Italian CR.42s had been used on further fronts, including Iraq, the Eastern Front and the Italian mainland. Following the signing of the Italian armistice with the Allies on 8 September 1943, the type was relegated to use as a trainer by the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force, while some Italian CR.42s were seized by the Germans and used by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; to perform ground-attack operations.

The CR.42 was produced and entered service in smaller numbers with the air forces of other nations, including Belgium, Sweden and Hungary. By the end of production, in excess of 1,800 CR.42s had been constructed, making it the most numerous Italian aircraft to be used during the Second World War. Aviation author Przemyslaw Skulski has claimed that the fighter had performed at its best during its service with the Hungarian Air Force, specifically during its deployment against Soviet forces on the Eastern Front of the war, where it reportedly achieved a kill to loss ratio of 12 to 1.

==Design and development==
===Origins===
During the late 1930s, while a new generation of monoplane fighter aircraft were already beginning to be introduced across the various air services of Europe, there was still a considerable time before they would be developed and available enough to assume total responsibility for strategic air power operations. By the outbreak of the Second World War during September 1939, many powers still fielded biplanes amongst their air wings, such as the British Gloster Gladiator and the Italian CR.42. As such, even as the first flights of the latter were being conducted during 1939, despite an acknowledgement of its effective obsolescence, it was also recognised that such biplanes would likely make a valued contribution in plentiful second-line roles. This pragmatic observation turned out to be correct as not only would the CR.42 be built in greater numbers than any other Italian fighter of the war, it would also see action on every front in which the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; fought upon.

The CR.42 was basically an evolution of the design of the earlier Fiat CR.32, which in turn had been derived from the CR.30 series created in 1932. During the Spanish Civil War of the mid-1930s, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; had employed the CR.32 and had reportedly accomplished significant successes using the fighter. The positive combat experience gave sufficient encouragement to the type&#x27;s principal manufacturer, Fiat Aviazione, for the company to produce a proposal for the development of a more advanced derivative of the design, incorporating the newly finalised supercharged Fiat A.74R1C.38 air-cooled radial engine and several other enhancements. Key features of the fighter, which was designated as the &quot;CR.42&quot;, included its relatively clean aerodynamic exterior, a very strong structure, and a high level of maneuverability, a combination which had traditionally appealed to Italian pilots according to Cattaneo.

According to aviation author Gianni Cattaneo, both the proposal and the concept of a developed biplane was well received by the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;, having placed a high value on the agility of the platform, confidence may have also been high due to prior wars in Ethiopia and Spain having been fought against relatively disorganised opposition, giving a somewhat deceptive impression of effectiveness. During its formal military evaluation, the prototype CR.42 was tested against the rival Caproni Ca.165 biplane fighter, and was judged to be the superior design, although the Ca.165 was a more modern design which boasted a higher speed, albeit at the cost of maneuverability. During flight tests, it demonstrated its ability to reach a top speed of at and at ground level. Climb rate was 1 minute and 25 seconds to and of 7 minutes and 20 seconds to .

During late 1939, by which time a major European war already seemed inevitable, the CR.42 was ordered for the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;. The type had been ordered as just a single element of the larger &quot;R&quot; plan, under which Italy was to procure 3,000 new fighter aircraft, such as the monoplane Fiat G.50 and the Macchi C.200, to equip and expand its air services. According to Cattaneo, at the outbreak of the Second World War, the CR.42 was considered to be the best biplane in service. Although the age of the biplane was noticeably already coming to a close by this point, a number of other foreign air forces expressed considerable interest in the new fighter. Once quantity production had been established, a number of early Falcos were delivered to foreign customers, even to the extent of re-directing aircraft originally intended for delivery to the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;; these customers included Belgium, Hungary and Sweden.

===Further development===
Soon after its introduction to service, Fiat developed a number of variants of the type. The &quot;CR.42bis&quot; and &quot;CR.42ter&quot; featured increased firepower, while the &quot;CR.42CN&quot; was a dedicated night fighter model, the &quot;CR.42AS&quot; was optimised for performing ground attack missions, and the &quot;CR.42B&quot; &quot;Biposto&quot; commonly served in a twin-seat trainer role. Of these, the &quot;Biposto&quot;, which was furnished with a longer fuselage than other models to enable a second seat to be placed in tandem with the pilot, became the most extensively modified of all the CR.42 variants. Its length was increased by 68 centimeters over the standard fighter, to a total of 8.94 m; the height was 23 centimeters less. Empty weight was only more, as the wheel fairings had been removed. Overall weight was 2,300 kg. Top speed was 430 km/h at 5,300 meters, only 8 km/h less. Up to 1945, a pair of machine guns were commonly fitted. About 40 aircraft were produced by Agusta and Caproni Trento.
In addition, various experimental configurations of the CR.42 was both studied and constructed for trial purposes. These included the &quot;I.CR.42&quot; (&quot;Idrovolante&quot;= seaplane) and the re-engined &quot;CR.42DB&quot;. Beginning in 1938, Fiat had worked on the I.CR.42, then gave the task to complete the project to CMASA factory in Marina di Pisa on the Tirreno sea coast. The only prototype was built in 1940. Tests started at the beginning of 1941, at the Vigna di Valle base, on Lake Bracciano, north of Rome. Top speed was 423 km/h, range was 950 km while ceiling was reduced to 9,000 m. Empty weight went from , full weight from .

The &quot;CR.42DB&quot; was an attempt to improve the type&#x27;s performance by installing a Daimler-Benz DB 601 V12 engine of . This prototype, MM 469), was flown by test pilot Valentino Cus in March 1941, over Guidonia Montecelio, near Rome. During test flights, it demonstrated its ability to attain a top speed of , as well as a maximum ceiling of and a range of . The project was cancelled as the biplane configuration did not offer any advantages over contemporary monoplane fighter designs. Although this variant never went into production, to the present day, the CR.42DB has continued to hold the distinction of being the fastest biplane to have ever flown.

Historians are still not certain exactly how many CR.42s were manufactured. The most likely estimate is thought to be 1,819 aircraft in total, including the 63 CR.42LWs (51 according to some sources) produced under &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; control, and a further 140 fighters that were produced for the various export customers for the type.

==Design==
The Fiat CR.42 was a robust and relatively clean single-seat biplane fighter aircraft; in spite of the biplane configuration of the aircraft, it was a modern, &quot;sleek-looking&quot; design, based around a strong steel and alloy structure. The CR.42 was furnished with fixed main landing gear, the legs of which were attached to the underside of the lower wing stubs; both the legs wheels were enclosed within d fairings for aerodynamic reasons. The upper wing was larger than its lower wing, a configuration known as a sesquiplane. The aircraft proved to be exceptionally agile in flight, a characteristic which had been attributed to be a result of the fighter&#x27;s very low wing loading. The very strong structure of the fighter enabled pilots to perform virtually all manoeuvres. Shortcomings of the CR.42 included its slower speed in comparison to monoplanes, and a lack of armour, firepower and radio equipment.

The CR.42 was typically powered by a single supercharged Fiat A.74R1C.38 air-cooled radial engine which, via a gearing apparatus, drove a metal three-blade Fiat-Hamilton Standard 3D.41-1 propeller of diameter. During the aircraft&#x27;s development, particular attention was paid to the design of the NACA cowling which accommodated the engine; the cowling featured a series of adjustable flaps for cooling purposes. The engine bay incorporated a fire extinguisher to be used in the event of a fire. In terms of armament, the early CR.42s were outfitted with a single 7.7 mm and one 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine gun, which was installed in the decking of the upper fuselage and fired directly through the propeller. As per Italian tradition, a counter for the rounds fired was present amongst the cockpit&#x27;s instrumentation.

The fuselage of the CR.42 was composed of a welded steel-tube triangulated framework built of light-alloy formers; while the forward fuselage was covered by metal panelling, fabric covered the exterior rear of the cockpit. The rigidly-braced wings used a structure that was constructed mainly of light duralumin alloys and steel; the leading edge was metal-skinned while the rest of the wing&#x27;s exterior was covered with fabric. The upper wing, which was the only one to be furnished with ailerons, was joined in the center and supported above the fuselage via an inverted V-shaped cabane, while the lower wings were directly attached onto the longerons within the base of the fuselage. The tail unit used a cantilever arrangement, composed of a duralumin framework and fabric covering.

===An Allied test pilot&#x27;s opinion===
Capt. Eric Brown, RN, Chief Naval Test Pilot and C.O. of the Captured Enemy Aircraft Flight, tested the Falco of &quot;Sergente&quot; Pietro Salvadori that had landed on Orfordness beach, on 11 November 1940. He reported the CR.42 was &quot;remarkably fast&quot; for a biplane, with a top speed of at . The Falco had a &quot;marginal stability which is the mark of a good fighter&quot;. Moreover, it was &quot;brilliantly manoeuvrable, an acrobatic gem, but under-gunned and very vulnerable to enemy fire&quot;.

== Operational history ==

===&quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;===

During May 1939, the Fiat CR.42 entered operational service with the Regia Aeronautica; the 53° &quot;Stormo&quot;, based at Turin Caselle Airport, was the first unit to be equipped with the type. On 10 June 1940, the date on which Italy entered the Second World War on the side of Germany, roughly 300 aircraft had been delivered. Italy had delayed its entry into the war in order to better prepare itself for combat; through the period commonly known as the Phoney War, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; activated many new squadrons and did all that was possible to speed up aircraft deliveries, including of the CR.42. Accordingly, further orders for the type were placed as a part of this expansion effort.

Upon Italy&#x27;s entry into the conflict, the &quot;Falchi&quot; were principally tasked with the defense of Italy&#x27;s cities and military installations alike, such as Regia Aeronautica airbases and &quot;Regia Marina&quot; (Italian Royal Navy) bases. To some extent, the CR.42 continued to be used in this capacity right up until the signing of the Italian armistice with the Allies. By 8 September 1943, the day on which Italy formally surrendered to the Allies, only around 60 of these aircraft were still in a flyable condition. By the end of the CR.42&#x27;s production during 1942, a total of 1,784 fighters had been constructed.

On numerous occasions, the &quot;Falco&quot; was engaged in dogfights against the British Gloster Gladiator, another biplane fighter, over Malta, and later against the British Hawker Hurricane monoplane, sometimes resulting in unexpected successes. The maneuverability of the &quot;Falco&quot; was an aspect of particular concern to the RAF pilots that faced them. Aviation author Haining observed that: &quot;A RAF Intelligence report in late October 1940 circulated to all pilots and their squadrons, with copies to Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and the War Cabinet, declared: &#x27;The manoeuvrability of the CR.42s, in particular their capacity to execute an extremely tight half roll, has caused considerable surprise to other pilots and undoubtedly saved many Italian fighters from destruction.&#x27;&quot;

====Battle of France====
On 13 June 1940, three days after entry of Italy into the war, 23 pilots from 23° &quot;Gruppo&quot; of 3° &quot;Stormo&quot; escorted a flight of ten Fiat BR.20 bombers to bomb the French naval base of Toulon. Later that day, they attacked French Air Force base of Hyères, in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region in southeastern France, hitting approximately 50 enemy aircraft on the ground and destroying at least 20 of them. Italian pilots from 151° &quot;Gruppo&quot; claimed the shooting down of a French Vought V.156F. On the same day, a CR.42 from 82a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; (13° &quot;Gruppo&quot;) took off to intercept a reconnaissance aircraft, but it failed to make contact and crashed during its landing, killing the pilot.

On 15 of June, 67 CR.42s from the same units, plus 18° &quot;Gruppo&quot; (from 3° &quot;Stormo&quot;), attacked the airfields of Southern France. 27 biplanes from 150° &quot;Gruppo&quot; strafed the airfield of Cuers-Pierrefeu, between Cuers and Pierrefeu-du-Var, with machine gun fire, causing around 15 V-156Fs to burst into flames. Seven of the Fiats giving top-cover were intercepted by Bloch MB.152s (Bloch MB.151s, according to other sources) from A.C.-3 that shot down a &quot;Falco&quot; and forced another to land. Italian pilots claimed four French fighters. Subsequently, Fiats attacked the airfields of Le Cannet-des-Maures and Puert Pierrefin, close to the border. This time the French fighter units reacted and the Fiats were attacked by Dewoitine 520s from G.C.III/6. &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; aviators claimed 8–10 air victories and many aircraft destroyed on the ground. Fiat pilots were credited with the downing of three Bloch and five Dewoitine fighters, in exchange for the loss of five &quot;Falchi&quot;.

Following the Fall of France, an Italian air group of CR.42s and BR.20 bombers operated from Belgium during October and November 1940. This task force flew some offensive operations during the later stages of the Battle of Britain, but incurred a high loss rate. Cattaneo speculated that the light losses experienced during the Battle of France had persuaded the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; that the type was considerably more effective than it was against the modern frontline fighter aircraft that it would be coming up against, and thus had encouraged this brief deployment. In the present day, the RAF Museum at Hendon, London has a CR.42 on static display from this time; this aircraft had reportedly force-landed in Suffolk with a broken oil pipe, with the pilot surviving.

====Malta====
Over the skies of Malta, the CR.42 encountered British Hurricanes for the first time on 3 July 1940. That day, Flying Officer Waters (P2614) shot down an SM.79 bomber five miles (eight kilometers) off Kalafrana, but he was soon attacked in turn by the escorting &quot;Falchi&quot;, who badly shot up his aircraft. Waters crashed on landing and his Hurricane was written off. The Hurricane pilots soon discovered that the Italian biplanes could often outmaneuver their aircraft and that this was a crucial factor in any dogfight against them.

Pilot Officer Jock Barber remembered: &quot;On my first combat, the 9 of July, I attacked the leader of a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; of Falcos, while [Flight Lieutenant] George Burges attacked an SM.79 bomber. When I shot the CR.42 at a range of , he did a flick-roll and went spinning down. I found myself engaged in dogfighting with the remaining CR.42s. This went down to about ; by then I had used up all my ammunition without much success, although I am convinced I got quite a few strikes on the leader in the initial combat. I realized pretty quickly that dogfighting with biplanes was just not on. They were so manoeuvrable that it was very difficult to get in a shot, and I had to keep diving and turning to keep myself from being shot down. George had by this time disappeared so I stuck my nose down and, with full throttle, was very thankful to get out of the way.&quot;

A week later, a dozen CR.42s from 23° &quot;Gruppo&quot; appeared in the sky over Malta for a reconnaissance. Flight Lieutenants Peter Keeble and Burges scrambled to intercept them, and the resulting action greatly impressed the Malta defenders with the CR.42″s maneuvering capability. Keeble attacked one CR.42 – probably the aircraft (MM4368) flown by &quot;Sottotenente&quot; Mario Benedetti of 74a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; that crashed, killing its pilot, but then came under attack himself by the &quot;Falchi&quot; of &quot;Tenente&quot; Mario Pinna and &quot;Tenente&quot; Oscar Abello. Keeble tried to dogfight with the Italians, but his engine was hit and his Hurricane dived into the ground at Wied-il-Ghajn, near Fort Rinella, and blew up; he was the first pilot to be killed in action at Malta. This was the first recorded air victory in the Second World War of the CR.42 against the Hurricane. Shortly after Keeble″s loss, a meeting of all the pilots and senior staff was called to discuss the best ways of countering the agile CR.42. A suggestion was made that the Hurricane should put down a bit of flaps as this might enable it to turn with the CR.42, but the only realistic proposal was to climb above these aircraft to be in an advantageous position.
Nevertheless, Cattaneo noted that the Hurricane gradually proved itself to be superior to the CR.42.

==== Night fighter operations ====
As the war went on, the CR.42 had been superseded in the day fighter role by more advanced aircraft, but found a renewed niche performing the night fighter mission. The &quot;Falco&quot; served as the main night fighter of the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;, even though it was not equipped with radar and often lacked radio equipment. Some &quot;Falco&quot; night fighters were equipped with extended exhaust pipes to hide the exhaust flame. Additionally, 2 spotlights were fitted under the wings of some of the night fighters. The first night interception was performed on the night of 13–14 August 1940 by &quot;Capitano&quot; Giorgio Graffer, when he located and opened fire on a British Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bomber that had been sent to attack Turin. When his guns jammed, Graffer rammed the bomber before bailing out. The bomber had been badly damaged and subsequently crashed into the English Channel whilst attempting to return to its base.

One of the most successful night interceptions took place on the night of 25 August 1942. That day, in an attempt to oppose RAF night intruder missions that were hammering Italian airfields, the 4° &quot;Stormo&quot; borrowed four radio-equipped CR.42s, by 208a and 238a &quot;Squadriglie&quot; of the 101° &quot;Gruppo Bombardamento a Tuffo&quot;, based at Abar Nimeir, to use them as night interceptors. According to Cattaneo, the CR.42 achieved a degree of success as a night fighter, proving itself to be effective against RAF bombers that were bombing industrial targets throughout northern Italy during 1942.

==== &quot;Corpo Aereo Italiano&quot; ====

In autumn 1940, &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; sent 18° &quot;Gruppo&quot; (of 56° &quot;Stormo&quot;) in Belgium with 83a, 85a and 95a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; equipped with CR.42s as part of the &quot;Corpo Aereo Italiano&quot;, an independent air corps for operations against Great Britain.
On 11 and 23 November 1940, multiple CR.42s flew two raids against England. &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft frequently experienced difficulties in maintaining formation flight with the slower biplanes. Even though slower, with an open cockpit, many units lacking radio, and armed with only a pair of machine guns (a pair of 12.7 mm/.5 in or a combination of former and a 7.7 mm/.303 in Breda-SAFAT), the &quot;Falchi&quot; could easily outturn the Hurricanes and the Spitfires opposing it and usually proved difficult to hit. &quot;The CR 42 turned to fight using all the aeroplane&#x27;s manoeuvrability. The pilot could get on my tail in a single turn, so tightly was he able to pull round.&quot; As the RAF intelligence report stated, the &quot;Falchi&quot; were hard targets. &quot;As I fired he half rolled very tightly and I was completely unable to hold him, so rapid were his manoeuvres. I attacked two or three more and fired short bursts, in each case the enemy aircraft half-rolled very tightly and easily and completely out-turned me. In two cases as they came out of their rolls, they were able to turn in almost on my tail and opened fire on me.&quot;

Against British monoplanes, the CR.42s were not always outclassed; one Italian pilot&#x27;s account is as follows: &quot;I engaged one of the British fighters from a range of between . Then I saw a Spitfire, which was chasing another CR.42, and I got in a shot at a range of . I realised that in a manoeuvered flight, the CR.42 could win or survive against Hurricanes and Spitfires, though we had to be careful of a sweep from behind. In my opinion, the English .303 bullet was not very effective. Italian aircraft received many hits which did no material damage and one pilot even found that his parachute pack had stopped a bullet.&quot; During the winter of 1940/1941, the CR.42s were transferred back to the Mediterranean theatre.

==== East Africa ====

While flying the Falco in Africa Orientale Italiana (A.O.I), Mario Visintini became the top biplane fighter ace of the Second World War (having achieved 16 kills) and Luigi Baron and Aroldo Soffritti became the second and third Fiat CR. 42 top scoring aces, having made 12 and 8 air victories respectively. Moreover, during that short and difficult campaign, the Fiat fighters were responsible for the destruction of a large number of RAF and South African Air Force (SAAF) aircraft, both in the air and on the ground, including a number of Hurricanes.

During 1940, three &quot;squadriglie&quot; stationed in Italian East Africa — Ethiopia, Italian Eritrea, and Italian Somaliland — were equipped with CR.42s. The 412a – the most experienced &quot;Squadriglia&quot; – was based in Gura (with the 414a &quot;Squadriglia&quot;) and in Massawa. The 413a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; was in Assab. Fighting there began in June 1940 and lasted until the autumn of 1941. The Italians met mostly British bombers and reconnaissance aircraft, destroying many of them. On 12 June 1940, 412a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; attacked nine Vickers Wellesley bombers from 47 Squadron above Asmara, and &quot;Tenente&quot; Carlo Canella claimed the first CR.42 victory in East Africa, a Wellesley that was heavily damaged and forced to crash-land. Two days later, the 412a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; again intercepted a pair of Wellesleys, this time from 14 Squadron, that were trying to bomb Massawa. &quot;Tenente&quot; Mario Visintini, for the first of his 16 air victories in East Africa, shot down the Wellesley flown by Pilot Officer Plunkett.

Dogfights usually occurred when enemy airfields were being attacked. But fierce air battles took place at the beginning of November 1940, during the British offensive against the Italian forts of Gallabat and Metemma, along the Sudan border. The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; was dominant in these fights, sometimes even against more powerful opponents. The most successful day was on 6 November when the CR.42s achieved seven confirmed victories against the Gladiators, for no losses. In the air duels fought during 1940, losses however were also suffered: at least six Fiats were destroyed and about a dozen damaged. Operations involving the CR.42 were typically hampered by wider logistical issues; the Royal Navy had prevented Italian supplies reaching East Africa and aerial transportation alone proved to be insufficient.

==== North Africa ====
It was on the North African front that the CR.42 was most extensively used. At the beginning of the war in Italian North Africa, there were 127 CR.42s from the 13° &quot;Gruppo&quot; (2° &quot;Stormo&quot;) at Castel Benito and from the 10° and 9° &quot;Gruppo&quot; of 4° &quot;Stormo&quot; in Benina, including reserve aircraft. According to some historians, it was in the North African theatre that the CR.42 performed at its best. Experienced Italian pilots, the majority of them being veterans of the Spanish Civil War, employed the exceptional manoeuvrability of the CR.42 to great effect, enabling successful attacks against RAF Gladiators, Hurricanes and Spitfires and often forcing their opponents &quot;...to adopt the tactic that Messerschmitt pilots had used against them: to avoid dogfights and to attack them with sudden dives.&quot;

Initially, the Falco was pitted against the contemporary Gloster Gladiator and Hawker Hart (the latter being operated by the South African Air Force) biplanes, as well as the Bristol Blenheim fast bombers of the RAF, opposing which they were able to achieve a measurable level of success. On 29 June, a group of CR.42s from 2° &quot;Stormo&quot; scrambled to intercept an inbound formation of Blenheims, estimated as totalling nine aircraft, that were in the process of bombing the airfield of Tobruk T2. During the ensuing engagement, the Italian pilots claimed to have shot down six of the British bombers, probably from No.113 Squadron, which that day reported as having lost three aircraft.
On 8 August 1940, in an aerial duel between comparable rivals, a flight of 16 CR.42s from 9° and 10° &quot;Gruppi&quot; of 4° &quot;Stormo&quot; were &quot;bounced&quot; by 14 Gladiators of No.80 Squadron RAF over Gabr Sàleh (about 65 kilometres southeast of El Adem and 35 kilometres east of Bir El Gubi). Four of the CR.42s were shot down while four more were force-landed and later recovered. In return, the Italian pilots claimed to have downed five Gladiators in the dogfight (three shared amongst the pilots of 10° &quot;Gruppo&quot; and two shared by the 73a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; pilots) along with two probables (the 90a &quot;Squadriglia&quot;’s Diary reported six victories), with two Gladiators actually lost (one pilot for each side was killed in action), but the combat was a nasty day for the best unit fielded in North Africa. 4° &quot;Stormo&quot; was the mainstay of Italian fighter force in Africa, and its 73a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; was the best unit, yet that day lost five CR.42s (included the ones eventually recovered). That air combat highlighted the advantages of the Gladiator over the CR.42, especially radio equipment that could permit coordinated attacks, and the Gladiator&#x27;s superior low altitude overall performance, with a markedly superior horizontal manoeuvrability over the &quot;Falchi&quot;.

The Gladiator was viewed as being superior to the Fiat in regards to its combat equipment also. The 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT could fire an effective explosive bullet, but the Gladiator&#x27;s Brownings were able to shoot 2.5 more rounds per second than the synchronized Italian machine guns. However, the CR.42 was capable of superior performance; it was much faster at about thanks to its smaller wing area, constant-speed propeller and the superior power of its engine, which could provide up to for short periods at emergency rating. The overall exchange ratio between CR.42 and Gladiator is difficult to assess, but Håkan Gustavsson and Slongo rated the Gladiator with an advantage about 1.2–1.9:1.
Eventually, on 31 October 1940, the &quot;Falchi&quot; scored their first confirmed air victories in North Africa against the Hawker Hurricane. During the air battle over Mersa Matruh &quot;Sergente Maggiore&quot; Davide Colauzzi and &quot;Sergente&quot; Mario Turchi from 368a &quot;Squadriglia&quot;, while escorting SM.79 bombers, shot down the Hurricanes of 33 Squadron that were flown by 26-year-old Canadian Flying Officer Edmond Kidder Leveille (RAF no. 40837) – who was forced to bail out but was killed when his parachute failed to deploy completely – and Flying Officer Perry St Quintin (Hurricane P3724), who made a forced landing at Qasaba with a holed fuel tank.

Notwithstanding these successes, it became increasingly evident that the Fiat CR.42 was unable to operate effectively against the more modern monoplanes of which increasingly larger numbers were being fielded. Over time, the type was able to rely only on its considerable manoeuvrability and &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; piloting skills as potential advantages against its opposition. Italian losses were, however, stemmed when the more advanced Macchi C.200 and the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 of &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 4, arrived in the theatre during April 1941. The CR.42s were progressively relegated to performing ground-attack operations instead, leaving interception duties to the more capable monoplanes.

==== Greece ====
The Fiat CR.42 was the main &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; front-line fighter when the Greco-Italian War broke out during late 1940. Sixty-four &quot;Falcos&quot; (out of 179 fighters) were deployed in air bases in Albania: in Drenovë (Korçë), with 160° &quot;Gruppo&quot; and in Tirana, with 363a, 364a and 365a &quot;Squadriglie&quot; of 24° &quot;Gruppo&quot;. In Greece, on the whole, the fighting was fairly difficult for the &quot;Falco&quot; pilots, despite an overinflated claim to have achieved a ratio kill/losses of 5.6 to 1. The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; coped with Royal Hellenic Air Force&#x27;s (RHAF) obsolete reconnaissance aircraft, such as the Breguet Br.19, without any problems, but had significant difficulties dealing with the Greek fighters such as the PZL P.24, the Bloch MB.151s and the Gloster Gladiator, the Italians suffering losses at a higher rate than they were achieving themselves, losing over 68 aircraft and shooting down just 20 in return. Two days after the start of the war, on 30 October, there was the first air battle. Some Henschel Hs126s of 3/2 Flight of 3 Observation &quot;Mira&quot; took off to locate Italian Army columns. But they were intercepted and attacked by Fiat CR.42s of 393a &quot;Squadriglia&quot;. A first Henschel was hit and crashed, killing its observer, Pilot Officer Evanghelos Giannaris, the first Greek aviator to die in the war. A second Hs 126 was downed over Mount Smolikas, killing Pilot Officer Lazaros Papamichail and Sergeant Constantine Yemenetzis. The first CR.42 victories were credited to Fernando Zanni and Walter Ratticchieri. On 4 November 1940, three CR.42s jumped three RHAF Breguet from 2 &quot;Mira&quot;, sent to attack the 3rd Julia Alpine Division retreating from a mountain pass near Metsovo. A Breguet was shot down, one crash-landed and the third returned to base, though badly shot up.

At the beginning of November, the Greeks received support by the Royal Air Force and on 4 November six Vickers Wellingtons from 70 Squadron attacked Valona. CR.42s pilots shot down two British bombers and damaged two more. Fortunes started to reverse, on 18 November, the first day of Greek army counter-attack. While a CR.42 shot down a Greek Bristol Blenheim, during a dogfight with Greek fighters, 393a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; damaged four PZL P.24s but lost three Fiats. On the same day, a flight of 20 Gladiators from RAF 80 Squadron landed in Athens. While deployed in North Africa, the CR.42 pilots had been able to achieve a clear superiority over the Gladiators but in Greece, they suffered more heavy losses. The superiority of the Gloster was achieved in part as a result of its enclosed cockpit, which was an advantage when operating in the cold winter sky, while the R/T radio allowed for the adoption of more effective tactics that made it possible to ambush the Italian CR.42 formations, as well as the superior quality of the British aces of 80 Squadron, commanded by Marmaduke Pattle. The majority of the Italian pilots shot down and killed in Greece were new arrivals, fresh from flying schools; these pilots frequently insisted on direct engagements against the more manoeuvrable British biplanes, leading to unfavourable dogfights. In the Greco-Italian War, CR.42 pilots claimed 162 kills, for the loss of 29 aircraft. By July 1943, CR.42s were still equipped by 383a &quot;Squadriglia Assalto&quot; (Ground Attack Squadron) based in Zara and in September 1943, by 392a (in Tirana) and 385a &quot;Squadriglie Autonome&quot;.

====Iraq====
During April 1941, Rashid Ali led a pro-Axis coup in Iraq. In response, British Army units began moving into the area to quell the rebellion, many of which made landfall near Basra. Germany and Italy dispatched support to Ali&#x27;s forces in the form of Messerschmitt Bf 110s, Savoia-Marchetti SM.79s and CR.42s, which were quickly put into action against the British. The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; sent 155a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; (named &quot;Squadriglia speciale Irak&quot;) equipped with the improved &quot;CR.42 Egeo&quot; version, which was furnished with a radio set and a 100-litre auxiliary tank, the latter of which increased the fighter&#x27;s operational range (typically 800 km at 380 km/h) up to 1,100 km at economical speed. In Iraq, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; was only operational for four days (28–31 May 1941), during which their aircraft were reportedly painted in Iraqi colours.

On 22 May 1941, a flight of CR.42s took off from Alghero and flew up to 900 km to Valona (one of which crashed on landing), Rhodes, Aleppo and Mosul. A total of 11 Fiat biplanes flew together with a single SM.79 and a SM.81, which served as &quot;pathfinders&quot; and transport aircraft, while a further three SM.82s transported weapons for the campaign. On 23 May, the Italian aircraft arrived in Iraq. Six days later(on 28 May according to other sources), the CR.42s, in what was to prove the final air-to-air combat of the brief campaign, intercepted and engaged a formation of RAF Blenheims, claiming two No. 94 Squadron Gladiators, with the loss of one CR.42 shot down by a Gladiator flown by Wg Cdr Wightman, close to Khan Nuqta. Three of the CR.42s were damaged during combat and were subsequently abandoned in Iraq. The seven survivors of the engagement were withdrawn with great difficulty, since the SM.79 &quot;pathfinder&quot; had been destroyed on the ground by the RAF, despite being located further away at Aleppo airfield, Syria. The Axis effort to reinforce the Iraqi insurgents was insufficient and the coup had quickly been put down; however, this contributed to the decision to invade Syria that resulted in a substantial diversion during an already critical moment for the Allies. While retreating, 164a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; CR.42s were used to defend Pantelleria.

===Royal Hungarian Air Force===
The first foreign purchaser of the CR.42 was the Royal Hungarian Air Force (MKHL), which placed orders for 52 aircraft during mid-1938. The Hungarians, while aware that the CR.42 was conceptually outdated in comparison to the newer generation of monoplanes, had considered the rapid re-equipment of their fighter component to be of vital importance. Additionally, the Italian government had expressed its willingness to forgo CR.42 delivery positions in order to expedite the re-equipment of the Hungarian units. By the end of 1939, a total of 17 CR.42s had been delivered to Hungary, where they were promptly issued to 1. &quot;Vadász Ezred&quot; (1st Fighter Wing), which began conversion from the earlier CR.32. Its two groups of two squadrons, 1./I &quot;Vadász Osztály&quot; (Fighter Group) at Szolnok and the 1./II &quot;Vadász Osztály&quot; at Mátyásföld, Budapest, received their full complement of fighters during mid-1940.
Some of the CR.42s in Hungarian service were armed with a single Gebauer GKM Machine Gun 1940.M (&quot;Gebauer Kenyszermeghajtasu Motorgeppuska&quot;, or &quot;Gebauer Positive-Driven Motor-Machine Gun&quot;); these were fixed twin-barrel guns that were driven via the crankshaft of the aircraft&#x27;s engine. In total, the MKHL ordered 70 CR.42s but, through a barter which included the exchange of a captured Yugoslavian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79, they received an additional two CR.42s during 1941. The Hungarian CR.42s were first used in combat against neighbouring Yugoslavia during April 1941. During the short conflict in the Balkans, the MKHL reportedly lost two of their CR.42s.

In mid-June, CR.42 fighters equipped several MKHL units: 1/3.&#x27;Kör ász&#x27;F.S. and 1/4.
&#x27;Szent György&#x27; F.S. both based in Budapest-Mátyásföld; 2/3. &#x27;Ricsi&#x27; F.S. (in Bustyaháza) and 2/4. &#x27;Repülö tör&#x27; F.S. (in Miskolc).
On 27 June 1941, Hungary declared war on the Soviet Union and, on that same day, Hungarian CR.42s received their baptism of fire when 2/3. Squadron escorted bomber formations against Stanislau, today Ivano-Frankivsk, in Ukraine. Ensign László Kázár was hit by Soviet anti-aircraft fire while strafing, leading to his crash landing behind enemy lines. On the same day, Sergeant Árpád Kertész, from the same unit, claimed the first victory, shooting down a Soviet reconnaissance plane. The 2/3. Squadron flew many sorties until the middle of July escorting bombers and strafing enemy airfields. They claimed six additional kills, losing a single aircraft on 12 July, when 2nd Lieutenant Gyõzõ Vámos collided in a dogfight with a Polikarpov I-16 and bailed out, surviving. On 11 August, Hungarian Fiats escorted six Caproni Ca.135s, commanded by Sen Lt Szakonyi, on their way to bomb a 2 km (6,560 ft) bridge across the Southern Bug River in the city of Nikolayev, on the Black Sea. On the way back the Capronis were intercepted by a flight of Soviet Polikarpov I-16 fighters. The escorting Hungarian CR.42s shot down five I-16s while sustaining no losses amongst their own. After the German 11th Army captured Nikolayev on 16 August, the commander of Luftflotte 4, Col Gen Lohr, decorated the successful Hungarian crews at Sutyska.

The Hungarian CR.42s were later used in the ground attack role against Soviet forces until December 1941. Although typically outclassed by more modern types, the Hungarian CR.42s scored 25 destroyed, one probable, one damaged (according to other sources they claimed 24 plus two Soviet planes in the air) and one aircraft destroyed on the ground, losing two planes to Soviet fighters. For a time, the surviving CR.42s were relegated to training roles. During spring 1944, a night assault CR.42 Squadron was formed. These aircraft were equipped with flame dampers and bomb racks for the carriage of four 50 kg bombs; however, these planes were reportedly not used operationally. The majority of Hungary&#x27;s CR.42s were lost in training accidents and strafing attacks by U.S. aircraft during 1944. It is believed that a single Hungarian &quot;Falco&quot; survived the war.

=== Belgian Air Force ===
During 1939, a mission from Belgium&#x27;s &quot;Aviation Militaire&quot; purchased a batch of 40 CR.42s for a total price of 40 million francs. On 6 March 1940, the first of these arrived in Belgium but was destroyed in a landing accident. The CR.42s were mainly delivered to the &quot;Evere Établissements Généraux de l&#x27;Aéronautique Militaire&quot;, which were responsible for their assembly. The first operational squadron, IIème &quot;Group de Chasse&quot; (Fighter Group) based at Nivelles, received its full complement of 15 while other units still awaited further deliveries. The exact quantity of CR.42s delivered to Belgium prior to the German attack on 10 May 1940 has been estimated by historians to fall between 24 and 27 aircraft, the last of which having been transported to France and lost in the railway station at Amiens. However, photographic evidence suggests that the total number of CR.42s delivered was 30. On 9 May, squadrons operating the &quot;Falchi&quot; were the 3rd &quot;Cocotte rouge&quot;, with 14, and the 4th, &quot;Cocotte Blanche&quot;, with 11 aircraft. In addition to those, the planes of Major Lamarche and two others (R.21 and R.27) in a hangar at Nivelles were not serviceable, while another was at Airfield Number 41 with mechanical trouble.

The Fiat CR.42s were first to be blooded in Belgium; after their initial encounters with the vastly superior Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, the entire contingent of Fiats was quickly overwhelmed, although the Belgian pilots fought with great skill. The Belgian CR.42s fought from the first day of the invasion, when they attacked a formation of attacking Ju 52s (from 17/KGzbV 5) in the Tongeren area, forcing one to crash-land near Maastricht. The Fiats were then jumped by the escorting Bf 109s from I./JG.1 but, thanks to their superior agility, managed to safely return to base. That day, the Belgian pilots claimed to have downed a further four German aircraft: three Do 17 bombers and a single Bf 109, while the Stukas of I./St.2 destroyed no less than 14 CR.42s at Brustem airfield.

In a total of 35 missions flown, the CR.42s downed at least five and probably even eight enemy aircraft including a Dornier Do 17, Junkers Ju 52 and the vaunted Bf 109 for a loss of two of their own. The only two confirmed Bf 109E losses were scored by Charles Goffin. After capitulation, the five surviving Fiat CR.42s were brought into a French Air Force depot in Fréjorques, where they were later found by the Germans. Their final fate is not known. Overall, the total claims made by Belgian CR.42 pilots were: eight Do 17, four Bf 109 and a single Ju 52.

===Swedish Air Force===

Sweden was the largest export customer for the CR.42. The Swedish Air Force purchased various types of Italian combat aircraft during 1939–1941, as an emergency measure enacted in response to the outbreak of the Second World War. As a consequence of the war, no other nations were willing to supply fighter aircraft to a small neutral country, while Sweden&#x27;s domestic production would be insufficient until at least 1943. Between February 1940 and September 1941, Sweden received a total of 72 CR.42s; these fighters were equipped with radio sets, armour plate behind the pilot and ski landing gear for winter operations. The Swedish aircraft were designated J 11.

The J 11s were initially assigned to the F 9 wing, responsible for the air defence of Gothenburg, but were transferred to the newly established Bråvalla Wing (F 13) in Norrköping in 1943 when F 9 received more advanced J 22 fighters. The J 11s operating from Kiruna, in the north of Sweden, were equipped with a ski undercarriage. During the spring of 1942, the J 11s of 1. Division were transferred to Luleå airfield. The J 11s scrambled several times to intercept German aircraft that violated Sweden&#x27;s borders, but usually failed to make contact with intruders. The J 11s of 2. and 3. Divisions based in Gothenburg managed to intercept intruders a few times, forcing them to leave Swedish airspace.
During their service in Swedish Air Force, the CR.42 suffered many accidents, sometimes because of the poor quality of materials that had been used by the Fiat factory. By the end of 1942, eight fighters had been lost, while 17 more had followed by the end of 1943. In total, in excess of 30 CR.42s were lost due to accidents and mechanical failure. Swedish pilots appreciated the J 11&#x27;s formidable close-in dogfighting abilities; however, they would often complain about the type&#x27;s low speed, insufficient armament and the open cockpits that were unsuited for the severe climate of Scandinavia. By 1945, the Swedish CR.42s were considered to be obsolete.

By 14 March 1945, the remaining J 11s of the F 13 wing were decommissioned for good by the Swedish Air Force. A total of 19 aircraft were sold to a civilian contractor, &quot;Svensk Flygtjänst&quot; AB, who used 13 of them as target tugs for at least one season, although the type was not well suited for the role. Another six J 11s were delivered to &quot;Svensk Flygtjänst&quot; AB as a source for spare parts. Secondhand aircraft were given Swedish civil registrations. The last J 11 was removed from the register during 1949. A single surviving Swedish &quot;Falco&quot; was preserved. It was stored at the F 3 wing; the aircraft had been deliberately &quot;hidden away&quot; with the intent of it being displayed in a future museum. Number NC.2453, marked as 9 9, is today on permanent static display in the Swedish Air Force Museum (Flygvapenmuseum) in Linköping.

=== &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; ===
Shortly following the announcement of the Italian armistice of 1943, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; took over the majority of Regia Aeronautica aircraft. Among these aircraft were a number of CR.42s. German Rüstungs-und-Kriegsproduktion Stab took control of Italy&#x27;s northern aircraft industry; consequently, an order for 200 CR.42LW (LW=&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;) was placed with Fiat for use by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. In German service, the type was used to conduct nighttime harassment operations and anti-partisan roles. A number of the captured Fiats were allocated to training divisions as well. The CR.42 was nicknamed &quot;Die Pressluftorgel&quot; or &quot;the Pneumatic Organ&quot; by &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; trainee pilots, presumably because of its profusion of pneumatic systems.

One of the German units to use the CR.42 was &quot;Nachtschlachtgruppe&quot; (NSGr.) 9, based in Udine. It was tasked with fighting against partisans in the region of the Alps, Istria and Croatia. During November 1943, the 1. &quot;Staffel&quot; received its &quot;Falchi&quot; and, in January 1944, the unit was transferred to the airfield at Caselle, near Turin, to operate against partisan units in the vicinity of the Southern Alps. On 28 January, the 2. Staffel was also equipped with the CR.42. The training of German pilots took place at a school in Venaria Reale.

During February 1944, after news of the Allies&#x27; landing at Anzio, 1.&quot;Staffel&quot; and 2.&quot;Staffel&quot;, based at Centocelle Airport in Rome, attacked Allied units in southern Latium, which were conducted mostly during moonlit night raids. NSGr9 attacked enemy troops in the Monte Cassino area. The CR.42 proved to be useful as a light bomber at night, but subsequently NSGr9 began to be equipped with the Ju 87D. 2.&quot;Staffel&quot; kept using the Fiat biplanes until mid-1944. On 31 May, the unit still had 18 &quot;Falchi&quot;, 15 of which were operational.

As a consequence of Allied raids that damaged the Fiat factory in Turin, only 150 CR.42LWs were ultimately completed, of which 112 would reach operational condition. Another German unit that used the type, both in Southern Italy and the Balkans, was &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; JG 107, which flew them as night fighters, fighter-bombers and fighter-trainers.

=== Last claimed biplane kill of history ===
The CR.42LWs equipped to the newly formed 3./NSGr 7 in Zagreb, Croatia, in April 1944. By September 1944, 2. &quot;Staffel&quot; was transferred in Croatia too (at Pleso) and the Fiats later equipped 1. &quot;Staffel&quot; also, in Graz, Austria. On 8 February 1945, ten &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; CR.42LWs of Stab and 2. &quot;Staffel&quot; of &quot;Nachtschlachtgruppe&quot; 7, took off from their base in Agram-Gorica, Croatia, to strafe the airfield at Grabovica, used by partisan forces. At the last moment, they were diverted to attack partisans northwest of Sisak, during which they were attacked by a flight of American P-38 Lightnings of the 14th Fighter Group. The American fighters shot down three Fiat biplanes, but two of the P-38s did not return to base. One of them was claimed by a German pilot, but this kill was not confirmed. According to authors Håkan Gustavsson and Ludovico Slongo, the unidentified German pilot&#x27;s claim is the last known claimed victory of a biplane to occur. There is doubt regarding the claim. The 14th Fighter Group&#x27;s unit history does not record any losses on this date by the 37th Fighter Squadron, which reported the engagement with the biplanes. The two aircraft which failed to return to base were reported as lost to ground fire during a ground sweep near Vienna, and were in the 48th Fighter Squadron.

== Variants ==

;CR.42: Early CR.42s were armed with one machine gun and one machine gun. The CR.42bis replaced the 7.7 mm with a second 12.7 mm.
;CR.42 Egeo:Equipped for service within the Aegean theater, outfitted with an extra 100 L (26.4 US gal) fuel tank in the fuselage.
;CR.42AS: A close air-support version. The two standard 12.7 mm machine guns could be supplemented with two more. There were underwing racks for two bombs. AS stands for &#x27;Africa Settentrionale.&#x27; There was an additional engine filter to prevent damage from sand which caused a loss in power, a common occurrence in North Africa, since filter-less engines could be damaged after only a few hours use.
;CR.42B:Dedicated 2 seat trainer variant with a lengthened fuselage to accommodate the 2nd cockpit.
;CR.42bis: Standard armament of two 12.7 mm machine guns mounted.
;CR.42CN: Night fighter version sometimes equipped with spotlights mounted under the wings and/or extended engine exhausts.
;CR.42ter: 2 × machine guns with two additional guns mounted in blisters under the wings.
;ICR.42: Experimental floatplane version designed by CMASA, top speed decreased by only in spite of the increase in weight.
;CR.42LW: Night harassment, anti-partisan aircraft for the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The aircraft were equipped with exhaust flame dampers, a pair of 12.7 mm machine guns and underwing racks for four 50 kg bombs. 150 were built, of which 112 were accepted into service by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;.
;CR.42 &quot;Bombe Alari&quot;: (unofficial but widely used name) Modification carried out at SRAMs (repair centers), to allow outdated fighters to be used in the ground attack role. Underwing pylons for 2 × bombs were added; often these pylons were loaded with bombs. The same modification was carried out on Fiat G.50s and Macchi C.200s.
;CR.42 two-seaters: Several Italian CR.42s were converted into two-seat communications aircraft.
;CR.42DB: One CR.42 was fitted with an early DB 601A inline engine. A speed of was attained.

== Surviving aircraft ==
* MM5701 – CR.42 on static display at the Royal Air Force Museum London in London. This was captured on 11 November 1940 when it suffered an overheated engine and was forced to land on the shingle beach at Orford Ness, Suffolk. During the summer of 1941, it was flown by the Air Fighting Development Unit in mock combat against a variety of British fighters. At the end of 1943 all testing was complete and the aircraft was marked for preservation in a future museum as a result of an earlier request of the Air Historical Branch. It was subsequently stored at several RAF facilities until 1978, when it was moved to its present home, the RAF Museum.
* 2542 – J 11 under restoration to airworthy at The Fighter Collection in Duxford, Cambridgeshire. The aircraft was lost and the pilot, Bertil Klintman, killed in a Controlled flight into terrain accident on the 13 April 1942 in Kiruna Municipality in the north of Sweden. The aircraft was one of seven flying in an exercise at very low level over snow-covered, mountainous terrain in conditions that made judging height difficult. The body of the pilot was quickly recovered, but the aircraft remained at the crash site until it was recovered in 1983.
* 2543 – J 11 on static display at the Swedish Air Force Museum near Linköping, Östergötland.
* Reconstruction – CR.42 on static display at the Italian Air Force Museum in Bracciano, Lazio. It is made up of 60% original parts. It is in Italian colours as &quot;MM4653&quot;, and is in fact is a composite built up with the help of parts recovered in Sweden, Italy and France.

<text>The Royal Italian Air Force (Regia Aeronautica Italiana) (RAI) was the air force of the Kingdom of Italy. It was established as a service independent of the Royal Italian Army from 1923 until 1946. In 1946, the monarchy was abolished and the Kingdom of Italy became the Italian Republic, whereupon the name of the air force changed to &quot;Aeronautica Militare&quot;.

==History==

===Beginnings===
At the beginning of the twentieth century, Italy was at the forefront of aerial warfare: during the colonization of Libya in 1911, it made the first reconnaissance flight in history on 23 October, and the first ever bombing raid on 1 November.

During World War I, the Italian &quot;Corpo Aeronautico Militare&quot;, then still part of the &quot;Regio Esercito&quot; (Royal Army), operated a mix of French fighters and locally built bombers, notably the gigantic Caproni aircraft. The (Royal Navy) had its own air arm, operating locally built flying boats.

=== Founding of the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; ===
The Italian air force became an independent service—the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;—on 28 March 1923. Benito Mussolini&#x27;s fascist regime turned it into an impressive propaganda machine, with its aircraft, featuring the Italian flag colors across the full span of the undersides of the wings, making numerous record-breaking flights.
Between 1 April 1939 and 1 November 1939, Italian airmen established no fewer than 110 records, winning world championships in round trips, long-range flights, high speed and altitude flights. After successful long-range flights around the Mediterranean Sea, Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s successful transatlantic flight in the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; inspired the Regia Aeronautica to embark on a longer transatlantic voyage with stops in West Africa and Brazil. Possibly the most brilliant successes were the floatplane world speed record of 709 km/h (440.6 mph) achieved by Francesco Agello in the Macchi-Castoldi MC-72 in October 1934 and the long-range formation flight to the United States and back to Italy in 1933, a total of 19,000 km (11,800 miles) with Savoia-Marchetti S.55 flying boats. This Decennial Air Cruise included stops in Amsterdam, Derry, Reykjavík, Labrador, Montreal, Chicago, Brooklyn, and Washington D.C., with the highlight being a landing in Lake Michigan in front of Chicago Navy Pier and a procession through the city before crowds of thousands of Americans to coincide with the Century of Progress Exhibition. This pioneering achievement was organized and led by General of Aviation Italo Balbo.
During the latter half of the 1930s, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; participated in the Spanish Civil War, as well as the invasions of Ethiopia and Albania.

===Ethiopian war===
The first test for the new Italian Royal Air force came in October 1935,
with the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. During the final stages of the war, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; deployed up to 386 aircraft, operating from Eritrea and Somalia. The Italian aviators did not have any opposition in the air, as the Imperial Ethiopian Air Force had just 15 transport and liaison aircraft, only nine of which were serviceable. However, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; lost 72 planes and 122 aircrew while supporting the operations of the &quot;Regio Esercito&quot;, sometimes dropping poison gas bombs against the Ethiopian army. After the end of hostilities on 5 May 1936, for the following 13 months the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; had to assist Italian forces in fighting Ethiopian guerrillas.

===Spanish Civil War===

During the Spanish coup of July 1936, Italian pilots in Spanish Foreign Legion uniforms airlifted Francisco Franco&#x27;s Army of Africa from Spanish Morocco to the Spanish mainland. During the Spanish Civil War Italian pilots fought alongside Spanish Nationalist and German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; pilots as members of the &quot;Aviazione Legionaria&quot; (&quot;Aviation Legion&quot;). This deployment took place from July 1936 to March 1939 and complemented an expeditionary force of Italian ground troops called the &quot;Corps of Volunteer Troops&quot;. In Spain, the Italian pilots were under direct command of the Spanish Nationalists and took part in training and joint operations with the pilots of the German &quot;Condor Legion&quot;.
Mussolini sent to Spain 6000 aviation personnel as well as about 720 aircraft, including 80-90 Savoia-Marchetti SM 81, 100 Savoia Marchetti SM.79 bombers and 380–400 Fiat CR.32 biplanes that dominated the air, proving superior to the Soviet Polikarpovs of the Spanish Republican Air Force. The &quot;Aviazione legionaria&quot; achieved approximately 500 aerial victories, losing 86 aircraft in air combat and about 200 flying personnel.
But more important than the material losses were the wrong conclusions drawn from air war in Spain. The Air Ministry, blinded by the success of the Fiat CR.32, persisted in its belief that the biplane could still dominate the sky, and ordered large numbers of Fiat CR.42 Falcos, the last war biplane in history.

===Albania===
The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; played a limited role during the Italian invasion of Albania in 1939.

===World War II===

In July 1939, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; was seen as splendid air arm, holding no fewer than 33 world records, which was more than Germany (15), France (12), the United States (11) Soviet Union (7), Japan (3), the United Kingdom (2) and Czechoslovakia(1). When World War II began in 1939, Italy had a paper strength of 3296 machines. While numerically still a force to be reckoned with, it was hampered by the local aircraft industry which was using obsolete production methods. In reality, only 2000 aircraft were fit for operations, of which just 166 were modern fighters (89 Fiat G.50 Freccias and 77 Macchi MC.200s), both slower than potential opponents as the Hawker Hurricane, the Supermarine Spitfire and the Dewoitine D.520. The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; also had neither long-range fighters or night fighters. 
Technical assistance provided by its German ally did little to improve the situation.

====Battle of France====

On 10 June 1940, during the closing days of the Battle of France, Italy declared war on France and the United Kingdom. On 13 June, Fiat CR.42s attacked French Air Force bases and escorted Fiat BR.20s that bombed the harbour of Toulon. Two days later, CR.42s from 3° &quot;Stormo&quot; and 53° &quot;Stormo&quot; attacked again French air bases and clashed with Dewoitine D.520s and Bloch MB.152s, claiming eight kills for five losses. But when a small French Navy fleet shelled the Ligurian coast on 15 June, the Italian air force was not able to prevent this action or attack the French ships effectively, showing a lack of cooperation with the , Italian navy. The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; carried out 716 bombing missions, with Italian aircraft dropping a total of 276 tons of bombs on French fortifications, military bases, and airfields (some of the targets being Toulon, Briançon, Traversette, and Cap San Martin); during this short war, &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; lost 10 aircraft in aerial combat and 24 aircrew personnel, while claiming 10 kills and 40 French planes destroyed on the ground. According to a book published after the war by &quot;Generale&quot; Giuseppe Santoro, critical of the unplanned use of the Air Force, which had not been prepared for operations of aerial bombing against fortifications, only about of the bombs were dropped on the targets. Despite this misuse of resources, the bombing missions made possible and supported the limited Italian advance into southern France by the &quot;Regio Esercito&quot;, with the Italian air force retaining its fame until the Battle of Britain showed its limitations.

After the war, there was a widespread rumour in France, especially between Paris and Bordeaux, of Italian aircraft strafing civilian columns, with many people claiming to have seen the tricolour roundels painted on them. These allegations have been disproved, as the Italian aircraft did not have the range to hit such distant targets and concentrated on short-range military objectives (&quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; wing roundels had three &quot;fasci littori&quot;, having replaced the tricolour ones). It was concluded that this was nothing more than a myth, arising from the reaction to the Italian attack, the fame of the Italian air force and the heated and confused climate.

====Middle East====

&quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; aircraft were involved in the Middle Eastern theatre almost from the start of Italian involvement in World War II. During the Anglo-Iraqi War, German and Italian aircraft of &quot;Flyer Command Iraq&quot; (&quot;Fliegerführer Irak&quot;) stopped to refuel in the Vichy French-controlled Mandate of Syria as they flew to Iraq. These masqueraded as Iraqi Air Force aircraft and were painted as such &quot;en route&quot;. Continued concern over German and Italian influence in the area led to the Allies&#x27; Syria-Lebanon Campaign.

In one of the lesser known incidents of the war, starting in July 1940, Italian aircraft bombed cities in the British Mandate of Palestine. This was aimed at pushing the British back and retaking the greater Mediterranean, as in ancient Roman times. The bombing of Tel Aviv on 10 September killed 137 people. In mid-October, the Italians also bombed American-operated oil refineries in the British Protectorate of Bahrain.

====East Africa====
In Italian East Africa the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; performed better than in other war theaters. 
In June 1940, the Italian Royal Air Force had here 195 fighters, bombers and reconnaissance aircraft, plus 25 transport planes. Some of these aircraft were outdated, but the Italians had Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 (12 examples) and Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 bombers and Fiat CR.42 fighters. In relative terms, these were some of the best aircraft on hand to either side at the beginning of the East African Campaign. In addition, the Italian aircraft were often based at better airfields than those of the British and Commonwealth forces. When the war began, Italian pilots were relatively well trained and confident of their abilities. At the beginning of the hostilities, &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; achieved aerial superiority and occasionally skilled Italian pilots, flying their Fiat biplanes, managed to shoot down even the faster and better armed Hawker Hurricane monoplanes. However, during the first three months, &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; lost 84 aircraft and had 143 aircrew personnel killed and 71 wounded, but the losses did not halt Italian operations. Cut off from Italy as they were though, problems with lack of fuel, munitions, spare parts and replacements became a serious problem and the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; was worn down in a war of attrition. By 31 January, Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, reported that the Italian military forces in East Africa were down to 67 operational aircraft with limited fuel.
By the end of February, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; had only 42 aircraft left in East Africa, and the British now had the upper hand. In March, surplus personnel of air force units had to fight as infantry. By the end of the following month, Italians had only 13 serviceable aircraft left in East Africa.
At last, on 24 October 1941, about one month prior to the final Italian surrender, the last Italian aircraft of the campaign, a Fiat CR.42, was shot down.

====Battle of Britain====
On 10 September 1940, an independent air corps for supporting &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in the Battle of Britain was established. It was named &quot;Corpo Aereo Italiano&quot;, or CAI. It was under command of &quot;Generale&quot; Rino Corso Fougier. It comprised 
approximately 170 aircraft including 80 Fiat Br.20 bombers and 98 Fiat G.50 Freccia and CR.42 fighters. The transfer of the planes was completed by 19 October. The CAI was based in Nazi-occupied Belgium. Bad weather and planes inadequate to that war theater hindered effective action by the CAI.
The CR.42s clashed with British Hawker Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfires just two times, in November. The Italians claimed five victories and nine probables, but five Fiat biplanes were shot down. The RAF, however, reported no losses. 
The 17 bombing raids carried out by the BR.20s did not cause much material damage, moreover aircraft were needed on the Greek front and in Cyrenaica so in January 1941 the bombers and CR.42s started to be withdrawn to Italy. Just two squadrons of G.50s remained until mid-April 1941. During this campaign, &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; lost 36 planes, (including 26 in accidents) and 43 aircrew personnel, without achieving a single confirmed air victory.

====Western Desert====

Initially, the Western Desert Campaign was a near equal struggle between the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; and the British Royal Air Force (RAF). Early on, the fighters available to both sides were primarily older biplanes, with Italian Fiat CR.32 and Fiat CR.42s flying against British Gloster Gladiators.

After the Italian disasters during Operation Compass and the arrival of General Erwin Rommel and his German Africa Corps, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; fought side by side with the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in the Western Desert.

Although the air campaign in Libya was seriously limited because of desert conditions, the Italian Royal Air Force managed to retain a force of nearly four hundred airplanes. During the first British counter-offensive, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; had suffered heavy losses (over 400 aircraft) until the Axis attack on Greece began, when a major part of the British land and air forces were diverted there giving the Italian forces time to recover. New Italian aircraft and units were supplemented by the arrival of the German Afrika Korps, and the attached Luftwaffe contingent deployed almost 200 airplanes in Libya and another 600 in Sicily. Working with the Luftwaffe, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; performed better due to the exchange of tactical doctrine and the arrival of more modern aircraft. 
In mid-1942, during the Battle of Bir Hakeim (26 May 1942 – 11 June 1942) the new Macchi C.202 fighter outperformed all of the Desert Air Force&#x27;s fighters, achieving an unprecedented ratio kill/loss of 4.4/1, better than that of famed Messerschmitt Bf 109s (3.5/1) fighting the same battle.
During Rommel&#x27;s first offensive, the Italians managed to divert RAF attacks from his forces and covered his retreat during the British Operation Crusader, while inflicting heavy losses on RAF bombers.

During Rommel&#x27;s second offensive, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; and the Luftwaffe suffered considerable losses due to stronger Allied resistance during air battles over El Alamein and bombing raids over Alexandria and Cairo.
The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;, having suffered heavy losses in Egypt, was withdrawn progressively to Tobruk, Benghazi, Tripoli and, eventually, Tunisia.

====Malta====
The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; participated in the air offensive on the British controlled island of Malta along with the German Air Force in an attempt to protect the Axis sea routes from Sicily, Sardinia, and Italy to North Africa. 
Up to the end of 1940, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; carried out 7410 sorties against the island, dropping 550 tons of bombs, but losing 35 aircraft. The Italians claimed 66 British planes in these first six months of combat, but these claims were exaggerated.
In 1941, &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; carried out further attacks on Malta, but less intensely than in 1940. The Italian airmen started to fear Maltese fighters and AA artillery, so much that the flight to the besieged island became known as the &quot;rotta della morte&quot;, the &quot;route of death&quot;. 
In 1942, for its operations against Malta, between 1 January and 8 November, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; had 100 more aircraft lost in action.

Malta suffered heavy loss of equipment, ship, and vehicles, and was to the edge of starvation. However the besieged island managed to withstand the attacks from the Italian and German air forces and claimed almost 1,500 Axis planes, three times the real losses: up to November 1942, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; admitted to losing 357 aircraft and the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; 210. But during the siege, the RAF&#x27;s losses were even heavier, amounting to 547 in the air (including some 300 fighters) and 160 on the ground, plus 504 aircraft damaged in the air and 231 on the ground.

====Gibraltar====
The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; began its attacks on the British crown colony of Gibraltar and its important naval base from July 1940. 
In 1942, Italian Piaggio P.108 bombers attacked Gibraltar from Sardinia, flying a number of long-range night raids.
Up to October 1942, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; carried out 14 raids with a total of 32 bombers. 

The last raids on Gibraltar were flown during the 1943 Allied landing in Algeria, when those bombers also made a successful strike on the port of Oran.
The only unit of the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; to fly the Piaggio P.108 was the 274th Long-Range Bombardment Group, which was formed in May 1941 as the first machines came off the assembly lines. Training and achieving full operation strength took far longer than anticipated, and the 274th only became operational in June 1942.

====Greece and Yugoslavia====
When the Greco-Italian War started on 28 October 1940, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; fielded 193 combat aircraft, which initially failed to achieve air superiority against the Royal Hellenic Air Force (RHAF), which had 128 operational aircraft out of a total of 158. The poor infrastructure for Albania air bases hindered communications and movements between the Italian flying units. Only two airfields – Tirana and Valona – had macadam runways, so autumn and winter weather made operations more difficult. There was also the usual lack of co-operation between the Italian Navy and Army. Finally, just few days after the start of the war, Italian pilots were confronted by No. 80 Squadron, led by the outstanding ace Marmaduke Pattle and equipped with Gloster Gladiators, No. 30 Squadron, No. 211 Squadron and No. 84 Squadron with Bristol Blenheims, and No. 70 Squadron with Vickers Wellingtons. Gradually, Italian air power (including &quot;Squadriglie&quot; flying from Italian air bases) grew to over 400 aircraft against the dwindling numbers of the Greeks. However, this advantage did not stop the Hellenic Army from forcing the &quot;Regio Esercito&quot; onto the defensive and back into Albania. In early 1941, the tide was turned as the German Wehrmacht launched its simultaneous invasions of Yugoslavia and Greece.

For the 11-day campaign against Yugoslavia, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; deployed 600 aircraft, claimed five air victories (plus 100 planes destroyed on the ground) and suffered five losses. However, from that point on, the role of the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; in the Balkans Campaign was primarily that of supporting the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. 
This support role continued during the occupation of Greece and Yugoslavia that followed.

The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; claimed 218 aircraft shot down plus 55 probables against the RHAF and RAF, while the Greeks claimed 68 air victories (plus 23 probables) and the British 150 kills. Actually the air war against Greece cost the Italians just 65 losses (but 495 damaged) while RAF losses in the Greek campaign were 209 aircraft, 72 in the air, 55 on the ground, and 82 destroyed or abandoned during the evacuation.

====Eastern Front====

In August 1941 the Regia Aeronautica sent an Air Corps of 1,900 personnel to the Eastern Front as an attachment to the &quot;Italian Expeditionary Corps in Russia&quot; (&quot;Corpo di Spedizione Italiano in Russia&quot;, or CSIR) and then the &quot;Italian Army in Russia&quot; (&quot;Armata Italiana in Russia&quot;, or ARMIR) were known as the &quot;Italian Air Force Expeditionary Corps in Russia&quot; (&quot;Corpo Aereo Spedizione in Russia&quot;). These squadrons, initially consisting of &quot;22° Gruppo&quot; CT with 51 Macchi C.200 fighters and &quot;61° Gruppo &quot; with the Caproni Ca.311 bomber, supported the Italian armed forces from 1941 to 1943. They were initially based in the Ukraine and ultimately supported operations in the Stalingrad area. In mid 1942 the more modern Macchi C. 202 was introduced to operations in Russia. The CSIR was subsumed by the ARMIR in 1942 and the ARMIR was disbanded in early 1943 after disaster during the Battle of Stalingrad. The Air Corps pulled out of operations in January 1943, transferring to Odessa.

From 1944 to 1945, Italian personnel operated from the Baltic area and in the northern part of the Eastern Front under the direct command of the Luftwaffe under the name Air Transport Group 1 (Italian: &quot;1° Gruppo Aerotrasporti &quot;Terracciano&quot; &quot;, German: &quot;1° Staffel Transportfliegergruppe 10 (Ital)&quot;). This group was part of the National Republican Air Force of the Italian Social Republic.

==== Tunisian Campaign ====

By the time of the Tunisian Campaign, the Regia Aeronautica and the Luftwaffe rarely enjoyed parity let alone air superiority in North Africa.

==== Sicilian Campaign and before 8 September 1943 ====
The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; was forced on the defensive during the Sicilian Campaign. Italian pilots were constantly fighting against Allied efforts to sink &quot;Regia Marina&quot; ships. Just before the Allied invasion, a huge Allied bomber offensive struck the airfields in Sicily in an effort to gain further air superiority. This left the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; very weak, but aircraft continued to arrive from Sardinia, southern Italy, and southern France.
The last mission of the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; before the truce with the Allies was the defence during the United States Army Air Forces&#x27; bombings of Frascati and Rome on 8 September 1943.

==== Post-armistice ====

After the Italian armistice, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; was briefly succeeded by two new Italian air forces. Headquartered at Salerno in southern Italy, the Royalist Italian Co-belligerent Air Force (&quot;Aviazione Cobelligerante Italiana&quot;, or ACI) fought alongside the Allied forces. In northern Italy, the National Republican Air Force (&quot;Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana&quot;, or ANR) flew for the Italian Social Republic and the Axis. The first ANR fighter unit was the 101st &quot;Gruppo Autonomo Caccia Terrestre&quot;, based in Florence.
Aircraft of the Royal and Republican air forces never fought each other. The ACI operated in the Balkans and the ANR in northern Italy and the area around the Baltic Sea.

From 10 June 1940 up to 8 September 1943, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; lost 6483 aircraft (other sources report 5201), including 3483 fighters, 2273 bombers, torpedo-bombers and transports, plus 227 reconnaissance planes. The Royal Italian Air Force itself claimed 4293 enemy aircraft, including 1771 destroyed on the ground.
Personnel losses suffered during the conflict consisted of 3007 dead or missing, 2731 wounded and 9873 prisoners of war.

====Regia Aeronautica Aces (World War II)====

The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; tended not to keep statistics on the individual level, instead reporting kills for a certain unit, attributed to their unit commander. However, pilots were able to keep personal log books, so the few that survived through World War II give individual statistics. Here is a list of the aces attributed with ten or more kills:
* Teresio Vittorio Martinoli – 22 kills
* Franco Lucchini – 22 kills (1 in Spain)
* Leonardo Ferrulli – 21 kills (1 in Spain)
* Franco Bordoni-Bisleri – 19 kills
* Luigi Gorrini – 19 kills
* Mario Visintini – 17 kills
* Ugo Drago – 17 kills
* Mario Bellagambi – 14 kills
* Luigi Baron – 14 kills
* Luigi Gianella – 12 kills
* Attilio Sanson – 12 kills
* Willy Malagola – 11 Kills
* Carlo Magnaghi – 11 kills
* Angelo Mastroagostino – 11 kills
* Giorgio Solaroli di Briona – 11 kills
* Mario Veronesi – 11 kills
* Fernando Malvezzi – 10 kills
* Giulio Reiner – 10 kills
* Giuseppe Robetto – 10 kills
* Carlo Maurizio Ruspoli di Poggio Suasa – 10 kills
* Massimo Salvatore – 10 kills
* Claudio Solaro – 10 kills
* Ennio Tarantola – 10 kills
* Giulio Torresi – 10 kills

<doc id="201704" wikidata="Q549217" url="?curid=201704" title="Neverwinter Nights (2002 video game)">
<text>Neverwinter Nights is a role-playing video game developed by BioWare. Interplay Entertainment was originally set to publish the game, but financial difficulties led to it being taken over by Infogrames, who released the game under their Atari range of titles. It is the first installment in the&quot; Neverwinter Nights&quot; series and was released for Microsoft Windows on June 18, 2002. BioWare later released a Linux client in June 2003, requiring a purchased copy of the game to play. MacSoft released a Mac OS X port in August 2003.

&quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; is set in the fantasy world of the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; campaign setting, with the game mechanics based on the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd edition rules. The game engine was designed around an Internet-based model for running a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG), which would allow end users to host game servers. Up to 64 players could connect to a single server. The intent was to create a potentially infinite massively multiplayer game framework. This game was named after the original &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; online game, the first graphical massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), which operated from 1991 to 1997 on AOL.

The original release of &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; includes the game engine, a game campaign that can be played as single player or in multiplayer mode, and on Windows releases, the Aurora toolset used for creating custom content that would run in the same engine. Three expansion packs were subsequently released for the game: &quot;Shadows of Undrentide&quot; in June 2003; &quot;Hordes of the Underdark&quot; in December 2003; and &quot;Kingmaker&quot; in November 2004. BioWare began selling premium modules through an online store in late 2004. The game&#x27;s success led to a sequel, &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2&quot;, released on October 31, 2006.

==Development and release==

The game was developed by 65 people. Development time was more than a year and the project had a multi-million dollar budget. The game was announced to use the Omen engine as a replacement for the Infinity engine which was not good enough for the new game.

BioWare intended to create a game system which emulated the interactions in a pen-and-paper version of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; including the role of Dungeon Master. They worked alongside the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; to ensure the game framework was faithful to the tabletop game.

A posting at the &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2&quot; Vault on June 4, 2008 contained information from what appeared to be original &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; documentation. At the BioWare forums, &quot;Neverwinter&quot; lead designer Rob Bartel confirmed that the &quot;series of excerpts from the game&#x27;s design doc&quot; were not a hoax. When asked if the plans were altered due to time constraints, Bartel referenced various legal difficulties that the company was working through.

The game was released for Windows in North America on June 18, 2002, in Europe on June 28, and in Australia on July 3. Sega released the game as its publisher on March 20, 2003. A Linux client for the game was made available on June 19, 2003. A Mac OS X port published by MacSoft was released in North America on July 30, 2003, and in Europe later the same year.

==Gameplay==
The original scenario supplied with the &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; is the campaign. It comprises approximately sixty hours of gameplay. The gameplay centers on the development of a player character (PC) through adventuring, who ultimately becomes the hero of the story. The PC is tasked with defeating a powerful cult, collecting four reagents required to stop a plague, and thwarting an attack on the city of Neverwinter, located along the Sword Coast of Faerûn, in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. The first and final chapters of the campaign deal with the city of Neverwinter itself, but the lengthy mid-story requires the player to venture into the surrounding countryside and travel northward to the city of Luskan. Along the way, many optional side quests are made available.

As in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; tabletop game, the first thing a player must do is create a new character. The game provides a set of ready-made characters, or the player may create one from scratch. A series of panels are presented for selection of the character&#x27;s gender, race, character class, alignment, ability scores (such as strength and intelligence), specialized abilities called skills and feats, in-game appearance, and name. This process grants significant allowance for customization; one can be, for example, an outdoorsman (ranger) or a healer (cleric), then choose skills and feats that would work well with that class in the game.

Following a small prelude, there are four chapters in the original game, with each chapter following part of the general storyline. Within each chapter, there are many quests, subquests, and mini-storylines provided to the player. Depending on the specific quests completed, and the unique items kept, some storylines are continued throughout the entire game, such as the Henchman&#x27;s or Aribeth&#x27;s tales. Completing many of the side quests will give the player&#x27;s character more experience and special items, making them improve more rapidly and continue to make the game easier as the player progresses. These improvements come in the form of levels earned through experience points, with each level providing the protagonist with a set of enhancements as selected by the player.

The game&#x27;s mechanics are based on the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd edition rule set; the outcome of most actions, such as combat and skills usage, are randomly determined by dice rolls. For example, when a fighter attacks, the computer would digitally &quot;roll&quot; a 20-sided die (called a d20 in-game) to determine if he hits the target. On a success, another die is rolled to determine the damage dealt, with powerful weapons assigned to dice with a greater number of sides, due to their ability to do more damage. Although the outcome of nearly all actions is determined by dice rolls, the player does not see them, with the results calculated in the background. However, the player has the option to display the outcomes of these rolls. The player can control the game almost entirely via the mouse.

===Multiplayer===
A robust multiplayer component separates &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; from previous &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; games, as this allows players to play on many different servers hosting games. Depending on hardware and bandwidth, each server can support up to ninety-six players on the same server application, plus Dungeon Masters (DM) to run the games, if desired. &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; game modules are run in a variety of genres and themes, including persistent worlds (which are similar to MUD), combat arenas (player versus player modules), whole servers dedicated to sexually oriented roleplay,
 and simple social gatherings similar to a chat room. BioWare requires that these persistent worlds be free of charge, primarily for reasons of copyright law.

Because &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; lacks a global chat function aside from the supported GameSpy, players typically join pickup games through the game&#x27;s multiplayer interface, or schedule games in advance with friends. Matchmaking sites can facilitate scheduling of games, and the experience is much like traditional pen-and-paper role-playing games. Persistent worlds do this work for them by inviting players to visit their website and continue to roleplay there.

An important feature of &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; is the Dungeon Master Client: a tool that allows an individual to take the role of the Dungeon Master, who guides the players through the story and has complete control of the server. Previous games such as &quot;&quot;, based on the printed gamebooks by White Wolf Publishing, utilized this feature to a limited extent. When it was released, &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; was viewed as the first successful implementation of the feature. The DM Client allows players to participate in regular campaigns, while also allowing persistent world servers to flourish by permitting the DMs of those servers to take control of non-player characters (NPCs) in mid-game for added realism and flexibility. The Dungeon Master Client also permits the user to spawn and control masses of monsters and NPCs much in the same way as units would be controlled in a real-time strategy game.

===Custom content===
&quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; ships with the Aurora toolset, which allows players to create custom modules for the game. These modules may take the form of online multiplayer worlds, single player adventures, character trainers or technology demos. Additionally, several third party utilities have further expanded the community&#x27;s ability to create custom content for the game. By the end of 2002, there were over 1,000 custom adventures available.

Custom content creators are known as builders in the &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; community. The Aurora toolset allows builders to create map areas using a tile system; the appearance and surface textures of the area are defined by the area&#x27;s selected tileset. Builders can overlay placeable objects onto areas, and use the built-in scripting language NWScript, which is based on the C programming language, to run cut scenes, quests, mini-games and conversations. Third party utilities allow builders to create custom content for most aspects of the game, ranging from new playable races and character classes to new tilesets, monsters and equipment. Custom content is added to the game in the form of hakpaks. Builders have used the Aurora toolset in combination with hakpaks to create playing experiences beyond the scope of the original campaign. Additionally, the Aurora toolset has allowed for the creation of a number of ongoing persistent worlds modules.

Despite the game&#x27;s age, the &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; custom content community remains active. The community, mostly centered on the Neverwinter Vault, has created over 4,000 modules for the game, among them, many award-winning adventures and series such as &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot;. The Aurora toolset is not available for the Linux and Macintosh versions of &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;. The open source project neveredit aims to port the toolset features to these platforms. The game&#x27;s module-making legacy was continued by &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2&quot;.

==Plot==
The story begins with the player character (PC), the protagonist of the story, being sent to recover four creatures (dryad, intellect devourer, yuan-ti, and cockatrice) known collectively as the &quot;Waterdhavian creatures&quot; under the guidance of Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande. The Waterdhavian creatures are needed to make a cure for the Wailing Death, a plague that is sweeping the city of Neverwinter and forcing a quarantine. With the help of Fenthick Moss, Aribeth&#x27;s love interest, and Desther, Fenthick&#x27;s friend, the PC is able to retrieve the creatures. As they collect the creatures, they are attacked by mysterious assassins from a cult that is behind the spreading of the plague.

As the cure is being made, Castle Neverwinter is attacked by the minions of Desther, who betrays the heroes. Desther takes the completed cure and escapes the castle, with the hero and Fenthick in pursuit. When they catch up to Desther, he surrenders after a short battle. Desther is sentenced to burn at the stake, and Fenthick, despite being unaware of Desther&#x27;s true intentions, is sentenced to hang. The protagonist meets up with Aribeth and Neverwinter&#x27;s spymaster, Aarin Gend, to begin searching for the cult responsible for the plague and the attack on Neverwinter. The PC retrieves the diaries of dead cultists and letters from a person named Maugrim Korothir, which convince Aribeth that the cult&#x27;s headquarters are in Luskan. Aribeth goes ahead to Luskan, and the hero follows after speaking once more to Gend.

After arriving in Luskan, the protagonist hears rumors that Aribeth has defected and joined the cultists. These fears are confirmed when she is found meeting with Maugrim and Morag, Queen of the reptilian Old Ones. They seek a group of magical relics called the Words of Power. The protagonist retrieves all of the Words of Power except for one held by the cult. The hero discovers that the Words open a portal to a pocket world inside the Source Stone, where Morag and the other Old Ones sealed themselves long ago to avoid extinction during a primordial ice age. The protagonist confronts Aribeth, and depending on how the meeting is handled, she either surrenders to the PC or they are forced to kill her. The hero battles Maugrim for the final Word, then uses the Words to enter the Source Stone and battle with Morag. After Morag&#x27;s death, the protagonist escapes the Stone as the world inside it implodes.

==Reception==
===Sales===
For the launch of &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;, publisher Infogrames shipped 1 million copies to stores, with half allocated to North America and the rest to international markets. In an experimental move, the company priced the game at $55, an increase over the $50 typical of computer games at the time. CNN Money columnist Chris Morris reported that &quot;gamers complained loudly about&quot; this decision. The game proceeded to sell 125,000 copies by June 27, after its release on the 18th. It debuted at #1 on The NPD Group&#x27;s computer game sales chart during the June 16–22 period, and held the position for two weeks, before being displaced by &quot;Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos&quot;. However, &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; continued to place in the chart&#x27;s top 10 consistently for its first three months of release. By July 23, the game&#x27;s global sales had surpassed 200,000 units. NPD reported North American sales of 330,000 copies by late December, which brought in revenues of $18 million. It was ultimately the region&#x27;s 11th-best-selling computer game of 2002.

Greg Zeschuk remarked in June 2003 that &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; had sold above 1 million copies, before the release of its first expansion pack. In the United States alone, the game sold 510,000 copies and earned $23.2 million by August 2006. At that time, &quot;Edge&quot; declared it the country&#x27;s 26th-best-selling computer game released since January 2000. It also received a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association, which indicates sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. Combined global sales of &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; and its expansion packs surpassed 2.6 million units by early 2005; by August 2006, the games totaled 1.3 million sales in the United States alone. Discounting its expansions, the original &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; ultimately sold 2.2 million copies, as of 2007.

===Critical reviews===
In general, &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; was met with positive reviews, receiving &quot;universal acclaim&quot; according to Metacritic. GameSpot referred to it as &quot;one of those exceedingly rare games that has a lot to offer virtually everyone, even if they aren&#x27;t already into RPGs&quot;, and praised it for its campaign, its Aurora toolset, and its graphics. The publication later named it the best computer game of June 2002. &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; called it &quot;a total package—a PC gaming classic for the ages&quot;, and said that its &quot;storyline [is] as persuasive as any I’ve encountered in a fantasy roleplaying game&quot;. Chris Chan of &quot;New Straits Times&quot; said, &quot;&quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; is every role-playing gamer&#x27;s dream&quot;. Allgame found that the game&#x27;s story was &quot;humdrum&quot; and &quot;mediocre&quot;. Mark Meadows of &quot;The Wisconsin State Journal&quot; agreed, saying the game was too focused on technical details. Victor Godinez of &quot;Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service&quot; did not care for the turn-based combat system, preferring to have direct control. He also said the controls were difficult to use occasionally.

&quot;GamePro&quot; noted the game&#x27;s graphics as being &quot;gorgeous&quot; and its sound as &quot;untouchable&quot;, and GameZone likewise praised its visuals, specifically mentioning its combat animation and spell effects as being well done. GameSpy was not as impressed by the graphics, saying &quot;The biggest, and arguably the only, glaring flaw in the game, is its graphics. You can tell that this game has been in development for five years[...]&quot;; however, they praised its voice acting and music. Godinez agreed, and also liked the game&#x27;s audio, noting in particular the scraps of conversation that can be heard in the background throughout the city.

Allgame praised &quot;Neverwinter Night&quot;″s DM tools, calling the game&#x27;s level creation options &quot;impressive&quot; and the multiplayer options &quot;great&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; thought that &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; is the closest that any video game has come to accurately representing the full &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; rules, a statement further reinforced by Greg Kasavin of GameSpot, who said that &quot;Neverwinter Nights isn&#x27;t the first &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game for the computer to make use of the pen-and-paper game&#x27;s 3rd Edition rules, but it&#x27;s the first to implement them so well&quot;. GameZone said that the Aurora Toolset was one of the &quot;best features&quot; of the game. John Breeden II of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said including the tool set was &quot;smartest thing Bioware did&quot;. He went on to say that giving such tools to the players became more commonplace, but was a bold move at the time of the game&#x27;s release. Chan commented, &quot;you could use the Aurora tools to create a dream world&quot;.

Peter Suciu of &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine called &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; &quot;possibly the richest fantasy PC experience ever created.&quot; According to GameSpy, &quot;&quot;Neverwinter&quot;&#x27;s contribution to D&amp;D gaming is always a hot topic and a source of argument.&quot;

===Awards===
During the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; was awarded with &quot;Computer Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot; by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences (AIAS); it also received a nomination for &quot;Computer Game of the Year&quot;. The game also won role-playing game of the year awards from &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; and GameSpot. RPG Vault declared it &quot;Product of the Year&quot;, while &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; ranked it the year&#x27;s second-best computer game across all genres. The latter publication&#x27;s editors wrote that the &quot;single-player game is merely passable&quot;, but they highly praised &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;″ content-creation tools, and argued that the game is &quot;what computer role-playing games should have been all along&quot;.

The game won special awards for its technology from &quot;Computer Games&quot;, the Game Developers Choice Awards (GDCA) and RPG Vault, the latter two for its network programming and Aurora Neverwinter Toolset, respectively. The Aurora Neverwinter Toolset was also a nominee in the AIAS&#x27;s &quot;Computer Simulation Game of the Year&quot; category. RPG Vault&#x27;s staff hailed the tool as &quot;an unprecedented combination of power, flexibility and ease of use.&quot;

&quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; received further nominations in the AIAS&#x27;s special categories for &quot;Outstanding Innovation in Computer Gaming&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Game Design&quot;, and in RPG Vault&#x27;s categories for music and writing, but lost these to other titles. However, it did win RPG Vault&#x27;s &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Community Building&quot; prize.

&quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; was a runner-up for the &quot;Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot; awards of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, IGN, GameSpy and RPG Vault, all of which went to &quot;The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind&quot;. The editors of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; wrote that &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; &quot;gave gamers a fabulous toolset for creating their own adventures—too bad the single-player campaign prompted a staffwide shrugging of shoulders.&quot; It was also nominated as the overall best computer game of 2002 by GameSpot, &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; and the AIAS, and as the year&#x27;s best game on any platform by the GDCA. These prizes went variously to &quot;Warcraft III&quot;, &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot; and &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;.

==Legacy==
IGN ranked &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; No. 4 on their list of &quot;The Top 11 Dungeons &amp; Dragons Games of All Time&quot; in 2014. Ian Williams of &quot;Paste&quot; rated the game #4 on his list of &quot;The 10 Greatest Dungeons and Dragons Videogames&quot; in 2015. The game has inspired a number of fan-made films made using machinima techniques of synchronizing video footage from a game to pre-recorded dialogue and other audio, such as &quot;BloodSpell&quot;, and &quot;Neverending Nights&quot;.

Since the original release of &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;, several in-game portraits have been modified in patches due to their having been copied from outside sources. In another instance, the Canadian Red Cross complained to BioWare about the appearance of the Red Cross symbol on the in-game item &quot;Healer&#x27;s Kit&quot;, as part of a long-running attempt to discourage outside usage of the symbol. This resulted in the Red Cross symbol being removed from the Healer&#x27;s Kit through patches.

&quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, a role-playing video game based in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, was also released by BioWare using a modified version of the Aurora engine of &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;, called the Odyssey Engine. The sequel, &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords&quot;, also used it. Because of this, modders have been able to modify these games using some &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; modding tools. &quot;The Witcher&quot;, a role-playing video game by CD Projekt Red, is also based on the Aurora engine of &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;. BioWare used &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; and its toolset to develop prototypes and mock-ups of various areas and scenarios for &quot;Dragon Age: Origins&quot;.

===Expansion packs and modules===
&quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; received an expansion pack, &quot;Neverwinter Nights: Shadows of Undrentide&quot;, in June 2003. Its story line concerns a student sent out to recover some stolen magical objects. The story begins in the Silver Marches, moving toward the desert of Anauroch and the old Netherese city of Undrentide. A second expansion &quot;Neverwinter Nights: Hordes of the Underdark&quot; was released in December 2003. The story continued where &quot;Shadows of Undrentide&quot; ended, with a character of at least 15th level, and led into the vast subterranean world known as the Underdark. The first chapter of the story took place in the Undermountain dungeon beneath the city of Waterdeep. &quot;Neverwinter Nights: Kingmaker&quot; was released in November 2004, and features three premium modules: the award-winning &quot;Kingmaker&quot;, &quot;Shadowguard&quot;, and &quot;Witch&#x27;s Wake&quot;.

Atari and BioWare helped to promote and release free downloadable hakpaks, models, and tileset expansion packs, which greatly expanded the possibilities of mod-making. The &quot;Players Resource Consortium&quot; (&quot;PRC&quot;) was released in early December 2003, and is a group of hakpaks adding classes, races, skills, and spells to the game. The &quot;PRC&quot; has roughly three times the number of prestige classes the original game had. It also adds dozens of epic spells, and many normal spells that make better use of BioWare&#x27;s Aurora engine. Psionic powers have also been included. The &quot;Community Expansion Pack&quot; (&quot;CEP&quot;), originally released in March 2004 (last updated in January 2017), is based on the &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; community&#x27;s fan-made material. This freely downloadable expansion was compiled by members of the community. It combines a selection of previously released custom content into one group of hakpaks.

In late 2004, BioWare launched its online store and started selling what it called &quot;premium modules&quot; as part of its digital distribution program. This initiative was led by BioWare&#x27;s Live Team Lead Designer, Rob Bartel. These smaller-scale adventures introduced new storylines and gameplay, and include new music and art that BioWare integrated into later patches to the core game. According to BioWare, the revenue generated by sales of the premium modules would be used to support their fan community and provide ongoing updates and improvements to the game. The modules that are sold in the BioWare store require an active Internet connection to play, even when played in single player mode. The modules in the &quot;Kingmaker&quot; expansion were stripped of this requirement, but are only available for Windows systems. The modules included with &quot;Neverwinter Nights Diamond Edition&quot; do not require Internet access to play. In August 2009, BioWare discontinued its selling of premium modules due to a request made by Atari. On June 16, 2011, the &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; digital rights management (DRM) authentication server was temporarily taken down as a reaction by Electronic Arts to the &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; store being hacked and customer data stolen. Premium modules which were purchased via BioWare&#x27;s store could not be played during that time because they could not connect to the server to validate the purchase, though DRM-free modules were unaffected. The modules &quot;Kingmaker&quot;, &quot;Shadowguard&quot;, and &quot;Witch&#x27;s Wake&quot; were sold as part of the &quot;Diamond Edition&quot; package.

 include &quot;Neverwinter Nights: Kingmaker&quot;, BioWare&#x27;s flagship premium module, which later received the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences &quot;Computer Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot; award. In the module&#x27;s story, the hero must defeat the evil at the Keep of Cyan and win the throne. Others include &quot;Neverwinter Nights: ShadowGuard&quot;, created by community member Ben McJunkin; &quot;Neverwinter Nights: Witch&#x27;s Wake&quot;, a remastered version of a module by Rob Bartel; &quot;Neverwinter Nights: Pirates of the Sword Coast&quot;; &quot;Neverwinter Nights: Infinite Dungeons&quot;, a BioWare module taking place in the Undermountain area below Waterdeep; and &quot;Neverwinter Nights: Wyvern Crown of Cormyr&quot;, which features fully ridable horses, flowing cloaks, tabards and long coats, a new prestige class (the Purple Dragon Knight), and extensive new art, creatures, and tilesets.

Premium modules were eventually discontinued. Three premium modules were known to be in development before cancellation. Two of them ended up being free downloads, while the third, a planned sequel to &quot;Witch&#x27;s Wake&quot;, was never released. &quot;Hex Coda&quot; by Stefan Gagne, the first cancelled premium module, was released to Neverwinter Vault in May 2005. The story was a mix of fantasy and science fiction and involved the protagonist dealing with the machinations of a multinational corporation called Cathedral. A sequel was in development, but was cancelled. In August 2006, Ossian Studios Inc., headed up by Alan Miranda, a former producer at BioWare, released the second canceled premium module to the Vault: &quot;Darkness over Daggerford&quot;. The story takes place in and around Daggerford and has been compared favorably to &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 2&quot; in terms of its scope. Characters start at the 8th level. The module includes a cinematic intro (like the main campaign) and a world map. Darkness over Daggerford&#x27;s status as a quasi-official expansion pack was supported by the next release of the team, this time a fully official one: Mysteries of Westgate for Neverwinter Nights 2.

===Sequels===
A sequel to &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;, &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2&quot;, was developed by Obsidian Entertainment, a company with a long history with BioWare. According to BioWare, the change of developer was due to BioWare&#x27;s business with other titles, such as &quot;Mass Effect&quot; and &quot;Dragon Age: Origins&quot;. &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2&quot; shipped in November 2006.

On August 23, 2010, Atari announced Cryptic Studios would be developing &quot;Neverwinter&quot;, an online role-playing game based on the book series of the same name by R.A. Salvatore. It is based on Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s global property &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; rules and feature the titular city Neverwinter. It was scheduled for an early 2013 release, and was ultimately released on June 20, 2013.

===Educational usage===
&quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; has been used by colleges and universities for a variety of educational purposes. It has been used at West Nottinghamshire College in the United Kingdom as a means of delivering key skills and of showing IT designers how to understand the coding in the game. The Synthetic Worlds Initiative at Indiana University has used it as a basis for the creation of &quot;&quot;, where Shakespeare&#x27;s dramatic history of Richard III and The War of the Roses can be interactively explored. The game and the Aurora toolset were also used at Macquarie University in Australia. The University of Alberta has offered a video game design course which uses &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; and the Aurora Toolset as the platform for teaching and course projects. The University of Minnesota has used the game to teach journalism students how to gather facts and information for news events with a modified modern setting for the game that involves interviewing witnesses and doing library research; in a modified game, students would work in pairs putting together a story about a train accident that causes a toxic chemical spill. &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; has also been used as an interface for some Moodle activity types.

===Editions and re-releases===
Atari released subsequent editions of the game following its first release in 2002. These editions are:
*&quot;Neverwinter Nights: Gold&quot; (2003), which includes &quot;Shadows of Undrentide&quot;
*&quot;Neverwinter Nights: Platinum&quot; (2004) (in Europe: &quot;Neverwinter Nights: Deluxe Edition&quot;), which includes both &quot;Shadows of Undrentide&quot; and &quot;Hordes of the Underdark&quot;
*&quot;Neverwinter Nights: Diamond&quot; (2005) (in Europe: &quot;Neverwinter Nights Deluxe: Special Edition&quot;), which includes everything in the &quot;Platinum&quot; edition plus the &quot;Kingmaker&quot; expansion pack
**In 2010, the &quot;Diamond&quot; edition was licensed for online distribution to GOG.com.

Atari also re-released the game and both expansion packs in the following collections:
*&quot;Atari Collection: Rollenspiele&quot; (2005)
*&quot;Neverwinter Nights 2: Lawful Good Edition&quot; (2006)
*&quot;Neverwinter Nights 2: Chaotic Evil Edition&quot; (2006)

*&quot;Neverwinter Nights 3-Pack&quot; (2007)

Beamdog announced the upcoming release of &quot;Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition&quot; on November 20, 2017. This version includes fixes made by the community since the last release, graphic improvements, premium modules, and the return of a multiplayer server list that was lost when &quot;GameSpy&quot; shut down. A digital deluxe version includes the soundtrack and the rest of the premium modules. A pre-release version was made available to purchase on November 21.

&quot;Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition&quot; launched on Steam on March 27, 2018, and on Google Play for Android on December 4, 2018.

<text>Hilltop, outpost or lot 26, was an illegal outpost, consisting of a mobile home, founded by Netanel Ozeri outside Hebron in the West Bank. It lay approximately from the Kiryat Arba settlement, in the Beqa&#x27;a valley. At the time of its destruction. Despite court orders, he kept expanding his outpost, refused to bullet-proof the caravan, fence the area he claimed in, or accept protection from the IDF.
The settlement was dismantled on the night of 24 March 2003 by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) due to a court order that established that the land belonged to Palestinian families who lived in the area. Ozeri&#x27;s wife, Livnat, daughter of the Jewish terrorist leader Shaul Nir, stated on the occasion:&quot;I will overcome my personal pain. But what is so painful is the Hillul Hashem [desecration of the name of God] that was committed here. Seeing that the Arab houses are still standing, while Jews destroyed houses of Jews - this is an indescribable pain.&quot; The settlement was the first to be destroyed during Ariel Sharon&#x27;s second term of office.

==Netanel Ozeri==
The illegal outpost made headlines following the death of Netanel Ozeri on 17 January 2003. Ozeri, who had been dining with his wife, 5-year-old daughter, and two friends, was killed in the evening by a 15-year-old Palestinian boy who was accompanied by another 16-year-old boy who kept look-out. One of the gunmen was subsequently killed by other Israelis present, while the second gunman was tracked and killed later by the IDF. Ozeri belonged to the banned extremist Jewish religious and nationalist Kach movement.

Netanel (Nati) Ozeri, born in Jerusalem, was a student at the Yeshivat HaRaayon HaYehudi established by Rabbi Meir Kahane, and was a study partner of his son, Binyamin Ze&#x27;ev Kahane, who was killed in a terrorist attack in December 2000. Ozeri later went on to teach at the yeshiva in Jerusalem, as well as in Kiryat Arba.

Ozeri was a leader of the Hebron community in terms of both settlement and Torah study/teaching. He was a great admirer of the terrorist Baruch Goldstein, who had murdered 29 Muslims at prayer in the Ibrahimi Mosque/Cave of the Patriarchs. His close friend, Noam Federman, said Netanel was &quot;an interesting and unusual combination, the type of person who stood out as a leader. He was a man of Torah, and a man of action.&quot; Federman noted that Netanel not only established new illegal settlement outposts and interested youths in settling there, he also made sure to teach them Torah on a regular schedule.

Ozeri was denied a funeral for two days, as wrangling broke out over where to bury him. His wife wanted his body buried on the outpost site to establish a &quot;covenant of blood&quot; with the land. After a long burial procession involving several thousand settlers, lasting some 12 hours, in which his body was carried round Palestinian fields and vineyards by a large crowd that crushed the grapes and produce, shouted that Yitzhak Rabin was responsible for his death, during which Palestinian cars were set on fire, windows were smashed, and Palestinians beaten up. Netanal Ozeri was buried in the old Jewish cemetery in Hebron, after Dov Lior gave a ruling. The funeral eulogy was given by Shaul Nir, who called for revenge. During the procession, settlers went against Jewish custom by exposing his face. Several settlers were indicted for rioting and attacking Israeli policemen some days later. The incident appears in Dan Setton&#x27;s documentary &quot;Israel&#x27;s Next War&quot;.

<text>A lithium polymer battery, or more correctly, lithium-ion polymer battery (abbreviated as LiPo, LIP, Li-poly, lithium-poly, and others), is a rechargeable battery of lithium-ion technology using a polymer electrolyte instead of a liquid electrolyte. Highly conductive semisolid (gel) polymers form this electrolyte. These batteries provide higher specific energy than other lithium battery types. They are used in applications where weight is critical, such as mobile devices, radio-controlled aircraft, and some electric vehicles.

They are widely used in laptop computers, tablets, and smartphones.

==History==

Lithium polymer cells follow the history of lithium-ion and lithium-metal cells, which underwent extensive research during the 1980s, reaching a significant milestone with Sony&#x27;s first commercial cylindrical lithium-ion cell in 1991. After that, other packaging forms evolved, including the flat pouch format.

==Design origin and terminology==

Lithium polymer cells have evolved from lithium-ion and lithium-metal batteries. The primary difference is that instead of using a liquid lithium-salt electrolyte (such as lithium hexafluorophosphate, LiPF6) held in an organic solvent (such as EC/DMC/DEC), the battery uses a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) or poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVdF).

In the 1970s, the original polymer design used a solid dry polymer electrolyte resembling a plastic-like film, replacing the traditional porous separator soaked with electrolyte.

The solid electrolyte can typically be classified into three types: dry SPE, gelled SPE, and porous SPE. The dry SPE was the first used in prototype batteries, around 1978 by Michel Armand, and 1985 by ANVAR and Elf Aquitaine of France, and Hydro-Québec of Canada. Since 1990, several organisations, such as Mead and Valence in the United States and GS Yuasa in Japan, have developed batteries using gelled SPEs. In 1996, Bellcore in the United States announced a rechargeable lithium polymer cell using porous SPE.

A typical cell has four main components: a positive electrode, a negative electrode, a separator, and an electrolyte. The separator itself may be a polymer, such as a microporous film of polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP); thus, even when the cell has a liquid electrolyte, it will still contain a &quot;polymer&quot; component. In addition to this, the positive electrode can be further divided into three parts: the lithium-transition-metal-oxide (such as LiCoO2 or LiMn2O4), a conductive additive, and a polymer binder of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVdF). The negative electrode material may have the same three parts, only with carbon replacing the lithium-metal-oxide. The main difference between lithium-ion polymer cells and lithium-ion cells is the physical phase of the electrolyte, such that LiPo cells use dry solid, gel-like electrolytes, whereas Li-ion cells use liquid electrolytes.

==Working principle==

Like other lithium-ion cells, LiPos work on the intercalation and de-intercalation of lithium ions from a positive electrode material and a negative electrode material, with the liquid electrolyte providing a conductive medium. To prevent the electrodes from touching each other directly, a microporous separator is in between, which allows only the ions and not the electrode particles to migrate from one side to the other.

==Voltage and state of charge==

The voltage of a single LiPo cell depends on its chemistry and varies from about 4.2 V (fully charged) to about 2.7–3.0 V (fully discharged). The nominal voltage is 3.6 or 3.7 volts (about the middle value of the highest and lowest value) for cells based on lithium-metal-oxides (such as LiCoO2). This compares to 3.6–3.8 V (charged) to 1.8–2.0 V (discharged) for those based on lithium-iron-phosphate (LiFePO4).

The exact voltage ratings should be specified in product data sheets, with the understanding that the cells should be protected by an electronic circuit that won&#x27;t allow them to overcharge or over-discharge under use.

LiPo battery packs, with cells connected in series and parallel, have separate pin-outs for every cell. A specialized charger may monitor the charge per cell so that all cells are brought to the same state of charge (SOC).

==Applying pressure on lithium polymer cells==

Unlike lithium-ion cylindrical and prismatic cells, with a rigid metal case, LiPo cells have a flexible, foil-type (polymer laminate) case, so they are relatively unconstrained.
Moderate pressure on the stack of layers that compose the cell results in increased capacity retention, because the contact between the components is maximised and delamination and deformation is prevented, which is associated with increase of cell impedance and degradation.
==Applications==

LiPo cells provide manufacturers with compelling advantages. They can easily produce batteries of almost any desired shape. For example, the space and weight requirements of mobile devices and notebook computers can be met. They also have a low self-discharge rate of about 5% per month.

=== Drones, radio-controlled equipment, and aircraft ===

LiPo batteries are now almost ubiquitous when used to power commercial and hobby drones (unmanned aerial vehicles), radio-controlled aircraft, radio-controlled cars, and large-scale model trains, where the advantages of lower weight and increased capacity and power delivery justify the price. Test reports warn of the risk of fire when the batteries are not used per the instructions.

The voltage for long-time storage of LiPo battery used in the R/C model should be 3.6~3.9 V range per cell, otherwise it may cause damage to the battery.

LiPo packs also see widespread use in airsoft, where their higher discharge currents and better energy density than traditional NiMH batteries have very noticeable performance gain (higher rate of fire).

===Personal electronics===
LiPo batteries are pervasive in mobile devices, power banks, very thin laptop computers, portable media players, wireless controllers for video game consoles, wireless PC peripherals, electronic cigarettes, and other applications where small form factors are sought. The high energy density outweighs cost considerations.

===Electric vehicles===

Hyundai Motor Company uses this type of battery in some of its battery-electric and hybrid vehicles and Kia Motors in its battery-electric Kia Soul. The Bolloré Bluecar, which is used in car-sharing schemes in several cities, also uses this type of battery.

===Uninterruptible power supply systems===
Lithium-ion batteries are becoming increasingly commonplace in Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems. They offer numerous benefits over the traditional VRLA battery, and with stability and safety improvements confidence in the technology is growing. Their power-to-size and weight ratio is seen as a major benefit in many industries requiring critical power backup, including data centers where space is often at a premium. The longer cycle life, usable energy (Depth of discharge), and thermal runaway are also seen as a benefit of using Li-po batteries over VRLA batteries.

===Jump starter===
The battery used to start a vehicle engine is typically 12 V or 24 V, so a portable jump starter or battery booster uses three or six LiPo batteries in series (3S1P/6S1P) to start the vehicle in an emergency instead of the other jump-start methods.
The price of a lead-acid jump starter is less but they are bigger and heavier than comparable lithium batteries. So such products have mostly switched to LiPo batteries or sometimes lithium iron phosphate batteries.

==Safety==


All Li-ion cells expand at high levels of state of charge (SOC) or overcharge due to slight vaporisation of the electrolyte. This may result in delamination and, thus, bad contact with the internal layers of the cell, which in turn diminishes the reliability and overall cycle life. This is very noticeable for LiPos, which can visibly inflate due to the lack of a hard case to contain their expansion. Lithium polymer batteries&#x27; safety characteristics differ from those of lithium iron phosphate batteries.

== Polymer electrolytes ==
Polymer electrolytes can be divided into two large categories: dry solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) and gel polymer electrolytes (GPE). In comparison to liquid electrolytes and solid organic electrolytes, polymer electrolytes offer advantages such as increased resistance to variations in the volume of the electrodes throughout the charge and discharge processes, improved safety features, excellent flexibility, and processability.

Solid polymer electrolyte was initially defined as a polymer matrix swollen with lithium salts, now called dry solid polymer electrolyte. Lithium salts are dissolved in the polymer matrix to provide ionic conductivity. Due to its physical phase, there is poor ion transfer, resulting in poor conductivity at room temperature. To improve the ionic conductivity at room temperature, gelled electrolyte is added resulting in the formation of GPEs. GPEs are formed by incorporating an organic liquid electrolyte in the polymer matrix. Liquid electrolyte is entrapped by a small amount of polymer network, hence the properties of GPE is characterized by properties between those of liquid and solid electrolytes. The conduction mechanism is similar for liquid electrolytes and polymer gels, but GPEs have higher thermal stability and a low volatile nature which also further contribute to safety.

==Lithium cells with solid polymer electrolyte==

Cells with solid polymer electrolytes have not been fully commercialised and are still a topic of research. Prototype cells of this type could be considered to be between a traditional lithium-ion battery (with liquid electrolyte) and a completely plastic, solid-state lithium-ion battery.

The simplest approach is to use a polymer matrix, such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF) or poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN), gelled with conventional salts and solvents, such as LiPF6 in EC/DMC/DEC.

Nishi mentions that Sony started research on lithium-ion cells with gelled polymer electrolytes (GPE) in 1988, before the commercialisation of the liquid-electrolyte lithium-ion cell in 1991. At that time, polymer batteries were promising, and it seemed polymer electrolytes would become indispensable. Eventually, this type of cell went into the market in 1998.
However, Scrosati argues that, in the strictest sense, gelled membranes cannot be classified as &quot;true&quot; polymer electrolytes but rather as hybrid systems where the liquid phases are contained within the polymer matrix. Although these polymer electrolytes may be dry to the touch, they can still include 30% to 50% liquid solvent. In this regard, how to define a &quot;polymer battery&quot; remains an open question.

Other terms used in the literature for this system include hybrid polymer electrolyte (HPE), where &quot;hybrid&quot; denotes the combination of the polymer matrix, the liquid solvent, and the salt. It was a system like this that Bellcore used to develop an early lithium-polymer cell in 1996, which was called a &quot;plastic&quot; lithium-ion cell (PLiON) and subsequently commercialised in 1999.

A solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) is a solvent-free salt solution in a polymer medium. It may be, for example, a compound of lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) and high molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), a high molecular weight poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC), polypropylene oxide (PPO), poly[bis(methoxy-ethoxy-ethoxy)phosphazene] (MEEP), &quot;etc&quot;.

PEO exhibits the most promising performance as a solid solvent for lithium salts, mainly due to its flexible ethylene oxide segments and other oxygen atoms that comprise a strong donor character, readily solvating Li+ cations. PEO is also commercially available at a very reasonable cost.

The performance of these proposed electrolytes is usually measured in a half-cell configuration against an electrode of metallic lithium, making the system a &quot;lithium-metal&quot; cell. Still, it has also been tested with a common lithium-ion cathode material such as lithium-iron-phosphate (LiFePO4).

Other attempts to design a polymer electrolyte cell include the use of inorganic ionic liquids such as 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIM]BF4) as a plasticizer in a microporous polymer matrix like poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PVDF-HFP/PMMA).

<doc id="201718" wikidata="Q1417473" url="?curid=201718" title="Principle of maximum entropy">
<text>The principle of maximum entropy states that the probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge about a system is the one with largest entropy, in the context of precisely stated prior data (such as a proposition that expresses testable information).

Another way of stating this: Take precisely stated prior data or testable information about a probability distribution function. Consider the set of all trial probability distributions that would encode the prior data. According to this principle, the distribution with maximal information entropy is the best choice.

==History==
The principle was first expounded by E. T. Jaynes in two papers in 1957, where he emphasized a natural correspondence between statistical mechanics and information theory. In particular, Jaynes argued that the Gibbsian method of statistical mechanics is sound by also arguing that the entropy of statistical mechanics and the information entropy of information theory are the same concept. Consequently, statistical mechanics should be considered a particular application of a general tool of logical inference and information theory.

==Overview==
In most practical cases, the stated prior data or testable information is given by a set of conserved quantities (average values of some moment functions), associated with the probability distribution in question. This is the way the maximum entropy principle is most often used in statistical thermodynamics. Another possibility is to prescribe some symmetries of the probability distribution. The equivalence between conserved quantities and corresponding symmetry groups implies a similar equivalence for these two ways of specifying the testable information in the maximum entropy method.

The maximum entropy principle is also needed to guarantee the uniqueness and consistency of probability assignments obtained by different methods, statistical mechanics and logical inference in particular.

The maximum entropy principle makes explicit our freedom in using different forms of prior data. As a special case, a uniform prior probability density (Laplace&#x27;s principle of indifference, sometimes called the principle of insufficient reason), may be adopted. Thus, the maximum entropy principle is not merely an alternative way to view the usual methods of inference of classical statistics, but represents a significant conceptual generalization of those methods.

However these statements do not imply that thermodynamical systems need not be shown to be ergodic to justify treatment as a statistical ensemble.

In ordinary language, the principle of maximum entropy can be said to express a claim of epistemic modesty, or of maximum ignorance. The selected distribution is the one that makes the least claim to being informed beyond the stated prior data, that is to say the one that admits the most ignorance beyond the stated prior data.

==Testable information==
The principle of maximum entropy is useful explicitly only when applied to &quot;testable information&quot;. Testable information is a statement about a probability distribution whose truth or falsity is well-defined. For example, the statements

:the expectation of the variable formula_1 is 2.87
and
:formula_2

(where formula_3 and formula_4 are probabilities of events) are statements of testable information.

Given testable information, the maximum entropy procedure consists of seeking the probability distribution which maximizes information entropy, subject to the constraints of the information. This constrained optimization problem is typically solved using the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Entropy maximization with no testable information respects the universal &quot;constraint&quot; that the sum of the probabilities is one. Under this constraint, the maximum entropy discrete probability distribution is the uniform distribution,

:formula_5

==Applications==
The principle of maximum entropy is commonly applied in two ways to inferential problems:

===Prior probabilities===
The principle of maximum entropy is often used to obtain prior probability distributions for Bayesian inference. Jaynes was a strong advocate of this approach, claiming the maximum entropy distribution represented the least informative distribution.
A large amount of literature is now dedicated to the elicitation of maximum entropy priors and links with channel coding.

===Posterior probabilities===
Maximum entropy is a sufficient updating rule for radical probabilism. Richard Jeffrey&#x27;s probability kinematics is a special case of maximum entropy inference. However, maximum entropy is not a generalisation of all such sufficient updating rules.

===Maximum entropy models===
Alternatively, the principle is often invoked for model specification: in this case the observed data itself is assumed to be the testable information. Such models are widely used in natural language processing. An example of such a model is logistic regression, which corresponds to the maximum entropy classifier for independent observations.

===Probability density estimation ===
One of the main applications of the maximum entropy principle is in discrete and continuous density estimation.
Similar to support vector machine estimators, 
the maximum entropy principle may require the solution to a quadratic programming problem, and thus provide 
a sparse mixture model as the optimal density estimator. One important advantage of the method is its ability to incorporate prior information in the density estimation.

==General solution for the maximum entropy distribution with linear constraints==
===Discrete case===
We have some testable information &quot;I&quot; about a quantity &quot;x&quot; taking values in {&quot;x1&quot;, &quot;x2&quot;..., &quot;xn&quot;}. We assume this information has the form of &quot;m&quot; constraints on the expectations of the functions &quot;fk&quot;; that is, we require our probability distribution to satisfy the moment inequality/equality constraints:

:formula_6

where the formula_7 are observables. We also require the probability density to sum to one, which may be viewed as a primitive constraint on the identity function and an observable equal to 1 giving the constraint

:formula_8

The probability distribution with maximum information entropy subject to these inequality/equality constraints is of the form:

:formula_9

for some formula_10. It is sometimes called the Gibbs distribution. The normalization constant is determined by:

:formula_11

and is conventionally called the partition function. (The Pitman–Koopman theorem states that the necessary and sufficient condition for a sampling distribution to admit sufficient statistics of bounded dimension is that it have the general form of a maximum entropy distribution.)

The λk parameters are Lagrange multipliers. In the case of equality constraints their values are determined from the solution of the nonlinear equations

:formula_12

In the case of inequality constraints, the Lagrange multipliers are determined from the solution of a convex optimization program with linear constraints. 
In both cases, there is no closed form solution, and the computation of the Lagrange multipliers usually requires numerical methods.

===Continuous case===
For continuous distributions, the Shannon entropy cannot be used, as it is only defined for discrete probability spaces. Instead Edwin Jaynes (1963, 1968, 2003) gave the following formula, which is closely related to the relative entropy (see also differential entropy).

:formula_13

where &quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), which Jaynes called the &quot;invariant measure&quot;, is proportional to the limiting density of discrete points. For now, we shall assume that &quot;q&quot; is known; we will discuss it further after the solution equations are given.

A closely related quantity, the relative entropy, is usually defined as the Kullback–Leibler divergence of &quot;p&quot; from &quot;q&quot; (although it is sometimes, confusingly, defined as the negative of this). The inference principle of minimizing this, due to Kullback, is known as the Principle of Minimum Discrimination Information.

We have some testable information &quot;I&quot; about a quantity &quot;x&quot; which takes values in some interval of the real numbers (all integrals below are over this interval). We assume this information has the form of &quot;m&quot; constraints on the expectations of the functions &quot;fk&quot;, i.e. we require our probability density function to satisfy the inequality (or purely equality) moment constraints:

:formula_14

where the formula_7 are observables. We also require the probability density to integrate to one, which may be viewed as a primitive constraint on the identity function and an observable equal to 1 giving the constraint

:formula_16

The probability density function with maximum &quot;Hc&quot; subject to these constraints is:

:formula_17

with the partition function determined by

:formula_18

As in the discrete case, in the case where all moment constraints are equalities, the values of the formula_19 parameters are determined by the system of nonlinear equations:

:formula_20

In the case with inequality moment constraints the Lagrange multipliers are determined from the solution of a convex optimization program.

The invariant measure function &quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) can be best understood by supposing that &quot;x&quot; is known to take values only in the bounded interval (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), and that no other information is given. Then the maximum entropy probability density function is

:formula_21

where &quot;A&quot; is a normalization constant. The invariant measure function is actually the prior density function encoding &#x27;lack of relevant information&#x27;. It cannot be determined by the principle of maximum entropy, and must be determined by some other logical method, such as the principle of transformation groups or marginalization theory.

===Examples===
For several examples of maximum entropy distributions, see the article on maximum entropy probability distributions.

==Justifications for the principle of maximum entropy==
Proponents of the principle of maximum entropy justify its use in assigning probabilities in several ways, including the following two arguments. These arguments take the use of Bayesian probability as given, and are thus subject to the same postulates.

===Information entropy as a measure of &#x27;uninformativeness&#x27;===
Consider a discrete probability distribution among formula_22 mutually exclusive propositions. The most informative distribution would occur when one of the propositions was known to be true. In that case, the information entropy would be equal to zero. The least informative distribution would occur when there is no reason to favor any one of the propositions over the others. In that case, the only reasonable probability distribution would be uniform, and then the information entropy would be equal to its maximum possible value, formula_23. The information entropy can therefore be seen as a numerical measure which describes how uninformative a particular probability distribution is, ranging from zero (completely informative) to formula_23 (completely uninformative).

By choosing to use the distribution with the maximum entropy allowed by our information, the argument goes, we are choosing the most uninformative distribution possible. To choose a distribution with lower entropy would be to assume information we do not possess. Thus the maximum entropy distribution is the only reasonable distribution. The dependence of the solution on the dominating measure represented by formula_25 is however a source of criticisms of the approach since this dominating measure is in fact arbitrary.

===The Wallis derivation===
The following argument is the result of a suggestion made by Graham Wallis to E. T. Jaynes in 1962. It is essentially the same mathematical argument used for the Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics in statistical mechanics, although the conceptual emphasis is quite different. It has the advantage of being strictly combinatorial in nature, making no reference to information entropy as a measure of &#x27;uncertainty&#x27;, &#x27;uninformativeness&#x27;, or any other imprecisely defined concept. The information entropy function is not assumed &quot;a priori&quot;, but rather is found in the course of the argument; and the argument leads naturally to the procedure of maximizing the information entropy, rather than treating it in some other way.

Suppose an individual wishes to make a probability assignment among formula_22 mutually exclusive propositions. He has some testable information, but is not sure how to go about including this information in his probability assessment. He therefore conceives of the following random experiment. He will distribute formula_27 quanta of probability (each worth formula_28) at random among the formula_22 possibilities. (One might imagine that he will throw formula_27 balls into formula_22 buckets while blindfolded. In order to be as fair as possible, each throw is to be independent of any other, and every bucket is to be the same size.) Once the experiment is done, he will check if the probability assignment thus obtained is consistent with his information. (For this step to be successful, the information must be a constraint given by an open set in the space of probability measures). If it is inconsistent, he will reject it and try again. If it is consistent, his assessment will be

:formula_32

where formula_33 is the probability of the formula_34th proposition, while &quot;ni&quot; is the number of quanta that were assigned to the formula_34th proposition (i.e. the number of balls that ended up in bucket formula_36).

Now, in order to reduce the &#x27;graininess&#x27; of the probability assignment, it will be necessary to use quite a large number of quanta of probability. Rather than actually carry out, and possibly have to repeat, the rather long random experiment, the protagonist decides to simply calculate and use the most probable result. The probability of any particular result is the multinomial distribution,

:formula_37

where

:formula_38

is sometimes known as the multiplicity of the outcome.

The most probable result is the one which maximizes the multiplicity formula_39. Rather than maximizing formula_39 directly, the protagonist could equivalently maximize any monotonic increasing function of formula_39. He decides to maximize

:formula_42

At this point, in order to simplify the expression, the protagonist takes the limit as formula_43, i.e. as the probability levels go from grainy discrete values to smooth continuous values. Using Stirling&#x27;s approximation, he finds

:formula_44

All that remains for the protagonist to do is to maximize entropy under the constraints of his testable information. He has found that the maximum entropy distribution is the most probable of all &quot;fair&quot; random distributions, in the limit as the probability levels go from discrete to continuous.

===Compatibility with Bayes&#x27; theorem===
Giffin and Caticha (2007) state that Bayes&#x27; theorem and the principle of maximum entropy are completely compatible and can be seen as special cases of the &quot;method of maximum relative entropy&quot;. They state that this method reproduces every aspect of orthodox Bayesian inference methods. In addition this new method opens the door to tackling problems that could not be addressed by either the maximal entropy principle or orthodox Bayesian methods individually. Moreover, recent contributions (Lazar 2003, and Schennach 2005) show that frequentist relative-entropy-based inference approaches (such as empirical likelihood and exponentially tilted empirical likelihood – see e.g. Owen 2001 and Kitamura 2006) can be combined with prior information to perform Bayesian posterior analysis.

Jaynes stated Bayes&#x27; theorem was a way to calculate a probability, while maximum entropy was a way to assign a prior probability distribution.

It is however, possible in concept to solve for a posterior distribution directly from a stated prior distribution using the principle of minimum cross-entropy (or the Principle of Maximum Entropy being a special case of using a uniform distribution as the given prior), independently of any Bayesian considerations by treating the problem formally as a constrained optimisation problem, the Entropy functional being the objective function. For the case of given average values as testable information (averaged over the sought after probability distribution), the sought after distribution is formally the Gibbs (or Boltzmann) distribution the parameters of which must be solved for in order to achieve minimum cross entropy and satisfy the given testable information.

==Relevance to physics==

The principle of maximum entropy bears a relation to a key assumption of kinetic theory of gases known as molecular chaos or &quot;Stosszahlansatz&quot;. This asserts that the distribution function characterizing particles entering a collision can be factorized. Though this statement can be understood as a strictly physical hypothesis, it can also be interpreted as a heuristic hypothesis regarding the most probable configuration of particles before colliding.

<text>HDMS &quot;Sælen&quot; (S323) (or KDM &quot;Sælen&quot;) is one of the three &quot;Tumleren&quot;-class small coastal submarines of the Royal Danish Navy.

==History==
She was built as a Type 207 submarine by Rheinstahl-Nordseewerke of Emden, Germany in 1965 for the Royal Norwegian Navy and served for 25 years as HNoMS &quot;Uthaug&quot; before being purchased by Denmark in 1990, and renamed after the seal. Her international call sign is OUCJ.

On 4 December 1990, &quot;Sælen&quot; sank in the Kattegat off Hesselø while being towed from Copenhagen to Aarhus. On 17 December, she was raised by the German floating crane &quot;Roland&quot; and taken to Aarhus for repair. On 10 August 1993, diving approval was issued and the boat was recommissioned.

&quot;Sælen&quot; served in the 2003 invasion of Iraq from May 2002 until June 2003. To speed her return to her homeport of Frederikshavn after 385 days of deployment in the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf, she was transported on board the heavy-lift ship &quot;Grietje&quot;.

==Museum ship==

After her return from the Persian Gulf, &quot;Sælen&quot; was decommissioned and handed over to the Royal Danish Naval Museum. &quot;Sælen&quot; is now on the hard at the old navy headquarters at Holmen in central Copenhagen where she is open to visitors.

==Historical background==

===German Protestantism===

====The Holy Roman Empire and the German Empire====
After the Peace of Augsburg in 1555, the principle that the religion of the ruler dictated the religion of the ruled (&quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot;) was observed throughout the Holy Roman Empire. Section 24 of the Peace of Augsburg (&quot;ius emigrandi&quot;) guaranteed members of denominations other than the ruler&#x27;s the freedom of emigration with all their possessions. Political stalemates among the government members of different denominations within a number of the republican free imperial cities such as Augsburg, the Free City of Frankfurt, and Regensburg, made their territories de facto bi-denominational, but the two denominations did not usually have equal legal status.

The Peace of Augsburg protected Catholicism and Lutheranism, but not Calvinism. Thus, in 1613, when John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg converted from Lutheranism to Calvinism, he could not exercise the principle of Cuius regio, eius religio&#x27; (&quot;whose realm, their religion&quot;). This situation paved the way for bi- or multi-denominational monarchies, wherein a ruler adhering to a creed different from most of his subjects would permit conversions to his minority denomination and immigration of his fellow faithful. In 1648, the Peace of Westphalia extended the principle of &quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot; to Calvinism.

However, the principle grew impracticable in the 17th and 18th centuries, which experienced continuous territorial changes arising from annexations and inheritances, and the religious conversion of rulers. For instance, Saxon Augustus II the Strong converted from Lutheranism to Catholicism in 1697, but did not exercise his &quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot; privilege. A conqueror or successor to the throne who adhered to a different creed from his new subjects usually would not complicate his takeover by imposing conversions. These enlarged realms spawned diaspora congregations, as immigrants settled in areas where the prevailing creeds differed from their own. This juxtaposition of beliefs in turn brought about more frequent personal changes in denomination, often in the form of marital conversions.

Still, regional mobility was low, especially in the countryside, which generally did not attract newcomers, but experienced rural exodus, so that today&#x27;s denominational make-up in Germany and Switzerland still represents the former boundaries among territories ruled by Calvinist, Catholic, or Lutheran rulers in the 16th century quite well. In a major departure, the legislature of the North German Confederation instituted the right of irreligionism in 1869, permitting the declaration of secession from all religious bodies.

The Protestant Church in Germany was and is divided into geographic regions and along denominational affiliations (Calvinist, Lutheran, and United churches). In the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, the then-existing monarchies and republics established regional churches (&quot;Landeskirchen&quot;), comprising the respective congregations within the then-existing state borders. In the case of Protestant ruling dynasties, each regional church affiliated with the regnal houses, and the crown provided financial and institutional support for its church. Church and State were, therefore, to a large extent combined on a regional basis.

====Weimar Germany====

In the aftermath of World War I with its political and social turmoil, the regional churches lost their secular rulers. With revolutionary fervor in the air, the conservative church leaders had to contend with socialists (Social Democrats (SPD) and Independent Social Democrats (USPD)), who mostly held to disestablishmentarianism. When Adolph Hoffmann, a strident secularist, was appointed Prussian Minister of Education and Public Worship in November 1918 by the USPD, he attempted to implement a number of plans, which included:
*cutting government subsidies for the church 
*confiscation of church property
*abolition of theology as a course of study in universities
*banning school prayer
*banning compulsory religious instruction in schools
*prohibiting schools from requiring attendance at worship services

After storms of protests from both Protestants and Catholics, Hoffmann was forced to resign and, by political means, the churches were able to prevent complete disestablishment. A compromise was reached — one which favored the Protestant church establishment. There would no longer be state churches, but the churches remained public corporations and retained their subsidies from the state governments for services they performed on behalf of the government (running hospitals, kindergartens etc.). In turn, on behalf of the churches, the state governments collected church fees from those taxpayers enlisted as parishioners and distributed these funds to the churches. These fees were, and still are, used to finance church activities and administration. The theological faculties in the universities continued to exist, as did religious instruction in the schools, however, allowing the parents to opt out for their children. The rights formerly held by the monarchs in the German Empire simply devolved to church councils instead, and the high-ranking church administrators — who had been civil servants in the Empire — simply became church officials instead. The governing structure of the churches effectively changed with the introduction of chairpersons elected by church synods instead of being appointed by the state.

Accordingly, in this initial period of the Weimar Republic, in 1922, the Protestant Church in Germany formed the German Evangelical Church Confederation of 28 regional (or provincial) churches (), with their regional boundaries more or less delineated by those of the federal states. This federal system allowed for a great deal of regional autonomy in the governance of German Protestantism, as it allowed for a national church parliament that served as a forum for discussion and that endeavored to resolve theological and organizational conflicts.

===The Nazi regime===
Many Protestants voted for the Nazis in the elections of summer and autumn 1932 and March 1933. This differed noticeably from Catholic populated areas, where the results of votes cast in favor of the Nazis were lower than the national average, even after the &quot;Machtergreifung&quot; (&quot;seizure of power&quot;) of Hitler.

A limited number of Protestants, such as Karl Barth, Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Wilhelm Busch, objected to the Nazis on moral and theological principles; they could not reconcile the Nazi state&#x27;s claim to total control over the person with the ultimate sovereignty that, in Christian orthodoxy, must belong only to God.

===German Christians===
The German Christian movement in the Protestant Church developed in the late Weimar period. They were, for the most part, a &quot;group of fanatic Nazi Protestants&quot; who were organized in 1931 to help win elections of presbyters and synodals of the old-Prussian church (last free election on 13 November 1932). In general, the group&#x27;s political and religious motivations developed in response to the social and political tensions wrought by the end of World War I and the attendant substitution of a republican regime for the authoritarian one of Wilhelm II — much the same as the conditions leading to Hitler&#x27;s rise to power.

The German Christian movement was sustained and encouraged by factors such as:
*the 400th anniversary (in 1917) of Martin Luther&#x27;s posting of the Ninety-five Theses in 1517, an event which served to endorse German nationalism, to emphasize that Germany had a preferred place in the Protestant tradition, and to legitimize antisemitism. This was reinforced by the Luther Renaissance Movement of Professor Emmanuel Hirsch. The extreme and shocking antisemitism of Martin Luther came to light rather late in his life, but had been a consistent theme in Christian Germany for centuries thereafter.
*the revival of &quot;völkisch&quot; traditions
*the de-emphasis of the Old Testament in Protestant theology, and the removal of parts deemed &quot;too Jewish&quot;, replacing the New Testament with a dejudaized version entitled &quot;Die Botschaft Gottes&quot; (The Message of God)
*the respect for temporal (secular) authority, which had been emphasized by Luther and has arguable scriptural support (Romans 13) 
&quot;For German Christians, race was the fundamental principle of human life, and they interpreted and effected that notion in religious terms. German Christianity emphasized the distinction between the visible and invisible church. For the German Christians, the church on earth was not the fellowship of the holy spirit described in the New Testament but a contrast to it, a vehicle for the expression of race and ethnicity&quot;. 

The German Christians were sympathetic to the Nazi regime&#x27;s goal of &quot;co-ordinating&quot; the individual Protestant churches into a single and uniform Reich church, consistent with the &quot;Volk&quot; ethos and the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot;.

===Creating a New National Church (&quot;Deutsche Evangelische Kirche&quot;)===
When the Nazis took power, the German Protestant church consisted of a federation of independent regional churches which included Lutheran, Reformed and United traditions.
In late April 1933 the leadership of the Protestant federation agreed to write a new constitution for a new &quot;national&quot; church, the German Evangelical Church ( or DEK). This had been one goal of many German Christians for some time, as centralization would enhance the coordination of Church and State, as a part of the overall Nazi process of Gleichschaltung (&quot;coordination&quot;, resulting in co-option). These German Christians agitated for Hitler&#x27;s advisor on religious affairs, Ludwig Müller, to be elected as the new Church&#x27;s bishop ().

Müller had poor political skills, little political support within the Church and no real qualifications for the job, other than his commitment to Nazism and a desire to exercise power. When the federation council met in May 1933 to approve the new constitution, it elected Friedrich von Bodelschwingh the Younger as &quot;Reichsbischof&quot; of the new Protestant Reich Church by a wide margin, largely on the advice and support of the leadership of the 28 church bodies.

Hitler was infuriated with the rejection of his candidate, and after a series of political maneuvers, Bodelschwingh resigned and Müller was elected as the new &quot;Reichsbischof&quot; on 27 September 1933, after the government had already imposed him on 28 June 1933. The formidable propaganda apparatus of the Nazi state was deployed to help the German Christians win presbyter and synodal elections in order to dominate the upcoming synod and finally put Müller into office. Hitler discretionarily decreed unconstitutional premature re-elections of all presbyters and synodals for 23 July; the night before the elections, Hitler made a personal appeal to Protestants by radio.

The German Christians won handily (70–80% of all seats in presbyteries and synods), except in four regional churches and one provincial body of the united old-Prussian church: the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria right of the river Rhine (&quot;right&quot; meaning &quot;east of&quot;), the Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover, Evangelical Reformed State Church of the Province of Hanover the Lutheran Evangelical State Church in Württemberg, and in the old-Prussian ecclesiastical province of Westphalia, where the German Christians gained no majorities. Among adherents of the Confessing Church these church bodies were termed &quot;intact churches&quot; (), as opposed to the German Christian-ruled bodies which they designated as &quot;destroyed churches&quot; (). This electoral victory enabled the German Christians to secure sufficient delegates to prevail at the so-called &quot;national synod&quot; that conducted the &quot;revised&quot; September election for &quot;Reichsbischof&quot;. Further pro-Nazi developments followed the elevation of Müller to the bishopric: in late summer the old-Prussian church (led by Müller since his government appointment on 6 July 1933) adopted the Aryan Paragraph, effectively defrocking clergy of Jewish descent and even clergy married to non-Aryans.

==The Confessing Church==

===Formation===

The Aryan Paragraph created a furor among some of the clergy. Under the leadership of Martin Niemöller, the Pastors&#x27; Emergency League (&quot;Pfarrernotbund&quot;) was formed, presumably for the purpose of assisting clergy of Jewish descent, but the League soon evolved into a locus of dissent against Nazi interference in church affairs. Its membership grew while the objections and rhetoric of the German Christians escalated.

The League pledged itself to contest the state&#x27;s attempts to infringe on the confessional freedom of the churches, that is to say, their ability to determine their own doctrine. It expressly opposed the adoption of the Aryan Paragraph which changed the meaning of baptism. It distinguished between Jews and Christians of Jewish descent and insisted, consistent with the demands of orthodox Christianity, that converted Jews and their descendants were as Christian as anyone else and were full members of the Church in every sense.

At this stage, the objections of Protestant leaders were primarily motivated by the desire for church autonomy and church/state demarcation rather than opposition to the persecution of non-Christian Jews, which was only just beginning. Eventually, the League evolved into the Confessing Church.

On 13 November 1933 a rally of German Christians was held at the Berlin Sportpalast, where — before a packed hall — banners proclaimed the unity of National Socialism and Christianity, interspersed with the omnipresent swastikas. One speaker, Reinhold Krause, was a school teacher and the Berlin district leader of the German Christians. He advocated the abandonment of the Old Testament with its tales of &quot;cattle traders and pimps&quot; in front of twenty thousand people. Resolutions were also proposed that would require all pastors to take a personal oath to Hitler, to require all churches to adopt and implement the Aryan Paragraph and to exclude converted Jews and their descendants from the church. Krause&#x27;s speech was so vulgar and objectionable that even Müller disavowed him and, for public relations purposes, suspended him from the group as a &quot;punishment&quot; to emphasize the disavowal. Some subjects discussed from the stage of the Sportspalast include:
*the removal of all pastors unsympathetic with National Socialism
*the expulsion of members of Jewish descent, who might be arrogated to a separate church
*the implementation of the Aryan Paragraph church-wide
*the removal of the Old Testament from the Bible
*the removal of &quot;non-German&quot; elements from religious services
*the adoption of a more &quot;heroic&quot; and &quot;positive&quot; interpretation of Jesus, who in pro-Aryan fashion should be portrayed to be battling mightily against corrupt Jewish influences.

This rather shocking attempt to rally the pro-Nazi elements among the German Christians backfired, as it now appeared to many Protestants that the State was attempting to intervene in the most central theological matters of the church, rather than only in matters of church organization and polity.

While Hitler, a consummate politician, was sensitive to the implications of such developments, Ludwig Müller was apparently not: he fired and transferred pastors adhering to the Emergency League, and in April 1934 actually deposed the heads of the Württembergian church (Bishop Theophil Wurm) and of the Bavarian church (Bishop Hans Meiser). They and the synodals of their church bodies continuously refused to declare the merger of their church bodies in the German Evangelical Church (DEK). The continuing aggressiveness of the DEK and Müller spurred the schismatic Protestant leaders to further action.

===Barmen Declaration of Faith===
In May 1934, the opposition met in a church synod in Barmen. The rebellious pastors denounced Müller and his leadership and declared that they and their congregations constituted the true Evangelical Church of Germany. The Barmen Declaration, primarily authored by Karl Barth, with the consultation and advice of other protesting pastors like Martin Niemöller and individual congregations, re-affirmed that the German Church was not an &quot;organ of the State&quot; and that the concept of State control over the Church was doctrinally false. The Declaration stipulated, at its core, that any State — even the totalitarian one — necessarily encountered a limit when confronted with God&#x27;s commandments. The Barmen declaration became in fact the foundation of the Confessing Church, confessing because it was based on a confession of faith.

After the Barmen Declaration, there were in effect two opposing movements in the German Protestant Church:

*the German Christian movement and
*the Confessing Church (the &quot;Bekennende Kirche&quot;, BK), often naming itself &quot;Deutsche Evangelische Kirche&quot; too, in order to reinforce its claim to be the true church

It should nevertheless be emphasized that the Confessing Church&#x27;s rebellion was directed at the regime&#x27;s ecclesiastical policy, and the German Christian movement, not at its overall political and social objectives.

===Post-Barmen===
The situation grew complex after Barmen. Müller&#x27;s ineptitude in political matters did not endear him to the Führer. Furthermore, the Sportpalast speech had proved a public relations disaster; the Nazis, who had promised &quot;freedom of religion&quot; in point 24 of their 25-point program, now appeared to be dictating religious doctrine.

Hitler sought to defuse the situation in the autumn of 1934 by lifting the house arrest of Meiser and Wurm, leaders of the Bavarian and Württembergian Lutheran churches, respectively. Having lost his patience with Müller in particular and the German Christians in general, he removed Müller&#x27;s authority, brought &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; to a temporary halt and created a new Reich Ministry – aptly named Church Affairs – under Hanns Kerrl, one of Hitler&#x27;s lawyer friends. The &quot;Kirchenkampf&quot; (&quot;church struggle&quot;) would now be continued on the basis of Church against State, rather than internally between two factions of a single church. Kerrl&#x27;s charge was to attempt another coordination, hopefully with more tact than the heavy-handed Müller.

Kerrl was more mild-mannered than the somewhat vulgar Müller, and was also politically astute; he shrewdly appointed a committee of conciliation, to be headed by Wilhelm Zoellner, a retired Westphalian general superintendent who was generally respected within the church and did not identify with any one faction. Müller himself resigned, more or less in disgrace, at the end of 1935, having failed to integrate the Protestant church and in fact having created somewhat of a rebellion. Martin Niemöller&#x27;s group generally cooperated with the new Zoellner committee, but still maintained that it represented the true Protestant Church in Germany and that the DEK was, to put it more bluntly than Niemöller would in public, no more than a collection of heretics.

The Confessing Church, under the leadership of Niemöller, addressed a polite, but firm, memorandum to Hitler in May 1936. The memorandum protested the regime&#x27;s anti-Christian tendencies, denounced the regime&#x27;s antisemitism and demanded that the regime terminate its interference with the internal affairs of the Protestant church.

This was essentially the proverbial straw that broke the back of the camel. The regime responded by:

* arresting several hundred dissenting pastors
* murdering Dr. Friedrich Weißler, office manager and legal advisor of the &quot;second preliminary church executive&quot; of the Confessing Church, in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp
* confiscating the funds of the Confessing Church
* forbidding the Confessing Church from taking up collections of offertories

Eventually, the Nazi tactics of repression were too much for Zoellner to bear and he resigned on 12 February 1937, after the Gestapo had denied him the right to visit some imprisoned pastors. The Minister of Church Affairs spoke to the churchmen the next day in a shocking presentation that clearly disclosed the regime&#x27;s hostility to the church:

===Resistance movement===
The Barmen Declaration itself did not mention the Nazi persecution of Jews or other totalitarian measures taken by the Nazis; it was a declaration of ecclesiastical independence, consistent with centuries of Protestant doctrine. It was not a statement of rebellion against the regime or its political and social doctrines and actions.

The Confessing Church engaged in only one form of unified resistance: resistance to state manipulation of religious affairs. While many leaders of the Confessing Church attempted to persuade the church to take a radical stance in opposition to Hitler, it never adopted this policy.

==Aftermath==
Some of the leaders of the Confessing Church, such as Martin Niemöller and Heinrich Grüber, were sent to Nazi concentration camps. While Grüber and Niemöller survived, not all did: Dietrich Bonhoeffer was sent initially to Tegel Prison, then to Buchenwald concentration camp, and finally to Flossenbürg concentration camp, where he was hanged. This left Christians who did not agree with the Nazis without leadership for much of the era.

A select few of the Confessing Church risked their lives to help Jews hiding illegally in Berlin during the war. A hat would be passed around at the end of secret meetings into which the congregation would donate identity cards and passbooks. These were then modified by forgers and given to underground Jews so they could pass as legal Berlin citizens. Several members of the Confessing Church were caught and tried for their part in creating forged papers, including Franz Kaufmann who was shot, and Helene Jacobs, who was jailed.

Many of those few Confessing Church members who actively attempted to subvert Hitler&#x27;s policies were extremely cautious and relatively ineffective. Some urged the need for more radical and risky resistance action. A Berlin Deaconess, , showed courage and offered &quot;perhaps the most impassioned, the bluntest, the most detailed and most damning of the protests against the silence of the Christian churches&quot; because she went the furthest in speaking on behalf of the Jews. Another Confessing Church member who was notable for speaking out against anti-Semitism was Hans Ehrenberg.

Meusel and two other leading women members of the Confessing Church in Berlin, Elisabeth Schmitz and , were members of the Berlin parish where Martin Niemöller served as pastor. Their efforts to prod the church to speak out for the Jews were unsuccessful.

Meusel and Bonhoeffer condemned the failure of the Confessing Church – which was organized specifically in resistance to governmental interference in religion – to move beyond its very limited concern for religious civil liberties and to focus instead on helping the suffering Jews. In 1935 Meusel protested the Confessing Church&#x27;s timid action:

Karl Barth also wrote in 1935: &quot;For the millions that suffer unjustly, the Confessing Church does not yet have a heart&quot;.

The Stuttgart Declaration of Guilt, was a declaration issued on 19 October 1945 by the Council of the Protestant Church in Germany (Evangelischen Kirche in Deutschland or EKD), in which it confessed guilt for its inadequacies in opposition to the Nazis. It was written mainly by former members of Confessing Church.

The Nazi policy of interference in Protestantism did not achieve its aims. A majority of German Protestants sided neither with &quot;Deutsche Christen&quot;, nor with the Confessing Church. Both groups also faced significant internal disagreements and division. The Nazis gave up trying to co-opt Christianity and instead expressed contempt toward it. When German Christians persisted, some members of the SS found it hard to believe that they were sincere and even thought they might be a threat.

<text>Bicycle touring is the taking of self-contained cycling trips for pleasure, adventure or autonomy rather than sport, commuting or exercise. Bicycle touring can range from single-day trips to extended travels spanning weeks or months. Tours may be planned by the participant or organized by a tourism business, local club or organization, or a charity as a fund-raising venture.

==Origins==
Historian James McGurn speaks of bets being taken in London in the 19th century for riders of hobby-horses – machines pushed by the feet rather than pedaled – outspeeding stagecoaches. &quot;One practitioner beat a four-horse coach to Brighton by half an hour,&quot; he says. &quot;There are various accounts of 15 to 17-year-olds &quot;draisienne&quot;-touring around France in the 1820s. On 17 February 1869 John Mayall, Charles Spencer and Rowley Turner rode from Trafalgar Square, London, to Brighton in 15 hours for 53 miles. &quot;The Times&quot;, which had sent a reporter to follow them in a coach and pair, reported an &quot;Extraordinary Velocipede Feat.&quot; Three riders set off from Liverpool to London, a journey of three days and similar to modern cycle-touring adventures, in March that same year. A newspaper report said:
Their bicycles caused no little astonishment on the way, and the remarks passed by the natives were almost amusing. At some of the villages the boys clustered round the machines, and, where they could, caught hold of them and ran behind until they were tired out. Many enquiries were made as to the name of &#x27;them queer horses&#x27;, some called them &#x27;whirligigs&#x27;, &#x27;menageries&#x27; and &#x27;valparaisons&#x27;. Between Wolverhampton and Birmingham, attempts were made to upset the riders by throwing stones.

Enthusiasm extended to other countries. &quot;The New York Times&quot; spoke of &quot;quantities of velocipedes flying like shuttles hither and thither&quot;. But while British interest had less frenzy than in the United States, it lasted longer.

The expansion from a machine that had to be pushed to propelled through pedals on a front wheel made longer distances feasible. A rider calling himself &quot;A Light Dragoon&quot; told in 1870 or 1871 of a ride from Lewes to Salisbury, across southern England. The title of his book, &quot;Wheels and Woes&quot;, suggests a less than event-free ride but McGurn says &quot;it seems to have been a delightful adventure, despite bad road surfaces, dust and lack of signposts. Husband and wife team Joseph Pennell (illustrator) and Elizabeth Robins Pennell (writer) published travelogues of their journeys framed as literary pilgrimages; they &quot;wheeled&quot; a tandem tricycle from Florence to Rome, attracting more attention than she was comfortable with, as possibly the first female rider that the Italians had ever seen.

Journeys grew more adventurous. Thomas Stevens, a writer for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, set off around the world on April 22 1884, on a 50-inch Columbia with a money belt, a revolver, two shirts and a rain cape, spending two years on the road and writing articles which became a two-volume, 1,021-page book. The feminist Annie Londonderry accomplished her around-the-globe bicycle trip as the first woman as early as in 1894–95. John Foster Fraser and two friends set off round the world on safety bicycles in July 1896. He, Edward Lunn and F. H. Lowe rode 19,237 miles, through 17 countries, in two years and two months. By 1878, recreational cycling was enough established in Britain to lead to formation of the Bicycle Touring Club, later renamed Cyclists&#x27; Touring Club. It is the oldest national tourism organisation in the world. Members, like those of other clubs, often rode in uniform. The CTC appointed an official tailor. The uniform was a dark green Devonshire serge jacket, knickerbockers and a &quot;Stanley helmet with a small peak&quot;. The colour changed to grey when green proved impractical because it showed the dirt. Groups often rode with a bugler at their head to sound changes of direction or to bring the group to a halt. Confusion could be caused when groups met and mistook each other&#x27;s signals.

Membership of the CTC inspired the Frenchman, Paul de Vivie (b. April 29, 1853), to found what became the Fédération Française de Cyclotourisme, the world&#x27;s largest cycling association, and to coin the French word &quot;cyclo-tourisme&quot;. The League of American Wheelmen in the U.S. was founded in Newport, Rhode Island, on May 30, 1880. It shared an interest in leisure cycling with the administration of cycle racing. Membership peaked at 103,000 in 1898. The primary national bicycle-touring organization in the U.S. is now Adventure Cycling Association. Adventure Cycling, then called Bikecentennial, organised a mass ride in 1976 from one side of the country to the other to mark the nation&#x27;s 200th anniversary. The Bikecentennial route is still in use as the TransAmerica Bicycle Trail.

==Social significance==
The first cyclists, often aristocratic or rich, flirted with the bicycle and then abandoned it for the new motor car. It was the lower middle class which profited from cycling and the liberation that it brought. &quot;The Cyclist&quot; of 13 August 1892 said: &quot;The two sections of the community which form the majority of &#x27;wheelmen&#x27; are the great clerk class and the great shop assistant class.&quot; H. G. Wells described this aspirant class liberated through cycling. Three of his heroes – in &quot;The History of Mr Polly&quot;, &quot;Kipps&quot; and &quot;The Wheels of Chance&quot; – buy bicycles. The first two work in drapery shops. The third, Hoopdriver, goes on a cycling holiday. The authors Roderick Watson and Martin Gray say:
Hoopdriver is certainly liberated by his machine. It affords him not only a country holiday, in itself a remarkable event which he enjoys immensely, however ignorant of the countryside he may be, but also a brush with a society girl, riding on pneumatics and wearing some kind of Rational Dress.

The book suggests the new social mobility created by the bike, which breaks the boundaries of Hoopdriver&#x27;s world literally and figuratively. Hoopdriver sets off in a spirit of freedom, finally away from his job:

Only those who toil six long days out of the seven, and all the year round, save for one brief glorious fortnight or ten days in the summer time, know the exquisite sensations of the First Holiday Morning. All the dreary, uninteresting routine drops from you suddenly, your chains fall about your feet...There were thrushes in the Richmond Road, and a lark on Putney Heath. The freshness of dew was in the air; dew or the relics of an overnight shower glittered on the leaves and grass...He wheeled his machine up Putney Hill, and his heart sang within him.

Wells puts Hoopdriver in a new brown cycling suit to show the importance of the venture and the freedom on which he is embarking. Hoopdriver finds the bicycle raises his social standing, at least in his imagination, and he calls to himself as he rides that he&#x27;s &quot;a bloomin&#x27; dook &quot; The New Woman that he pursues wears Rational Dress of a sort that scandalised society but made cycling much easier. The Rational Dress Society was founded in 1881 in London. It said:
Both Hoopdriver and the Young Lady in Grey, as he refers to her, are escaping social restraints through bicycle touring. Hoopdriver falls in love and rescues her from a lover who says marrying him is the only way that she, having left alone for a cycling holiday, can save her reputation. She lowers her social status; he raises his. McGurn says: &quot;The shift in social perspectives, as exemplified by Wells&#x27; cyclists, led Galsworthy to claim, at a later date, that the bicycle had &quot;been responsible for more movement in manners and morals than anything since Charles the Second.&quot;

==Development==
The bicycle gained from the outdoor movement of the 1930s. The Cyclists&#x27; Touring Club advertised a week&#x27;s all-in tour, staying at hotels recommended by cyclists, for £3 10s. The youth hostel movement started in Germany and spread abroad, and a cycling holiday staying at hostels in the 1930s could be had for £2. Roderick Watson and Martin Gray estimate there were ten million bicycles in Britain to one million cars.

A decline set in across Europe, particularly in Britain, when millions of servicemen returned from World War II having learned to drive. Trips away were now, for the increasing number who had one, by car. The decline in the United States came even sooner. McGurn says:
The story of interwar cycling was characterised by lack of interest and a steady decline... Cycling had lost out to the automobile, and to some extent to the new electric transport systems. In the 1930s cumbersome, fat-tyred &#x27;balloon bombers&#x27;, bulbously streamlined in imitation of motorcycles or aeroplanes, appealed to American children: the only mass market still open to cycle manufacturers. Wartime austerity gave cycling a short reprieve in the industrial world. The post-war peace was to lay the bicycle low.

However, between 1965 and 1975 the U.S. experienced a bike boom. In 1976, to celebrate the bicentennial of the founding of the United States, Greg Siple, his wife June, and Dan and Lys Burden organized a mass bike ride, Bikecentennial, from the Pacific to the Atlantic. Siple said:
My original thought was to send out ads and flyers saying, &#x27;Show up at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco at 9 o&#x27;clock on June 1 with your bicycle.&#x27; And then we were going to bicycle across the country. I pictured thousands of people, a sea of people with their bikes and packs all ready to go, and there would be old men and people with balloon-tire bikes and Frenchmen who flew over just for this. Nobody would shoot a gun off or anything. At 9 o&#x27;clock everybody would just start moving. It would be like this crowd of locusts crossing America.

The ride eventually ran from Astoria, Oregon, to Yorktown, Virginia, site of the first British settlements; 4,100 rode, with 2,000 completing the entire route. It defined a new start for cycle-touring in the United States and led to the creation of Adventure Cycling Association. Adventure Cycling has mapped routes across America and into Canada, many of the rides taking up to three months to complete on a loaded bicycle.

In Britain, the Cyclists Touring Club grew to 70,000 members by 2011 and is now the biggest body campaigning for cycling and cyclists&#x27; rights in the UK. It continues to organise group touring events including day rides through its local groups and CTC holidays in many countries led by experienced CTC members. Since 1983, Sustrans has created a National Cycle Network of long-distance cycle routes including back roads and traffic-free tracks built, signed, and mapped in partnership with local organisations.
Since 1980, there has been a growth of organised cycling holidays provided by commercial organisations in many countries. Some companies provide accommodation and route information to cyclists travelling independently; others focus on a group experience, including guides and support for a large number of riders cycling together. A variation on this is holidays, often in exotic locations, organised in partnership with a charity, in which participants are expected to raise donation as well as cover their costs. Due to the rise of hospitality exchange services from the nineties on, cycle travelers like other travelers got the means to better organize their stays at local hosts. The hospitality exchange website Warm Showers, which is specialized for cycle travelers started in 2005 and has over 100000 members worldwide today.
The scale of bicycle touring and its economic effects are difficult to estimate, given the activity&#x27;s informal nature. Market research indicates that in 2006 British cyclists spent £120m on 450,000 organised cycling holidays, and a further 2.5 million people included some cycling activity in their annual holiday that year. The total economic benefit to communities visited during the nine-day long Great Victorian Bike Ride was estimated at AU$2 million in 2011, which does not include costs paid directly to ride organisers and ongoing benefits to towns. Sustrans estimate that the total value of cycle tourism in the UK in 1997 was £635m and they forecast £14bn for the whole EU by 2020. Among examples of current activity given by Sustrans are 1.5m cyclists using the Danube Cycle Route each year and 25% of holiday visitors in Germany using bicycles during their visit.

==Voyages==
Bicycle touring can be of any distance and time. The French tourist Jacques Sirat speaks in lectures of how he felt proud riding round the world for five years – until he met an Australian who had been on the road for 27 years. The German rider, Walter Stolle, lost his home and living in the Sudetenland in the aftermath of World War II, settled in Britain and set off from Essex on 25 January 1959, to cycle round the world. He rode through 159 countries in 18 years, denied only those with sealed borders. He paid his way by giving slide shows in seven languages. He gave 2,500 such shows at US$100 each. In 1974, he rode through Nigeria, Dahomey, Upper Volta, Ghana, Leone, Ivory Coast, Liberia and Guinea. He was robbed 231 times, wore out six bicycles and had five more stolen. 

Heinz Stücke left his job as a die-maker in North Rhine-Westphalia in 1962 when he was 22 — three years after Stolle and is still riding. By 2006 he had cycled more than and visited 192 countries. He pays his way by selling photographs to magazines. From Asia, Gua Dahao left China in May 1999 to ride across Siberia, the Middle East, Turkey, western Europe, Scandinavia, then another 100,000 km across Africa, Latin America and Australia.

Others attempt long voyages in exceptionally short time periods. The current circumnavigation record by bicycle is 78 days 14 hours, and 40 minutes by Mark Beaumont

Noted writers have combined cycling with travel writing including Dervla Murphy, who made her first documented journey in 1963, from London to India, on a single speed bicycle with little more than a revolver and a change of underwear. In 2006, she described how, aged 74, she was held up at gunpoint and robbed while cycling in Russia. Eric Newby, Bettina Selby, and Anne Mustoe have all used cycling as a means to a literary end, valuing the way that cycling brings the traveller closer to people and places. Selby said,

:&quot;(the bicycle) makes me independent in a way no other form of transport can - it needs no fuel, no documents and very little maintenance. Most importantly it goes along at the right speed for seeing everything, and as it doesn&#x27;t cut me off from my surroundings, it also makes me a lot of friends.&quot;

In more recent years, British adventurers Alastair Humphreys (&quot;Moods of Future Joys&quot;), Mark Beaumont (&quot;The Man who Cycled the World&quot;), and Rob Lilwall (&quot;Cycling Home From Siberia&quot;) have all been on epic bicycle expeditions and written popular books about their exploits. But most bicycle tourists are ordinary people out of the spotlight.

One economic implication of bicycling is that it liberates the cyclist from oil consumption. The bicycle is an inexpensive, fast, healthy and environmentally friendly mode of transport. Ivan Illich said that bicycling extends the usable physical environment for people, while alternatives such as cars and motorways degrade and confined people&#x27;s environment and mobility.

The website crazyguyonabike.com includes thousands of rider-generated journals of cycling tours globally.

== Types ==
Distances vary considerably. Depending on fitness, speed and the number of stops, the rider usually covers between per day. A short tour over a few days may cover as little as and a long tour may go right across a country or around the world. There are many different types of bicycle touring:
;Lightweight touring
:Informally called &quot;credit-card touring&quot;, a rider carries a minimum of equipment and a lot of money. Overnight accommodation is in youth hostels, hotels, &quot;pensions&quot; or B&amp;Bs. Food is bought at cafes, restaurants or markets.
;Ultralight touring
:Differs from credit card touring in that the rider is self-sufficient but carries only the bare essentials and no frills.
;Fully loaded touring
:Also known as &quot;self-supported touring&quot;, cyclists carry everything they need, including food, cooking equipment, and a tent for camping. Some cyclists minimize their load, carrying only basic supplies, food, and a Bivouac shelter or lightweight tent.
;Expedition touring
:Cyclists travel extensively, often through developing nations or remote areas. The bicycle is loaded with food, spares, tools, and camping equipment so that the traveller is largely self-supporting. 
;Mixed Terrain Cycle-Touring / Bikepacking
:Also called rough riding, cyclists travel over a variety of surfaces and topography on a single route, with a single bicycle. Focusing on freedom of travel and efficiency over varied surfaces, cyclists often adopt an ultralight camping approach and carry their own minimal gear (bikepacking).
;Supported touring
:Cyclists are supported by a motor vehicle, which carries most equipment. This can be organized independently by groups of cyclists or commercial holiday companies. These companies sell places on guided tours, including booked lodging, luggage transfers, route planning and often meals and rental bikes.
;Day touring
:These rides vary highly in their size of the group, length, purpose, and methods of support. They may involve solo cyclists, group rides, or large organized rides with hundreds to thousands of riders. Their length can range from a few miles to century rides of or longer. Their purpose can range from riding for pleasure or fitness, to raising money for a charitable organization. Methods of support can include self-supported day rides, rides supported by friends or small groups, and organized rides where cyclists pay for support and accommodation provided by event organizers, including rest and refreshment stops, marshalling to aid safety, and sag services.
;S24O
:The Sub-24-hour Overnight, or S24O, is focused less on cycling and more on camping. Typically, one would depart on their bicycle in the late afternoon or evening, ride to a campsite in a few hours, make camp, sleep, and then ride home or even to work the next morning. This type can require very little planning or time commitment. If one lives in a large urban metropolis, this sort of trip might also be extended, taking a train or coach to get to a more convenient starting point, and may in fact take a lot longer than 24 hours, making it a weekend tour, otherwise still works on the same planning principles. As a term, &quot;S240&quot; was coined by Grant Petersen of Rivendell Bicycle Works.

== Touring bike ==


Cycle touring beyond the range of a day trip may need a bike capable of carrying heavy loads. Although many different bicycles can be used, specialist touring bikes are built to carry appropriate loads and to be ridden more comfortably over long distances. A typical bicycle would have a longer wheelbase for stability and heel clearance, frame fittings for front and rear pannier racks, additional water bottle mounts, frame fittings for front and rear mudguards/fenders, a broader range of gearing to cope with the increased weight, and touring tires which are wider to provide more comfort on backroads.

&quot;Ultralight tourers&quot; choose traditional road bicycles or &quot;Audax&quot; or randonneur bicycles for speed and simplicity. However, these bikes are harder to ride on unmade roads, which may limit route options. Since about 2015, gravel bikes are a new option to combine speed and unpaved road capabilities.

For some, the advantages of a recumbent bicycle are particularly relevant to touring.

To lessen the weight carried on the bicycle, or increase luggage capacity, touring cyclists may use bicycle trailers.

For a &quot;supported&quot; rider, luggage carrying is not important and a wider range of bicycle types may be suitable depending on the terrain.

== Navigation ==
There are many navigation apps and websites available for bicycle touring. Sometimes GPS routes lead to a dead trail, in this case most bicycle tourers simply backtrack and try another route.

<doc id="201749" wikidata="Q1017659" url="?curid=201749" title="Bus mastering">
<text>In computing, bus mastering is a feature supported by many bus architectures that enables a device connected to the bus to initiate direct memory access (DMA) transactions. It is also referred to as first-party DMA, in contrast with third-party DMA where a system DMA controller actually does the transfer.

Some types of buses allow only one device (typically the CPU, or its proxy) to initiate transactions. Most modern bus architectures, such as PCI, allow multiple devices to bus master because it significantly improves performance for general-purpose operating systems. Some real-time operating systems prohibit peripherals from becoming bus masters, because the scheduler can no longer arbitrate for the bus and hence cannot provide deterministic latency.

While bus mastering theoretically allows one peripheral device to directly communicate with another, in practice almost all peripherals master the bus exclusively to perform DMA to main memory.

If multiple devices are able to master the bus, there needs to be a bus arbitration scheme to prevent multiple devices attempting to drive the bus simultaneously. A number of different schemes are used for this; for example SCSI has a fixed priority for each SCSI ID. PCI does not specify the algorithm to use, leaving it up to the implementation to set priorities.

<text>The Vordingborg Castle ruins (&quot;Vordingborg Slotsruin&quot;) are located in the town of Vordingborg, Denmark and are the town&#x27;s most famous attraction.

==History==

The castle was built in 1175 by King Valdemar I of Denmark as a defensive fortress, and as a base from which to launch raids against the German coast. His half-brother built another castle in a remote location, which is now Copenhagen. King Valdemar II similarly used the castle for expansion into the Baltic, and in 1241, it was where he created the reformed legal system, the &quot;Code of Jutland&quot;. By the time of King Valdemar IV, the castle had nine towers and a defensive wall, 800 metres long.

Large parts of the castle were demolished after the Swedish wars had ended, in order to construct a palace for Prince George, son of King Frederick III. The prince never took up residence, and the palace too was demolished in the 18th century. Three manors were constructed nearby, including Iselingen, which became a meeting place for many leading artists and scientists during the 19th century.

==Current usage==

Today Vordingborg Castle is a ruin, although parts of the fourteenth century ring walls remain. The only fully preserved part of the castle, the 26 meter tall Goose Tower (&quot;Gåsetårnet&quot;), is the symbol of the city. The name comes from the golden goose that perches on top of the tower&#x27;s spire. Although legend has it that Valdemar Atterdag used the symbol to taunt the Hanseatic League, the truth is the goose was first erected in 1871. The tower was transferred into the national trust on December 24, 1808, and was thus the first, protected historic monument in Denmark.

Next to the castle is a botanical garden and also a museum. A larger museum is planned which will include information on all of Denmark&#x27;s historical castles. Excavations of the castle ruins continue. Regular archaeological digs take place here. Many of the finds are displayed in the exhibition at the Danish Castle Centre (&quot;Danmarks Borgcenter&quot;).

In 2004, the National Bank of Denmark issued a 20 DKK commemorative coin for the tower.

<doc id="201756" wikidata="Q713505" url="?curid=201756" title="Daniel Patrick Moynihan">
<text>Daniel Patrick Moynihan (; March 16, 1927 – March 26, 2003) was an American politician, diplomat and social scientist. A member of the Democratic Party, he represented New York in the United States Senate from 1977 until 2001 after serving as an adviser to President Richard Nixon, and as the United States&#x27; ambassador to India and to the United Nations.

Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Moynihan moved at a young age to New York City. Following a stint in the navy, he earned a Ph.D. in history from Tufts University. He worked on the staff of New York Governor W. Averell Harriman before joining President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s administration in 1961. He served as an Assistant Secretary of Labor under Presidents Kennedy and President Lyndon B. Johnson, devoting much of his time to the War on Poverty. In 1965, he published the controversial Moynihan Report on black poverty. Moynihan left the Johnson administration in 1965 and became a professor at Harvard University.

In 1969, he accepted Nixon&#x27;s offer to serve as an Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and he was elevated to the position of Counselor to the President later that year. He left the administration at the end of 1970, and accepted appointment as United States Ambassador to India in 1973. He accepted President Gerald Ford&#x27;s appointment to the position of United States Ambassador to the United Nations in 1975, holding that position until early 1976; later that year he won election to the Senate.

Moynihan served as Chairman of the Senate Environment Committee from 1992 to 1993 and as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee from 1993 to 1995. He also led the Moynihan Secrecy Commission, which studied the regulation of classified information. He emerged as a strong critic of President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s foreign policy and opposed President Bill Clinton&#x27;s health care plan. He frequently broke with liberal positions, but opposed welfare reform in the 1990s. He also voted against the Defense of Marriage Act, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the Congressional authorization for the Gulf War. He was tied with Jacob K. Javits as the longest-serving Senator from the state of New York until they were both surpassed by Chuck Schumer in 2023.

==Early life and education==
Moynihan was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the son of Margaret Ann (née Phipps), a homemaker, and John Henry Moynihan, a reporter for a daily newspaper in Tulsa but originally from Indiana. He moved at the age of six with his Irish Catholic family to New York City. Brought up in the working-class neighborhood of Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, he shined shoes and attended various public, private, and parochial schools, ultimately graduating from Benjamin Franklin High School in East Harlem. He was a parishioner of St. Raphael&#x27;s Church, where he also cast his first vote. He and his brother, Michael Willard Moynihan, spent most of their childhood summers at their grandfather&#x27;s farm in Bluffton, Indiana. Moynihan briefly worked as a longshoreman before entering the City College of New York (CCNY), which at that time provided free higher education to city residents.

He also had a half-brother, Thomas Joseph Stapelfeld, born on June 28, 1941, to their mother and Henry Charles Stapelfeld.

Following a year at CCNY, Moynihan joined the United States Navy in 1944. He was assigned to the V-12 Navy College Training Program at Middlebury College from 1944 to 1945 and then enrolled as a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps student at Tufts University, where he received an undergraduate degree in naval science in 1946. He completed active service as Gunnery officer of the USS &quot;Quirinus&quot; at the rank of lieutenant (junior grade) in 1947. Moynihan then returned to Tufts, where he completed a second undergraduate degree in sociology &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1948 and earned an MA from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in 1949.

After failing the Foreign Service Officer exam, he continued his doctoral studies at the Fletcher School as a Fulbright fellow at the London School of Economics from 1950 to 1953. During this period, Moynihan struggled with writer&#x27;s block and began to fashion himself as a &quot;dandy&quot;, cultivating &quot;a taste for Savile Row suits, rococo conversational riffs and Churchillian oratory&quot; even as he maintained that &quot;nothing and no one at LSE ever disposed me to be anything but a New York Democrat who had some friends who worked on the docks and drank beer after work.&quot; He also worked for two years as a civilian employee at RAF South Ruislip.

He ultimately received a PhD in history from Tufts (with a dissertation on the relationship between the United States and the International Labour Organization) from the Fletcher School in 1961 while serving as an assistant professor of political science and director of a government research project centered around Averell Harriman&#x27;s papers at Syracuse University&#x27;s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs.

==Political career and return to academia==
Moynihan&#x27;s political career started in the 1950s, when he served as a member of New York Governor Averell Harriman&#x27;s staff in a variety of positions (including speechwriter and acting secretary to the governor). He met his future wife, Elizabeth (Liz) Brennan, who also worked on Harriman&#x27;s staff.

This period ended following Harriman&#x27;s loss to Nelson Rockefeller in the 1958 general election. Moynihan returned to academia, serving as a lecturer for brief periods at Russell Sage College (1957–1958) and the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations (1959) before taking a tenure-track position at Syracuse University (1959–1961). During this period, Moynihan was a delegate to the 1960 Democratic National Convention as part of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s delegate pool.

===Kennedy and Johnson administrations===

Moynihan first served in the Kennedy administration as special (1961–1962) and executive (1962–1963) assistant to Labor Secretaries Arthur J. Goldberg and W. Willard Wirtz. In 1962, he authored the directive &quot;Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture&quot;, which discouraged use of an official style for federal buildings, and has been credited with enabling &quot;a wide ranging set of innovative public building projects&quot; in subsequent decades, including the San Francisco Federal Building and the United States Courthouse in Austin, Texas.

He was then appointed as Assistant Secretary of Labor for Policy, Planning and Research, serving from 1963 to 1965 under Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. In this capacity, he did not have operational responsibilities. He devoted his time to trying to formulate national policy for what would become the War on Poverty. His small staff included Ralph Nader.

They took inspiration from historian Stanley Elkins&#x27;s &quot;Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life&quot; (1959). Elkins essentially contended that slavery had made black Americans dependent on the dominant society, and that such dependence still existed a century later after the American Civil War. Moynihan and his staff believed that government must go beyond simply ensuring that members of minority groups have the same rights as the majority and must also &quot;act affirmatively&quot; in order to counter the problem of historic discrimination.

Moynihan&#x27;s research of Labor Department data demonstrated that even as fewer people were unemployed, more people were joining the welfare rolls. These recipients were families with children but only one parent (almost invariably the mother). The laws at that time permitted such families to receive welfare payments in certain parts of the United States.

==== Controversy over the War on Poverty ====
Moynihan issued his research in 1965 under the title &quot;The Negro Family: The Case For National Action&quot;, now commonly known as &quot;The Moynihan Report&quot;. Moynihan&#x27;s report fueled a debate over the proper course for government to take with regard to the economic underclass, especially blacks. Critics on the left attacked it as &quot;blaming the victim&quot;, a slogan coined by psychologist William Ryan. Some suggested that Moynihan was propagating the views of racists because much of the press coverage of the report focused on the discussion of children being born out of wedlock. Despite Moynihan&#x27;s warnings, the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program included rules for payments only if no &quot;Man [was] in the house.&quot; Critics of the program&#x27;s structure, including Moynihan, said that the nation was paying poor women to throw their husbands out of the house.

After the 1994 Republican sweep of Congress, Moynihan agreed that correction was needed for a welfare system that possibly encouraged women to raise their children without fathers: &quot;The Republicans are saying we have a hell of a problem, and we do.&quot;

===Local New York City politics and ongoing academic career===
By the 1964 presidential election, Moynihan was recognized as a political ally of Robert F. Kennedy. For this reason he was not favored by then-President Johnson, and he left the Johnson Administration in 1965. He ran for office in the Democratic Party primary for the presidency of the New York City Council, a position now known as the New York City Public Advocate. However, he was defeated by Queens District Attorney Frank D. O&#x27;Connor.

Throughout this transitional period, Moynihan maintained an academic affiliation as a fellow at Wesleyan University&#x27;s Center for Advanced Studies from 1964 to 1967. In 1966, he was appointed to the faculties of Harvard University&#x27;s Graduate School of Education and Graduate School of Public Administration as a full professor of education and urban politics. After commencing a second extended leave because of his public service in 1973, his faculty line was transferred to the university&#x27;s Department of Government, where he remained until 1977. From 1966 to 1969, he also held a secondary administrative appointment as director of the Harvard–MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies. With turmoil and riots in the United States, Moynihan, &quot;a national board member of ADA incensed at the radicalism of the current anti-war and Black Power movements&quot;, decided to &quot;call for a formal alliance between liberals and conservatives&quot;, and wrote that the next administration would have to be able to unite the nation again.

===Nixon administration===

Connecting with President-elect Richard Nixon in 1968, Moynihan joined the Executive Office of the President in January 1969 as Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and executive secretary of the Council of Urban Affairs (later the Urban Affairs Council), a forerunner of the Domestic Policy Council envisaged as an analog to the United States National Security Council. As one of the few people in Nixon&#x27;s inner circle who had done academic research related to social policies, he was very influential in the early months of the administration. However, his disdain for &quot;traditional budget-conscious positions&quot; (including his proposed Family Assistance Plan, a &quot;negative income tax or guaranteed minimum income&quot; for families that met work requirements or demonstrated that they were seeking work which ultimately stalled in the Senate despite prefiguring the later Supplemental Security Income program) led to frequent clashes (belying their unwavering mutual respect) with Nixon&#x27;s principal domestic policy advisor, conservative economist and Cabinet-rank Counselor to the President Arthur F. Burns.

While formulating the Family Assistance Plan proposal, Moynihan conducted significant discussions concerning a Basic Income Guarantee with Russell B. Long and Louis O. Kelso.

Although Moynihan was promoted to Counselor to the President for Urban Affairs with Cabinet rank shortly after Burns was nominated by Nixon to serve as Chair of the Federal Reserve in October 1969, it was concurrently announced that Moynihan would be returning to Harvard (a stipulation of his leave from the university) at the end of 1970. Operational oversight of the Urban Affairs Council was given to Moynihan&#x27;s nominal successor as Domestic Policy Assistant, former White House Counsel John Ehrlichman. This decision was instigated by White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman, a close friend of Ehrlichman since college and his main patron in the administration. Haldeman&#x27;s maneuvering situated Moynihan in a more peripheral context as the administration&#x27;s &quot;resident thinker&quot; on domestic affairs for the duration of his service.

In 1969, on Nixon&#x27;s initiative, NATO tried to establish a third civil column, establishing a hub of research and initiatives in the civil area, dealing as well with environmental topics. Moynihan named acid rain and the greenhouse effect as suitable international challenges to be dealt by NATO. NATO was chosen, since the organization had suitable expertise in the field, as well as experience with international research coordination. The German government was skeptical and saw the initiative as an attempt by the US to regain international terrain after the lost Vietnam War. The topics gained momentum in civil conferences and institutions.

In 1970, Moynihan wrote a memo to President Nixon saying, &quot;The time may have come when the issue of race could benefit from a period of &#x27;benign neglect&#x27;. The subject has been too much talked about. The forum has been too much taken over to hysterics, paranoids, and boodlers on all sides. We need a period in which Negro progress continues and racial rhetoric fades.&quot; Moynihan regretted that, as he saw it, critics misinterpreted his memo as advocating that the government should neglect minorities.

===U.S. Ambassador===
Following the October 1969 reorganization of the White House domestic policy staff, Moynihan was offered the position of United States Ambassador to the United Nations (then held by career Foreign Service Officer Charles Woodruff Yost) by Nixon on November 17, 1969; after initially accepting the president&#x27;s offer, he decided to remain in Washington when the Family Assistance Plan stalled in the Senate Finance Committee. On November 24, 1970, he refused a second offer from Nixon due to potential familial strain and ongoing financial problems; depression stemming from the repudiation of the Family Assistance Plan by liberal Democrats; and the inability to effect change due to static policy directives in the position, which he considered to be a tertiary role behind Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Henry Kissinger and United States Secretary of State William P. Rogers. Instead, he commuted from Harvard as a part-time member of the United States delegation during the ambassadorship of George H. W. Bush.

In 1973, Moynihan (who was circumspect toward the administration&#x27;s &quot;tilt&quot; to Pakistan) accepted Nixon&#x27;s offer to serve as United States Ambassador to India, where he would remain until 1975. The relationship between the two countries was at a low point following the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Ambassador Moynihan was alarmed that two great democracies were cast as antagonists, and set out to fix things. He proposed that part of the burdensome debt be written off, part used to pay for U.S. embassy expenses in India, and the remaining converted into Indian rupees to fund an Indo-US cultural and educational exchange program that lasted for a quarter century. On February 18, 1974, he presented to the Government of India a check for 16,640,000,000 rupees, then equivalent to $2,046,700,000, which was the greatest amount paid by a single check in the history of banking. The &quot;Rupee Deal&quot; is logged in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; for the world&#x27;s largest check, presented to India&#x27;s Secretary of Economic Affairs.

In June 1975, Moynihan accepted his third offer to serve as United States Ambassador to the United Nations, a position (including a rotation as President of the United Nations Security Council) that he would only hold until February 1976. Under President Gerald Ford, Ambassador Moynihan took a hardline anti-communist stance, in line with the agenda of the White House at the time. He was also a strong supporter of Israel, condemning UN Resolution 3379, which declared Zionism to be a form of racism. Moynihan&#x27;s wife Liz later recalled being approached in the UN galleries by Palestine Liberation Organization Permanent Observer Zuhdi Labib Terzi during the controversy. He made a remark of which she later did not remember the exact phrasing, but rendered it approximately as &#x27;you must have mixed feelings about remembering events in New Delhi&#x27;, which she and biographer Gil Troy interpreted as a threatening reference to a failed assassination plan against her husband two years earlier. But the American public responded enthusiastically to his moral outrage over the resolution; his condemnation of the &quot;Zionism is Racism&quot; resolution brought him celebrity status and helped him win a US Senate seat a year later. Moynihan opposed the resolution because he thought it was completely false and perverse. Also, his years in New York sensitized him on a pragmatic issue: &quot;resolution against Zionism not only affected Israel but every Zionist people, which included the majority of American Jews&quot;, which became clear when that community promoted a touristic boycott against Mexico as a consequence of its vote for the approval of the Resolution. In his book, &quot;Moynihan&#x27;s Moment&quot;, Gil Troy posits that Moynihan&#x27;s 1975 UN speech opposing the resolution was the key moment of his political career.

Perhaps the most controversial action of Moynihan&#x27;s career was his response, as Ambassador to the UN, to the Indonesian invasion of East Timor in 1975. Gerald Ford considered Indonesia, then under a military dictatorship, a key ally against Communism, which was influential in East Timor. Moynihan ensured that the UN Security Council took no action against the larger nation&#x27;s annexation of a small country. The Indonesian invasion caused the deaths of 100,000–200,000 Timorese through violence, illness, and hunger. In his memoir, Moynihan wrote:

Later, he said he had defended a &quot;shameless&quot; Cold War policy toward East Timor.

Moynihan&#x27;s thinking began to change during his tenure at the UN. In his 1993 book on nationalism, &quot;Pandaemonium&quot;, he wrote that as time progressed, he began to view the Soviet Union in less ideological terms. He regarded it less as an expansionist, imperialist Marxist state, and more as a weak realist state in decline. He believed it was most motivated by self-preservation. This view would influence his thinking in subsequent years, when he became an outspoken proponent of the then-unpopular view that the Soviet Union was a failed state headed for implosion.

Nevertheless, Moynihan&#x27;s tenure at the UN marked the beginnings of a more bellicose, neoconservative American foreign policy that turned away from Kissinger&#x27;s unabashedly covert, détente-driven realpolitik. Although it was never substantiated, Moynihan initially believed that Kissinger directed Ivor Richard, Baron Richard (then British Ambassador to the United Nations) to publicly denounce his actions as &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; diplomacy. Demoralized, Moynihan resigned from what he would subsequently characterize as an &quot;abbreviated posting&quot; in February 1976. In &quot;Pandaemonium&quot;, Moynihan expounded upon this decision, maintaining that he was &quot;something of an embarrassment to my own government, and fairly soon left before I was fired.&quot;

===United States Senator from New York (1977–2001)===
In November 1976, Moynihan was elected to the U.S. Senate from the State of New York, defeating U.S. Representative Bella Abzug, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, New York City Council President Paul O&#x27;Dwyer and businessman Abraham Hirschfeld in the Democratic primary, and Conservative Party incumbent James L. Buckley in the general election. He also was nominated by the Liberal Party of New York. Shortly after election, Moynihan analyzed the State of New York&#x27;s budget to determine whether it was paying out more in federal taxes than it received in spending. Finding that it was, he produced a yearly report known as the &quot;Fisc&quot; (from the French). Moynihan&#x27;s strong support for Israel while UN Ambassador inspired support for him among the state&#x27;s large Jewish population.

In an August 7, 1978 speech to the Senate, following the jailing of M. A. Farber, Moynihan stated the possibility of Congress having to become involved with securing press freedom and that the Senate should be aware of the issue&#x27;s seriousness.

Moynihan&#x27;s strong advocacy for New York&#x27;s interests in the Senate, buttressed by the &quot;Fisc&quot; reports and recalling his strong advocacy for US positions in the UN, did at least on one occasion allow his advocacy to escalate into a physical attack. Senator Kit Bond, nearing retirement in 2010, recalled with some embarrassment in a conversation on civility in political discourse that Moynihan had once &quot;slugged [Bond] on the Senate floor after Bond denounced an earmark Moynihan had slipped into a highway appropriations bill. Some months later Moynihan apologized, and the two occasionally would relax in Moynihan&#x27;s office after a long day to discuss their shared interest in urban renewal over a glass of port.&quot;

Moynihan continued to be interested in foreign policy as a Senator, sitting on the Select Committee on Intelligence. His strongly anti-Soviet views became far more moderate when he emerged as a critic of the Reagan administration&#x27;s hawkish tilt in the late Cold War, as exemplified by its support for the Contras in Nicaragua. Moynihan argued there was no active Soviet-backed conspiracy in Latin America, or anywhere. He suggested the Soviets were suffering from massive internal problems, such as rising ethnic nationalism and a collapsing economy. In a December 21, 1986 editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Moynihan predicted the replacement on the world stage of Communist expansion with ethnic conflicts. He criticized the administration&#x27;s &quot;consuming obsession with the expansion of Communism – which is not in fact going on.&quot; In a September 8, 1990 letter to Erwin Griswold, Moynihan wrote: &quot;I have one purpose left in life; or at least in the Senate. It is to try to sort out what would be involved in reconstituting the American government in the aftermath of the [C]old [W]ar. Huge changes took place, some of which we hardly notice.&quot; In 1981 he and fellow Irish-American politicians Senator Ted Kennedy and Speaker of the House Tip O&#x27;Neill co-founded the Friends of Ireland, a bipartisan organization of Senators and Representatives who opposed the ongoing sectarian violence and aimed to promote peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.

Moynihan introduced Section 1706 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which cost certain professionals (like computer programmers, engineers, draftspersons, and designers) who depended on intermediary agencies (consulting firms) a self-employed tax status option, but other professionals (like accountants and lawyers) continued to enjoy Section 530 exemptions from payroll taxes. This change in the tax code was expected to offset the tax revenue losses of other legislation that Moynihan proposed to change the law of foreign taxes of Americans working abroad. Joseph Stack, who flew his airplane into a building housing IRS offices on February 18, 2010, posted a suicide note that, among many factors, mentioned the Section 1706 change to the Internal Revenue Code.

As a key Environment and Public Works Committee member, Moynihan gave vital support and guidance to William K. Reilly, who served under President George H. W. Bush as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
In the mid-1990s, Moynihan was one of the Democrats to support the ban on the procedure known as partial-birth abortion. He said of the procedure: &quot;I think this is just too close to infanticide. A child has been born and it has exited the uterus. What on Earth is this procedure?&quot; Earlier in his career in the Senate, Moynihan had expressed his annoyance with the adamantly pro-choice interest groups petitioning him and others on the issue. He challenged them saying, &quot;you women are ruining the Democratic Party with your insistence on abortion.&quot;

Moynihan broke with orthodox liberal positions of his party on numerous occasions. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee in the 1990s, he strongly opposed President Bill Clinton&#x27;s proposal to expand health care coverage to all Americans. Seeking to focus the debate over health insurance on the financing of health care, Moynihan garnered controversy by stating that &quot;there is no health care crisis in this country.&quot;

On other issues though, he was much more progressive. He voted against the death penalty; the flag desecration amendment; the balanced budget amendment, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act; the Defense of Marriage Act; the Communications Decency Act; and the North American Free Trade Agreement. He was critical of proposals to replace the progressive income tax with a flat tax. Moynihan also voted against authorization of the Gulf War. Despite his earlier writings on the negative effects of the welfare state, he ended by voting against welfare reform in 1996, a bill that removed unemployment benefits. He was sharply critical of the bill and certain Democrats who crossed party lines to support it.

==Public speaker==
Moynihan was a popular public speaker with a distinctly patrician style. He spoke with a slight stutter, which led him to draw out vowels. Linguist Geoffrey Nunberg compared his speaking style to that of William F. Buckley, Jr.

==Commission on Government Secrecy==

In the post-Cold War era, the 103rd Congress enacted legislation directing an inquiry into the uses of government secrecy. Moynihan chaired the commission, which studied and made recommendations on the &quot;culture of secrecy&quot; that pervaded the United States government and its intelligence community for 80 years, beginning with the Espionage Act of 1917, and made recommendations on the statutory regulation of classified information.

The commission&#x27;s findings and recommendations were presented to the President in 1997. As part of the effort, Moynihan secured release from the Federal Bureau of Investigation of its classified Venona file. This file documents the FBI&#x27;s joint counterintelligence investigation, with the United States Signals Intelligence Service, into Soviet espionage within the United States. Much of the information had been collected and classified as secret information for over 50 years.

After release of the information, Moynihan authored &quot;Secrecy: The American Experience&quot; where he discussed the impact government secrecy has had on the domestic politics of America for the past half century, and how myths and suspicion created an unnecessary partisan chasm.

==Personal life==
Moynihan married Elizabeth Brennan in 1955. The couple had three children, Tim, Maura, and John, and were married until his death.

Moynihan was criticized after reportedly making offensive comments towards a woman of Jamaican descent at Vassar College in early 1990. During a question-and-answer session, Moynihan told Folami Grey, an official at the Dutchess County Youth Bureau, &quot;If you don&#x27;t like it in this country, why don&#x27;t you pack your bags and go back where you came from?&quot; This incident caused a protest in which 100 students took over the college&#x27;s main administration building in response to his comments.

==Death==

Moynihan died at Washington Hospital Center on March 26, 2003, from complications of a ruptured appendix, 10 days after his 76th birthday.

==Career as scholar==
As a public intellectual, Moynihan published articles on urban ethnic politics and on the problems of the poor in cities of the Northeast in numerous publications, including &quot;Commentary&quot; and &quot;The Public Interest&quot;.

Moynihan coined the term &quot;professionalization of reform&quot;, by which the government bureaucracy thinks up problems for government to solve rather than simply responding to problems identified elsewhere.

In 1983, he was awarded the Hubert H. Humphrey Award given by the American Political Science Association &quot;in recognition of notable public service by a political scientist.&quot; He wrote 19 books, leading his personal friend, columnist and former professor George F. Will, to remark that Moynihan &quot;wrote more books than most senators have read.&quot; After retiring from the Senate, he rejoined the faculty of the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, where he began his academic career in 1959.

Moynihan&#x27;s scholarly accomplishments led Michael Barone, writing in &quot;The Almanac of American Politics&quot; to describe the senator as &quot;the nation&#x27;s best thinker among politicians since Lincoln and its best politician among thinkers since Jefferson.&quot; Moynihan&#x27;s 1993 article, &quot;Defining Deviancy Down&quot;, was notably controversial. Writer and historian Kenneth Weisbrode describes Moynihan&#x27;s book &quot;Pandaemonium&quot; as uncommonly prescient.

* &quot;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any point in being Irish if you don&#x27;t know that the world is going to break your heart eventually. I guess that we thought we had a little more time.&quot;– Reacting to the assassination of John F. Kennedy, November 1963
* &quot;No one is innocent after the experience of governing. But not everyone is guilty.&quot;– &quot;The Politics of a Guaranteed Income&quot;, 1973
* &quot;Secrecy is for losers. For people who do not know how important the information really is.&quot;– &quot;Secrecy: The American Experience&quot;, 1998
:The quote also adds, &quot;The Soviet Union realized this too late. Openness is now a singular, and singularly American, advantage.&quot;
* &quot;The issue of race could benefit from a period of benign neglect.&quot;– Memo to President Richard Nixon
* &quot;Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.&quot;– Column on January 18, 1983 &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Based on an earlier quote by James R. Schlesinger.
* (In response to the question: &quot;Why should I work if I am going to just end up emptying slop jars?&quot;) &quot;That&#x27;s a complaint you hear mostly from people who don&#x27;t empty slop jars. This country has a lot of people who do exactly that for a living. And they do it well. It&#x27;s not pleasant work, but it&#x27;s a living. And it has to be done. Somebody has to go around and empty all those bed pans. And it&#x27;s perfectly honorable work. There&#x27;s nothing the matter with doing it. Indeed, there is a lot that is right about doing it, as any hospital patient will tell you.&quot;
* &quot;Food growing is the first thing you do when you come down out of the trees. The question is, how come the United States can grow food and you can&#x27;t?&quot;– speaking to Third World countries about global famine
* &quot;The central conservative truth is that it is culture, not politics, that determines the success of a society. The central liberal truth is that politics can change a culture and save it from itself.&quot;
* &quot;Truman left the Presidency thinking that Whittaker Chambers, Elizabeth Bentley were nuts, crackpots, scoundrels, and I think you could say that a fissure began in American political life that&#x27;s never really closed. It reverberates, and I can say more about it. But in the main, American liberalism—Arthur Schlesinger, one of the conspicuous examples—got it wrong. We were on the side of the people who denied this, and a president who could have changed his rhetoric, explained it, told the American people, didn&#x27;t know the facts, they were secret, and they were kept from him.&quot;– &quot;Secrecy: The American Experience&quot;, October 1998

<text>The Portland Streetcar is a streetcar system in Portland, Oregon, that opened in 2001 and serves areas surrounding downtown Portland. The NS Line runs from Northwest Portland to the South Waterfront via Downtown and the Pearl District. The Loop Service, which opened in September 2012 as the Central Loop (CL Line), runs from Downtown to the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry via the Pearl District, the Broadway Bridge across Willamette River, the Lloyd District, and the Central Eastside Industrial District and added of route. In September 2015 the line was renamed as the Loop Service, with the A Loop traveling clockwise, and the B Loop traveling counterclockwise. The two-route system serves some 20,000 daily riders.

As with the heavier-duty MAX Light Rail network which serves the broader Portland metropolitan area, Portland Streetcars are operated and maintained by TriMet. But unlike MAX, the streetcar system is owned by the city of Portland and managed by Portland Streetcar Incorporated, a non-profit public benefit corporation whose board of directors report to the city&#x27;s Bureau of Transportation.

Like some of Portland&#x27;s original streetcar lines, redevelopment has been a major goal of the project. The Portland Streetcar is the first new streetcar system in the United States since World War II.

== Routes ==

Since September 2012, the Portland Streetcar system has three services, which share a section along 10th and 11th Avenues in downtown, through the West End.

As of mid-2015, the two-line streetcar system measures , measured in one direction only – not round-trip lengths – and counting only once the section served by both routes. The end-to-end length of the original route, now designated the &quot;NS Line&quot;, is since 2007, and the 2012-opened &quot;CL Line&quot; added . The total one-way length of the CL Line is , for it shares of route along 10th and 11th Avenues in downtown with the NS Line.

Of the NS Line&#x27;s round-trip length, are one-way operation along streets which are mostly also one-way and with the streetcars following parallel streets in opposite directions. The remaining of round-trip route length are sections where the NS streetcar route uses a single street (or private right-of-way) for both directions of travel. The CL Line, similarly, follows separate streets in opposite directions over most of its length. The only exceptions are a length of about near the OMSI terminus (mostly on a streetcar-only viaduct over the Union Pacific Railroad main line) and the route sections nearest to, and across, the Broadway Bridge. With the opening of the second line, the system now has 76 stops.

The steepest grade on the system is 8.75% in the block of SW Harrison Street between 1st and 2nd avenues, which since 2015 has been on a section of track used by both routes.

==Service==
Streetcars are scheduled to arrive at 15-minute intervals at most times, with a 20-minute frequency in the evening and on Sundays. Every stop is fitted with an electronic reader board giving real-time arrival information to waiting passengers, using the NextBus vehicle tracking system. This was first brought into use on March 25, 2002.

As on TriMet&#x27;s MAX line, the streetcar&#x27;s fare system is a proof-of-payment (or &quot;honor&quot;) system, with random inspections of passengers&#x27; fares, which minimizes wait times at stops by allowing boarding to take place simultaneously through all vehicle doorways. Streetcar operators do not collect or monitor fares. Although the line is not part of the TriMet system, the city honors TriMet&#x27;s fares for the streetcar, for simplicity and convenience of transferring passengers. Streetcar-only fares are available, but are not valid on TriMet, unless using a Hop card, which will charge the difference in fare upon transferring.

The portion of the streetcar route within Downtown and the Pearl District of the streetcar route used to lie within TriMet&#x27;s Fareless Square, later known as the Free Rail Zone. Rides within that area were free at all times. TriMet ended the Free Rail Zone on September 1, 2012.

Passengers not already in possession of a valid fare when boarding are required to use their credit/debit card on the hop card readers on board each Streetcar. Portland Streetcar used to have ticket machines on board but have since been removed and replaced with machines outside the Streetcar. Each vehicle also carries a ticket validator machine, for stamping &quot;unvalidated&quot; TriMet tickets purchased in advance. TriMet and Portland Streetcar have agreed to honor one another&#x27;s fares, which means that TriMet passes, tickets and bus transfer receipts are accepted on the streetcar, and tickets purchased or validated on a streetcar are valid for travel on TriMet services (bus, MAX or WES Commuter Rail). To facilitate this, the ticket machines on board the streetcars and at streetcar stops sell TriMet tickets – covering both the streetcar fare and any TriMet rides the purchaser makes within the ticket&#x27;s period of validity (2.5 hours or all day) – as well as streetcar-only tickets. For the same reason, prior to September 2012, the streetcar ticket machines offered all-zone (three-zone) and two-zone tickets, despite the fact that the streetcar system was located entirely within TriMet&#x27;s Zone 1. TriMet tickets and transfers were valid all-day on the streetcar prior to that change, which also coincided with TriMet&#x27;s elimination of the Free Rail Zone (Fareless Square). Since September 1, 2012, TriMet and Portland Streetcar tickets have an identical period of validity, of 2.5 hours (except for all-day tickets).

NS Line streetcars enter service on westbound tracks (at NW Northrup and 16th streets). Service starts at NW 23rd Avenue at Marshall. Yard-bound trains make their last stop at NW 18th Street and Lovejoy before entering yard via Lovejoy.

Loop Service streetcars enter service on eastbound tracks (at NW Lovejoy and 15th streets). Service starts at NW 9th Street and Lovejoy. Yard-bound trains make their last stop at NW 14th Street and Northrup (which is a NS Line stop) before entering yard via Northrup.

Portland Streetcar launched a new program in 2022 called Rider Ambassadors they are groups of streetcar personnel who help people onboard, give directions and connect people to resources, and help keep the riders safe. They ride the trains throughout the day and can be recognized by their purple vests


==Rolling stock==
As of 2024, the system&#x27;s fleet included 19 cars.

===Current fleet===

The streetcars are a Czech design, and the first ten – which is all cars purchased before 2009 – were built in the Czech Republic and shipped to the United States complete. Streetcars added to the fleet after the first ten were built in the U.S. by United Streetcar, to basically the same design. All have a low-floor center section between the trucks, and at one door on each side they are equipped with a MAX-like bridge plate—a short ramp that extends from the vehicle doorway—to allow wheelchair access. Compared to MAX cars they are shorter and narrower, a result of having to run in mixed traffic on neighborhood streets, alongside parked automobiles. The cars are lighter than those used by MAX, allowing cheaper, less-intense track construction. Furthermore, couplers on the streetcars are hidden behind bumper skirts and only used to move disabled units back to the yard.

From spring 2007 until fall 2012, the serviceable fleet included ten streetcars. An 11th car was delivered in 2009 but did not enter service until September 2012 (see next section). The 11 cars were supplied in four batches between 2001 and 2009, built by any of three different manufacturers. However, they have nearly identical dimensions and are similar in all respects, since the design used for all eleven cars was developed by the same two Czech companies, Škoda and Inekon.

Cars 001 through 005 have been in operation since 2001, while cars 006 and 007 were added in 2002. These seven were built by a now-defunct joint venture between Škoda and Inekon, and are Škoda&#x27;s 10T model, originally also called &quot;Astra&quot; 10T. Inekon performed most of the design work, while Škoda carried out the construction, in Plzeň.

Three additional cars, numbered 008–010, were ordered for the expansion of service to South Waterfront. By that time, the partnership between Inekon and Škoda had dissolved in an &quot;ugly divorce&quot;, so these cars were constructed in Ostrava, Czech Republic, by a partnership of Inekon and the Ostrava city transit agency, Dopravní Podnik Ostrava. This partnership was originally named DPO-Inekon, but soon adopted the (English) name &quot;Inekon Trams&quot;. Portland cars 008–010 are model &quot;12-Trio&quot; (a particular version of Inekon&#x27;s &quot;Trio&quot; series of streetcar designs) and have a high degree of spare parts compatibility with the existing fleet. They arrived in Portland in January 2007, and after a period of street testing, entered service in late May 2007.

===U.S.-built streetcars===
The next delivery, on May 15, 2009, was effectively another Škoda 10T, but built in the United States under license, rather than by Škoda itself. It entered service in September 2012.

Under a 2005 federal transportation bill, $4 million was allocated for construction of a U.S.-manufactured streetcar vehicle. Congressman Peter DeFazio indicated that the contract would go to Oregon Iron Works in Clackamas, Oregon, and that Portland would be permitted to keep the prototype vehicle permanently.

This special federal grant was intended to foster the creation of a domestic manufacturing industry for modern streetcars, which was non-existent at the time. This lack had forced streetcar systems to turn to overseas builders as the only source of the type of railcar needed. The first Portland Streetcar project had not used any federal funds. However, for any future streetcar projects desiring to obtain federal matching funds, among which were the planned future expansion in Portland, the vehicles would need to comply with the minimum 60% U.S. content provisions of the &quot;Buy America&quot; Act ().
In February 2006, Škoda Transportation established an &quot;exclusive technology transfer agreement&quot; with Oregon Iron Works (OIW) to build streetcars meeting &quot;Buy America&quot; rules, and the two companies jointly prepared a detailed OIW submission when the city of Portland (owner of the Portland Streetcar system) issued a request for proposals in mid-2006 to build one new streetcar for the Portland Streetcar. In January 2007, OIW won a contract from Portland to build the prototype streetcar, to the Škoda design, and reported that it had established a new subsidiary, United Streetcar LLC, to perform the work.

The United Streetcar prototype, number 015 in the Portland Streetcar fleet, was delivered on May 15, 2009, but did not enter service until 2012. The car is model 10T, the same as Škoda-built cars 001–007, but features a slightly modified end design. Although the differences are relatively minor, car 015 is considered to be model variant 10T3, whereas cars 001-005 were 10T0 and cars 006-007 were 10T2. Car 015, which carries a red, white and blue paint scheme and large &quot;Made in USA&quot; lettering along the sides, was presented to the public in a July 1, 2009, ceremony, at which Secretary Ray LaHood was the featured speaker.

Car 015&#x27;s entry into service was delayed by more than three years, not finally occurring until September 2012. The main reason for the delay was a 2010 decision to replace its propulsion-control system – the electronic equipment which controls and coordinates the operation of the car&#x27;s motors and other key operating components – with equipment made by Rockwell Automation, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Although the car was complete and operable in mid-2009, it had yet to undertake the extensive &quot;acceptance testing&quot; needed to certify that it was safe for passenger service and would run reliably. Car 015&#x27;s propulsion control system was made by Škoda, whereas all 10 earlier Portland streetcars—even the seven cars built by Škoda—had control systems supplied by Elin EBG, an Austrian company (and only installed by Škoda). Acceptance testing began in late summer 2009, but revealed unspecified problems, and Škoda and Portland Streetcar were unable to reach agreement on resolving them. This issue, together with a desire by PS, United Streetcar and others to increase further the U.S. content of streetcars built by United Streetcar, led to discussions between Rockwell Automation and the various interested parties in Portland on the possibility and feasibility of Rockwell designing a control system for the United Streetcar design. In April 2010, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) approved a $2.4-million grant, to be matched by $600,000 in local money, to fund the replacement of car 015&#x27;s control equipment with new equipment to be designed by Rockwell Automation. Under FTA rules, the grant was made to TriMet (the region&#x27;s primary transit agency), but TriMet only acted as intermediary in this instance, and it passed the funds along to the Portland Streetcar system&#x27;s owner, the city of Portland, who administered the contract with Rockwell and the now-amended contract with Oregon Iron Works/United Streetcar. The change was expected to increase the overall U.S. content of the car from around 70% to around 90%, and this helped win the support of federal officials to approve the $2.4 million in &quot;research funds&quot; needed to allow project to proceed. Prototype streetcar 015 was transported back to the OIW factory, in Portland&#x27;s southeast suburbs, in May 2010, and it returned on April 30, 2012, now fitted with the experimental Rockwell propulsion system. It began acceptance testing on the Portland Streetcar tracks in June and was certified for service on September 21, 2012. It entered passenger service the following day, September 22, 2012, the opening day of the new eastside line (CL Line).
Meanwhile, the city also purchased an additional five streetcars for the eastside expansion. A contract for these was let to United Streetcar in August 2009 and was originally for six cars. However, in light of Portland&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the Škoda propulsion control system, the city decided in 2010 to modify the OIW/United Streetcar contract for these cars, to substitute equipment from Elin for the originally planned Škoda equipment. Fabrication of the streetcars had yet to begin at the time of that decision, but the change was substantial enough that delivery was delayed as a result, and the first cars are now not projected to be delivered until December 2012. These five cars were not fitted with the Rockwell equipment, because the Rockwell system was still being designed at the time that production was beginning on the additional cars. If the city had waited for it to be completed, installed and thoroughly tested in car 015 before installing it in the additional cars, doing so would delay the completion of those cars too much, city officials indicated. These first &quot;production-series&quot; cars are United Streetcar model &quot;100&quot;, instead of 10T3. In 2011, production problems raised the cost of manufacturing of these cars, and as a result, the city agreed to reduce the number of cars on order from six to five. These cars have been assigned numbers 021–025 in the Portland Streetcar fleet. The first car (021) was delivered in January 2013 and entered service on June 11, 2013. As Portland Streetcar prepared to &quot;close the loop&quot; on the CL line with the completion of the Tilikum Crossing bridge, a seventh car (026) was purchased from United Streetcar and was delivered on November 21, 2014.

On March 21, 2018, Portland Streetcar announced an approval from city council to purchase two new Liberty Streetcars from Brookville Equipment Corporation. A third car was added to the order in December 2018. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors, production of the cars was delayed, and by spring 2021 they were not expected to arrive until late 2022 or early 2023. An option for two additional vehicles also exists. The delivery of the Brookville order began in late March 2023, with the arrival of the first car in Portland; the third and last car arrived in December 2023.

Prototype car 015, uniquely fitted with the experimental Rockwell propulsion system, became unreliable within a few years of entering service in 2012, and by 2019 it had experienced a system failure that the city was unable to repair. The car was last used in service in 2019, and was placed up for auction in 2024.

===Vintage Trolley service===

Until late 2005 the fleet also contained two Portland Vintage Trolleys, replicas of 1904 J. G. Brill Company streetcars owned by TriMet. These two cars (of four such cars owned by TriMet) were transferred to the city of Portland in 2001 for use on the Portland Streetcar line on weekends. They were used on both Saturdays and Sundays, with just one car in service on each day. However, they were not wheelchair-accessible on the streetcar line, and they lacked the satellite-detection equipment necessary for them to be detected by the real-time arrival system (NextBus) informing passengers waiting at stops. When the line was extended to RiverPlace, the Vintage Trolley service continued to terminate at PSU, because of concerns that the steep incline on the new section could damage the cars&#x27; motors. These and other issues led to suspension of the Vintage Trolley service in late November 2005. It never resumed, and the two vintage-style cars were returned to TriMet and moved back to that agency&#x27;s Vintage Trolley carbarn next to the Rose Quarter MAX station in January 2007. (One other Vintage Trolley continued to provide service on a portion of the MAX system until 2014.)

===Compatibility with MAX ===
Each Portland streetcar is long, whereas Portland&#x27;s MAX cars are long, and streetcars are operated in revenue service as single cars at all times, never coupled into trains. However, all models of the fleet can couple with each other for a rescue tow. The shorter car length keeps station construction expense lower than would be the case for a light-rail station, but the smaller cars do not provide equal carrying capacity as that of a light-rail train; a single articulated Portland streetcar is only about one-third the length of a two-car MAX train.

Streetcar tracks in Portland are the same gauge as MAX tracks, but of a lighter and shallower construction (the rail bed is only deep), and the two systems share the same overhead line voltage, 750 V DC. Because of this, it is technically possible for a Portland 10T or 12-Trio streetcar to run on MAX tracks, and indeed originally this was planned to take place if a streetcar needed a particular type of maintenance work that was beyond the capabilities of Portland Streetcar&#x27;s own &quot;carbarn&quot;. The two systems are connected at two places: the first is a single curve of track at SW 10th and Morrison connecting to the westbound Red and Blue Line track. An additional set of connections exists at both ends of the Tilikum Crossing, as Central Loop streetcars share tracks with the MAX Orange Line to cross the bridge.

TriMet&#x27;s light-rail maintenance shops feature additional equipment, as TriMet&#x27;s railcar fleet is many times larger, so streetcars were operated along the MAX tracks to the light-rail workshops at Ruby Junction (near the Ruby Junction/East 197th Avenue station on the Blue Line) for maintenance work on their trucks a few times. However, because the streetcar has a limited top speed of about (compared with for MAX trains) and because of differences in the signalling systems, streetcar movements to the Ruby Junction facility had to take place very late at night, a time when TriMet schedules maintenance on the MAX line. Portland Streetcar managers therefore decided, early on, simply to remove streetcar components needing repair at a TriMet facility and transport them there by road, avoiding the need to schedule time on the MAX line to move a streetcar. Portland Streetcar now owns a truing machine, which has been installed in the left bay of the North Yard.

While streetcars can operate on the MAX light rail tracks, a MAX car would be too heavy to operate on the streetcar&#x27;s tracks, too wide for portions of its right-of-way, and unable to pass through the tighter curves on the Portland Streetcar system.

===Maintenance yard===
Streetcars are stored at the rail yard near the Portland Streetcar, Inc. headquarters (1516 NW Northrup Street). Storage tracks and facilities occupy three city blocks underneath an elevated section of Interstate 405, between NW Overton and NW Lovejoy streets (north-to-south) and NW 16th and NW 15th streets (west-to-east).

==History==

City of Portland planners began considering a streetcar system in 1990, in response to recommendations in a Central City Plan the council had adopted in 1988. The proposed network was originally referred to as the Central City Trolley and was envisioned as using faux-vintage streetcars like those of the Portland Vintage Trolley service. However, the name was later changed to Central City Streetcar, out of concern by project supporters that the word &quot;trolley&quot; would carry the connotation that the service was only a tourist attraction rather than a form of transportation, and in 1993 the city decided the line would use modern, low-floor cars instead of vintage ones. In 1995, the city estimated the cost to build a line from Northwest Portland to PSU as $30 million.

Portland Streetcar started with a counterclockwise loop of single track that commenced operations on July 20, 2001, running from the Portland State University (PSU) campus, north through the Pearl District, west to NW 23rd Avenue and then back to PSU on adjacent streets. Most of the $57 million used to build it came from local sources, and only $5 million came from the federal government.

On March 11, 2005, a extension was placed into service at the line&#x27;s southern end, from PSU to RiverPlace. This was the first phase of a plan to serve Portland&#x27;s South Waterfront redevelopment area, including a new outpost of Oregon Health &amp; Science University. This section includes a short length of two-way single-track operation, which at the time was about long and ran along Montgomery Street and 4th Avenue. (The 4th Avenue section was doubled in 2014.) Streetcar-only signals ensure that only one direction is in use at one time. The extension cost $18.1 million, including the purchase of two additional streetcars, with the intent to allow streetcars to run every 10 minutes. In 2005 the Portland Streetcar project was awarded the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence gold medal.
Another extension of south to the lower terminus of the Portland Aerial Tram at SW Gibbs Street, in the South Waterfront District, opened on October 20, 2006. For the next five years, that section of track differed from the rest of the line in that the streetcar track ran entirely in its own right-of-way (formerly used by the Willamette Shore Trolley). It was also bi-directional single track. This configuration was always planned to be temporary, awaiting an expected rebuilding of Moody Avenue, and in November 2011 the streetcar line began using new double track on a realigned section of Moody. This change left the short section of bi-directional single track around 4th and Montgomery as the only such running on the current PS system. At the streetcar&#x27;s Gibbs Street stop, a new pedestrian bridge opened in summer 2012, linking the stop to the Lair Hill neighborhood that was otherwise cut off by Interstate 5.

On August 17, 2007, the route was extended south of Gibbs Street, to SW Lowell and Bond, serving more of the South Waterfront district. This extension is a 10-block loop, from SW Moody and Gibbs proceeding south on Moody Avenue, east on Lowell Street and north on Bond Avenue to OHSU Commons at Gibbs, which stop is also directly adjacent to the entrance to the aerial tram.

By 2008, Portland estimated the streetcar prompted the construction of more than 10,000 new housing units and of institutional, office, and retail and construction within two blocks.

During 2010, Portland Streetcar had a weekday average of 11,900 riders. In August 2012, it was reported by one source as &quot;about 10,000&quot;, but ridership varies by season – for example, being higher when Portland State University is in session – and the daily-ridership figure averaged over a 12-month period through summer 2012, the last 12-month period before the second line opened, was 11,200.
On September 1, 2012, TriMet discontinued the Free Rail Zone (better known by its pre-2010 name, Fareless Square), which had previously allowed free service on the streetcar within Downtown and the Pearl District. A new streetcar-only fare of $1.00 was introduced at that time.

On September 22, 2012, the Eastside Line, renamed the Central Loop Line (or CL Line, for short), opened for service.

In 2014, about half of the system&#x27;s only section of bidirectional single track used in service, along SW 4th Avenue and Montgomery Street, was converted to double track, with the installation a second track along 4th and around the turn onto Montgomery. This new track came into use on September 23, 2014, and reduced the remaining length of two-way single track to less than (in operational terms; less than of actual shared track), on Montgomery Street between 4th and 5th Avenues.

On August 30, 2015, the Central Loop Line was renamed as the Loop Service, with the A Loop traveling in a clockwise direction and the B Loop traveling counter-clockwise.

==Funding==
Funding for the streetcar operation comes primarily from TriMet, fares, city parking revenue, and a &quot;Local Improvement District&quot; (special property tax assessed on properties near the line). Another source of funding for the streetcar is sponsorships of vehicles and stops, which in most cases have a minimum duration of one year,
in contrast to the shorter-term advertising found on TriMet buses and MAX. Sponsoring organizations can have their name placed on the side of the vehicle, stop shelter or in the stop announcement, as well as a small advertisement placed inside the vehicle or shelter. Brochures and ticket sales can also be sponsored.

For the eastside line, the federal government contributed $75 million in 2009, with $20 million coming from Oregon Lottery-backed bonds; the rest of the cost was paid by the city, through the Portland Development Commission and a local improvement district tax on property owners near the line.

==Eastside line==
Utility relocation work in connection with a expansion of the streetcar system to the city&#x27;s inner eastside began in mid-August 2009. The work of laying the streetcar tracks began in early 2010, with service scheduled to start on September 22, 2012, a delay from what was originally an April 2012 date. The project involved work on the Broadway Bridge that required the bridge&#x27;s weight to remain constant throughout construction and for work on its lift span to be suspended with 72 hours notice whenever a ship needed to get through.

In June 2003, the Office of Transportation adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study, a study for an extension of the streetcar to the Lloyd and Central Eastside Industrial Districts. In part, the desire for an eastside streetcar arose from the July 2001 report, Lloyd District Development Strategy. Proponents see it as a component of a potential transportation hub in the Lloyd District, bringing together the streetcar, MAX and bus service. Additionally, the new streetcar line will provide a transit connection between the Lloyd and Central Eastside districts that supporters believe is more attractive and permanent than the bus service (TriMet line 6) currently provided and is more likely to spur development in those areas. Existing businesses along the route have also voiced strong support for the project, believing it will bring new customers who otherwise would be more likely to shop in nearby downtown.

The plans were approved by the Metro (regional government) council in July 2006 and by the Portland city council in September 2007, the council committing to allocating $27 million of city funds. The estimated total cost of the project is $147 million, just over half of which is to be paid for with federal funds. On April 30, 2009, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced the approval of $75 million in federal funding for the Eastside streetcar project, the full amount that had been requested by Portland. This allocation, secured in large part through the efforts of Oregon Representatives Earl Blumenauer and Peter DeFazio, was both the largest and the final component of the financing plan, and consequently the announcement meant the project could proceed to construction as soon as the city council had approved construction contracts. Twenty million dollars in state funds, $15.5 million from a Local Improvement District and a combination of various other local or regional sources complete the funding plan. Construction began in August 2009.

The routing of the Eastside line was finalized in about 2007 and measures about in each direction (slightly longer southbound). It leaves the original line at 10th and Lovejoy, runs east across the Willamette River via the Broadway Bridge to the Lloyd District, turns south, passing the Oregon Convention Center, and follows the Grand Avenue and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard couplet to the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI), the initial terminus. Within the Lloyd District, the southbound routing follows 7th Avenue (from Weidler Street to Oregon Street), so as to come closer to the Lloyd Center and the many office towers in the district, but south of the convention center the route runs south along Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. and north along Grand Avenue almost all the way to OMSI. The line&#x27;s OMSI terminus is located just one block away from the new Oregon Rail Heritage Center.

At that location, the new line connects with the MAX Orange Line linking downtown with Milwaukie. The streetcars then share tracks with the Orange Line to cross the Willamette River again at the Tilikum Crossing to travel to the South Waterfront district, tying in with the existing north–south streetcar line there, and thereby creating a large loop in the overall streetcar network. For this reason, the Eastside expansion was often referred to as the &quot;Eastside Loop&quot; or the &quot;Portland Streetcar Loop&quot; – and in spring 2012 it was even officially named the &quot;Central Loop Line&quot; – but completion of the loop would come not less than three years after the opening of the Eastside line. The Orange Line was a project of TriMet, whereas the streetcar was a City of Portland effort, but TriMet and Metro agreed to permit streetcars and MAX trains to share the bridge tracks, as well as to allow buses, bicycles and pedestrians—but not private motor traffic.
The budget for the Eastside Streetcar project, which was $148.3 million as of August 2012, included the cost of purchasing additional vehicles, and in August 2009 the city placed an order with United Streetcar (see &quot;Vehicles&quot; section, above) for six cars of the same general type as those currently operated, but the quantity was later reduced to five.

The new line opened on September 22, 2012, as the Central Loop Line, or CL Line. The scheduled headways are 18 minutes on weekdays, 17 minutes on Saturdays and 20 minutes on Sundays. Its opening was concurrent with a slight service reduction on the outer sections of the existing line, now called the North-South Line (or NS Line), to 14-minute intervals on weekdays (from the previous 12–13 minutes), but has increased the average frequency to about every 7 minutes on 10th and 11th Avenues, where the two lines overlap.

==Proposed expansions==
Expansion of the streetcar system along other corridors is proposed, for the longer term. After a series of public meetings soliciting input on a draft, the city council adopted a &quot;Streetcar System Concept Plan&quot; in September 2009. The long-range plan identified potential corridors for future streetcar lines based on studies on ridership, land use, transportation patterns and development opportunities.

===Montgomery Park to Hollywood District===
In January 2018, Portland Streetcar started exploring adding service to Montgomery Park in the Northwest Industrial District. Two possible alignments have been proposed, one using NW Raleigh and NW Thurman, the other using NW Wilson and NW York. Both alignments would connect with the existing NS Line using NW 18th and NW 19th. The cost of the new alignment has not yet been determined, $370,000 in City General Funds has been requested. On December 18, 2018, the Federal Transit Administration has given a $1,076,000 grant to the extension as part of a pilot program. This will go towards study of the Wilson/York and 18th/19th couplets and a new turn around track at the Oregon Convention Center. These plans will add 2.3 miles (3.7 km) of track and double the capacity for Rose Quarter and Lloyd Center service, and the prospect of farther extension into the Hollywood neighborhood to the east have been a part of the study.
===Lake Oswego===
A proposal to add a southern extension of the streetcar to Lake Oswego was considered beginning in 2004, but was shelved in 2012 due to lack of support among Lake Oswego city officials.

In 1988, a consortium of several local governments purchased from Southern Pacific Railroad the Jefferson Branch freight rail line, which SP had ceased using in 1983, with the intention of preserving the right-of-way for future passenger rail transit use. Since 1990, the rail corridor has been kept in use by the Willamette Shore Trolley heritage streetcar service, a mostly seasonal, excursion-type operation, but local transportation officials remained interested in putting the corridor to use for mass transit in the longer term, and formal discussion increased as the opening of Portland Streetcar&#x27;s first line neared, in 2001. A 2004 study by TriMet showed that extending the Portland Streetcar system over this right-of-way could be cost-effective and would be a better choice in this corridor than building a more costly MAX (light rail) line. In December 2007, the Metro council approved undertaking environmental-impact studies for the proposed improvements and comparing the introduction of streetcar transit service with the alternative of &quot;enhanced bus service&quot;. The work was delayed by a lack of funding, but got under way in spring 2009 after the interested local jurisdictions reached agreement on financing the study, and a Draft Environmental Impact Statement.

As proposed, the line would have followed the Willamette Shore Trolley (WST) right-of-way, extending from the current SW Lowell St. terminus down SW Moody Avenue and proceeding along the WST right-of-way to Lake Oswego, with a terminus near a shopping center at N State St. and North Shore Blvd. The WST alignment was thought to relieve traffic congestion on Oregon Route 43, which parallels it and on some sections has steep hillsides where it would be cost-prohibitive to widen the highway. The route would have had 10 or 11 stations along the alignment and would be mostly double-track with two or three single-track segments where the alignment is too narrow to widen. Stops would be at Hamilton Ct., Boundary St., Pendleton St., Carolina St., Nevada St., Sellwood Bridge, Riverwood Rd., Briarwood Rd., &#x27;B&#x27; Ave., and the terminus. Up to 400 park-and-ride spaces would have been included near the terminus.

In January 2012, facing local opposition from some residents living adjacent to the right-of-way, and after losing support among Lake Oswego city officials due to cost and concerns about lifestyle changes caused by the Streetcar, the project was officially suspended.

==Comparison with light rail==
In contrast with light rail transit systems, vehicles on modern streetcar systems such as the Portland Streetcar are rarely separated from other traffic and are not given traffic-signal priority over other vehicles, except in a few situations to allow the rail cars—which cannot turn as sharply as most other motor vehicles—to make some turns. In Portland, using this &quot;mixed traffic&quot; operation has reduced the cost of constructing each segment and—by not closing traffic lanes permanently to other traffic, as is typically done with light rail—also minimized disruption to traffic flow, and allowed curbside parking to be retained, but also means slower operating speeds compared to light rail. Additional factors making the Portland Streetcar line less expensive to build per mile than light rail are that use of city streets largely eliminated the need to acquire private property for portions of the right-of-way, as has been necessary for the region&#x27;s light rail (MAX) lines, and that the vehicles&#x27; smaller size and therefore lighter weight has enabled the use of a &quot;shallower track slab&quot;. The latter means that construction of the trackway necessitated excavating to a depth of only instead of the conventional (for light rail) depth of around , significantly reducing the extent to which previously existing underground utilities had to be relocated to accommodate the trackway.

==Replication by other transit systems==
In 2005, Toronto Transit Commission officials visited Portland to evaluate the Škoda streetcars for possible use on Toronto&#x27;s streetcar system, as the smaller size is suitable for the city&#x27;s extensive street-running mixed-traffic operations. While the TTC viewed Škoda&#x27;s vehicle as a favorable replacement for its aging CLRV and ALRV fleet, Škoda did not submit a bid, and the TTC eventually ordered Flexity Outlook streetcars from Bombardier.

Portland has been cited as the first of a new generation of modern streetcar systems that have become popular in North American cities since the mid-2000s.

<text>Boston is the debut studio album by American rock band Boston, released on August 25, 1976, by Epic Records. It was produced by band guitarist Tom Scholz and John Boylan. A multi-instrumentalist and engineer who had been involved in the Boston music scene since the late 1960s, Scholz started to write and record demos in his apartment basement with singer Brad Delp, but received numerous rejections from major record labels. The demo tape fell into the hands of CBS-owned Epic, who signed the band in 1975.

Defying Epic Records&#x27;s insistence on recording the album professionally in Los Angeles, Scholz and Boylan tricked the label into thinking the band was recording on the West Coast, when in reality, the bulk was being tracked solely by Scholz in his Massachusetts home. The album&#x27;s contents are a complete recreation of the band&#x27;s demo tape, and contain songs written and composed many years prior. The album&#x27;s style, often referred to as the &quot;Boston sound&quot;, was developed through Scholz&#x27;s love for classical music, melodic hooks and early guitar-heavy rock groups such as the Kinks and the Yardbirds, as well as a number of analogue electronic effects developed by Scholz in his home studio. Besides Scholz, who played most of the instruments on nearly all of the tracks, and Delp, other musicians appear on the album, such as drummers Jim Masdea and Sib Hashian, guitarist Barry Goudreau and bassist Fran Sheehan. All except Masdea became full-time band members.

The album was released by Epic in August 1976 and broke sales records, becoming the best-selling debut LP in the US at the time, and winning the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) Century Award for the best-selling debut album. The album&#x27;s singles, &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot;, &quot;Peace of Mind&quot; and &quot;Foreplay/Long Time&quot;, were major hits, and nearly the entire album receives constant airplay on classic rock radio. The album is often regarded as a staple of 1970s rock and has been included on many lists of essential albums. It has sold at least 17 million copies in the United States alone and at least 20 million worldwide, making it one of the best-selling debut albums of all time.

==Background==
In the late 1960s, Tom Scholz began attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he first wrote music. After graduating with a master&#x27;s degree, he began working for the Polaroid Corporation in the product development division. By night, he played keyboards for bands in the Boston bar and club scene, where he collaborated with drummer Jim Masdea. The two – who shared a concept of the perfect rock band, one &quot;with crystal-clear vocals and bone-crunching guitars&quot; – viewed themselves as only part-time musicians. Despite this, the duo built a small studio near Watertown, Massachusetts to record ideas. Scholz recorded for hours, often re-recording, erasing, and discarding tapes to create &quot;a perfect song.&quot;

Both musicians later joined Mother&#x27;s Milk, a band featuring guitarist Barry Goudreau that vied for recognition in the Boston music scene. Scholz quickly went from keyboardist to lead songwriter, and the band went through dozens of lead vocalists before Brad Delp auditioned.

Delp, a former factory worker at a Danvers electric coil company, spent much of his weekends in cover bands. Delp drove to Revere Beach, where the three-piece was performing at a club named Jojo&#x27;s.

Delp was impressed that the band had recorded a demo tape and was still recording, and he earned his position in the band after auditioning for the Joe Walsh song &quot;Rocky Mountain Way&quot;. Mother&#x27;s Milk became an early version of Boston, with Goudreau on lead guitar.

By 1973, the band had a six-song demo tape ready for mailing, and Scholz and his wife Cindy sent copies to every record company they could find. The songs on the demo were &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot;, &quot;Peace of Mind&quot;, &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Band&quot;, &quot;Something About You&quot;, &quot;San Francisco Day&quot; (later changed and renamed &quot;Hitch a Ride&quot;) and &quot;Love&quot; (later changed to &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid&quot;). The group received rejection slips from several labels - RCA, Capitol, Atlantic and Elektra among the most notable - and Epic Records rejected the tape flatly with a &quot;very insulting letter&quot; signed by company head Lennie Petze that opined the band &quot;offered nothing new&quot;. The tape that received the most attention contained embryonic renditions of future songs that would appear on Boston&#x27;s debut album. Delp departed shortly after that because &quot;there just wasn&#x27;t any money coming in.&quot;

By 1975, Tom Scholz was finished with the club scene, concentrating exclusively on the demo tapes he recorded at home in his basement. Scholz was renting the house and spent much of his funds on recording equipment; at one point, he spent the money he had saved for a down payment on a future home on a used professional 12-track tape recorder made by Scully Recording Instruments.

He called Delp to provide vocals, remarking, &quot;If you can&#x27;t really afford to join the band or if you don&#x27;t want to join the band, maybe you&#x27;d just want to come down to the studio and sing on some of these tapes for me.&quot;

Scholz had given the Mother&#x27;s Milk demo to a Polaroid co-worker whose cousin worked at ABC Records (who had signed one of Scholz&#x27;s favorite bands, the James Gang). The employee forgot to mail the tape out, and it sat on his desk for months until Columbia began contacting Scholz, after which he sent the tape to ABC.

Charles McKenzie, a New England representative for ABC Records, first overheard the tape in a co-worker&#x27;s office. He called Paul Ahern, an independent record promoter in California, with whom he held a gentleman&#x27;s agreement that if either heard anything interesting, they would inform the other.

Ahern connected with Petze at Epic and informed him, even though Petze had passed on the original Mother&#x27;s Milk demos.

Epic contacted Scholz and offered a contract that first required the group to perform in a showcase for CBS representatives, as the label suspected that the &quot;band&quot; was, in reality, a &quot;mad genius at work in a basement.&quot;

Masdea had started to lose interest in the project by this time. To complete the lineup, Scholz called Goudreau and two other performers who had recorded on the early demos, bass player Fran Sheehan and drummer Dave Currier. In November 1975, the group performed for the executives in a Boston warehouse that doubled as Aerosmith&#x27;s practice facility.

One month later, CBS Records signed Mother&#x27;s Milk in a contract that required 10 albums over 6 years. Currier quit before he knew the band passed the audition, and Scholz recruited drummer Sib Hashian in his place.

Epic had signed an agreement with NABET, the union representing electrical and broadcast engineers, which specified that any recording done outside of a Columbia-owned studio but within a 250-mile radius of one of those studios required a paid union engineer to be present.

As such, the label wanted the band to travel to Los Angeles and re-record their songs with a different producer. Scholz was unhappy with being unable to be in charge, and John Boylan, a friend of a friend of Ahern, came on board the project.

Boylan&#x27;s duty was to &quot;run interference for the label and keep them happy&quot;, and he made a crucial suggestion: that the band change their name to Boston.

==Recording and production==

&quot;Boston&quot; was recorded primarily at Scholz&#x27;s Foxglove Studios in Watertown in &quot;an elaborate end run around the CBS brain trust.&quot; Epic wanted a studio version that sounded identical to the demo tape, and Scholz decided he could not work in a production studio, having adapted to home recording for several years, stating, &quot;I work[ed] alone, and that was it.&quot;

Scholz took a leave of absence from Polaroid and was gone for several months to record the band&#x27;s album. &quot;I would wake up every day and go downstairs and start playing,&quot; he recalled. Scholz grew annoyed reproducing the parts and being forced to use the same equipment on the demo.

The basement, located in a lower-middle-class neighborhood on School Street, was described by Scholz as a &quot;tiny little space next to the furnace in this hideous pine-paneled basement of my apartment house, and it flooded from time to time with God knows what.&quot;

There was a Hammond organ and a Leslie speaker stuffed in the corner of the room alongside the drums; whenever it was time to record the organ parts, they would tear the drums down and pull out the Leslie.

Boylan felt that while Scholz&#x27;s guitars &quot;sounded amazing,&quot; Scholz did not understand how to record acoustic instruments correctly and flew in engineer Paul Grupp to instruct him on microphone technique.

Boylan&#x27;s hands-on involvement would center on recording the vocals and mixing, and he took the rest of the band out to the West Coast, where they recorded &quot;Let Me Take You Home Tonight&quot;. &quot;It was a decoy,&quot; recalled Scholz, who recorded the bulk back home in Watertown without CBS&#x27;s knowledge. While Boylan arranged for Delp to have a custom-made Taylor acoustic guitar for thousands of dollars charged to the album budget, Scholz recorded such tracks as &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot; in his basement with a $100 Yamaha acoustic guitar.

That spring, Boylan returned to Watertown to hear the tracks on which Scholz had recut drums and other percussion and keyboard parts. He then hired a remote truck from Providence, Rhode Island to come to Watertown, where it ran a snake through the basement window of Scholz&#x27;s home to transfer his tracks to a 3M-79 2-inch 24-track deck. The entire recording was completed in the basement, save for Delp&#x27;s vocals, which were recorded at Capitol Studios&#x27; Studio C with Warren Dewey engineering the overdubs. Some of the equipment used in the recording of the album was designed by Scholz himself.

All vocals were double-tracked except the lead vocal, and all the parts were done by Delp in quick succession. When Scholz arrived in Los Angeles for mixing, he felt intimidated. He feared the professional engineers would view him as &quot;this hick who worked in a basement.&quot; Instead, Scholz felt they were backward in their approach and lacked the knowledge he had obtained. &quot;These people were so swept up in how cool they were and how important it was to have all this high-priced crap that they couldn&#x27;t see the forest for the trees,&quot; he said.

Boylan encountered his only real confrontation with the autocratic Scholz during the mixing stage, in which Scholz handled the guitar tracks, Boylan the drums, and Dewey the vocals, with Steve Hodge assisting. Scholz pushed guitars too high in the mix, rendering vocals inaudible at times.

The operation has been described as &quot;one of the most complex corporate capers in the history of the music business.&quot; Except for &quot;Let Me Take You Home Tonight,&quot; the album was a virtual copy of the demo tapes. The album was recorded for a few thousand dollars, a paltry amount in an industry accustomed to spending hundreds of thousands on a single recording.

==Music==

The styles of Boston have been categorized as hard rock and arena rock (though the latter had yet to have been coined at the time of the album&#x27;s release). The tracks are described as &quot;anthemic&quot; and make use of layered melodies and vocal harmonies.

&quot;Boston&quot; is composed mainly of songs written many years before their appearance on the album. Scholz wrote or co-wrote every song on the first album (except for &quot;Let Me Take You Home Tonight,&quot; written by Delp), played virtually all of the instruments, and recorded and engineered all the tracks. The &quot;Boston sound&quot; combines &quot;big, giant melodic hooks&quot; with &quot;massively heavy, classically-inspired guitar parts.&quot; For Scholz, the idea of beautiful vocal harmonies was inspired by The Left Banke. The guitar-driven aspect was influenced by the Kinks, the Yardbirds, and Blue Cheer. Another signature element of the &quot;Boston sound&quot; in terms of production involves the balance between acoustic and electric guitars. To this end, Scholz was inspired by his childhood listening to classical music, noting that the &quot;basic concept&quot; of setting the listener up for a change that is coming in the music had been explored for hundreds of years in classical compositions. The record also makes use of multiple-part harmonized guitar solos and baroque melodic devices known as mordents.

&quot;More Than a Feeling&quot; is an ode to daydreaming and contains a guitar solo reminiscent of &quot;Telstar.&quot; The track was inspired by Scholz&#x27;s love affair years prior while in school. &quot;Walk Away Renée&quot; by The Left Banke was popular at the time, and it caused Scholz to pine miserably over the girl. &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot; unintentionally incorporates a chord progression from that particular song following the line &quot;I see my Mary Ann walking away.&quot; Scholz initially felt it was his best shot at a lead single but became depressed when doubts got the best of him. Ahern loved the track and was sure it would receive maximum airplay. &quot;Peace of Mind&quot; was penned about Scholz&#x27;s Polaroid superiors and recorded around the fall of 1974. &quot;Foreplay,&quot; the extensive introduction to &quot;Long Time,&quot; was composed many years prior in 1972. &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Band,&quot; a track that dates back to the band&#x27;s Mother&#x27;s Milk demo, was inspired by Masdea&#x27;s experiences performing in various bar combos and was written just as &quot;pure fantasy.&quot; The album version still features Masdea&#x27;s drums from the demo tape. &quot;Smokin&#x27;,&quot; was written and recorded in 1973 and called &quot;Shakin&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Hitch a Ride&quot; was originally titled &quot;San Francisco Day,&quot; with lyrics starting in New York City and then planning to hitch a ride to &quot;head for the other side.&quot; This was the first song Delp re-recorded after the original Mother&#x27;s Milk vocalist left. To create the special effect of a bent note on the track&#x27;s organ solo, Scholz slowed down one of the recording reels with his finger. &quot;Something About You&quot; was originally &quot;Life Isn&#x27;t Easy&quot; and was written around 1975. As the last demo, it was the penultimate track.

The trademark sci-fi theme of the record cover was Scholz&#x27;s concept: &quot;The idea was escape; I thought of a &#x27;spaceship guitar.&#x27; &quot; The original spaceship was designed in 1976 by Paula Scher and illustrated by Roger Huyssen with lettering by Gerard Huerta for Epic Records.

==Release==

&quot;Boston&quot; was released by Epic Records on, according to varying sources, either August 23 or August 25, 1976. The album broke out of Cleveland first, and the following week, it had been added at 392 stations. Had the record failed, Scholz, then 29, planned to abandon his ambition of making a living performing music; he still worked at Polaroid after it was released and doubted its commercial success until it sold 200,000 copies. &quot;And all of a sudden I realized I was in the music business,&quot; he told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. &quot;I got word on what the sales figures were while I was still at Polaroid full-time. It wasn&#x27;t easy staying there two more weeks.&quot; Critics were kind to &quot;Boston&quot;; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;The group&#x27;s affinity for heavy rock &amp; roll provides a sense of dynamics that coheres magnetically with sophisticated progressive structures.&quot;

The album was certified gold in October 1976 and sold another 500,000 copies within 30 days, going platinum for the first time in November 1976.

By January 1977, the debut disc sold 2,000,000 copies, making it one of the fastest-selling debut albums in rock history. &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot; became a hit single on both AM Top 40 stations (with its second verse deleted for time constraints) and on FM &quot;AOR&quot; stations (with the second verse left intact).

&quot;I was at Polaroid when I first heard &#x27;More Than A Feeling&#x27; on the radio,&quot; said Tom Scholz. &quot;I was listening to somebody else&#x27;s radio. The first week the album came out, it did better than I expected.&quot; Epic Records was pleased with their new acquisition—Boston and another new band, Wild Cherry, were among Epic&#x27;s biggest success stories of 1976.

The album was afforded several accolades, including a Grammy Award nomination for Best New Artist. Boston sold 6,000,000 albums, including records, 8-tracks and cassettes by December 1977. For massive popularity, Boston was considered to rival established stars such as Peter Frampton, Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Wonder.

By 1986, the album had been certified for over 9,000,000 sales domestically, and &quot;Boston&quot; went diamond in 1990. By November 2003, the album was certified by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of 17,000,000. Worldwide, the album has sold 20,000,000 copies.

The album is the second best-selling debut album of all time in the United States, after Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27;s &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;. It is the joint eighth best-selling album in US history. &quot;Boston&quot;, along with the band&#x27;s 1978 follow-up &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;, was remastered in 2006 by Scholz.

==Reception==

The album soared, with three singles becoming Top 40 hits. All eight songs on the album received regular airplay on classic rock radio decades later. Taking a mere three weeks to earn an RIAA Gold Record Award (500,000 in unit sales) in 1976 and a Platinum Award (1,000,000 in unit sales) after three months on November 11, 1976, it was the fastest-selling debut album for any American group. It has continued to sell very well, accumulating 9,000,000 in sales by the 10th anniversary in 1986, reaching Diamond in 1990, and 17× platinum by 2003.

==Touring==
The first tour in support of the album was a short six-week promotional club tour throughout the Midwest. Boston soon found themselves on a nationwide tour that lasted 10 months. &quot;We started playing the Agoras in Cleveland and Columbus,&quot; said Delp. &quot;500–1000 seat clubs. The response was great, I was amazed that people were singing along with all the songs. It really impressed upon me the power of radio, the fact that wherever we went, they were just playing the record and people just came, and it was great.&quot; However, several bands the group opened for were less than enthusiastic to meet them. At one point, they were opening for Foghat but lost the gig when a Milwaukee disc jockey introduced Boston, not headliner Foghat, as the best rock and roll band in the world. While the band were apprehensive about opening for Black Sabbath, the experience was pleasant. &quot;The great thing about Black Sabbath was that they didn&#x27;t do soundchecks,&quot; remembered Delp. &quot;So we were afforded all the time we wanted on stage, Ozzy Osbourne would say, &#x27;Ahh, you wanna go up and play some songs, go ahead.&#x27; They couldn&#x27;t have been nicer.&quot;

Boston eventually began headlining shows in 1977 and sold out four Southern California concert halls within one week. Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band opened for Boston in Detroit. On their swing back to the Northeast, they sold out two nights in the Philadelphia Spectrum—and in their New York City debut, three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden. &quot;I sold out arenas with this group in four cities from Lincoln, Nebraska to Louisville, Kentucky,&quot; said concert promoter Bob Bagaris to &quot;Billboard&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen such universal penetration of key secondary markets by any major group. Even the biggest acts usually don&#x27;t do so well in every market.&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Boston&quot; has been described as a pivot in the transition of mainstream American rock from blues-based proto-metal to power pop, &quot;combining some of the ebullience of the rock era&#x27;s early days with the precision and technology that would mark rock record productions from then on.&quot; All eight songs—most commonly the album&#x27;s A-side—are in constant rotation on classic rock radio. Boston&#x27;s success ushered in the next wave of &quot;producer&quot; rock sound. Following the album&#x27;s success, its sound became imitated by several other prominent rock bands of the era. The record created a reference point for production values and studio technology that would stand for years. The album is hailed as one of the greatest in rock history, with an inclusion in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. The album was also ranked No. 43 on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;Definitive 200&quot; list. Vik Iyengar of AllMusic said the album is &quot;essential for any fan of classic rock.&quot;

<doc id="201771" wikidata="Q6946655" url="?curid=201771" title="My Xperience">
<text>My Xperience is a reggae album by Jamaican dancehall performer Bounty Killer, released in 1996 (see 1996 in music). Bounty Killer was one of dancehall&#x27;s biggest stars in the 1990s and his harsh hip hop-influenced songs made him a controversial figure. Most of the songs on &quot;My Xperience&quot; are morose tales of poverty and violence. The album featured the single &quot;Hip-Hopera&quot; (featuring Fugees).

The album was listed in the 1999 book &quot;The Rough Guide: Reggae: 100 Essential CDs&quot;.

==Reception==
The AllMusic review by Alex Henderson awarded the album 4.5 stars stating &quot;Those who aren&#x27;t big dancehall fans may find the hip-hop-influenced CD hard to get into; those who are heavily into it will find a lot to admire on My Xperience, which contains major dancehall hits like &quot;Living Dangerously&quot; and &quot;Virgin Island.&quot; A variety of guests join Bounty—everyone from the Fugees on &quot;Hip-Hopera&quot; to reggae singer Barrington Levy on &quot;Living Dangerously&quot; to hardcore rapper Jeru the Damaja on &quot;Suicide or Murder.&quot; Granted, dancehall has its limitations and can wear thin , but even so, My Xperience makes for an exhilarating listen&quot;.

<text>Bread is the debut album by soft rock band Bread, released in 1969.

&quot;Bread&quot; peaked at #127 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums chart. A re-recorded version of &quot;It Don&#x27;t Matter to Me&quot; was issued as a single after the release of Bread&#x27;s second album, &quot;On the Waters&quot;, and the #1 success of &quot;Make It with You&quot; in the summer of 1970. 

The album&#x27;s cover, with whimsical depictions of the band members photos on paper currency, refers to contemporary slang equating &quot;bread&quot; to money.

<doc id="201783" wikidata="Q5304514" url="?curid=201783" title="Dr Challoner's Grammar School">
<text>Dr Challoner&#x27;s Grammar School (also known as DCGS, Challoner&#x27;s Boys or simply Challoner&#x27;s) is a selective grammar school for boys, with a co-educational Sixth Form, in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, England. It was given academy status in January 2011.

It was founded in 1624 in accordance with the last will and testament of Robert Chaloner. Chaloner, a Doctor of Divinity, was Rector of Amersham from 1576 to his death in 1621. He was also a Canon of St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor from 1584.

==History==
In his will, Robert Chaloner left money to establish a grammar school in Amersham.
 &quot;… the like sume of twenty pounds yearly out of the said lands at Wavendon I give unto my wellbeloved friend Mr. William Tothill Esquire and Mr William Pennyman Esquire to erect a free gramar schoole in Amersam in the County of Bucks to be established by Deede of Feofment or otherwise as their wisdome can devise The towne and pish allotinge the Churche house for the schoole house or my successor a tenemt in the occupation of Enoch Wyar now or of late for the dwellinge house of the schoole maister whome I will to be chosen by my exequitrix my successor and Mr. Tothill afterwards by my successor and sixe of the eldest Feoffees and cheefest This I leave as a testimony of my loce to them and theire children. Orders for the school—I desire my successor to pcure from the best ordered schooles&quot;
The school was situated in Old Amersham for almost three centuries before moving, with the support of Buckinghamshire County Council, to its present position in Amersham-on-the Hill in 1905. At this time, the school embraced the principle of co-education for the first time which, according to the school&#x27;s first prospectus in 1906, was &quot;practically universal in America&quot;. Each year the boys at Challoner&#x27;s celebrate Founder&#x27;s Day where they attend St Mary&#x27;s Church in Old Amersham where Robert Chaloner was rector.

By 1937, Challoner&#x27;s was incorporated into the state system of education and by the early 1950s, the school had about 350 boys and girls on roll. However, plans for expansion to 550 pupils were overtaken by rapid population growth in the area and the decision was made to establish a separate school for girls in Little Chalfont: Dr. Challoner&#x27;s High School, which opened in 1962. The two schools continue to maintain links, collaborating especially in music and drama productions, whilst Dr Challoner&#x27;s Debating Society has staged collaborative events. Girls were admitted to the boys&#x27; school sixth form in 2016.

The continued expansion of the grammar school to its present size of over 1,350 students saw major building projects in the 1950s, 1980s, and 1990s, followed by the construction of a large astroturf pitch and improvements to the sports fields. Another floor has been added on top of the old library and the new library was reopened in early 2013.
In 2002, Challoner&#x27;s became one of the first Science Colleges in the United Kingdom. The school started a second special focus as a Language College in April 2007. In 2005, the school celebrated the 100th anniversary of the move to the current site on Chesham Road, also building the Centenary Sports Pitch. The school was commended by the 2007 Ofsted inspection team and rated outstanding in all 51 criteria.
On 1 September 2008, the school officially changed its status from a Voluntary Controlled school to a Foundation school, on the basis that &quot;the additional autonomy which foundation status offers will enabled the school to provide an even better standard of education in the future&quot;. In January 2011 the school became an Academy.

==Extracurricular==
===Robotics===
Since the school founded its robotics team in 2015, Challoner&#x27;s has competed in national and international competitions. In 2017, the school competed in the Student Robotics competition led by University of Southampton and won two awards. In 2018, a team entered into PiWars, a competition involving Raspberry Pi computers hosted at the University of Cambridge. The competition consisted of autonomous and remote controlled challenges with tasks requiring computer vision. The team came out winning the whole competition and having podium finishes on the majority of the challenges.

===Model United Nations===
The school has had large amounts of success with its Model United Nations society. Almost entirely student-led, teams have traveled to attend multiple international conferences including HABSMUN and LIMUN. The teams have been successful: at LIMUN 2017 over half of the 16 Year 12 students attending won awards and the Challoner&#x27;s team won the conference overall. In March 2018 the society competed at SPIMUN (St Petersburg International Model United Nations) where five students won awards. In 2017, the society won the &#x27;We Made a Difference Award&#x27; in the 2017 Speaker&#x27;s Schools Council Awards.

In January 2018, the school hosted its first conference, Challoner&#x27;s MUN. With over 130 students from 11 schools, the conference was one of the largest student-led activities to have ever been undertaken, having been organized by an executive team of 13 students.

==Houses==
The house system was re-established in 2004. An earlier house system with four houses named for those listed in the original school song as &quot;Buckinghamshire&#x27;s four mighty men&quot;—Challoner , Hampden , Milton and Penn —was abandoned in 1976.

There are currently six houses, each named after a previous headmaster:

The houses compete in a yearly competition, starting with the beginning of the school year in September and culminating at Sports Day, usually in June. The range of activities include sports, drama and music to code-breaking. It also offers a leadership opportunity for students in positions such as Captains, Deputy Captains, and mentors.

==Academics==

Dr Challoner&#x27;s students did well in two subjects nationally in 2003. It was one of two schools named by the Department of Education (the other being Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe) as the best performing schools nationwide in the 2003 GCSEs and named the country&#x27;s best grammar school in 2011. In the 2011 GCSEs, boys achieved a 100% pass rate with 50 of the 183 candidates earning all A*-A grades.

<text>The Sanremo Music Festival ( ), officially the Italian Song Festival (), is the most popular Italian song contest and awards ceremony, held annually in the city of Sanremo, Liguria, organized and broadcast by Italian public broadcaster RAI. It is the longest-running annual TV music competition in the world on a national level (making it one of the world&#x27;s longest-running television programmes) and it is also the basis and inspiration for the annual Eurovision Song Contest.

Unlike other awards in Italy, the Sanremo Music Festival is a competition for new songs, not an award to previous successes (like the for television, the for stage performances, and the Premio David di Donatello for motion pictures).

The first edition of the Sanremo Music Festival, held between 29 and 31 January 1951, was broadcast by RAI&#x27;s radio station Rete Rossa, and its only three participants were Nilla Pizzi, Achille Togliani, and Duo Fasano. Starting from 1955, all editions of the festival have been broadcast live by the Italian TV station Rai 1.

From 1951 to 1976, the festival took place in the Sanremo Casino, but starting from 1977, all the following editions were held in the Teatro Ariston, except in 1990, which was held at the .

The songs selected in the competition are in Italian or in any regional language, and the three most voted songs are awarded. Other special awards are also given, including the Critics&#x27; Award, created ad hoc by the press in 1982 to reward the quality of Mia Martini&#x27;s song, and named after the singer in 1996, after her death.

The Sanremo Music Festival has often been used as a method for choosing the Italian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest. It has launched the careers of some of Italy&#x27;s most successful musical acts, including Toto Cutugno, Gigliola Cinquetti,
Laura Pausini, Eros Ramazzotti, Andrea Bocelli, Giorgia, Il Volo, and Måneskin.

Between 1953 and 1971 (except in 1956), in 1990, and 1991, each song was sung twice by two different artists, each one using an individual orchestral arrangement, to illustrate the meaning of the festival as a composers&#x27; competition, not a singers&#x27; competition. During this era of the festival, it was custom that one version of the song was performed by a native Italian artist while the other version was performed by an international guest artist. This became a way for many international artists to debut their songs on the Italian market, including Louis Armstrong, Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Cher, Gloria Gaynor, Dionne Warwick, Jose Feliciano, Roberto Carlos, Paul Anka, Miriam Makeba, Bonnie Tyler, Shirley Bassey, Mungo Jerry, Kiss, Laura Branigan, Alla Pugacheva, and many others.

==History==
In the aftermath of World War II, one of the proposals to revitalize the economy and the reputation of Sanremo was to create an annual music festival to be held in the city.

In 1948 and 1949, the first two editions of the Italian Song Festival () were held in Viareggio, from an idea developed in 1947 by Aldo Valleroni. The competition was discontinued in 1950 due to financial problems, but it became the basis for the future Sanremo Music Festival.

During the summer of 1950, the administrator of the Sanremo Casino, Piero Bussetti, and the conductor of the RAI orchestra, Giulio Razzi, rediscussed the idea, deciding to launch a competition among previously unreleased songs. Officially titled (literally &quot;Festival of the Italian song&quot;), the first edition of the show was held at the Sanremo Casino on 29, 30, and 31 January 1951. The final round of the competition was broadcast by Rete Rossa, the second most important RAI radio station.
Twenty songs took part in the competition, performed by three artists only–Nilla Pizzi, Duo Fasano, and Achille Togliani.

Starting from the third edition of the festival, held in 1953, each song was performed by two different artists with different orchestras and arrangements. Two years later, in 1955, the festival made its first appearance on television, since part of the final night was also broadcast by RAI&#x27;s channel Programma Nazionale. The last night of the show was also broadcast in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.

In 1964, Gianni Ravera, who organized the 14th Sanremo Music Festival, slightly changed the rules of the contest, requiring each song to be performed once by an Italian artist and once by an international singer, who was allowed to perform the song in any language. The same rule was applied in the following year&#x27;s contest. Between 1967 and 1971, entries were not forced to be interpreted by foreign artists, but double performances were kept. Starting from 1972, each entry was sung by one artist only.

The competing artists were split for the first time into &quot;Big artists&quot; and &quot;Young artists&quot; during the Sanremo Music Festival 1974. The competition had one winner only, but the entries in the &quot;Young artists&quot; category had to go through an elimination round, while &quot;Big artists&quot; were directly admitted to the final round.

In 1977, the Sanremo Casino, which hosted all the previous editions of the contest, was closed for renovations, therefore the show moved to the Teatro Ariston. The theater later became the usual location for the annual contest, hosting it every year except in 1990, when the show was held at the Nuovo Mercato dei Fiori, also known as Palafiori.

In 1980, pre-recorded backing tracks replaced the orchestra, while playback performances were allowed in 1983 during the final round. In 1984 and 1985, all the artists were forced to perform in playback, while live performances with the orchestra were reintroduced in 1990.
During the same years, several other changes were introduced in the contest. In 1982, accredited music journalists decided to create an award to recognise the best song competing in the festival. Starting from 1983, the prize was officially awarded during the event. The critics&#x27; prize was later named after Mia Martini, who was the first artist receiving it in 1982 for her entry &quot;E non finisce mica il cielo&quot;.

Moreover, starting from 1984, the separation between newcomers and established artists was marked, introducing two different competitions with separate winners. 
In 1989, a third category, the Upcoming Artists Section, was introduced, but it was removed the following year.
Only in 1998 were the top three artists in the newcomer section allowed to compete in the main competition. This led to the victory of the debuting Annalisa Minetti, which generated some controversy and led to the reintroduction of completely separate competitions starting from 1999.

The distinction among different categories was abolished again in 2004. The following year, the contest included five different categories—Newcomers, Men, Women, Groups, and Classics. The winner of each category competed for the final victory of the contest. The category Classic was abolished in 2006, while starting from 2007, the festival came back to the rules used in the 1990s, with two completely separate competitions for established artists and newcomers.

In 2009, a new competition, held entirely online, was introduced by the artistic director of the 59th edition of the contest, Paolo Bonolis. Titled &quot;Sanremofestival.59&quot;, the contest was not held in the following years.

In December 2024, the regional administrative court of Liguria ruled that the municipality of Sanremo could not directly appoint RAI as the organizer of the event, and that, starting in 2026, a public bid must be held in order to determine the organizing company. Two months later, RAI appealed the ruling, arguing that &quot;[RAI]&#x27;s branding is inseparable from the [festival&#x27;s] format&quot;.

==&quot;Mia Martini&quot; Critics Award==
The &quot;Mia Martini&quot; Critics Award, originally named the Critics Award of the Italian Song Festival and, more informally, simply the Critics Award, is a recognition given to the best song, selected by music experts (journalists and music critics) at the Sanremo Music Festival. The prize was created in 1982 specifically to award Mia Martini&#x27;s interpretation of her song &quot;E non finisce mica il cielo&quot;.

Since 1996, the award has been named after Mia Martini, following her sudden death. A petition was launched by the founder of Mia Martini&#x27;s official club, Chez Mimi, alongside Alba Calia and Dori Ghezzi and supported by numerous Italian artists, including Mina, Luciano Pavarotti, Fabrizio De André, Lucio Dalla, and Franco Battiato. Pippo Baudo, then-artistic director of the Sanremo Festival and the Critics Award jury, decided to name the prize after the Calabrian artist, specifically because she was the artist who, until then, had won the award the most frequently (three times), as well as having been its first winner.

==Hosts==



The first edition of the Sanremo Music Festival was hosted by Nunzio Filogamo. He also hosted the next three editions of the musical event. In 2003, Pippo Baudo hosted for the eleventh time, matching the record previously held by Mike Bongiorno. He later overtook this record, hosting the Sanremo Music Festival in 2007 and in 2008. Only seven women have hosted the festival as main presenters. The first women ever to host the event alone were Lilly Lembo and Giuliana Calandra in 1961, followed by Maria Giovanna Elmi in 1978, Loretta Goggi in 1986, Raffaella Carrà in 2001, Simona Ventura in 2004, and Antonella Clerici in 2010. Hosting the event between 2020 and 2024, Amadeus joined Baudo and Bongiorno in the record for the most consecutive editions hosted, i.e., five, and established himself as the presenter with the highest number of consecutive nights hosted, at 25.

Full list of festival hosts:

==Trivia==
* Whitney Houston, an international guest at the Sanremo Festival 1987, was the only artist to be asked for an encore performance in the history of the contest until then. After singing &quot;All at Once&quot;, Houston received a standing ovation and the presenter, Pippo Baudo, asked her to perform again.
* Freddie Mercury, an international guest at the 1984 Sanremo Festival, did not want to lip sync (a rule at that year&#x27;s festival), and, in protest, he moved the microphone away from his face a few times during his performance.
* In &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; by Patricia Highsmith and its film adaptations, Dickie Greenleaf invites Tom Ripley to travel to the Sanremo Music Festival to enjoy some jazz, as a parting gesture before sending Ripley on his way. The ensuing events in Sanremo have major implications for all of the characters.
* In 1960, future Italian pop legend Mina Mazzini made her Sanremo debut. The contest helped launch her career. 
* The song &quot;Perdere l&#x27;amore&quot; was proposed in 1987 by Gianni Nazzaro and rejected in the preliminary song screening. A year later, it was proposed by Massimo Ranieri and won the contest.
* In 1990, Patty Pravo turned down the opportunity to participate in the Sanremo Music Festival with &quot;Donna con te&quot;, which was sung at the event by Anna Oxa.
* In 2007, Irene Grandi&#x27;s song &quot;Bruci la città&quot; was rejected in the screening, mainly as a decision of that year&#x27;s artistic director Pippo Baudo, who later explained that the decision was due to the poor quality of the received demo. However, the song was later released by Grandi and became one of her biggest hits.

<text>The English Electric Canberra is a British first-generation, jet-powered medium bomber. It was developed by English Electric during the mid- to late 1940s in response to a 1944 Air Ministry requirement for a successor to the wartime de Havilland Mosquito fast bomber. Among the performance requirements for the type was an outstanding high-altitude bombing capability and high speed. These were partly accomplished by making use of newly developed jet-propulsion technology. When the Canberra was introduced to service with the Royal Air Force (RAF), the type&#x27;s first operator, in May 1951, it became the service&#x27;s first jet-powered bomber.

In February 1951, a Canberra set another world record when it became the first jet aircraft to make a nonstop transatlantic flight. Throughout most of the 1950s, the Canberra could fly at a higher altitude than any other aircraft in the world, and in 1957, a Canberra established a world altitude record of . Due to its ability to evade the early jet interceptor aircraft, and its significant performance advancement over contemporary piston-engined bombers, the Canberra became a popular aircraft on the export market, being procured for service in the air forces of many nations both inside and outside of the Commonwealth of Nations. The type was also licence-produced in Australia by Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) and in the US by Martin as the B-57 Canberra. The latter produced both the slightly modified B-57A Canberra and the significantly updated B-57B.

In addition to being a tactical nuclear strike aircraft, the Canberra proved to be highly adaptable, serving in varied roles such as tactical bombing and photographic and electronic reconnaissance. Canberras served throughout the Cold War, in the Suez Crisis, Vietnam War, Falklands War, Indo-Pakistani wars, and numerous African conflicts. In several wars, each of the opposing sides had Canberras in its air force.

The Canberra served for more than 50 years with some operators. In June 2006, the RAF retired the last three of its Canberras 57 years after its first flight. Three of the Martin B-57 variant remain in service, performing meteorological and re-entry tracking work for NASA, as well as providing electronic communication (Battlefield Airborne Communications Node) testing for deployment to Afghanistan.

==Development==

===Background===

During the Second World War, a desperate demand for bomber aircraft led to many aircraft being produced by secondary manufacturers via licensed manufacturing arrangements. The English Electric company thus mass-produced thousands of piston-engined bombers, such as the Handley Page Hampden and Handley Page Halifax, and the firm became a well-established British aircraft manufacturer despite having little internal design experience. Sir George Nelson, the chairman of English Electric, decided that the company would seek to remain in the business and produce its own designs. In November 1943, the company was invited to participate in discussions over a prospective bomber that would take advantage of the newly developed jet propulsion technology.

In 1944, Westland Aircraft&#x27;s technical director and chief designer W. E. W. Petter had prepared a design study for a twin-engined fighter-bomber, the P.1056, based on two fuselage-mounted Metrovick F.2/4 &quot;Beryl&quot; engines. The aircraft used a relatively conventional aerodynamic design, Petter having determined that the necessary performance could be attained without adopting swept wings or a swept tail. The authorities doubted its suitability for operations from unprepared fields and at low altitude, but could see its potential as a bomber design; numerous manufacturers refused to take on the design. Petter left Westland to join the English Electric company in December 1944, where he was appointed by Nelson to form a design team and encouraged to develop his design. In 1945, English Electric formalised its own in-house aircraft design team to pursue this design.

The Canberra had its formal origins in a 1944 requirement issued by the Air Ministry for a successor to the de Havilland Mosquito. This requirement, the initial revision being E.3/45, sought a high-altitude, high-speed bomber, which was to be equipped with no defensive armament. According to aviation historians Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, Air Ministry officials are alleged to have had difficulty defining what they sought for the proposed type, which led to several revisions of the requirement. Further specification refinements, including B.3/45 and B.5/47, issued further details such as a three-man crew and other features such as a visual bombing capability. Several British aircraft manufacturers submitted proposals to meet the requirement, including English Electric. The firm was among those companies to be short-listed to proceed with development studies.

By June 1945, the aircraft that was to become the Canberra bore many similarities to the eventual design, despite the placement of a single, centrally mounted turbojet engine; Petter had held discussions with Rolls-Royce Ltd on the topic of the development of a scaled-up derivative of the Nene engine. In late 1945, the design was modified further with a pair of engines being adopted, instead, initially to be set in the wing roots and later to be mounted in a midwing position; this change was made principally due to centre of gravity issues imposed by the position and weight of a heavy bombload and centrally mounted single engine. The new engine position decreased the aircraft&#x27;s weight by 13% and improved the aircraft&#x27;s centre of gravity, as well as improved accessibility to the engines and related accessories; its downsides were slight thrust loss from the longer jet pipes and greater yaw during engine-out instances.

During the early stages of design, the aircraft had grown from being roughly the same size as the Mosquito to being around double its weight. Although jet-powered, the Canberra design philosophy was very much in the Mosquito mould, providing room for a substantial bomb load, fitting two of the most powerful engines available, and wrapping it in the most compact and aerodynamic package possible, an example being a leading edge formed of a single sheet of light alloy wrapped around to 40% of chord, sitting on Redux-bonded stiffeners through which the ribs were passed, the panels secured with adjustable eye-bolts, enabling a highly accurate wing profile to be maintained from the leading edge to main spar without any external joints or fastenings. Also in line with the Mosquito philosophy, the Canberra by design dispensed with defensive armament, which had historically proven unequal to fighter aircraft, and the resulting performance gain permitted the Canberra to avoid air-to-air combat entirely.

On 7 January 1946, the Ministry of Supply placed a contract for the development and production of four English Electric A.1 aircraft. It continued to be known as the English Electric A.1 until it was given the name &quot;Canberra&quot; after the capital of Australia in January 1950 by Sir George Nelson, chairman of English Electric, as Australia had become the aircraft&#x27;s first export customer.

===Prototypes and first flights===
The Air Ministry specification B.3/45 had requested the production of four prototypes. On 9 January 1946, English Electric received a contract to produce four prototypes, which received the Society of British Aerospace Companies designation &quot;A.1&quot;; work commenced on the construction of these prototype aircraft in that same year, which were all built on production jigs. Progress was slow, however, due to several factors, such as the protracted development of the Avon engine that powered the type; in October 1947, in response to Rolls-Royce&#x27;s difficulties, English Electric elected to have the second prototype modified to use the existing Nene engine in place of the Avon. The implementation of postwar military cutbacks also served to slow development.

Another external issue that affected development was the failure of the Telecommunications Research Establishment to produce the radar bombing system for the aircraft in a timely fashion. This required a redesign in 1947, changing the aircraft&#x27;s nose to accommodate a glazed tip for visual bombing by a bomb aimer, which in turn required the cockpit to be restructured to facilitate the ejection system of the additional crewmember. In 1948, the design team relocated to Warton Aerodrome, Lancashire, establishing a flight-test organisation and assembly facilities there.

Ultimately, the first of these prototypes, VN799, conducted its maiden flight on 13 May 1949. Piloted by Roland Beamont, the aircraft is claimed to have handled well, with the exception of rudder overbalance. This initial flight was flown with Avon engines, the decision to perform the type&#x27;s first flight with the Avon-equipped first prototype or the Nene-equipped second prototype, &quot;VN828&quot;, was not made until weeks beforehand. On 9 November 1949, the second prototype, VN828, the first to be equipped with the Nene engine, performed its first flight. The third and fourth followed within the following eight weeks.

Flight testing of the prototypes proved to be vice-free and required only a few modifications. The changes included the installation of a glazed nose to accommodate a bomb-aimer, due to the advanced H2S Mk9 bombing radar being unavailable for production, the turbojet engines were replaced by more powerful Rolls-Royce Avon R.A.3s, and distinctive teardrop-shaped fuel tanks were fitted under the wingtips. Refinements were also made following early flight testing to the rudder and elevator to reduce instances of buffeting, after which it is claimed that the Canberra handled much like a fighter, proving to be atypically manoeuvrable for a bomber.

The project had found considerable support from the government in the late 1940s. In March 1949, in advance of the maiden flight of the first prototype, English Electric received an instruction to proceed for production. By the time the first prototype had flown, the Air Ministry had placed orders for 132 production aircraft in bomber, reconnaissance, and training variants. On 21 April 1950, the first production-standard aircraft, designated as the Canberra B.2, conducted its maiden flight, piloted by Beamont. Proving to be free of problems, this first flight was almost immediately followed by the mainstream manufacturing of production Canberras. In May 1951, the Canberra entered RAF squadron service, No. 101 Squadron being the first to receive the type. In a testament to the aircraft&#x27;s benign handling characteristics, the transition programme for the Canberra consisted of only 20 hours in the Gloster Meteor and three hours in a dual-control Canberra trainer. Matthew Materia of Smiths Industries was pivotal in a secret Australian Government mission to fit an autopilot system to the Canberra bomber, Australia’s major air defence

===Production and licensed manufacturing===
In July 1949, as English Electric was in the process of setting up production at Samlesbury Aerodrome, a firm order was placed for 132 Canberras. The order consisted of 90 B.5/47 bomber-type aircraft, 34 PR.31/46 photo-reconnaissance aircraft, and 8 T.2/49 trainer aircraft. On 25 June 1950, what would become known as the Korean War broke out; this led to a surge of demand for the Canberra and the British government stepping in to establish a far greater level of wartime production. This led to a succession of orders for Canberra B.2s, the initial bomber variant, being placed with Avro, Handley Page, and Short Brothers; for British needs alone, English Electric produced 196 B.2s, Avro and Handley Page manufactured 75 each, and Short completed 60 aircraft – the B.2 variant of the Canberra exceeded the numbers built of any other version. Other nations, notably Australia and the United States of America, also ordered large numbers of Canberras.
In the United States, the US Air Force had identified the need to replace the obsolete B-26 Invader, and had determined that, at the time, no home-produced aircraft designs could get close to what the Canberra could already offer. Following a competition against rivals such as the Martin XB-51, USAF decided to order a total of 403 Canberras. These aircraft were licence-built by Glenn L. Martin Company as the B-57 Canberra. Martin developed several versions of the aircraft themselves. The first examples were identical to the original English Electric aircraft, following which tandem crew seating was introduced, but later B-57 models were considerably modified.

Australia had been interested in the Canberra early on, which had led to the aircraft being named after the Australian capital city. Particular interest had at one time been expressed in a potential Rolls-Royce Tay-powered version of the aircraft. The Government Aircraft Factories locally assembled 48 for the Royal Australian Air Force. These aircraft were broadly similar to the British B.2. Changes included the adoption of a modified leading edge, increased fuel capacity, and room for three starter cartridges, although in practice, all three cartridges would sometimes fire, leading to the triple starter units being loaded singly. In addition, Australian-built Canberras used a higher proportion of Australian- and US-sourced components.

In total, 901 Canberras were manufactured by the various UK-based aircraft manufacturers; when combined with overseas licence production operations, the overall global production for the Canberras totalled 1,352 aircraft. With a maximum speed of , a standard service ceiling of 48,000 ft (14,600 m), and the ability to carry a payload, the Canberra proved to be an instant success on the domestic and export markets. It was built in 27 versions that equipped a total of 35 RAF squadrons, and was exported to more than 15 countries: Australia, Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Ethiopia, France, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, Peru, Rhodesia, South Africa, Sweden, Venezuela, and West Germany.

===Photo-reconnaissance and specialised roles===
During the latter part of the Second World War, strategic reconnaissance missions performed by the RAF had been carried out by the de Havilland Mosquito. In 1946, the Air Ministry issued Specification PR.31/46 seeking a jet-powered replacement for the Mosquito. To meet the requirement, the B.2 design was modified by adding a bay forward of the wing behind the cockpit to house seven cameras. It also had an additional fuel tank in the forward part of the bomb bay and only needed a two-man crew. The prototype, designated PR.3, first flew on 19 March 1950, followed by the first of 35 production aircraft on 31 July 1952. In December 1952, the PR.3 entered RAF service, when No. 540 Squadron RAF began converting from its Mosquito PR.34 force. The Canberra PR.3 was the first aircraft to be designed for the RAF purely to perform photo-reconnaissance missions.
The initial Canberra PR.3 model was shortly succeeded by the improved PR.7 variant, which featured greater fuel capacity via wing storage, the more powerful RA.7 model of the Avon engine, and Maxaret antilock braking system. The Canberra PR.9 was the final photo-reconnaissance version; this aircraft was furnished with a new crew compartment, a redesigned inner wing section, and much more powerful RA.24 Avons. In later service, bomber models of the Canberra were often converted with cameras and other equipment suited for reconnaissance purposes.

To enable crews to convert to flying the Canberra, a trainer version was developed to meet Air Ministry Specification T.2/49. On 12 June 1951, the prototype, designated T.4, conducted its first flight. It was the same basic design as the B.2 apart from the introduction of side-by-side seating for the pilot and the instructor and the replacement of the glazed nose with a solid nose. The first production T.4 flew on 20 September 1953 and the variant entered service with No. 231 Operational Conversion Unit RAF in early 1954. In addition to those assigned to the operational conversion unit, all of the B.2-equipped bomber squadrons received at least one T.4 for training purposes.

In addition to the RAF, other users adopted the Canberra in the trainer role. The Indian Air Force operated a number of T.4 aircraft for conversion training purposes. The RAAF adopted the Australian-built Canberra T.21 model, which was broadly similar to the T.4. Argentina procured a pair of T.64 trainers during the 1970s.

From the 1960s onwards, increasing numbers of bomber-oriented Canberras were deemed surplus, as newer, faster ground-attack aircraft were introduced; this led to such aircraft being rebuilt to serve in various alternative roles, including unpiloted target aircraft, radar trainers, target tugs, radar calibration aircraft, and electronic countermeasures trainers. In addition, some Canberras that had originally been manufactured for the high-altitude bomber mission were re-equipped for low-altitude, ground-attack missions.

==Design==

The English Electric Canberra is a bomber aircraft powered by two jet engines, and able to fly at high altitudes. An early prototype operated by Rolls-Royce regularly flew to 63,000 ft, where the usable speed range (coffin corner) was only 25 knots, during Avon engine test flights. The overall design has been described as being of a simple nature, somewhat resembling a scaled-up Gloster Meteor fighter, except for its use of a mid wing. The Canberra principally differed from its preceding piston-powered wartime bombers by its use of twin Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engines. The fuselage was circular in cross section, tapered at both ends, and cockpit aside, entirely without protrusions; the line of the large, low-aspect-ratio wings was broken only by the tubular engine nacelles. The Canberra had a two-man crew in a fighter-style cabin with a large blown canopy, but delays in the development of the intended automatic radar bombsight resulted in the addition of a bomb aimer&#x27;s position housed within the nose. The pilot and navigator were positioned in a tandem arrangement on Martin-Baker ejection seats.

The wing is of single-spar construction that passes through the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage. The wingspan and total length of the Canberra are almost identical at just under . Outboard of the engine nacelles, the wing has a leading edge sweep of 4° and trailing edge sweep of −14°. All flight controls are manual, using push rods rather than cables, but are otherwise conventional. These actuate the aircraft&#x27;s flight control surfaces, including shrouded-nosed ailerons, four-section, conventional, split-type flaps, and atypical airbrakes which comprise 40 hydraulically raised fingers located on the top and bottom surfaces of the wings. Swept wings were considered, but not adopted, since the expected operational speeds did not warrant them and because they could have introduced new aerodynamic problems into what was otherwise anticipated to be a straightforward replacement for RAF Hawker Typhoon and Westland Whirlwind fighter-bombers.

The fuselage of the Canberra is of semi-monocoque construction with a pressurised nose compartment. The whole lower section of the fuselage is taken up by the sizeable bomb bay with a pair of hydraulically driven doors. The Canberra&#x27;s undercarriage used a simple arrangement, the main landing gear being equipped with a single outboard-mounted wheel and the nose gear being a twin-wheel arrangement. Due to the use of a new alloy, DTD683, the undercarriage suffered from stress corrosion cracking. Cracks would appear within only a few years. The hazard posed by an undercarriage collapse during landing led the RAF to institute regular inspections, at first using radiography before moving to more effective and reliable ultrasound technology. The Canberra structure is mainly metal, with only the forward portion of the tail fin made from wood.

Thrust was provided by a pair of axial-flow Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engines. They were mounted in the midsection of the wings using tubular trusses and links between the main mounts and the adjacent leading edge of the wing. Each engine drove a 6 kW generator for the aircraft 28 V DC electrical system, a hydraulic pump for the aircraft hydraulics, and a bleed air system for cabin pressurisation. Fuel was carried in two internally supported self-sealing fuel tanks and a lace-supported bag in the upper fuselage. The manufacturer specified that Coffman engine starters should be used for engine starting. An improvised method using compressed air was discouraged by Rolls-Royce, but some operators used air starting successfully, the benefit being significant cost savings over the use of cartridges.

Various avionics were installed on the Canberra, many with their origins during the Second World War. They included Gee-H navigation, Rebecca beacon-interrogation distance-measuring equipment, very high frequency radio, radio compass, radar altimeter, identification friend or foe, and Orange Putter radar warning receiver. Perhaps the most crucial of the mission systems was the H2S automatic radar bombsight, which was mounted in the nose; delays in the development of the H2S intended for the Canberra led to early aircraft being fitted with a T.2 optical sight for visual bombing. The optical sight was considerably inferior to radar aiming when used from high altitudes.

The Canberra could deploy many conventional weapons; typical weapons used were 250-pound, 500-pound, and 1000-pound bombs, the total bomb load could weigh up to . Two bomb-bays are housed within the fuselage, normally enclosed by conventional clam-shell doors; a rotating door was substituted for these on the Martin-built B-57 Canberras. Additional stores of up to could be carried upon underwing pylons. Operators often developed and installed their own munitions, such as Rhodesia&#x27;s antipersonnel bomblets, the Alpha bomb. A varied range of munitions was employed on Canberra fleets around the world. Antipersonnel flechette bombs were tested successfully from the Canberra by Rhodesia, but not used operationally due to international agreements.

In part due to its range limitation of just , and its inability to carry the early, bulky nuclear bombs, the Canberra was typically employed in the role of a tactical bomber as opposed to that of a strategic one. In British service, many of the Canberras that were stationed overseas were not modified to deliver nuclear weapons until as late as 1957.

==Operational history==

===Royal Air Force===

The Canberra B.2 started to enter service with 101 Squadron in January 1951, with 101 Squadron being fully equipped by May, and a further squadron, No. 9 Squadron equipping by the end of the year. The production of the Canberra was accelerated as a result of the outbreak of the Korean War, orders for the aircraft increased and outpaced production capacity, as the aircraft was designated as a &quot;super priority&quot;. A further five squadrons were able to be equipped with the Canberra by the end of 1952; however, production in the 1951–52 period had only been half of the level planned, due to shortages in skilled manpower, material, and suitable machine tools.

The Canberra replaced Mosquitos, Lincolns, and Washingtons as front-line bombers, showing a drastically improved performance, and proving to be effectively immune from interception during air defence exercises until the arrival of the Hawker Hunter. The Canberra also replaced the RAF&#x27;s Mosquitos in the reconnaissance role, with the Canberra PR.3 entering service in December 1952. The improved Canberra B.6, with more powerful engines and a greater fuel capacity, started to supplement the B.2s in the UK based squadrons of Bomber Command from June 1954, when they replaced 101 Squadrons B.2s. This freed up older B.2s to allow Canberra squadrons to form overseas, with bomber and reconnaissance Canberra wings forming in RAF Germany and on Cyprus, with squadrons also being deployed to the Far East.

The PR.7 variant of the Canberra, fitted with Avon 109 engines, executed a 1953 reconnaissance flight over the Soviet rocket launch and development site at Kapustin Yar, although the UK government has never admitted the existence of such a flight. Warned by either radar or agents inside the British government, the Soviets slightly damaged one aircraft. Further reconnaissance flights are alleged to have taken place along, and over, the borders of the Soviet Union in 1954 under the code name &quot;Project Robin&quot;, using the Canberra B.2 &quot;WH726&quot;. The USAF also used the Canberra for reconnaissance flights. The aircraft were no longer required after June 1956, following the introduction of the US Lockheed U-2 purpose-built reconnaissance aircraft; &quot;Project Robin&quot; was then terminated. These RAF Canberra overflights were later featured in the 1994 BBC &quot;Timewatch&quot; episode; &quot;Spies in the Sky&quot;, and included interviews with some of the Soviet MiG-15 pilots who had attempted to intercept them.

The Canberra was the victorious aircraft flown in The Last Great Air Race from London to Christchurch in 1953, piloted by Flight Lieutenant Roland (Monty) Burton, which touched down at Christchurch 41 minutes ahead of its closest rival, after 23 hours and 51 minutes in the air; to this day, the record has never been broken.
The Vickers Valiant entered service in 1955, capable of carrying much heavier weapon loads (including the Blue Danube nuclear weapon) over longer ranges than the Canberra. This led to the Bomber Command force of Canberras equipped for high-level conventional bombing to be gradually phased out. This did not mean the end of the Canberra in front-line service, as it proved suitable for the low-level strike and ground-attack role, and versions dedicated to this role were brought into service. The interim B(I).6, converted from the B.6 by adding provision for a pack of four Hispano 20 mm cannon in the rear bomb bay and underwing pylons for bombs and rockets, entered service in 1955, with the definitive, new-build B(I).8, which added a new forward fuselage with a fighter-style canopy for the pilot, entering service in January 1956.

During the Cold War the Canberra B.6 was used by RAF 76 Squadron to sample atomic and thermo-nuclear mushroom clouds during the British Nuclear Tests in Australia and on Christmas Island. The Canberra B.6 were fitted with specialised equipment to collect particulate samples from the mushroom clouds at various heights. It was quite risky as the equipment measuring radiation when they were in the cloud was not always accurate.

An important role for the new low-level force was tactical nuclear strike, using the Low Altitude Bombing System to allow a nuclear bomb to be delivered from low level while allowing the bomber to escape the blast of the weapon. RAF Germany&#x27;s force of four squadrons equipped with the B(I).6 and B(I).8 could carry US-owned Mark 7 nuclear bombs from 1960, which were replaced by B43 nuclear bombs, also US-owned, from 1965. Three squadrons based on Cyprus and one at Singapore were armed with British-owned Red Beard nuclear weapons.

Bomber Command retired the last of its Canberras on 11 September 1961, but the Germany, Cyprus and Singapore based squadrons continued in the nuclear strike role. The Cyprus-based squadrons and one of the RAF Germany squadrons disbanded in 1969, with the Singapore-based unit followed in 1970. The three remaining RAF Germany units, which by now had replaced the old Mark 7 bombs with newer (but still US-owned) B43 nuclear bombs, remained operational until 1972, the last Canberra bombers in RAF service.
The RAF continued to operate the Canberra after 1972, employing it for reconnaissance (with squadrons equipped with PR.7s and PR.9s being based at RAF Wyton in the UK and RAF Luqa in Malta). The PR.9s were fitted with special long-range optical photography cameras, reportedly based on those used by the Lockheed U-2, to allow high-altitude photography of targets deep inside Eastern Europe while flying along the inner German border, as well as infrared linescan cameras for low-level night reconnaissance. The RAF used Canberras to search for hidden arms dumps using false-colour photography during Operation Motorman in July 1972, when the British Army re-took Irish republican held &quot;no go areas&quot; in Belfast and Derry. Canberras were used for reconnaissance during the Bosnian War during the 1990s, where they were used to locate mass graves and during the Kosovo War in 1999. They were also operated from Uganda during the First Congo War, where they were used to search for refugees. Small numbers of specially equipped Canberras were also used for signals intelligence, being operated by 192 Squadron and then 51 Squadron from 1953 to 1976.

During the Falklands War, a plan to supply two PR.9s to the Chilean Air Force, and secretly operate them with RAF crews over the war zone, was abandoned for political reasons. The aircraft got as far as Belize before the operation was cancelled. The PR.9 variant remained in service with No. 39 (1 PRU) Squadron until July 2006 for strategic reconnaissance and photographic mapping, seeing service in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and up to June 2006, in Afghanistan. During a ceremony to mark the standing down of 39 (1 PRU) Squadron at RAF Marham on 28 July 2006, a flypast by a Canberra PR.9 on its last ever sortie was conducted.

===Royal Australian Air Force===
Shortly after the end of the Second World War, the Australian government initiated a wide-scale reorganisation of the armed forces. As part of this process, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) developed &quot;Plan D&quot; as the basis for its postwar structure; Plan D was built around the concept of a numerically smaller, but more agile air arm that would employ leading-edge technology. During the late 1940s, the RAAF decided to acquire the Canberra as a replacement for, or complement to, the Avro Lincoln, though fears were raised that the new design was not especially advanced. While Australia never introduced nuclear weapons into service, the Canberra&#x27;s ability to carry such a payload was a stated factor in its acquisition; Australia&#x27;s planned force of 48 Canberras, which held the potential for being nuclear-armed, was viewed as far more potent and deterring to potential opponents than the RAAF&#x27;s entire wartime forces of 254 heavy bombers.
The Australian government decided that the RAAF&#x27;s Canberras would be constructed domestically by the Government Aircraft Factories as opposed to being manufactured in the UK. On 29 May 1953, the first Australian-built Canberra performed its first flight at Avalon Airport, Victoria; this aircraft was delivered to the RAAF for service trials a few weeks later. In December 1953, the Canberra formally entered Australian service.

From July 1950 to July 1960, during the Malayan Emergency, Canberras from Australia, New Zealand, and the UK were deployed into Malaysia to fight against Communist guerrillas. In 1967, the RAAF deployed eight Canberras to the Vietnam War. The unit, No. 2 Squadron, was later commended for its performance by the United States Air Force. The Canberras were typically operated in the low-level bombing role, taking responsibility for South Vietnam&#x27;s southernmost military regions, regions III and IV, and allowing USAF bombers to deploy their aircraft to the Ho Chi Minh trail. While USAF Canberras were equipped with .50 caliber machine guns or 20 mm cannon for strafing, Australian Canberras were deployed to South Vietnam without guns, hence were deployed strictly for low-level bombing missions. Upon their redeployment from Vietnam in 1971, No. 2 Squadron had flown about 12,000 sorties and dropped 76,389 bombs, and lost two of their aircraft to missiles and ground fire during the course of the war.

As early as 1954, Australia recognised that the Canberra was becoming outdated, and evaluated aircraft such as the Avro Vulcan and Handley-Page Victor as potential replacements. The Canberra was incapable of providing adequate coverage of Indonesia from Australian bases, and was evaluated as having a &quot;very low&quot; chance of survival if it encountered modern fighters like the MiG-17. Political pressure for a Canberra replacement rose to a head in 1962. Australia evaluated the BAC TSR-2, Dassault Mirage IV, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, and North American A-5 Vigilante, and initially appeared to favour the TSR-2, but chose to procure the General Dynamics F-111C in October 1963. Due in part to delays in the delivery of the F-111Cs, the Canberra continued to be used by Australia for a total of 29 years before its retirement in June 1982.

===Indian Air Force===

The Canberra was the backbone of the Indian Air Force (IAF) for bombing raids and photo reconnaissance for many decades. Negotiations to acquire the Canberra as a replacement for the obsolete Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers then being used by IAF began in 1954. During the extended negotiations between Britain and India, the Soviet Union is alleged to have offered their own jet bomber, the Ilyushin Il-28, at a significantly lower price than that asked for the Canberra; by April 1956, however, the Indian government was in favour of the purchase. In January 1957, India placed a large order for the Canberra; in total, 54 B(I).58 bombers, eight PR.57 photo-reconnaissance aircraft, and six T.4 training aircraft were ordered, and deliveries began in the summer of that same year. Twelve more Canberras were ordered in September 1957, and as many as 30 more may have also been purchased by 1962.

On 10 April 1959, an Indian Canberra was shot down while performing a Reconnaissance mission over Rawalpindi. The Canberra was shot down by a F-86F Sabre flown by Flight Lieutenant M Younis. The two crew members of the Canberra ejected and were later arrested by Pakistani authorities. This incident also marked the first aerial victory of the Pakistan Air Force.

First used in combat by the IAF in 1962, the Canberra was employed during the UN campaign against the breakaway Republic of Katanga in Africa. During the Indo-Pakistani Wars of the 1960s and 1970s, the Canberra was used by both sides. The most audacious use of the bomber was in the &quot;Raid on Badin&quot; during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, when the IAF sent in the Canberra to attack a critical Pakistani radar post in West Pakistan. The raid was a complete success, the radars in Badin having been badly damaged by the bombing and put out of commission. A later raid by the IAF was attempted on Peshawar Air base with the aim of destroying, amongst other targets, several Pakistani B-57 bombers, American-built Canberras. Due to poor visibility, a road outside of the base was bombed, instead of the runway where PAF B-57 bombers were parked.

During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Indian Canberras flew a strategically important sortie against the Karachi oil tanks, which had the effect of helping the Indian Navy in their own operations, a series of missile boat attacks against the Pakistani coast. On 21 May 1999, prior to the commencement of the Kargil War, the IAF Air HQ assigned a Canberra PR.57 aircraft on a photographic mission near the Line of Control, where it took a severe blow from a FIM-92 Stinger infrared homing missile on the starboard engine; the Canberra successfully returned to base using the other engine.

The entire IAF Canberra fleet was grounded and then retired following the crash of an IAF Canberra in December 2005. After 50 years of service, the Canberra was finally retired by the IAF on 11 May 2007.

===Middle East &amp; Africa===

During the Suez Crisis, the RAF employed around 100 Canberras, flying conventional bombing and reconnaissance missions from airfields in Malta and Cyprus. A total of 278 Canberra sorties were flown, dropping 1,439 1000 lb (450 kg) bombs; however low-level strikes by smaller fighters were judged to be more effective than the night-time bombing operations performed by both the Canberra and the Vickers Valiant. In addition, many of the bombs, intended to hit Egyptian airfields, missed their targets, failing to inflict much damage to the Egyptian Air Force or to badly demoralise the enemy. While interception of the Canberra was within the capabilities of Egypt&#x27;s MiG-15s and MiG-17s, as shown by the interception of Canberras by MiG-15s prior to the Anglo-French invasion, these did not result in any losses. The only Canberra shot down during the Suez campaign was a PR.7 shot down by a Syrian Gloster Meteor fighter on 6 November 1956, the last day of the war.

The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland considered the Canberra an important objective to holding greater diplomatic sway in the African continent, and ongoing negotiations over the Baghdad treaty, and a step towards decolonisation. The Suez Crisis caused a delay in the sale, but in August 1957 18 Canberras had been earmarked to be refurbished and transferred from the RAF to the Royal Rhodesian Air Force (RRAF). Both Rhodesia and South Africa used Canberras in their respective Bush Wars; numerous aircraft were lost in the conflict, only one of which was lost by the South African Air Force
. Rhodesian B.2 Canberras together with South African B(I).12 Canberras carried out attacks on insurgents in Mozambique, usually armed with &#x27;Alpha&#x27; cluster bombs, several raids on Zambia, and attacks upon multiple insurgent bases in Angola. Ethiopian Canberras were used against Eritrea and again against Somalia during the 1970s.

===Sweden===
The Swedish Air Force purchased two Canberras from the RAF in 1960, and had these modified to T.11s by Boulton Paul. The aircraft were secretly modified in Sweden as espionage aircraft for eavesdropping on primarily Soviet, Polish, and East German military radio transmissions, although this was not publicly admitted until 10 years later. The Canberras were given the designation Tp 52, and taken into service as &quot;testing aircraft&quot;, until they were replaced by two Tp 85 Caravelles in 1971.

===South America===

====Venezuela====
On 20 April 1960, the Venezuelan Air Force used its Canberra B.2 and B(I).8s to bomb the airport at San Cristóbal, Táchira, which had been seized by rebels, led by General Jose Maria Castro León. The rebels surrendered shortly afterward. On 26 June 1961, Venezuela&#x27;s Canberras were used against rebelling Army forces in Barcelona, Venezuela.

====Peru====
Peruvian Air Force Canberras flew combat sorties against Ecuadorian positions during the Cenepa War in 1995. On 6 February 1995, a Canberra B.68 disappeared over the operations zone; the aircraft had apparently struck a hill in poor weather conditions. Peru retired its Canberras in June 2005 and the survivors put in reserve until 2008. Peru bought 9 B(I).78 ex-(B(I).8) in 1956, 6 B.72 ex-(B.2) in 1966, 3 T.74 ex-(T.4) in 1966, 6 B(I).56 ex-(B.6), 12 B(I).68 ex-(B(I).8) in 1974. They also bought 5 ex-SAAF B(I).12 ex-(B(I).8) and 1 T.74 ex-(T.4)

====Argentina====
The Argentine Air Force received 10 B.62 bombers and two T.64 trainers at the beginning of the 1970s, replacing the Avro Lincoln in the bomber role. Argentina retired its last Canberras in April 2000.

During the Falklands War in 1982, eight of them were deployed to Trelew, from the islands, to avoid congestion on the closer southern airfields. Although within operating range of the British task force, the Canberra was judged to be a limited threat due to its poor manoeuvrability compared with the British Sea Harriers.

From 1 May to 14 June 1982, Argentine Canberras made 54 sorties; 36 of them were bombing missions, of which 22 were at night against ground troops. Two aircraft were lost in combat, the first to a Sea Harrier&#x27;s AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air missile on 1 May 1982. On 13 June 1982, a second Canberra B.62 of , &quot;B-108&quot; was shot down at when it was struck by a Sea Dart missile fired from . The pilot ejected safely, but the navigator was killed. It was the last Argentine aircraft to be lost in combat during the Falklands War, with Argentine forces surrendering the next day.

===Royal New Zealand Air Force===
The Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) leased 17 Canberra B.2s and three T.4s from the RAF from 1958 to 1962 pending delivery of their own Canberras. The leased Canberras were operated by No. 75 Squadron RNZAF out of RAF Tengah, Singapore, and were used in operations during the Malayan Emergency. One aircraft was destroyed during this period.

The RNZAF took delivery of 11 B(I).12s and two T.13 trainers between 1959 and 1961, and these were operated by No. 14 Squadron RNZAF. In 1964, No. 14 Squadron was deployed to RAF Tengah and participated in the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation before returning to New Zealand in November 1966. Three of the B(I).12s were destroyed in accidents. The Canberra was replaced by the A-4K Skyhawk in 1970, and the eight surviving B(I).12s and the two T.13s were sold to India.

===Development and trials aircraft===
A number of Canberras were used by English Electric for development work and trials on new equipment. It was also used by government establishments such as the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the Royal Radar Establishment. The Canberra proved to be a useful platform for such work and was used by a number of British tests and trials establishments. A number of engine manufacturers were also lent Canberras as engine test beds: Armstrong Siddeley for the Sapphire, Bristol Siddeley for the Olympus, de Havilland Engine Company for the Gyron Junior turbojet, and Rolls-Royce Limited for the Avon. Ferranti used four different Canberra B.2s for avionics development work.

One example is &quot;WV787&quot;, built as a Canberra B.2 in 1952, it was lent to Armstrong Siddeley and fitted with Sapphire engines. It was later transferred to Ferranti for trials for the Blackburn Buccaneer&#x27;s Blue Parrot radar and fitted with a B(I).8 type nose and a Buccaneer-style radome. It next was moved to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment where it was modified to be used as a water-spray tanker aircraft for de-icing trials. It would fly in front of the aircraft being tested, which would fly into the artificial cloud created by the sprayed water to induce icing. It was retired in 1984 and later preserved at the Newark Air Museum and is a National Benchmark airframe on the National Aviation Heritage Register.

===Flight records set by Canberras===
* 21 January 1951 – first nonstop unrefuelled transatlantic crossing by a jet

<text>The Douglas Aircraft Company was an American aerospace and defense company based in Southern California. Founded in 1921 by Donald Wills Douglas Sr., it merged with McDonnell Aircraft in 1967 to form McDonnell Douglas, where it operated as a division. McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing in 1997.

==History==

===1920s===
The company was founded as the Douglas Company by Donald Wills Douglas Sr. on July 22, 1921, in Santa Monica, California, following dissolution of the Davis-Douglas Company. An early claim to fame was the first circumnavigation of the world by air in Douglas airplanes in 1924. In 1923, the U.S. Army Air Service was interested in carrying out a mission to circumnavigate the Earth for the first time by aircraft, a program called &quot;World Flight&quot;. Donald Douglas proposed a modified Douglas DT to meet the Army&#x27;s needs. The two-place, open cockpit DT biplane torpedo bomber had previously been produced for the U.S. Navy. The DTs were taken from the assembly lines at the company&#x27;s manufacturing plants in Rock Island, Illinois, and Dayton, Ohio, to be modified.

The modified aircraft known as the Douglas World Cruiser (DWC), also was the first major project for Jack Northrop who designed the fuel system for the series. After the prototype was delivered in November 1923, upon the successful completion of tests on November 19, the Army commissioned Douglas to build four production series aircraft. Due to the demanding expedition ahead, spare parts, including 15 extra Liberty L-12 engines, 14 extra sets of pontoons, and enough replacement airframe parts for two more aircraft were chosen. These were sent to airports along the route. The last of these aircraft was delivered to the U.S. Army on March 11, 1924.

The four aircraft left Seattle, Washington, on April 6, 1924, flying west, and two of these returned there on September 28 to great acclaim, while one plane had been lost under fog conditions, and another was forced down over the Atlantic and sank (the DWC prototype was then rechristened, and joined the other two in completing the North American leg of the flight). After the success of this flight, the Army Air Service ordered six similar aircraft as observation aircraft. The success of the DWC established the Douglas Aircraft Company among the major aircraft companies of the world and led it to adopt the motto &quot;First Around the World – First the World Around&quot;.

Douglas initially used a logo that combined two letter Ds with two wings extended outwards, and two Ds placed back to back to form a heart as a reference to Clan Douglas. After the success of the DWC, the company adopted a logo that showed three airplanes circling a globe. The logo eventually evolved into an aircraft, a missile, and a globe. This logo was later adopted by McDonnell Douglas in 1967, and became the basis of Boeing&#x27;s current logo after their merger in 1997.

===Pre-war===
Douglas Aircraft designed and built a wide variety of aircraft for the U.S. military, including the Navy, Army Air Forces, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard.

The company initially built torpedo bombers for the U.S. Navy, but it developed a number of different versions of these aircraft, including reconnaissance planes and airmail aircraft. Within five years, the company was building about 100 aircraft annually. Among the early employees at Douglas were Ed Heinemann, &quot;Dutch&quot; Kindelberger, Carl Cover, and Jack Northrop, who later founded the Northrop Corporation.

The company retained its military market and expanded into amphibian airplanes in the late 1920s, also moving its facilities to Clover Field at Santa Monica, California. The Santa Monica complex was so large, the mail girls used roller skates to deliver the intracompany mail. By the end of World War II, Douglas had facilities at Santa Monica, El Segundo, Long Beach, and Torrance, California; Tulsa and Midwest City, Oklahoma; and Chicago, Illinois. On November 30, 1928, the company was reorganized as the Douglas Aircraft Company.
In 1934, Douglas produced a commercial twin-engined transport plane, the Douglas DC-2, followed by the famous DC-3 in 1936. The wide range of aircraft produced by Douglas included airliners, light and medium bombers, fighter aircraft, transports, reconnaissance aircraft, and experimental aircraft.

The company is most famous for the &quot;DC&quot; (Douglas Commercial) series of commercial aircraft, including what is often regarded as the most significant transport aircraft ever made: the Douglas DC-3, which was also produced as a military transport known as the C-47 Skytrain or &quot;Dakota&quot; in British service. Many Douglas aircraft have long service lives.

===World War II===
During World War II, Douglas joined the BVD (Boeing-Vega-Douglas) consortium to produce the B-17 Flying Fortress. After the war, Douglas built another Boeing design under license, the B-47 Stratojet turbojet-powered bomber, using a government-owned factory in Marietta, Georgia.
World War II was a major boost for Douglas. Douglas ranked fifth among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts. The company produced almost 30,000 aircraft from 1942 to 1945, and its workforce swelled to 160,000. The company produced a number of aircraft including the C-47 Skytrain, the DB-7 (known as the A-20, Havoc or Boston), the SBD Dauntless dive bomber, and the A-26 Invader.

===Post-war===

Douglas Aircraft suffered cutbacks at the end of the war, with an end to government aircraft orders and a surplus of aircraft. It was necessary to cut heavily into its workforce, letting go of nearly 100,000 workers.

The United States Army Air Forces established &#x27;Project RAND&#x27; (Research ANd Development) with the objective of looking into long-range planning of future weapons. In March 1946, Douglas Aircraft Company was granted the contract to research on intercontinental warfare. Project RAND later become the RAND Corporation.

Douglas continued to develop new aircraft, including the successful four-engined Douglas DC-6 (1946) and its last propeller-driven commercial aircraft, the Douglas DC-7 (1953). The company had moved into jet propulsion, producing its first for the U.S. Navy — the straight-winged F3D Skyknight in 1948 and then the more &quot;jet age&quot; style F4D Skyray in 1951. Douglas also made commercial jets, producing the Douglas DC-8 in 1958 to compete with the new Boeing 707.

Douglas was a pioneer in related fields, such as ejection seats, air-to-air missiles, surface-to-air missiles, and air-to-surface missiles, launch rockets, bombs, and bomb racks.

The company was ready to enter the new missile business during the 1950s. Douglas moved from producing air-to-air rockets and missiles to entire missile systems under the 1956 Nike missile program and became the main contractor for the Skybolt air-launched ballistic missile program and the Thor ballistic missile program. Douglas also earned contracts from NASA, most notably for designing the S-IVB stage of the Saturn IB and Saturn V rockets.

=== Mergers ===
In 1967, the company was struggling to expand production to meet demand for DC-8 and DC-9 airliners and the A-4 Skyhawk military attack aircraft. The company was also struggling with quality and cash flow problems and DC-10 development costs, as well as shortages due to the Vietnam War. Under the circumstances, Douglas was very receptive to an offer from McDonnell Aircraft Corporation. On April 28, 1967, after almost four years of merger talks, the two companies merged as McDonnell Douglas Corporation.

The two companies seemed to be a good match for each other. McDonnell was a major defense contractor, but had almost no civilian business. Douglas&#x27; commercial contracts would allow McDonnell to withstand any downturns in procurement. Conversely, McDonnell had enough revenue to help solve Douglas&#x27; financial problems; soon after the merger was announced, McDonnell bought 1.5 million shares of Douglas stock to help Douglas meet &quot;immediate financial requirements&quot;.

The merged company was based at McDonnell&#x27;s facility in St. Louis, Missouri. It adopted a modified version of Douglas&#x27; logo. Donald Wills Douglas Sr. became honorary chairman of the merged company, a post he would hold until his death in 1981. Douglas Aircraft Company continued as a wholly owned subsidiary of McDonnell Douglas, with Douglas&#x27; son, Donald Wills Douglas Jr., as president. Later, former McDonnell president David S. Lewis became chairman of Douglas Aircraft. His successful turnaround of the division allowed him to become president of McDonnell Douglas in 1969. Meanwhile, Douglas&#x27; space and missiles division became part of a new subsidiary called McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Company.

McDonnell Douglas later merged with its rival Boeing in 1997. Boeing merged Douglas Aircraft into the Boeing Commercial Airplanes division, and retired the Douglas Aircraft name after 76 years. The last Long Beach-built commercial aircraft, the Boeing 717 (third generation version of the Douglas DC-9), ceased production in May 2006. By 2011, the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III was the last aircraft being assembled at the Long Beach facility; the final C-17 was assembled in late 2015. However, the Douglas&#x27; former logo is preserved on the facility though no longer used by Boeing.

<doc id="201799" wikidata="Q5588630" url="?curid=201799" title="Governance of England">
<text>There has not been a government of England since 1707 when the Kingdom of England ceased to exist as a sovereign state, as it merged with the Kingdom of Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. The Kingdom of Great Britain continued from 1707 until 1801 when it merged with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which itself became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) in 1922 (in reality; in name in 1927) upon independence for most of the island of Ireland.

==Background==
The UK since then has gone through significant change to its system of government, with devolved parliaments, assemblies and governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. England, however, remains under the full jurisdiction, on all matters, of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the UK government as no devolved administration has been created for England within the new structure. 

This situation led to the anomaly, known as the West Lothian question, which is that Scottish Members of Parliament (MPs) have been able to vote on legislation that affects only England whereas English MPs have been unable to vote on certain Scottish matters due to devolution. In some cases, such as top-up university tuition fees and foundation hospitals, the votes of Scottish MPs have been crucial in helping pass legislation for England that the majority of English MPs have opposed. An attempt was made to address this anomaly in 2015 through the use of an English votes for English laws procedure which aims to ensure that legislation affecting only England requires a majority vote of MPs representing English constituencies.

Another possible solution to the West Lothian question would have been devolution to the English regions but attempts have been unsuccessful so far. Amongst the parts of England, Greater London has a degree of devolved power (although weaker than that of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) with power vested in an elected Mayor of London, currently Sadiq Khan and the London Assembly. 

The country is therefore officially divided into the following in terms of governance:
* The nine English regions,
* The modern day local authority areas,
* The geographical/ceremonial counties of England.

The incumbent UK government has no plans to create a devolved English parliament and corresponding English executive.

==&quot;England-only&quot; policy areas==
The UK central government retains the following powers in relation to England which are exercised by devolved governments in the rest of the United Kingdom:

*Agriculture
*Culture
*Education
*Environment
*Health (including social care)
*Housing
*Local government
*Road transport (including buses, cycling and local transport) 
*Sport
*Tourism

==&quot;England-only&quot; departments and agencies of the UK central government==
Prior to 1999, the Scottish Office, Welsh Office and Northern Ireland Office, exercised a wide range of government functions in their respective nations. After devolved administrations were established, secretaries of state for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland remained in place to represent the interests of people in the devolved nations at UK Cabinet level and to act as a conduit between central government and the devolved administrations. England however remains under the responsibility of several subject-specific government departments, many with broader UK-wide roles. There is no cabinet level secretary whose remit is to represent England as a whole. 

Within the UK central government, there are several ministerial departments, non-ministerial departments, executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies which have responsibilities for matters affecting England alone.

===Ministerial departments===
*Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. 
*Department for Education 
*Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
*Department of Health and Social Care

The following ministerial departments deal mainly with matters affecting England though they also have some UK-wide responsibilities in certain areas;

*Department for Transport
*Department for Culture, Media and Sport

===Non-ministerial departments===
*Forestry Commission
*Office for Standards in Education, Children&#x27;s Services and Skills (Ofsted)
*Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual)

===Executive agencies===
*Active Travel England
*Education and Skills Funding Agency
*Health Security Agency
*Planning Inspectorate
*Rural Payments Agency
*Standards and Testing Agency
*Teaching Regulation Agency

===Non-departmental public bodies===
*Arts Council England
*Care Quality Commission
*Children&#x27;s Commissioner for England
*Environment Agency
*Forestry England
*Historic England
*Homes England
*Natural England
*NHS England
*NHS Resolution
*Office for Students
*Office of the Schools Adjudicator
*Regulator of Social Housing
*School Teachers&#x27; Review Body
*Skills England
*Social Work England
*Sport England
*VisitEngland

===Tribunals===

*NHS Shared Business Services
*UK Sports Institute (previously known as the English Institute for Sport)

==&#x27;England-only&#x27; mechanisms in the UK parliament==
Unlike Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which have had their own devolved legislatures since the late 1990s, England remains under the full jurisdiction of the United Kingdom parliament based in Westminster. In the parliament elected in 2024, 543 members represented constituencies in England out of a total of 650.

Some mechanisms exist within the UK parliament to allow members elected from constituencies elected in England to discuss issues relating to the nation as a whole or to specific regions of England.

The Regional Affairs Committee was established in 2000. It has 13 members, however any MP from a constituency in England may attend and participate in its procedures effectively making it a &quot;de facto&quot; English grand committee. The standing order establishing the Regional Affairs Committee remains in force, however the committee last met in 2024 and no appointments have been made to it since 2005.

Eight Regional Grand Committees and Regional Select Committees existed between 2008 and 2010 for the eight regions of England outside Greater London.

As part of a commitment to introduce a policy known as English votes for English laws, prime minister David Cameron established a Legislative Grand Committee in 2015 in an attempt to give English MPs a greater say over legislation that only applies to England. The system of English Votes for English Laws was abolished by Boris Johnson&#x27;s Conservative government in 2021.

== Devolved governance within England==
In 1994, England was divided into nine regions, each with its own government office by John Major&#x27;s Conservative government.

A strategic local authority for the London region, known as the Greater London Authority (GLA) was established by Tony Blair&#x27;s Labour government in 2000 following a successful referendum held two years earlier. The GLA consists of a directly-elected Mayor of London and an elected London Assembly.

Regional Development Agencies were established in 1998 in all nine regions and unelected regional chambers made up of local councillors, business leaders and other stakeholders, were established in the eight regions outside London in 1999. An English Regions Network was formed as a collective voice for England&#x27;s eight regional chambers and the London Assembly. Plans for elected regional assemblies in the rest of England were dropped following an unsuccessful referendum held in the North East region in 2004. Regional chambers were phased out between 2008 and 2010, with some of their functions being assumed by Local authority leaders&#x27; boards. Regional Development Agencies were abolished in 2012. 

The first Combined authority was established in Greater Manchester in 2011. This was initially an indirectly elected body, administered by a board of leaders of the local authorities within its area. Additional combined authorities were formed in the following years, mainly centered around urban areas. In 2017, some combined authorities elected mayors for the first time. As of October 2024, there are 11 mayoral combined authorities in England with proposals for more, both mayoral and non-mayoral, to be established in the future. 

Since July 2024, responsibility for devolution and local government in England falls to the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, supported by a Minister of State for Local Government and English Devolution, both within the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. A Minister for London existed between 1994 and 2010 and again between 2016 and 2024. Part-time Regional Ministers were appointed in the eight regions outside London between 2007 and 2010. 

===Mayoral Council for England and the Council of Nations and Regions===

In 2024, the newly elected Labour government established a Mayoral Council for England, chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister, to bring together ministers from the UK government, the Mayor of London and the mayors of England&#x27;s combined authorities. As the government hopes that combined authorities will be established throughout England, the Mayoral Council would eventually evolve into an all England forum. In October 2024, 48% of the population and 26% of the land area of England is represented on the Mayoral Council. 

Additionally a UK wide Council of the Nations and Regions was formed which includes the Prime Minister, the First Ministers of Scotland and Wales, the First and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, the Mayor of London and the combined authority mayors.

<doc id="201802" wikidata="Q1429513" url="?curid=201802" title="Linux Professional Institute">
<text>The Linux Professional Institute (LPI) is a Canadian non-profit organisation and oriented towards certifications for Linux, BSD and open-source software-based technologies. It was founded in October 1999.

== Certification Programs ==

The company offers its exams in numerous countries and languages. These exams are primarily multiple choice questions, with some written answers. These are either taken using a computer based system, or using a paper based exam.

The organization allows community participation in creating and updating exams. Persons unaffiliated with the company can use exam Objectives Development wiki, or the Exam Development Mailing List to participate in the creation of new exams and the update of the existing ones. The exams are intended to be distribution-neutral rather than emphasize a particular distribution of family thereof.

LPI has three different certification program tracks:

Essentials Track:

* Linux Professional Institute Linux Essentials
* Linux Professional Institute Security Essentials
* Linux Professional Institute Web Development Essentials

Linux Professional Track:

*Linux Professional Institute LPIC-1
*Linux Professional Institute LPIC-2
*Linux Professional Institute LPIC-3

Open Technology Track:

*Linux Professional Institute DevOps Tools Engineer
*Linux Professional Institute BSD Specialist

== Partner Programs ==
Linux Professional Institute&#x27;s Partner Programs are created to assist companies and organizations that are involved in, use or teach open source.

== Organization ==
The Linux Professional Institute Inc. was incorporated as a Canadian non-profit organization on October 25, 1999. It is headquartered near Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is led by a board of directors. Members of the Board are: Uira Ribeiro (Chairman), Brian Clemens (Vice-Chair), Michinori Nakahara, Emmanuel Nguimbus, Ricardo Prudenciato, Dorothy Gordon, Klaus Knopper, Ted Matsumura, Uira Ribeiro and Thiago Sobral. Jon &quot;maddog&quot; Hall is the Chair Emeritus.
== Exams ==
The exams are not normally administered by Linux Professional Institute Inc., but instead through one of the Pearson VUE test centres an online through OnVUE. A number of exams are also offered at major Linux and IT trade shows and conferences, where the exams are often available at a reduced price. Beta exams are offered as part of the community feedback process and are free of charge.

== International Regional Partners ==
LPI seeks to increase adoption of Linux in part through what it terms its &quot;Regional Enablement Initiative&quot; focuses on identifying the partner organizations that can adopt or otherwise promote adoption.

== Recertification Policy ==
LPI has changed its recertification policy three times from its founding. At first there was no recertification policy, but on September 1, 2004, LPI decided to introduce a ten-year recertification policy. Certification designations earned before September 1, 2004, were considered lifetime designations and were not affected by that policy. Again on December 1, 2006, LPI further reduced the recertification policy to a period of five years. Candidates who have earned LPIC certifications will have to re-certify every five years or alternatively earn a higher certification status even if their certification was earned prior to September 1, 2004. However, certification designations earned prior to September 1, 2003, were considered ACTIVE certifications until September 1, 2008.

<text>BearingPoint (parent company: BearingPoint Europe Holdings B.V.) is a multinational management and technology consulting firm headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands. It has operations in 24 countries with around 6,200 employees.

The firm originated from the consulting services operations of KPMG; they became a distinct business unit in 1997, and demerged entirely in 2000. After an IPO in 2001, the company was renamed BearingPoint Inc. in October 2002.

In February 2009 the company&#x27;s US unit filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Parts of the business were sold to Deloitte, PwC, CSC, and Perot Systems. 
Following restructuring and a management buyout in August 2009, BearingPoint&#x27;s continuing operations were organized as a Netherlands-based partnership.

==History==

===November 1997 to October 2002 (KPMG Consulting)===
BearingPoint&#x27;s origins lie in the consulting services operations of KPMG, which were established as a distinct business unit in 1997. KPMG had been providing consulting services to clients since its first contract with the US Navy prior to World War I. On 31 January 2000, KPMG formally spun off the consulting unit as KPMG Consulting, LLC. On 8 February 2001, the company went public on the NASDAQ market at $18 a share under the ticker &quot;KCIN.&quot;

Over the next year and a half, the company acquired some of KPMG&#x27;s country consulting practices, plus country practices and hiring from Arthur Andersen’s business consulting unit. 

===October 2002 to August 2009 (BearingPoint Inc.)===
On 2 October 2002, the company was re-named BearingPoint and the next day began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker &quot;BE.&quot;

After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the company acquired a $9 million contract to outline and implement new economic regulations and institutions for the country, heavily focusing on neoliberal policies such as large-scale privatizations. According to a report by Stephen Foley, &quot;BearingPoint employees gave $117,000 (£60,000) to the 2000 and 2004 Bush election campaigns, more than any other Iraq contractor.&quot;

BearingPoint was late in filing its financial reports through 2007. The Company said its net loss for the first quarter ended 31 March 2007 narrowed as revenue grew and costs declined. The company recorded a net loss of $61.7 million, or 29 cents per share for the first quarter, compared with a loss of $72.7 million, or 34 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. The company recorded a net loss of $64.0 million, or 30 cents per share for the second quarter, compared with a loss of $2.85 million, or 1 cent per share, in the same period a year earlier. BearingPoint&#x27;s shareholders&#x27; deficit was $365 million as of the close of the second quarter 2007 with a total accumulated deficit of $1.9 billion. On 11 August 2008, the company reported its first net income in three years and, as of the third quarter of 2008, had reported operating income for three consecutive quarters. During the third quarter of 2008, BearingPoint said its net loss was $30.5 million or $0.14 a share, an improvement of $37.5 million compared to the third quarter of 2007. BearingPoint&#x27;s shareholders&#x27; deficit was $469.2 million as of the close of the third quarter 2008.

BearingPoint had difficulties with several major clients, including an outsourcing arrangement with Hawaiian Telcom. On 7 February 2007, BearingPoint announced that it had reached a settlement with Hawaiian Telcom due to issues with an IT system contract, paying the Hawaii telco $52 million and erasing an additional $30 million in previously submitted invoices. In exchange, Hawaiian Telcom released BearingPoint from any further liability. A day later, Hawaiian Telcom announced that it had signed a contract with Accenture to take over BearingPoint&#x27;s role in their systems development.

On 10 December 2008, BearingPoint filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation of the company with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect a previously approved reverse stock split of the company&#x27;s outstanding common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a ratio of one-for-fifty. The reverse stock split became effective at 6:01 p.m., Eastern Time, on 10 December 2008, at which time every fifty shares of Common Stock that were issued and outstanding automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of Common Stock. On 13 November 2008, BearingPoint received notice from NYSE Regulation, Inc. (NYSE) that the NYSE had decided to suspend BearingPoint&#x27;s common stock from trading prior to the market opening on 17 November 2008.

The company filed for Chapter 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York on 18 February 2009, with $2.23 billion in total debt and $1.76 billion in total assets as of 30 September. The filing included only the company&#x27;s U.S. operations. Unable to sustain the heavy debt load resulting from ill-advised expansion moves, costly management errors and audit fees associated with the bankruptcy process, the company negotiated debt for equity swaps with its creditors and zeroed the value of its common shares, wiping out existing investors.

By May 2009, the company&#x27;s Japan business unit and North American Commercial Services practice had been sold to PwC and its North American Public Services practice had been sold to Deloitte. Its Brazil unit was sold to CSC in July 2009 and its China unit was sold to Perot Systems in October of the same year.

===August 2009 to present (BearingPoint partnership)===
In 2009, 123 European executives bought-out BearingPoint&#x27;s EMEA operations for $69 million and carried on the BearingPoint name as a newly-formed partnership. It made 13 acquisitions from 2018 to early 2024 and opened new offices abroad in India, the United States, and China.

In Australia, BearingPoint completed a local management buy-out in September 2009. The China-based information technology company HiSoft acquired BearingPoint Australia for an undisclosed sum in July 2012.

The European BearingPoint partnership has grown its revenues since becoming independent, from €441 million (2009) to €1.017 billion (2024). It now has offices in 19 European countries, outside EMEA the firm has offices in Asia and the US, as part of its strategy of expanding its reach across the G-20 countries and globally. To this end, BearingPoint also formed strategic alliances with West Monroe Partners in North America, Grupo ASSA in South America and ABeam in Asia.

==Services==
The modern BearingPoint partnership was formed after a 2009 bankruptcy of its predecessor, BearingPoint Inc., which used to be one of the world&#x27;s largest business and IT consulting firms. BearingPoint was initially known for purchasing and installing IT equipment. Over time, it developed more of a focus on professional services and consulting for large institutions.

BearingPoint provides management and IT consulting services under three lines of business: Consulting, Products, and Capital. BearingPoint works in areas like streamlining business processes and IT security, largely for big companies and governments.

In 2024, BearingPoint completed about 1,800 projects in 32 countries that year. However, the company&#x27;s largest market is in Germany, where it is the sixth largest consultancy in the country.

<text>Sir Barnes Neville Wallis (26 September 1887 – 30 October 1979) was an English engineer and inventor. He is best known for inventing the bouncing bomb used by the Royal Air Force in Operation Chastise (the &quot;Dambusters&quot; raid) to attack the dams of the Ruhr Valley during World War II.

The raid was the subject of the 1955 film &quot;The Dam Busters&quot;, in which Wallis was played by Michael Redgrave. Among his other inventions were his version of the geodetic airframe and the earthquake bomb, including designs such as the Tallboy and Grand Slam bombs.

== Early life and education ==
Barnes Wallis was born in Ripley, Derbyshire, to general practitioner Charles George Wallis (1859–1945) and his wife Edith Eyre (1859–1911), daughter of Rev. John Ashby. The Wallis family subsequently moved to New Cross, south London, living in &quot;straitened, genteel circumstances&quot; after Charles Wallis was crippled by polio in 1893. He was educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital in Horsham and Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Hatcham Boys&#x27; Grammar School in southeast London, leaving school at seventeen to start work in January 1905 at Thames Engineering Works at Blackheath, southeast London. He subsequently changed his apprenticeship to J. Samuel White&#x27;s, the shipbuilders based at Cowes on the Isle of Wight. He originally trained as a marine engineer and in 1922 he took a degree in engineering via the University of London External Programme.

== Aircraft and geodetic construction ==

Wallis left J. Samuel White&#x27;s in 1913 when an opportunity arose for him as an aircraft designer, at first working on airships and later aeroplanes. He joined Vickers – later part of Vickers-Armstrongs and then part of the British Aircraft Corporation – and worked for them until his retirement in 1971. There he worked on the Admiralty&#x27;s first rigid airship HMA No. 9r under H. B. Pratt, helping to nurse it though its political stop-go career and protracted development. The first airship of his own design, the R80, incorporated many technical innovations and flew in 1920.
By the time he came to design the R100, the airship for which he is best known, in 1930 he had developed his revolutionary geodetic construction (also known as geodesic), which he applied to the gasbag framing. He also pioneered, along with John Edwin Temple, the use of light alloy and production engineering in the structural design of the R100. Nevil Shute Norway, later to become a writer under the name of Nevil Shute, was the chief calculator for the project, responsible for calculating the stresses on the frame.

Despite a better-than-expected performance and a successful return flight to Canada in 1930, the R100 was broken up following the crash near Beauvais in northern France of its &quot;sister&quot; ship, the R101 (which was designed and built by a team from the Government&#x27;s Air Ministry). The later destruction of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; led to the abandonment of airships as a mode of mass transport.
By the time of the R101 crash, Wallis had moved to the Vickers aircraft factory at the Brooklands motor circuit and aerodrome between Byfleet and Weybridge in Surrey. The prewar aircraft designs of Rex Pierson, the Wellesley, the Wellington and the later Warwick and Windsor all employed Wallis&#x27;s geodetic design in the fuselage and wing structures.

The Wellington had one of the most robust airframes ever developed, and pictures of its skeleton largely shot away, but still sound enough to bring its crew home safely, are still impressive. The geodetic construction offered a light and strong airframe (compared to conventional designs), with clearly defined space within for fuel tanks, payload and so on. However the technique was not easily transferred to other aircraft manufacturers, nor was Vickers able to build other designs in factories tooled for geodetic work.

== Bombs ==
After the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe in 1939, Wallis saw a need for strategic bombing to destroy the enemy&#x27;s ability to wage war and he wrote a paper titled &quot;A Note on a Method of Attacking the Axis Powers&quot;. Referring to the enemy&#x27;s power supplies, he wrote (as Axiom 3): &quot;If their destruction or paralysis can be accomplished they offer a means of rendering the enemy utterly incapable of continuing to prosecute the war&quot;. As a means to do this, he proposed huge bombs that could concentrate their force and destroy targets which were otherwise unlikely to be affected. Wallis&#x27;s first super-large bomb design came out at some ten tons, far more than any current bomber could carry. Rather than drop the idea, this led him to suggest a plane that could carry it – the &quot;Victory Bomber&quot;.
Early in 1942, Wallis began experimenting with skipping marbles over water tanks in his garden, leading to his April 1942 paper &quot;Spherical Bomb – Surface Torpedo&quot;. The idea was that a bomb could skip over the water surface, avoiding torpedo nets, and sink directly next to a battleship or dam wall as a depth charge, with the surrounding water concentrating the force of the explosion on the target.

A crucial innovation was to spin the bomb. The spin direction determined the number of bounces/range of the bomb. A change to backspin (rather than top-spin), was put forward by another Vickers designer, George Edwards, based on his knowledge as a cricketer. Spin caused the bomb to trail behind the dropping aircraft (decreasing the chance of that aircraft being damaged by the force of the explosion below), increased the range of the bomb, and also prevented it from moving away from the target wall as it sank. After some initial scepticism, the Air Force accepted Wallis&#x27;s bouncing bomb (codenamed &quot;Upkeep&quot;) for attacks on the Möhne, Eder and Sorpe dams in the Ruhr area.

The raid on these dams in May 1943 (Operation &quot;Chastise&quot;) was immortalised in Paul Brickhill&#x27;s 1951 book &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; and the 1955 film of the same name. The Möhne and Eder dams were successfully breached, causing damage to German factories and disrupting hydro-electric power.
After the success of the bouncing bomb, Wallis was able to return to his huge bombs, producing first the Tallboy (6 tonnes) and then the Grand Slam (10 tonnes) deep-penetration earthquake bombs. These were not the same as the 5-tonne &quot;blockbuster&quot; bomb, which was a conventional blast bomb.

Although there was still no aircraft capable of lifting these two bombs to their optimal release altitude, they could be dropped from a lower height, entering the earth at supersonic speed and penetrating to a depth of 20 metres before exploding. They were used on strategic German targets such as V-2 rocket launch sites, the V-3 supergun bunker, submarine pens and other reinforced structures, large civil constructions such as viaducts and bridges, as well as the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. They were the forerunners of modern bunker-busting bombs.

== Post-war research ==

=== Aircraft design ===
Having been dispersed with the Design Office from Brooklands to the nearby Burhill Golf Club in Hersham, after the Vickers factory was badly bombed in September 1940, Wallis returned to Brooklands in November 1945 as head of the Vickers-Armstrongs Research &amp; Development Department which was based in the former motor circuit&#x27;s 1907 clubhouse. Here he and his staff worked on many futuristic aerospace projects including supersonic flight and &quot;swing-wing&quot; technology (later used in the Panavia Tornado and other aircraft types). Following the high death toll of the aircrews involved in the Dambusters raid, he made a conscious effort never again to endanger the lives of his test pilots. His designs were extensively tested in model form, and consequently he became a pioneer in the remote control of aircraft.

A massive Stratosphere Chamber (which was the world&#x27;s largest facility of its type) was designed and built beside the clubhouse by 1948. It became the focus for much R&amp;D work under Wallis&#x27;s direction in the 1950s and 1960s, including research into supersonic aerodynamics that contributed to the design of Concorde, before finally closing by 1980. This unique structure was restored at Brooklands Museum thanks to a grant from the AIM-Biffa fund in 2013 and was officially reopened by Mary Stopes-Roe, Barnes Wallis&#x27;s daughter, on 13 March 2014.
Although he did not invent the concept, Wallis did much pioneering engineering work to make the swing-wing functional. He developed the wing-controlled aerodyne, a concept for a tailless aeroplane controlled entirely by wing movement with no separate control surfaces. His &quot;Wild Goose&quot;, designed in the late 1940s, was intended to use laminar flow, and alongside it he also worked on the Green Lizard cruise missile and the Heston JC.9 manned experimental aeroplane. The &quot;Swallow&quot; was a supersonic development of Wild Goose, designed in the mid-1950s, which could have been developed for either military or civil applications. Both Wild Goose and Swallow were flight tested as large (30 ft span) flying scale models, based at Predannack in Cornwall. However, despite promising wind tunnel and model work, his designs were not adopted. Government funding for &quot;Swallow&quot; was cancelled in the round of cuts following the Sandys Defence White Paper in 1957, although Vickers continued model trials with some support from the RAE.

An attempt to gain American funding led Wallis to initiate a joint NASA-Vickers study. NASA found aerodynamic problems with the Swallow and, informed also by their work on the Bell X-5, settled for a conventional tail which would eventually lead in turn to the TFX programme and the General Dynamics F-111. In the UK, Vickers submitted a wing-controlled aerodyne for specification OR.346 for a reconnaissance/strike-fighter-bomber, effectively the TSR-2 specification with added fighter capability. When Maurice Brennan left Vickers for Folland he worked on the FO.147, a variable-sweep development of the Gnat lightweight fighter-trainer, offering both tailed and tailless options. Wallis&#x27;s ideas were ultimately passed over in the UK in favour of the fixed-wing BAC TSR-2 and Concorde. He was critical of both, believing that swing-wing designs would have been more appropriate. In the mid-1960s, TSR-2 was ignominiously scrapped in favour of the American F-111, which had swing-wings influenced by Wallis&#x27;s work at NASA, although this order was also subsequently cancelled.

=== Other work ===

In the 1950s, Wallis developed an experimental rocket-propelled torpedo codenamed HEYDAY. It was powered by compressed air and hydrogen peroxide, and had an unusual streamlined shape designed to maintain laminar flow over much of its length. Tests were conducted from Portland Breakwater in Dorset. The only surviving example is on display in the Explosion Museum of Naval Firepower at Gosport.

In 1955, Wallis agreed to act as a consultant to the project to build the Parkes Radio Telescope in Australia. Some of the ideas he suggested are the same as or closely related to the final design, including the idea of supporting the dish at its centre, the geodetic structure of the dish and the master equatorial control system. Unhappy with the direction it had taken, Wallis left the project halfway into the design study and refused to accept his £1,000 consultant&#x27;s fee.

In the 1960s, Wallis also proposed using large cargo submarines to transport oil and other goods, thus avoiding surface weather conditions. Moreover, Wallis&#x27;s calculations indicated, the power requirements for an underwater vessel were lower than for a comparable conventional ship and they could be made to travel at a much higher speed. He also proposed a novel hull structure which would have allowed greater depths to be reached, and the use of gas turbine engines in a submarine, using liquid oxygen. In the end, nothing came of Wallis&#x27;s submarine ideas.

During the 1960s and into his retirement, he developed ideas for an &quot;all-speed&quot; aircraft, capable of efficient flight at all speed ranges from subsonic to hypersonic.

In the late 1950s, Wallis gave a lecture titled &quot;The strength of England&quot; at Eton College, and continued to deliver versions of the talk into the early 1970s, presenting technology and automation as a way to restore Britain&#x27;s dominance. He advocated nuclear-powered cargo submarines as a means of making Britain immune to future embargoes, and to make it a global trading power. He complained of the loss of aircraft design to the United States, and suggested that Britain could dominate air travel by developing a small supersonic airliner capable of short take-off and landing.

== Honours and awards ==
Wallis became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1945, was knighted in 1968, and received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1969.

==Charity work==
Wallis was awarded £10,000 for his war work from the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors. His grief at the loss of so many airmen in the dams raid was such that Wallis donated the entire sum to his alma mater Christ&#x27;s Hospital School in 1951 to allow them to set up the RAF Foundationers&#x27; Trust, assisting the children of RAF personnel killed or injured in action to attend the school. Around this time he also became an almoner of Christ&#x27;s Hospital. When he retired from aeronautical work in 1957, he was appointed Treasurer and Chairman of the Council of Almoners of Christ&#x27;s Hospital, holding the post of Treasurer for nearly 13 years. During this time he oversaw its major reconstruction.

Wallis was an active member of the Royal Air Forces Association, the charity that supports the RAF community.

==Personal life==

In April 1922, Wallis met his cousin-in-law, Molly Bloxam, at a family tea party. She was 17 and he was 34, and her father forbade them from courting. However, he allowed Wallis to assist Molly with her mathematics courses by correspondence, and they wrote some 250 letters, enlivening them with fictional characters such as &quot;Duke Delta X&quot;. The letters gradually became personal, and Wallis proposed marriage on her 20th birthday. They were married on 23 April 1925, and remained so for 54 years until his death in 1979.

For 49 years, from 1930 until his death, Wallis lived with his family in Effingham, Surrey, and he is now buried at the local St. Lawrence Church together with his wife. His epitaph in Latin reads &quot;Spernit Humum Fugiente Penna&quot; (&quot;Severed from the earth with fleeting wing&quot;), a quotation from Horace Ode III.2.

They had four children – Barnes (1926–2008), Mary (1927–2019), Elisabeth (b. 1933) and Christopher (1935–2006) – and also adopted Molly&#x27;s sister&#x27;s children John and Robert McCormick when their parents were killed in an air raid.

His daughter Mary Eyre Wallis later married Harry Stopes-Roe, a son of Marie Stopes. His son Christopher Loudon Wallis was instrumental in the restoration of the watermill and its building on the Stanway Estate near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

Wallis was a vegetarian and an advocate of animal rights. He became a vegetarian at age 73.

==In film and fiction==
In the 1955 film &quot;The Dam Busters&quot;, Wallis was played by Michael Redgrave. Wallis&#x27;s daughter Elisabeth played the camera technician in the water tank sequence.

Wallis and his development of the bouncing bomb are mentioned by Charles Gray in the 1969 film &quot;Mosquito Squadron&quot;.

Wallis appears as a fictionalised character in Stephen Baxter&#x27;s &quot;The Time Ships&quot; (though its birthdate is not the same, 1883 instead of 1887, since he says he was eight when the Time Traveller first used his machine), the authorised sequel to &quot;The Time Machine&quot;. He is portrayed as a British engineer in an alternate history, where the First World War does not end in 1918, and Wallis concentrates his energies on developing a machine for time travel. As a consequence, it is the Germans who develop the bouncing bomb.

His character and the Second World War research lab are featured in the mystery British television series &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot; (Series four, part 2).

In &quot;Scarlet Traces: The Great Game&quot; by Ian Edginton, he is responsible for the development of the Cavorite weapon used to win the war on Mars after the departure of Cavor.

<text>In statistics, the mean squared error (MSE) or mean squared deviation (MSD) of an estimator (of a procedure for estimating an unobserved quantity) measures the average of the squares of the errors—that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the true value. MSE is a risk function, corresponding to the expected value of the squared error loss. The fact that MSE is almost always strictly positive (and not zero) is because of randomness or because the estimator does not account for information that could produce a more accurate estimate. In machine learning, specifically empirical risk minimization, MSE may refer to the &quot;empirical&quot; risk (the average loss on an observed data set), as an estimate of the true MSE (the true risk: the average loss on the actual population distribution).

The MSE is a measure of the quality of an estimator. As it is derived from the square of Euclidean distance, it is always a positive value that decreases as the error approaches zero.

The MSE is the second moment (about the origin) of the error, and thus incorporates both the variance of the estimator (how widely spread the estimates are from one data sample to another) and its bias (how far off the average estimated value is from the true value). For an unbiased estimator, the MSE is the variance of the estimator. Like the variance, MSE has the same units of measurement as the square of the quantity being estimated. In an analogy to standard deviation, taking the square root of MSE yields the &quot;root-mean-square error&quot; or &quot;root-mean-square deviation&quot; (RMSE or RMSD), which has the same units as the quantity being estimated; for an unbiased estimator, the RMSE is the square root of the variance, known as the standard error.

==Definition and basic properties==

The MSE either assesses the quality of a &quot;predictor&quot; (i.e., a function mapping arbitrary inputs to a sample of values of some random variable), or of an &quot;estimator&quot; (i.e., a mathematical function mapping a sample of data to an estimate of a parameter of the population from which the data is sampled). In the context of prediction, understanding the prediction interval can also be useful as it provides a range within which a future observation will fall, with a certain probability. The definition of an MSE differs according to whether one is describing a predictor or an estimator.

===Predictor===

If a vector of formula_1 predictions is generated from a sample of formula_1 data points on all variables, and formula_3 is the vector of observed values of the variable being predicted, with formula_4 being the predicted values (e.g. as from a least-squares fit), then the within-sample MSE of the predictor is computed as

:formula_5

In other words, the MSE is the &quot;mean&quot; formula_6 of the &quot;squares of the errors&quot; formula_7. This is an easily computable quantity for a particular sample (and hence is sample-dependent).

In matrix notation, 
:formula_8
where formula_9 is formula_10 and formula_11 is a formula_12 column vector.

The MSE can also be computed on &quot;q &quot;data points that were not used in estimating the model, either because they were held back for this purpose, or because these data have been newly obtained. Within this process, known as cross-validation, the MSE is often called the test MSE, and is computed as

:formula_13

===Estimator===

The MSE of an estimator formula_14 with respect to an unknown parameter formula_15 is defined as

:formula_16

This definition depends on the unknown parameter, therefore the MSE is a &quot;priori property&quot; of an estimator. The MSE could be a function of unknown parameters, in which case any &quot;estimator&quot; of the MSE based on estimates of these parameters would be a function of the data (and thus a random variable). If the estimator formula_14 is derived as a sample statistic and is used to estimate some population parameter, then the expectation is with respect to the sampling distribution of the sample statistic. 

The MSE can be written as the sum of the variance of the estimator and the squared bias of the estimator, providing a useful way to calculate the MSE and implying that in the case of unbiased estimators, the MSE and variance are equivalent.

:formula_18

====Proof of variance and bias relationship====

formula_19
An even shorter proof can be achieved using the well-known formula that for a random variable formula_20, formula_21. By substituting formula_20 with, formula_23, we haveformula_24But in real modeling case, MSE could be described as the addition of model variance, model bias, and irreducible uncertainty (see Bias–variance tradeoff). According to the relationship, the MSE of the estimators could be simply used for the efficiency comparison, which includes the information of estimator variance and bias. This is called MSE criterion.

==In regression==
In regression analysis, plotting is a more natural way to view the overall trend of the whole data. The mean of the distance from each point to the predicted regression model can be calculated, and shown as the mean squared error. The squaring is critical to reduce the complexity with negative signs. To minimize MSE, the model could be more accurate, which would mean the model is closer to actual data. One example of a linear regression using this method is the least squares method—which evaluates appropriateness of linear regression model to model bivariate dataset, but whose limitation is related to known distribution of the data.

The term &quot;mean squared error&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the unbiased estimate of error variance: the residual sum of squares divided by the number of degrees of freedom. This definition for a known, computed quantity differs from the above definition for the computed MSE of a predictor, in that a different denominator is used. The denominator is the sample size reduced by the number of model parameters estimated from the same data, (&quot;n&quot;−&quot;p&quot;) for &quot;p&quot; regressors or (&quot;n&quot;−&quot;p&quot;−1) if an intercept is used (see errors and residuals in statistics for more details). Although the MSE (as defined in this article) is not an unbiased estimator of the error variance, it is consistent, given the consistency of the predictor.

In regression analysis, &quot;mean squared error&quot;, often referred to as mean squared prediction error or &quot;out-of-sample mean squared error&quot;, can also refer to the mean value of the squared deviations of the predictions from the true values, over an out-of-sample test space, generated by a model estimated over a particular sample space. This also is a known, computed quantity, and it varies by sample and by out-of-sample test space.

In the context of gradient descent algorithms, it is common to introduce a factor of formula_25 to the MSE for ease of computation after taking the derivative. So a value which is technically half the mean of squared errors may be called the MSE.

==Examples==

===Mean===
Suppose we have a random sample of size formula_1 from a population, formula_27. Suppose the sample units were chosen with replacement. That is, the formula_1 units are selected one at a time, and previously selected units are still eligible for selection for all formula_1 draws. The usual estimator for the formula_30 is the sample average

:formula_31

which has an expected value equal to the true mean formula_30 (so it is unbiased) and a mean squared error of

:formula_33

where formula_34 is the population variance.

For a Gaussian distribution, this is the best unbiased estimator (i.e., one with the lowest MSE among all unbiased estimators), but not, say, for a uniform distribution.

===Variance===

The usual estimator for the variance is the &quot;corrected sample variance:&quot;

:formula_35

This is unbiased (its expected value is formula_34), hence also called the &quot;unbiased sample variance,&quot; and its MSE is

:formula_37

where formula_38 is the fourth central moment of the distribution or population, and formula_39 is the excess kurtosis.

However, one can use other estimators for formula_34 which are proportional to formula_41, and an appropriate choice can always give a lower mean squared error. If we define

:formula_42

then we calculate:

:formula_43

This is minimized when

:formula_44

For a Gaussian distribution, where formula_45, this means that the MSE is minimized when dividing the sum by formula_46. The minimum excess kurtosis is formula_47, which is achieved by a Bernoulli distribution with &quot;p&quot; = 1/2 (a coin flip), and the MSE is minimized for formula_48 Hence regardless of the kurtosis, we get a &quot;better&quot; estimate (in the sense of having a lower MSE) by scaling down the unbiased estimator a little bit; this is a simple example of a shrinkage estimator: one &quot;shrinks&quot; the estimator towards zero (scales down the unbiased estimator).

Further, while the corrected sample variance is the best unbiased estimator (minimum mean squared error among unbiased estimators) of variance for Gaussian distributions, if the distribution is not Gaussian, then even among unbiased estimators, the best unbiased estimator of the variance may not be formula_49

===Gaussian distribution===
The following table gives several estimators of the true parameters of the population, μ and σ2, for the Gaussian case.

==Interpretation==

An MSE of zero, meaning that the estimator formula_14 predicts observations of the parameter formula_15 with perfect accuracy, is ideal (but typically not possible).

Values of MSE may be used for comparative purposes. Two or more statistical models may be compared using their MSEs—as a measure of how well they explain a given set of observations: An unbiased estimator (estimated from a statistical model) with the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators is the &quot;best unbiased estimator&quot; or MVUE (Minimum-Variance Unbiased Estimator).

Both analysis of variance and linear regression techniques estimate the MSE as part of the analysis and use the estimated MSE to determine the statistical significance of the factors or predictors under study. The goal of experimental design is to construct experiments in such a way that when the observations are analyzed, the MSE is close to zero relative to the magnitude of at least one of the estimated treatment effects.

In one-way analysis of variance, MSE can be calculated by the division of the sum of squared errors and the degree of freedom. Also, the f-value is the ratio of the mean squared treatment and the MSE.

MSE is also used in several stepwise regression techniques as part of the determination as to how many predictors from a candidate set to include in a model for a given set of observations.

==Applications==

*Minimizing MSE is a key criterion in selecting estimators: see minimum mean-square error. Among unbiased estimators, minimizing the MSE is equivalent to minimizing the variance, and the estimator that does this is the minimum variance unbiased estimator. However, a biased estimator may have lower MSE; see estimator bias.
*In statistical modelling the MSE can represent the difference between the actual observations and the observation values predicted by the model. In this context, it is used to determine the extent to which the model fits the data as well as whether removing some explanatory variables is possible without significantly harming the model&#x27;s predictive ability.
*In forecasting and prediction, the Brier score is a measure of forecast skill based on MSE.

==Loss function==

Squared error loss is one of the most widely used loss functions in statistics, though its widespread use stems more from mathematical convenience than considerations of actual loss in applications. Carl Friedrich Gauss, who introduced the use of mean squared error, was aware of its arbitrariness and was in agreement with objections to it on these grounds. The mathematical benefits of mean squared error are particularly evident in its use at analyzing the performance of linear regression, as it allows one to partition the variation in a dataset into variation explained by the model and variation explained by randomness.

===Criticism===
The use of mean squared error without question has been criticized by the decision theorist James Berger. Mean squared error is the negative of the expected value of one specific utility function, the quadratic utility function, which may not be the appropriate utility function to use under a given set of circumstances. There are, however, some scenarios where mean squared error can serve as a good approximation to a loss function occurring naturally in an application.

Like variance, mean squared error has the disadvantage of heavily weighting outliers. This is a result of the squaring of each term, which effectively weights large errors more heavily than small ones. This property, undesirable in many applications, has led researchers to use alternatives such as the mean absolute error, or those based on the median.

<text>Sir Peter Courtney Quennell (9 March 1905 – 27 October 1993) was an English biographer, literary historian, editor, essayist, poet, and critic. He wrote extensively on social history. In his &quot;Times&quot; obituary he was described as &quot;the last genuine example of the English man of letters&quot;. Anthony Powell called him &quot;The Last of the Mandarins&quot;.

==Life and work==
Born in Bickley, Kent, he was the son of architect C. H. B. Quennell and his wife Marjorie Quennell. After World War I the Quennells wrote a popular series of illustrated children’s books, A History of Everyday Things in England (four volumes, 1918–1934). Peter Quennell was educated at Berkhamsted School (where the headmaster was Graham Greene&#x27;s father) and at Balliol College, Oxford, though he left Oxford before taking a degree. While still at school some of his poems were selected by Richard Hughes for the anthology &quot;Public School Verse&quot;, which brought him to the attention of writers such as Edith Sitwell. At Oxford he forged some lasting literary friendships, including with Robert Graves, and made some enemies (Evelyn Waugh).

In all he published over thirty books and edited thirty-seven more.

===Biography===
In 1922 he published his first book, &quot;Masques and Poems&quot;, and gained further attention when some of his poems were published in the influential Edward Marsh anthology &quot;Georgian Poetry 1920–1922&quot;. But Quennell soon abandoned poetry for prose, and especially biography and non-fiction. His first major book, commissioned by T. S. Eliot, was &quot;Baudelaire and the Symbolists&quot; (1929). Other literary biographies followed, including the &quot;Four Portraits&quot; of 1945 (studies of Boswell, Gibbon, Sterne, and Wilkes), and full length works on Byron (three volumes, 1934, 1935, 1941), Pope (1949), Ruskin (1949), Hogarth (1955), Shakespeare (1963), Proust (1971) and Samuel Johnson (1972).

===Journalism===
He first practised journalism in London and wrote several books and essays on London (for instance, &quot;Casanova in London&quot;, 1971). In 1930 he taught at the University of Tokyo, a somewhat negative experience he turned into a positive through the success of his written account, &quot;A Superficial Journey through Tokyo and Peking&quot; (1932). During the war he took posts within the Ministry of Information and the Auxiliary Fire Service. In 1944–51, he was editor of &quot;The Cornhill Magazine&quot; and from 1951 to 1979 founder-editor of &quot;History Today&quot;, working in partnership with the historian Alan Hodge.

===Autobiography===
Quennell published three volumes of autobiography, &quot;The Sign of the Fish&quot; (1960, his own growth as a writer), &quot;The Marble Foot&quot; (1976, covering the years 1905 to 1938) and &quot;The Wanton Chase: an Autobiography from 1939&quot; (1980). &quot;Customs and Characters&quot; (1982) collected together anecdotes of his friends and contemporaries. He continued to work hard even into his old age, tackling more general subjects in his later work. His final book, &quot;In Pursuit of Happiness&quot; (1988), published when he was 83 years old, was a response to a remark from his father, remembered from childhood: &quot;Well, we&#x27;re not happy are we?&quot;

===Personal life===
He married five times: to Nancy Marianne (1928), Marcelle Marie José (1935), Joyce Frances Glur (1938), Sonia Geraldine Leon (1956, daughter Sarah), and Joan Marilyn Peek (1967, son Alexander). He also had a relationship with the writer Barbara Skelton in the 1940s, sharing a flat with her.

He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), and was knighted in the 1992 New Year Honours. Quennell died in University College Hospital, Camden, London. His funeral was held at St Mark&#x27;s Church, Regent&#x27;s Park.

Quennell&#x27;s first cousin – daughter of his father&#x27;s brother Walter – was Joan Quennell, a Conservative MP.

<text>Viktor Fyodorovich Karpukhin (; October 27, 1947 – March 24, 2003) was a member of the KGB who was instrumental in the Soviet–Afghan War.

He was born in the Ukrainian city of Lutsk. He joined the KGB&#x27;s Alpha Group in 1967 and worked his way up to become its commander in 1988.

On December 23, 1979, Karpukhin led 38 soldiers of the Alpha Group into Afghanistan, who along with 500 Soviet paratroopers, landed at Bagram Airfield, next to the capital Kabul. Two days later, 40,000 Soviet Army soldiers poured over the Afghan border.

Stationed in the Soviet embassy in Kabul, which was close to the Tajbeg Palace of President Hafizullah Amin, Karpukhin&#x27;s forces awaited further instructions. On December 27, Karpukhin was ordered to take the presidential palace. In the attack, two Soviet soldiers were killed, and Amin was shot to death. The following day, Prime Minister Babrak Karmal took Amin&#x27;s seat as president. Karpukhin was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union medal for his role.

Karpukhin retired from the Alpha Group in 1992 and worked in various government and commercial ventures.

<text>In geometry, a trapezoid () in North American English, or trapezium () in British English, is a quadrilateral that has at least one pair of parallel sides.

The parallel sides are called the &quot;bases&quot; of the trapezoid. The other two sides are called the &quot;legs&quot; (or the &quot;lateral sides&quot;) if they are not parallel; otherwise, the trapezoid is a parallelogram, and there are two pairs of bases. A &quot;scalene trapezoid&quot; is a trapezoid with no sides of equal measure, in contrast with the special cases below.

A trapezoid is usually considered to be a convex quadrilateral in Euclidean geometry, but there are also crossed cases. If &quot;ABCD&quot; is a convex trapezoid, then &quot;ABDC&quot; is a crossed trapezoid. The metric formulas in this article apply in convex trapezoids.

==Inclusive versus exclusive definition==
There is some disagreement whether parallelograms, which have two pairs of parallel sides, should be regarded as trapezoids.

Some define a trapezoid as a quadrilateral having &quot;only&quot; one pair of parallel sides (the exclusive definition), thereby excluding parallelograms. Some sources use the term &quot;proper trapezoid&quot; to describe trapezoids under the exclusive definition, analogous to uses of the word &quot;proper&quot; in some other mathematical objects.

Others define a trapezoid as a quadrilateral with &quot;at least&quot; one pair of parallel sides (the inclusive definition), making the parallelogram a special type of trapezoid. The latter definition is consistent with its uses in higher mathematics such as calculus. This article uses the inclusive definition and considers parallelograms as special cases of a trapezoid. This is also advocated in the taxonomy of quadrilaterals.

Under the inclusive definition, all parallelograms (including rhombuses, squares and non-square rectangles) are trapezoids. Rectangles have mirror symmetry on mid-edges; rhombuses have mirror symmetry on vertices, while squares have mirror symmetry on both mid-edges and vertices.

==Etymology and &quot;trapezium&quot; versus &quot;trapezoid&quot;==
The ancient Greek mathematician Euclid defined five types of quadrilateral, of which four had two sets of parallel sides (known in English as square, rectangle, rhombus and rhomboid) and the last did not have two sets of parallel sides – a τραπέζια (&quot;trapezia&quot; literally &#x27;table&#x27;, itself from τετράς (&quot;tetrás&quot;) &#x27;four&#x27; + πέζα (&quot;péza&quot;) &#x27;foot; end, border, edge&#x27;).

Two types of &quot;trapezia&quot; were introduced by Proclus (AD 412 to 485) in his commentary on the first book of Euclid&#x27;s Elements:
* one pair of parallel sides – a &quot;trapezium&quot; (τραπέζιον), divided into isosceles (equal legs) and scalene (unequal) trapezia
* no parallel sides – &quot;trapezoid&quot; (τραπεζοειδή, &quot;trapezoeidé&quot;, literally &#x27;trapezium-like&#x27; (εἶδος means &#x27;resembles&#x27;), in the same way as &quot;cuboid&quot; means &#x27;cube-like&#x27; and &quot;rhomboid&quot; means &#x27;rhombus-like&#x27;)

All other European languages follow Proclus&#x27;s structure as did English until the late 18th century, until an influential mathematical dictionary published by Charles Hutton in 1795 supported without explanation a transposition of the terms. This was reversed in British English in about 1875, but it has been retained in American English to the present.

The following table compares usages, with the most specific definitions at the top to the most general at the bottom.
==Special cases==
A right trapezoid (also called &quot;right-angled trapezoid&quot;) has two adjacent right angles. Right trapezoids are used in the trapezoidal rule for estimating areas under a curve.

An acute trapezoid has two adjacent acute angles on its longer &quot;base&quot; edge.

An obtuse trapezoid on the other hand has one acute and one obtuse angle on each &quot;base&quot;.

An isosceles trapezoid is a trapezoid where the base angles have the same measure. As a consequence the two legs are also of equal length and it has reflection symmetry. This is possible for acute trapezoids or right trapezoids (as rectangles).

A parallelogram is (under the inclusive definition) a trapezoid with two pairs of parallel sides. A parallelogram has central 2-fold rotational symmetry (or point reflection symmetry). It is possible for obtuse trapezoids or right trapezoids (rectangles).

A tangential trapezoid is a trapezoid that has an incircle.

A Saccheri quadrilateral is similar to a trapezoid in the hyperbolic plane, with two adjacent right angles, while it is a rectangle in the Euclidean plane. A Lambert quadrilateral in the hyperbolic plane has 3 right angles.

==Condition of existence==
Four lengths &quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot; can constitute the consecutive sides of a non-parallelogram trapezoid with &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; parallel only when
:formula_1

The quadrilateral is a parallelogram when formula_2, but it is an ex-tangential quadrilateral (which is not a trapezoid) when formula_3.

==Characterizations==
Given a convex quadrilateral, the following properties are equivalent, and each implies that the quadrilateral is a trapezoid:
*It has two adjacent angles that are supplementary, that is, they add up to 180 degrees.
*The angle between a side and a diagonal is equal to the angle between the opposite side and the same diagonal.
*The diagonals cut each other in mutually the same ratio (this ratio is the same as that between the lengths of the parallel sides).
*The diagonals cut the quadrilateral into four triangles of which one opposite pair have equal areas.
*The product of the areas of the two triangles formed by one diagonal equals the product of the areas of the two triangles formed by the other diagonal.
*The areas &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; of some two opposite triangles of the four triangles formed by the diagonals satisfy the equation

::formula_4

:where &quot;K&quot; is the area of the quadrilateral.

*The midpoints of two opposite sides of the trapezoid and the intersection of the diagonals are collinear.
*The angles in the quadrilateral &quot;ABCD&quot; satisfy formula_5
*The cosines of two adjacent angles sum to 0, as do the cosines of the other two angles.
*The cotangents of two adjacent angles sum to 0, as do the cotangents of the other two adjacent angles.
*One bimedian divides the quadrilateral into two quadrilaterals of equal areas.
*Twice the length of the bimedian connecting the midpoints of two opposite sides equals the sum of the lengths of the other sides.

Additionally, the following properties are equivalent, and each implies that opposite sides &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are parallel:
* The consecutive sides &quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot; and the diagonals &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot; satisfy the equation
::formula_6

*The distance &quot;v&quot; between the midpoints of the diagonals satisfies the equation
::formula_7

==Midsegment and height==
The &quot;midsegment&quot; of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the legs. It is parallel to the bases. Its length &quot;m&quot; is equal to the average of the lengths of the bases &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; of the trapezoid,
:formula_8

The midsegment of a trapezoid is one of the two bimedians (the other bimedian divides the trapezoid into equal areas).

The &quot;height&quot; (or altitude) is the perpendicular distance between the bases. In the case that the two bases have different lengths (&quot;a&quot; ≠ &quot;b&quot;), the height of a trapezoid &quot;h&quot; can be determined by the length of its four sides using the formula
:formula_9

where &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot; are the lengths of the legs and formula_10.

==Area==
The area &quot;K&quot; of a trapezoid is given by
:formula_11

where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are the lengths of the parallel sides, &quot;h&quot; is the height (the perpendicular distance between these sides), and &quot;m&quot; is the arithmetic mean of the lengths of the two parallel sides. In 499 AD Aryabhata, a great mathematician-astronomer from the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy, used this method in the &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot; (section 2.8). This yields as a special case the well-known formula for the area of a triangle, by considering a triangle as a degenerate trapezoid in which one of the parallel sides has shrunk to a point.

The 7th-century Indian mathematician Bhāskara I derived the following formula for the area of a trapezoid with consecutive sides &quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;:
:formula_12

where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are parallel and &quot;b&quot; &gt; &quot;a&quot;. This formula can be factored into a more symmetric version
:formula_13

When one of the parallel sides has shrunk to a point (say &quot;a&quot; = 0), this formula reduces to Heron&#x27;s formula for the area of a triangle.

Another equivalent formula for the area, which more closely resembles Heron&#x27;s formula, is
:formula_14

where formula_15 is the semiperimeter of the trapezoid. (This formula is similar to Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula, but it differs from it, in that a trapezoid might not be cyclic (inscribed in a circle). The formula is also a special case of Bretschneider&#x27;s formula for a general quadrilateral).

From Bretschneider&#x27;s formula, it follows that
:formula_16

The bimedian connecting the parallel sides bisects the area.

==Diagonals==

The lengths of the diagonals are
:formula_17
:formula_18

where &quot;a&quot; is the short base, &quot;b&quot; is the long base, and &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot; are the trapezoid legs.

If the trapezoid is divided into four triangles by its diagonals &quot;AC&quot; and &quot;BD&quot; (as shown on the right), intersecting at &quot;O&quot;, then the area of is equal to that of , and the product of the areas of and is equal to that of and . The ratio of the areas of each pair of adjacent triangles is the same as that between the lengths of the parallel sides.

Let the trapezoid have vertices &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot; in sequence and have parallel sides &quot;AB&quot; and &quot;DC&quot;. Let &quot;E&quot; be the intersection of the diagonals, and let &quot;F&quot; be on side &quot;DA&quot; and &quot;G&quot; be on side &quot;BC&quot; such that &quot;FEG&quot; is parallel to &quot;AB&quot; and &quot;CD&quot;. Then &quot;FG&quot; is the harmonic mean of &quot;AB&quot; and &quot;DC&quot;:
:formula_19

The line that goes through both the intersection point of the extended nonparallel sides and the intersection point of the diagonals, bisects each base.

==Other properties==
The center of area (center of mass for a uniform lamina) lies along the line segment joining the midpoints of the parallel sides, at a perpendicular distance &quot;x&quot; from the longer side &quot;b&quot; given by
:formula_20

The center of area divides this segment in the ratio (when taken from the short to the long side)

:formula_21

If the angle bisectors to angles &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; intersect at &quot;P&quot;, and the angle bisectors to angles &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; intersect at &quot;Q&quot;, then
:formula_22

==Applications==
===Architecture===
In architecture the word is used to refer to symmetrical doors, windows, and buildings built wider at the base, tapering toward the top, in Egyptian style. If these have straight sides and sharp angular corners, their shapes are usually isosceles trapezoids. This was the standard style for the doors and windows of the Inca.

===Geometry===
The crossed ladders problem is the problem of finding the distance between the parallel sides of a right trapezoid, given the diagonal lengths and the distance from the perpendicular leg to the diagonal intersection.

===Biology===
In morphology, taxonomy and other descriptive disciplines in which a term for such shapes is necessary, terms such as &quot;trapezoidal&quot; or &quot;trapeziform&quot; commonly are useful in descriptions of particular organs or forms.

===Computer engineering===
In computer engineering, specifically digital logic and computer architecture, trapezoids are typically utilized to symbolize multiplexors. Multiplexors are logic elements that select between multiple elements and produce a single output based on a select signal. Typical designs will employ trapezoids without specifically stating they are multiplexors as they are universally equivalent.
