==Plot==

In 1928 Kansas, teenagers Wilma Dean &quot;Deanie&quot; Loomis and her boyfriend, Bud Stamper, want a more physically intimate relationship, but heed the advice of their parents not to become more involved for the sake of Deanie&#x27;s reputation and Bud&#x27;s future plans for college. Bud&#x27;s sister, Ginny, a flapper, is more worldly, having returned from Chicago after an annulment and rumors of an abortion to the disappointment and shame of her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Ace Stamper. Soon, Bud rescues Ginny from an attempted rape at a New Year&#x27;s Eve party, but disturbed by what he has seen, tells Deanie they should stop fooling around, and they break up.

Bud has a liaison with a friend, Juanita. Shortly afterward, Deanie explodes in anger when her mother asks if she is still a virgin. Allen &quot;Toots&quot; Tuttle takes Deanie to a school dance where she sees Bud, and tries to entice him into having sex. Bud rebuffs her and Deanie runs back to Toots, who drives her to a private spot. While there, Deanie realizes that she can&#x27;t go through with sex, at which point she is almost raped. Escaping from Toots and driven close to madness, she attempts suicide by jumping in the pond, but is rescued just before reaching the waterfalls. Her parents sell their oil stock to pay for her institutionalization, and fortuitously turn a profit prior to the Crash of 1929 that leads to the Great Depression.

While Deanie is in the institution, she meets patient Johnny Masterson, who has anger issues targeted at his parents, who want him to be a surgeon. The two form a bond. Meanwhile, Bud is sent to Yale, where he fails practically all his courses but meets Angelina, the daughter of Italian immigrants who run a local restaurant in New Haven. In October 1929, Bud&#x27;s father Ace travels to New Haven in an attempt to persuade the dean not to expel Bud from school. Bud tells the dean he only aspires to own a ranch. The stock market crashes while Ace is in New Haven, and he loses almost everything. He takes Bud to New York for a weekend, including to a cabaret nightclub, and has a prostitute sent to Bud&#x27;s room; Bud rebuffs her. Ace commits suicide by jumping from a building – something he was joking about a short time earlier.

Deanie returns from the asylum after two years and six months, &quot;almost to the day&quot;. Ace&#x27;s widow has gone to live with relatives, and Bud&#x27;s sister has died in a car crash. Deanie&#x27;s mother wants to shield her from any potential anguish from meeting Bud, so she pretends to not know where he is. When Deanie&#x27;s friends from high school come over, her mother gets them to agree to feign ignorance on Bud&#x27;s whereabouts. However, Deanie&#x27;s father refuses to coddle his daughter and tells her that Bud has taken up ranching and lives on the old family farm. Her friends drive Deanie to meet Bud at an old farmhouse. He is dressed in plain clothes and married to Angelina; they have an infant son named Bud Jr. and another child on the way. Deanie lets Bud know she is going to marry John (who is now a doctor in Cincinnati). During their brief reunion, Deanie and Bud realize that both must accept what life has thrown at them. Bud says, &quot;What&#x27;s the point? You gotta take what comes.&quot; They each relate that they &quot;don&#x27;t think about happiness very much anymore.&quot;

As Deanie leaves with her friends, Bud only seems partially satisfied by the direction his life has taken. After the others are gone, he reassures Angelina, who has realized that Deanie was once the love of his life. Driving away, Deanie&#x27;s friends ask her if she is still in love with Bud. She does not answer them, but her voice is heard reciting four lines from Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;&quot;: 
:&quot;Though nothing can bring back the hour 
:Of splendor in the grass, glory in the flower 
:We will grieve not; rather find 
:Strength in what remains behind.&quot;

==Production==

Filmed in New York City at Filmways Studios, &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot; is based on people whom screenwriter William Inge knew while growing up in Kansas in the 1920s. He told the story to director Elia Kazan when they were working on a production of Inge&#x27;s play &quot;The Dark at the Top of the Stairs&quot; in 1957. They agreed that it would make a good film and that they wanted to work together on it. Inge wrote it first as a novel, then as a screenplay.

The film&#x27;s title is taken from a line of William Wordsworth&#x27;s poem &quot;&quot;:
:What though the radiance which was once so bright
:Be now for ever taken from my sight,
:Though nothing can bring back the hour
:Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;
:We will grieve not, rather find
:Strength in what remains behind...

Two years before writing the screenplay for the film, Inge wrote &quot;Glory in the Flower&quot; (1953), a stage play whose title comes from the same line of the Wordsworth poem. The play relates the story of two middle-aged, former lovers who meet again briefly at a diner after a long estrangement; they are essentially the same characters as Bud and Deanie, though the names are Bus and Jackie.

Scenes of Kansas and the Loomis home were shot in the Travis section of Staten Island, New York City. Exterior scenes of the high school campus were shot at Horace Mann School in the Bronx. The gothic buildings of the North Campus of The City College of New York stand in for Yale University in New Haven. The scenes at the waterfall were shot in High Falls, New York, summer home of director Kazan.

Warren Beatty, while having appeared on television (most notably in a recurring role on &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;), made his screen debut in this film. He had met Inge the year before while appearing in Inge&#x27;s play &quot;A Loss of Roses&quot; on Broadway.

Inge also made his screen debut in the film, as did Sandy Dennis who appeared in a small role as a classmate of Deanie. Marla Adams and Phyllis Diller were others who made their first appearances in this film. Diller&#x27;s role was based on Texas Guinan, a famous actress and restaurateur, who owned the famous 300 Club in New York City in the 20s.

==Reception==

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film a &quot;frank and ferocious social drama that makes the eyes pop and the modest cheek burn&quot;; he had comments on several of the performances:

* Pat Hingle &quot;gives a bruising performance as the oil-wealthy father of the boy, pushing and pounding and preaching, knocking the heart out of the lad&quot;
* Audrey Christie is &quot;relentlessly engulfing as the sticky-sweet mother of the girl&quot;
* Warren Beatty is a &quot;surprising newcomer&quot; and an &quot;amiable, decent, sturdy lad whose emotional exhaustion and defeat are the deep pathos in the film&quot;
* Natalie Wood has a &quot;beauty and radiance that carry her through a role of violent passions and depressions with unsullied purity and strength. There is poetry in her performance, and her eyes in the final scene bespeak the moral significance and emotional fulfillment of this film.&quot;

Writing in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, however, Dwight Macdonald confirmed the notion that Elia Kazan was &quot;as vulgar a director as has come along since Cecil B. De Mille.&quot; He further commented:

As for the performances, &quot;Variety&quot; stated that Wood and Beatty &quot;deliver convincing, appealing performances&quot; and Christie and Hingle were &quot;truly exceptional&quot;, but also found &quot;something awkward about the picture&#x27;s mechanical rhythm. There are missing links and blind alleys within the story. Several times it segues abruptly from a climax to a point much later in time at which is encountered revelations and eventualities the auditor cannot take for granted. Too much time is spent focusing attention on characters of minor significance in themselves.&quot; Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The picture does have its theatrical excesses and falls short idealistically in that its morality remains unresolved; nevertheless, it is film-making of the first order and one of the few significant American dramas we have had this year.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; found &quot;beauty and truth&quot; in the story but thought &quot;the parents&#x27; incessant nagging and unlistening ears are not convincing&quot; and that Christie and Hingle&#x27;s characters &quot;could do all that they do in far less footage.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; awarded a grade of &quot;Very Good&quot; and wrote that the adult themes &quot;do not blow up the story into a soap-opera bubble. The emotional cheapness and the sordid crudeness that are evidencing themselves in so many of the yarns being spun, these days, out of the sexual pattern of young, immoral behavior is not to be found here. Instead, you find a poignantly appealing and warmly touching performance of lovely Natalie Wood that gives the story meaning.&quot; Brendan Gill of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; disagreed and slammed the film for being &quot;as phony a picture as I can remember seeing,&quot; explaining that Inge and Kazan &quot;must know perfectly well that the young people whom they cause to go thrashing about in &#x27;Splendor in the Grass&#x27; bear practically no relation to young people in real life ... one has no choice but to suppose that this unwholesome sally into adolescent sexology was devised neither to instruct our minds nor to move our hearts but to arouse a prurient interest and produce a box-office smasheroo. I can&#x27;t help hoping they have overplayed their hand.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; magazine said &quot;the script, on the whole, is the weakest element of the picture, but scriptwriter Inge can hardly be blamed for it&quot; because it had been &quot;heavily edited&quot; by Kazan; the unidentified reviewer called the film a &quot;relatively simple story of adolescent love and frustration&quot; that has been &quot;jargoned-up and chaptered-out till it sounds like an angry psychosociological monograph describing the sexual mores of the heartless heartland.&quot;

The film holds a score of 74% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 27 reviews.

==Awards and nominations==
* The film ranked No. 50 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s list of the 50 Best High School Movies. In 2002, the American Film Institute ranked &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot; number 47 on its list of the Top 100 Greatest Love Stories of All Time.

==Remake==
&quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot; was re-made as the 1981 television film &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot; with Melissa Gilbert, Cyril O&#x27;Reilly, and Michelle Pfeiffer.

==In popular culture==
The movie&#x27;s story line and main character inspired a hit song by Shaun Cassidy entitled, &quot;Hey Deanie&quot;. It was written by Eric Carmen, who also later recorded the song. Cassidy&#x27;s rendition reached No. 7 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 during the winter of 1978. &quot;Hey Deanie&quot; was the second of two songs directly inspired by the movie, the first being Jackie DeShannon&#x27;s 1966 song, &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot;.

In 1973 Judy Blume published a young adult novel entitled &quot;Deenie&quot;. The first few lines of the book have the central character introduce herself and explain that shortly before she was born her mother saw a movie about a beautiful girl named Wilmadeene whom everybody called Deenie for short, and that the first time that she held her baby daughter she knew the baby would turn out beautiful and so named her Deenie too. Blume&#x27;s Deenie goes on to explain that it took her almost 13 years to find out that the girl in the movie went crazy and &quot;ended up on the funny farm&quot;, and that her mother advised her to forget that part of the story.

In True Detective season 2 episode 7 the movie is featured and watched.

<text>Anne Bancroft (born Anna Maria Louisa Italiano; September 17, 1931 – June 6, 2005) was an American actress. Respected for her acting prowess and versatility, Bancroft received an Academy Award, three BAFTA Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, two Tony Awards, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and a Cannes Film Festival Award. She is one of 24 thespians to achieve the Triple Crown of Acting.

Associated with the method acting technique, having studied under Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio, Bancroft made her film debut in the noir thriller &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother to Knock&quot; in 1952, and appeared in 14 other films over the following five years. In 1958, she made her Broadway debut with the play &quot;Two for the Seesaw&quot;, winning the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play. The next year she portrayed Anne Sullivan in the original Broadway production of &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot;, winning the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. After her continued success on stage, Bancroft&#x27;s film career was revived when she was cast in the acclaimed film adaptation of &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; (1962) for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. Her film career progressed with Oscar nominated performances in &quot;The Pumpkin Eater&quot; (1964), &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967), &quot;The Turning Point&quot; (1977), and &quot;Agnes of God&quot; (1985).

Bancroft continued to act in the later half of her life, with prominent roles including Mary Magdalene in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (1977), &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; (1980), &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; (1983), &quot;Garbo Talks&quot; (1984), &quot;84 Charing Cross Road&quot; (1987), &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot; (1988), &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot; (1995), &quot;G.I.

She died in 2005, at the age of 73, as a result of uterine cancer. She was married to director, actor, and writer Mel Brooks, with whom she had a son, author Max Brooks.

==Early life==
Bancroft was born Anna Maria Luisa Italiano on September 17, 1931 in the Bronx, New York, the middle of three daughters of Mildred Carmela (; 1907–2010), a telephone operator, and Michael Gregory Italiano (1905–2001), a dress pattern maker. Her parents were children of Italian immigrants from Muro Lucano, Basilicata. She grew up Roman Catholic.

Bancroft was raised in Little Italy, in the Belmont neighborhood of the Bronx, attended P.S. 12, later moving to 1580 Zerega Ave. and graduating from Christopher Columbus High School in 1948. She then attended HB Studio, the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, the Actors Studio and the American Film Institute&#x27;s Directing Workshop for Women at the University of California, Los Angeles. After appearing in a number of live television dramas, including &quot;Studio One&quot; and &quot;The Goldbergs&quot; under the name Anne Marno, later, at Darryl Zanuck&#x27;s insistence, she chose the less foreign-sounding surname of Bancroft &quot;because it sounded dignified&quot;.

==Career==

=== 1952–1962: Initial work and breakthrough ===
Bancroft made her screen debut with a major role in the 1952 Marilyn Monroe-led psychological thriller &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother to Knock&quot;. She appeared in 14 films over the next five years, including &quot;Treasure of the Golden Condor&quot; (1953), &quot;Gorilla at Large&quot; (1954), &quot;Demetrius and the Gladiators&quot; (1954), &quot;New York Confidential&quot; (1955) and &quot;Walk the Proud Land&quot; (1956). In 1957, Bancroft was directed by Jacques Tourneur in a David Goodis adaptation, &quot;Nightfall.&quot; In 1958, she made her Broadway debut as lovelorn, Bronx-accented Gittel Mosca opposite Henry Fonda (as the married man Gittel loves) in William Gibson&#x27;s two-character play &quot;Two for the Seesaw&quot;, directed by Arthur Penn. For the role, she won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play. 

Bancroft won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play in 1960, again with playwright Gibson and director Penn, when she played Annie Sullivan, the young woman who teaches the child Helen Keller to communicate in &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot;. She reprised her role in the 1962 film and won the Academy Award for Best Actress, with Patty Duke repeating her own success as Keller alongside Bancroft. As Bancroft had returned to Broadway to star in &quot;Mother Courage and Her Children&quot;, Joan Crawford accepted the Oscar on her behalf and later presented the award to her in New York.

=== 1963–1985: Success, decline and comeback ===
Bancroft co-starred as a medieval nun obsessed with a priest (Jason Robards) in the 1965 Broadway production of John Whiting&#x27;s play &quot;The Devils&quot;. Produced by Alexander H. Cohen and directed by Michael Cacoyannis, it ran for 63 performances.

Bancroft received a second nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in &quot;The Pumpkin Eater&quot; (1964). Bancroft achieved stardom when she played the starring role as Mrs. Robinson in the romantic comedy-drama &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967). In the film, she played an unhappily married woman who seduces the son of her husband&#x27;s business partner, the much younger recent college graduate played by Dustin Hoffman. In the film, Hoffman&#x27;s character later dates and falls in love with her daughter. Bancroft was ambivalent about her appearance in &quot;The Graduate&quot;; she said in several interviews that the role overshadowed her other work. Despite her character becoming an archetype of the &quot;older woman&quot; role, Bancroft was only 36 years old at the time—just eight years older than her onscreen daughter Katharine Ross and six years older than Hoffman. The film, and her performance, received widespread critical acclaim, earning her a third nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. A CBS television special, &quot;Annie: The Women in the Life of a Man&quot; (1970), won Bancroft an Emmy Award for her singing and acting.

Bancroft is one of ten actors to have won both an Academy Award and a Tony Award for the same role (as Annie Sullivan in &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot;), and one of very few entertainers to win an Oscar, an Emmy and a Tony award. This rare achievement is also known as the Triple Crown of Acting. She followed that success with a second television special, &quot;Annie and the Hoods&quot; (1974), which was telecast on ABC and featured her husband Mel Brooks as a guest star. She made an uncredited cameo in the film &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; (1974), directed by Brooks. She made a career comeback with the ballet drama &quot;The Turning Point&quot; (1977), followed by the neo-noir mystery film &quot;Agnes of God&quot; (1985), which earned her two nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress. 

Bancroft made her debut as a screenwriter and director in &quot;Fatso&quot; (1980), in which she starred with Dom DeLuise.

Bancroft was the original choice to play Joan Crawford in the film &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; (1981), but backed out and was replaced by Faye Dunaway. She was also a front-runner for the role of Aurora Greenway in &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; (1983), but declined so that she could act in the remake of &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; (1983) with Brooks. In 1988, she played Harvey Fierstein&#x27;s mother in the film version of his play &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot;.

=== 1986–2005: Final film and television roles ===
During the 1990s and early 2000s, Bancroft took supporting roles in a number of films in which she co-starred with major film stars, including &quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot; (1992), &quot;Love Potion No. 9&quot; (1992), &quot;Malice&quot; (1993), &quot;Point of No Return&quot; (1993), &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot; (1995), &quot;How to Make an American Quilt&quot; (1995), &quot;G.I. Jane&quot; (1997), &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1998), &quot;Keeping the Faith&quot; (2000), &quot;Up at the Villa&quot; (2000) and &quot;Heartbreakers&quot; (2001). She lent her voice to the animated film &quot;Antz&quot; (1998).

Bancroft also starred in several television movies and miniseries, receiving six Emmy Award nominations (winning once for herself and shared for &quot;Annie, The Women in the Life of a Man&quot;), eight Golden Globe nominations (winning twice) and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. Her last appearance was as herself in a 2004 episode of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. She was cast in &quot;Spanglish&quot; (2004) later in the year, but had to bow out due to a medical emergency. Her last project was the animated feature film &quot;Delgo&quot;, released posthumously in 2008. The film was dedicated to her.

Bancroft received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6368 Hollywood Boulevard for her work in television. At the time of her star&#x27;s installation in 1960, she had recently appeared in several TV series. She was also a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame, having been inducted in 1992.

==Personal life==

Bancroft&#x27;s first husband was lawyer Martin May, of Lubbock, Texas. They married on July 1, 1953, separated in November 1955, and divorced on February 13, 1957. She had previously been engaged to actor John Ericson in 1951. Lee Marvin&#x27;s ex-wife Betty claimed in her 2010 book &quot;Tales of a Hollywood Housewife&quot; that Marvin had an affair with Bancroft when they co-starred in &quot;Gorilla at Large&quot; (1954) and &quot;A Life in the Balance&quot; (1955).

In 1961, Bancroft met Mel Brooks at a rehearsal for Perry Como&#x27;s variety show &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot;. Bancroft and Brooks married on August 5, 1964, at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau near New York City Hall, and were married until her death in 2005. Their son, Max Brooks, was born in 1972. Bancroft worked with her husband three times on the screen: dancing a tango in Brooks&#x27;s &quot;Silent Movie&quot; (1976), in his remake of &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; (1983) and in the episode titled &quot;Opening Night&quot; (2004) of the HBO show &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. The couple also appeared in &quot;&quot; (1995), but never appeared together again. Brooks produced the film &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; (1980), in which Bancroft acted. He was executive producer for the film &quot;84 Charing Cross Road&quot; (1987) in which she starred. Both Brooks and Bancroft appeared in Season 6 of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. According to the DVD commentary, when Bancroft came to record her lines for the episode &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;, the &quot;Simpsons&quot; writers asked if Brooks had come with her (which he had); she joked, &quot;I can&#x27;t get rid of him!&quot;

In a 2010 interview, Brooks credited Bancroft as being the guiding force behind his involvement in developing &quot;The Producers&quot; and &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; for the musical theater. In the same interview, he said of their first meeting in 1961, &quot;From that day, until her death on June 6, 2005, we were glued together.&quot; Bancroft&#x27;s son, Max, said in a 2020 interview that she was &quot;a secret, closet scientist&quot;. He said that, as a child, she read to him Paul de Kruif&#x27;s &quot;Microbe Hunters&quot; (1926) as a bedtime story.

In 2005, shortly before her death, Bancroft became a grandmother when her daughter-in-law Michelle had a boy, Henry Michael Brooks. Bancroft had a drinking problem which resulted in being absent from work often, according to Elizabeth Wilson, who was Bancroft&#x27;s understudy in &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; and co-starred with her in &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Prisoner of Second Avenue&quot; (1975).

==Death==
Bancroft died of uterine cancer at age 73 on June 6, 2005, at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. Her death surprised many, including some of her friends, as the intensely private Bancroft had not disclosed any details of her illness. Her body was interred at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York, near her father; her mother would die five years after Bancroft in April 2010 and be buried with her family. Her final film, &quot;Delgo&quot;, was dedicated to her memory.

<text>Karl-Birger Blomdahl (19 October 1916 – 14 June 1968) was a Swedish composer and conductor born in Växjö. He was educated in biochemistry, but was primarily active in music and by his experimental compositions he became one of the big names in Swedish modernism. His teachers included Hilding Rosenberg. He died in Kungsängen, Stockholm.

His third symphony, &quot;Facettes&quot; – a work in one subdivided movement as a twelve-tone variation-form piece – from 1950 is a major contribution to the repertoire. In 1959 he composed the opera &quot;Aniara&quot; based on the poem by Harry Martinson. His output of compositions also includes concertos for violin and viola, a chamber concerto for piano, winds and percussion, at least one other opera (&quot;Herr von Hancken&quot;), and much chamber music, including a trio for clarinet, cello and piano.

<text>The Miracle Worker refers to a broadcast, a play and various other adaptations of Helen Keller&#x27;s 1903 autobiography &quot;The Story of My Life&quot;. The first of these works was a 1957 &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; broadcast written by William Gibson and starring Teresa Wright as Anne Sullivan and Patricia McCormack as Keller. Gibson adapted his teleplay for a 1959 Broadway production with Patty Duke as Keller and Anne Bancroft as Sullivan. The 1962 film also starred Bancroft and Duke. Subsequent television films were released in 1979 and in 2000.

==Source of the name==
The title originates in Mark Twain&#x27;s description of Sullivan as a &quot;miracle worker&quot;. He admired both women, and although his personal finances were problematic, he helped arrange the funding of Keller&#x27;s Radcliffe College education by his friend, financier and industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers.

<doc id="206731" wikidata="Q618430" url="?curid=206731" title="Long Day's Journey into Night">
<text>Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night is a play in four acts written by American playwright Eugene O&#x27;Neill in 1939–1941 and first published posthumously in 1956. It is widely regarded as his magnum opus and one of the great American plays of the 20th century. It premiered in Sweden in February 1956 and then opened on Broadway in November 1956, winning the Tony Award for Best Play. O&#x27;Neill received the 1957 Pulitzer Prize for Drama posthumously for &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot;. The work is openly autobiographical in nature. The &quot;long day&quot; in the title refers to the setting of the play, which takes place during one day.

&quot;A Moon for the Misbegotten&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Journey.&quot;

==Summary==
The play takes place on a single day in August 1912. The setting is Monte Cristo Cottage, the seaside home of the Tyrones in Connecticut. The four main characters are the semi-autobiographical representations of O&#x27;Neill, his older brother, and their parents.

The play portrays a family struggling to grapple with the realities and consequences of each member&#x27;s failings. The parents and two sons blame and resent each other for various reasons; bitterness and jealousy serve as proxies for ultimately failed attempts at tenderness and compassion. The family&#x27;s enduring emotional and psychological stress is fueled by their shared self-analysis, combined with articulate honesty. The story deals with addiction, unfulfilled dreams, moral flaws, and the struggle of family relationships.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
:&quot;Living-room of the Tyrones&#x27; summer home, 8:30 am on a day in August, 1912&quot;
James Tyrone is a 65-year-old actor who had long ago bought a &quot;vehicle&quot; play for himself and had established his reputation based on this one role in which he had toured for years. Although that &quot;vehicle&quot; had served him well financially, he is now resentful that his having become so identified with this character has limited his scope and opportunities as a classical actor. He is a wealthy but somewhat miserly man. His money is all tied up in property, which he hangs onto despite impending financial hardship. His dress and appearance are showing signs of his strained financial circumstances, but he retains many of the mixed affectations of a classical actor in spite of his shabby attire.

His wife Mary recently returned from treatment for morphine addiction and has put on some much-needed weight as a result. (Mary&#x27;s troubles are alluded to, but not made clear until much later in the play.) She is looking much healthier than the family has been accustomed to, and they remark frequently on her improved appearance. However, she still retains the haggard facial features of a long-time addict. As a recovering addict, she is restless and anxious. She also suffers from insomnia. When Edmund, her younger son, hears her moving around at night and entering the spare bedroom, he becomes alarmed, thinking she is succumbing to her addiction. He questions her about it indirectly, but she reassures him that she just wanted to get away from her husband&#x27;s snoring.

In addition to Mary&#x27;s problems, the family is burdened by Edmund&#x27;s coughing; they fear that he might have tuberculosis, and are anxiously awaiting a doctor&#x27;s diagnosis. Edmund is more concerned about the effect a positive diagnosis might have on his mother than on himself. The constant possibility that she might relapse worries him still further.

===Act II===
:&quot;The same, around 12:45 pm; and about a half-hour later&quot;
Jamie and Edmund taunt each other about stealing their father&#x27;s alcohol and watering it down so he won&#x27;t notice. They speak about Mary&#x27;s conduct. Jamie berates Edmund for leaving their mother unsupervised. Edmund berates Jamie for being suspicious. Both, however, are deeply worried that their mother&#x27;s addiction may have resurfaced. Jamie points out to Edmund that they had concealed their mother&#x27;s addiction from him for ten years, explaining that his naiveté about the nature of the disease was understandable but deluded. They discuss the upcoming results of Edmund&#x27;s tests for tuberculosis, and Jamie tells him to prepare for the worst.

Mary appears. She is distraught about Edmund&#x27;s coughing, which he tries to suppress so as not to alarm her, fearing anything that might trigger her addiction again. When Edmund accepts his mother&#x27;s excuse that she had been upstairs so long because she had been &quot;lying down&quot;, Jamie looks at them both contemptuously. Mary notices and starts becoming defensive and belligerent, berating Jamie for his cynicism and disrespect for his parents. Jamie is quick to point out that the only reason he has survived as an actor is through his father&#x27;s influence in the business.

Mary speaks of her frustration with their summer home, its impermanence and shabbiness, and her husband&#x27;s indifference to his surroundings. With irony, she alludes to her belief that this air of detachment might be the very reason he has tolerated her addiction for so long. Finally, unable to tolerate the way Jamie is looking at her, Mary asks him angrily why he is doing it. &quot;You know!&quot;, he retorts, and tells her to take a look at her glazed eyes in the mirror.

===Act III===
:&quot;The same, around 6:30 that evening&quot;
Mary and Cathleen return home from their drive to the drugstore, where Mary has sent Cathleen in to purchase her morphine prescription. Not wanting to be alone, Mary does not allow Cathleen to go to the kitchen to finish dinner and offers her a drink instead. Mary does most of the talking and discusses her love for fog but her hatred of the foghorn, and her husband&#x27;s obvious obsession with money. Mary already took some of her &quot;prescription.&quot; She talks about her past in a Catholic convent, the promise she had as a pianist, and plans for becoming a nun. She also makes it clear that, while she fell in love with her husband upon meeting him, she had never taken to the theatre crowd. She shows her arthritic hands to Cathleen and explains that the pain is why she needs drugs – an explanation which is untrue and transparent to Cathleen.

When Mary dozes off, Cathleen exits to prepare dinner. Mary awakes and begins to have haunting memories about life before marriage. She decides that her prayers as an addict are not being heard by the Virgin Mary and decides to go upstairs to get more drugs. Before she can do so, Edmund and James Sr. return home.

The men are drunk, but they realize that Mary is back on morphine. Jamie has not returned home, but has elected instead to continue drinking and to visit prostitutes. After calling Jamie a &quot;hopeless failure&quot;, Mary warns that his bad influence will drag his brother down as well. After seeing the condition that his wife is in, James expresses the regret that he bothered to come home, and he attempts to ignore her as she continues her remarks, which include blaming him for Jamie&#x27;s drinking. Then, as often happens in the play, Mary and James try to get over their animosity and attempt to express their love for one another by remembering happier days. When James goes to the basement to get another bottle of whiskey, Mary continues to talk with Edmund.

When Edmund reveals that he has consumption (tuberculosis), Mary refuses to believe it, and attempts to discredit Dr. Hardy, due to her inability to face the reality and severity of the situation. She accuses Edmund of attempting to get more attention by blowing everything out of proportion. In retaliation, Edmund reminds his mother that her own father died of consumption, and then, before exiting, he adds how difficult it is to have a &quot;dope fiend for a mother.&quot; Alone, Mary admits that she needs more morphine and hopes that someday she will &quot;accidentally&quot; overdose, because she knows that if she did so on purpose, the Virgin never would forgive her. When James comes back with more alcohol he notes that there was evidence that Jamie had attempted to pick the locks to the whiskey cabinet in the cellar, as he has done before. Mary ignores this and bursts out that she is afraid that Edmund is going to die. She also confides to James that Edmund does not love her because of her drug problem. When James attempts to console her, Mary again rues having given birth to Edmund, who appears to have been conceived to replace a baby they had lost before Edmund&#x27;s birth. When Cathleen announces dinner, Mary indicates that she is not hungry and is going to bed. James goes in to dinner all alone, knowing that Mary is really going upstairs to get more drugs.

===Act IV===
:&quot;The same, around midnight&quot;
Edmund returns home to find his father playing solitaire. While the two argue and drink, they also have an intimate, tender conversation. James explains his stinginess, and also reveals that he ruined his career by staying in an acting job for money. After so many years playing the same part, he lost his talent for versatility. Edmund talks to his father about sailing and of his failure to become a poet. They hear Jamie coming home drunk, and James leaves to avoid fighting. Jamie and Edmund converse, and Jamie confesses that although he loves Edmund more than anyone else, he wants him to fail. Jamie passes out. When James returns, Jamie wakes up, and they quarrel anew. Mary, lost in her drug-laden dreams of the past, comes downstairs. Holding her wedding gown, she talks about her convent days and how she lost her vocation by falling in love with James, while her husband and sons silently watch her.

==Cast and characters==
* James Tyrone Sr. – 65 years old. He looks ten years younger and is about five feet eight inches tall but appears taller due to his military-like posture and bearing. He is broad-shouldered and deep-chested and remarkably good-looking for his age with light brown eyes. His speech and movement are those of a classical actor with a studied technique, but he is unpretentious and not temperamental at all with &quot;inclinations still close to his humble beginnings and Irish farmer forebears&quot;. His attire is somewhat threadbare and shabby. He wears his clothing to the limit of usefulness. He has been a healthy man his entire life and is free of hang ups and anxieties except for fear of &quot;dying in the poorhouse&quot; and obsession with having money. He has &quot;streaks of sentimental melancholy and rare flashes of intuitive sensibility&quot;. He smokes cigars and dislikes being referred to as the &quot;Old Man&quot; by his sons.
* Mary Cavan Tyrone – 54 years old, the wife and mother of the family who lapses between self-delusion and the haze of her morphine addiction. She is medium height with a young graceful figure, a trifle plump with distinctly Irish facial features. She was once extremely pretty and is still striking. She wears no make-up and her hair is thick, white and perfectly coiffed. She has large, dark, almost black, eyes. She has a soft and attractive voice with a &quot;touch of Irish lilt when she is merry&quot;. Mary has been addicted to morphine since the difficult birth of her youngest son Edmund. The doctor who treated her simply gave her painkillers, which led to a longtime morphine addiction that continues to plague her.
* James &quot;Jamie&quot; Jr. – 33 years old, the older son. He has thinning hair, an aquiline nose and shows signs of premature disintegration. He has a habitual expression of cynicism. He resembles his father. &quot;On the rare occasions when he smiles without sneering, his personality possesses the remnant of a humorous, romantic, irresponsible Irish charm – the beguiling ne&#x27;er-do-well, with a strain of the sentimentally poetic&quot;. He is attractive to women and popular with men. He is an actor like his father but has difficulty finding work due to a reputation for being an irresponsible, womanizing alcoholic. He and his father argue a great deal about this. Jamie often refers to his father as &quot;Old Gaspard&quot;, a character from the opera &quot;Les cloches de Corneville&quot;, who is also a miser.
* Edmund – 23 years old, the younger and more intellectually and poetically inclined son. He is thin and wiry. He looks like both his parents but more like his mother. He has her big dark eyes and hypersensitive mouth in a long narrow Irish face with dark brown hair and red highlights from the sun. Like his mother, he is extremely nervous. He is in bad health and his cheeks are sunken. Later he is diagnosed with tuberculosis. He is politically inclined to have socialist leanings. He traveled the world by working in the merchant navy and caught tuberculosis while abroad.
* Cathleen – &quot;The second girl&quot;, she is the summer maid. She is a &quot;buxom Irish peasant&quot;, in her early twenties with red cheeks, black hair and blue eyes. She is &quot;amiable, ignorant, clumsy with a well-meaning stupidity&quot;.

Several characters are referenced in the play but do not appear on stage:

* Eugene Tyrone – A son born before Edmund who died of measles at the age of two. He was infected by Jamie who was seven at the time and had been told not to enter his room but disobeyed. Mary believes that Jamie had the intent of hurting Eugene.
* Bridget – A cook.
* McGuire – A real estate agent who has swindled James Tyrone in the past.
* Shaughnessy – A tenant on a farm owned by the Tyrones.
* Harker – A friend of James Tyrone, &quot;the Standard Oil millionaire&quot;, owns a neighboring farm to Shaughnessy with whom he gets into conflicts, often postulated to be based on Edward Harkness, Standard Oil heir, who had a summer home nearby in Waterford, Connecticut.
* Doctor Hardy – The Tyrones&#x27; physician at the insistence of James, though the other family members don&#x27;t think much of him and suspect he is only their doctor because he is cheap.
* Captain Turner – The Tyrones&#x27; neighbor.
* Smythe – A garage assistant whom James hired as a chauffeur for Mary. Mary suspects he is intentionally damaging the car to provide work for the garage.
* The mistress – A woman with whom James had had an affair before his marriage, who had later sued him causing Mary to be shunned by her friends as someone with undesirable social connections.
* Mary&#x27;s father – Died of tuberculosis.
* James&#x27;s parents and siblings – The family immigrated to the United States when James was 8 years old. His father abandoned the family two years later and returned to Ireland, where he died after ingesting rat poison. It was suspected suicide but James refuses to believe that. He had two older brothers and three sisters.

==History of the play==
O&#x27;Neill finished revising the manuscript into its final version in March 1941. He did not want it ever produced as a play, and did not even want it published during his lifetime, writing to his friend, the critic George Jean Nathan: &quot;There are good reasons in the play itself...why I&#x27;m keeping this one very much to myself, as you will appreciate when you read it.&quot;

O&#x27;Neill did not copyright the play. In 1945 he had a sealed copy of the manuscript placed in the document vault of publisher Random House, instructing that it not be published until 25 years after his death. He sent a second sealed copy to the O&#x27;Neill collection at Yale University.

Soon after O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s death, his widow Carlotta Monterey demanded that Random House contravene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s explicit wishes and publish the play at once. &quot;We refused, of course,&quot; wrote publisher Bennett Cerf in his memoirs, &quot;but then were horrified to learn that legally all the cards were in her hand. … I do not regret that we took the stand we did, because I still think we were right.&quot; Monterey had the play published by the Yale University Press in 1956, with the bulk of the proceeds deeded to Yale&#x27;s Eugene O&#x27;Neill Collection and for scholarships at its drama school.

==Autobiographical content==
In key aspects, the play closely parallels Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s own life. The location, a summer home in Connecticut, corresponds to the family home Monte Cristo Cottage, in New London, Connecticut (the small town of the play). The actual cottage, today owned and operated by the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center, is made up as it may appear in the play. The family in the script corresponds to the O&#x27;Neill family, which was Irish-American, with three name changes. The family name &quot;O&#x27;Neill&quot; is changed to &quot;Tyrone&quot;, which is the name of the earldom granted to Conn O&#x27;Neill by Henry VIII. The names of the second and third sons are reversed, &quot;Eugene&quot; with &quot;Edmund&quot;. In fact, Eugene, the playwright, was the third and the youngest child, and he corresponds to the character of &quot;Edmund&quot; in the play. O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s mother, Mary Ellen &quot;Ella&quot; Quinlan, corresponds to the character Mary &quot;Cavan.&quot; The ages are all the actual ages of the O&#x27;Neill family in August 1912.

Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s father, James O&#x27;Neill, was a promising actor in his youth, as was the father in the play. He also shared the stage with Edwin Booth, who is mentioned in the play. James O&#x27;Neill achieved commercial success in the title role of Dumas&#x27; &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, playing the title role about 6,000 times, but he was criticized for &quot;selling out&quot; for commercial success at the expense of artistic merit.

Eugene&#x27;s mother Mary did attend Saint Mary&#x27;s College, a Catholic school in the Midwest, in Notre Dame, Indiana. Subsequent to the date when the play is set (1912), but prior to the play&#x27;s writing (1941–42), Eugene&#x27;s older brother Jamie did drink himself to death (c. 1923).

Regarding O&#x27;Neill himself, by 1912 he had attended a renowned university (Princeton), spent several years at sea, and suffered from depression and alcoholism. He did contribute poetry to the local newspaper, the &quot;New London Telegraph&quot;, as well as reporting, and he was admitted to a sanatorium in 1912–13, suffering from tuberculosis (consumption), whereupon he devoted himself to playwriting. Thus, the events in the play are set immediately prior to O&#x27;Neill beginning his career in earnest.

==Productions==

===Premiere productions===

&quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; was first performed on February 2, 1956, by the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm.

It was directed by Bengt Ekerot, with the cast of Lars Hanson (James Tyrone), Inga Tidblad (Mary Tyrone), Ulf Palme (James Tyrone Jr.), Jarl Kulle (Edmund Tyrone) and Catrin Westerlund (Cathleen, the serving-maid). The production was universally praised by the critics.

The Broadway debut of &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; took place at the Helen Hayes Theatre on 7 November 1956, shortly after its American premiere at Boston&#x27;s Wilbur Theatre.

The play&#x27;s first production in the United Kingdom came in 1958, opening first in Edinburgh, Scotland, and then moving to the Globe Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. It was directed again by Quintero, and the cast included Anthony Quayle (James), Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies (Mary), Ian Bannen (Jamie), Alan Bates (Edmund), and Etain O&#x27;Dell (Cathleen).

The play was made into a 1962 film starring Katharine Hepburn as Mary, Ralph Richardson as James, Jason Robards as Jamie, Dean Stockwell as Edmund, and Jeanne Barr as Cathleen. The movie was directed by Sidney Lumet. At that year&#x27;s Cannes Film Festival, Richardson, Robards and Stockwell all received Best Actor awards, and Hepburn was named Best Actress. Hepburn also earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

In 1973, the ITV Sunday Night Theatre program on British television presented a videotaped television version of the 1971 production at the National Theatre directed by Peter Wood and starring Laurence Olivier, Constance Cummings, Denis Quilley, and Ronald Pickup. Olivier won a Best Actor Emmy Award for this performance.

A 1982 TV film directed by William Woodman was produced by ABC featuring an all-African American cast of Earle Hyman (James), Ruby Dee (Mary), Thommie Blackwell (Jamie), and Peter Francis James (Edmund).

A 1987 TV film directed by Jonathan Miller starred Kevin Spacey as Jamie, Peter Gallagher as Edmund, Jack Lemmon as James Tyrone, Bethel Leslie as Mary, and Jodie Lynne McClintock as Cathleen. Lemmon was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in Mini-Series or Made-for-TV Movie the following year.

A 1996 film adaptation was directed by Canadian director David Wellington and starred William Hutt as James, Martha Henry as Mary, Peter Donaldson as Jamie, Tom McCamus as Edmund and Martha Burns as Cathleen. The same cast had previously performed the play at Canada&#x27;s Stratford Festival; Wellington essentially filmed the stage production without significant changes. The film swept the acting awards at the 17th Genie Awards, winning awards for Hutt, Henry, Donaldson and Burns. This version later was aired by PBS on its &quot;Great Performances&quot; series in 1999.

A new film adaptation was filmed in 2022, directed by Jonathan Kent (in his feature directorial debut) and starring Jessica Lange (reprising her role from the 2016 Broadway revival), Ed Harris, Ben Foster, and Colin Morgan. The film has yet to be released.

<doc id="206733" wikidata="Q1511153" url="?curid=206733" title="Sweet Bird of Youth">
<text>Sweet Bird of Youth is a 1959 play by Tennessee Williams that tells the story of a gigolo and drifter, Chance Wayne, who returns to his hometown as the companion of a faded movie star, Alexandra del Lago (travelling incognito as Princess Kosmonopolis), whom he hopes to use to help him break into the movies. The main reason for his homecoming is to get back what he had in his youth, primarily, his old girlfriend, whose father had run him out of town years before. The play was written for Tallulah Bankhead, a good friend of Williams.

&quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; originated around 1956 as two plays: a two-character version of the final play featuring only Chance and the Princess, and a one-act play titled The Pink Bedroom that was later developed into Act Two of the play, featuring Boss Finley and his family.

== Plot ==
In St. Cloud, native son Chance Wayne has fled his hometown, seeking to profit from his beauty and youth in New York or Hollywood. When he fails as an actor and a personality in both cities, he becomes a gigolo. As the traveling escort of his employer, Chance returns to St. Cloud to win back his childhood lover, escorting an aging, depressed, semi-alcoholic film star: Alexandra del Lago, who is running away from the negative criticism of her recently released comeback film.

Del Lago had been burying herself in sex, alcohol, and drugs until Chance recognized her while hustling in a Florida resort. He saw in her a last chance to build a relationship (taking care of her while on their drive back to Hollywood, with him as her escort). As he and del Lago are driving along the Sunset Route back to California, Chance hopes that he will reunite with Heavenly Finley, his childhood sweetheart, and bring her back to Hollywood, where – with del Lago&#x27;s aid – they will both achieve stardom.

Once back in St. Cloud, Chance discovers Heavenly is only a shadow of the girl he knew. During his last visit to St. Cloud, she became pregnant. When she discovered the problem, she had to have an abortion and because of an unskilled doctor&#x27;s knife, the abortion resulted in a hysterectomy and her sterility. Her father and brother are determined to make Chance pay for the injury done to Heavenly. Chance worries that he will receive the same fate as a Black man in town who was recently attacked and castrated.

Using Alexandra&#x27;s car and funds, Chance tries to prove to the town that he is a success, but his old friends call his bluff and see him for what he has become. Meanwhile, del Lago receives news that the criticism she has been running from is actually praise and that her comeback could not have gone better. Chance believes he will ride with her to the top, but she now has no interest helping him start an acting career. With his youth gone, Chance does not know how to move on with his life. Although she will not recommend him for a job in Hollywood, del Lago urges him to continue as her escort, but he decides to stay and accept his punishment in St. Cloud.

== Production history ==

=== Pre-Broadway ===
Williams began work on the play in the fall of 1959, calling it at first &quot;The Enemy of Time&quot;.
As &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot;, the work-in-progress had a tryout production starring Tallulah Bankhead and Robert Drivas in Coral Gables, Florida, directed by George Keathley at his Studio M Playhouse in 1956 which began before Williams&#x27; agent Audrey Wood knew he had a new play. Elia Kazan saw it. Kazan and Cheryl Crawford were &quot;party to the secret and petitioned Audrey to let them produce and direct the new play.&quot;

=== Broadway ===
The original production by Cheryl Crawford opened on March 10, 1959, at the Martin Beck Theatre in New York City. Directed by Elia Kazan, it starred Paul Newman, Geraldine Page, Sidney Blackmer, Madeleine Sherwood, Diana Hyland, Logan Ramsey, and Rip Torn. Bruce Dern also played a small role. The production was nominated for three Tony Awards, including Best Actress for Page. The play ran for more than a year and 375 performances.

A revival opened on December 29, 1975, at the Harkness Theatre, in a production directed by Edwin Sherin, starring Christopher Walken as Chance Wayne and Irene Worth as Princess Kosmonopolis. Worth won the 1976 Tony Award for Best Actress.

A production was planned to open in 2011 with David Cromer directing and Scott Rudin serving as producer. In 2012, the production showed at the Goodman Theatre to much acclaim, with Diane Lane in the lead role.

=== London ===
After 26 years, &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; appeared in London&#x27;s West End. It opened on July 8, 1985, at the Haymarket Theatre in a production directed by Harold Pinter and presented by impresario Douglas Urbanski; it starred Lauren Bacall and Michael Beck with James Grout and David Cunningham. This production later transferred to Los Angeles under the direction of Michael Blakemore.

The play returned to the London stage on 1 June 2013 with a production at The Old Vic directed by Marianne Elliott and starring Kim Cattrall as Del Lago and Seth Numrich as Chance.

=== Chichester ===
The play was revived in 2017 at Chichester Festival Theatre, running from June 2 to 24. Directed by Jonathan Kent, it starred Marcia Gay Harden as Alexandra del Lago/The Princess Kosmonopolis and Brian J. Smith as Chance Wayne. Co-stars included Emma Amos and Richard Cordery.

==Film adaptations==
===1962 feature film===

In 1962, the play was made into a feature film starring Paul Newman, Geraldine Page, Shirley Knight, Madeleine Sherwood, Ed Begley, Rip Torn and Mildred Dunnock. The movie was adapted and directed by Richard Brooks. The film version earned three Academy Award nominations, all for acting: Geraldine Page for Best Actress, Shirley Knight for Best Supporting Actress, and Ed Begley for Best Supporting Actor, which he won.
===1989 television film===

&quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; was made for television in 1989, directed by Nicolas Roeg and starring Elizabeth Taylor, Mark Harmon, Valerie Perrine, Ronnie Claire Edwards, Cheryl Paris, Kevin Geer and Rip Torn. It was adapted by Gavin Lambert.

== In popular culture ==
* In the Robert Zemeckis film &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; (1992), lead character Madeline Ashton (played by Meryl Streep) is depicted as the star of a failing Broadway musical adaptation of &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; titled &quot;Songbird!&quot;.
* The song &quot;Sweet Bird of Truth&quot; by the rock group The The is a reference to the Tennessee Williams play.

<text>The flag of the U.S. state of Georgia bears three horizontal stripes (a red-white-red triband) and features a blue canton containing a ring of 13 white stars that encircle the state&#x27;s gold-colored coat of arms. The ring of stars that encompass the state&#x27;s coat of arms represents Georgia as one of the original Thirteen Colonies. Its current iteration was adopted on February 19, 2003.
The arch symbolizes the state&#x27;s constitution while the pillars represent the three branches of government. The words of the state motto, &quot;Wisdom, Justice, and Moderation&quot;, are wrapped around the pillars, guarded by a figure dressed in colonial attire from the American Revolutionary War. Within the arms, a sword is drawn to represent the defense of the state&#x27;s constitution with the motto of the United States, &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, featured below these elements.

The overall design is based on the First National Flag of the Confederacy, which was nicknamed the &quot;Stars and Bars&quot;. Since Mississippi&#x27;s vote to change their flag design in 2020, the Georgia flag remains one of the few state flags with references to the Confederacy. It is one of three U.S. state flags to include the United States national motto, &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, the other two being those of Florida and Mississippi.

== Origins ==
Georgia had no official state flag until 1879. With the state&#x27;s secession from the Union on January 19, 1861, several different banners were spoken of as the state&#x27;s flag. One of these was the so-called &quot;Bonnie Blue Flag,&quot; which displayed a single white star on a deep blue background. Another was the flag raised over the Savannah Custom House on February 1. It was described in a local newspaper as follows:
The flag is white, bordered with red. In the centre of the white field is represented the Coat of Arms of Georgia. Five red stars, with the blue star of Georgia at the top of the temple, and surrounded with a glory from the curve of the arch extending from the two lower corners of the flag. Over all is the All-seeing Eye. By this arrangement, while the coat of arms of our own State is the prominent feature of the banner, the seceding States, as they may come into the constellation of our Southern Confederacy, will find their appropriate places in the arch of strength or the bow of promise that spans our glorious banner of free and independent Georgia. 

The Georgia Code of 1861 required that militia regiments and battalions detailed for service outside of Georgia be provided with regimental colors &quot;bearing the arms of the State&quot;. Regimental colors were to be inscribed with name of the unit. The color of the flag itself was not specified. A surviving state flag in the collection of the American Civil War Museum in Richmond, however, places the arms on a red field.

== History ==
=== First official flag (1879–1956) ===

The 1879 flag was introduced by Georgia state senator Herman H. Perry and was adopted to memorialize Confederate soldiers during the American Civil War. Perry was a former colonel in the during the war, and he presumably based the design on the First National Flag of the Confederacy, commonly known as the Stars and Bars. Over the years the flag was changed by adding and altering a charge on the vertical blue band at the hoist. The original 1879 design featured a solid blue band with no additional emblems.

A 1902 amendment to the state militia laws added the state&#x27;s coat of arms to the blue band, though a 2000 research report by the Georgia Senate states that researchers were not aware of any surviving flags depicting the coat of arms directly on the blue band, suggesting that no such flag was ever actually produced. Instead, no later than 1904, the coat of arms began to be depicted on a white shield, possibly with a gold outline. This version also added a red ribbon with the word &quot;GEORGIA&quot; below the shield. Examples of this modified version were discovered by the Senate researchers.

Some flag manufacturers included the year 1799 in the coat of arms, as in the state seal; the seal had been adopted in that year. In 1914, the General Assembly changed the year to 1776, the year the United States Declaration of Independence was signed.

At some point, the coat of arms began to be replaced with the state seal. The Senate report indicates this happened sometime in the 1910s or 1920s, and may have been connected to the 1914 change in the state seal&#x27;s date and the need to conform newly produced flags to that change. The report notes that the first official state publication to use the seal instead of the coat of arms was the 1927 Georgia Official Register, which used a color version of the seal, adding that various versions of the seal were used on flags during this era, until a new drawing was prescribed in the 1950s.

=== Second flag (1956–2001) ===

In early 1955, chairman of the State Democratic Party and attorney for the Association County Commissioners of Georgia John Sammons Bell (who later served as a judge on the Georgia Court of Appeals) suggested a new state flag for Georgia that would incorporate the Confederate Battle Flag. At the 1956 session of the General Assembly, state senators Jefferson Lee Davis and Willis Harden introduced Senate Bill 98 to change the state flag. Signed into law on February 13, 1956, the bill became effective on July 1 of that year.
A copy of the new flag displayed at the 1956 signing ceremony shows slight differences from the state flag commonly produced (and shown here). In the 1956 version, the stars are larger, and only the center point of the central star points straight up. Also, the first copies of the 1956 flag used a different version of the state seal. (The 1920 Georgia State Seal was the state seal seen on these early examples. This is the seal seen on all later 1920 Design Georgia State Flags.) In the summer of 1954, a new redrawn state seal began to appear on state government documents. By the end of the decade, flag makers were using the new seal on Georgia&#x27;s official state flags.

The 1956 flag was adopted in an era when the Georgia General Assembly &quot;was entirely devoted to passing legislation that would preserve segregation and white supremacy&quot;, according to a 2000 research report by the Georgia Senate. There are few written records of what was said on the Georgia House and Senate floors when the 1956 flag bill was introduced and passed by the Georgia legislature, nor does Georgia state law provide for a statement of legislative intent when a bill is introduced, although former U.S. congressman James Mackay, one of the 32 House members who opposed the change, later said, &quot;There was only one reason for putting the flag on there: like the gun rack in the back of a pickup truck, it telegraphs a message.&quot; Additionally, the 2000 report concluded that the &quot;1956 General Assembly changed the state flag&quot; during &quot;an atmosphere of preserving segregation and resentment&quot; to the U.S. government&#x27;s rulings on integration.

The 2000 report states that the people who had supported the flag&#x27;s change in 1956 said, in recalling the event years later, that &quot;the change was made in preparation for the Civil War centennial, which was five years away; or that the change was made to commemorate and pay tribute to the Confederate veterans of the Civil War.&quot; Bell, who designed the 1956 flag and supported its adoption during the 1950s as a defense of the state&#x27;s &quot;institutions&quot;, which at the time included segregation, claimed years later that he did so to honor the Confederates. The 2000 report states that the claims that the flag was ostensibly changed in 1956 to honor Confederate soldiers came much later after the flag&#x27;s adoption, in an attempt by the change&#x27;s supporters to backtrack from prior support of segregation in an era where it was no longer acceptable, saying that the &quot;argument that the flag was changed in 1956 in preparation for the approaching Civil War centennial appears to be a retrospective or after-the-fact argument&quot; and that &quot;no one in 1956, including the flag&#x27;s sponsors, claimed that the change was in anticipation of the coming anniversary&quot;.

At the time, opposition to changing the flag came from various sides, including Confederate historical groups like the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC). Opponents to a change of the flag stated that incorporating the Confederate battle flag into the design would be too sectionalist and divisive, saying that people should show patriotism towards the United States rather than the defunct Confederacy, referring to the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance, which states that the U.S. is &quot;one nation ... indivisible&quot;. Opponents of the flag&#x27;s change also said that there was nothing wrong with the 1920 flag and that people were content with it. Others opposed changing the flag out of the burden it would place on those who would have to purchase a new flag to replace the outdated one.

The 2000 Georgia senate report and other critics have interpreted the adoption of the 1956 flag as a symbol of racist protest, citing legislation passed in 1956 which included bills rejecting Brown v. Board of Education and pro-segregationist comments by then-Governor Marvin Griffin, such as &quot;The rest of the nation is looking to Georgia for the lead in segregation.&quot;

Political pressure for a change in the official state flag increased during the 1990s, in particular during the run-up to the 1996 Olympic Games that were held in Atlanta. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) focused on the Georgia state flag as a major issue and some business leaders in Georgia felt that the perceptions of the flag were causing economic harm to the state. In 1992, Governor Zell Miller announced his intention to get the Confederate element removed, but the state legislature refused to pass any flag-modifying legislation. The matter was dropped after the 1993 legislative session. Many Atlanta residents and some Georgia politicians refused to fly the 1956 flag and flew the pre-1956 flag instead. The controversy extended outside of the borders of Georgia, with New York governor George Pataki removing the Georgia flag from an Albany display in protest, and two Georgia state senators removing the New York flag from the Georgia state house in retaliation.

=== Third flag (2001–2003) ===

Miller&#x27;s successor as governor, Roy Barnes, responded to increasing calls for a new state flag, and in 2001 hurried a replacement through the Georgia General Assembly. His new flag, designed by architect Cecil Alexander, sought a compromise, by featuring small versions of some (but not all) of Georgia&#x27;s former flags, including the controversial 1956 flag, under the words &quot;Georgia&#x27;s History&quot;. Those flags include a thirteen-star U.S. flag of the &quot;Betsy Ross&quot; design; the first Georgia flag (before 1879); the 1920–1956 Georgia flag; the prior state flag (1956–2001); and the current fifty-star U.S. flag.

In a 2001 survey of state and provincial flags in North America conducted by the North American Vexillological Association, the redesigned Georgia flag was ranked the worst by a wide margin. The group stated that the flag &quot;violates all the principles of good flag design&quot;. After the 1956 state flag was replaced in 2001, the Georgia city of Trenton adopted a modified version as its official city flag, in protest.

There was widespread opposition to the new flag, pejoratively referred to as the &quot;Barnes rag&quot;. It led, according to Barnes himself, to his defeat for reelection two years later; the flag was a major issue in the election.

=== Fourth flag (2003–present) ===

In 2002, Sonny Perdue was elected governor of Georgia, partially on a platform of allowing Georgians to choose their own flag in a state referendum. He authorized the Georgia legislature to design a new flag in 2003.

The Georgia General Assembly&#x27;s proposed flag was based on the First National Flag of the Confederacy, the Stars and Bars, which was less known than the Confederate battle flag, with a symbol based on the state&#x27;s coat of arms and the words &quot;In God We Trust&quot; placed within the circle of stars. Perdue signed the legislation into law on February 19, 2003.

The 2003 flag legislation also authorized a referendum on which of the two most recent flags (the 2001 and 2003 versions) would be adopted as the flag of the state; the 1956 flag was not an option. The referendum took place during the state&#x27;s March 2, 2004 presidential primary election. If the 2003 flag was rejected, the pre-2001 design would have been put to a vote. The 2003 design won 73.1% of the vote in the referendum.

<doc id="206744" wikidata="Q136146" url="?curid=206744" title="Chlorarachniophyte">
<text>The chlorarachniophytes are a small group of exclusively marine algae widely distributed in tropical and temperate waters. They are typically mixotrophic, ingesting bacteria and smaller protists as well as conducting photosynthesis. Normally they have the form of small amoebae, with branching cytoplasmic extensions that capture prey and connect the cells together, forming a net. These extensions are dependent on the presence of light and polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton. They may also form flagellate zoospores, which characteristically have a single subapical flagellum that spirals backwards around the cell body, and walled coccoid cells.

The chloroplasts were presumably acquired by ingesting some green alga. They are surrounded by four membranes, the outermost of which is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum, and contain a small nucleomorph between the middle two, which is a remnant of the alga&#x27;s nucleus. This contains a small amount of DNA and divides without forming a mitotic spindle. The origin of the chloroplasts from green algae is supported by their pigmentation, which includes chlorophylls &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, and by genetic similarities. The only other groups of algae that contain nucleomorphs are a few species of dinoflagellates, which also have plastids originating from green algae, and the cryptomonads, which acquired their chloroplasts from a red alga. 

The chlorarachniophytes only include five genera, which show some variation in their life-cycles and may lack one or two of the stages described above. Genetic studies place them among the Cercozoa, a diverse group of amoeboid and amoeboid-like protozoa.

The chlorarachniophytes were placed before in the order Rhizochloridales, class Xanthophyceae (e.g., Smith, 1938), as algae, or in order Rhizochloridea, class Xanthomonadina (e.g., Deflandre, 1956), as protozoa.

So far sexual reproduction has only been reported in two species; &quot;Chlorarachnion reptans&quot; and &quot;Cryptochlora perforans&quot;.

<text>The University of Adelaide is a public research university based in Adelaide, South Australia. Established in 1874, it is the third-oldest university in Australia. Its main campus in the Adelaide city centre includes many sandstone buildings of historical and architectural significance, such as Bonython Hall. Its royal charter awarded by Queen Victoria in 1881 allowed it to become the second university in the English-speaking world to confer degrees to women. It plans to merge with the neighbouring University of South Australia, is adjacent to the Australian Space Agency headquarters on Lot Fourteen and is part of the Adelaide BioMed City research precinct.

The university was founded at the former Royal South Australian Society of Arts by the Union College and studies were initially conducted at its Institute Building. The society was also the original birthplace of the South Australian Institute of Technology as the School of Mines and Industries. The institute later became the University of South Australia during the Dawkins Revolution following a merger with an advanced college dating back to the School of Art, also founded at the society. The two universities, which then accounted for approximately three-quarters of the state&#x27;s public university population, agreed to merge in mid-2023. The future combined institution will be rebranded as Adelaide University, previously a colloquial name for the university, with the merged state expected to become operational by 2026.

The university has four campuses, three in South Australia: its main North Terrace campus in central Adelaide, the Waite campus in Urrbrae, a regional campus in Roseworthy and a study centre in Melbourne, Victoria. Its academic activities are organised into three faculties, which are subdivided into numerous teaching schools. It also has several research subdivisions. In 2023, the university had a total revenue of , with from research grants and funding. It is a member of the Group of Eight, an association of research-intensive universities in Australia, and the Association of Pacific Rim Universities.

Notable alumni of the university include the first female prime minister of Australia, two presidents of Singapore, the first astronaut born in Australia and the first demonstrator of nuclear fusion. It is also associated with five Nobel laureates, constituting one-third of Australia&#x27;s total Nobel laureates, 117 Rhodes scholars and 164 Fulbright scholars. It has had a significant impact on the public life of South Australia, having educated many of the state&#x27;s earliest businesspeople, lawyers, medical professionals and politicians. It has also been associated with the development of penicillin, space exploration, sunscreen, the military tank, Wi-Fi, polymer banknotes and X-ray crystallography, and the study of viticulture and oenology.

==History==
=== Foundation ===
The history of the university dates back to the Union College established in 1872 to provide education to aspiring Protestant ministers who were previously required to travel to the United Kingdom. It provided education in the natural sciences, mathematics, English literature and theological studies of the Greek Testament. The college approached Scottish-born pastoralist Walter Watson Hughes with the proposal for a then-called Adelaide University with a request for endowment towards its creation. Following an agreement, the Adelaide University Association was established by the Union College on 23 September 1872 to manage the creation of the university.

The University of Adelaide, which is named after its founding city namesake to Queen Adelaide, was formally established on 6 November 1874 following the passage of &quot;The Adelaide University Act of 1874&quot; through the South Australian parliament. The parliament also provided a 2 hectare (5 acre) land grant for a campus. Its royal charter, which was granted by Queen Victoria in 1881, allowed the university to confer degrees to women. Its early benefactors, many of whom Scottish immigrants, made large donations to develop the university that are now worth tens of millions adjusted for inflation.

It was founded with the backing of its first benefactor Walter Hughes and Thomas Elder, also a Scottish-born pastoralist and another founder of the university, who each donated £20,000 towards the association. The university initially occupied the South Australian Institute Building prior to the construction of the University Building which housed the entire university at the time. Elder also bequeathed an additional £65,000 in his will following his death in 1897 of which £20,000 were allocated to set up the Elder Conservatorium of Music. Other donors include Scottish philosopher William Mitchell who also taught literature and psychology, established many teaching schools and served as vice-chancellor and chancellor of the institution. The University Building, now the chancellery, was later renamed to the Mitchell Building in his honour.

According to its founding Act, the university was intended as a secular institution to &quot;promote sound learning in the Province of South Australia&quot; to be &quot;open to all classes and denominations of Her Majesty&#x27;s subjects&quot;. It commenced its first class, a Latin lecture towards the Bachelor of Arts, in March 1876 following its inauguration at the Adelaide Town Hall. Its first chancellor was former premier Richard Hanson and its first vice-chancellor was Anglican bishop Augustus Short. Its first graduate was Thomas Ainslie Caterer, who graduated in 1879 with a Bachelor of Arts. In 1882, it was also the first university in Australia to provide degree programs in science and its faculty of arts was inaugurated in 1887. Its Adelaide Law School was established in 1883 as Australia&#x27;s second law school, its medical school in 1885 and its Adelaide Business School in 1902 as the country&#x27;s first business school. They have produced some of Australia&#x27;s earliest businesspeople, lawyers, medical professionals and politicians.

Another early benefactor Robert Barr Smith, who had previously studied under financial hardship in Scotland and served on the University Council for 19 years, had long desired for education to be accessible to all students in Adelaide. In 1913, Robert wrote at the age of 89 that &quot;&quot;tho&#x27; in its vigorous and lusty youth&quot;,&quot; the university was poorly endowed and constructed on little land. His donations included a combined £9000 towards books for the then-struggling university library and £500 towards radiation research by Lawrence and William Henry Bragg who later won the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Bonython Hall, the great hall of the university, was built in 1936 following a donation of over £50,000 from the owner of &quot;The Advertiser&quot; newspaper, John Langdon Bonython, who was inspired following his visit to the Great Hall of the University of Sydney. The hall, which is used during graduation ceremonies among other events, was designed by architect Louis Laybourne-Smith based on medieval great halls in a Gothic Revival architecture style inspired by the ancient universities in Europe.

The institution was the third of its kind on the Australian continent after the Universities of Sydney and Melbourne, which then educated solely men. The university, which allowed women to study alongside men since its commencement including eligibility for all academic prizes and honours, became the second university in the English-speaking world following the University of London in 1878 to formally admit women on equal terms as men in 1881. This was following a royal charter granted by Queen Victoria that year, which allowed for women to be conferred degrees. This has contributed to its long history of achieving notable milestones and firsts for women&#x27;s rights in higher education.

In 1991, it formally opened two additional campuses in Greater Adelaide outside of the city centre. These included the Waite and Roseworthy campuses, though the university operated at the Waite site since at least 1924 as the Waite Agricultural Research Institute. The Roseworthy campus was the former Roseworthy Agricultural College which, although affiliated with the university since 1905, was an independent institution prior to their merger. Additionally, the university previously operated research facilities across in Thebarton approximately north of the campus until 2020 when it was sold for housing development. The flames for several summer Olympic Games, among other sporting events, were developed there with the now-called FCT Flames.

=== Neighbouring amalgamations ===
The SA School of Art was founded in 1856 by the former Royal South Australian Society of Arts, predating the university which was also established there. The independent art school, which went through many name changes, resided for most of its history at the Jubilee Exhibition Building which was later transferred to the university in 1929. It remained on the campus until 1962 when the building was demolished to make way for several university buildings.

The Jubilee Exhibition Building was also the birthplace of the South Australian Institute of Technology which was established in 1889 as the SA School of Mines and Industries. It moved to the neighbouring Brookman Building in 1903, named after the Scottish-born businessman George Brookman who contributed £15,000 towards its construction. The institution acted &quot;de facto&quot; as part of the university while remaining legally distinct. The relationship was expanded in 1903 with the two institutions formally agreeing to combine teaching, laboratories and examinations across fields of engineering and sciences. Despite the university later establishing its own faculty of engineering in 1937, the reciprocal relationship remained intertwined to the University Council and studies completed at the institute were recognised as equivalent studies eligible for credit towards university courses. The institution expanded into the site of the former Adelaide Technical High School in 1963, to the regional city of Whyalla in 1962 and to the Adelaide suburb of Mawson Lakes as &quot;The Levels&quot; in 1972. In 1965, it was designated an advanced college which initiated an expansion in the variety of courses available.

The Adelaide Teachers College, which changed names and shifted locations multiple times throughout its existence, was established in 1876. Despite not being located at the university campus until 1900, students from the institution attended university lectures since at least 1878. In 1921, it renamed to the Adelaide Teachers College, in line with other interstate teachers colleges. Despite offers from the university to take control of the college, which was heavily integrated into the university, the Education Department retained administrative authority throughout its early history. The Hartley Building, named after former vice-chancellor John Anderson Hartley, was built as its permanent home in 1927.

It continued constructing new buildings such as the Scott Theatre, Madley and Schulz buildings and eventually renamed to the Adelaide College of the Arts and Education. It also established additional teachers colleges in other parts of the city including Magill. Following a series of mergers, the colleges expanded to become advanced colleges which all later amalgamated with the original mother college to become the South Australian College of Advanced Education in 1982. The combined institution continued its presence alongside the university as its City campus and maintained joint teaching, facilities and committees. The campus merged with the university in 1991.

Stronger demand for advanced college places throughout the country resulted from a broadening appeal of higher education beyond the traditionally elite education provided by the universities. Advanced colleges were originally designed to complement universities, forming a binary system modelled on that of the United Kingdom. It was originally created by the Menzies government following World War II on the advice of a committee led by physicist Leslie H. Martin, during a period of high population growth and corresponding demand for secondary and tertiary education. This sector ceased to exist when, between 1989 and 1992, the Hawke-Keating government implemented the sweeping reforms of Education Minister John Dawkins that dismantled the binary system. The states, eager for increased education funding, merged the colleges either with existing universities or with each other to form new universities. Following its expansion and increasing autonomy from the university, the South Australian Institute of Technology was given the option to merge with either TAFE South Australia or the South Australian College of Advanced Education. It chose to merge with the latter advanced college resulting in the establishment of the University of South Australia, which continues to remain neighbours with the university.

=== Ongoing merger with the University of South Australia ===

The University of South Australia is the state&#x27;s third public university, a continuation of the former South Australian Institute of Technology that merged with most of the remaining SACAE, and maintained their presence next to the University of Adelaide, in the suburbs of Mawson Lakes and Magill and in the regional city of Whyalla. Its expansion over the next few decades, including to sites on the west end of North Terrace, and broadening fields of studies contributed to its status as the state&#x27;s largest university by student population. It also became the second-largest university nationally by number of online students, either in the state or from other parts of the country, and expanded to Mount Gambier in 2005.

In June 2018, the University of Adelaide and University of South Australia began discussions regarding the possibility of a merger. The proposition was dubbed a &quot;super uni&quot; by then South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, and Simon Birmingham, but the merger was called off in October 2018 by the University of South Australia, which was less keen. Vice-chancellor David Lloyd, in an email to University of South Australia staff, claimed that the amalgamation lacked a compelling case. This statement was contradicted by the University of Adelaide&#x27;s chancellor who said that the merger continues to be in the state&#x27;s best interests and a spokesperson for the university added that it was still open to future talks. Following the release of several internal FOI documents retrieved by &quot;ABC News&quot;, it was later revealed that the merger talks failed due to disagreements on the post-merger institution&#x27;s leadership structure. The name &quot;Adelaide University of South Australia&quot; was agreed upon by both universities and Chris Schacht, who previously served on the University of Adelaide Council, alleged that the merger talks failed due to disagreement on which vice-chancellor would replace the other following their amalgamation.

In early 2022, the topic of a merger was raised again by the new state government led by premier Peter Malinauskas, which proposed setting up an independent commission to investigate the possibility of a merger between the state&#x27;s three public universities should they decline. He had made an election promise to take a heavy-handed approach towards the merger to reduce students departing to higher-ranking institutions on the east coast and to improve the state&#x27;s ability to attract international students and researchers. At the time, staff&#x27;s opinions were evenly divided on the idea of the commission. Following the appointment of merger advocate Peter Høj as University of Adelaide vice-chancellor, both universities announced that a merger would once again be considered. The universities began a feasibility study into a potential merger at the end of the year. The invitation to merger negotiations was rejected by Flinders University, the state&#x27;s third public university.

The agreement for the merger was reached on 1 July 2023 by the two universities, which then accounted for approximately two-thirds of the state&#x27;s public university population, in consultation with the South Australian Government. The rationale for the amalgamation was a larger institutional scale may be needed in order to increase the universities&#x27; ranking positions, ability to secure future research income and a net positive impact on the state economy. The two universities argued that by combining their expertise, resources and finances into a single institution, they can be more financially viable, with stronger teaching and research outcomes. Support for the merger among existing staff were mixed, with a National Tertiary Education Union SA survey showing that only a quarter were in favour of the amalgamation. Warren Bebbington, who previously served as vice-chancellor at the University of Adelaide, described the proposed institution as a &quot;lumbering dinosaur&quot; in reference to its timing during an ongoing federal review of the higher education sector. Vice-chancellor Colin Stirling described plans to provide the new institution with in research funding and scholarships as &quot;unfair&quot; to students who choose to study at Flinders University. The combined figure was later revised to to include land purchases, with an additional research fund set up for Flinders University.

In November 2023, legislation passed state parliament enabling the creation of the new university to be named &quot;Adelaide University&quot;, previously a colloquial name used by the University of Adelaide. An application for self-accreditation authority was submitted to the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA) on 15 January 2024, which was needed for the institution to offer courses that issue qualifications. Following approval on 22 May 2024, students starting studies at the pre-merger institutions from 2025 onwards will be issued degree certificates from Adelaide University. Students enrolled on or prior to 2024 will also be able to opt in adding antecedent institutions&#x27; names and logos on their parchments. The combined institution is expected to become operational by January 2026, with an additional transitional period extending to 2034. It is projected to have 70,000 students at launch, with one-in-four students being international students, and contribute approximately to the Australian economy annually. The amalgamation has been subject to mixed reactions.

==Campuses and buildings==

===Adelaide===
The primary campus of the university is located on North Terrace in the Adelaide city centre, one of four terraces bounding the inner city&#x27;s central business district. It is co-located on its west with the historical Royal South Australian Society of Arts which included the Art Gallery of South Australia, the South Australian Museum and the State Library of South Australia. Built in the Gothic Revival architecture style in 1882, the Mitchell Building is the oldest building on the campus. It was called the University Building until 1961 when it was renamed after William Mitchell. The Barr Smith Library is the main library on the site and is notable for its large reading room. On the western border, the campus is planned to merge with the neighbouring &quot;City East&quot; campus of the University of South Australia and the &quot;City West&quot; campus on the west end of the terrace to form the combined &quot;Adelaide City&quot; campus following the merger.

Bonython Hall, the great hall used during graduation ceremonies, is a prominent building facing the terrace. The hall takes inspiration from the Great Hall of the University of Sydney and is also constructed in the Gothic Revival architecture style to resemble the medieval halls used by the ancient universities in Europe. In between it and the Mitchell Building, which both face the terrace, is the Elder Hall which is its oldest great hall. It is a large concert hall that is used by the Elder Conservatorium of Music among others and, along with Bonython Hall, both feature large organs.

The university also has other venues including the Scott Theatre, Little Theatre and the College Green. The Scott Theatre is the largest lecture theatre on site and is often hired out for performances of various kinds such as the Adelaide Fringe events. It features two revolving stages and a seating capacity of 635 people. The Little Theatre is located in the Cloisters and is primarily used for dramatic performances by the Theatre Guild. The College Green stretches from the Cloisters across the lawns down to Victoria Drive, next to the River Torrens. It hosts various social events throughout the year including parties, live bands, DJs and open-air cinema among others. It was created in response to the impact of social distancing restrictions owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, which hit many live music venues.

The Napier and Ligertwood Buildings were built following the demolition of the Jubilee Exhibition Building in 1962. They are named after Mellis Napier and George Ligertwood who were both former chancellors. Some other notable buildings include the Ingkarni Wardli Building, Darling Building, Hartley Building, Mawson Building and the Helen Mayo North and South Buildings. The Braggs Building, named after two Nobel laureates associated with the university, was built in 2013 and features a large number of cross-disciplinary scientific research facilities. The Adelaide University Footbridge was constructed in 1937 following a decade of delays during the Great Depression. The footbridge, which crosses the River Torrens, features cast iron balustrading that is a popular location for love locks.

The Adelaide University Union redevelopment, also known as Union Buildings or Union Building Group, was completed in stages between 1967 and 1975. It created some of the most significant buildings in the complex. The redevelopment was designed by lead architect Robert Dickson and includes a heritage-listed group of buildings including the Union House, the Lady Symon Building named after the wife of Josiah Symon, the George Murray Building, the Cloisters and the Western Annexe. The earlier Georgian-style buildings were designed by the architects Woods, Bagot, Jory and Laybourne-Smith who also designed Bonython Hall, the Mitchell Gates, the Johnson Laboratories, the Barr Smith Library and the Benham Laboratories. The Adelaide University Union Cloisters were built in 1929 as a war memorial to the 470 University of Adelaide members who served during World War I, of which 64 had died during the war. There are three plaques on the site, with the latest added in 2015 to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli landing.

The university also has a presence in the adjacent Lot Fourteen precinct, that is also home to the national headquarters of the Australian Space Agency among other institutions in the fields of science and technology. It also operates the National Wine Centre further along of the terrace and adjacent to the Adelaide Botanic Garden. On the west end of North Terrace, the Adelaide Health and Medical Sciences Building is surrounded by the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute and the Royal Adelaide Hospital forming part of the Adelaide BioMed City precinct. The biomedical teaching and research facility was completed in 2017 and is home to various clinical and simulation facilities in the fields of healthcare and medicine.

===Waite===

The Waite campus specialises in agricultural science, viticulture, oenology, plant breeding, food research and biotechnology. It is located in the suburb of Urrbrae in Adelaide&#x27;s eastern foothills, adjacent to the Urrbrae Agricultural High School, on of which a large amount was donated through the will of Scottish-born pastoralist Peter Waite. Approximately half of the land donated was dedicated for studies in agriculture and the remainder as a public park. The Waite Research Precinct is home to several research centres.

The Waite Agricultural Research Institute was established in 1924. Its first director was Arnold E. V. Richardson. Later renamed to the Waite Research Institute, it produces approximately 70% of Australia&#x27;s research output in viticulture and oenology and around 80% of cereal varieties used in southern Australia were created there. A Soil Research Centre was founded in 1929 with a donation of £10,000 from Harold Darling of J. Darling and Son, grain merchants. In 2004, State Premier Mike Rann opened the A$9.2 million Plant Genomics Centre at the campus. In 2010, he opened The Plant Accelerator, a A$30 million research facility which is the largest and most advanced of its kind in the world.

A number of other organisations are co-located in the precinct including the South Australian Research and Development Institute (or &quot;SARDI&quot;, part of Primary Industries and Regions SA which is also headquartered at the campus), Australian Grain Technologies, Australian Wine Research Institute and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).

The Urrbrae House built in 1891, now a museum, served as the home of Peter and Matilda Waite who purchased the land with support from Thomas Elder. Its interior &amp; Co is designed by Aldam Heaton &amp; Co, who was also responsible for designing interiors for the Titanic. The campus is also home to the Waite Arboretum and Conservation Reserve. The Waite Arboretum is a tree museum which is home to over 2,500 tree specimens from over 1,000 taxa, many of which are endangered in the wild. The Waite Conservation Reserve, also co-located on the campus, is home to native plants and wildlife.

===Roseworthy===


Located north of the city, the Roseworthy campus comprises of farmland and is a large centre for agricultural research and veterinary sciences. It was the site of the former Roseworthy Agricultural College which was established in 1883 as the first agricultural college in Australia. The Roseworthy College Hall, now the student hub, is the main building on the campus and was built in 1884. Its clock tower features a Swiss precision clock that is synced via GPS with Greenwich Mean Time. The clock tower was missing a clock for more than 120 years until 2003, when the mechanism was finally added following a donation. The colleges&#x27; teaching and research in oenology and viticulture were transferred to the Waite campus, along with the bulk of its work in plant breeding. Before studies in oenology were transferred to the Waite campus, the college had produced a number of highly regarded and awarded winemakers and wine critics.

Following the merger, the campus expanded its focus in dryland agriculture, natural resource management and animal production by the mid-1990s. The campus is also now home to South Australia&#x27;s first veterinary science training program, which commenced in 2008. The Veterinary Science Centre houses teaching facilities including a surgical skills suite, a public veterinary clinic offering general practice as well as emergency and specialist veterinary services for pet animals. There are also specialised pathology laboratories at the centre for teaching, research and diagnostics. In 2013, the veterinary science facilities were expanded with the opening of the Equine Health and Performance Centre, a specialised facility for equine surgery, internal medicine, sports medicine and reproduction.

The Memorial Chapel is a notable building on the Roseworthy campus. It was built in 1955 to memorialise students from the former college who died during World War I, World War II and the Boer Wars. The entrance features a limestone statue of a young soldier &quot;discarding his uniform in readiness to return to the land&quot;. The organ of the chapel was donated by the mother of a student that died in New Guinea during World War II. There is a time capsule from 1976 located near the chapel. It is expected to be opened in 2026.

In 2021, the Roseworthy Solar and Energy Storage Project was opened on the campus. It included a solar farm with an output of 1.2MW with a 420/1200kWh hybrid battery. Its 3,200 solar panels are estimated to produce 42% of the campus&#x27; energy requirements.

==Governance and structure==
=== Faculties and departments ===
Research and teaching is organised into three faculties, each of which contains a number of constituent schools, departments and institutes. The current faculties at the university were developed over a series of mergers, the latest of which were in 2022 following a merger between the Arts and Professions faculties and the Faculty of Sciences into the Faculty of Engineering, Computer and Mathematical Sciences. The establishment of faculties and academic departments is formally the responsibility of the University Council.



=== University Council ===
The main governing body of the institution is its Council. It is the executive committee responsible for managing operations, setting policies and appointing the chancellor and vice-chancellor. The Council comprises the chancellor, vice-chancellor, a member of the academic staff, a member of the professional staff, an undergraduate student, a postgraduate student, at least one member with a commercial background, two members with prior experience in financial management and other members appointed by the selection committee. The selection committee, which comprises the chancellor and six other appointed members, can appoint members to the Council to serve for between 2 and 4 years. This excludes elected staff and student members, which have a term limit of 2 years.

==== Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor ====
The chancellor of the university is a limitless term position that is mainly ceremonial and is held by former Federal Court judge Catherine Branson who succeeded Kevin Scarce following his retirement in May 2020. Branson was appointed by the University Council. The current vice-chancellor is Danish biochemist Peter Høj, who began his role in February 2021 following similar roles at the University of South Australia and the University of Queensland. While the chancellor&#x27;s office is ceremonial, the vice-chancellor serves as the university&#x27;s de facto principal administrative officer. The university&#x27;s internal governance is carried out by the University Council formed through the University of Adelaide Act 1971. The legislation, which superseded the Adelaide University Act 1874, is scheduled to be superseded by the Adelaide University Act 2023.

=== Finances and endowment ===
In 2023, the University of Adelaide had a total revenue of (2022 – ) and a total expenditure of (2022 – ). Key sources of income included from research grants and fees (2022 – ), from other research funding (2022 – ), from tuition fees and grants (2022 – ), from HESA funding (2022 – ) and from donations and investments (2022 – ). At year-end the university had endowments of (2022 – ) and total net assets of (2022 – ).

=== Heraldry and insignia ===
The university uses a number of symbols to represent the institution. The present logo is based on the coat of arms. Other symbols utilised by the university includes a flag, also based on the coat of arms, as well as a ceremonial mace. The university also uses several taglines including its motto and the slogans &quot;seek light&quot; and &quot;make history&quot;. The overall branding is expected to be superseded following the merger.

Additionally, Adelaide University Sport has its own crest and motto.

==== Coat of arms ====
While all Australian universities have common seals that are used on parchments, some Australian universities also possess a coat of arms. These were usually grant by the College of Arms in London due to, as opposed to the United Kingdom and Canada, an absence of a national heraldic authority. The coat of arms of the university was grant during the reign of George V in 1925 and has historically since been used on all degree parchments issued by the university. While some universities such as the Universities of Western Australia and Queensland have modified the coat of arms issued on parchments over time, its design has mostly remained the same with the exception of a minor tweak to the crux. The motto in Latin reads &quot;Sub Cruce Lumen&quot; translated &quot;the light (of learning) under the (Southern) Cross&quot;. The official coat of arms, in heraldic terminology, is:
As part of the merger, the coat of arms has been &quot;de facto&quot; retired for new students and will only be available to University of Adelaide alumni and continuing students who started their programs on or before 2024.

==== University mace ====
Many universities possess ceremonial maces used during graduation ceremonies. The University of Adelaide Mace was forged by silversmiths using silver-gilt under the supervision of Frederick Millward Grey. It features the coat of arms on an orb symbolising the world protruding from an open book representing learning with gum leaves-inspired design. Grey was a designer based at the School of Fine Arts in Adelaide which later became an antecedent institution of the University of South Australia. The first mace bearer was KH Boykett in 1926 who carried it during the 50th anniversary jubilee of the first classes at St Peter&#x27;s Cathedral. The mace symbolises protection of the chancellor and the mace bearer, who is usually a student of the university, carries it in front of the chancellor during ceremonies.

==Academic profile==
The university is a member of the Group of Eight, a coalition of research-led Australian universities. It is also a member of the Association of Pacific Rim Universities, an international association of research-intensive universities, and the former Academic Consortium 21. It plans to merge with the University of South Australia, forms part of the Adelaide BioMed City research precinct and is a close partner with the Australian Space Agency whose national headquarters is located alongside it on Lot Fourteen. The university also offers a wide range of free online MOOC courses on digital learning platforms edX and FutureLearn, including the MathTrackX bridging program.

The university also offers degree programs in Singapore as part of a joint venture with the Ngee Ann Kongsi foundation.

=== Research and publications ===
In 2023, the University of Adelaide had a total research income of , of which was from the National Competitive Grants Program; from other public sector research; from Cooperative Research Centres; and from industry and other research. Additionally, it also received from the Research Support Program and from the Research Training Program as research block grants.

In the 2018 ERA National Report, the Australian Research Council evaluated work produced between 2014 and 2018. 100 per cent of the university&#x27;s research activity was judged to be &quot;at or above world standard&quot; (3-5*) with 57 of the 67 fields of research evaluated being &quot;above world standard&quot; (4*) or &quot;well above world standard&quot; (5*). The university had a positive trajectory since 2010.

=== Research institutes ===
The university operates a large number of disciplinary-specific research institutes in partnership with other research institutions and private enterprises. Notable examples include:

==== Australian Institute for Machine Learning ====
The Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML) is an artificial intelligence and machine learning research and translation institute based on Lot Fourteen, a business and technology precinct. It is located in a former Royal Adelaide Hospital building in-between the Australian Space Agency headquarters and the University of South Australia&#x27;s Brookman Building. Established in 2018 with funding from the South Australian government, it is the largest university-based research site dedicated to machine learning in Australia, as well as ranking among the global top sites for its computer vision research capability.

The institute runs on an open access basis; most of its research is open to the rest of the world, either through conferences and journals or via open source software. Its researchers have used machine learning to support industries such as agriculture, medical imaging, defence, space exploration, manufacturing, mining operations and filmmaking. Notable partners have included its foundational partner Lockheed Martin, Rising Sun Pictures and Microsoft.

It was established through in funding from the federal government, which was obtained with the support of South Australian Senator Stirling Griff. It is jointly resourced by the federal Department of Health and Aged Care, the Central Adelaide Local Health Network, and the University of Adelaide.

SAiGENCI is located in the Adelaide Health and Medical Sciences Building, in between the University of South Australia&#x27;s Bradley Building and the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, adjacent to the Royal Adelaide Hospital.

====Stretton Institute====
The Stretton Institute is named in honour of Hugh Stretton, who was professor and reader at the university from 1954 until he retired in 1989. It was established in 2020 under director Adam Graycar &quot;to conduct research on public policy issues in a multi-disciplinary and multi-method manner and to contribute to policy agendas locally and beyond&quot;. No research was undertaken in the first year as it focused on engaging with stakeholders and building recognition. The COVID-19 pandemic delayed some of its plans, such as the inaugural &quot;Hugh Stretton Oration&quot;. In 2020, through online meetings and webinars with stakeholders, the institute established five initiatives: Agrifood Policy; Building a City for the Future; Climate Change and Energy Transition; Democracy, Security, Trust and Integrity; and Economic Productivity through Population.

The inaugural Hugh Stretton Oration was held in 2021, with Glyn Davis as the speaker, after being postponed from 2020. Since then, speakers included Natasha Stott Despoja, Mark Butler and Danielle Wood.

==== Waite Research Institute ====
The Waite Research Institute specialises and conducts research in agricultural science, viticulture, oenology, plant breeding, food research and biotechnology. It is located on the Waite campus in Adelaide&#x27;s south-eastern foothills, in the suburb of Urrbrae on , a large amount of which was donated through the will of Scottish-born pastoralist Peter Waite. It was established in 1924 as the Waite Agricultural Research Institute. The institute produces approximately 70% of Australia&#x27;s research output in viticulture and oenology and around 80% of cereal varieties used in southern Australia were created there. A Soil Research Centre was founded in 1929 with a donation of £10,000 from Harold Darling of J. Darling and Son, grain merchants. In 2004, State Premier Mike Rann opened the Plant Genomics Centre at the campus. In 2010, he opened &quot;The Plant Accelerator&quot;, a research facility which is the largest and most advanced of its kind in the world.

=== Student outcomes ===
The Australian Government&#x27;s QILT conducts national surveys documenting the student life cycle from enrolment through to employment. These surveys place more emphasis on criteria such as student experience, graduate outcomes and employer satisfaction than perceived reputation, research output and citation counts.

In the 2023 Employer Satisfaction Survey, graduates of the university had an overall employer satisfaction rate of 83.8%.

In the 2023 Graduate Outcomes Survey, graduates of the university had a full-time employment rate of 75.1% for undergraduates and 89.5% for postgraduates. The initial full-time salary was for undergraduates and for postgraduates.

In the 2023 Student Experience Survey, undergraduates at the university rated the quality of their entire educational experience at 78.1% meanwhile postgraduates rated their overall education experience at 72.7%.

=== Admissions process ===
The admissions process is managed by the South Australian Tertiary Admissions Centre. Established in 1977, it is the main administrative body processing applications for tertiary institutions in South Australia and the Northern Territory.

Qualifications that can be used for consideration include Australian and New Zealand high school certificates or international equivalent, a Grade Point Average from prior higher education, TAFE and other RTO qualifications at Certificate IV or higher, competitive scores from a Skills for Tertiary Admissions Test and prior work experience or military service with the Australian Defence Force. Competitive courses, including in healthcare and medicine, have additional requirements.

Additionally, the University of Adelaide College and Eynesbury College offer pathways into university programs.

=== Academic calendar ===
The academic year is divided into two semesters and optional summer and winter schools. The weeks of term are called &quot;teaching weeks&quot; and there are also study without teaching, or &quot;SWOT&quot;, weeks before examinations. All terms start on a Monday. Additionally, there is an &quot;Orientation&quot; week, informally known as O&#x27; Week, for first year students prior to the start of the two main semesters. Certain courses operate on trimesters with the model expected to eventually replace semesters.

== Libraries and archives ==
The library system comprises four libraries located across its three campuses. The largest library is the Barr Smith Library which is located with the Sir John Salmond Law Library on the main campus and the two satellite campuses each have their own libraries. Additionally, the university also has several open access repositories and university members have subscriptions to online academic journals and databases. The State Library of South Australia is also co-located with the university.

=== Barr Smith Library ===

The Barr Smith Library is the third-oldest university library in Australia and was originally located in the Mitchell Building. The library purchased its first book in 1877 for £11, prior to its formal establishment in 1882. It was later named after its founder Robert Barr Smith who throughout his life had donated £9,000 to purchase books towards the struggling library, which previously had no librarian and an annual budget of £200 of which £150 were spent on books. William Barlow, the registrar, acted as the &quot;de facto&quot; first librarian of the then-small library and R. J. M. Clucas was the first &quot;official&quot; librarian in 1900.

Following Robert&#x27;s death in 1915, an additional endowment of £11,000 in 1920 was made by his family. In 1928, his son Tony Elder Barr Smith donated almost £35,000 towards a new building for the library to reduce congestion at its original site. Robert&#x27;s granddaughter Christine Margaret Mcgregor also donated almost 5,000 books in 1974. The building was designed in the Georgian Revival architecture style by Walter Hervey Bagot of the Adelaide-based architecture firm Woods, Bagot &amp; Laybourne Smith and was inspired by Kensington Palace in London. Following its completion, its collection was transferred from the Mitchell Building through a zip line. The building features red-brick exteriors with an entrance with Corinthian pillars below an inscription reading &quot;The Barr Smith Library&quot;. It was later expanded twice to increase capacity, reaching a peak of 2 million books in 1999.

The Barr Smith Reading Room is a notable feature of the library on Level 2. It features oak flooring and furniture with white pillars holding the guilded and ivory arches that form the rounded ceiling. Between the pillars and the arches are two large Latin inscriptions that run across both sides of the room in gold and commemorate the donations from Robert and his family who played a major role in its development. In mid-2023, over 61 paper planes were found in ledges around the ceiling of the reading room, including one made using a university brochure dating back to 1991.

The library is also home to a collection of rare books, the archives documenting the development of the university among other collections across various subject areas. This includes books belonging to Samuel Way&#x27;s collection, who had donated 16,000 books.
=== Sir John Salmond Law Library ===
Established in 1883, the Sir John Salmond Law Library holds a collection of legal works from Australian and overseas sources including the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and the United States. In 1967, the law library moved to the Ligertwood Building, which was among those that replaced the demolished Jubilee Exhibition Building. It was renamed two years later after John William Salmond who was the third Professor of Law at the Adelaide Law School.

=== Roseworthy Library ===

The Roseworthy Campus Library, formerly the Roseworthy Agricultural College Library, is located on the Roseworthy campus.

It dates back to the former Tassie Memorial Library which was funded by John Tassie in 1920. It was built as a memorial to his son, also named John Tassie, who was a student at the then Roseworthy College who died during World War I in France. It was later expanded in 1945 through donations by A Lowrie, the widow of former principal William Lowrie. The William Lowrie Memorial Annexe, which connected to the previous library in a T-shape, was completed in 1947. The library moved to its current site in 1974 due to increasing size constraints with the former site now used as a gymnasium.

=== Waite Woolhouse Library ===
The Waite Campus Library, also known as the Woolhouse Library, is located on the Waite campus in Urrbrae.

==Museums and collections==
=== Tate Museum ===
The Tate Museum is one of the largest geological museums in Australia, with a collection of approximately 29,000 rocks and fossils including meteorites, tektites, asteroids and specimens of early life. It was established in 1902 following the death of its namesake botanist and geologist Ralph Tate, though the museum existed informally since 1881 when he first began the collection. In 1952, it moved from the former Prince of Wales Building to the Mawson Laboratories named after geologist and explorer Douglas Mawson. The museum also hosts artefacts from Mawson&#x27;s various expeditions to the Antarctic, including one of his original sleighs. Its first official curator is Tony Milnes who had worked to restore and document the large collection. Notable specimens include some of earth&#x27;s earliest organisms, a number of which are from up to 550 million years ago, and segments of an asteroid that smashed into the state&#x27;s Gawler Ranges around 580 million years ago.

===Waite Historic Precinct===
The Waite Historic Precinct includes the Urrbrae House museum, Waite Arboretum, and Waite Conservation Reserve. The museum resides in the former home of Peter Waite and was built in 1891. Its interior is designed by Aldam Heaton &amp; Co, who was also responsible for designing interiors for the Titanic. The Waite Arboretum, a tree museum, is home to over 2,500 tree specimens from over 1,000 taxa, many of which are endangered in the wild. The annual rainfall at the arboretum is 622mm. The Waite Conservation Reserve is home to native plants and fauna.

== Other divisions ==
Other notable divisions of the university include:

=== Elder Conservatorium ===

Established in 1883, the Elder Conservatorium of Music is the oldest tertiary music academy in Australia. It offers study and research programs in jazz, classical performance, musical theatre, classical voice, pop music, sonic arts, music production, song-writing, music composition, conducting, teaching, ensembles and performance studies. It is also home to the Australian String Quartet, Sia Furler Institute and the Centre for Aboriginal Studies in Music. The conservatorium also offers theatre performances and &quot;Lunchtime&quot; and &quot;After Hours&quot; concert series. The academy&#x27;s first Professor of Music was Cambridge graduate Joshua Ives, also the first professor of music in Australia. Edward Harold Davies was the first Australian to graduate with a Doctor of Music in 1902 and Ruby Claudia Davy was the first Australian woman to earn the doctorate.

The Elder Hall used by the conservatorium was built following the death of its namesake and music lover Thomas Elder who left £20,000 towards its construction. The founding stone, made from nearby gumtree, was placed on 26 September 1898 by then-state governor Thomas Fowell Buxton. The building was officially opened exactly two years later on 26 September 1900 in a formal ceremony despite having been already used for months. &quot;The South Australian Register&quot; reported the next day that the great hall was opened by Lord Tennyson &quot;&quot;positively for the last time&quot; and that &quot;the majority of those who were present had already attended at two more or less appropriate ceremonial openings of the Elder Hall&quot;&quot;. Its current organ is built by Casavant Fréres of Quebec in 1979, having replaced the previous Dodd organ that later was purchased by St Mark&#x27;s Cathedral in Port Pirie.

The great hall, which was previously used for graduation ceremonies until the construction of Bonython Hall in 1936, was constructed in the Florentine Gothic architectural style integrating freestone from Mount Gambier.

=== National Wine Centre ===

Located in the Adelaide Park Lands at the eastern end of North Terrace, the National Wine Centre offers some of the university&#x27;s oenology courses. Opened in 2001, the facility also hosts public exhibitions about winemaking and its industry in South Australia. It contains an interactive permanent exhibition of winemaking, introducing visitors to the technology, varieties and styles of wine. It also has wine tasting areas, giving visitors the opportunity to taste and compare wines from across Australia. The building, which is adjacent to the Adelaide Botanic Gardens, was designed by Phillip Cox and Grieve Gillett and uses building materials to reflect items used in making wine.

==Student life==

===Student association===

Founded in 1895, the Adelaide University Union, trading as YouX, is one of the oldest students&#x27; unions in Australia. The union operates both as the representative voice for university students and as a provider of a wide range of services. It is democratically controlled through its Board and Students Representatives Council and is run by elected student officers. The union also supports a range of services, including numerous clubs and societies, social events and an advice service. Union members also receive various discounts including at the UniBar, cafes and shops.

As of 2024, there are over 175 clubs and societies under the umbrella of the union. These include the Adelaide University Sciences Association (the oldest society at the union not related to sports), the Adelaide Medical Students&#x27; Society established in 1889 and formerly the Adelaide University Sports Association whose founding clubs predate and ultimately founded the union. The sports association, which was founded in 1896, became directly affiliated with the university in 2010.

In September 2024, YouX and the University of South Australia Student Association announced their intention to merge.

=== Annual Prosh ===
The student union also organises the annual &quot;Prosh&quot; week events inspired by the medieval tradition of &quot;ragging&quot; or &quot;an extensive display of noisy disorderly conduct, carried on in defiance of authority or discipline&quot;. The annual &quot;Procesh&quot; procession began in 1905 as a means for students to poke fun at established South Australian institutions, though ragging at the university dates back to the late 19th century. In one example, multiple alarm clocks set and hid by students behind books made constant interruptions during a 1896 ceremony at the former Mitchell Building library. The Prosh parade has in modern times included live band performances on flatbed trucks, student club-made floats and booze cruisers transporting inebriated students. Among notable pranks, students suspended a Holden car on Adelaide University Footbridge in 1971 above the River Torrens as part of &quot;Operation Bridge-hang&quot;.

Since 1954, the event has also involved the sale of satirical newspapers in public settings. The &quot;Prosh Rag&quot;, later an annual issue of the On Dit student magazine, contains humorous references to various well-known persons of the day. It has been sold on city streets by students to raise funds for charity as an attempt to legitimise the event following attempts to ban it in the early 1950s. Since at least the 1960s, the event and magazine has often been involved in controversial topics including Australia&#x27;s involvement in the Vietnam War, apartheid, nuclear warfare, Aboriginal rights and the general administration of the university. Following the end of free university education, the event has toned down in more recent times as a result of increased work commitments by students and the rise of social media for activism. Prosh week winds up with the Prosh After Dark social event in the UniBar which has its origins from the Prosh Ball.

===Student newspapers and radio===
&quot;On Dit&quot; (pronounced &quot;on-dee&quot;), the second-oldest student-run print media in Australia, was established by the student union in 1932. It is named after the French expression &quot;we say&quot; and operates independently of the university. It also occasionally uses the name &quot;Hearsay&quot; as a creative writing edition of the magazine that dates back to 1972 when the then-newspaper changed its name to &quot;Heresay&quot; in Volume 14 as part of a protest against nuclear testing in the Pacific by France. The &quot;Prosh Rag&quot;, which contains satirical content, is another special issue that is sold by students to the public to raise funds for charities. On Dit often publishes content on national and global politics and is an example of student activism at the university. Former writers of the newspaper include politicians Julia Gillard, Christopher Pyne, Penny Wong, Nick Xenophon and John Bannon.

It is the successor to the &quot;Varsity Ragge&quot; which was founded in 1929. It also published news, poetry and comedic works from various student clubs and societies, including the neighbouring Adelaide Teachers College which later became part of the university campus. According to On Dit, the original newspaper failed due to student apathy. The oldest student-run newspaper dates back to 1889 as the &quot;Review&quot;, which was previously ran by the Adelaide Medical Students&#x27; Society.

The &quot;Adelaide University Magazine&quot; was another student-run magazine that began printing in 1918. Following the establishment of On Dit as the official organ of the student union, it renamed to the &quot;Phoenix&quot; in 1935 as a modernist cultural and artistic magazine with literary works including poetry. Following funding cuts in 1940, its editors founded the &quot;Angry Penguins&quot; which was influential in the then-isolationist Australia as a socially-progressive magazine promoting internationalism. The magazine ceased operations after six years, following the Ern Malley hoax that set back modernism in the country. The magazine was later revived on-and-off the following years as the &quot;Phoenix&quot; but published its final issue in 1949. Later attempts by the student union in the 1950s to revive the Adelaide University Magazine as a staff and graduate magazine, rather than one focussed on artistic and literary works, failed.

The University of Adelaide also runs its own official university-run newspapers including &quot;Lumen&quot; and formerly &quot;The Adelaidean&quot; between 1991 and 2016. Other historical student newspapers include &quot;The Torch&quot; and &quot;Flambeau&quot;, also associated with the affiliated Adelaide Teachers College which later merged with the university.

The university founded Radio Adelaide, Australia&#x27;s first community radio channel, in 1972 and operated it until 2016. Adelaide University Student Radio was established in 1975 and was the oldest student-run radio program in Australia.

===Sports and athletics===

Established in 1896, Adelaide University Sport has 37 sports clubs, including some that predate its establishment. Its historical motto is &quot;Mobilitate Vigemus&quot; translated &quot;we thrive by mobility&quot;. Its sporting colours black and white are likely from the white-backed magpie, an Australian bird found on its crest and the state badge. Its mascot is Gus, a black lion, which replaced the piping shrike on its historical crest.

The Adelaide University Boat Club was founded in 1881 and operates from the River Torrens in the Adelaide city centre and from West Lakes. Its primary boat shed was donated by Robert Barr Smith in 1909. The club claims to be the second-oldest in Australia, though this claim is disputed with the Sydney University Boat Club who uses the founding date of the Sydney Rowing Club. Each year the club competes in a number of events including the Oxford and Cambridge Cup, which was donated by Old Blues of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the 1890s. Several Olympians have previously been members of the club including Collier Cudmore who later became Australia&#x27;s first gold medalist in rowing at the 1908 London Olympics. The Adelaide University Tennis Club was founded in 1885 and is a lawn tennis club. The Adelaide University Lacrosse Club was founded in 1889 by future Nobel laureate William Henry Bragg and is one of the oldest in Australia. It is long-time rivals with the Melbourne University Lacrosse Club.

Following the 1895 establishment of the Adelaide University Union, the student association, the three clubs co-founded the Adelaide University Sports Association in 1896. Additional sports clubs such as the Adelaide University Football Club were established throughout the 20th century. The sports association was administered by the student union for over 100 years before becoming directly affiliated with the university in 2010. The Adelaide University Sports Association renamed to &quot;Adelaide University Sport&quot; that same year.

=== Residential colleges ===
The university did not set any land aside on its main campus for student accommodation due to ideological opposition to the culture of live-in students at the time but also influenced by the small size of the original campus. However, demand for residential college accommodation led to the establishment of private colleges affiliated to the university.

St Mark&#x27;s College was founded in 1925 by the Anglican Diocese of Adelaide and is the oldest of the colleges. It was developed by some former residents of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge among others with the goal of developing a similar collegiate lifestyle.

Aquinas College was founded as a men&#x27;s college in 1950 by the Catholic Church at Montefiore House, the former residence of Samuel Way who was a chancellor and vice-chancellor at the university. It later expanded to surrounding sites and became co-residential in 1975.

St Ann&#x27;s College was founded as a women&#x27;s college in 1947. The college&#x27;s honorary founder is politician Josiah Symon who in 1924 suggested that female students at the university should have somewhere to live. It became co-educational in 1973.

Lincoln College was founded in 1952 by the Methodist Church and named after the Lincoln College at the University of Oxford. Originally established as a men&#x27;s college, it became co-residential in 1973. It features several heritage-listed buildings.

There are also other private student accommodation providers in the city centre and in suburban Adelaide. The university also manages the University Village, Mattanya Student Residences and the Roseworthy Residential College.

==== Former colleges ====
Kathleen Lumley College was a postgraduate college founded by the university in 1965. It closed in 2022 following a drop in overseas students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Notable people==
The University of Adelaide&#x27;s alumni also includes students from past mergers including the Roseworthy Agricultural College and the City campus of the former South Australian College of Advanced Education (including its predecessors the Adelaide Teachers College and the Adelaide College of Advanced Education).

The university has had a significant impact on the public life of South Australia, having educated many of the state&#x27;s earliest businesspeople, lawyers, medical professionals and politicians. It has also produced 117 Rhodes scholars, 164 Fulbright scholars and is associated with five Nobel laureates which constitute one-third of Australia&#x27;s total Nobel laureates. The university throughout its history has been associated with the development of penicillin, space exploration, sunscreen, the military tank, Wi-Fi, polymer banknotes and X-ray crystallography, and the study of viticulture and oenology.

Notable alumni of the university include the first female Australian prime minister Julia Gillard, Singaporean presidents Tony Tan and Ong Teng Cheong, the first Australian-born astronaut Andy Thomas, the first demonstrator of nuclear fusion Mark Oliphant, singer-songwriter Guy Sebastian, the industrialist Edward Holden who founded Australian automobile manufacturer GM Holden, the speech therapist Lionel Logue who helped King George VI manage his stammer, the inventor of modern sunscreen Milton Blake and Neil Weste whose advancements in wireless communications are widely used. Several Olympians and Paralympians have also studied at the university including Matthew Cowdrey. Incumbent office-holders include the state premier Peter Malinauskas, state governor Frances Adamson, the Human Rights Watch executive director Tirana Hassan, the national senate leader Penny Wong, the Australian National University chancellor Julie Bishop and several federal cabinet ministers.

=== Women&#x27;s education ===
Following a royal charter granted by Queen Victoria in 1881, the university became the second university in the English-speaking world to formally admit women to degree-conferring programs on equal terms as men, contributing to a number of firsts in the history of women&#x27;s education in Australia. Its first female graduate was Edith Emily Dornwell who concurrently became the first person in Australia to receive the degree of Bachelor of Science in 1885. The university also graduated Australia&#x27;s first female surgeon Laura Margaret Fowler in 1891. Ruby Claudia Davy was the first Australian woman to receive a doctorate in music in 1918. Other notable firsts also include Winifred Kiek, Margaret Reid and Janine Haines. In 1914, the university was also the first to elect a woman, Helen Mayo, to a university council in Australia. It is also the alma mater of Roma Mitchell who was Australia&#x27;s first female judge, the first woman to be a Queen&#x27;s Counsel, a chancellor of an Australian university and the governor of an Australian state. Australia&#x27;s first female prime minister Julia Gillard had also studied at the university and the first Aboriginal Rhodes Scholar Rebecca Richards in 2010.
=== Nobel laureates ===

Nobel laureates associated with the university include alumni Lawrence Bragg, who held the record for the youngest laureate ever until 2014, co-recipient with his father William Henry Bragg for their work in x-ray crystallography in 1915. Howard Florey, a pharmacologist and pathologist, shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Alexander Fleming and Ernst Chain for their role in the development of penicillin. J. M. Coetzee, a novelist and member of the faculty, had won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2003. Robin Warren was a pathologist who, alongside Barry Marshall, discovered that peptic ulcers were largely caused by the infection &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, graduated from the university in 1961. Warren and Marshall won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery in 2005.

== Controversies ==
=== University merger ===

==== Initial merger discussions ====
The University of Adelaide and the University of South Australia had previously engaged to discuss a merger in 2018 but failed due to disagreements from the latter about the post-merger leadership structure.

==== Opinion polling on staff ====
The National Tertiary Education Union SA conducted a survey of 1,100 university staff and found that three-quarters of respondents were against the merger. In addition, the state government has been accused of coercing the universities to agree to merge, indicating that a commission of inquiry would be established to find ways to compel the two universities to merge had their councils refused to do so, with less financial support available.

Andrew Miller, the state secretary of the union, raised concerns that staff were under &quot;extreme psychosocial pressure&quot; to meet the 2026 launch deadline. Backing his claims with communications from the &quot;Integration Management Office&quot; staff responsible for merging the two institutions, he added that the &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; perception among staff competing &quot;for the final spots of the new Adelaide University&quot; was causing tensions, breakdowns and disharmony. The institutions&#x27; vice-chancellors David Lloyd and Peter Høj criticised the claims, referring to them as &quot;whispers of Little Birds or Littlefingers&quot;, though they had previously admitted that the &quot;two-by-two approach across the board&quot; was &quot;not as linear as first conceived&quot;.

Despite previous polls claiming low support from staff, the vice-chancellors added that the over 3,000 staff who attended the July 2024 Adelaide University launch event were enthusiastic about the new brand identity. They also wrote that criticism should instead be directed towards the proposed caps to international students caused by a national housing shortage.

The post-merger plan to switch to a trimester academic calendar has also been criticised by the union whose internal poll showed that more than 4 in 5 members were against the move. The University of New South Wales had previously also switched to a trimester model, allowing students to complete a 3 year bachelor&#x27;s degree program in 2 years with shorter breaks. As of 2024, UNSW is considering reversing the change following a 40% drop in paid hours for staff, decreased time for non-academic activities and student burnout from increased workload.

==== Land re-development ====
In February 2024, the State Government drew criticism for its plans to convert land it had purchased from two University of South Australia campuses for housing and commercial re-development. As part of the merger agreement, the land was to be sold to the South Australian Government for and leased back to the university for a period of up to 10 years. Following the release of several internal FOI documents retrieved by &quot;InDaily&quot; from the Premier&#x27;s Office, it was later revealed that the land was &quot;earmarked for future development&quot; for residential and commercial purposes.

The original media release replaced the phrase with &quot;short-term transitional lease to university&quot;, referring to the leaseback period of 10 years, following concerns from UniSA vice-chancellor David Lloyd that the original draft would &quot;create enormous community reaction which will be particularly unhelpful at this time&quot;. The land sales account for the entirety of the Magill campus and approximately 50% of the Mawson Lakes campus.

=== Staff conduct ===

In May 2020, then vice-chancellor Peter Rathjen commenced an indefinite leave of absence after chancellor Kevin Scarce resigned without public explanation the previous day. Later in the week, the Independent Commissioner Against Corruption (ICAC) confirmed he was investigating allegations of improper conduct by the vice-chancellor of the University of Adelaide. Rathjen, accused of engaging in &quot;a personal relationship with a staff member&quot;, was succeeded by acting vice-chancellor Mike Brooks. Rathjen formally resigned in July 2020, &quot;due to ill health&quot;. In August 2020, the ICAC found that Rathjen had committed &quot;serious misconduct&quot; by sexually harassing two University of Adelaide colleagues, had lied to the then-chancellor Kevin Scarce, and also lied to the Commissioner in his evidence with respect to an investigation of sexual misconduct with a postgraduate student when he was employed at the University of Melbourne. The ICAC Commissioner Bruce Lander acknowledged there were &quot;further issues&quot; in the full 170-page report on the investigation which he chose not to release due to privacy concerns surrounding the victims, instead releasing an abridged 12-page version &#x27;Statement about an Investigation: Misconduct by the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Adelaide&#x27;. In determining his findings, the Commissioner relied in part on the personal blog of US journalist Michael Balter, who documented Rathjens prior history of sexual harassment, and was largely responsible for bringing the matter to the public&#x27;s attention, and ultimately ICAC&#x27;s. Claiming ill-health, Rathjen formally resigned in July 2020 and, despite the ICAC Commissioner&#x27;s findings, received a large payout from the university.

== Gallery ==
== Tram stop ==

The university is served by two stops on the Glenelg tram line, &quot;University&quot; and &quot;City West&quot;, which connects the main campus on the east with the Adelaide Health and Medical Sciences Building on the west end of North Terrace.

<text>Free River Press is a nonprofit publishing house founded in Nashville, Tennessee, whose mission is to develop a literary mosaic of Americana as written by people from all walks of life. It pursues this goal by conducting writing workshops in farmhouse dining rooms, homeless shelters, small town libraries, senior centers, urban churches and foundations. Its goal is to amass a collection of writings that will eventually resemble a collective American autobiography.

== History ==
Free River Press was founded in Nashville in 1990 by writer Robert Wolf and Steven Meinbresse, former Coordinator of Tennessee&#x27;s Department of Homeless Services. The press grew out of a writing workshop Wolf conducted at a Nashville homeless shelter between 1989 and 1991.

For one year during this period, Free River Press ran a Great Books seminar funded by the Tennessee Humanities Council. The seminar mixed homeless and non-homeless participants.

By 1991 Free River Press had published six slim volumes by the homeless, including &quot;Five Street Poets&quot; and &quot;Passing Thru&quot;. In 1991, Wolf moved to rural Iowa and began a writing workshop with neighboring farmers. Their writings were issued in three books, &quot;Voices From the Land&quot;, &quot;Simple Times&quot;, and &quot;More Voices From the Land&quot;.

During the time he worked with Iowa farmers, Wolf was also traveling to Tennessee to conduct writing workshops there. Subsequently, Free River Press published two memoirs by Tennessee farmers. Wolf later conducted a workshop in Helena, Arkansas and workshops in small Midwestern towns, as well as in New Jersey, New York City, Chicago, Texas, and Santa Fe, New Mexico.

In 1999, Oxford University Press published a sampling from the first nine years of Free River Press books, &quot;An American Mosaic: Prose and Poetry by Everyday Folk&quot;.

In 2009, Free River Press published a second edition of &quot;Heartland Portrait: Stories From the Rural Midwest&quot;, a large anthology incorporating 18 years of writings developed in workshops in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.

== Workshop ==
The Free River Press writing workshop was designed with the amateur in mind. They are unique in that the writing technique is orally-oriented; participants tell their stories before writing them. They are then asked to write their stories as closely as possible to the way they told them, in the style of their storytelling.

== Award ==
In 2006 Free River Press won the Heritage Publication Award for publication from the State of New Mexico for its anthology &quot;Ayer Y Ahora: Stories From Santa Fe and Northern New Mexico&quot;. This anthology included stories by those who grew up in agricultural mountain villages.

<doc id="206753" wikidata="Q627620" url="?curid=206753" title="Trapdoor function">
<text>In theoretical computer science and cryptography, a trapdoor function is a function that is easy to compute in one direction, yet difficult to compute in the opposite direction (finding its inverse) without special information, called the &quot;trapdoor&quot;. Trapdoor functions are a special case of one-way functions and are widely used in public-key cryptography.

In mathematical terms, if &quot;f&quot; is a trapdoor function, then there exists some secret information &quot;t&quot;, such that given &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;t&quot;, it is easy to compute &quot;x&quot;. Consider a padlock and its key. It is trivial to change the padlock from open to closed without using the key, by pushing the shackle into the lock mechanism. Opening the padlock easily, however, requires the key to be used. Here the key &quot;t&quot; is the trapdoor and the padlock is the trapdoor function.

An example of a simple mathematical trapdoor is &quot;6895601 is the product of two prime numbers. What are those numbers?&quot; A typical &quot;brute-force&quot; solution would be to try dividing 6895601 by many prime numbers until finding the answer. However, if one is told that 1931 is one of the numbers, one can find the answer by entering &quot;6895601 ÷ 1931&quot; into any calculator. This example is not a sturdy trapdoor function – modern computers can guess all of the possible answers within a second – but this sample problem could be improved by using the product of two much larger primes.

Trapdoor functions came to prominence in cryptography in the mid-1970s with the publication of asymmetric (or public-key) encryption techniques by Diffie, Hellman, and Merkle. Indeed, coined the term. Several function classes had been proposed, and it soon became obvious that trapdoor functions are harder to find than was initially thought. For example, an early suggestion was to use schemes based on the subset sum problem. This turned out rather quickly to be unsuitable.

, the best known trapdoor function (family) candidates are the RSA and Rabin families of functions. Both are written as exponentiation modulo a composite number, and both are related to the problem of prime factorization.

Functions related to the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem (either modulo a prime or in a group defined over an elliptic curve) are &quot;not&quot; known to be trapdoor functions, because there is no known &quot;trapdoor&quot; information about the group that enables the efficient computation of discrete logarithms.

A trapdoor in cryptography has the very specific aforementioned meaning and is not to be confused with a backdoor (these are frequently used interchangeably, which is incorrect). A backdoor is a deliberate mechanism that is added to a cryptographic algorithm (e.g., a key pair generation algorithm, digital signing algorithm, etc.) or operating system, for example, that permits one or more unauthorized parties to bypass or subvert the security of the system in some fashion.

==Definition==

A trapdoor function is a collection of one-way functions { &quot;f&quot;&quot;k&quot; : &quot;D&quot;&quot;k&quot; → &quot;R&quot;&quot;k&quot; } (&quot;k&quot; ∈ &quot;K&quot;), in which all of &quot;K&quot;, &quot;D&quot;&quot;k&quot;, &quot;R&quot;&quot;k&quot; are subsets of binary strings {0, 1}*, satisfying the following conditions:
* There exists a probabilistic polynomial time (PPT) &quot;sampling&quot; algorithm Gen s.t. Gen(1&quot;n&quot;) = (&quot;k&quot;, &quot;t&quot;&quot;k&quot;) with &quot;k&quot; ∈ &quot;K&quot; ∩ {0, 1}&quot;n&quot; and &quot;t&quot;&quot;k&quot; ∈ {0, 1}* satisfies | &quot;t&quot;&quot;k&quot; | &lt; &quot;p&quot; (&quot;n&quot;), in which &quot;p&quot; is some polynomial. Each &quot;t&quot;&quot;k&quot; is called the &quot;trapdoor&quot; corresponding to &quot;k&quot;. Each trapdoor can be efficiently sampled.
* Given input &quot;k&quot;, there also exists a PPT algorithm that outputs &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;D&quot;&quot;k&quot;. That is, each &quot;D&quot;&quot;k&quot; can be efficiently sampled.
* For any &quot;k&quot; ∈ &quot;K&quot;, there exists a PPT algorithm that correctly computes &quot;f&quot;&quot;k&quot;.
* For any &quot;k&quot; ∈ &quot;K&quot;, there exists a PPT algorithm &quot;A&quot; s.t. for any &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;D&quot;&quot;k&quot;, let &quot;y&quot; = &quot;A&quot; ( &quot;k&quot;, &quot;f&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), &quot;t&quot;&quot;k&quot; ), and then we have &quot;f&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). That is, given trapdoor, it is easy to invert.
* For any &quot;k&quot; ∈ &quot;K&quot;, without trapdoor &quot;t&quot;&quot;k&quot;, for any PPT algorithm, the probability to correctly invert &quot;f&quot;&quot;k&quot; (i.e., given &quot;f&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), find a pre-image &quot;x&#x27; &quot; such that &quot;f&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;x&#x27; &quot;) = &quot;f&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) is negligible.

If each function in the collection above is a one-way permutation, then the collection is also called a trapdoor permutation.

==Examples==
In the following two examples, we always assume that it is difficult to factorize a large composite number (see Integer factorization).

===RSA assumption===

In this example, the inverse formula_1 of formula_2 modulo formula_3 (Euler&#x27;s totient function of formula_4) is the trapdoor:

: formula_5

If the factorization of formula_6 is known, then formula_7 can be computed. With this the inverse formula_1 of formula_2 can be computed formula_10, and then given formula_11, we can find formula_12.
Its hardness follows from the RSA assumption.

===Rabin&#x27;s quadratic residue assumption===

Let formula_4 be a large composite number such that formula_14, where formula_15 and formula_16 are large primes such that formula_17, and kept confidential to the adversary. The problem is to compute formula_18 given formula_19 such that formula_20. The trapdoor is the factorization of formula_4. With the trapdoor, the solutions of &quot;z&quot; can be given as formula_22, where formula_23. See Chinese remainder theorem for more details. Note that given primes formula_15 and formula_16, we can find formula_26 and formula_27. Here the conditions formula_28 and formula_29 guarantee that the solutions formula_30 and formula_31 can be well defined.

<text>The Gila River Indian Community (GRIC) (O&#x27;odham language: Keli Akimel Oʼotham, meaning &quot;Gila River People&quot;, Maricopa language: Pee-Posh) is an Indian reservation in the U.S. state of Arizona, lying adjacent to the south side of the cities of Chandler and Phoenix, within the Phoenix Metropolitan Area in Pinal and Maricopa counties. The Gila River Indian Community was established in 1859, and the Gila River Indian Community was formally established by Congress in 1939. The community is home for members of both the Akimel O’odham (Pima) and the Pee-Posh (Maricopa) tribes.

The reservation has a land area of and a 2020 Census population of 14,260. It is made up of seven districts along the Gila River and its largest communities are Sacaton, Komatke, Santan, and Blackwater. Tribal administrative offices and departments are located in Sacaton. The Community operates its own telecom company, electric utility, industrial park and healthcare clinic, and publishes a monthly newspaper. It has one of the highest rates of Type 2 diabetes in the world, around 50% of the population. The community voluntarily contributes to Type 2 diabetes research, having participated in many studies of the disease.

==Government==
Under their constitution, tribal members elect a governor and lieutenant governor at-large. They also elect 16 council members, from single-member districts or sub-districts with roughly equal populations.

===Lone Butte Ranch===
Lone Butte Ranch () is a populated place situated in the community. It has an estimated elevation of above sea level.

==Transportation==
The community owns and operates Gila River Memorial Airport, a small, private-use airport, located 4 miles southwest of the central business district of Chandler. It was used for cropdusting and air charter operations, with no scheduled commercial services. The airport is no longer used and is in a state of total abandonment.
The community also operates Gila River Transit, a public transit system serving all seven districts.

I-10 was built through the southeast to north-central portion of Gila River lands, bringing significant highway traffic through the area.

==Laws==
The &quot;Constitution and Bylaws of the Gila River Indian Community of Arizona&quot; was ratified by the tribe January 22, 1960, and approved by the US Secretary of the Interior on March 17, 1960. It is available online.

The current Gila River legal code was enacted in 2009. Amendments enacted 15 May 2013, are available online.

===Marriage law===
Gila River does not recognize marriages performed elsewhere in the state of Arizona. On 15 July 2015, in response to the &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage in the United States, the Community Council passed a motion by a vote of 14 to 2 that the gendered language of the Gila River marriage code meant that same-sex marriage was not recognized:
==Notable people==

<doc id="206759" wikidata="Q3118379" url="?curid=206759" title="Disney animators' strike">
<text>The Disney animators&#x27; strike was a 1941 American film industry work stoppage where unionized employees of Walt Disney Productions picketed and disrupted film production for just under four months.

The strike reflected anger at inequities of pay and privileges at Disney, a non-unionized workplace. Walt Disney responded to the five-week strike by firing many of his animators, but was eventually pressured into recognizing the Screen Cartoonist&#x27;s Guild (SCG) by signing a contract with them, which involved, amongst other concessions, rehiring those who wished to return.

==History==
===Background===
In the 1930s, a rise of labor unions took place in Hollywood in response to the Great Depression and subsequent mistreatment of employees by studios. Among these unions was the Screen Cartoonist&#x27;s Guild (SCG), which formed in 1938 after the first strike at an animation studio occurred, the 1937 Fleischer Studios strike. By 1941, SCG president Herbert Sorrell had secured contracts with every major cartoon studio except Disney and Leon Schlesinger Productions. Schlesinger gave in to the SCG&#x27;s requests to sign a contract after his own employees went on strike, but upon signing reportedly asked, &quot;What about Disney?&quot;

Disney&#x27;s animators had the best pay and working conditions in the industry, but were discontented. Originally, 20 percent of the profits from short cartoons went toward employee bonuses, but Disney eventually suspended this practice. Disney&#x27;s 1937 animated film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; was a financial success, allowing Disney to construct a new, larger studio in Burbank, California, financed by borrowing. At the Burbank studio, a rigid hierarchy system was enforced where employee benefits such as access to the restaurant, gymnasium, and steam room were limited to the studio&#x27;s head writers and animators, who also received larger and more comfortable offices. Individual departments were segregated into buildings and heavily policed by administrators.

The box-office failures of &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Fantasia&quot; in 1940 forced Disney to make layoffs, although Disney rarely involved himself in the hiring and firing process with those who were not atop the pay chain. The studio&#x27;s pay structure was very disorganized, with some high-ranking animators earning as much as $300 a week, while other employees made as little as $12. According to then-Disney animator Willis Pyle, &quot;there was no rhyme or reason as to the way the guys were paid. You might be sitting next to a guy doing the same thing as you and you might be getting $20 a week more or less than him&quot;. Staff were also forced to put their name to documents which stated that they worked a forty hour week, while their actual hours were much longer. In addition there was resentment at Walt Disney taking credit for their work, and employees wished to receive on-screen credit for their art.

===Labor action===
The SCG and Sorrell started meeting on a regular basis at the Hollywood Hotel from the start of 1941 to hear Disney workers&#x27; grievances and plan a unionization effort. Many animators, including Art Babbitt, grew dissatisfied and joined the SCG. Babbitt was one of Disney&#x27;s best-paid animators, though he was sympathetic to low-ranking employees and openly disliked Disney. Babbitt had previously been a senior official in the Disney company union, the Federation of Screen Cartoonists, but had become frustrated due to being unable to effect change in that position. Disney saw no problem with the structure, believing it was his studio to run and that his employees should be grateful to him for providing the new studio space.

Sorrell, along with Babbitt and Bill Littlejohn, approached Disney and demanded he unionize his studio, but Disney refused. In February 1941, Disney gathered all 1,200 employees in his auditorium for a speech:

The assembly was poorly received, and more employees joined the SCG. Tensions between Disney and Babbitt reached a peak when Disney began to see Babbitt as having personally betrayed him by becoming a union leader. Disney fired Babbitt along with 16 other employees who were members of the SCG.

===Strike===
The next day, on May 29, more than 200 members of the studio staff went on strike, during the production of the 1941 film &quot;Dumbo&quot;, against the advice of Sorrell, who wanted more time to organize workers before striking. Other studios&#x27; animators, such as those from Schlesinger, offered their support during the strike. Disney retaliated by depicting some of the striking employees in caricature in &quot;Dumbo&quot; as antagonistic circus clowns, and on one occasion even attempted to hit a picketing Babbitt, but was stopped by studio guards. In turn, the strikers maintained a carnival-esque atmosphere on the picket line, using humor and artistic skills in producing signs, and at one stage carrying a mock guillotine in a march and using it to behead a mannequin of Walt Disney. They also received support from other unions, with unionized staff at Technicolor, Williams and Pathé refusing to process Disney films, and consumer advocacy group the League of Women Shoppers picketed theaters exhibiting them. The Disney strikers also extended solidarity to strikes in other sectors, such as producing signs for a United Auto Workers strike at North American Aviation in Los Angeles.

The strike was resolved when the National Labor Relations Board asked Disney to sign a union contract and he agreed. Disney was returning from a goodwill tour of Latin America to produce animated films as part of the Good Neighbor policy, allowing tensions to cool in his absence - although the SCG kept up pressure in the run-up to Disney&#x27;s departure: the union&#x27;s business agent Bill Pomerance obtained details of union leaders in the cities that were on Disney&#x27;s itinerary via the National Maritime Union. He then contacted the State Department to inform them that pickets of Disney and his films were being organized in South America, arguing that &quot;the Disney company (should) comply with American standards of fair treatment of labor&quot; as a condition of Walt Disney being allowed to represent the United States as a goodwill ambassador. As a result the U.S. Conciliation Service brought both sides together in talks in Washington DC: an agreement was struck, which included the reinstatement of employees fired before the strike, equalization of pay, a clearer salary structure and a grievance procedure.

==Aftermath and notable departures==
The strike left the studio with only 694 employees. In addition to Babbitt, the studio lost the following staff:

* Bill Tytla (who later moved to Terrytoons and Famous Studios, although his work is also visible on the 1942 MGM short &quot;The Hungry Wolf&quot;), Walt Kelly, Tyrus Wong, Virgil Partch, Hank Ketcham, Don Lusk, Joey Lockwood, Art Palmer, James Escalante, William Hurtz, Clair Weeks, Moe Gollub, Willis Pyle, T. Hee, George Baker, Hicks Lokey, Stephen Bosustow (who co-founded United Productions of America), Don Tobin, Eddie Strickland, Tony Rivera, Cy Young, Jesse Marsh, Chris Ishii, Aurelius Battaglia, Lynn Karp, Jules Engel, and Frank Fullmer. 
* Kenneth Muse, Preston Blair, Ed Love, Walt Clinton, Arnold Gillespie, Claude Smith, Otto Englander, Webb Smith, Chuck Couch, and Bernard Wolf left for the MGM Cartoon Studio. 
* Frank Tashlin (who later moved to Warner Bros., which had previously employed him as a director from 1936 to 1938), already head of production for Columbia&#x27;s Screen Gems, hired Emery Hawkins, Ray Patterson (who later moved to MGM), Louie Schmitt (later an animator and character designer for Tex Avery at MGM), Howard Swift, Phil Klein, John Hubley, David Hilberman (who later moved to Warner Bros. and co-founded United Productions of America), Zack Schwartz (who co-founded United Productions of America), Phil Duncan, Leo Salkin, Grant Simmons (who later moved to MGM), Basil Davidovich (who later moved to Warner Bros.), Jim Armstrong, Bernard Garbutt, William Shull (later an animator at MGM), Chic Otterstrom, Sam Cobean, Adrian Woolery, and Volus Jones. Bob Wickersham, who left Disney to work at Fleischer Studios before the strike, was also hired.
* Babbitt, Hawley Pratt. Bill Melendez, Art Heinemann, Ray Patin, Phil Eastman, Don Christensen, Jack Bradbury, and Gene Hazelton left for Leon Schlesinger Productions (which would later be known as Warner Bros. Cartoons, Inc. after Schlesinger sold the studio to Warner Bros.). Russ Dyson, Cornett Wood and Maurice Noble would also join the studio years afterward.
* Milt Schaffer, preceded briefly by Couch and joined years later by Hawkins, Pat Matthews, Dick Lundy and Heinemann, moved to Walter Lantz Productions. 

Fleischer Studios (later transitioned to Famous Studios) and Terrytoons are the only major animation studios that did not benefit from hiring displaced Disney personnel immediately after the strike, mainly due to them being located in the East Coast. However, they still were able to gain some talent in the following years, including Bill Tytla, Isadore Klein, Morey Reden, T. Hee and Paul Busch.

In the years following World War II, Lusk, Hee, Jones, Weeks, Marsh, Duncan, Schaffer, Hawkins, Salkin, Patin, Davidovich, Lokey, Battaglia, and Bradbury returned to the studio for varying lengths of time. Disney was forced to rehire Babbitt after he brought an unfair labor practices suit against the studio, though Babbitt eventually left for good in 1946.

Disney never forgave the participants and subsequently treated union members with contempt, arguing in a letter that the strike &quot;cleaned house at our studio&quot; and got rid of &quot;the chip-on-the-shoulder boys and the world-owes-me-a-living lads&quot;. Testifying to the House Un-American Activities Committee, Disney alleged that communism had played a major role in the strike, and many of the participants were blacklisted, including Art Heinemann, an art director on &quot;Fantasia&quot;. Heinemann went out on strike in sympathy with the animators and was subsequently fired and blacklisted, his name removed from &quot;Fantasia&quot;&#x27;s credits.

<text>The Santa Cruz Mountains (Mutsun Ohlone: Mak-sah-re-jah, &quot;Sharp Ridged Mountain of the Eagle&quot; or &quot;People of the Eagle Mountain&quot;) are a mountain range in central and Northern California, United States, constituting a part of the Pacific Coast Ranges. They form a ridge down the San Francisco Peninsula, south of San Francisco. They separate the Pacific Ocean from the San Francisco Bay and the Santa Clara Valley, and continue south to the Central Coast, bordering Monterey Bay and ending at the Salinas Valley. The range passes through the counties of San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz, with the Pajaro River forming the southern boundary.

==Geography==

The northernmost portion of the Santa Cruz Mountains, north of Half Moon Bay Road (SR 92), is known as Montara Mountain; the middle portion is the Sierra Morena, which includes a summit called Sierra Morena, and extends south to a gap at Lexington Reservoir; south of the gap, the mountain range is known as the Sierra Azul.
The highest point in the range is Loma Prieta, west of Morgan Hill, with a height of , near the epicenter of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Other major peaks include Mount Umunhum at , Mount Thayer at , Mount Bielawski at , El Sombroso at , Eagle Rock at , Black Mountain at , and Sierra Morena at . The San Andreas Fault runs along or near the ridge line throughout the range. The interior east side of the mountains drops abruptly towards this fault line, especially near the towns of Woodside and Saratoga.
For much of the San Francisco Peninsula, State Route 35 (SR 35) runs along the ridge, and is known as &quot;Skyline Boulevard&quot;, while Interstate 280 runs east of the ridges. The major routes across the mountains are (from north to south): SR 92 from Half Moon Bay to San Mateo, SR 84 from San Gregorio to Redwood City, SR 9 from Santa Cruz to Saratoga, SR 17 from Santa Cruz to Los Gatos, SR 152 from Watsonville to Gilroy, SR 129 from Watsonville to San Juan Bautista, and US Highway 101 from Salinas to Gilroy. Meanwhile, SR 1 runs parallel to the mountains from Daly City to Castroville while SR 85 runs parallel from Cupertino to San Jose.
There are over 30 wineries located in this region and the Santa Cruz Mountains have been a legally defined American Viticultural Area (AVA) since 1981. Wine has been produced here since at least the 1840s. The Santa Cruz Mountain AVA emerged as a premier producer of top wines as recognized in the historic Judgment of Paris wine competition on May 24, 1976.

==Geology==
The Santa Cruz Mountains are largely the result of compressive uplift caused by a leftward bend of the San Andreas Fault. The Salinian Block basement rocks are overlain by Miocene rock strata of the Lompico Sandstone, the Vaqueros Sandstone and the Santa Margarita Formation.

==Ecology==
The Santa Cruz Mountains are a region of great biological diversity, encompassing cool, moist coastal ecosystems as well as warm, dry chaparral. Much of the area in the Santa Cruz mountains is temperate rainforest. In valleys and moist ocean-facing slopes some of the southernmost coast redwoods grow, along with coast Douglas-fir. Coast live oak, Pacific madrone, Pacific wax myrtle, big leaf maple, California bay laurel, and California black oak also occur in the Santa Cruz Mountains. There do exist several small and isolated stands of old-growth forest, most notably at Henry Cowell Redwoods and Portola Redwoods State Parks and one sizeable old-growth redwood forest at Big Basin. At higher elevations and on sunny south slopes a more drought-resistant chaparral vegetation dominates: manzanita, California scrub oak, chamise, and chaparral pea. The rare sandhills habitat supports disjunct populations of Ponderosa pine and several endemic species of plants, including Santa Cruz cypress, silverleaf manzanita, and Santa Cruz wallflower. Spring wildflowers are also widespread throughout the range.

The area welcomes a tremendous number of species of birds. (see: bird list). Black-tailed deer, a subspecies of mule deer are common, as are western gray squirrels, chipmunks and raccoons. Periodic sightings of black bears indicate they frequent the mountains or wander north from Big Sur, where black bears are established . Foxes, coyotes, bobcats, cougars and human-introduced Virginia opossums also inhabit the region but are rarely seen. Rattlesnakes are also inhabitants, mostly in the high, dry chaparral.

There are two potential critical wildlife linkages which could enable species such as puma (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;) and tule elk (&quot;Cervus canadensis nannodes&quot;) to move from and to the Santa Cruz Mountains by connecting to their counterparts in the Diablo Range to the east, as well as in the Gabilan Range to the south. The first is Coyote Valley, which at its northern end, is only wide, a narrow gap between the Diablo Range and the Santa Cruz Mountains&#x27; Tulare Hill foothill in south San Jose, California. The second critical wildlife passage lies between the southern Santa Cruz Mountains and the northern Gabilan Range, and runs from lands between Mount Pajaro and Rancho Juristac, in southern Santa Cruz and Santa Clara counties respectively, south across California State Route 129 and U.S. Highway 101 to lands between Pinecate Peak and San Juan Bautista in San Benito County. The Land Trust of Santa Cruz County has protected the Santa Cruz Mountains-Gabilan Range Wildlife Corridor with the Rocks Ranch in Aromas at the border of San Benito and Monterey counties. Both critical wildlife linkages will require installation of wildlife crossings to enable passage across U.S. Highway 101. The land trust monitored the new wildlife crossing in 2023 for activity at Laurel Curve on Route 17.

==Climate==
The Santa Cruz Mountains have a Mediterranean type climate typical of most of California, with the majority of the annual precipitation falling between November and April. According to the National Weather Service, this totals more than annually. Heavy summer fogs frequently cover the western ocean-facing slopes and valleys, resulting in drizzle and fog drip caused by condensation on the redwoods, pines, and other trees, which sustains the moisture-loving redwood forests. Due to a rain shadow effect, precipitation on the eastern side of the range is significantly less, about a year. Snow falls a few times a year on the highest ridges, and more rarely the higher valleys receive light dustings.

The National Weather Service&#x27;s cooperative weather stations in the mountains have included Black Mountain 2WSW – average annual rainfall , maximum annual rainfall , average annual snowfall , maximum annual snowfall ; Los Gatos 5SW – average annual rainfall , maximum annual rainfall , average snowfall , maximum annual snowfall ; and Wrights – average annual rainfall , maximum annual rainfall , average annual snowfall , maximum annual snowfall . No temperature records were kept at these stations.

The Santa Cruz Mountains are subject to sharp diurnal temperature fluctuations. The highs and low within a 24-hour period are ~20–30 °F apart on average but can be as much as 50 °F apart during heat waves depending on location. There is also considerable variation in temperature from day to day in both summer and winter with shifting wind directions, and fluctuations in the degree or marine influence.

Average winter highs range from the low 60s °F (~16–18 °C) in the coastal valleys to the upper 50&#x27;s °F (~14–15 °C) in the valleys further inland. Average Winter overnight lows are a function of topography and can vary significantly, from an average low of in the valleys to ~42–44 °F (~6–7 °C) in the thermal belts above the inversion layer where cold air can readily drain off the slopes.

Thermal inversions occur primarily during the Winter when cool air sinks and gets trapped in the valleys at night, often leading to frost and occasional freezes. Higher elevations above the inversion layer usually stay mild with frost being a rare occurrence. The USDA has recently re-classified the hardiness zones for the higher elevations as USDA 10a to 10b to reflect the lack of frost at those locations. However, while the higher elevations are less prone to frost, they are also more likely to experience occasional snow accumulations. The valleys in contrast are rated USDA 9b with some locations as cold as 9a due to the lack of cold air drainage.

Summer temperatures regularly reach highs in the 80s °F (~28–30 °C) with nighttime usually in the upper 40s to lower 60s °F (~9–18 °C) depending on elevation, distance from the ocean and degree of marine inversion present. Summer weather is dominated by a persistent marine layer that can vary in depth. When the inversion layer drops below 300–500 feet, the higher elevations are deprived of marine influence and will often be subject to intense heat waves with daytime temperatures in the range and extreme low humidity with elevated overnight lows that offer little relief from the heat. Such conditions can lead to fires that can occur even before the official State of California fire season starts. Examples of such fires include the 2016 Loma Fire, the 2009 Lockheed Fire and the Summit Fire in 2008.

==Recreation==
The Santa Cruz Mountains are home to an abundance of parks and protected open spaces, notable among them is California&#x27;s oldest state park: Big Basin Redwoods State Park. Other state parks include Castle Rock State Park, Portola Redwoods State Park, Butano State Park, The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park, McNee Ranch State Park and Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park with its famous Redwood Grove walking trail. Additional land is protected by the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District, the Peninsula Open Space Trust (POST), the Sempervirens Fund and local county parks districts. Hiking, horse-riding, mountain biking, rock climbing, and backpacking are popular activities. There is one long-distance trail in the range, the Bay Area Ridge Trail, which, while still disjointed, here roughly parallels Skyline Boulevard along the spine of the range. The Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail, which stretched from Castle Rock State Park through Big Basin to the Pacific Ocean was also a popular destination for backpackers, until it was closed due to severe damage by the CZU Lightning Complex Fires in 2020. Very few portions of the trail have reopened, and as of 2024, there have not been significant efforts to rebuild the trail. There also exist several backcountry campsites in many of the state parks that enable long distance multi-day outings. Castle Rock State Park has open rock faces suitable for rock climbing and bouldering.

==Cultural history==
The previous historic Old Almaden Winery was located on the eastern slopes of the Santa Cruz Mountains. It was the first commercial winery in California, planting high quality European (French) varietal vines.

Film director Alfred Hitchcock and his wife Alma had their primary residence, the Cornwall Ranch, near Scotts Valley, purchased in September 1940.

In 1965, science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein constructed a home in Bonny Doon, and lived there until shortly before his death in 1988.

From 1970 to 2014, singer-songwriter Neil Young lived at Broken Arrow Ranch near Woodside with his family. Many of his songs from this time were recorded at the ranch.

<text>Treasure Island is a man-made island in San Francisco Bay, and a neighborhood in the City and County of San Francisco. Built in 1936–37 for the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition, the island was named by Clyde Milner Vandeburg, part of the Fair&#x27;s public relations team. Its World&#x27;s Fair site is a California Historical Landmark. Buildings there have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the historical Naval Station Treasure Island, an auxiliary air facility (for airships, blimps, dirigibles, planes and seaplanes), are designated in the Geographic Names Information System. Treasure Island is connected to Yerba Buena Island, another (natural) auxiliary island of San Francisco, by a causeway, creating access to Interstate 80.

== Geography ==
The San Francisco census tract that includes Treasure Island extends up and down San Francisco Bay and includes a small uninhabited tip of western Alameda Island. Yerba Buena and Treasure Island together have a land area of with – in 2010 – a total population of 2,500. Treasure Island alone is 393 acres. It is connected by a causeway to Yerba Buena Island, which in turn has on- and off-ramps to Interstate 80 on the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge.

The island has a marina and a bikeway connecting to the newly completed Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge. Raised walkways circumscribe nearly the entire island along five streets (Avenue of the Palms, Perimeter Road, Avenue N, Pan American World Airways Esplanade and Clipper Cove Way, formerly known as 1st Street).

== History ==
Prior to the island&#x27;s construction by the United States government, &quot;Yerba Buena Shoals&quot; of rock north of the transbay island had less than clearance and were a shipping hazard. The island was constructed by emplacing of quarried rock in the shoals for the island/causeway perimeter rock walls (a freshwater reservoir was quarried in the rock of Yerba Buena Island). Approximately of dredged bay sand filled the interior, was mitigated from salt, and then topsoil was used for planting 4,000 trees, 70,000 shrubs, and 700,000 flowering plants. Facility construction had begun by March 4, 1937, when two hangars were being built.
On February 18, 1939, the &#x27;Magic City&#x27; opened with a &quot;walled city&quot; of several fair ground courts: a central Court of Honor, a Court of the East, a Port of Trade Winds on the south and on the north: a Court of Pacifica, a 12,000-car parking lot, and the adjacent National Building, the $1.5M Federal Building, the Hall of Western States, the $800K administration building, various exhibit halls for industries (e.g., &quot;Machinery, Science, and Vacationland&quot;), and two hangars planned for post-exposition use by Pan Am flying boats (e.g., the China Clipper through 1944) using the &quot;Port of Trade Winds Harbor&quot; later referred to as &quot;Clipper Cove&quot; between the two islands. In addition to Building 2 (Hangar 2) and Building 3 (Hangar 3), remaining exposition buildings include Building 1 (Streamline Moderne architecture) intended after the expo as the Pan American World Airways terminal. The expo&#x27;s &quot;Magic Carpet Great Lawn&quot; also remains.)

A couplet from the song &quot;Lydia the Tattooed Lady&quot;, in the Marx Brothers&#x27; 1939 film, &quot;At The Circus&quot;, reads &quot;Here is Grover Whalen unveilin&#x27; the Trylon/Over on the West Coast we have Treasure Island&quot;, citing, in the Trylon and Treasure Island, two prominent features of international civic events happening that year (as the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair vied for tourist patrons with the Golden Gate International Expo).

Treasure Island and the exposition are featured in one of James A. Fitzpatrick&#x27;s Technicolor travel features, &quot;Night Descends on Treasure Island&quot;, released in 1940.

=== Military base ===


Treasure Island was originally intended to become a second airport for San Francisco, augmenting the existing San Francisco Municipal Airport, now SFO. But with war looming, the Navy moved in.

Naval Station (NAVSTA) Treasure Island began under a 1941 war lease as a United States Navy &quot;reception center&quot;. On April 17, 1942, the U.S. Navy cut short an ownership dispute with the city by seizing the island. The Navy eventually compensated the city with $10 million in improvements to the existing airport, including reclaiming 93 acres of land, and postwar ownership of all military improvements. (A widely cited Navy report gave rise to the urban legend that the Navy swapped the island for land on which the city then built SFO. In fact, the airport had been operating in its current location since 1927.)

NAVSTA Treasure Island had a Naval Auxiliary Air Facility in order to support helicopters, fixed wing planes, seaplanes, blimps, dirigibles and airships and a U.S.Navy/USMC electronics school. During World War II over 12,000 men a day were processed here for Pacific area assignments, and thousands more were processed for separation in the aftermath of the war. The psychiatric ward of the naval base at Treasure Island was used to study and experiment on naval sailors who were being discharged for being homosexual.

Since before the 1950s, and through the 1990s (throughout both Korean &amp; Vietnam wars) the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Naval Technical Training Center (NTTC) – Treasure Island, was operational. Multiple Maintenance Skills were part of the curriculum there, including training of Electronic Technicians (ET) in Radiation and Detection equipment (RADIAC), Communications &amp; Radar systems, as well as training of Shipfitter and Damage Control Technicians, which also covered Nuclear Biological &amp; Chemical (NBC) Warfare Decontamination (DECON) techniques. In 1972 a new U.S. Navy Rate consisting of the old Shipfitter and Damage Control Technician ratings was created. This New U.S. Navy Rate was Hull Maintenance Technician (HT). The Navy later realized that Damage Control is such a large responsibility, it needed a rating specifically tasked with those duties, hence the reemergence of the Damage Controlman Rating in 1988.

In recognition of his naval base leadership and development efforts since the inception of US Naval Station Treasure Island, Rear Admiral Hugo Wilson Osterhaus Square was established in front of Building 1 Administration Building, Treasure Island. Medal of Honor and Navy Cross recipient USMC Gunnery Sgt John Basilone movie theatre Building 401 @ 680 Avenue I was established in recognition as being one of the earliest World War II heroes.

The station was identified by the 1991 Base Realignment and Closure Commission, and NAVSTA Treasure Island closed in 1997. Remaining military structures included Bldg. 600 @ 750 Avenue M (former Naval Firefighting School, now SFFD&#x27;s Treasure Island Training Facility &amp; Temporary SFFD Fire Station 48), Bldg. 157 (Navy Fire station 2 built circa 1942 wood-frame building which lacks modern earthquake Seismic retrofit) @ 849 Avenue D (SFFD Station 48 closed March 7, 2014, due to health hazards &amp; excessive deferred maintenance), and the Bldg. 180 by US Naval Station Way &amp; California Ave (now a winery).

==== SAC radar station ====
The Treasure Island Radar Bomb Scoring Site (call sign &quot;San Francisco Bomb Plot&quot;) was a Strategic Air Command (SAC) automatic tracking radar facility established on the island. Major Posey was the commander of Detachment B (Capt Carlson on August 1, 1949) which evaluated simulated bombing missions on targets in the San Francisco metropolitan area for maintaining Cold War bomber crews&#x27; proficiency. A nearby &quot;Stockton Bomb Plot (Det I)&quot; moved to Charlotte in 1950, and the Treasure Island unit was redesignated Detachment 13 in 1951, the year 3 other SAC detachments used a nearby staging/preparation area for deploying via the bay for Korean War ground-directed bombing (cf. the Sacramento Bomb Plot at a McClellan AFB Annex in 1951.) On October 16, 1951, Treasure Island&#x27;s Det 13 was assigned under March AFB&#x27;s 3933rd Radar Bomb Scoring Squadron before moving from the island by August 10, 1954, when the 11th RBS Squadron was activated.

=== Film stages and settings ===
From the late 1980s, Treasure Island&#x27;s old aircraft Hangar 2 (Building 2) and Hangar 3 (Building 3) served as sound stages for film-making and TV, e.g., &quot;The Matrix&quot; (&quot;bullet time&quot; visual effect), &quot;Rent&quot;, and &quot;The Pursuit of Happyness&quot;. Treasure Island was a film setting of the 1939 &quot;Charlie Chan at Treasure Island&quot;, 1989 &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; (Berlin airport scene), 1995 &quot;Copycat&quot; (private compound), 1997 &quot;Flubber&quot;, 1998 &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot;, 1998 &quot;Patch Adams&quot;, 1998 &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; and 1999 &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot;. An establishing shot of the 1954 &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; shows the main gate and Administration Bldg 1 to indicate the location of the fictitious court martial. For two years from seasons 3 to 5, Treasure Island served as the site of the &quot;Battlebots&quot; TV show. The offices and penthouse apartment sets in &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; were located on the island during the show&#x27;s production (1996–2001). The island was featured as the base of operations for the prototypers in the 2008 Discovery Channel series &quot;Prototype This!&quot;. Building 180 (warehouse) and Building 111 (former firehouse) on Treasure Island served as film settings for an NBC series titled &quot;Trauma&quot;. In 2018, Treasure Island Museum building served as a mental hospital setting for the Netflix series titled &quot;The OA&quot;. &quot;MythBusters&quot; also regularly shot footage of their various experiments on the island.

=== Remediation and redevelopment ===
Cleanup crews spent several weeks cleaning the island&#x27;s coast from the 2007 Cosco Busan oil spill just a few hundred yards from Treasure Island, and in 2009 the Navy agreed to sell the island to the city for $105 million as part of a redevelopment project. The federal government still maintains an active presence on occupied by the United States Department of Labor Job Corps (not part of the redevelopment). The Job Corps moved in and took over and 13 building facilities just after the US Navy vacated the island. The Administration Building (Bldg. 1) and Hall of Transportation (Bldg. 2) were listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. On June 8, 2011, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors approved new neighborhood development for 19,000 people over the next 20–30 years by Wilson Meany Sullivan, Lennar Urban, and Kenwood Investments. The 2012–2014 US$1.5 billion Treasure Island Development project for up to 8,000 new residences, of new commercial and retail space, of new office space, 3 hotels, new Fire station and of parks. The island&#x27;s gas station pumps and canopy were also removed (the island has a high risk of soil liquefaction and tsunami damage in an earthquake). All island natural gas, electricity, sewer and water utilities are serviced by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. The island experiences several power outages per year. Ground broke on the island&#x27;s ferry terminal in 2019.

By December 2010, Navy contractors had removed of contaminated dirt from the site, &quot;some with radiation levels 400 times the Environmental Protection Agency’s human exposure limits for topsoil.&quot; The contaminated dirt is to be replaced by dirt removed during construction of the fourth Caldecott Tunnel bore. In April 2013, caesium-137 levels three times higher than previously recorded were found (the island hosted &quot;radioactive ships from Bikini Atoll atomic tests and [was] a major education center training personnel for nuclear war&quot;—the USS &quot;Pandemonium&quot; (PCDC-1) mockup had begun nuclear training in 1957.

== Education ==
The island is a part of the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD). Zoned elementary schools serving sections of the island include John Yehall Chin (North Beach) and Sherman (Marina).

SFUSD previously operated Treasure Island K-8 School. In Spring 2004, the SFUSD board voted to close the middle school portion but keep the elementary school in operation. In its final semester of operation, it had 95 students. In December 2004, the district voted to close altogether effective the beginning of 2005. Initially, the Treasure Island Homeless Development Initiative fought to save the school, but after discipline and staffing issues occurred in 2004, the group stopped its efforts. Heather Knight of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote that year &quot;Even people who had fought to save the school earlier this year now admit it&#x27;s no longer worth saving.&quot;

<text>Anna Freud CBE (3 December 1895 – 9 October 1982) was a British psychoanalyst of Austrian–Jewish descent. She was born in Vienna, the sixth and youngest child of Sigmund Freud and Martha Bernays. She followed the path of her father and contributed to the field of psychoanalysis. Alongside Hermine Hug-Hellmuth and Melanie Klein, she may be considered the founder of psychoanalytic child psychology.

Compared to her father, her work emphasized the importance of the ego and its normal &quot;developmental lines&quot; as well as incorporating a distinctive emphasis on collaborative work across a range of analytical and observational contexts.

After the Freud family were forced to leave Vienna in 1938 with the advent of the Nazi regime in Austria, she resumed her psychoanalytic practice and her pioneering work in child psychoanalysis in London, establishing the Hampstead Child Therapy Course and Clinic in 1952 (later renamed the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families) as a centre for therapy, training and research work.

== Vienna years ==
Anna Freud was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, on 3 December 1895. She was the youngest daughter of Sigmund Freud and Martha Bernays. She grew up in &quot;comfortable bourgeois circumstances.&quot; Anna Freud appears to have had a comparatively unhappy childhood, in which she &quot;never made a close or pleasurable relationship with her mother, and was instead nurtured by their Catholic nurse Josephine&quot;. She found it particularly difficult to get along with her eldest sister, Sophie; &quot;the two young Freuds developed their version of a common sisterly division of territories, &#x27;beauty&#x27; and &#x27;brains&#x27;, and their father once spoke of her &quot;age-old jealousy of Sophie.&quot; As well as this rivalry between the two sisters, Anna had become &quot;a somewhat troubled youngster who complained to her father in candid letters how all sorts of unreasonable thoughts and feelings plagued her&quot;. According to Young-Bruehl, Anna&#x27;s communications imply a persistent, emotionally-caused cognitive disturbance, and perhaps a mild eating disorder. She was repeatedly sent to health farms for &quot;thorough rest, salutary walks, and some extra pounds to fill out her all-too-slender shape&quot;.

The close relationship between Anna and her father was different from the rest of her family. She was a lively child with a reputation for mischief. Freud wrote to his friend Wilhelm Fliess in 1899: &quot;Anna has become downright beautiful through naughtiness.&quot; In adolescence, she took a precocious interest in her father&#x27;s work and was allowed to sit in on the meetings of the newly established Vienna Psychoanalytical Society, which Freud convened at his home.

Enrolled at the Cottage Lyceum, a secondary school for girls in Vienna, Anna made good progress in most subjects. The steady flow of foreign visitors to the Freud household inspired Anna to emulate her father by becoming proficient in different languages, and she soon mastered English and French and acquired some basic Italian. The positive experience she had at the Lyceum led to her initial choice of teaching as a career. After she left the Lyceum in 1912, she took an extended vacation over the winter months in Italy. This proved to be, for a period, a time of self-doubt, anxiety, and uncertainty about her future. She shared these concerns in correspondence with her father, whose writings she had begun reading. In response, he provided reassurance, and in the spring of 1913, he joined her for a tour of Verona, Venice, and Trieste.

A visit to Britain in the autumn of 1914, chaperoned by her father&#x27;s colleague Ernest Jones, became of concern to Freud when he learned of the latter&#x27;s romantic interest. His advice to Jones, in a letter of 22 July 1914, was that his daughter &quot;... does not claim to be treated as a woman, being still far away from sexual longings and rather refusing man. There is an outspoken understanding between me and her that she should not consider marriage or the preliminaries before she gets two or three years older&quot;.

=== Teacher ===
In 1914, she passed her teaching examination and began work as a teaching apprentice at her old school, the Cottage Lyceum. From 1915 to 1917, she worked as a teaching apprentice for third, fourth, and fifth graders. For the school year 1917–18, she began &quot;her first venture as Klassenlehrerin (head teacher) for the second grade&quot;. For her performance during the school years 1915–18, she was highly praised by her superior, Salka Goldman, who wrote that she showed &quot;great zeal for all her responsibilities&quot;, but she was particularly appreciated for her &quot;conscientious preparations&quot; and for her &quot;gift for teaching&quot;, being such a success that she was invited to stay on with a regular four-year contract starting in the fall of 1918.

Having contracted tuberculosis during 1918, and thereafter experiencing multiple episodes of illness, she resigned her teaching post in 1920.

=== Psychoanalysis ===
With the encouragement and assistance of her father, she pursued her exploration of psychoanalytic literature, and in the summer of 1915, she undertook her first translation work for the Vienna Psychoanalytical Society, translating papers by James Jackson Putnam (into German) and Hermine Hug-Hellmuth (into English). During 1916 and 1917, she attended the lectures on psychoanalysis her father gave at the University of Vienna. By 1918, she had gained his support to pursue training in psychoanalysis, and she went into analysis with him in October of that year.

As well as in the periods of analysis she had with her father (from 1918 to 1921 and from 1924 to 1929), their filial bond became further strengthened after Freud was diagnosed with cancer of the jaw in 1923, for which he would need numerous operations and the long-term nursing assistance that Anna provided. She also acted as his secretary and spokesperson, notably at the bi-annual congresses of the International Psychoanalytical Association, which Freud was unable to attend after 1922.

=== Lou Andreas-Salome ===
At the outset of her psychoanalytic practice, Anna found an important friend and mentor in the person of her father&#x27;s friend and colleague, Lou Andreas-Salome. After she came to stay with the Freuds in Vienna in 1921, they began a series of consultations and discussions that continued both in Vienna and in visits Anna made to Salome&#x27;s home in Germany. As a result of the relationship, Anna gained confidence both as a theorist and as a practitioner.

=== Early psychoanalytic work ===

In 1922 Anna Freud presented her paper &quot;Beating Fantasies and Daydreams&quot; to the Vienna Psychoanalytical Society and became a member of the society. According to Ruth Menahem, the case presented, that of a 15-year-old girl, is in fact her own, since at that time she had no patients yet. In 1923, she began her own psychoanalytical practice with children and by 1925 she was teaching at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Training Institute on the technique of child analysis, her approach to which she set out in her first book, &quot;An Introduction to the Technique of Child Analysis&quot;, published in 1927.

Among the first children Anna Freud took into analysis were those of Dorothy Burlingham. In 1925 Burlingham, heiress to the Tiffany luxury jewellery retailer, had arrived in Vienna from New York with her four children and entered analysis firstly with Theodore Reik and then, with a view to training in child analysis, with Freud himself. Anna and Dorothy soon developed &quot;intimate relations that closely resembled those of lesbians&quot;, though Anna &quot;categorically denied the existence of a sexual relationship&quot;. After the Burlinghams moved into the same apartment block as the Freuds in 1929 she became, in effect, the children&#x27;s stepparent. In 1930, Anna and Dorothy bought a cottage together.

In 1927 Anna Freud and Burlingham set up a new school in collaboration with a family friend, Eva Rosenfeld, who ran a foster care home in the Hietzing district of Vienna. Rosenfeld provided the space in the grounds of her house and Burlingham funded the building and equipping of the premises. The objective was to provide a psychoanalytically informed education and Anna contributed to the teaching. Most pupils were either in analysis or children of analysands or practitioners. Peter Blos and Erik Erikson joined the staff of the Hietzing school at the beginning of their psychoanalytic careers, Erikson entering into a training analysis with Anna. The school closed in 1932.

Anna&#x27;s first clinical case was that of her nephew Ernst, the eldest of the two sons of Sophie and Max Halberstadt. Sophie, Anna&#x27;s elder sister, had died of influenza in 1920 at her Hamburg home. Heinz (known as Heinele), aged two, was adopted in an informal arrangement by Anna&#x27;s elder sister, Mathilde, and her husband Robert Hollitscher. Anna became heavily involved in the care of eight year old Ernst and also considered adoption. She was dissuaded by her father over concerns for his wife&#x27;s health. Anna made regular trips to Hamburg for analytical work with Ernst who was in the care of his father&#x27;s extended family. She also arranged Ernst&#x27;s transfer to a school more appropriate to his needs, provided respite for her brother-in-law&#x27;s family and arranged for him to join the Freud-Burlingham extended family for their summer holidays. Eventually, in 1928, Anna persuaded the parties concerned that a permanent move to Vienna was in Ernst&#x27;s best interests, not least because he could resume analysis with her on a more regular basis. Ernst went into the foster care of Eva Rosenfeld, attended the Hietzing school and became part of the Freud-Burlingham extended family. In 1930 he spent a year at Berggasse 19, where the Freuds and Burlinghams had apartments, staying with the Burlinghams.

In 1937 Freud and Burlingham launched a new project, establishing a nursery for children under the age of two. The aim was to meet the social needs of children from impoverished families and to enhance psychoanalytic research into early childhood development. Funding was provided by Edith Jackson, a wealthy American analysand of Anna&#x27;s father who had also been trained in child analysis by Anna at the Vienna Insitiute. Though the Jackson Nursery was short-lived, with the Anschluss imminent, the systematic record keeping and reporting provided important models for Anna&#x27;s future work with nursery children.

From 1925 until 1934, Anna was the Secretary of the International Psychoanalytical Association while she continued her child analysis practice and contributed to seminars and conferences on the subject. In 1935, she became director of the Vienna Psychoanalytical Training Institute and the following year she published her influential study of the &quot;ways and means by which the ego wards off depression, displeasure and anxiety&quot;, &quot;The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence&quot;. It became a founding work of ego psychology and established Freud&#x27;s reputation as a pioneering theoretician.

== London years ==
In 1938, following the Anschluss in which Nazi Germany occupied Austria, Anna was taken to Gestapo headquarters in Vienna for questioning on the activities of the International Psychoanalytical Association. Unknown to her father, she and her brother Martin had obtained Veronal from Max Schur, the family doctor, in sufficient quantities to commit suicide if faced with torture or internment. However, she survived her interrogation ordeal and returned to the family home. After her father had reluctantly accepted the urgent need to leave Vienna, she set about organizing the complex immigration process for the family in liaison with Ernest Jones, the then President of the International Psychoanalytical Association, who secured the immigration permits that eventually led to the family establishing their new home in London at 20 Maresfield Gardens, Hampstead.

In 1941 Freud and Burlingham collaborated in establishing the Hampstead War Nursery for children whose lives had been disrupted by the war. Premises were acquired in Hampstead, North London and in Essex to provide education and residential care with mothers encouraged to visit as often as practicable. Many for the staff were recruited from the exiled Austro-German diaspora. Lectures and seminars on psychoanalytic theory and practice were regular features of staff training. Freud and Burlingham went on to publish a series of observational studies on child development based on the work of the Nursery with a focus on the impact of stress on children and their capacity to find substitute affections among peers in the absence of their parents. The Bulldog Banks Home, run on similar lines to the Nursery, was established after the war for a group of children who had survived the concentration camps. Building on and developing their war-time work with children, Freud and Burlingham established the Hampstead Child Therapy Course and Clinic (now the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families) in 1952 as a centre for therapy, training and research work.

During the war years the hostility between Anna Freud and Melanie Klein and their respective followers in the British Psychoanalytic Society (BPS) grew more intense. Their disagreements, which dated back to the 1920s, centered around the theory of the genesis of the super-ego and the consequent clinical approach to the pre-Oedipal child; Klein argued for play as an equivalent to free association in adult analyses. Anna Freud opposed any such equivalence, proposing an educative intervention with the child until an appropriate level of ego development was reached at the Oedipal stage. Klein held this to be a collusive inhibition of analytical work with the child. To avoid a terminal split in the BPS Ernest Jones, its president, chaired a number of &quot;extraordinary business meetings&quot; with the aim of defusing the conflict, and these continued during the war years. The meetings, which became known as the Controversial Discussions, were established on a more regular basis from 1942. In 1944 there finally emerged a compromise agreement which established parallel training courses, providing options to satisfy the concerns of the rival groups that had formed which by then, in addition to the followers of Freud and Klein, included a non-aligned group of Middle or Independent Group analysts. It was agreed further that all the key policy-making committees of the BPS should have representatives from the three groups.

From the 1950s until the end of her life Freud travelled regularly to the United States to lecture, teach and visit friends. During the 1970s she was concerned with the problems of emotionally deprived and socially disadvantaged children, and she studied deviations and delays in development. At Yale Law School, she taught seminars on crime and the family: this led to a transatlantic collaboration with Joseph Goldstein and Albert J. Solnit on children&#x27;s needs and the law, published in three volumes as &quot;Beyond the Best Interests of the Child&quot; (1973), &quot;Before the Best Interests of the Child&quot; (1979), and &quot;In the Best Interests of the Child&quot; (1986). Freud also used her visits to raise funds for the expanding work of the Hampstead Clinic and was able to secure funding from the National Institute of Mental Health. The Clinic was also the beneficiary of a substantial bequest from the estate of Marilyn Monroe who had left money to her New York analyst, Marianne Kris, with the instruction to allocate it to support psychological clinical and research work through a charity of her choice.

The 1970s were also a time of emotional stress for Freud as she endured a number of bereavements involving family members and close colleagues. Her favourite brother, Ernst, died in April 1970 while she was in America. In the following months she lost two of her American cousins, Henry Freud and Rosie Waldinger, and colleagues Heinz Hartmann and Max Schur. She had further distress following the deaths of her partner Dorothy Burlingham&#x27;s eldest son and daughter, both of whom had had extensive period of analysis with her as children in Vienna and as adults in London. Robert Burlingham died in February 1970 of heart disease after a long period of depression. In 1974 Burlingham&#x27;s daughter Mabbie arrived in London from her New York home seeking further analysis with Anna, notwithstanding the latter&#x27;s advice to continue in analysis with her New York analyst. Whilst at the family home in Hampstead she took an overdose of sleeping pills, and died in hospital three days later.

Freud was naturalised as a British subject on 22 July 1946. She was elected as a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1959 and in 1973 she was made an Honorary President of the International Psychoanalytic Association. In 1967 she was awarded the CBE.

Freud died in London on 9 October 1982. She was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium and her ashes placed in the &quot;Freud Corner&quot; next to her parents&#x27; ancient Greek funeral urn. Her life-partner Dorothy Burlingham and several other members of the Freud family also rest there. In 1986 her London home of forty years was transformed, according to her wishes, into the Freud Museum, dedicated to the memory of her father.

In 2002 Freud was honoured with a blue plaque, by English Heritage, at 20 Maresfield Gardens, Hampstead in London, her home between 1938 and 1982.

== Sexuality ==
In the context of her intimate friendships with Lou Andreas-Salome and in particular with Dorothy Burlingham, with whom she formed a life-long partnership, questions have been raised in relation to Anna Freud&#x27;s sexuality, notwithstanding the absence of any evidence of, and her denials of, any sexual relationships. The historian of psychoanalysis Élisabeth Roudinesco argues that it was repression of her homoerotic sexuality that influenced her in the pathologising of homosexuality in her clinical work as well as in her prominent advocacy of the policy of the International Psychoanalytical Association which debarred homosexuals as candidates for training as psychoanalysts.

==Contributions to psychoanalysis==

Anna Freud was a prolific writer, contributing articles on psychoanalysis to many different publications throughout her lifetime. Her first publication was titled, &quot;An Introduction to Psychoanalysis: Lectures for Child Analysts and Teachers 1922–1935&quot;, and was the result of four different lectures she was delivering at the time, to teachers and caretakers of young children in Vienna.

Anna Freud&#x27;s first article &quot;Beating Fantasies and Daydreams&quot; (1922), &quot;drew in part on her own inner life, but th[at] ... made her contribution no less scientific&quot;. In it she explained how, &quot;Daydreaming, which consciously may be designed to suppress masturbation, is mainly unconsciously an elaboration of the original masturbatory fantasies&quot;. Her father, Sigmund Freud, had earlier covered very similar ground in &quot;A Child is Being Beaten&quot; – &quot;they both used material from her analysis as clinical illustration in their sometimes complementary papers&quot; – in which he highlighted a female case where &quot;an elaborate superstructure of day-dreams, which was of great significance for the life of the person concerned, had grown up over the masochistic beating-phantasy ... [one] which almost rose to the level of a work of art&quot;.

Her views on child development, which she expounded in 1927 in her first book, &quot;An Introduction to the Technique of Child Analysis&quot;, clashed with those of Melanie Klein, &quot;[who] was departing from the developmental schedule that Freud, and his analyst daughter, found most plausible&quot;. In particular, Anna Freud&#x27;s belief that &quot;In children&#x27;s analysis, the transference plays a different role ... and the analyst not only &#x27;represents mother&#x27; but is still an original second mother in the life of the child&quot;. became something of an orthodoxy over much of the psychoanalytic world.

For her next major work in 1936, &quot;The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence&quot;, a classic monograph on ego psychology and defense mechanisms, Anna Freud drew on her own clinical experience, but relied on her father&#x27;s writings as the principal and authoritative source of her theoretical insights. Here her &quot;cataloguing of regression, repression, reaction formation, isolation, undoing, projection, introjection, turning against the self, reversal and sublimation&quot; helped establish the importance of the ego functions and the concept of defence mechanisms, continuing the greater emphasis on the ego than that to be found in the work of her father – &quot;We should like to learn more about the ego&quot; – during his final decades.

Special attention was paid in it to later childhood and adolescent developments – &quot;I have always been more attracted to the latency period than the pre-Oedipal phases&quot; – emphasizing how the &quot;increased intellectual, scientific, and philosophical interests of this period represent attempts at mastering the drives&quot;. The problem posed in adolescence by physiological maturation has been stated forcefully by Anna Freud: &quot;Aggressive impulses are intensified to the point of complete unruliness, hunger becomes voracity... The reaction-formations, which seemed to be firmly established in the structure of the ego, threaten to fall to pieces&quot;.

Selma Fraiberg&#x27;s tribute of 1959 that &quot;The writings of Anna Freud on ego psychology and her studies in early child development have illuminated the world of childhood for workers in the most varied professions and have been for me my introduction and most valuable guide&quot; spoke at that time for most of psychoanalysis outside the Kleinian heartland.

Arguably, however, it was in Anna Freud&#x27;s London years &quot;that she wrote her most distinguished psychoanalytic papers – including &#x27;About Losing and Being Lost&#x27;, which everyone should read regardless of their interest in psychoanalysis&quot;. Her description therein of &quot;simultaneous urges to remain loyal to the dead and to turn towards new ties with the living&quot; may perhaps reflect her own mourning process after her father&#x27;s recent death.

Focusing thereafter on research, observation and treatment of children, Anna Freud established a group of prominent child developmental analysts (which included Erik Erikson, Elisabeth Geleerd, Edith Jacobson and Margaret Mahler) who noticed that children&#x27;s symptoms were ultimately analogue to personality disorders among adults and thus often related to developmental stages. Her book &quot;Normality and Pathology in Childhood&quot; (1965) summarised &quot;the use of developmental lines charting theoretical normal growth &#x27;from dependency to emotional self-reliance&#x27;&quot;. Through these then revolutionary ideas Anna provided us with a comprehensive developmental theory and the concept of developmental lines, which combined her father&#x27;s important drive model with more recent object relations theories emphasizing the importance of parents in child development processes.

Nevertheless, her basic loyalty to her father&#x27;s work remained unimpaired, and it might indeed be said that &quot;she devoted her life to protecting her father&#x27;s legacy&quot;. In her theoretical work there would be little criticism of him, and she would make what is still the finest contribution to the psychoanalytic understanding of passivity, or what she termed &quot;altruistic surrender, excessive concern and anxiety for the lives of his love objects&quot;.

Jacques Lacan called Anna Freud &quot;the plumb line of psychoanalysis&quot;. He stated that &quot;the plumb line doesn&#x27;t make a building, [but] it allows us to gauge the vertical of certain problems.&quot;

According to her principal biographer, with psychoanalysis continuing to move away from classical Freudianism to other concerns, it may still be salutary to heed Anna Freud&#x27;s warning about the potential loss of her father&#x27;s &quot;emphasis on conflict within the individual person, the aims, ideas and ideals battling with the drives to keep the individual within a civilized community. It has become modern to water this down to every individual&#x27;s longing for perfect unity with his mother ... There is an enormous amount that gets lost this way&quot;.

<text>Anabasis (; ; an &quot;expedition up from&quot;) is the most famous work of the Ancient Greek professional soldier and writer Xenophon. It gives an account of the expedition of the Ten Thousand, an army of Greek mercenaries hired by Cyrus the Younger to help him seize the throne of Persia from his brother, Artaxerxes II, in 401 BC.

The seven books making up the &quot;Anabasis&quot; were composed . Although as an Ancient Greek vocabulary word, ᾰ̓νᾰ́βᾰσῐς means &quot;embarkation&quot;, &quot;ascent&quot;, or &quot;mounting up&quot;, the title &quot;Anabasis&quot; has been rendered by some translators as The March Up Country or as The March of the Ten Thousand. The story of the army&#x27;s journey across Asia Minor and Mesopotamia is Xenophon&#x27;s best known work and &quot;one of the great adventures in human history&quot;.

==Authorship==

Xenophon, in his &quot;Hellenica&quot;, did not cover the retreat of Cyrus but instead referred the reader to the &quot;Anabasis&quot; by &quot;Themistogenes of Syracuse&quot;—the tenth-century Suda also describes &quot;Anabasis&quot; as being the work of Themistogenes, &quot;preserved among the works of Xenophon&quot;, in the entry Θεμιστογένεης. (Θεμιστογένης, Συρακούσιος, ἱστορικός. Κύρου ἀνάβασιν, ἥτις ἐν τοῖς Ξενοφῶντος φέρεται: καὶ ἄλλα τινὰ περὶ τῆς ἑαυτοῦ πατρίδος. J.S. Watson in his &quot;Remarks on the Authorship of Anabasis&quot; refers to the various interpretations of the word &quot;φέρεται&quot;, which give rise to different interpretations and different problems.) Aside from these two references, there is no authority for there being a contemporary &quot;Anabasis&quot; written by &quot;Themistogenes of Syracuse&quot; and no mention of such a person in any other context.

By the end of the 1st century, Plutarch had said, in his &quot;Glory of the Athenians&quot;, that Xenophon had attributed &quot;Anabasis&quot; to a third party to distance himself as a subject from himself as a writer. While the attribution to Themistogenes has been raised many times, the view of most scholars aligns substantially with that of Plutarch and certainly that all the volumes were written by Xenophon himself.

==Content==

Xenophon accompanied the Ten Thousand (words that Xenophon does not use), a large army of Greek mercenaries hired by Cyrus the Younger, who intended to seize the throne of Persia from his brother, Artaxerxes II. Although Cyrus&#x27; mixed army fought to a tactical victory at Cunaxa in Babylon (401 BC), Cyrus was killed, rendering the actions of the Greeks irrelevant and the expedition a failure.

Stranded deep in Persia, the Spartan general Clearchus and the other Greek senior officers were then killed or captured by treachery on the part of the Persian satrap Tissaphernes. Xenophon, one of three remaining leaders elected by the soldiers, played an instrumental role in encouraging the 10,000 to march north across foodless deserts and snow-filled mountain passes, towards the Black Sea and the comparative security of its Greek coastal cities. Abandoned in northern Mesopotamia, without supplies other than what they could obtain by force or diplomacy, the 10,000 had to fight their way northwards through Corduene and Armenia, making ad hoc decisions about their leaders, tactics, food supplies, and destiny, while the King&#x27;s army and hostile natives barred their way and attacked their flanks.

Ultimately this &quot;marching republic&quot; managed to reach the Black Sea at Trabzon (Trebizond), a destination they greeted with their famous cry of exultation on the mountain of Theches (now Madur) in Hyssos (now Sürmene): &quot;&quot;Thalatta! Thalatta!&quot;, &quot;The sea, the sea!&quot;. &quot;The sea&quot; meant that they were at last among Greek cities but it was not the end of their journey, which included a period fighting for Seuthes II of Thrace and ended with their recruitment into the army of the Spartan general Thibron. Xenophon related this story in &quot;Anabasis&quot; in a simple and direct manner.

The Greek term &quot;&quot; referred to an expedition from a coastline into the interior of a country. While the journey of Cyrus is an anabasis from Ionia on the eastern coast of the Aegean Sea, to the interior of Asia Minor and Mesopotamia, most of Xenophon&#x27;s narrative is taken up with the return march of Xenophon and the Ten Thousand, from the interior of Babylon to the coast of the Black Sea. Socrates makes a cameo appearance, when Xenophon asks whether he ought to accompany the expedition. The short episode demonstrates the reverence of Socrates for the Oracle of Delphi.

Xenophon&#x27;s account of the exploit resounded through Greece, where, two generations later, some surmise, it may have inspired Philip of Macedon to believe that a lean and disciplined Hellene army might be relied upon to defeat a Persian army many times its size. Besides military history, the &quot;Anabasis&quot; has found use as a tool for the teaching of classical philosophy; the principles of statesmanship and politics exhibited by the army can be seen as exemplifying Socratic philosophy.

== Chapter summaries ==

=== Book I ===

* Cyrus makes preparations to take the throne from his brother.
* Cyrus marches to take out the Pisidians and gains troops as he progresses through the provinces.
* Word spreads that Cyrus might be moving against the king and the soldiers begin to question continuing onward.
* Cyrus and his generals continue marching onward, now towards Babylon. Xenias and Pasion are seen as cowards for deserting Cyrus.
* The soldiers face hardship with few provisions other than meat. Dissension arises after Clearchus has one of Menos&#x27;s men flogged, which leads to escalating retaliation.
* Orontas is put on trial for a treasonous plot against Cyrus.
* Cyrus sizes up the situation for the coming battle against the king. Cyrus and his army pass safely through a trench constructed by the king.
* The battle between Artaxerxes&#x27;s royal army and Cyrus&#x27;s army commences.
* Xenophon describes a sort of eulogy after the death of Cyrus.
* The king rallies his forces and attacks Cyrus&#x27;s army again. Then Artaxerxes retreats to a mound where upon being confronted again by the Hellenes, he and his men retreat for the day.

=== Book II ===
* The army finds out about Cyrus&#x27;s death and heralds are sent to meet the army and ask for them to relinquish their weapons to the king.
* The generals of Cyrus&#x27;s army and the officers of the Hellenes join forces to better their chances for returning home. The Hellenes are frightened by something in the night, which turns out to be nothing at all.
* The king asks for a truce and Clearchus asks for breakfast after establishing one. Clearchus says to Tissaphernes that the Hellenes only followed Cyrus&#x27;s orders when they were attacking the king&#x27;s authority.
* The Hellenes wait for Tissaphernes to return so they can leave. Tissaphernes comes with his troops and the Hellenes suspect they will be betrayed as they progress homeward.
* Clearchus trusts Tissaphernes enough to send generals, captains and some soldiers to his camp. This turns out to be a trap and Clearchus is killed and the generals do not return to the Hellenes&#x27;s camp.
* All of the captured generals are decapitated and Xenophon describes their pasts and personalities.

=== Book III ===
* None of the Hellenes can sleep for fear of not returning home. Apollonides tries to persuade the Hellenes to go to the king to ask for a pardon.
* Xenophon tells the Hellenes to get rid of all but the necessities in order to travel homeward more efficiently.
* After crossing the river Zapatas, the Hellenes are attacked by Mithridates and find that they need better long-range weaponry.
* Tissaphernes comes after the Hellenes with a large contingent of troops. The Hellenes succeed in securing the summit first.
* The generals question their prisoners about the surrounding area and decide which direction to go after having reached the Tigris.

=== Book IV ===

* The Hellenes travel through the land of the Carduchii and lose two warriors when Cheirisophus does not slow for Xenophon on rearguard.
* The Hellenes progress slowly through the mountains with the Carduchii making it difficult to pass through the area. There is a struggle to gain control of the knolls and hilltops.
* Despairing, the Hellenes do not know what to do with the Carduchii closing in from behind and a deep river with a new enemy lying ahead of them until Xenophon has a dream.
* There is a heavy snowfall in Armenia and Tiribazus is following the Hellenes through his territory with a formidable army.

* The Hellenes confront an enemy in a mountain pass and Xenophon suggests taking control of the mountain before travelling up the pass.
* The Hellenes have a hard time overtaking the Taochian fortress. The soldiers finally catch a glimpse of the sea.
* Reaching a populous Hellenic city, Trapezus, the soldiers take a long rest and compete against each other in games.

=== Book V ===
* The soldiers vote to send Cheirisophus to a friend of his who lives nearby to get ships so they can sail home.
* The Hellenes are guided by the Trapezuntines to plunder provisions from the nearby Drilae.
* Cheirisophos returns but without enough ships to take them all back.
* The women and children, and those men who are sick or over the age of forty, are sent back on the ships to Hellas.
* Xenophon speaks of the temple he later constructs to Artemis in Scillus near Olympia.
* The Hellenes become allies with the Mossynoecians and agree to fight their foes together to pass through the territory.
* Xenophon persuades the ambassadors of Sinope into having good relations with the Hellenes.
* Taking the advice of Hecatonymus, the Hellenes take the sea route to reach Hellas.
* Slander is spread about Xenophon and his speech in defence of his honesty to the soldiers results in prosecutions of certain soldiers.
* Xenophon talks his way out of receiving punishment for beating a soldier.

=== Book VI ===
* The Hellenes make a deal with the Paphlagonians to cease fighting. Xenophon feels he should not be the leader on the last part of the trip.
* The army breaks up into three factions and Xenophon leads his troops back to Hellas.
* Xenophon hears of the situation the Arcadians and Achaeans are in and rushes with his troops to their aid.
* The Hellenes do not find the sacrificial victims in their favour and cannot proceed nor find provisions until the signs change in their favour.
* Xenophon advises the troops to attack their enemies now instead of waiting for the enemy to pursue them when they retreat to camp.
* Agasias is to be put on trial before Cleander for ordering Dexippus to be stoned after Agasias rescues one of his own from false accusation.

=== Book VII ===
* The Hellenes fight their way back into the city after learning of their planned expedition to Chersonese. Coeratadas&#x27; leadership falls through when he fails to give out enough rations for one day.
* Xenophon returns at the request of Anaxibius to the army after taking leave from the Hellenes for home.
* Xenophon works together with Seuthes to gain provisions for the Hellenes while Seuthes promises to pay them for gaining land for his control via the pillaged goods.
* Seuthes travels through the countryside burning villages and taking more territory with the Hellenes.
* Heracleides fails to come up with the full month&#x27;s pay for the work done by the Hellenes. The blame is put on Xenophon.
* Xenophon speaks on the charges brought against him about not giving sufficient pay to the soldiers.
* Medosades gains control of the land the Hellenes helped to conquer and he threatens violence if the Hellenes don&#x27;t cease pillaging his lands.
* Xenophon responds that the lack of promised payment and Seuthes attitude will mean a new threat from him and his men if something isn&#x27;t done.
* Seuthes pays a talent of silver and plentiful provisions to Xenophon, who distributes it to his troops.
* Xenophon finally returns home only to find he is wanted to help capture Asidates, which according to the soothsayer, Basias, should be easy.
* Asidates is captured with some difficulty.

==Cultural influences==
===Educational use===
Traditionally, &quot;Anabasis&quot; is one of the first unabridged texts studied by students of classical Greek, because of its clear and unadorned prose style in relatively pure Attic dialect—not unlike Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot; for Latin students. Perhaps not coincidentally, they are both autobiographical tales of military adventure, told in the third person.

Since the narrative mainly concerns a marching army, a common term used in &quot;Anabasis&quot; is ἐξελαύνω (&quot;exelauno&quot;), meaning &quot;march out, march forth&quot;. Throughout the work, this term is used 23 times in the 3rd person singular present indicative active (ἐξελαύνει) and five additional times in other forms. In the late 19th century, a tongue-in-cheek tradition arose among American students of Greek who were all too familiar with Xenophon&#x27;s usage of this vocabulary item: March 4th (a date phonetically similar to the phrase &quot;march forth&quot;) became known as &quot;Exelauno Day&quot;. The origin of this niche holiday is connected with the Roxbury Latin School in Massachusetts.

===Literary influence===
Xenophon&#x27;s book has inspired many literary and audio-visual works, both non-fiction and fiction.

====Non-fiction====
Non-fiction books inspired by &quot;Anabasis&quot; include:

&quot;The Anabasis of Alexander&quot;, by the Greek historian Arrian (86 – after 146 AD), is a history of the campaigns of Alexander the Great, specifically his conquest of the Persian Empire between 334 and 323 BC.

The Akhbār majmūʿa fī fatḥ al-Andalus (&quot;Collection of Anecdotes on the Conquest of al-Andalus&quot;), compiled in 11th-century Al-Andalus, makes use of the Anabasis as a literary embellishment, recording how, during the Abbasid Revolution, an army of ten thousand under a certain Balj marched to al-Andalus to support the Umayyad emir Abd ar-Rahman I.

Shane Brennan&#x27;s memoir &quot;In the Tracks of the Ten Thousand: A Journey on Foot through Turkey, Syria and Iraq&quot; (2005) recounts his 2000 journey to re-trace the steps of the Ten Thousand.

Valerio Massimo Manfredi&#x27;s 2007 novel &quot;L&#x27;armata perduta&quot; (&quot;The Lost Army&quot;) tells the story of the army through Abira, a Syrian girl, who decides to follow a Greek warrior named Xeno (Xenophon).

====Fiction====

The cry of Xenophon&#x27;s soldiers when they reach the sea (&quot;Thalatta! Thalatta!&quot;) is mentioned in the second English translation of Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; (1864) when the expedition discovers an underground ocean (though the reference is absent from the original French text).

The Paul Davies novella &quot;Grace: A Story&quot; (1996) is a fantasy that details the progress of Xenophon&#x27;s army through Armenia to Trabzon.

Michael Curtis Ford wrote &quot;The Ten Thousand&quot; (2001); it follows Xenophon from his childhood until death.

The Sol Yurick novel &quot;The Warriors&quot; (1965) was directly based on &quot;Anabasis&quot;. The novel was adapted into the cult classic film &quot;The Warriors&quot; (1979).

<text>The second USS &quot;Boston&quot; was a 24-gun frigate, launched 3 June 1776 by Stephen and Ralph Cross, Newburyport, Massachusetts, and completed the following year. In American service she captured a number of British vessels. The British captured &quot;Boston&quot; at the fall of Charleston, South Carolina, renamed her HMS &quot;Charlestown&quot; (HMS &quot;Charleston&quot; or &quot;Charles Town&quot;), and took her into service. She was engaged in one major fight with two French frigates, which she survived and which saved the convoy she was protecting. The British sold &quot;Charlestown&quot; in 1783, immediately after the end of the war.

==American service==
&quot;Boston&quot; was commissioned under the command of Captain Hector McNeill. On 21 May 1777, &quot;Boston&quot; sailed in company with and the Massachusetts privateer &quot;American Tartar&quot; for a cruise in the North Atlantic. &quot;American Tartar&quot; parted from the two frigates shortly thereafter.

The two frigates captured three prizes including the 28-gun frigate (7 June). On 7–8 July, &quot;Boston&quot;, &quot;Hancock&quot;, and &quot;Fox&quot; engaged the British vessels HMS &quot;Flora&quot;, , and . The British captured &quot;Hancock&quot; and &quot;Fox&quot;, but &quot;Boston&quot; escaped to the Sheepscot River on the Maine coast. McNeill was court-martialed in June 1779 for his failure to support &quot;Hancock&quot; and was dismissed from the Navy.

During the period 15 February-31 March 1778, &quot;Boston&quot;, now under the command of Samuel Tucker, carried John Adams to France, capturing on 11 March the British letter of marque &quot;Martha&quot; (), which the British later recaptured. She then cruised in European waters taking four prizes before returning to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, 15 October. On 5 May 1778 a Midshipman, Peter Cavee, fell overboard and drowned in port at Bordeaux, France. In 1779 she made two cruises (29 July – 6 September and 23 November – 23 December) in the North Atlantic capturing at least nine prizes. &quot;Boston&quot; then joined the squadron sent to assist in the defense of Charleston, South Carolina. There the British captured her when the town surrendered on 12 May 1780.

==British service==
The British took &quot;Boston&quot; into service as HMS &quot;Charlestown&quot;. In June 1781 Admiral Mariot Arbuthnot sent &quot;Charlestown&quot; and several other vessels to attempt to block some French reinforcements from entering Boston. On 7 July, the squadron that Arbuthnot sent to Boston recaptured the British sloop-of-war , which the American frigate had captured on 27 May. &quot;Charlestown&quot;, under Captain Henry Francis Evans, and , brought &quot;Atalanta&quot; into Halifax. Then &quot;Charlestown&quot; sent in two American privateers that she had taken, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; and &quot;Yankee Hero&quot;.

Next, &quot;Charlestown&quot; took part in the action of 21 July 1781. She was one of five Royal Navy ships escorting a convoy of 13 colliers and merchant vessels. The escorts also included the two sloops-of-war &quot;Allegiance&quot; and &quot;Vulture&quot;, the armed transport , and &quot;Jack&quot;, another small armed merchant ship. The convoy was off the harbor of Spanish River, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia (present-day Sydney, Nova Scotia), or Île Royale, when it came under attack from two French frigates &quot;Astrée&quot;, commanded by La Pérouse, and , commanded by Latouche Tréville, resulting in the naval battle of Louisbourg. The French captured &quot;Jack&quot;. &quot;Charlestown&quot; struck to the French frigates but they were unable to take possession of her; French accounts state that she escaped in the dark. The French lost six men killed and 34 wounded; the British lost some 17 or so men killed and 48 wounded. &quot;Charlestown&quot; alone lost 8 men killed, including Evans, and 29 men wounded. The merchant vessels and their cargoes of coal entered Spanish River safely. &quot;Charlestown&quot; and the sloops sailed back to Halifax.

Lieutenant Rupert George of &quot;Vulture&quot; replaced Evans as captain of &quot;Charlestown&quot;. He was posted on 29 November 1781 and remained her captain.

==Fate==
The Royal Navy sold &quot;Charlestown&quot; in 1783.

<text>The third USS &quot;Boston&quot; was a 32-gun wooden-hulled, three-masted frigate of the United States Navy. &quot;Boston&quot; was built by public subscription in Boston under the Act of 30 June 1798. &quot;Boston&quot; was active during the Quasi-War with France and the First Barbary War. On 12 October 1800, &quot;Boston&quot; engaged and captured the French corvette &quot;Berceau&quot;. &quot;Boston&quot; was laid up in 1802, and considered not worth repairing at the outbreak of the War of 1812. She was burned at the Washington Naval Yard on 24 August 1814 to prevent her capture by British forces.

==Design and construction==

&quot;Boston&quot; was designed and constructed by Edmund Hartt at Boston, Massachusetts. &quot;Boston&quot; was authorized by the funded by the donations from the people of Boston, Massachusetts as part of the group of ships built by the states to supplement the Original six frigates of the United States Navy provided by the Naval Act of 1794.

The frigate had a displacement of 400 tons and a length between perpendiculars of . She was originally armed with twenty-four 9-pounder and eight 6-pounder guns, and carried a complement of 220 officers and men. She was launched on 20 May 1799 and commissioned soon afterwards, Captain George Little in command.

==Service history==
Her first Captain was George Little. &quot;Boston&quot; cruised in the West Indies (July 1799 – June 1800) protecting American commerce against French privateers. 
On 7 November she captured a French barge, of piratical nature that had just captured a French sloop, the sloop/cutter &quot;Le Garde Le Pelican&quot; was then captured by . On 17 November stopped a schooner with questionable papers and put a prize master on board and sent her in to Cape Francois for verification. In company with USS , on 1 December 1799 she recaptured Danish brig &quot;Flying Fish&quot;, captured by André Rigaud&#x27;s barges, but with questionable crewing and other oddities (possibly French owned), and assisted in the recapture of the American schooner &quot;Weymouth&quot; the next day, which had been captured by French privateer &quot;Hope&quot;. Shortly after that she encountered French Navy corvette Diligente, but took no action as she was convoying troops of General Toussaint for the Haitian Revolution, seemingly carrying a US pass. On January 27, 1800 she captured letter of marque &quot;Les Deux Anges&quot;. On 2 March she captured a small boat that was taken into Port Republican and sold. On 4 March off Cape Tiburon she seized cash from French sloop &quot;La Fortune&quot; and let her go. On 11 March engaged 9 French barges, disabling 2 and sinking 3 of them. On 26 March she captured French sloop &quot;Le Heureux&quot; off Cape Tiburon, Hispaniola, she was sunk on 2 April, being old and leaky. On 9 June off Gonaives she captured Danish flagged schooner and sent her for examination as suspected trading with the enemy. On 24 June, in company with USS Augusta, captured a French brig.
On 25 June 1800, she departed Cape Tiburon for Boston via Havana, Cuba. She was at Boston by late July. She cruised along the American coast until departing Boston 19 September when she sailed to the Guadeloupe Station in the West Indies. In , on 12 October 1800, she engaged and captured the French corvette . &quot;Boston&quot; lost seven killed and eight wounded in the encounter. She towed her prize to Boston, arriving in Nantaskett Roads 15 November. During her West Indian cruises Boston captured seven additional prizes (two in conjunction with ).

On 4 March, 1801 &quot;Boston&quot; departed from Boston. She returned to Nantaskett Roads on 27 May, 1801. On 2 July, 1801 Captain Daniel McNeil was ordered to take command. On 6 September, 1801 she departed Boston for New York. She departed from New York on 28 October carrying Minister Livingston to Lorient, France. She arrived at Toulon, France 10 January, 1802, departing for Tripoli on 19 January. She then joined the Mediterranean Squadron off Tripoli. She fought an action with six or seven Tripolitanian gunboats on 16 May 1802, forcing one ashore. &quot;Boston&quot; returned to Boston in October 1802 and then proceeded to Washington arriving 27 October where she was laid up. Considered not worth repairing on the outbreak of the War of 1812, she remained at Washington until 24 August 1814 when she was burned to prevent her falling into British hands.

<text>The fourth USS &quot;Boston&quot; was an 18-gun sloop of war, launched on 15 October 1825 by the Boston Navy Yard and commissioned the following year, Master Commandant Beekman V. Hoffman in command.

&quot;Boston&quot; served on the Brazil Station 1826-1829 and the Mediterranean Station 1830–1832. She was then laid up at Boston Navy Yard until joining the West Indies Squadron in 1836. Except for two short periods in ordinary at New York Navy Yard she served continuously for the next 10 years. &quot;Boston&quot; cruised on the West Indies (1836–39), East Indies (1841-43), and Brazil (1843–46) Stations, returning to the United States in 1846. She was then ordered to join Commodore Conner&#x27;s Home Squadron blockading the Mexican east coast. While &quot;en route&quot; to her new station, &quot;Boston&quot; was wrecked on Eleuthera Island, Bahamas, during a squall on 15 November 1846. Although the sloop was a total loss, all hands were saved.

<text>The IBM 709 is a computer system that was announced by IBM in January 1957 and first installed during August 1958. The 709 was an improved version of its predecessor, the IBM 704, and was the third of the IBM 700/7000 series of scientific computers. The improvements included overlapped input/output, indirect addressing, and three &quot;convert&quot; instructions which provided support for decimal arithmetic, leading zero suppression, and several other operations. The 709 had 32,768 words of 36-bit magnetic-core memory and could execute 42,000 add or subtract instructions per second. It could multiply two 36-bit integers at a rate of 5000 per second.

An optional hardware emulator executed old IBM 704 programs on the IBM 709. This was the first commercially available emulator. Registers and most 704 instructions were emulated in 709 hardware. Complex 704 instructions such as floating-point trap and input-output routines were emulated in 709 software.

The FORTRAN Assembly Program was introduced for the 709.

It was a large system; customer installations used 100 to 250 kW to run them and almost as much again on the cooling. It weighed about (without peripheral equipment).
The 709 was built using vacuum tubes.

IBM announced a transistorized version of the 709, called the IBM 7090, in 1958, only a year after the announcement of the 709, thus cutting short the 709&#x27;s product life.

==Registers==
The IBM 709 has a 38-bit accumulator, a 36-bit multiplier/quotient register, and three 15-bit index registers whose contents are subtracted from the base address instead of being added to it. All three index registers can participate in an instruction: the three-bit &quot;tag&quot; field in the instruction is a bit map specifying which of the registers participate in the operation, however if more than one index register is specified, their contents are combined by a logical or operation, not addition.p. 12

==Instruction and data formats==
There are five instruction formats, referred to as Types A, B, C, D and E. Most instructions are of type B.

Type A instructions have, in sequence, a 3-bit &quot;prefix&quot; (instruction code), a 15-bit &quot;decrement&quot; field, a 3-bit &quot;tag&quot; field, and a 15-bit &quot;address&quot; field. They are conditional jump operations based on the values in the decrement registers specified in the &quot;tag&quot; field. Some also subtract the &quot;decrement&quot; field from the contents of the index registers. The implementation requires that the second two bits of the instruction code be non-zero, giving a total of six possible type A instructions. One (STR, instruction code binary 101) was not implemented until the IBM 709.

Type B instructions have, in sequence, a 12-bit instruction code (with the second and third bits set to 0 to distinguish them from type A instructions), a 2-bit &quot;flag&quot; field, four unused bits, a 3-bit &quot;tag&quot; field, and a 15-bit &quot;address&quot; field.

Types C, D and E are used for specialized instructions.

* Fixed-point numbers are stored in binary sign/magnitude format.
* Single-precision floating-point numbers have a sign, an 8-bit excess-128 exponent and a 27-bit fraction (there was no &quot;hidden bit&quot;).
* Alphanumeric characters are 6-bit BCD, packed six to a word.

The instruction set implicitly subdivides the data format into the same fields as type A instructions: prefix, decrement, tag and address. Instructions exist to modify each of these fields in a data word without changing the remainder of the word.

==I/O channel==
The primary improvements of the 709 over the previous 704 involved more magnetic-core memory and apparently the first use of independent I/O channels. Whereas I/O on the 704 is a programmed function of the central processor - data words are transferred to or from the I/O register, one at a time, using a &quot;copy&quot; instruction - the 709 uses the IBM-766 data synchronizer, which provides two independently &quot;programmed&quot; I/O channels. Up to three Data Synchronizers can be attached to a 709, each able to control up to 20 IBM 729 tape drives and an IBM 716 alphanumeric line printer, IBM 711 card-reader and 721 card punch. This allows six times as many I/O devices on the 709, and allows I/O to proceed on multiple devices while program execution continues in parallel. Up to two IBM 733 Magnetic Drum units, each with 8,192 words of memory, could be attached independently from the Data Synchronizers. The 709 could initially load programs (boot) from card, tape or drum.

The IBM 738 Magnetic Core Storage used on the 709 was also a milestone of hybrid technology. Although the core array drivers all used vacuum tubes, the read sense amplifiers were a very early use of transistors in computing.

<text>The fifth USS &quot;Boston&quot; was a protected cruiser and one of the first steel warships of the &quot;New Navy&quot; of the 1880s. In some references she is combined with as the &quot;Atlanta&quot; class, in others as the &quot;Boston&quot; class.

&quot;Boston&quot; was laid down on 15 November 1883 by Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works, Chester, Pennsylvania, launched on 4 December 1884, and commissioned on 2 May 1887 at the New York Navy Yard, Captain Francis M. Ramsay in command.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Boston&quot; was ordered as part of the &quot;ABCD&quot; ships, the others being the cruisers and and the dispatch vessel . All were ordered from the same shipyard, John Roach &amp; Sons of Chester, Pennsylvania. However, when Secretary of the Navy William C. Whitney initially refused to accept &quot;Dolphin&quot;, claiming her design was defective, the Roach yard went bankrupt and &quot;Boston&quot; was completed at the New York Navy Yard, which had little experience with steel-hulled ships.

As-built armament included two /30 caliber Mark 1 guns, six /30 caliber Mark 2 guns, two 6-pounder () guns, two 3-pounder () Hotchkiss revolving cannon, two 1-pounder () Hotchkiss revolving cannon, and two .45 caliber (11.4 mm) Gatling guns. The 8-inch guns were initially in open barbettes with gun shields added later.

Armor protection was light, with 2-inch (50.8 mm) gun shields and conning tower, and a 1.5-inch (38.1 mm) deck extending over the machinery spaces.

The engineering plant included eight coal-fired cylindrical boilers producing steam and a horizontal compound engine producing driving one shaft. Like the other &quot;ABCD&quot; ships, &quot;Boston&quot; was built with a sail rig to increase cruising range, later removed. The ship carried up to 490 tons of coal, with a cruising range as built of at .

===Refits===
In 1900–01 &quot;Boston&quot; was rebuilt and the 6-inch guns were converted to rapid firing with brass case ammunition replacing powder bags. During her service with the Oregon Naval Militia 1911-16 she retained her original pair of 8&quot;/30 guns and three of the 6&quot;/30 guns, with a single /40 caliber gun added. All armament was removed prior to her conversion to a freighter in 1917.

==Service history==

&quot;Boston&quot;, being the second cruiser of the New Navy completed, was not ready for active service until 1888. She then made a cruise to Guatemala and Haiti to protect American citizens. She joined the Squadron of Evolution on 30 September 1889 and cruised to the Mediterranean and South America from 7 December 1889 to 29 July 1890, and along the east coast in 1891. &quot;Boston&quot; departed New York on 24 October 1891 for the Pacific via Cape Horn, arriving at San Francisco on 2 May 1892. Except for a prospective Pacific Squadron commanding officer&#x27;s cruise to the Hawaiian Islands from 11 August 1892 to 10 October 1893 (in which she provided a shore party in January 1893 that bolstered the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy), she remained on the West Coast until laid up at Mare Island Navy Yard on 4 November 1893.
Recommissioned on 15 November 1895, &quot;Boston&quot; joined the Asiatic Squadron at Yokohama, Japan on 25 February 1896. She remained in East Asia protecting American interests for the next four years and during the Spanish–American War took part in the Battle of Manila Bay on 1 May 1898 and the capture of Manila on 13 August 1898. From 4 October to 23 December, &quot;Boston&quot; and other ships deployed to Taku in China to protect American interests in the wake of a &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; by the Empress Dowager Cixi. Following this, &quot;Boston&quot; remained in the Philippines assisting in their pacification until 8 June 1899. Sometime during this overseas deployment, &quot;Boston&quot;″s distinctive sail rig was removed. This is evidence by a photograph taken in 1899 of &quot;Boston&quot; in the Philippines with pole masts but no cross rigging.

&quot;Boston&quot; returned to San Francisco on 9 August 1899 and went out of commission at Mare Island Navy Yard on 15 September 1899. She remained out of commission until 11 August 1902 and then rejoined the Pacific Squadron. On 7 November 1903, &quot;Boston&quot; was the first ship of the Pacific Squadron to arrive near Panama to support that country&#x27;s newly declared independence; a key event in the creation of the Panama Canal. She then cruised in South America, Hawaii, and the US West Coast. From 16 to 25 June 1905, she helped represent the Navy at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition at Portland, Oregon, and from 23 April – 10 May 1906 she helped care for the victims of the San Francisco earthquake and fire. In April 1907 she carried a Honduran peace delegation that ended the Honduran–Nicaraguan War. She went out of commission again at Puget Sound Navy Yard on 10 June 1907. From 15 June 1911 to September 1916, she served as a training vessel with the Oregon Naval Militia.

With the United States declaration of war on Germany in April 1917, &quot;Boston&quot; was loaned to the United States Shipping Board from 24 May 1917 – June 1918. &quot;Boston&quot; was converted to a freighter by Seattle Construction &amp; Drydock in 1917–1918. Her guns were most likely removed when she was laid up at Bremerton between September 1916 and March 1917. On 18 June 1918, she was recommissioned at Mare Island Navy Yard as a receiving ship and towed to Yerba Buena Island, California, where she served as a receiving ship until 1940. She was renamed Despatch, the sixth U.S. Navy ship to bear that name, on 9 August 1940, thus freeing her original name for use on the new heavy cruiser . From 1940 to October 1945, she was used as a radio school. The old ship was redesignated IX-2 on 17 February 1941. &quot;Despatch&quot; was towed to sea and sunk off San Francisco on 7 April 1946.

==Legacy==
Both of &quot;Boston&quot;″s 8-inch (203-mm) guns were placed at the new Seattle Naval Hospital in 1942. After the hospital closed, the guns went with the site to the new Firlands Sanitarium owned by King County in 1947. At some point after 1952, the guns were moved to Hamlin Park, in Shoreline, Washington. However, county records do not indicate when the guns were placed in the park or why it was done. Of the two guns displayed at Hamlin Park, the easternmost gun bears a plaque which states that the gun fired the first shot of the Battle of Manila Bay. The other bears a plaque crediting the gun with the dismounting of three guns at the Spanish fort of Cavite.

<text>USS &quot;Boston&quot; (CA-69/CAG-1), a heavy cruiser and later a guided missile cruiser, was the sixth ship of the United States Navy to be named for the U.S. city of Boston, Massachusetts. &quot;Boston&quot; was launched 26 August 1942 by Bethlehem Steel Company&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts, sponsored by Mrs Helen Noonan Tobin, wife of the Mayor of Boston, Maurice J. Tobin, and commissioned 30 June 1943.

==Service history==

=== World War II===
&quot;Boston&quot; reported to the Pacific Fleet, arriving at Pearl Harbor 6 December 1943. She joined Task Force 58 (TF 58) in January and took part in the raids on the Marshall Islands in support of the invasions of Kwajalein, Majuro, and of Eniwetok (31 January – 28 February 1944).

&quot;Boston&quot; also supported the assaults on the Palaus and Western Carolines between 30 March and 1 April, and operations at Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura) and Western New Guinea on 21 – 24 April. The ship participated in the attack on Truk, including bombardment of Satawan Atoll between 29 April – 1 May. &quot;Boston&quot; supported the invasion of Saipan between 11 and 24 June. She also took part in several raids on the Bonin Islands in June and July and supported the carrier task forces during the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19 June. &quot;Boston&quot; towed the Cleveland-class light cruiser USS &quot;Houston&quot; after she was torpedoed by a Japanese air attack.

&quot;Boston&quot; returned to the Marianas, to support the invasion of Guam on 12 July, until the completion of the campaign on 15 August. She also took part in the raids on Palau-Yap-Ulithi between 25 and 27 July, as well as the landings on Morotai on 15 September, and the seizure of the southern Palaus between 6 September – 14 October. She also supported the raids on the Philippine Islands, starting on 9 September until 24 September.

She served with TF 38 during the Okinawa raid on 10 October, and the northern Luzon and Formosa raid on 11–14 October, as well as the Luzon raids on 15 October and 24–26 October, 13–14 November and 19–20 November, and 14–16 December. &quot;Boston&quot; also participated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf on 24 October, as well as the Formosa raids in January, on 3–4, 9, 15, and 21 January 1945. Further raids on Luzon took place on 6–7 January, with raids on the Chinese mainland on 12 and 16 January. The carrier task force launched a raid on Nansei Shoto on 22 January, and Honshū and Nansei Shoto raids on 15–16 February and 1 March, in which she bombarded Japan.

&quot;Boston&quot; returned to the United States for overhaul, arriving at Long Beach, California, 25 March 1945. Returning to the Western Pacific, via Pearl Harbor and Eniwetok, she joined TF 38 for further raids on the Japanese home islands (20 July – 15 August), including the bombardment of Kamaishi, Honshū (9 August). Following the surrender of Japan, &quot;Boston&quot; remained in the Far East on occupation duty until 28 February 1946. She then returned to the United States and was placed out of commission in reserve at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 29 October 1946.

===Recommissioned as guided missile cruiser===

&quot;Boston&quot; (along with &quot;Canberra&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot;) was not recommissioned for service during the Korean War as were 10 others of her class, but was earmarked for conversion to carry guided missiles and reclassified CAG-1 on 4 January 1952. In February 1952 she was towed from Bremerton, Washington, to Philadelphia for conversion to a guided missile heavy cruiser by New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey. During conversion her aft 8-inch turret was replaced with Terrier Surface-to-air missile launchers and she was modernized. Boston was recommissioned 1 November 1955 as the lead ship of her class and operated along the east coast and in the Caribbean conducting missile evaluations and participating in fleet exercises until departing for the Mediterranean 23 November 1956. She returned in May 1957.

After making a Midshipmen&#x27;s cruise to South America, taking part in NATO exercises in the North Atlantic, and receiving an overhaul, &quot;Boston&quot; made her second Sixth Fleet tour during June–September 1958. This cruise included participation in the Lebanon crisis. During the next eight years, she frequently operated in the Mediterranean, often in the role of flagship, taking part in exercises off Northern Europe, the Caribbean and off the US East Coast. &quot;Boston&quot; served as flagship for the recovery effort of the Palomares Incident from February through April 1966.

===Vietnam War===
In April 1967, &quot;Boston&quot; returned to the Pacific for the first time in fifteen years, transiting the Panama Canal to begin a tour of combat service with the 7th Fleet. Part of Naval Gunfire Support Task Unit 77.8.9 and Sea Dragon operations off North Vietnam, she fired thousands of rounds of eight- and five-inch shells against targets in North and South Vietnam. Though continuing to be based on the East Coast, the cruiser made two more deployments to the Western Pacific, in April–October 1968 and May–November 1969, the only 6th Fleet cruiser to make 3 tours to the combat zone. In May 1968, &quot;Boston&quot; was reclassified from &quot;Guided-Missile Heavy Cruiser&quot; to &quot;Heavy Cruiser, Attack&quot;, reverting to her original hull number, CA-69. Though she retained her Terrier missiles, the swift advance of technology had made these weapons obsolete after little more than a dozen years&#x27; service, and her main battery was once again her six, eight-inch guns, of her forward turrets.

;Friendly fire incident

On 16–17 June 1968, &quot;Boston&quot; was conducting naval gunfire support against North Vietnamese targets, in company with the destroyers , and the Australian guided missile destroyer , when the group was attacked by USAF aircraft from the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing. The jets fired two missiles at &quot;Boston&quot;. One exploded off the port beam and the other close aboard to port, showering the ship with fragments. No sailors were injured and the missiles caused only minor structural damage. &quot;Hobart&quot; was later hit by three missiles, killing two sailors and wounding eight more. The US aircraft came around for a third attack but were scared off when &quot;Hobart&quot; fired at the aircraft.

Analysis determined that the missiles were AIM-7 Sparrow, designed to be used in an air-to-air role, and not in the inventory of Vietnamese People’s Air Force. Missile fragments found on &quot;Boston&quot; deck indicated they were manufactured in Waltham, Massachusetts, 11 miles west of Boston.

The ships were in the vicinity of Swift Boats PCF-12 &amp; 19, which had come under attack by North Vietnamese helicopters with PCF-19 sunk and 5 killed. The US Navy officially records the incident as friendly fire.

==Decommissioning==
While on her last Vietnam cruise thought and funding was given to overhauling &quot;Boston&quot; (and sister ship ). Her Terrier missile system would have been upgraded to Standard Missile-ER with new radars and equipment for the modern missiles. Her gunnery systems, hull and electronics would have also been overhauled. With the reduction in defense spending, funds were reallocated to more modern ships and &quot;Boston&quot; sailed for a last visit and family day at her namesake city in late 1969 before decommissioning.

Senator Edward Kennedy had expressed views that she should be retained as a museum ship on the city&#x27;s waterfront but no plans materialised so she began the inactivation process at Boston Navy Yard&#x27;s Naval Annex, on the 5 May 1970, was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register in January 1973 and sold for scrapping in March 1975. Scrapping was completed in 1976.

==Awards==
*Navy Unit Commendation
*Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with 10 battle stars
*World War II Victory Medal
*Navy Occupation Medal(Asia clasp)
*National Defense Service Medal
*Vietnam Service Medal with 5 battle stars
*Republic of Vietnam Meritorious Unit Citation

&quot;Boston&quot; received 10 battle stars for her World War II service, 5 more during the Vietnam War and the Navy Unit Commendation for her naval gunfire support during the Battle of Đông Hà in May 1968.

&quot;Boston&quot; was honored with the Republic of Vietnam Meritorious Unit Citation- Gallantry for naval gunfire support and &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; operations during the period 30 July – 30 August 1968 and again for operations, Brave Armada and Durham Peak in June–July 1969.

<text>Laval is a city in Quebec, Canada. It is in the southwest of the province, north of Montreal. It is the largest suburb of Montreal, the third-largest city in the province after Montreal and Quebec City, and the thirteenth largest city in Canada, with a population of 443,192 in 2021.

Laval is geographically separated from the mainland to the north by the Rivière des Mille Îles, and from the Island of Montreal to the south by the Rivière des Prairies. Laval occupies all of Île Jésus as well as the Îles Laval.

Laval constitutes one of the 17 administrative regions of Quebec, with a region code of 13, as well as a territory equivalent to a regional county municipality (TE) and census division (CD) with geographical code 65. It also constitutes the judicial district of Laval. It is the smallest administrative region in the province by area.

==History==
The first European Settlers in Laval were Jesuits, who were granted a seigneury there in 1636. Agriculture first appeared in Laval in 1670. In 1675, François de Montmorency-Laval gained control of the seigneury. In 1702 a parish municipality was founded, and dedicated to Saint-François de Sales (not to be confused with the modern-day Saint-François-de-Sales in Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean).

In 1845, after nearly 200 years being of a rural nature, additional municipalities began to be created. The only built-up area on the island, Sainte-Rose, was incorporated as a village in 1850, and it remained the main community for the remainder of the century. With the dawn of the 20th century came urbanization. Laval-des-Rapides became Laval&#x27;s first city in 1912, followed by , which was granted village status three years later. Laval-sur-le-Lac was founded in the same year and had its tourist-based economy based on Montrealers. Laval began to grow throughout the following years because its proximity to Montreal made it an ideal suburb.

To deal with problems caused by urbanization, amalgamations occurred; L&#x27;Abord-à-Plouffe amalgamated with and Saint-Martin, creating the city of Chomedey in 1961. The amalgamation turned out to be so successful for the municipalities involved that the Quebec government decided to amalgamate the whole island into a single city of Laval in 1965, not without controversy. Laval was named after the first owner of Île Jésus, François de Montmorency-Laval, the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Quebec. At the time, Laval had a population of 170,000. Laval became a Regional County Municipality in 1980. Until then, it had been the County of Laval.

The 14 municipalities, which existed prior to the incorporation of the amalgamated City of Laval on 6 August 1965, were:

Duplessis, in turn, stepped down after just seven months in office after facing allegations of being implicated in a prostitution investigation; he was succeeded by city councillor Martine Beaugrand until the city&#x27;s new mayor, Marc Demers, was elected in the 2013 municipal election.

Past mayors have been:
* Jean-Noël Lavoie (founding mayor), 1965
* Jacques Tétreault, 1965–1973
* Lucien Paiement, 1973–1981
* Claude Lefebvre, 1981–1989
* Gilles Vaillancourt, 1989–2012
* Alexandre Duplessis, 2012–2013
* Martine Beaugrand, 2013
* Marc Demers, 2013–2021
* Stéphane Boyer, 2021–present

On 3 June 2013, the provincial government of Pauline Marois placed the city under trusteeship due to the ongoing corruption scandal affecting the city. Florent Gagné, a former head of the Sûreté du Québec, will serve as the city&#x27;s head trustee, with responsibility for reviewing and approving or rejecting all decisions made by city council. Municipal Affairs Minister Sylvain Gaudreault said that Laval&#x27;s Mayor Alexandre Duplessis and his council will continue to serve, but council decisions must be approved by the trustees. Duplessis, in turn, resigned as mayor on 28 June 2013, after being implicated in a separate prostitution allegation.

====Flag, seal and motto====
On a white-yellow background, the emblem of Laval illustrates the modernism of a city in full expansion. The sign of the city symbolizes the &quot;L&quot; of Laval.

The colours also have a significant meaning:
* Dark red represents the affluence and economic potential of Laval.
* Blue symbolizes the quality of life and the installation of a human city.

The &quot;L&quot; of Laval is made of cubes that represent the development of Laval.

The letters of the Laval signature are related one to the other to point out the merger of the 14 municipalities of Jesus island in 1965.

The logo (that is on the flag) has existed since the 1980s and the flag since the 1990s.

===Federal and provincial politics===


Federally, prior to 1984 Laval had been a bastion of Liberal support. From 1984 to 1993 the Conservative dominated Laval but have not won a seat since.Since the 90&#x27;s Laval has been a battleground area between the Quebec separatist parties (the &quot;Bloc Québécois&quot; federally and the &quot;Parti Québécois&quot; provincially) and the federalist parties (various parties federally and the Quebec Liberal Party provincially). In 2011, amid an NDP surge in the province they swept all 4 seats in Laval for the first and only time. Since the 2015 election the Liberals have held all seats.

Provincially the other parts of Laval have drifted to the provincial Liberals in recent years. While the PQ held every Laval riding except Chomedey (which voted overwhelmingly to not separate in the 1995 Quebec referendum) during their second stint in government between 1994 and 2003. The Liberals won every Laval riding in 2003, 2007, and 2008. During the 2012 election, the PQ saw some gains in Laval when they captured 2 seats, but both returned to the Liberal fold during the 2014 election. During the 2018 election amid a rise of the CAQ, the Liberals held their own in the Laval losing only 1 seat to the CAQ. In the 2022 election the CAQ captured 3 more seats in Laval netting them 4 out of 6 seats and ending the dominance of the Liberals in Laval since the 2003 election. The Conservative Party of Quebec saw its vote share jump from just under 2% in 2018 to third place with just under 13%.

===Public transit===
;Montreal Metro

In April 2007, the Montreal Metro was extended to Laval with three stations. The long-awaited stations were begun in 2003 and completed in April 2007, two months ahead of the revised schedule, at a cost of C$803 million, funded entirely by the Quebec government. The stations are Cartier, De La Concorde, and Montmorency. The arrival of the Metro in Laval was long-awaited as it was first promised in the 1960s. Former mayor, Gilles Vaillancourt, announced his wish to loop the Orange line from Montmorency to Côte-Vertu stations with the addition of six new stations (three in Laval and another three in Montreal). He proposed that Transports Quebec, the provincial transport department, set aside C$100 million annually to fund the project, which was expected to cost upwards of $1.5 billion.

;Commuter rail
The Exo public transit agency&#x27;s Saint-Jérôme commuter train line traverses the island, connecting Laval to downtown Montreal. There are currently three train stations in Laval: De la Concorde (an intermodal station offering transfer to the metro), Vimont and Sainte-Rose.

The Deux-Montagnes commuter train line served the western tip of Laval until it was closed on 31 December 2020. Work is underway to replace it with the Réseau express métropolitain (REM) light metro system.

;Buses

The Société de transport de Laval (STL) provides local bus service in Laval. The STL&#x27;s network consists of 35 regular lines, two rush hour lines, two trainbus lines, three express lines, one community circuit and several taxi lines.

There are reserved lanes for buses and taxis on Chomedey Blvd between Le Carrefour Blvd and the Des Prairies River (Lachapelle Bridge) and beyond as well as along boulevard des Laurentides between rue Proulx and boulevard Cartier (the reserved lane, in this case for buses only, continues onto the Pont Viau bridge into Montreal until the Terminus Laval at the Henri-Bourassa Metro station). Most buses that use the reserved lane end their journey at the Cartier Metro station. The AMT and the City of Laval have developed reserved bus and taxi lanes on Notre-Dame Boulevard between Vincent Massey Street and Place Alton-Goldbloom and another on De la Concorde Blvd between De l&#x27;Avenir and Laval Blvds, as well as between Ampere Ave and Roanne St. These reserved lanes (Notre-Dame and De la Concorde are the same boulevard but change name where they meet under Autoroute 15) opened shortly after 31 October 2007.

==Education==
Laval is home to a variety of vocational/technical centres, colleges and universities, including:

The city has two separate school boards serving Laval: the &quot;Centre de services scolaire de Laval&quot; (formerly the &quot;Commission scolaire de Laval&quot;) for French-speaking students and the Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board for English-speaking students. There is one community English-language high school in the city: Laval Senior Academy, created on 1 July 2015 by the merger of Laval Liberty High School and Laurier Senior High School.

North Star Academy Laval is the only private English high school in Laval. They offer secondary 1 to 5 and the possibility to do a grade 12 diploma from Ontario via their online platform.

==Media==
Laval is served by media from Montreal, however it does have some of its own regional media outlets.

Two radio stations are licensed to serve the city: CJLV 1570 AM &quot;&quot;Radio Mieux-être&quot; (formerly &quot;CFAV&quot;) and CFGL 105.7 FM &quot;Rythme FM&quot;&quot;.

Additionally, there are three major newspapers in Laval: the bi-weekly English-language &quot;The Laval News&quot;, the bi-weekly French-language &quot;Le Courrier Laval&quot; and the weekly French-language &quot;L&#x27;Écho de Laval&quot;.

One television community channel operates on Laval&#x27;s territory, Télévision régionale de Laval, as part of Videotron cable&#x27;s VOX network.

<text>A spirochaete () or spirochete is a member of the phylum Spirochaetota (also called Spirochaetes ), which contains distinctive diderm (double-membrane) Gram-negative bacteria, most of which have long, helically coiled (corkscrew-shaped or spiraled, hence the name) cells. Spirochaetes are chemoheterotrophic in nature, with lengths between 3 and 500 μm and diameters around 0.09 to at least 3 μm.

Spirochaetes are distinguished from other bacterial phyla by the location of their flagella, called endoflagella, or periplasmic flagella, which are sometimes called &quot;axial filaments&quot;. Endoflagella are anchored at each end (pole) of the bacterium within the periplasmic space (between the inner and outer membranes) where they project backwards to extend the length of the cell. These cause a twisting motion which allows the spirochaete to move. When reproducing, a spirochaete will undergo asexual transverse binary fission. Most spirochaetes are free-living and anaerobic, but there are numerous exceptions. Spirochaete bacteria are diverse in their pathogenic capacity and the ecological niches that they inhabit, as well as molecular characteristics including guanine-cytosine content and genome size.

==Pathogenicity==
Many organisms within the Spirochaetota phylum cause prevalent diseases. Pathogenic members of this phylum include the following:

* &quot;Leptospira&quot; species, which causes leptospirosis
* &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot;, &quot;B. mayonii&quot;, &quot;B. bissettiae&quot;, &quot;B. garinii&quot;, &quot;B. afzelii&quot;, &quot;B. spielmanii&quot;, &quot;B. lusitaniae&quot;, which cause Lyme disease. 
* &quot;Borrelia recurrentis&quot;, which causes relapsing fever
* &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; subspecies which cause treponematoses such as syphilis and yaws. 
* &quot;Brachyspira pilosicoli&quot; and &quot;Brachyspira aalborgi&quot;, which cause intestinal spirochaetosis

Salvarsan, the first partially organic synthetic antimicrobial drug in medical history, was effective against spirochaetes and primarily used to cure syphilis. Additionally, oral spirochaetes are known to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of human periodontal disease.

==Taxonomy and molecular signatures==
The class currently consists of 14 validly named genera across four orders and five families. The orders &quot;Brachyspirales&quot;, &quot;Brevinematales&quot; and &quot;Leptospirales&quot; each contain a single family, &quot;Brachyspiraceae&quot;, &quot;Brevinemataceae&quot; and &quot;Leptospiraceae&quot;, respectively. The &quot;Spirochaetales&quot; order harbours two families, &quot;Spirochaetaceae&quot; and &quot;Borreliaceae&quot;. Molecular markers in the form of conserved signature indels (CSIs) and CSPs have been found specific for each of the orders, with the exception of &quot;Brevinimetales&quot;, that provide a reliable means to demarcate these clades from one another within the diverse phylum. Additional CSIs have been found exclusively shared by each family within the &quot;Spirochaetales&quot;. These molecular markers are in agreement with the observed phylogenetic tree branching of two monophyletic clades within the &quot;Spirochaetales&quot; order. CSIs have also been found that further differentiate taxonomic groups within the &quot;Borreliaceae&quot; family that further delineate evolutionary relationships that are in accordance with physical characteristics such as pathogenicity (viz. &quot;Borrelia&quot; emend. &quot;Borreliella&quot; gen. nov.). However, this study has been criticized, and other studies using different approaches do not support the proposed split. The new naming system for the Lyme and relapsing fever &quot;Borrelia&quot; has not been adopted by the scientific literature.

A CSI has also been found exclusively shared by all Spirochaetota species. This CSI is a three-amino-acid insert in the flagellar basal body rod protein FlgC which is an important part of the unique endoflagellar structure shared by Spirochaetota species. Given that the CSI is exclusively shared by members within this phylum, it has been postulated that it may be related to the characteristic flagellar properties observed among Spirochaetota species.

Historically, all families belonging to the Spirochaetota phylum were assigned to a single order, the &quot;Spirochaetales&quot;. However, the current taxonomic view is more connotative of accurate evolutionary relationships. The distribution of a CSI is indicative of shared ancestry within the clade for which it is specific. It thus functions as a synapomorphic characteristic, so that the distributions of different CSIs provide the means to identify different orders and families within the phylum and so justify the phylogenetic divisions.

<text>The Rowland Institute at Harvard, formerly the Rowland Institute for Science, was founded by Edwin H. Land (founder of Polaroid Corporation) as a nonprofit, privately endowed basic research organization in 1980. The institute merged with Harvard University on July 1, 2002. The Rowland Institute is dedicated to experimental science across a wide range of disciplines. Research subjects at the institute includes chemistry, physics and biology, and focus on interdisciplinary work and the development of new experimental tools. It is located on the Charles River near Kendall Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and is a few miles away from the main campus of Harvard.

==Rowland Fellows==
The flagship program at the Rowland Institute is the Fellows Program. The program supports early career experimental scientists. Rowland Fellows receive funding for salary and research expenses and are allocated their own laboratory space. The Rowland Institute also provides technical support from permanent expert staff. The Fellowship lasts for five years, with continuation past two years contingent on a favorable internal review.

==Notable members and alumni==
*Howard Berg - biophysicist noted for his work on the motility of the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli)

<text>In computer software, an operating environment or integrated applications environment is the environment in which users run application software. The environment consists of a user interface provided by an applications manager and usually an application programming interface (API) to the applications manager.

An operating environment is &quot;not&quot; a full operating system, but is a form of middleware that rests between the OS and the application. For example, the first version of Microsoft Windows, Windows 1.0, was not a full operating system, but a GUI laid over DOS albeit with an API of its own. Similarly, the IBM U2 system operates on both Unix/Linux and Windows NT. Usually the user interface is text-based or graphical, rather than a command-line interface (e.g., DOS or the Unix shell), which is often the interface of the underlying operating system.

In the mid 1980s, text-based and graphical user interface operating environments surrounded DOS operating systems with a shell that turned the user&#x27;s display into a menu-oriented &quot;desktop&quot; for selecting and running PC applications. These operating environment systems allow users much of the convenience of integrated software without locking them into a single package.

== History ==
=== DOS operating environments ===
In the mid 1980s, text-based and graphical user interface operating environments such as IBM TopView, Microsoft Windows, Digital Research&#x27;s GEM Desktop, GEOS and Quarterdeck Office Systems&#x27;s DESQview surrounded DOS operating systems with a shell that turned the user&#x27;s display into a menu-oriented &quot;desktop&quot; for selecting and running PC applications. These programs were more than simple menu systems—as alternate operating environments they were substitutes for integrated programs such as Framework and Symphony, that allowed switching, windowing, and cut-and-paste operations among dedicated applications. These operating environment systems gave users much of the convenience of integrated software without locking them into a single package. Alternative operating environments made terminate-and-stay-resident pop-up utilities such as Borland Sidekick redundant. Windows provided its own version of these utilities, and placing them under central control could eliminate memory conflicts that RAM-resident utilities create. In later versions, Windows evolved from an operating environment into a complete operating system with DOS as a bootloader (Windows 9x) and a complete operating system, Windows NT, was developed at the same time. All versions after Windows ME have been based on the Windows NT kernel.

<text>Île Jésus (, &quot;Jesus Island&quot;) is a river island in southwestern Quebec, separated from the mainland to the north by the Rivière des Mille Îles, and from the Island of Montreal to the south by the Rivière des Prairies. It is the second-largest () island in the Hochelaga Archipelago (after the Island of Montreal), and the fourth most populous island in Canada, with more than 420,000 residents as of 2016.

Île Jésus is the major component of the City of Laval, along with the Îles Laval and several other islands. The island still has a considerable rural portion, with most of the urban area in the central region and along the south and west river banks.

<doc id="206805" wikidata="Q207826" url="?curid=206805" title="Time Person of the Year">
<text>Person of the Year (called Man of the Year or Woman of the Year until 1999) is an annual issue of the American news magazine and website &quot;Time&quot; featuring a person, group, idea, or object that &quot;for better or for worse ...has done the most to influence the events of the year&quot;. The &quot;Time&quot; website or a partner organization also runs an annual online reader&#x27;s poll that has no effect on the selection, although no poll was held in 2023 or 2024.

==Background==
The tradition of selecting a &quot;Man of the Year&quot; began privately in 1927, with &quot;Time&quot; editors contemplating the news makers of the year after a series of &quot;slow news days&quot; leading up to New Year&#x27;s Day. The idea originally focused on a Man of the Week before it was decided to use Lindbergh to represent the predominant story of 1927, with the magazine listing him as Man of the Year being published in early 1928.

The idea was also an attempt to remedy the editorial embarrassment earlier that year of not having aviator Charles Lindbergh on its cover following his historic transatlantic flight. By the end of the year, it was decided that a cover story featuring Lindbergh as the Man of the Year would serve both purposes.

Before the online poll was instituted, &quot;readers were invited to weigh in by mail.&quot;

==Selection==
===National leaders===
Since the list began, every serving president of the United States has been a Man or Person of the Year at least once, with the exceptions of Calvin Coolidge (in office at the time of the first issue), Herbert Hoover (the subsequent president), and Gerald Ford (the only president never to have been elected to the office of president or vice president). Most were named Man or Person of the Year either the year they were elected or while they were in office; the only one to be given the title before being elected was Dwight D. Eisenhower, in 1944, as Supreme Commander of the Allied Invasion Force, eight years before his first election. He received the title again in 1959 while in office. Franklin D. Roosevelt became the first chosen US president and is the only person to have received the title three times, first as president-elect (1932) and later as the incumbent president (1934 and 1941).

All countries&#x27; heads of state or government to have been chosen as Man, Woman, or Person of the Year (arranged in chronological order by country name, from the most frequently selected) are:
; Notes
Winston Churchill was chosen a second time for the special &quot;Man of the Half-Century&quot; edition in 1949 while serving as Leader of the Opposition before his second premiership; Charles de Gaulle was chosen while being elected President of France before formally taking office; Lech Wałęsa and Nelson Mandela were chosen before being elected President of Poland and President of South Africa, respectively.

===Women===
Before 1999, four women were granted the title as individuals: three as &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;—Wallis Simpson (1936), Queen Elizabeth II (1952), and Corazon Aquino (1986)—and one as half of &quot;Man and Wife of the Year&quot;, Soong Mei-ling (jointly with Chiang Kai-shek) in 1937. &quot;American Women&quot; were recognized as a group in 1975. Other classes of people recognized comprise both men and women, such as &quot;Hungarian Freedom Fighters&quot; (1956), &quot;U.S. Scientists&quot; (1960), &quot;The Inheritors&quot; (1966), &quot;The Middle Americans&quot; (1969), &quot;The American Soldier&quot; (1950 and 2003), &quot;You&quot; (2006), &quot;The Protester&quot; (2011), and &quot;Ebola Fighters&quot; (2014). However, the title on the magazine remained &quot;Man of the Year&quot; for both the 1956 &quot;Hungarian Freedom Fighter&quot; and the 1966 &quot;Twenty-five and Under&quot; editions which both featured a woman standing behind a man, and &quot;Men of the Year&quot; on the 1960 &quot;U.S. Scientists&quot; edition which exclusively featured men on its cover. It was not until the 1969 edition on &quot;The Middle Americans&quot; that the title embraced &quot;Man and Woman of the Year&quot;.

In 1999, the title was changed to the gender-neutral &quot;Person of the Year&quot; (its first recipient under the new name being Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com). Women who have been selected for recognition after the renaming include &quot;The Whistleblowers&quot; (Cynthia Cooper, Coleen Rowley, and Sherron Watkins) in 2002; Melinda Gates (jointly with Bill Gates and Bono) in 2005; Angela Merkel (2015); &quot;The Silence Breakers&quot; (2017); Greta Thunberg (2019); Kamala Harris (jointly with Joe Biden) in 2020; and Taylor Swift (2023). To celebrate International Women&#x27;s Day in 2020, &quot;Time&quot; editors released 89 new magazine covers, each showing women, in addition to the 11 already chosen, as counterparts to the Man of the Year choices from the past century.

Since 2022, &quot;Time&quot; has awarded a separate &quot;Women of the Year&quot; title to a number of women each year, in a similar fashion to Time 100. 
===Groups and non-humans===
Despite the name, the title is not just granted to individuals. Pairs of people such as married couples and political opponents, classes of people, and inanimate objects have all been selected for the special year-end issue.

Multiple named people
* Chiang Kai-shek and Soong Mei-ling, president and first lady of China (1937)

* Bill Clinton and Ken Starr, key figures in the Clinton impeachment (1998)
* Cynthia Cooper, Coleen Rowley, and Sherron Watkins, whistleblowers (2002)
* Bill Gates, Melinda Gates, and Bono, philanthropists (2005)
* Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, American president-elect and vice president-elect (2020)

===Special editions===
In 1949, Winston Churchill was named Man of the Half-Century, and the last issue of 1989 named Mikhail Gorbachev as &quot;Man of the Decade&quot;. The December 31, 1999 issue of &quot;Time&quot; named Albert Einstein the &quot;Person of the Century&quot;. Both Franklin D. Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi were chosen as runners-up. Aside from Einstein, the December 31 edition also named Persons of the Century for every century of the 2nd millennium: William the Conqueror for the 11th century, Saladin for the 12th century, Genghis Khan for the 13th century, Giotto for the 14th century, Johannes Gutenberg for the 15th century, Elizabeth I for the 16th century, Isaac Newton for the 17th century, Thomas Jefferson for the 18th century, and Thomas Edison for the 19th century.

===Controversial choices===
Despite the magazine&#x27;s frequent statements to the contrary, the designation is often regarded as an honor and spoken of as an award or prize, simply based on many previous selections of admirable people. However, &quot;Time&quot; points out that controversial figures such as Adolf Hitler (1938), Joseph Stalin (1939 and 1942), Nikita Khrushchev (1957), and Ayatollah Khomeini (1979) have also been granted the title for their impact on events. Nevertheless, as a result of the public backlash it received from the American audience for naming Khomeini Man of the Year in 1979, the magazine&#x27;s editors have since shied away from using figures who are controversial in the United States, fearing reductions in sales or advertising revenue.

&quot;Time&quot;″s Person of the Year for 2001, immediately following the September 11 attacks, was Rudy Giuliani, who was then mayor of New York City. The stated rules of selection—the individual or group of individuals who have had the bigger influence on the year&#x27;s events—made Osama bin Laden the more likely choice that year; however, Giuliani was selected for symbolizing the American response to the attacks, in the same way that Albert Einstein was selected Person of the Century for representing a century of scientific exploration and wonder instead of Adolf Hitler, who was arguably a stronger candidate. The selections were ultimately based on the criteria, &quot;who they believed had a stronger influence on history and who represented either the year or the century the most.&quot;

===Withdrawn and alleged selections===
In 1941, the fictional elephant Dumbo from Walt Disney&#x27;s animated film of the same name was selected to be &quot;Mammal of the Year&quot;, and a cover was created showing the title character in a formal portrait style. However, the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 pre-empted the cover. The U.S. president Franklin Delano Roosevelt was named Man of the Year for a record third time, although Dumbo&#x27;s Mammal of the Year profile still appeared on the inside pages of the magazine.

Filmmaker Michael Moore claims that director Mel Gibson cost him the opportunity to be Person of the Year alongside Gibson in 2004. Moore&#x27;s controversial political documentary &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; became the highest-grossing documentary of all time the same year Gibson&#x27;s &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; became a box-office success and also caused significant controversy. Moore said in an interview &quot;I got a call right after the &#x27;04 election from an editor from Time Magazine. He said,&#x27; Time Magazine has picked you and Mel Gibson to be Time&#x27;s Person of the Year to put on the cover, Right and Left, Mel and Mike. The only thing you have to do is pose for a picture with each other. And do an interview together.&#x27; I said &#x27;OK.&#x27; They call Mel up, he agrees. They set the date and time in LA. I&#x27;m to fly there. He&#x27;s flying from Australia. Something happens when he gets home ... Next thing, Mel calls up and says, &#x27;I&#x27;m not doing it. I&#x27;ve thought it over and it is not the right thing to do.&#x27; So they put Bush on the cover.&quot;

U.S. president Donald Trump claimed on Twitter in November 2017 that &quot;Time&quot; editors had told him he would &quot;probably&quot; be named Person of the Year for a second time, conditional on an interview and photo shoot, which he had refused. &quot;Time&quot; denied that they had made any such promises or conditions to Trump, who was named a runner-up.

==Persons of the Year==

== Other categories ==
Every year, in addition to the main Person of the Year, &quot;Time&quot; (sometimes alongside a partner company) acknowledges impactful people or groups in other categories. This is a relatively recent practice, beginning in 1998 when Mark McGwire was awarded the title of Hero of the Year and becoming a regular event in 2018 with the re-introduction of the Heroes of the Year award.

Heroes of the Year was joined by Athlete of the Year, CEO of the Year, Entertainer of the Year and Guardians of the Year in 2019, Kid of the Year in 2020, Breakthrough of the Year, Dreamer of the Year, Icon of the Year and Innovator of the Year in 2022, Team of the Year in 2023 and Community of the Year in 2024.

In line with the introduction of these new categories, &quot;Time&quot; has expanded their annual Person of the Year private event to include and celebrate their recipients. The event, titled &quot;A Year in TIME&quot; beginning in 2023, has been held at Plaza Hotel since 2022. &quot;A Year in TIME&quot; typically features interviews, speeches and performances from some of the categories&#x27; winners, as well as winners of other &quot;Time&quot; awards. Some of these are then posted to &quot;Time&quot; official YouTube channel.

===Athlete of the Year===
Athlete of the Year was awarded in partnership with Oura Health in 2021 and LG in 2022.

===CEO of the Year===
In 2019 and 2020, this selection was called Businessperson of the Year.
===Community of the Year===
Community of the Year is awarded in partnership with Land O&#x27;Lakes.

===Dreamer of the Year===
Dreamer of the Year is awarded in partnership with American Family Insurance.

===Icon of the Year===
===Kid of the Year===
===Breakthrough of the Year===
In 2022, this selection was called Breakthrough Artist of the Year.
===Team of the Year===
Team of the Year is awarded in partnership with Smartsheet.

===Entertainer of the Year===
In 2022, Entertainer of the Year was awarded in partnership with Montblanc.

===Hero(es) of the Year===
In 2020, Heroes of the Year was awarded in partnership with State Farm.

===Innovator of the Year===
===Guardians of the Year===
In 2020, Guardians of the Year was awarded in partnership with Amazon.

==Online poll==
From 2010 to 2022, &quot;Time&quot; held an annual online poll for the readers to vote for who they believed to be the &quot;Person of the Year&quot;. While many mistakenly believed the winner of the poll to be the &quot;Person of the Year&quot;, the title, as mentioned above, is decided by the editors of &quot;Time&quot;.

An online reader&#x27;s choice poll was also held in 1998, with professional wrestler Mick Foley and murdered college student Matthew Shepard as the top vote-getters, although the final result is unknown.

<doc id="206812" wikidata="Q612736" url="?curid=206812" title="Lumen Field">
<text>Lumen Field is a multi-purpose stadium in Seattle, Washington, United States. Located in the city&#x27;s SoDo neighborhood, it is the home field for the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL), Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS), and Seattle Reign FC of the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL). Originally called Seahawks Stadium, it was renamed Qwest Field in June 2004 when telecommunications carrier Qwest acquired the naming rights. The stadium became known as CenturyLink Field following Qwest&#x27;s June 2011 acquisition by CenturyLink and was nicknamed &quot;The Clink&quot; as a result; it received its current name in November 2020 with CenturyLink&#x27;s rebrand to Lumen Technologies. It is a modern facility with views of the Downtown Seattle skyline and a seating capacity of 68,740 spectators for NFL games and 37,722 for most MLS matches. The complex also includes the Event Center which is home to the Washington Music Theater (WaMu Theater), a parking garage, and a public plaza. The venue hosts concerts, trade shows, and consumer shows along with sporting events. Located within a mile (1.6 km) of Downtown Seattle, the stadium is accessible by multiple freeways and forms of mass transit.

The stadium was built between 2000 and 2002 on the site of the Kingdome after voters approved funding for the construction in a statewide election held in June 1997. This vote created the Washington State Public Stadium Authority to oversee public ownership of the venue. The owner of the Seahawks, Paul Allen, formed First &amp; Goal Inc. to develop and operate the new facilities. Allen was closely involved in the design process and emphasized the importance of an open-air venue with an intimate atmosphere.

Seahawks fans at Lumen Field have twice claimed the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd roar at an outdoor stadium, first at 136.6 decibels in 2013, followed by a measurement of 137.6 decibels in 2014. The crowd&#x27;s notorious noise has also contributed to the team&#x27;s home field advantage with an increase in false start (movement by an offensive player prior to the play) and delay of game (failure of the offense to snap the ball prior to the play clock expiring) penalties against visiting teams. The stadium was the first in the NFL to install a FieldTurf artificial surface. Numerous college and high school football games have also been played at the stadium, including the 2011 and 2024 Apple Cups and all Washington Huskies home games during the renovation of Husky Stadium in 2012. The XFL&#x27;s Seattle Dragons began playing at Lumen Field in 2020 and returned in 2023 as the Sea Dragons.

Lumen Field is also designed for soccer. The first sporting event held included a United Soccer Leagues (USL) Seattle Sounders match. The USL team began using the stadium regularly for home games in 2003. The MLS expansion team, Seattle Sounders FC, began its inaugural season in 2009 at the stadium. Lumen Field was the site of the MLS Cup in 2009 and 2019; the latter set a new attendance record for the stadium with 69,274 spectators. The venue also hosted the 2010 and 2011 tournament finals for the U.S. Open Cup as well as the second leg of the 2022 tournament final for the CONCACAF Champions League; the Sounders won all three finals, with new tournament attendance records set for each final (or leg) hosted at Lumen Field. The stadium hosted several CONCACAF Gold Cup matches across multiple editions, and the Copa América Centenario in 2016. It will also host matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which was awarded to the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

== Funding ==
The Seahawks played their home games at the Kingdome from their 1976 inaugural season until 1999, sharing the stadium with Major League Baseball&#x27;s Seattle Mariners and the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Seattle SuperSonics. In 1995 a proposal was made to issue county bonds to fund a remodeling project of the facility. The proposal failed, and as a result, Seahawks&#x27; owner Ken Behring threatened to sell or move the team (likely to Los Angeles). In 1997 local billionaire Paul Allen pledged to acquire the team if a new stadium could be built and said that the team could not be profitable until they left the Kingdome. He asked the state legislature to hold a special statewide referendum on a proposal to finance a new stadium. Allen also agreed to cover any cost overruns. With Allen agreeing to pay the $4 million cost, the legislature agreed. The vote was scheduled to be held in June 1997 but in May a Seattle resident filed a lawsuit that claimed the legislature did not have authority to call for such a vote, since it would be paid for by a private party who could gain from the result. The case was delayed until after the vote. The proposal was pitched to voters as providing both a new home for the Seahawks and a venue for top-level soccer. It passed on June 17, 1997, with 820,364 (51.1%) in favor and 783,584 against. The vote was close in Seattle, but it received 60% approval in Seattle&#x27;s northern and eastern suburbs. The public funding was unpopular farther away in the eastern portion of the state. In October, a Thurston County Superior Court judge ruled that the legislature acted properly and in the public&#x27;s interest, and he dismissed the pending lawsuit. The Washington Supreme Court upheld the decision that December.

Voter approval of the referendum created a public–private partnership. The Washington State Public Stadium Authority was created to oversee public ownership of the stadium, exhibition center, and parking garage complex. Allen purchased the Seahawks and formed First &amp; Goal Inc. to build and operate the facility. The budget for the project was $430 million. Of this cost, $44 million was allotted to build the Event Center, $26 million for the parking garage, and $360 million for the stadium. First &amp; Goal was to cover cost overruns and pay up to $130 million of the project while the contribution from the public was capped at $300 million. The public funding package included new sports-related state lottery games, taxes on the facility&#x27;s admissions and parking, sales tax credits and deferrals, and an eight-year extension of the 2% tax on hotel rooms in King County. The taxes on admissions and parking were set below the authorized 10% to preserve the tax-exempt status of the project&#x27;s bonds, which were first issued on May 1, 1999; the percentage was increased to the full amount when the bonds were completely paid on January 1, 2021, with the taxes subsequently serving as dedicated funding sources for maintenance and modernization of the facilities. Furthermore, a clause in the referendum required Allen or his estate to give the Public Stadium Authority 10% of the proceeds from the sale of a majority or all of their interest in the Seahawks if they had done so before or on the 25th anniversary of the first bond sale. The proceeds would have been reserved for the state&#x27;s public schools had a sale of the team occurred before the bonds were fully paid off; any sale in between the bond retirement and the clause expiration would have seen the proceeds go towards improvements to the stadium instead.

In September 1998, First &amp; Goal signed a 30-year stadium lease that includes options to extend for another 20. Per the agreement, the Public Stadium Authority receives $850,000 a year from First and Goal (adjusted for inflation), and First &amp; Goal keeps all revenue from the stadium and parking garage. The company receives 80% of the revenue from the exhibition center while the other 20 percent is allotted to a state education fund. First &amp; Goal is responsible for all operating and maintenance costs, expected to be $6 million a year, and must keep the facility in &quot;first-class&quot; condition. Other details of the lease include the availability of affordable seats, a coordinated effort with neighboring T-Mobile Park (the Mariners&#x27; current ballpark) to prevent gridlock, a provision for naming rights, the investment in public art at the stadium, and the giveaway of a luxury suite to a fan each Seahawks&#x27; game.

== Construction and layout ==
The architectural firm Ellerbe Becket, in association with Loschky, Marquardt and Nesholm (LMN) Architects of Seattle, designed the project. Allen was closely involved during the design process. While growing up he attended games at the University of Washington&#x27;s (UW) outdoor Husky Stadium. His goal was to create a similar experience and atmosphere at the new venue. The exhibition center portion of the project was designed over a period of 14 months by LMN Architects while First &amp; Goal managed the construction. Town meetings were held to discuss the impact on the public, and the company created a $6 million mitigation fund for nearby neighborhoods. In accordance with a program established by the building team, contracts totaling $81 million were awarded to minority- and women-owned businesses. Union apprentices made up 19% of the workforce through another program with local trade unions.

Construction of the new exhibition center and parking garage was set to commence on September 19, 1998, but prolonged lease discussions between First &amp; Goal and the Public Stadium Authority delayed the official groundbreaking to September 28. The exhibition center opened on October 30, 1999, and subsequently hosted its first event on November 4. On March 26, 2000, to make way for the stadium, the Kingdome was demolished in the world&#x27;s largest implosion of a single concrete structure. Almost all of the Kingdome rubble was recycled with roughly half used for the new stadium. The designers were challenged by the soft soil at the site since it was a tidal marsh until public works projects in the early 20th century adjusted the waterline of nearby Elliott Bay. The top layer is a soft fill taken from the grading projects that had leveled portions of Seattle&#x27;s hills. To account for the soft soil, the complex sits on over 2,200 pilings driven below the ground to form what is essentially a pier for the foundation. Eight individually connected sections were built to account for the soil concerns, temperature effects, and the potential for earthquakes. The adjoining exhibition center and parking garage are separate structures and are not part of the eight-section stadium.

The site of Lumen Field is the smallest of those developed for new NFL stadiums, at . The upper levels were cantilevered over the lower sections to fit within the limited space. Along with the angle of seats and the placement of the lower sections closer to the field, this provided a better view of the field than typically seen throughout the country and allowed for a 67,000-seat capacity. Space is available to increase the total capacity to 72,000 for special events. Included in the capacity are 111 suites and over 7,000 club seats. The stadium has 1,400 seats for those with disabilities and their companions located in various sections. In 2009, Qwest Field ranked 21st out of the 31 stadiums in the NFL for total seating capacity.

The configuration of Lumen Field is a U-shape with an open north end to provide views of downtown Seattle and the large north plaza. The large retractable roof of T-Mobile Park along with Mount Rainier to the southeast can be seen from the partially open south end. The stadium&#x27;s concourses were built to be wide, and they provide additional views of the surrounding area. A 13-story tower was erected at the north end of the stadium that visually complements the Seattle skyline. The tower features a vertically oriented scoreboard which is the first of its kind in the NFL. At the base is bleacher seating for 3,000 called the &quot;Hawks&#x27; Nest&quot;. Another addition not previously seen in the NFL are field-level luxury suites located directly behind the north end zone.

Allen rejected plans for a retractable roof during the early stages of the stadium&#x27;s design. The lack of a retractable roof made it open to the elements, provided better views, and reduced the total cost of the project. The roof, at 200,000 sq ft (19,000 m2), covers 70% of the seats but leaves the field open. The roof spans between concrete pylon supports at the north and south ends of the stadium. Its two expansive sections are held from below by trusses. From above, two arches with additional supports rise over the field. Post-tensioned cables were used to achieve its final shape and positioning. To minimize damage in the event of an earthquake, the roof has a friction pendulum damper system. This disconnects the roof from the support pylons so that it can move independently of the structure. The technology had never been applied to a large-scale roof before Lumen Field. A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the Seattle area during construction. The structure responded as expected by the designers, and there was minimal damage. The project was completed on budget and a month ahead of schedule.

The roof was originally painted white to aesthetically distinguish it from both T-Mobile Park and the nearby industrial area; however, the paint gradually turned ash gray despite cleanings and repaintings, prompting a blue-colored repaint of the roof from May to July 2010. Light-emitting diodes following the outline of the stadium&#x27;s logo were subsequently installed on the roof in October 2019. The east side of the stadium has a large glass curtain wall that faces the nearby International District. The exterior of the stadium also consists of salmon-colored concrete, and the west side of the structure is partially clad with red brick. The coloring and facade were designed so the stadium would blend with the older buildings in neighboring Pioneer Square. To reduce costs, the exterior was not completed with brick or ornate steel work.

In 2015, the stadium was expanded with the addition of the Toyota Fan Deck on of space at its southern end; privately funded by the Seahawks, it consisted of a new 12 Flag raising platform flanked by two 500-seat sections, pushing the capacity of the stadium to 68,000. The 1,000 additional seats were made available to then-current season ticket holders, with remaining seats allocated to the Blue Pride waiting list for season tickets. The stadium also has additional seats that can be deployed for special events, bringing the maximum capacity to 72,000.

Lumen Field underwent minor renovations in 2022 as the stadium marked its twentieth anniversary. Improvements to the stadium made before the start of the 2022 Seahawks season include the conversion of an unused space below the Hawks&#x27; Nest into a food and beverage area, the addition of an open cashierless concession area on the concourse behind the Toyota Fan Deck, and the replacement of a pair of video display boards at the north end of the stadium with Diamond Vision boards from Mitsubishi Electric that were more than double the size of the pre-existing ones. A pregame hospitality area adjacent to the home team&#x27;s locker room was then opened for the 2023 Seahawks season; named the Tunnel Club, it allows spectators to view players walking between the locker room and the field. Additional planned renovations include the creation of two standing room open-air decks.

In October 2023, the stadium&#x27;s gates and concourses were renamed under a new &quot;neighborhoods&quot; program for destination signage; the four &quot;neighborhoods&quot; are Cityside (north), Cascade (east), Rainier (south), and Olympic (west). The concourses at Lumen Field are staggered: Olympic Hall on the west side is at field level, while Cascade Main on the east side and Rainier Main on the south side are elevated one level above. The club and suite levels sit above the Cascade and Olympic concourses, followed by the &quot;Summit&quot; levels for the Cascade, Rainier, and Olympic &quot;neighborhoods&quot;. Lumen Field has 45 concession stands, 63 restrooms with 799 toilets and 364 urinals, 12 elevators, and over 500 television screens. The stadium has a public art collection that includes &quot;Earth Dialogue&quot;, a series of four disks by Bob Haozous on the north side of the Hawks&#x27; Nest that faces Downtown Seattle.

== Surface ==
The 1997 state referendum stated that the stadium would feature a natural grass surface, but FieldTurf was not an option when the stadium was originally presented to voters according to the Public Stadium Authority. Seahawks management reconsidered the playing surface after the Seahawks played on FieldTurf at Husky Stadium during the 2000 and 2001 seasons. Artificial turf was installed because it was easier to maintain than natural grass. The potential damage to a natural grass field caused by Seattle&#x27;s frequent rain also made the surface an appealing option. In order to keep a grass surface robust under heavy football use during late fall and early winter rains, a $1.8 million irrigation and heating system would have been required. The coach of the Seahawks at the time, Mike Holmgren, said that FieldTurf installation was the right decision and stated that &quot;the players love it, and I think this surface will offer a better product on the field for the fans.&quot; Local soccer fans were concerned that the lack of a natural grass field would hinder Seattle&#x27;s chances of receiving an MLS expansion franchise. They asserted that voters had approved the facility with the understanding that the new stadium was intended for soccer as well as football. In a compromise, First &amp; Goal agreed to pay for grass to be installed for special events when needed.

In 2002, Seahawks Stadium became the first stadium in the NFL to install a FieldTurf artificial field. The surface is made of plastic fibers rooted in a mixture of ground rubber and sand. The field was replaced in early 2008 after tests showed that compression of sand and rubber increased the risk of player injuries. For the second installation, FieldTurf won the bid over Polytan. For the replacement surface, a one-inch (two and one-half centimeters) poured rubber foundation was added to prevent the compression from reoccurring. Under the naming rights agreement, Qwest paid $500,000 for the installation and First &amp; Goal paid the remaining amount, which was undisclosed. By 2010 the FieldTurf&#x27;s quality had decreased with the blades becoming matted down. It also failed FIFA&#x27;s quality testing to be ranked 2 Star. A new FieldTurf surface was laid down in 2012 and it met the requirements of a 2 Star field after testing. A new turf field, using the FieldTurf Revolution 360, was installed in February 2016 ahead of the 2016 Sounders season.

There have been various opinions regarding both the artificial surface and temporary grass surfaces used for soccer matches. After the Brazilian national team defeated Canada&#x27;s side 3–2 in 2008, Brazil&#x27;s coach commented that one reason for his team&#x27;s unexpectedly poor performance was the loosely installed grass field. The Grenada national team struggled to cope with the artificial surface during their loss at the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. In July 2009, the U.S. Soccer Federation chose D.C. United&#x27;s RFK Stadium over Qwest Field for the U.S. Open Cup. The general manager of D.C. United speculated that RFK&#x27;s grass field was one of the reasons his team had a stronger bid. The general manager of the Sounders, Adrian Hanauer, told &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; in 2010 that replacement of the surface was a continuing conversation between the Sounders and Allen&#x27;s Vulcan Inc. When the Los Angeles Galaxy traveled to Seattle in May 2012, the FieldTurf was noted as one of the reasons David Beckham and Robbie Keane were left out of the line-up. In 2014, the field was criticized during an ESPN broadcast after an Amazon corporate event involving a game of Quidditch damaged the pitch before a Sounders match. Zach Scott expressed concerns over the same installation of the field and its effects on his body. The 10-year lease extension between Sounders FC and First &amp; Goal announced in 2015 mandates new turf every four years or sooner; the first such new installation was in 2016.

Between August and November, both the Seahawks and Sounders FC host games at Lumen Field. Each team has emphasized the importance of playing their games without the other team&#x27;s painted lines on the field. Around 2003, at the Seahawks&#x27; request, local company EcoChemical developed for the field a new kind of paint that is &quot;designed to fail&quot;. The new paint is relatively easy to remove with a power washer and a special chemical solution, a process that the company describes as environmentally friendly. With the new paint, converting the field between American football and soccer takes 14 hours in dry weather, though painting logos and other colors takes additional time. Despite various preparations, some Sounders matches—particularly in the playoffs—have had Seahawks logos and American football lines painted on the turf.

=== Seahawks ===

Prior to the stadium opening in 2002, Allen and Bob Whitsitt said that they hoped the new stadium would help turn the Seahawks into a Super Bowl contender and that Seattle would be considered to host the championship game. The seating is expandable to 72,000 for the purpose of holding the game, but the NFL typically does not consider cities with outdoor stadiums where the average temperature in February is below . The number of season tickets available at Qwest was capped at 61,000 following the Super Bowl appearance. The ensuing waiting list was the first for the Seahawks since the early 1990s.

The team&#x27;s first season at their new home was in 2002. Their first game at the new facility was a 28–10 preseason loss to the Indianapolis Colts on August 11, 2002. They went on to end their first season at the new field with a 7–9 record. In the 2003 season, the team went undefeated at home and reached the playoffs. It was the first time the franchise had won 10 games in a single season in 17 years. The Seahawks again reached the postseason during the 2004 season and played their first playoff game at Qwest Field on January 8, 2005. In that game, they lost to the St. Louis Rams who had already defeated them twice that season. The following season, the Seahawks went undefeated at home for the second time in three years and won their first-ever NFC Championship, but lost in Super Bowl XL. Between 2002 and 2005, the Seahawks won 24 of their 32 regular season games at the stadium.

In 2006, the Seahawks had a 9–7 record and hosted the Dallas Cowboys in the wild card round of the playoffs. The Seahawks trailed 20–13 with less than 7 minutes remaining but came back to win 21–20. In 2007, the team won seven of their eight home games and clinched their fourth consecutive division title. Qwest Field was again the site for their wild card game, and they defeated the Washington Redskins 35–14. In 2008, the Seahawks went 4–12 and had only two home wins. Holmgren left the organization after the season. When he was interviewed about memorable moments and the fans, he said that Qwest Field was &quot;a remarkable place to compete in and to play professional football&quot;. He called a game at the stadium &quot;an experience&quot;.

In 2010, the Seahawks were the first NFL team with a losing record ever to win a division title in a season not shortened by a strike. Seattle earned its fifth consecutive home playoff victory with a 41–36 win over the New Orleans Saints. &quot;God bless the voters,&quot; defensive tackle Craig Terrill said after the game in reference to the stadium&#x27;s importance to the franchise.

Under Pete Carroll, the Seahawks were undefeated at home during the 2012 season. Season tickets for 2013 sold-out with a franchise-record 98% renewal rate. Through the 2018 season, the Seahawks compiled a regular season record of 95–41 at the stadium.

Lumen Field often sells out for Seahawks games; although the team struggled to sell out games (with two resulting blackouts) in its inaugural season at the stadium, it has sold out every game after the 2003 home opener, with 146 consecutive games sold out through the 2019 season. Despite dismal on-field performances in 2008 and 2009, the team maintained its base of season ticket holders; Before the 2008 season, the 14,000 single game tickets not already allotted sold out less than 15 minutes after they became available. After going 9–23 over two seasons in 2008 and 2009, the number of available season tickets was increased to 62,000. The largest crowd to attend a Seahawks game at Lumen Field was 69,190, against the Philadelphia Eagles on November 20, 2016.

==== Home field advantage ====
Lumen Field has earned a reputation as one of the loudest stadiums in the NFL. It was, at one point in time, in the Guinness World Record books for being the loudest stadium in the world. The seating decks and partial roof, both trap and amplify exceptional amounts of noise and reflect it back onto the field. This noise possibly contributes to increased false start penalties since opposing offenses can miss audibles and the snap count, as well as delay of game penalties due to the reduced efficiency of communicating plays to the offense. From 2002 through 2012, there have been 143 false-start penalties on visiting teams in Seattle, second only to the Minnesota Vikings. During that same time period, the Seahawks have accumulated a home win record of 59–29, with a simultaneous road record of 33–55.

When Tod Leiweke was hired as the Seahawks&#x27; new CEO in 2003, he had a large flagpole installed in the south end to fly the 12th Man Flag as a tribute to the team&#x27;s fans, collectively known as the 12th man. The team had retired the number 12 in 1984 to honor its fans, who had gained notoriety for intensifying the Kingdome&#x27;s noisy acoustics such that the NFL enacted a rule in 1989 penalizing home teams for disruptive crowd noise when visiting teams are on offense; the rule itself is rarely enforced due to the futility of controlling such noise leaguewide. A local celebrity, sometimes a former Seahawk, raises the flag during the network television pre-game events.

In 2005, the stadium gained national attention when the visiting New York Giants committed 11 false start penalties. Seahawks head coach Mike Holmgren attributed the penalties to the enthusiasm and noise from the crowd. He dedicated the ball used to make the game-winning field goal to the fans, and it is now displayed at the stadium. The Giants&#x27; general manager, Ernie Accorsi, asked an NFL senior vice president whether the Seahawks had broadcast artificial crowd noise over the public address system during this game. The NFL sent a memorandum early in the 2006 season about such complaints and sent officials to monitor two games. Holmgren denied the allegations, and the crowd responded by being even louder than usual when the Giants returned to Qwest Field. Since 2005 the Seahawks have tracked the number of false starts committed by visiting teams and display the statistic on a scoreboard to motivate the crowd. As of 2013, the stadium has had a league-high number of false starts since. In preparation for the 2005 NFC Championship Game at Qwest Field, the Carolina Panthers practiced with the recorded sounds of jet engines in the background to prepare for the volume of the crowd.

Kickers experience further disadvantages when attempting field goals at Lumen Field. Both the stadium&#x27;s proximity to Puget Sound and the open north end create winds that are challenging to gauge. Former Seahawks kicker Josh Brown adjusted to the winds, and he believed the moisture in the air caused trouble for others.

On September 15, 2013, Seattle Seahawks fans successfully broke the Guinness World Records for the loudest stadium in the world. The 131.9-decibel record occurred during the sack of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in the first quarter. Fans then broke their new record during the third quarter of the same game when a level of 136.6 decibels was achieved during a goal line stand by the Seahawks defense. The record was broken by the crowd at Arrowhead Stadium on October 13, 2013, with a sound pressure level of 137.57 decibels. The record was later regained by the Seahawks fans on December 2, 2013, with 137.6 decibels against the New Orleans Saints, but lost once again to Arrowhead Stadium in a Monday Night Football game between the Kansas City Chiefs and New England Patriots on September 29, 2014, setting the record that still stands at 142.2 decibels.

=== XFL ===
The Seattle Dragons of the XFL played their only two home games at CenturyLink Field during the short-lived league&#x27;s 2020 season. The team was among seven in the XFL to share its stadium with NFL teams and drew a league-record 29,172 fans at the home opener on February 15, 2020. The second game had 22,060 in attendance, with the team among the highest-drawing in the XFL before the league suspended operations in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The team resumed play in 2023 at Lumen Field as the Sea Dragons, holding their first home game on February 23. The Sea Dragons played their last game at the stadium on April 23, clinching a playoff berth with a 28–9 victory over the Vegas Vipers; the team did not survive the XFL&#x27;s merger with the United States Football League to form the United Football League the following year.

=== College ===
Lumen Field has hosted several college football games. The hometown Washington Huskies played their 2005 season opener against the Air Force Falcons at the stadium in Tyrone Willingham&#x27;s first game as head coach. The Huskies played their entire 2012 home schedule at the stadium while their home field, Husky Stadium, underwent a $250 million renovation; to expedite the start of the renovation by three weeks, the Huskies and the Washington State Cougars also played the Apple Cup in 2011 at then-CenturyLink Field. The stadium hosted its second Apple Cup in September 2024 after the Huskies moved to the Big Ten Conference and agreed to a five-year Apple Cup schedule with the Cougars.

From 2002 through 2014, the stadium hosted a Washington State Cougars&#x27; non-conference home game each season (except for 2010). This included the 86th &quot;Battle of the Palouse&quot; against the Idaho Vandals in 2003. The attendance for the dozen Cougar games ranged from 30,927 to 63,588. CenturyLink Field is approximately from WSU, but closer to many alumni in the Seattle metro area. The university&#x27;s athletic director said that an attendance of 50,000 was needed to make it worth moving the game from Martin Stadium in Pullman. The Cougars went 6–6 in their annual Seattle home game, which generated additional revenue that was invested in facilities for the football program while also increasing exposure to the western side of the state.

In April 2009, it was proposed that the annual Apple Cup between the Seattle-based Huskies and the Pullman-based Cougars be hosted at CenturyLink Field for six years beginning in 2010. The two programs could not reach an agreement on how to divide tickets. Pullman&#x27;s business community had expressed concerns that playing the game away from the Palouse would be detrimental to the local economy.

Qwest Field hosted the second and final Seattle Bowl in late 2002, in which Wake Forest beat Oregon 38–17. The inaugural Seattle Bowl was played a year earlier at Safeco Field, but the game was discontinued when organizers could not secure financing before 2003. Later attempts to revive the Seattle Bowl were unsuccessful. The Seattle Sports Commission led a push in 2008 for a new bowl game starting in 2010 that would have been a fundraiser for Seattle Children&#x27;s Hospital.

Lower division NCAA teams have played at the stadium throughout the years. From 2003 to 2008, the Division II football teams from Western Washington University and Central Washington University met each year in a rivalry game called &quot;The Battle in Seattle.&quot; Central won all but the 2004 game, and each meeting attracted more than 11,000. Western (of Bellingham) discontinued its football program after the 2008 season, but Central (of Ellensburg) agreed to continue the series with Western Oregon University (of Monmouth) for games in 2009 and 2010. &quot;Battle in Seattle VII&quot; saw Central make a comeback to win 23–21 in front of 5,374.

On October 31, 2009, the Division I FCS Eastern Washington University Eagles played a home game in Seattle for the first time. Along with the goal of drawing alumni from the metropolitan area, the athletic directors from both Eastern Washington (of Cheney) and Washington State had expressed the importance of connecting with alumni at receptions and other events on the western side of the state. Billed as the &quot;Showdown on the Sound&quot;, the game was a 47–10 victory over the Portland State Vikings. According to Eastern&#x27;s athletic director, Qwest Field&#x27;s rental was $50,000 for the day. The stadium subsequently hosted a game on September 11, 2010, between Eastern and Central; coined the &quot;Battle of the Sound&quot;, the game saw Eastern prevail over Central 35–32.

=== High school ===
Lumen Field has been used for high school football. The Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA) puts on the annual Emerald City Kickoff Classic at the stadium. The event is a season-opening series of games between some of the best teams in the state. The WIAA approached the Seahawks regarding use of the stadium for their high school football state championship games after moving them out of the Tacoma Dome in 2019, but the latter declined and recommended using Husky Stadium instead, noting that they were unable to match the offer terms from UW&#x27;s athletic department.

The stadium features a meeting between one of the best teams in Washington and one of the best from another state in the &quot;Best of the West&quot; game. On September 4, 2004, Washington&#x27;s Bellevue High School and California&#x27;s De La Salle High School played in front of over 25,000, a state high school event attendance record. Bellevue ended De La Salle&#x27;s national-record 151-game winning streak in a 39–20 win. On September 16, 2009, Bellevue defeated another highly regarded California school at Qwest Field in a 30–16 victory over Long Beach Polytechnic. &quot;USA Today&quot; had recently rated both teams highly with Long Beach third and Bellevue at 16th in the nation.

After the organizer of the event announced a match-up between Washington&#x27;s Skyline High School and Oregon&#x27;s Jesuit High School in 2009, he said that he proposed the possibility of televising games to Fox Sports, but Fox did not televise the game. Skyline went on to shut out Jesuit 17–0 during that year&#x27;s Emerald City Classic.

Within Lumen Field, a large art piece called &quot;The State of Football&quot; pays tribute to high school football in the state of Washington. The piece features a depiction of Washington and holds replica football helmets from every high school football team in the state. The installation is part of the Stadium Art Program commissioned through First &amp; Goal&#x27;s lease of the facility, costing nearly $1.75 million.

== Soccer ==
Lumen Field is also designed for soccer. The stadium meets FIFA sight line requirements and provides separate locker rooms for soccer teams. Camera locations were chosen for optimal television coverage of the sport. Numerous exhibition games have taken place at Lumen Field, including high-profile clubs such as Manchester United, Barcelona, Celtic, Real Madrid, Chelsea, Club América and Chivas de Guadalajara. These games have proved to be highly popular, and the first sell-out of 66,772 fans at the stadium was a soccer match between Manchester United and Celtic. National teams such as Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico, and China have played exhibition games at the stadium. The artificial turf has been temporarily overlaid with grass for international matches.

Seattle was the site of the 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup Group B opening round between the national teams of the United States, Costa Rica, Canada, and Cuba. Two matches of the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup opening round were also played at the stadium on July 4, 2009. In the second match, the United States comfortably defeated Grenada, who were playing in their first major international competition, 4–0. The Gold Cup returned in 2013 with Panama beating Martinique and Mexico defeating Canada in opening group play matches. CenturyLink Field also hosted three matches during the 2016 Copa América Centenario, a special inter-continental tournament, including two group stage fixtures and a quarterfinal match between the United States and Ecuador attended by 47,322 spectators.

On November 22, 2009, Seattle was the site of the 14th annual MLS Cup between Real Salt Lake and the Los Angeles Galaxy, where Salt Lake won the Cup on penalty kicks (5–4) in front of 46,011. The stadium was the eighth venue to host the event and had the fourth-largest attendance for an MLS Cup. The MLS Cup returned to Seattle in 2019, with the Sounders hosting Toronto FC as the team with the better regular season record. The Sounders won in front of 69,274 spectators, setting a new record for a sporting event at Lumen Field and recording the second-highest cup attendance in league history. Seattle will host the Sounders&#x27; three group stage matches during the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and three additional games after the installation of a temporary grass surface.

=== 2026 FIFA World Cup ===

Lumen Field is one of sixteen venues that will host the 2026 FIFA World Cup, to be played in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. The stadium is scheduled to host four matches during the group stage and two matches in the knockout stage. It is one of two Pacific Northwest venues hosting the event, together with BC Place in Vancouver.

Seattle had two venues—Lumen Field and Husky Stadium—among 58 facilities considered in the unsuccessful United States bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. When discussing Seattle as a candidate, Sunil Gulati of the U.S. Soccer Federation called Lumen Field (then Qwest Field) &quot;a world-class facility&quot;. Seattle finally hosted a World Cup qualifier on June 11, 2013; the qualifier, which was the city&#x27;s second overall and the first since 1976, saw the United States defeat Panama 2–0 in front of a raucous crowd of 40,847. The combined Canada–Mexico–United States won the right to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup following a 2018 vote by FIFA; Lumen Field was one of the 23 finalist venues named by the organizing committee.

Lumen Field was subsequently announced in June 2022 as one of the 11 American venues, as well as one of five current MLS venues selected to host matches. Under preliminary plans by the city government, it would cost up to $10.5 million to host the World Cup matches, including installation of a temporary grass surface, policing the venue and practice fields, and managing a fan festival at the Seattle Center or on the city&#x27;s waterfront. During the event, the stadium will be temporarily renamed to &quot;Seattle Stadium&quot; in accordance with FIFA&#x27;s policy on corporate sponsored names.

=== Sounders (USL) ===
The first sporting event at the stadium was a double-header on July 28, 2002, that included both the Sounders Select Women and the men&#x27;s Seattle Sounders of the USL team. The women defeated the Vancouver Breakers 4–3, while the men beat the Vancouver Whitecaps 4–1 in front of 25,515 people. The USL team began using the facility regularly as their home field in 2003. Although team management was concerned with the high rent and the underused seating capacity, they were drawn by the sponsorship opportunities and location. The Sounders increased their average attendance from 2,583 at Seattle&#x27;s Memorial Stadium in 2002 to 3,452 at the new stadium in 2003. In 2005, the Sounders beat the Richmond Kickers 2–1 in a penalty shootout for the USL championship in front of 8,011. Scott Jenkins scored the final goal and announced his retirement after the game.

In 2008, the MLS expansion franchise Sounders FC decided to develop the Starfire Sports Complex in nearby Tukwila, and the USL team played most of the season at that facility. At the time, team management thought that practicing and playing at Starfire could provide a better transition for those hoping to play for the new MLS team. The last match for the USL Sounders at Qwest Field was the 2008 season opener against the rival Portland Timbers. The game ended in a scoreless draw in front of 10,184.

=== Sounders FC ===

The potential to draw an MLS expansion team helped drive public support for building the stadium in 1997. In 1996, Seattle was considered for one of the 10 original MLS teams; however, the region lacked an adequate outdoor stadium. In 2007, it was announced that Seattle would be the home of an expansion team. The first Sounders FC regular season match was at the stadium on March 19, 2009. Fredy Montero scored the first goal in a 3–0 Seattle victory.

Before the opening of their first season, the Sounders already had the highest number of season ticket holders in the MLS after they sold all 22,000 of the offered season ticket packages. The team created a web site that was used to identify seating arrangements for season ticket holders based on personal interests including preferred method for watching a game and foreign team preference. For the first half of the inaugural season, the upper and lower sections were tarped off, limiting the seating capacity to 27,700. The club hoped to create an intimate environment as well as a supply-and-demand factor that would reward season ticket holders and encourage early purchase of seats. The stadium has continuously sold out league matches in the limited seating configuration. However, majority owner Joe Roth has said that he &quot;won&#x27;t be happy&quot; until the entire venue is open.

The stadium was designed to easily open seating sections in stages if needed. After repeated sellout crowds, additional sections were opened, increasing total capacity to 32,400. In the Sounders&#x27; first year they set an MLS record with an average home attendance of 30,943 people. Official capacity was increased to 35,700 after the 2009 season. In 2011, The Sounders continued to hold the highest average attendance in the league with 38,496. Official capacity was increased again to 38,500 with the opening of the Hawk&#x27;s Nest for the 2012 season. The team averaged 44,247 spectators in the 2015 MLS season, its all-time record. , the regular season MLS capacity at Lumen Field is listed as 37,722 seats, with four matches scheduled to use larger sections of the stadium.

The Sounders set the state&#x27;s single game soccer attendance record when they hosted Manchester United in front of 67,052 in July 2011. On October 15, 2011, additional seats were available for a record crowd of 64,140 during the final regular season home match, a Sounders 2–1 win followed by ceremonies honoring retiring goalkeeper Kasey Keller. And on October 7, 2012, another attendance record was broken when 66,452 fans were present for a 3–0 win over the Portland Timbers, following a ceremony awarding retired Forward Roger Levesque a Golden Scarf. The Sounders set an attendance record for sporting events at the stadium of 69,274 when Seattle hosted the 2019 MLS Cup Final against Toronto FC, winning 3-1 for their 2nd MLS Cup trophy.

CenturyLink Field has hosted two U.S. Open Cup tournament finals. On October 5, 2010, the tournament&#x27;s 81-year-old attendance record was broken when Sounders FC defeated the Columbus Crew 2–1 in front of 31,311. That record was broken one year later when CenturyLink Field again hosted the final on October 4, 2011, as 36,615 spectators watched Seattle defeat the Chicago Fire 2–0. The stadium has also hosted a CONCACAF Champions League tournament final; on May 4, 2022, the Sounders defeated Pumas UNAM 3–0 in the second leg of the final before a tournament-record crowd of 68,741 to win 5–2 on aggregate, becoming the first MLS team to win the tournament under its current format.

Like the Seahawks, the Sounders have received attention for sellout crowds and boisterous fans. &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; reported that a &quot;new standard for attendance and game-day atmosphere has been set&quot; due to the loud sellout crowds. The passionate Emerald City Supporters have dubbed the general admission sections behind the south goal the &quot;Brougham End&quot; for the street that runs along the south edge of the complex.

=== Seattle Reign FC ===
OL Reign played against Portland Thorns FC at the stadium on August 29, 2021, as part of a doubleheader with the Sounders and Timbers. The Reign defeated the Thorns 2–1 in front of 27,248, breaking the then NWSL&#x27;s attendance record. The Reign later announced on December 15 that they would move into the stadium for the 2022 season, leaving their previous home, Cheney Stadium in Tacoma, as plans to build a soccer-specific stadium in the city stalled amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The stadium&#x27;s capacity is reduced to 10,000 seats for most OL Reign home matches. A new NWSL attendance record of 34,130 was set on October 6, 2023, by the Reign for Megan Rapinoe&#x27;s final home match.

== Other events ==
The stadium became a yearly site for Supercross races in 2005. Seattle had been left out of the circuit since the Kingdome hosted the race in 1999. It takes more than 650 truckloads of dirt to build the course for the event that around 50,000 spectators attend. In May 2004, Qwest Field hosted the first Major League Lacrosse game played outside the East Coast; it hosted a second game the following year. The stadium has also been used for public speaking engagements. For example, the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, Tenzin Gyatso, delivered a 28-minute speech to 50,817 people on April 12, 2008.

The largest concert attendance in the stadium&#x27;s history was set on July 22, 2023, by Taylor Swift&#x27;s The Eras Tour; 72,171 spectators watched at Lumen Field on the first of two days. The record was surpassed a month later by Ed Sheeran&#x27;s The Mathematics Tour, which drew 77,286 to Lumen Field on August 26.

Lumen Field hosted several events related to the 2023 MLB All-Star Game, which was played at the adjacent T-Mobile Park. The first two rounds of the Major League Baseball draft took place at Lumen Field on July 9. The playing surface was divided into several pitching areas while the north lot and event center include performance stages, batting cages, and museum exhibits.

=== Event Center ===

The Lumen Field Event Center connects to the stadium&#x27;s west field plaza and consists of two exhibition halls, a conference room, and a concourse. The center hosts pre-game events for the Seahawks and Mariners. According to the Public Stadium Authority&#x27;s website, the event center contributes more than half a billion dollars to the region&#x27;s economy. Originally debuting as the Washington State Stadium Exhibition Center, the center became known as the Seahawks Exhibition Center upon the stadium&#x27;s opening in 2002. The center was renamed the Qwest Field Event Center in 2004 after Qwest acquired naming rights to the complex; it retained the &quot;Event Center&quot; name in subsequent renamings of the complex.

The Event Center had previously been called &quot;the worst venue in town&quot; for concerts, but in 2006, AEG Live and First &amp; Goal formed a partnership to create a new theater within the Event Center space. Washington Mutual (WaMu) obtained the naming rights to the new theater in a 10-year deal, calling it the WaMu Theater. The theater space can be assembled on an as-needed basis within the building and equipment, including the wide stage, can be dismantled and stored in the stadium. The theater&#x27;s acoustics were improved by installing panels on the ceiling and a large curtain. Depending on the seating configuration, the capacity can be 3,300, 4,000, or 7,000. Seal performed the inaugural concert on November 6, 2006. Though the naming rights deal was terminated following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual during the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the theater retained the WaMu name, with AEG intending to seek a new sponsor for it; the meaning of the WaMu abbreviation was subsequently altered to represent &quot;Washington Music&quot; instead.

During the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Event Center was contracted for use as a field hospital. The temporary hospital was erected in April 2020 with 250 beds under the management of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Army Corps of Engineers. On April 8, the state government announced that the field hospital would be dismantled and relocated to another state by the federal government, as the pandemic&#x27;s spread in Washington had slowed. In March 2021, the Event Center was converted into a mass vaccination center with capacity for 4,000 to 5,000 doses per week administered by the city government in partnership with First &amp; Goal and Swedish Health Services. The Event Center was also used as a vote center during the 2020 and 2022 elections by King County.

== Seismic experiments ==
During a Seahawks football game on January 8, 2011, the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN) recorded what was dubbed a &quot;Beast Quake&quot;, for Marshawn &quot;Beast Mode&quot; Lynch, a player whose performance on one running play excited the Qwest Field stadium crowd enough for the resultant shaking to be recorded on PNSN instruments. In 2014 and 2015 additional sensors were added in and around the stadium. Motivations for the experiment included conducting a quick-reaction exercise for the seismometer network team to install sensors and interpret results, and to test the ability to handle increased web traffic from interested visitors from the general public. Shaking was detected at the stadium after a 90-yard touchdown run during a January 10, 2015 playoff game, dubbed a &quot;Kam Quake&quot; for the player making the run, Kam Chancellor. The PNSN scientists stated that the biggest event of all was the &quot;Dance Quake&quot;, which was caused by all the jumping and dancing that followed Marshawn Lynch&#x27;s touchdown and 2-point conversion during 2014–15 NFC Championship Game on January 18, 2015.

PNSN has also recorded seismic activity from Sounders fans; multiple earthquakes were recorded on November 10, 2019, during the MLS Cup final between the Sounders and Toronto FC. Further &quot;RaveQuakes&quot; were recorded on May 4, 2022, during the second leg of the CONCACAF Champions League Final between the Sounders and Pumas UNAM. During two Taylor Swift concerts for The Eras Tour in July 2023, PSNS recorded a maximum ground acceleration of with peaks similar to a magnitude 2.3 earthquake. The readings were attributed to fan noise and dancing as well as the sound system used for the concerts.

== Facility contracts and naming rights ==
The stadium was originally named Seahawks Stadium. The name was changed to Qwest Field in June 2004 after telecommunications carrier Qwest bought the naming rights for $75 million for a period of 15 years. According to the agreement, the proceeds must be used for maintenance and upgrades. A portion of any profit then goes into a $10 million fund Allen guaranteed for youth playfields. As a result of CenturyLink&#x27;s acquisition of Qwest, the stadium was officially renamed CenturyLink Field on June 23, 2011. CenturyLink renewed its naming rights contract in 2017, paying $162.7 million for the stadium from 2019 to 2033. Although CenturyLink changed its corporate name to Lumen Technologies in September 2020, the stadium was to retain the CenturyLink Field name due to a clause in the contract that permits a one-time name change only if a corporate takeover occurs. Despite that clause, the name was changed to Lumen Field on November 19 following approval from the Washington State Public Stadium Authority.

After the stadium was renamed for CenturyLink in 2011, fans and media outlets speculated on potential nicknames for the venue. An informal reader poll conducted by &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; showed that &quot;The Clink&quot; was a popular suggestion; it was subsequently used among fans and locals. From 2009 to 2018, the field was entitled &quot;The Xbox Pitch at CenturyLink Field&quot; during Sounders FC matches as part of a sponsorship deal with Microsoft. However, when Zulily took over the Sounders FC sponsorship before the start of the 2019 season, the field was left unnamed; the deal did not include naming rights to the field. A new sponsorship with the Puyallup Tribe of Indians was announced in September 2022, renaming the field to &quot;Emerald Queen Casino Pitch at Lumen Field&quot;.

In addition to its 48 concession stands, restaurants and lounges are located throughout the stadium. Along with typical fare, local Pacific salmon sandwiches, Dungeness crab cakes, and microbrews are served, as well as food from Chinatown–International District restaurants. Aramark was the initial food and beverage service provider for the stadium and exhibition center, having signed a five-year contract in 2001. Levy Restaurants followed with a five-year deal to provide the service for the complex in 2006, while Delaware North Sportservice took over service operations in 2013; under both contracts, First &amp; Goal paid a management fee to the vendor while covering operational costs. The Seahawks subsequently created First &amp; Goal Hospitality to provide the food and beverage service in-house in 2017, doing so until Levy regained the rights via a partnership in 2020; the service continued to operate under the former brand as part of the agreement.

The pouring rights of non-alcoholic beverages at the stadium were initially held by The Coca-Cola Company, which had a longstanding partnership with the Seahawks prior to 1998, when the team partnered with PepsiCo. In May 2007, Seattle-based Jones Soda outbid Coca-Cola to sign a five-year contract for the rights, making it the only venue in the NFL that did not have a contract with either Coca-Cola or PepsiCo. Jones Soda, known for unusual and holiday-themed soda flavors such as Blue Bubblegum and Turkey &amp; Gravy, said it was working to develop football-related soda flavors, such as &quot;grass-stain&quot;. Amid increasing financial turmoil for Jones Soda, the company renegotiated its contract with the Seahawks in September 2009, relinquishing the rights to provide energy drinks and water along with a luxury suite. Both parties ultimately announced their mutual decision to end the Jones sponsorship in June 2010, following which Coca-Cola reclaimed the vending rights with a five-year agreement. The Seahawks and Coca-Cola announced a multi-year partnership extension in 2018.

== Transportation ==
Lumen Field is bordered by the Pioneer Square, International District, and Industrial District neighborhoods of Seattle. The stadium&#x27;s referendum approval required a transportation management program to coordinate transportation options. First &amp; Goal&#x27;s facility lease agreement also included a provision to ease gridlock. A &quot;dual event agreement&quot; with T-Mobile Park was established so that two events with a combined attendance of over 58,000 would not occur within four hours of each other. The agreement was also implemented to coordinate mass transit to the stadiums on game days.

The Link light rail system has two stations on the 1 Line that serve Lumen Field: Stadium station near the south entrances and International District/Chinatown station near the north entrances. Light rail trains run every 15 minutes on weekends and serve Seattle, Tukwila, and SeaTac. It began service on July 18, 2009, the same day as an exhibition match between the Sounders and Chelsea. Local and regional buses service the area with stops within three blocks of the stadium, and the county&#x27;s King County Metro bus service formerly offered express routes from several area park and ride lots for games.

Intercity trains serve the stadium through Seattle&#x27;s King Street Station and overflow tracks accommodate extra trains during events. Sounder commuter trains operate regional service on Sundays if the Seahawks have a home game or for mid-day Sounders FC games on Saturdays. In 2008, the commuter trains carried 64,000 event goers to the two nearby stadiums. Amtrak, primarily through the Pacific Northwest corridor&#x27;s Cascades route, also serves the station.

Lumen Field is located near the junction of Interstate 5 and Interstate 90 to the east. It is bordered by State Route 99 and the south portal of the State Route 99 tunnel to its west, while the State Route 519 corridor connects I-90 to the neighborhood. Local governments compromised with both the Seahawks and Mariners on the location of new ramps over the train tracks that run along the east sides of Lumen Field and T-Mobile Park. An overpass for South Royal Brougham Way, the road that borders the south edge of the Lumen Field complex, to improve access and safety was completed in May 2010. The stadium has 2,000 parking spaces in its parking garage and 8,400 in the surrounding lots to accommodate automobile traffic. Beginning in December 2011, construction of the Stadium Place mixed-use development project replaced much of the north lot. The developer must replace the 500 lost parking spots and turn over parking revenue to the Public Stadium Authority per an agreement with King County.

<text>Airlines Aero was a regional airline based in Tallinn, Estonia. It operated services between three Finnish destinations, as well as international flights to Tallinn. All of their flights were operated under Finnair&#x27;s designation &quot;AY&quot;. Its main bases were Helsinki-Vantaa and Tallinn-Lennart Meri. Aero ceased its operations in January 2008.

== History ==
The name harkens back to Aero Airlines&#x27;s and Finnair&#x27;s first incarnation, &quot;Aero AS&quot;, founded in 1923, and its first Junkers F 13 seaplane took off from Helsinki harbor in Katajanokka to a lake near to the present Ülemiste Airport in Tallinn for its first flight, March 20, 1924, carrying 162 kg (357 lbs) of mail. Other destinations were quickly added: Stockholm and Königsberg, from where passengers took trains respectively to Göteborg (sometimes boarding other planes to Copenhagen, Oslo and London) and to Berlin, and passengers began to queue up at some periods — up to 48 per day in 1926, waiting for the four-seaters to fly them.

After initial reluctance from the Finnish authorities to build airports, Aero&#x27;s fleet could eventually dispose of its seaplanes and get on wheel-landing aircraft in 1938. But the airlines disappeared as a consequence of the annexion of Estonia by the Soviet Union in June 1940.

Finnair retained Aero AS&#x27;s IATA designator AY, while the modern-day Aero Airlines flew as EE. The airline was re-established in 2000, and started operations in March 2002, within the Baltic region. It was owned by Aero Holding (51%) and Finnair (49%), was the ownership was later transferred wholly to Finnair. Aero had 128 employees (at March 2007).

Aero scaled down its operations during 2007, and finally flew its last flight on 6 January 2008. All its former routes are now operated by Flybe and Finnair.

The IATA code (EE) and call-sign (REVAL) have been re-used by Nordica, which began operations at the end of 2015.

== Destinations ==
Aero Airlines operated services to the following scheduled destinations (at December 2007): Helsinki, Tallinn, Turku and Vaasa.

== Fleet ==

The Aero Airlines fleet consisted of ATR-72-201 airplanes, which were formerly operated by its parent company Finnair. The last two were sold to UTair when Aero ceased its operations.

<doc id="206818" wikidata="Q190908" url="?curid=206818" title="Seven (1995 film)">
<text>Seven (often stylized as Se7en) is a 1995 American crime thriller film directed by David Fincher and written by Andrew Kevin Walker. It stars Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, with Gwyneth Paltrow and John C. McGinley in supporting roles. Set in an unnamed, crime-ridden city, &quot;Seven&quot;″s narrative follows disenchanted, nearly retired Detective Lieutenant William Somerset (Freeman) and his newly transferred partner David Mills (Pitt) as they try to stop a serial killer from committing a series of murders based on the seven deadly sins.

Walker, an aspiring writer, based &quot;Seven&quot; on his experiences of moving from a suburban setting to New York City during a period of rising crime and drug addiction in the late 1980s. An Italian film company optioned his script, but following financial difficulties, the rights were sold to New Line Cinema. Studio executives were opposed to the script&#x27;s bleak conclusion, insisting on a more mainstream and optimistic outcome. Fincher, determined to re-establish himself after a career setback with his directorial debut &quot;Alien 3&quot; (1992), was mistakenly sent Walker&#x27;s original script and, convinced of its merit, committed to directing the project if the original ending remained intact. Principal photography took place in Los Angeles between December 1994 and March 1995, on a $33–$34million budget.

&quot;Seven&quot; garnered middling test audience results and was not predicted to perform well due to its violent and mature content. However, it grossed $327.3million worldwide, becoming a sleeper hit and the seventh highest-grossing film of the year. Contemporaneous reviews were generally positive, praising the performances of the central cast and the ending. &quot;Seven&quot; revitalized Fincher&#x27;s career and helped Pitt move from roles based on his appearance to more serious, dramatic roles.

In the years since its release, the critical reception has been more positive. The film has inspired a number of TV series and films with its aesthetic, music, and premise. Its title sequence, which depicts the killer preparing for his actions in the film, is considered an important design innovation that sparked a renewed interest in title design, while the film&#x27;s twist ending has been named as one of the most shocking and unforgettable in cinematic history.

== Plot ==
In an unnamed city overcome with violent crime and corruption, disillusioned police Detective Lieutenant William Somerset is one week from retirement. He is partnered with David Mills, a young, short-tempered, idealistic detective who recently relocated to the city with his wife, Tracy. 

On Monday, Somerset and Mills investigate an obese man who was forced to eat until his stomach burst, killing him. The detectives find the word &quot;gluttony&quot; written on a wall. Somerset, considering the case too extreme for his last investigation, asks to be reassigned, but his request is denied. 

The following day, another victim, who had been forced to cut of flesh from his body, is found; the crime scene is marked &quot;greed.&quot; Clues at the scene lead Somerset and Mills to the sloth victim, a drug-dealing pederast whom they find emaciated and restrained to a bed. Photographs reveal the victim was restrained for precisely one year. Somerset surmises the murders are based on the Christian concept of the seven deadly sins.

Tracy invites Somerset to share supper with her and Mills, helping the detectives overcome their mutual hostility. On Friday, Tracy meets privately with Somerset because she has no other acquaintances in the city. She reveals her unhappiness at moving there, especially after learning she is pregnant, and believes the city is an unfit place to raise a child. 

Somerset sympathizes with Tracy, having persuaded his former girlfriend to abort their child for similar reasons and regretting it ever since. He advises Tracy to inform Mills only if she intends to keep the child.

A remark by Mills inspires Somerset to research libraries for anyone checking out books based on the seven deadly sins, leading the pair to John Doe&#x27;s apartment. Unexpectedly, Doe returns home and is pursued by Mills. Doe incapacitates him by striking him with a tire iron and holds him at gunpoint, but chooses to leave him alive and flees. 

The police investigate Doe&#x27;s apartment, finding a large amount of cash, hundreds of Doe&#x27;s notebooks, and photographs of some of his victims; the cache includes images of Somerset and Mills by a person they believed was an intrusive journalist at the sloth crime scene. Doe calls the apartment and speaks of his admiration for Mills.

On Saturday, Somerset and Mills investigate the fourth victim, lust, a prostitute who has been raped with a custom-made, bladed strap-on by a man held at gunpoint. The following day, the pride victim is found: a model whom Doe facially disfigured. Unable to live without her beauty, she committed suicide. 

As Somerset and Mills return to the police station, Doe arrives covered in blood and surrenders himself. He threatens to plead insanity at his trial, potentially escaping punishment, unless Mills and Somerset escort him to an undisclosed location where they will find the envy and wrath victims. During the drive, Doe says he believes God has chosen him to send a message about the ubiquity of, and apathy toward, sin. Doe has no remorse for his victims, believing the shocking murders will force society to pay attention to him.

Doe leads the detectives to a remote location far outside city limits, where a delivery van approaches. Somerset intercepts the vehicle, whose driver was instructed to deliver a package to Mills at this specific time and location. He is horrified at the package&#x27;s contents and tells Mills to put down his gun. 

Doe reveals he himself represents envy because he envied Mills&#x27;s life with Tracy and implies the package contains her severed head. He urges Mills to become wrath, telling him Tracy begged for her life and that of her unborn child, and takes pleasure in realizing Mills was unaware of the pregnancy. 

Despite Somerset&#x27;s pleas, Mills, distraught and enraged, shoots Doe dead, completing Doe&#x27;s plan. Police remove the catatonic Mills, and Somerset tells his captain he will &quot;be around.&quot; Somerset says in voiceover: &quot;Ernest Hemingway once wrote: &#x27;The world is a fine place, and worth fighting for.&#x27; I agree with the second part.&quot;

== Production ==
=== Writing ===
In 1986, aspiring screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker moved from the suburbs of Pennsylvania to New York City, and described the culture shock of living in a city undergoing significant rises in crime and drug abuse. While working as a sales assistant for Tower Records in 1991, Walker began writing a spec script called &quot;Seven&quot;, which is set in an unnamed, bleak and gloomy city that was inspired by his &quot;depressing&quot; time in New York. Walker said: &quot;it&#x27;s true that if I hadn&#x27;t lived there I probably wouldn&#x27;t have written &quot;Seven&quot;... &quot; Film studios were eager for high concept spec scripts—simple and succinct ideas that could be easily sold to audiences. Walker believed his thriller about police officers pursuing a serial killer driven by the seven deadly sins would attract attention and help begin a professional writing career.

Walker intended to leave the script&#x27;s narrative open to interpretation to avoid invalidating the opinions of the prospective audience. He wanted to defy audience expectations, and leave them feeling &quot;violated and exhausted&quot; by the conclusion. According to Walker, &quot;there&#x27;s lots of evil out there, and you&#x27;re not always going to get the satisfaction of having any sort of understanding of why that is. That&#x27;s one of the things that scares people the most about serial killers&quot;. To shape the character of the killer, Walker drew inspiration from his own experiences navigating city streets, where he witnessed crimes and sins unfolding openly on every corner. This exploration led him to contemplate the idea of an individual who deliberately fixated on these sins. He had Doe surrender himself to the police because it would rob the audience and characters of the anticipated satisfaction, opting instead to leave them in discomfort leading up to the finale.

In the early 1990s, Italian company , under manager Phyllis Carlyle, optioned the script. Walker received the minimum fee permitted by the Writers Guild of America (WGA), which proved sufficient to quit his job, relocate to Los Angeles, and dedicate himself to working on &quot;Seven&quot;.

===Development===
To lead the project, Penta Film hired director Jeremiah S. Chechik, known for his recent success directing the comedy film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot; (1989) and seeking a more serious project. Chechik and Penta Film insisted on several script changes, including the removal of the bleak conclusion, in which Tracy&#x27;s severed head is delivered in a box. Facing the ultimatum of complying with these requests or risking replacement or project cancellation, Walker acquiesced and wrote a more-mainstream ending in which the detectives confront Doe in a church described as either on fire or burned out. In this revised script, Doe embodies the sin of envy and kills Mills before being shot dead by Somerset, while a pregnant Tracy leaves the city. In a 2017 interview, Walker said he felt he was ruining his script and should have left the project. To meet the studio&#x27;s demands, Walker wrote a total of thirteen drafts.

As the script option was due to expire and Penta Film was experiencing financial difficulties—leading to its dissolution in 1994—the studio sold the rights to producer Arnold Kopelson, who subsequently took it to New Line Cinema. Chechik left the project, and Guillermo del Toro and Phil Joanou were approached to replace him; Joanou rejected the offer because he found the story too bleak.

David Fincher was known mainly for directing popular music videos, such as &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Who Is It&quot;. His only feature film, &quot;Alien 3&quot; (1992), had been a negative experience as the studio edited it against Fincher&#x27;s intent, leading to him disowning the project, stating &quot;I&#x27;d rather die of colon cancer than make another movie&quot;. Despite this, Fincher&#x27;s agent presented him with the &quot;Seven&quot; script. Initially uninterested in the police procedural elements, Fincher found himself captivated by the gradual revelation of Doe&#x27;s plans, admitting, &#x27;I found myself getting more and more trapped in this kind of evil... and even though I felt uncomfortable about being there, I had to keep going.&#x27; Fincher recognized the script aligned with his own creative sensibilities, especially its exploration of evil, and uncompromising ending in which the protagonists do not engage in a last-minute action sequence to save Tracy because she is already dead. Fincher expressed his interest to the studio, which realized he had been sent Walker&#x27;s original script. New Line Cinema sent Fincher an up-to-date draft in which Tracy survives but Fincher insisted on directing the original script. In discussions with Michael De Luca, New Line Cinema&#x27;s president of production, both shared a preference for the original script. They mutually decided to begin filming that version within six weeks, wary that any further delay might attract unwanted executive attention and potential interference with their plan.

Kopelson and studio executives continued efforts to lighten &quot;Seven&quot;″s tone and change the ending. Fincher was resistant to any changes, and was unwilling to compromise his creative control and vision. De Luca remained supportive of Fincher, and the original ending gained further backing as the project secured prominent actors, including Freeman, Pitt, and Spacey. Pitt joined &quot;Seven&quot; on condition the head-in-the-box ending be retained, as he was upset that the original ending of his previous film &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; (1994) had been cut in response to negative test-audience responses. He also insisted that Mills kill Doe, believing it was important that Mills act out of passion instead of morality. Kopelson supported Fincher after being reassured the severed head would not be shown. Walker said changing the dark tone of the ending would remove the core of the story.

Walker further refined the script. His changes included extending a chase sequence depicting Mills cautiously pursuing Doe, aiming to avoid typical cinematic chases in which characters frantically pursue their target, saying that were he in that situation he would be wary to turn any corner. A shooting script was completed by August 1994.

===Casting===
Pitt had established himself as an in-demand and highly-paid film star following successes with &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; (1994) and &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot;, but Fincher had not considered him to portray Mills because he felt Pitt did not fit the image he had for the character. However, after meeting Pitt, Fincher believed he was charismatic and likeable enough that he could keep the audience on Mills&#x27;s side regardless of the character&#x27;s actions. To help secure Pitt&#x27;s involvement, Kopelson shortened the pre-production schedule from twelve weeks to five to accommodate Pitt&#x27;s schedule. Pitt rejected several offers from other films because he wanted to escape his typecasting as a romantic lead character in favor of something with a more &quot;documentary feel&quot; with urban settings and a focus on dialogue, akin to thriller films such as &quot;The Conversation&quot; (1974). Pitt described Mills as a well-intentioned &quot;idiot&quot; who &quot;speaks before he really knows what he&#x27;s talking about&quot;. He cut his hair for the role and lost weight to reduce the muscle he developed for &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot;. Sylvester Stallone and Denzel Washington rejected the role.

Walker named the character Somerset after writer W. Somerset Maugham. He envisioned William Hurt playing the character but Fincher cast Freeman; the studio was concerned pairing a black detective with a white one would make &quot;Seven&quot; seem derivative of the action film &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; (1987). Robert Duvall and Al Pacino rejected the role. The script was further modified after Pitt&#x27;s and Freeman&#x27;s castings to better match their acting styles; Mills was made more verbose and Somerset&#x27;s dialogue was reduced, and made more precise and direct. Robin Wright auditioned for the role of Tracy and Christina Applegate rejected it before Paltrow was cast. Pitt had recommended Paltrow after being impressed by her audition for &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot;. Fincher preferred Paltrow but initial discussions suggested that if approached she would not be interested in a film with a dark tone like &quot;Seven&quot;. Fincher auditioned about 100 people before Pitt contacted Paltrow to meet with them. Fincher said that Tracy was important because she provides the film&#x27;s only tonally positive elements and he thought Paltrow&#x27;s previous performances demonstrated she could effectively convey this in Tracy&#x27;s limited screentime.

Fincher and Walker wanted Ned Beatty to play John Doe because of his resemblance to the 1969 composite sketch of the Zodiac Killer; Beatty declined, describing the script as the &quot;most evil thing I&#x27;ve ever read&quot;. Michael Stipe, lead vocalist of rock band R.E.M., was considered but filming dates conflicted with the band&#x27;s tour. Christopher Guest was also considered. Val Kilmer and Gene Hackman declined the role; R. Lee Ermey auditioned but Fincher found his portrayal unsympathetic and lacking depth. Kevin Spacey was preferred by Pitt but executives refused to pay his asking price. Doe&#x27;s scenes were initially filmed with an unknown actor portraying Doe; the filmmakers quickly decided to replace them and Pitt helped negotiate Spacey&#x27;s involvement. Spacey, who filmed his scenes in twelve days, received a Friday night call asking him to join and was filming by the following Tuesday. Spacey wanted his name omitted from the film&#x27;s marketing and opening credits to ensure the killer&#x27;s identity remained secret. He said:
&quot;I&#x27;d just done &quot;Swimming with Sharks&quot; (1994), &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, and &quot;Outbreak&quot; (both 1995)... I knew that if any of those movies did well, my profile would be... different... If I&#x27;m the third-billed actor in a movie where the top two billings are trying to find somebody and they don&#x27;t find that somebody until the last reel, then it&#x27;s obvious who that somebody is... I felt very strongly that it was the right thing to do for the movie. We finally won because it was a deal-breaker; I was either going to be on a plane to shoot the movie or I wasn&#x27;t&quot;.

The actor Bob Mack made his film debut as gluttony, who was described as a &quot;very heavy guy face down in spaghetti&quot;. Gene Borkan was cast to play the greed victim because the filmmakers wanted someone who resembled lawyer Robert Shapiro. He did not realize his character would already be dead and refused a request to perform nude. On the set, when he realized what his scene entailed, Borkan renegotiated his salary, receiving &quot;five times [the $522 Screen Actors Guild (SAG) day-scale fee]&quot;. Michael Reid MacKay&#x27;s audition for the sloth victim involved him portraying a corpse that slowly turned his head towards the camera; his performance was deemed &quot;creepy&quot; enough. Set decorator Cat Mueller portrayed the lust victim after Fincher&#x27;s assistant said she had the personality and body to portray a dead prostitute. She received $500 for six hours of filming over two days but described being nude in front of Pitt as a perk. Model Heidi Schanz was cast as the pride victim after the previous actor dropped out. Fincher, who was running low on time, wanted a model with existing headshots and pictures that could be displayed in the character&#x27;s apartment. The film&#x27;s content made casting and crewing &quot;Seven&quot; difficult; Gary Oldman turned down an unspecified role, Fincher&#x27;s former costume designer declined to work on the film, and talent agents refused to pass offers on to their clients, describing &quot;Seven&quot; as &quot;evil and misogynistic&quot;.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography began on December 12, 1994, and concluded on March 10, 1995. Walker was on set throughout filming to provide suggestions or on-spec rewrites but did not give Fincher much input, believing he should adapt the script as he wanted. Michael Alan Kahn served as assistant director.

Location filming took place entirely in downtown Los Angeles. Fincher wanted to film in Oakland, California, because of its aesthetically pleasing clapboard houses but the schedule would not allow for this. Rain often fell during filming; Fincher decided to film in rain to avoid continuity errors and because Pitt was only available for fifty-five days before he began filming &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; (1995). Fincher also said the rain introduced an inescapable element for the characters because conditions were bad inside and outside, and that the rain made the film&#x27;s city appear less like Los Angeles, which is associated with sunny weather.

&quot;Seven&quot;″s aesthetic was influenced by films such as &quot;All That Jazz&quot; (1979), &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991), and &quot;The French Connection&quot; (1971), as well as the over-the-shoulder viewpoint used in documentary television show &quot;Cops&quot; because of its implicit vulnerability. Cinematographer Darius Khondji named the crime thriller &quot;Klute&quot; (1971) as a significant influence because of its &quot;use of toplight... widescreen compositions for intimacy rather than big vistas, the way that vertical strips of the city are shown in horizontal mode, the fragments of faces and bodies... the look of &quot;Se7en&quot; has this heightened sense of realism—a realism that&#x27;s been kicked up several notches and becomes its own style&quot;. Fincher chose one scene in &quot;Klute&quot; in which the only illumination is the character&#x27;s flashlight, saying he disliked other films in which characters state visibility is low but the audience can clearly see the scene. Khondji used a mixture of lighting, using the warm light of Chinese lanterns to represent the past and present, and the cold light of Kino Flos to represent the future.

The studio was unhappy with the darkness of the dailies; Khondji suggested printing the footage brighter but Fincher refused to compromise. Available footage was made into a well-received promotional showreel for the theater-owner convention ShoWest, after which complaints about the darkness ceased. Khondji used Panavision Primo lenses, which offered a sharp image with good contrast, and Kodak film stocks that could capture the &quot;gritty&quot; interiors and deep blacks for night-time exteriors.

Khondji described the scene in which Mills pursues Doe as one of the most-difficult scenes to film due to its length, fast camera movements in rain, and tight, barely lit interior spaces. One segment had to be re-filmed because the location was too dark for the camera to capture Freeman&#x27;s face. Pitt insisted on performing his own stunts for the scene; he slipped on a rain-slicked hood, crashing through the windshield and sustaining injuries including cut tendons and nerves in his left hand; Fincher said he saw exposed bone. Pitt returned to the set a few days later, having received stitches and a forearm cast, which had to be written into later scenes. For scenes set prior to the chase, Pitt would keep his hand in his pocket or otherwise obscured to hide the injury.

The crew had to clear used condoms and crack pipes from the location of the sloth victim sequence, replacing them with prop crack pipes and air fresheners. Though the reveal that the victim is still alive was written into the script and known to the stars, sloth actor Michael Reid MacKay relates that Fincher had only told the SWAT actors that there would be &quot;a corpse&quot; in the scene, leading them to expect a prop, and that McGinley&#x27;s shock at his movement was genuine on the first take. Lights with green color gels were shone through the window from the adjacent building to impart the scene with a green tint. The ending was scripted to take place directly beneath transmission towers, a location Doe selects to interfere with the police communications; the towers, however, interfered with the film crew&#x27;s radios and the actors had to use cell phones to communicate with the crew from afar.

=== Ending and post-production ===

The film&#x27;s ending remained a point of contention between New Line Cinema and the filmmakers; Fincher, intending to stun the audience, wanted to follow Mills&#x27;s shooting of Doe with a sudden cut to black but executives believed this would alienate audiences. Fincher instructed staff at a test screening to keep off the lights following the cut to black so the audience could take it in but his instructions were not followed. After the screening, one female audience member walking by Fincher said: &quot;the people who made that movie should be killed&quot;. According to Fincher, the screening invitation only told audiences that the film would feature Pitt and Freeman, both of whom were known for films very different in tone to &quot;Seven&quot;. Executives wanted a mainstream conclusion in which Mills and Somerset pursue Doe and a kidnapped Tracy, who would survive. According to Pitt, the studio wanted a more heroic ending for Mills in which he did not kill Doe, and instead of Tracy&#x27;s head being in the box, for it to be the head of one of Mills&#x27;s dogs. Freeman preferred a storyboarded sequence of Somerset killing Doe, sparing Mills from losing his career as well, but Pitt believed Mills had to kill Doe and test audiences preferred that version. Another alternative ending depicted Mills shooting Somerset to stop him killing Doe first. Fincher and Pitt both refused to compromise with the studio&#x27;s request to replace the head-in-the-box ending but settled for a longer epilogue showing Mills being arrested and Somerset delivering a concluding narration, offering some humanity. According to Fincher, the box contained a taped shot bag with a wig.

Pitt and Fincher were unhappy with the car-ride scene leading into the ending because the dialogue had to be overdubbed after too much ambient sound had been picked up during filming. Pitt believed this caused the scene to lose its momentum, affecting the pacing and emotion. The helicopter scenes were also filmed in post-production because there was no time during principal photography; the studio agreed the provision of extra time and funding for additional scenes if they were deemed necessary. Because these scenes were filmed several months later than the rest of the film, the green ground had turned brown and the ground-based scenes had to be color-corrected to match the new footage. The opening credits were scripted to be set over footage of Somerset visiting a countryside home he intended to purchase for his retirement, taking a piece of the wallpaper which he would carry through the film, before returning to the city by train. This was intended to create a stark contrast between the countryside and the darkness of the city but there was insufficient budget to film it. As a result, scenes of Somerset looking at the wallpaper piece had to be cut.

Richard Francis-Bruce edited the 127-minute theatrical cut. His style focused on &quot;having a motivated cut&quot; in which every cut had a specific purpose. For the finale, he introduced more rapid cuts to emphasize the tension as Doe&#x27;s plan is revealed, and a brief, four-frame insert of Tracy as Mills pulls the trigger to compensate for not showing the contents of the box. To emphasize the darkness, Fincher and Khondji used an expensive, lengthy bleach bypass chemical process that retained some of the silver that would normally be removed from the film stock. The silver created a luminous effect in light tones and deeper, darker colors. Of the 2,500 prints sent to theaters, only a few hundred used the process.

&quot;Seven&quot; was budgeted at $30–$31million but Fincher persuaded studio executives to provide further funding to achieve his vision for the film, eventually pushing it $3million over budget, to $33–$34million, making it New Line Cinema&#x27;s most expensive film at that point. A studio employee said executives would meet with Fincher, adamant he would receive no further funding, but his relentless and persuasive attitude would change their mind.

=== Music and sound===

Fincher hired Howard Shore to score &quot;Seven&quot; based on his score for &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991). Shore said Fincher would attend recording sessions but rarely interfered with Shore&#x27;s process. The score, which was performed by an orchestra of up to 100 musicians, combines elements of brass (including trumpets), percussion, piano. &quot;Portrait of John Doe&quot; serves as the central theme with two cue notes; a rising version is used for Tracy&#x27;s appearances. Shore described the film&#x27;s ending as having a visceral effect on him; he incorporated his reaction into the sequence&#x27;s score, providing little accompaniment during the dialogue between Mills, Somerset, and Doe, but using it to punctuate significant moments such as Somerset opening the box.

Shore&#x27;s opening theme &quot;The Last Seven Days&quot;, a more upbeat piece, was replaced with Nine Inch Nails&#x27;s song &quot;Closer&quot;, which was remixed by Coil and Danny Hyde. David Bowie&#x27;s song &quot;The Hearts Filthy Lesson&quot; is used for the end credits. &quot;Seven&quot; features songs including &quot;In the Beginning&quot; by the Statler Brothers, &quot;Guilty&quot; by Gravity Kills, &quot;Trouble Man&quot; by Marvin Gaye, &quot;Speaking of Happiness&quot; by Gloria Lynne, Bach&#x27;s Air from his Suite No. 3 in D Major, BWV 1068, performed by the Stuttgarter Kammerorchester conducted by Karl Münchinger, &quot;Love Plus One&quot; by Haircut One Hundred, &quot;I Cover the Waterfront&quot; by Billie Holiday, &quot;Now&#x27;s the Time&quot; by Charlie Parker, and &quot;Straight, No Chaser&quot; by Thelonious Monk.

Sound engineer Ren Klyce and Fincher inserted frequent diegetic background sounds, such as rain or screaming, to create a psychological impression that terrifying things are occurring off-screen even when the audience cannot see or escape it. Klyce and sound designer Steve Boedekker also produced the music that is heard at the entrance to the sex club where the lust victim is murdered.

== Design ==
===Style and set design===
Production designer Arthur Max, costume designer Michael Kaplan, Fincher, and Khondji collaborated on establishing a unified vision for the art direction. These guidelines established that the designs should represent a world where everything is corrupted, dysfunctional and in a state of decay. Fincher was influenced by the photography of William Eggleston and Robert Frank, who focused on &quot;coolness&quot;, making the visuals simultaneously gritty, stylized, classic, and contemporary. Khondji said Frank&#x27;s style could be seen in &quot;Seven&quot;″s very bright exteriors and dark interiors, a visual contrast achieved by underexposing the film negative. The final scene with Mills, Somerset, and Doe, had inconsistent lighting because the actors were always lit from behind by the sun regardless of their placement in the scene.

Fincher wanted precise staging for every scene to make the audience feel as if they were in the location. Believing it was important to create limitations to challenge himself, Fincher had sets built without removable walls, and the crew had to film within their confines. Doe&#x27;s murder scenes were influenced by photography, such as the work of Joel-Peter Witkin. The sloth scene in particular was influenced by the work of painter Edvard Munch, drawing on the green and &quot;claustrophobic&quot; imagery.

===Victims===
Rob Bottin led development of practical effects. He researched crime-scene photographs and police evidence files, observed an autopsy, and studied the effects of obesity to realize his designs. For the gluttony victim, Mack spent up to 10 hours a day having makeup and prosthetics applied. Mack said he was unaware he would be surrounded by live insects until reading the daily call sheet and noticing a &quot;cockroach wrangler&quot;. A fiberglass replica of Mack was used for the character&#x27;s autopsy.

Bottin&#x27;s team spent 11 days experimenting on the aesthetic and prosthetics for the sloth victim. MacKay was tall and weighed 96 to 98 lb (about 44 kg) during filming, offering a slight frame for the emaciated character. The filmmakers asked him to lose more weight but he refused. The effects team made a body cast of MacKay to develop rubber prosthetics that could be applied all over his body. These prosthetics were painted to appear bruised and scarred, MacKay&#x27;s skin painted a pale white with highlighted veins, and he was fitted with gelatin sores, overgrown fingernails, skeletal teeth, and matted hair. The process took up to 14 hours, requiring MacKay to begin at 5am to be ready for filming by 8pm. He had to remain fairly still during four hours of filming, having to limit his breathing to prevent his stomach rising and falling, and the cold on set was worsened by makeup artists repeatedly spraying his body with water. Unable to move, he tensed his muscles to warm himself. He described the relief that came when he was permitted to cough in McGinley&#x27;s inspecting face, because he could move and breathe again.

For Schanz&#x27;s pride victim, Fincher added blood to her while her nose was taped to the side and her face was covered in gauze. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) mandated cuts to some scenes of Bottin&#x27;s effects work to secure a film rating. Fincher described &quot;Seven&quot; as psychologically violent, implying violence without overtly showing it. In the opening scene, Walker portrays a corpse lying in a pool of blood; he said the blood was very cold and he had a minor panic attack once in place because he was worried about moving and ruining the shot.

===Title credits===
Following the removal of the planned opening train-ride scene with Somerset, Fincher needed a temporary title sequence to screen &quot;Seven&quot; for studio executives. He recruited R/GA designer Kyle Cooper and his team to assemble a montage reflecting Doe&#x27;s perspective. This helped to establish the character and the threat he poses prior to his appearance in the film&#x27;s final act. The sequence was set to the &quot;Closer&quot; remix at Fincher&#x27;s request.

The sequence was well-received by executives, who suggested retaining it for the theatrical release. Fincher did not want to appear to be accepting their suggestion and instructed Cooper to develop a new concept; Cooper persuaded Fincher to use a more-elaborate and detailed version of the montage. Cooper focused on Doe&#x27;s elaborate journals, briefly glimpsed in the film, while Fincher suggested the sequence should depict Doe. Fincher wanted Mark Romanek to direct the sequence, being a fan of his music video for &quot;Closer&quot; and sharing similar design sensibilities, but Cooper secured the role because of his previous experience on similar title sequences. Fincher told Cooper: &quot;all I want is for the audience to want to run screaming from the theater during the title section&quot;.

The title sequence depicts Doe&#x27;s preparations and routines for his murderous plans, such as cutting off his fingertips, processing photographs in his bathtub, and making tea. This was inspired by Cooper&#x27;s appreciation for the &quot;elegant&quot; way Doe stirs his tea following his surrender. The sequence focuses on Doe writing his journal and crossing out words such as &quot;pregnancy&quot;, &quot;marriage&quot;, and other elements representing a &quot;perfect life&quot;, which he does not believe people deserve. Fincher said: &quot;it was a way of introducing the evil. The idea was that you&#x27;re watching title sequences from the mind of somebody who&#x27;s lost it... [the audience] won&#x27;t understand while they&#x27;re watching it, but they&#x27;ll get it later&quot;. Clive Piercy and John Sabel made Doe&#x27;s journals, which cost tens of thousands of dollars each to fill with text and images; about six complete journals were made, supplemented by blank ones on shelves. Artist Wayne Coe storyboarded the sequence, which Harris Savides filmed and Angus Wall edited. Cooper regularly conferred with Wall on ideas, and spent the night before filming locating items such as fish hooks and loose hairs from his drain, which he believed would make interesting inclusions.

Filming took place over eight days, including two days filming a hand-model stand-in for Doe. Fincher was upset at the casting because the model&#x27;s hands were shorter and chunkier than Spacey&#x27;s. A further five weeks were spent assembling the sequence. Although digital options were available, Cooper&#x27;s team chose to assemble the sequence by hand, believing any irregularities and accidents in the images would enhance the overall aesthetic, and manually added scratches, tears, and pen marks directly to the film negative. Fincher and Cooper devised a rough-looking text for the credits to appear as if written by a &quot;disturbed hand&quot;. The text was etched onto a black-surfaced scratchboard and visually manipulated while being transferred to film to add a smear effect combined with variants of the same text achieved by placing the text over a light box and filming them over-exposed, creating an animation-style effect. &quot;Disquieting&quot; sounds were added throughout the sequence at a low frequency, such as barking dogs and screams. The title sequence cost $50,000.

== Release ==
===Marketing===
New Line Cinema had low expectations for &quot;Seven&quot; based on middling scores from test audiences. The studio&#x27;s marketing president Chris Pula called the advertising campaign for &quot;Seven&quot; risky because it had to prepare people for the film&#x27;s dark, violent content while making it a topic of discussion among potential audiences. Early trailers and newspaper, television, and radio advertisements focused on the seven sins, presenting &quot;Seven&quot; as an &quot;edgy&quot; prestige film rather than a jumpscare-style horror. Entertainment professionals believed violent or horrific films had a limited appeal and rarely received positive reviews. Fincher&#x27;s public image had also been tarnished by the failure of &quot;Alien 3&quot;, and although Freeman and Pitt were proven stars who were capable of attracting audiences, New Line Cinema struggled to capitalize on Pitt&#x27;s popularity. Pitt&#x27;s core audience, teenage girls, were not the film&#x27;s target audience and research showed young men would avoid taking a romantic partner to films featuring Pitt because they felt &quot;threatened&quot; by his appeal. The positive word-of-mouth following &quot;Seven&quot;″s release resulted in the marketing campaign shifting focus toward targeting Pitt&#x27;s female fans.

The premiere of &quot;Seven&quot; took place on September 19, 1995, at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills, California. The event was attended by over 800 guests, including Fincher, Freeman, McGinley, Spacey, Tia Carrere, Elliott Gould, Matthew Modine, Lori Petty, Lou Diamond Phillips, Michael Rapaport, Eric Roberts, Robert Rodriguez, Steven Seagal, John Singleton, Christian Slater, Quentin Tarantino, and Jennifer Tilly.

=== Box office ===

&quot;Seven&quot; received a wide-release in the United States and Canada on September 22, 1995. During its opening weekend, &quot;Seven&quot; grossed $14million across 2,441 theaters—an average of $5,714 per theater—making it the number-one film of the weekend, ahead of the debut of &quot;Showgirls&quot; ($8.1million), and &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar&quot; ($4.5million), in its third week of release. &quot;Seven&quot; had the highest-grossing September opening weekend of its time, replacing 1991&#x27;s &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Dead: The Final Nightmare&quot; ($12.6million). The successful opening was credited to Pitt&#x27;s broad popularity, a lack of competing action films, and the marketing campaign overcoming audience skepticism around the premise. Audiences polled by market research firm CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on a scale of A+ to F. New Line Cinema distribution executive, Mitch Goldman had moved forward the release date of &quot;Seven&quot; to avoid competition and strategically opened the film in more theaters than usual to target suburban and small-town locations where Pitt&#x27;s recent films had fared well.

&quot;Seven&quot; remained numberone in its second weekend, ahead of the debuts of &quot;&quot; ($7.3million) and &quot;Devil in a Blue Dress&quot; ($5.4million), and in its third weekend ahead of the debuting &quot;Assassins&quot; ($9.4million) and &quot;Dead Presidents&quot; ($8million). &quot;Seven&quot; remained the most-popular film until its fifth weekend, falling to number3 behind the debuts of &quot;Get Shorty&quot; ($12.7million) and &quot;Now and Then&quot; ($7.4million), and was among the ten-highest-grossing films for nine weeks. &quot;Seven&quot; had grossed about $87million by the end of December, when it received a wide re-release in select locations to raise its profile during the nomination period for the 1996 Academy Awards. The re-release helped raise &quot;Seven&quot;″s box-office revenue to about $100.1million, making it the ninth-highest-grossing film of 1995, ahead of &quot;Die Hard: With a Vengeance&quot; ($100million) and behind &quot;Casper&quot; ($100.3million). According to estimates by industry experts, as of 1997, the box office returns to the studio minus the theaters&#x27; share was $43.1million.

&quot;Seven&quot; also performed well in areas outside the U.S. and Canada, receiving positive audience reactions and successful debuts in Australia ($1.8million), South Korea ($808,009), Seoul ($961,538), New Zealand, and the Netherlands. The film grossed a further $227.2million from these markets.

In total, &quot;Seven&quot; grossed an estimated worldwide total of $327.3million, This made it the seventh-highest-grossing film of the year. &quot;Seven&quot; was an unexpected hit, becoming one of the most successful and profitable films of 1995. Literary critic John Kenneth Muir said that many horror films released in 1995 had failed at the box office despite their association with prominent genre directors like Wes Craven and John Carpenter. Muir credited &quot;Seven&quot;″s breakout success to its hybridization of horror, police procedural, and urban noir aesthetic, as well as describing instead of showing much of the violent imagery, leaving it to the audience&#x27;s imaginations.

==Reception==
=== Critical response ===

&quot;Seven&quot; received generally positive reviews. Critics such as Roger Ebert and Desson Howe described &quot;Seven&quot; as an intelligent, well-made film that could comfortably stand alongside other thrillers. Others compared &quot;Seven&quot; unfavorably with &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, saying &quot;Seven&quot; lacks the other films&#x27; intelligent narrative, and takes itself too seriously as an examination of evil instead of a &quot;silly piece of pulp&quot;. The &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; said, however, &quot;Seven&quot; offers a &quot;terrific film-noir atmosphere&quot; and excellent performances, with &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; saying the film would be &quot;unendurable&quot; without Freeman and Spacey.

James Berardinelli and Janet Maslin, among others, praised Freeman&#x27;s performance. Terrence Rafferty and Kenneth Turan wrote Freeman&#x27;s &quot;exceptional&quot; performance is mainly responsible for making &quot;Seven&quot; watchable in spite of itself. Howe and Berardinelli said the performance elevated Pitt&#x27;s own to appear &quot;actorly&quot;, although Freeman often steals every scene in which he appears, providing a fresh take on an otherwise-cliché role. Reviews of Pitt&#x27;s performance were polarized between those who found it &quot;energetic&quot; and impressive and those who believed the role was beyond his acting abilities. Some reviewers said Pitt&#x27;s performance continued his successful transition to more-serious roles from those based mainly on his appearance, although Howe said Pitt&#x27;s presence does more for &quot;Seven&quot; than his acting. The &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; said what could have been a cliché role was saved by Mills not being inept or inexperienced, just out of his depth in this case. Jami Bernard and Turan described the character as underdeveloped, pointless, stupid, and not particularly likeable, remarking that Pitt&#x27;s performance lacks the subtlety or effectiveness to compensate. Several critics positively received Paltrow&#x27;s performance, saying she made the most of her limited screentime and was generally underused while considering the character a &quot;flimsy contrivance&quot;. Spacey&#x27;s performance was also praised for its creepy, understated portrayal of an intelligent character who does not undermine himself with &quot;a moment of sheer stupidity&quot;.

Fincher&#x27;s directorial style was commended for its &quot;striking craftmanship&quot; and &quot;stunning&quot; visuals that often simultaneously thrill and exasperate the viewer. In contrast, Rafferty said his style is less effective when stretched over the film&#x27;s runtime, and that Fincher mistook darkness for profundity and chose style over coherence. Although Gene Siskel considered Walker&#x27;s script to be smartly written, several critics were less enthusiastic, finding the dialogue trite, many scenes implausible, and character motivations weak. Bernard and Richard Schickel wrote &quot;Seven&quot; lacks many of the essentials prevalent in its genre such as suspense, witty dialogue and cathartic humor, and the psychological depth to match the intellectual thrills of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;.

The violent content of &quot;Seven&quot; was generally negatively received. Critics such as Berardinelli and Siskel found the gore excessive and &quot;gratuitous&quot;. While some found the violent visuals to be tiresome and detracting, others said Fincher skilfully avoided showing the violence that led to the deaths, preventing them from distracting from &quot;Seven&quot;″s more enjoyable aspects. According to Ebert and Turan, however, &quot;Seven&quot; would be too disturbing for many viewers. Fincher responded: &quot;I didn&#x27;t set out to piss off the people who are upset. I was told that Michael Medved [film critic at &quot;New York Post&quot;] wrote that the movie was evil, but I&#x27;m sure he slows down when he passes an accident just like everyone else. Death fascinates people, but they don&#x27;t deal with it&quot;. Howe and Owen Gleiberman said the ending is &quot;like an act of treachery against the viewer&quot;, undermining any hope for a positive outcome; and Barry Norman said it denies the audience &quot;even of the final comfort they fully deserve&quot;. Ebert, however, found the ending &quot;satisfying&quot; but underwhelming compared to the film&#x27;s earlier events.

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Seven&quot; received one nomination at the 68th Academy Awards for Best Film Editing (Richard Francis-Bruce), and Walker was nominated for Best Original Screenplay at the 49th British Academy Film Awards. At the MTV Movie Awards, &quot;Seven&quot; received three awards; Best Movie, Most Desirable Male (Pitt), and Best Villain (Spacey). New Line Cinema re-released &quot;Seven&quot; in Westwood, Los Angeles, California, on December 26 and in New York City on December 29, 1995, in an unsuccessful attempt to generate Academy Award nominations for Freeman, Pitt, and Fincher.

==Post-release==
=== Home media ===
The soundtrack of &quot;Seven&quot; was released in November 1995; the 11-track compact disc (CD) and cassette-tape release contains several of the songs used in the film such as &quot;Guilty&quot; and &quot;In the Beginning&quot;, and two pieces of the score (&quot;Portrait of John Doe&quot; and &quot;Suite from Seven&quot;) but omits &quot;Closer&quot; and &quot;The Hearts Filthy Lesson&quot;. A bootleg recording of the score, featuring additional tracks, was released in 1998.

&quot;Seven&quot; was released on VHS (Video Home System), DVD, and Laserdisc in 1996. A two-disc special edition DVD that was released in 2000 offered a remastered picture scanned from the original film negative and introduced features including extended and deleted scenes, the original opening with Somerset and cut-to-black ending, production photographs and designs, and storyboards for an alternative ending. The release also includes four commentary tracks: Pitt, Fincher, and Freeman discussing &quot;Seven&quot;; a discussion between Fincher, De Luca, Francis-Bruce, Walker, and film studies professor Richard Dyer; Khondji, Max, Dyer, Francis-Bruce, and Fincher; and an isolated music and effects score with commentary by Shore, Klyce, Dyer, and Fincher. The film was released on Blu-ray Disc in 2010; the release features remastered visuals and contains all of the additional content in the special edition, with an additional collectible DigiBook version containing production notes and photographs. The complete 16-piece score was officially released in 2016 on compact disc.

In 2023, Fincher announced he was developing a 4K resolution remaster of &quot;Seven&quot; from the original film negative. Fincher said he would not alter the film&#x27;s content, but intended to enhance some visual elements to take advantage of modern technology and conceal any flaws made obvious by the higher resolution. A theatrical re-release took place exclusively in IMAX theaters for one week only beginning January 3, 2025, followed by a 4K Ultra HD Blu-Ray release on January 7, 2025 for the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

===Other media===
A novelization of &quot;Seven&quot; that was written by Anthony Bruno was released alongside the film in November 1995. A seven-issue comic-book series was released between September 2006 and October 2007 by Zenescope Entertainment; serving as a prequel to the film&#x27;s events of the film, the comic book focuses on Doe and the planning of his crimes.

==Thematic analysis==
===Apathy and hope===
The apathy of the film&#x27;s unnamed city&#x27;s inhabitants is a central theme in &quot;Seven&quot;. Somerset does not believe the city can be saved, intending to retire beyond its confines, and tells Mills that women are taught to yell &quot;fire&quot; rather than &quot;help&quot; because people are more likely to pay attention if they selfishly think themselves in danger. Film scholar Amy Taubin described the city as an infection point for corruption, in which signs of violence and decay are omnipresent in its dark corners, rain, television reports, fights, screams, and children in impoverished apartments. Richard Dyer draws parallels between the perpetual rain in &quot;Seven&quot; and films like &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), emphasizing its relentless and pervasive nature. In &quot;Seven&quot;, the incessant rain symbolizes sin permeating every conceivable crevice. The city&#x27;s bleak aesthetic implies a moral decay and indifference by its inhabitants that enables Doe&#x27;s plan, which can be considered akin to the sloth sin.

The city reflects a common trend in Hollywood cinema during the 1980s and 1990s, portraying iconic American urban settings like New York City as nightmarish realms of criminality and moral chaos, as seen in films such as &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981), &quot;Batman&quot; (1989), &quot;Darkman&quot; (1990), and &quot;The Crow&quot; (1994). Macek said such films articulate a pronounced anti-urbanism, surpassing the mere recycling of cultural imagery. Despite their lack of realism, these movies tap into the fantastical realm of horror and entertainment, allowing them to express repressed fears and anxieties within viewers&#x27; everyday lives. &quot;Seven&quot;″s city is presented as a blighted, decaying zone of unfettered criminality and vice, echoing a reactionary view of urban problems concerning segments of the contemporary American middle class. According to Macek, &quot;Seven&quot; validates suburban fears of inner city communities and the urban poor as unruly and beyond redemption. Professor Kirsten Thompson characterizes the city as devoid of temporal or spatial markers, with an absence of recognizable elements like street signs, costumes, or specific vehicles that could provide clues to its identity. This intentional lack of distinct features creates an unsettling impression that the city exists in a perpetual state of ambiguity, simultaneously everywhere and nowhere. The narrative thus reinforces the notion that the city is trapped in a temporal loop, condemned to endlessly repeat cycles of sin and corruption without the prospect of liberation or escape.

Somerset has not stopped caring but has become resigned to the apathy of those around him and the futility of his efforts. &quot;Seven&quot; underscores this in several scenes, such as the dismissal of his concerns regarding a child witnessing a murder, the police captain&#x27;s indifference to a mugger stabbing his victim&#x27;s eyes, and the sex club manager who dislikes his role but sees no alternative. Critic Matt Goldberg describes Mills and Tracy as naïve to the city&#x27;s corruption; for example, they are tricked into renting an apartment that experiences constant shaking from nearby trains. Thompson observes that Tracy, unlike Mills, possesses a more discerning perspective, having already concluded that the city holds no promising future for her family and expresses her desire to return to their home outside its borders. Somerset supports her, hoping to spare Tracy and her unborn child from the influences of the city.

Both Somerset and Doe perceive the ubiquity of sin and indifference toward it. There are parallels between the characters, both of whom live alone, are devoted to their work, and have no meaningful relationships. Although there is mention of some acquaintances, Somerset tells Tracy that those who spend time with him find him disagreeable. Somerset and Doe differ in their response to sin; Somerset has surrendered to apathy and despair, whereas Doe feels contempt for society and has assumed the role of its punisher. It is implied Somerset was passionate about his work until he realized the futility of effecting change, while Doe remains dedicated and fervent, believing in the transformative impact of his actions. Somerset, who has never taken a life, retains a glimmer of hope for humanity&#x27;s redemption, while Doe, in contrast, freely commits murder, convinced of humanity&#x27;s irredeemable nature. When confronted by Mills about the innocence of his victims, Doe retorts that sin pervades the city to such an extent that innocence becomes trivial and tolerated.

Walker described Mills as the optimist and Somerset as the pessimist. The ending proves Mills optimism was misplaced, but given the option to walk away from the problem as intended or stay, Somerset remains. Doe&#x27;s plan works, shocking Somerset out of his apathy, and inspiring him to defer his retirement and fight for a better future. Rosenbaum described it as an enduring belief in the ability of goodness to prevail once again, tempered by the fact the hope is inspired by a self-martyred serial killer. He said &quot;Seven&quot; chose style over substance, giving the overall message that nothing will really change.

Writers Deborah Wills and Andrew Wilson concluded that despite the seemingly hopeless worlds depicted, &quot;Seven&quot; challenges viewers to confront their complicity in everyday events and act differently, and reconsider their outlook and approach to a world they deem worthy of redemption. Released during a period of heightened anxiety leading up to the Millennium, &quot;Seven&quot; tapped into prevalent fears and marked the two-thousandth anniversary of Jesus Christ&#x27;s birth, intensifying apocalyptic speculations. In the decade surrounding this transition, many films addressed concerns about time running out, reflecting a broader sense of societal decay. &quot;Seven&quot; embodies this millennial sensibility, portraying a world devoid of hope for a better future, where individual detachment appears as the only distant prospect amid the prevailing chaos.

===Religion and order===
Somerset characterizes Doe&#x27;s murders as his sermons to the masses. According to Dyer and author Matthew Saunders, Doe conducts a violent crusade, illustrating the consequences of moral decay and sin, based on his interpretation of Christian ideology, in a city similar to the biblical Sodom and Gomorrah. Writer Patricia Moir suggests that theorists in the late 1990s believed societal norms in North America were diminishing due to the decay of social meta-narratives of order created by religion, science, and art, and that in absence of these paradigms, all that remains is the chaos of existence. Somerset tries to create order using the ticking of a metronome to disguise the disordered noise of sirens and screams outside his apartment. Dyer wrote that Somerset&#x27;s smashing of the metronome signifies his acknowledgment of the city&#x27;s darkness. Doe creates order by filtering literature about the seven deadly sins and works by authors such as John Milton through a lens of religious fanaticism. He believes his purpose is God-given, which is reflected in the opening credits depicting Doe cutting the word &quot;God&quot; from a dollar bill.

Doe rationalizes that everyone is guilty of sin or wishing ill on other sinners, including himself, hence his plan involves his own death. Goldberg suggests that Doe is the true sin of wrath, evidenced by his violent acts. His resigned acceptance of the envy sin after assigning wrath to Mills is, according to Goldberg, because there is no other sin for him to take and he is conscious sin will not end with his death. Doe&#x27;s transfer of wrath to Mills demonstrates the infectiousness and pervasiveness of sin. Mills&#x27;s killing of Doe can be considered an act of justice, eliminating a remorseless force of evil, although his motivation is purely for revenge.

Professor Philippa Gates suggests that the greatest fear Doe represents is the possibility he is right, as his challenging of sinners is informed by Roman Catholic doctrine. Mills is ostensibly the hero and Doe the villain, but from Doe&#x27;s perspective his victims were not innocent, drawing justification from biblical precedent. The idea that Doe&#x27;s crimes could be defended as a means of redeeming the city creates a paradox where Mills, responsible for two deaths, is portrayed as a hero, while Doe, a murderer, is considered evil.

===Art and literature===
According to Professor Thomas Fahy, art, literature, music, and high culture play pivotal roles in both Doe&#x27;s mission and Somerset&#x27;s investigation in &quot;Seven&quot;. Doe strategically conceals a crucial clue to his plot at the greed murder scene by turning a piece of art upside down, a detail discernible only by someone versed in art, and reflecting the city&#x27;s own upturned status. Somerset engages in scholarly work at the library, accompanied by Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;Air&quot; as a thematic backdrop to the intellectual atmosphere of the setting. &quot;Seven&quot; underscores the significance of knowledge and culture in comprehending Doe, as Somerset delves into works such as &quot;The Parson&#x27;s Tale&quot; by Geoffrey Chaucer and Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. Despite its importance, Somerset&#x27;s intellectual and philosophical inclinations isolates him, with fellow officers resenting his propensity for posing what they deem unnecessary questions. In contrast, Doe employs art for brutal purposes, crafting murder set pieces that undermine Somerset&#x27;s sense of security. Mills, however, differs from both men, demonstrating a less comprehensive education and rudimentary understanding of these more cultured themes, which proves a disadvantage against the intellectual and well-read Doe. Writer Paul Gormley posited that &quot;Seven&quot; challenges racial stereotypes by affording Somerset a leading role with privileged knowledge, juxtaposing him with the naive white protagonist, Mills.

Journalist Kim Newman describes Doe&#x27;s murders as art installations intended for observation, reminiscent of philosopher Michel Foucault&#x27;s concept of spectacular punishment. The victims are staged like models, challenging the audience to perceive the murders as repulsive and compelling, using art to express violence and highlighting the cultural divide between the educated and uneducated. Doe&#x27;s portrayal as an aesthete-killer draws comparisons with characters like fictional killers such as Hannibal Lecter, yet Doe does not define himself by high culture, surrounding himself with his own art. Some, like Professor Jeremy Tambling, find allegorical links between sins and murders to be forced, questioning Doe&#x27;s embodiment of envy and representing lust through the victimized prostitute.

&quot;Seven&quot; also uses color to symbolize sins. Writer Shaina Weatherhead said &quot;Seven&quot; foreshadows the importance of wrath (represented by the color red) and envy (the color green) throughout, such as Somerset&#x27;s red lamp and Mills&#x27;s green mug. &quot;Seven&quot; makes other references to art such as a stack of spaghetti cans resembling &quot;Campbell&#x27;s Soup Cans&quot; by Andy Warhol.

&quot;Seven&quot; includes subtle references to the number seven, reinforcing the religious subtext; Doe&#x27;s plan culminates on a Sunday, the seventh day of the week and the biblical day of rest, on which Doe&#x27;s package for Mills is delivered at 7:01pm. Somerset&#x27;s research references texts such as &quot;The Parson&#x27;s Tale&quot;—which discusses penance—and a reference to seven children being slain. Of particular focus is the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; which depicts seven terraces of purgatory, each relating to an individual sin, and the nine circles of hell. Professor Steve Macek interprets the unnamed city as an allegory for the hell in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. Author Valerie Allen further explores the Dantean parallels, comparing Mills to the passionate and emotional Dante who is guided through hell by the wise and rational Somerset/Virgil. While Somerset, like Virgil, is somewhat saved by &quot;Seven&quot;″s denouement, Mills is denied the redemptive themes of Dante, ending the film in despair. Allen describes the moral landscape of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; as holding human actions accountable to reason, emphasizing justice and mercy as a cosmic principle and distinguishing between the punishment of hell and penitence in Purgatorio. While these humans can potentially purge themselves through virtuous acts, Doe&#x27;s punitive approach exacerbates the city&#x27;s problems rather than bringing balance.

===Culture of celebrity===
Moir and Professor James Oleson comment on the excesses of performance art and the culture of celebrity, with Mills disdainfully labeling Doe as a &quot;movie of the week&quot; and a &quot;fucking T-Shirt&quot;, implying that Doe&#x27;s legacy will be short-lived, eventually fading into obscurity. While Moir proposes that the film leaves Doe&#x27;s legacy open-ended, hinting at the potential for further deterioration, Oleson argues that Doe&#x27;s impact in the real world cannot be ignored, asserting that discussing and studying Doe inadvertently validates his vision. Oleson explores the societal phenomenon of glorifying serial killers, citing notorious figures like Jack the Ripper, Ted Bundy, and Jeffrey Dahmer, who attained widespread recognition, as well as individuals who are sexually attracted to perpetrators of heinous crimes. The cultural fascination extends to fictional serial killers like Doe, Hannibal Lecter, Dexter Morgan, and John Kramer who are depicted as intelligent, resourceful, and endowed with unique motivations and methods.

Dyer draws a parallel between Doe and Lecter, highlighting their ability to outsmart and manipulate authorities while employing artistic methods in their murders. However, Dyer distinguishes their disparate social statuses: Lecter, an educated professional with refined tastes, contrasts with Doe, who appears self-taught, unemployed, and fixated on his mission. In contrast, Rosenbaum contends that &quot;Seven&quot; avoids glorifying Doe through comedic moments or heroic portrayals. Author Adam Nayman presents a critical view of &quot;Seven&quot;, suggesting that the film elevates Doe as a figure with valid societal critiques.

===Characters===
Writers Terri Murray and Lewis Rose highlight a thematic parallel between Somerset and Doe, emphasizing their meticulous, fastidious, and patient natures, contrasting with the brash and impulsive Mills, who portrays himself as a crime-fighting hero. Critic Jonathan Rosenbaum observes that Mills and Somerset stand in stark contrast in terms of temperament, morality, intelligence, and personal connections. Somerset is analytical, wise, and experienced while Mills is young, messy, and inexperienced but full of potential. Mills, characterized by his optimism and relatively light-hearted nature, moves to the city with the belief that he can have a positive influence. Tracy, according to Dyer, symbolizes potential virtue, but her impact is reduced because her appearances are infrequent to conceal her eventual fate.

Dr. Denis Flannery identifies a homoerotic subtext among male characters, particularly drawing parallels between David Mills and John Doe and the homoerotic undertones of David and Jonathan from the Hebrew Bible, in which Jonathan also dies before David. Additional allusions include Somerset being named after a gay author, Tracy questioning Somerset&#x27;s bachelor status, and Mills intentionally positioning Somerset at the opposite side of a table to avoid assumptions about their relationship. Flannery suggests a potential feminizing or transgendered implication for Doe, given that &quot;Doe&quot; is also a term for a female deer, and implications of romantic interest in Mills. According to Flannery, Spacey&#x27;s portrayal includes stereotypical homosexual inflections, and Doe&#x27;s failed attempt at assuming a traditional husband role with Tracy hints at his sexual complexities or inadequacies.

Allen acknowledges the difficulty in ascribing psychological truth to Doe. Spacey sees Doe as a truly evil and psychologically unfathomable individual. Author Shona Hill notes Somerset&#x27;s rejection of the idea that Doe&#x27;s actions are incomprehensible, asserting that Doe is not the Devil but merely a man. A key distinction lies in framing John Doe&#x27;s actions within a biblical context, giving them clear logic and purpose. During the final scene&#x27;s car ride, Somerset detects a baser motive in Doe, suggesting he takes pleasure in killing people. Mills, dismissive of Doe as a mentally unstable common criminal, aligns with criminologist Cesare Lombroso&#x27;s beliefs emphasizing psychological defects as the cause of criminal behavior. Oleson argues that Doe is the true architect of their narrative universe, dictating events while Mills and Somerset merely participate. Doe&#x27;s notebooks offer insight into his misanthropic worldview, revealing disdain for the city and extreme reactions to mundane urban interactions. Tambling interprets the name &quot;John Doe&quot; as an allegorical placeholder for &quot;Everyman&quot;, obscuring any true identity. Author David Deamer posits that Doe&#x27;s true identity is inconsequential compared to his purpose.

==Legacy==
===Modern reception===
In the years since its release, &quot;Seven&quot; has grown in esteem, receiving general critical praise, and being described by the British Film Institute (BFI) as a groundbreaking thriller. In a 2015 interview, Walker said that he remained proud of &quot;Seven&quot; despite criticisms from some audiences. In 2016, the BFI&#x27;s retrospective on &quot;Seven&quot; identified it as a landmark serial killer film. In the 2020s, &quot;MovieWeb&quot; and Stuff called &quot;Seven&quot; one of the most memorable and &quot;quintessential&quot; crime thrillers of the 1990s, representing a high point of the genre and filmmaking for the decade. Assessments by &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Collider&quot; wrote that &quot;Seven&quot; had an enduring appeal distinct from its contemporaries. This distinction is attributed to its bleak and seldom matched ending, as well as its stylized reality devoid of popular culture references or technological emphasis, ensuring it does not reflect any particular time or place. Richard Dyer featured &quot;Seven&quot; in the British Film Institute&#x27;s Film Classics series in 1999. &quot;Seven&quot; was also highlighted by critic Roger Ebert in his series, &quot;The Great Movies&quot;, in 2011, and it is included in the film reference book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;.

A 2014 poll of 2,120 entertainment industry professionals by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; ranked &quot;Seven&quot; the eighty-fifth-best film of all time. In audience-voted polls, &quot;Seven&quot; has been listed at number15 (2006), 30, and 37 (2023) on lists of the greatest films conducted by the publications &quot;Total Film&quot; and &quot;Empire&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot;″s 2008 poll of readers, Hollywood actors, and key film critics ranked &quot;Seven&quot; at number134 on its list of the 500 Greatest Movies of All Time, while &quot;Time Out&quot;″s 2022 staff poll ranked it number87.

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes offers a approval rating from the aggregated reviews of critics, with an average score of . The website&#x27;s critical consensus says: &quot;A brutal, relentlessly grimy shocker with taut performances, slick gore effects, and a haunting finale&quot;. The film has a score of 65 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 22 critics&#x27; reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

===Cultural influence===
Some publications considered &quot;Seven&quot; to be influential on filmmaking. Subsequent genre films and television shows, such as &quot;The Bone Collector&quot; (1999), &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; (2001), and the &quot;Saw&quot; series (2003), replicated &quot;Seven&quot;″s grim aesthetic, body horror imagery, and the premise of disenchanted detectives pursuing criminals with distinctive killing methods and motivations. It also served as an inspiration for the superhero film &quot;The Batman&quot; (2022), which Walker approved and was also a fan of the film. &quot;Collider&quot; credited &quot;Seven&quot; with a contemporary resurgence in Christianity-themed, supernatural, and apocalyptic mystery films. &quot;Seven&quot;″s use of non-mainstream music by Nine Inch Nails is also seen as contributing to increased use of similar songs in films such as &quot;Final Destination&quot; (2000) and &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (2002).

&quot;The New York Times&quot; called the title credit sequence for &quot;Seven&quot; &quot;one of the most important design innovations of the 1990s&quot;. In 2012, Art of the Title described it as the beginning of a &quot;renaissance&quot; in title design, particularly in the horror genre, and its influence is evident many years after &quot;Seven&quot;″s release. In 2011, IFC ranked the sequence as the third-best-ever behind those of &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958) and &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964), and its style can be seen in the opening credits of films such as &quot;Red Dragon&quot; (2002) and &quot;Taking Lives&quot; (2004).

&quot;Seven&quot; revitalized Fincher&#x27;s film career, establishing him among the most iconoclastic Hollywood directors of his generation. Over the next few years, he directed &quot;The Game&quot; (1997), &quot;Fight Club&quot; (1999), and &quot;Panic Room&quot; (2002), and collaborated on several other projects with Walker and Shore. &quot;Seven&quot; also helped Pitt&#x27;s transition into more serious and dramatic acting roles, including starring in Fincher&#x27;s &quot;Fight Club&quot;. Pitt and Paltrow also developed a romantic relationship while filming &quot;Seven&quot;. Freeman&#x27;s performance established him as a mentor-type figure archetype, which he would reprise in many later projects. In a 2022 interview, MacKay said &quot;Seven&quot; was still popular enough to be earning him &quot;healthy residual payments&quot;.

The film&#x27;s ending has been described as one of the most shocking and unforgettable plot twists in cinematic history. Pitt&#x27;s line &quot;What&#x27;s in the box?&quot; as he asks Somerset to confirm the contents of Doe&#x27;s box, has become iconic, and is used in popular culture and internet memes. Walker credited the twist as one of the primary reasons for &quot;Seven&quot;″s success. Although it is only implied that Tracy&#x27;s head is in the box, Fincher recalled an encounter with a woman who believed she had seen the contents of the box. Fincher believed that leaving the implication to the audience&#x27;s imagination had been more effective than showing a special effect. Paltrow wore a replica box over her head as her Halloween costume in 2017.

==Proposed sequel==

In 2002, New Line Cinema proposed a sequel named &quot;Ei8ht&quot; that would be based on a repurposed spec script titled &quot;Solace&quot; by Ted Griffin. The sequel would have focused on a psychic serial killer pursued by William Somerset, who would have developed similar psychic abilities. The idea was abandoned after principal &quot;Seven&quot; cast and crew, including Freeman and Pitt, expressed no intention to return for a sequel. Fincher said: &quot;I would be less interested in that than I would in having cigarettes put out in my eyes&quot;. The script was made into the standalone thriller named &quot;Solace&quot; (2015), which was a critical and commercial failure.

<text>Contortion (sometimes contortionism) is a performance art in which performers called contortionists showcase their skills of extreme physical flexibility. Contortion acts often accompany acrobatics, circus acts, street performers and other live performing arts. Contortion acts are typically performed in front of a live audience. An act will showcase one or more artists performing a choreographed set of moves or poses, often to music, which require extreme flexibility. The physical flexibility required to perform such acts greatly exceeds that of the general population. It is the dramatic feats of seemingly inhuman flexibility that captivate audiences.

==Skills==

Many factors affect the flexibility of performers including age, genetics, stature, and adherence to rigorous physical training routines. Most contortionists are generally categorized as &quot;frontbenders&quot; or &quot;backbenders&quot;, depending on the direction in which their spine is most flexible. Relatively few performers are equally adept at both.

Skills performed by contortionists include:
* Frontbending skills such as folding forward at the waist with the legs straight, or placing one or both legs behind the neck or shoulders with the knees bent (called a human knot).
* Backbending skills such as touching one&#x27;s head to one&#x27;s feet, or all the way to the buttocks (called a head-seat), while standing, lying on the floor, or in a handstand. A Marinelli bend is a backbend while supported only by a grip at the top of a short post that is held in the mouth.
* Splits and oversplits (a split of more than 180 degrees) may be included in frontbending or backbending acts. An oversplit may be performed while the feet are supported by two chairs or by two assistants.
* Enterology is the practice of squeezing one&#x27;s body into a small, knee-high box or other contained space which initially appears to audiences as being too small to contain the performer. Also known as ‘body packing’.
* Dislocations of the shoulders or hip joints are sometimes performed as a short novelty act by itself. One example is lifting the arm to the side until it passes behind the head and lies across the top of the shoulders; also referred to as bone breaking.
==Risks==
A medical publication from 2008 suggests that long-term damage to the spine, is common in long-term contortion practitioners. A study of five practitioners using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by Peoples et al. documented limbus vertebrae, intervertebral disc bulges, and disc degeneration. Three of the five practitioners also reported back pain.

==Performances==
Contortion acts are highly variable; many incorporate elements of humor, drama, shock, sensuality, or a blend of styles. Contortion may be incorporated into other types of performance, such as dance and theater.

* An adagio act is an acrobatic dance in which one partner lifts and carries the other partner as she/he performs splits and other flexible poses.
* In a rag doll or golliwogg act, one or two assistants bend, shake and carry the contortionist in such a way as to create the illusion that the disguised performer is actually a limp, life-sized doll. The act often ends by stuffing the doll into a small box.
* Contortion positions can be performed on a Spanish web, an aerial act consisting of a rope with a hand/foot loop that is spun by someone underneath.
* Contortionists might manipulate props during their performance, for instance spinning hula hoops or juggling rings, balancing towers of wine glasses, or playing a musical instrument - such as Max Smith, AKA &quot;The Musical Contortionist,&quot; a sideshow performer who played the banjo whilst in a series of contorted positions.

A contortionist may perform alone or may have one or two assistants, or up to four contortionists may perform together as a group.

In the past, contortionists were associated almost exclusively with circuses and fairs. More recently they have also been found performing in nightclubs, amusement parks, in magazine advertisements, at trade shows, on television variety shows, in music videos, and as warmup acts or in the background at music concerts.

The Ross Sisters were American contortionists most famous for their musical rendition of &#x27;Solid Potato Salad&#x27; in the 1944 movie &quot;Broadway Rhythm&quot;. In addition, contortion photos and digital movie clips are traded by fans on the Internet, and several web sites provide original photos of contortion acts for a monthly fee, or sell videotapes of performances through the mail.

Some loose-jointed people are able to pop a joint out of its socket without pain, thereby making it difficult to determine if a joint is dislocated without medical examination such as an X-ray. However, as long as the joint socket is the right shape, most extreme bends can be achieved without dislocating the joint. Actual dislocations are rarely used during athletic contortion acts since they make the joint more unstable and prone to injury, and a dislocated limb cannot lift itself or support any weight.

== History ==

The primary origins of contortion take place in Asian traditions. In China and Mongolia, traditional Buddhist Cham dances would incorporate contortion into their movement. The success of these dances then encouraged the act to expand into other forms of performance. Contortion also found similarities and expressions in the Hindu doctrine of yoga. Throughout daily meditation, yoga practitioners work to assume many similar poses to those in the performance-based contortion. The recognition of these similarities in various practices and thoughts brought contortion into more clear and explicit light. For those in the Chinese tradition, contortion is typically performed as a feat of acrobatics, used to dazzle the audience with the unusual shapes built before them. According to Chinese historical records, early contortionism originated in China during Western Zhou Dynasty (1045-771 BC), which matured in Sui Dynasty (581–618).

==Glossary==

* Backbend - Any pose with an unusual degree of backward bending at the waist and/or any portion of spine while standing, kneeling, resting on the floor, or while suspended.
* Box act (also called: body packing; enterology; packanatomicalization) - Circus act in which a contortionist squeezes his/her body into a small box or transparent container.
* Chest stand - Any backbending pose in which the performer&#x27;s chest is resting on the floor for support.
* Dislocate - 1. [verb] To injure a joint by temporarily forcing the bone out of its normal socket. 2. [noun] In men&#x27;s gymnastics, a rotating of the shoulders when performing a backwards turn on the still rings. Many skills in acrobatics appear to involve dislocating a joint, when they actually do not.
* Durvasa&#x27;s pose or crane pose - Named for the mythological Indian sage, Durvasa, who supposedly assumed this pose during his years of penance: to stand on one foot with the other leg lifted in front and placed behind the neck or shoulders.

* Elbow stand - Any inverted pose in which the performer uses only the forearms on the floor for support.
* Frontbend - Any pose that features an unusual degree of frontward bending of the waist and/or spine, either with the legs together or parted.
* Front split (also called: stride split) - A split in which one leg is extended frontward and the other leg is extended backward, both at right angles to the trunk. Ideally, the hips are square facing to the front, while both legs are turned out from the hips.
* Hairpin - A pose in which one kneels down, sits on top of the feet, and bends backwards until the top of the head comes into contact with the tailbone; it may also done with a starting position on hands and knees.
* Headsit - An extreme backbend in which the top of the performer&#x27;s head touches the buttocks; usually in a handstand or chest stand. Sometimes, a more extreme variation is done where the buttocks are positioned past the performer&#x27;s head, while the lower back is on top of the head; this requires much more neck flexibility.
* Leg shouldering - A standing split in which the leg touches the shoulder. Can be done to the front, side, or rear.
* Marinelli bend - [from contortionist and international theatrical agent H. B. Marinelli (1864–1924)] A headsit with the legs extended, performed while supported only by a leather mouth grip at the top of a short post.
* Needle scale - A front split while standing on the forward foot, with the torso bent downward with the hands touching the floor, while the rear leg is extended vertically toward the ceiling.
* Oversplit (also called: hypersplit) - Any split in which the angle formed by the legs measures greater than 180 degrees. It can be done to the front with either or both legs elevated, or in a straddle split with one or both legs elevated.
* Passive stretching (also called: static-passive stretching; assisted relaxed stretching) - 1. A static stretch (See: &quot;static stretching&quot;) in which an external force (such as the floor or another person) holds the performer in the static position. 2. The practice of having a relaxed limb moved beyond its normal range of motion with the assistance of a partner. In &quot;active stretching&quot;, in contrast, the limb is extended to its maximum range using only the muscles of that limb.
* Pike - To be bend forward at the waist with the legs and trunk kept straight.
* Pointe - In classical ballet, when a dancer uses special shoes (called pointe shoes or toe shoes) to dance en pointe (on their toes). The arch of the top of the foot is at its maximum when the dancer &quot;pushes over&quot;, causing the heel of the foot to be almost directly over the toes. Difficult and often painful to learn, both men and women may benefit from studying pointe technique; however, most performance opportunities are for women only. Children do not begin to study pointe until they have years of experience and sufficient ankle strength, as well as being old enough to ensure that their bones are strong enough.
* Ragdoll act (also known as a golliwogg act) - A type of circus performance in which a contortionist, dressed in a loose-fitting clown costume, appears to be a lifeless, floppy doll. One or two assistants manipulate the contortionist&#x27;s body, bending, rolling, and posing it in various ways, creating the illusion of a limp, inanimate object. The act culminates with the assistants squeezing the contortionist into a surprisingly small box, adding to the comedic and astonishing effect of the performance.
* Rhythmic gymnastics (also called: rhythmic sportive gymnastics (RSG); rhythmics) - Olympic sport for one woman (or 5 women in group competition) consisting of a balletic floor exercise which demonstrates leaps, turns, balance and flexibility while moving and tossing hand-held apparatus: a ball, a rope, a hoop, two clubs, or a ribbon. Men&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics currently exists in Japan, and is gaining worldwide acceptance.
* Rope act (also called: Spanish web) - Circus act in which an acrobat (usually female) performs exercises high above the floor while holding on to a long, vertically suspended rope, or hanging from a loop in the rope.
* Scale - In acrobatics, when the leg is raised toward the back and may be held with one hand while standing.
* Split (also called: the splits) - Any pose in which the legs are extended in opposite directions such that the angle of the legs is 180 degrees.
* Straddle split (also called: side split; box split; Chinese split; cut split) - A split in which the legs are extended to the left and right, until a 180 degree angle between the legs is reached.
* Tortoise position (also called: pancake) - A seated forward bend with the chest against the floor between the legs; the outstretched arms are also against the floor and underneath the knees.
* Triple fold - A variation of a chest stand where the knees bend and lower all the way down to the ground, allowing the shins to lie flat on the floor, resulting in a stacked position with three distinct layers: the chest, the thighs, and the shins, all aligned and in contact with the floor.
* Twisting split - An exercise in which the performer changes from a split with the left leg forward, to a straddle split, and then to a split with the right leg forward, by rotating the legs, and without using the hands for support.

<text>The Mogao Caves, also known as the Thousand Buddha Grottoes or Caves of the Thousand Buddhas, form a system of 500 temples southeast of the center of Dunhuang, an oasis located at a religious and cultural crossroads on the Silk Road, in Gansu province, China. The caves may also be known as the Dunhuang Caves; however, this term is also used as a collective term to include other Buddhist cave sites in and around the Dunhuang area, such as the Western Thousand Buddha Caves, Eastern Thousand Buddha Caves, Yulin Caves, and Five Temple Caves. The caves contain some of the finest examples of Buddhist art spanning a period of 1,000 years. The first caves were dug out in 366 CE as places of Buddhist meditation and worship; later the caves became a place of pilgrimage, and caves continued to be built at the site until the 14th century. The Mogao Caves are the best known of the Chinese Buddhist grottoes and, along with Longmen Grottoes and Yungang Grottoes, are one of the three famous ancient Buddhist sculptural sites of China.

An important cache of documents was discovered in 1900 in the so-called &quot;Library Cave&quot;, which had been walled-up in the 11th century. The contents of the library were subsequently dispersed around the world, and the largest collections are now found in Beijing, London, Paris and Berlin, and the International Dunhuang Project exists to coordinate and collect scholarly work on the Dunhuang manuscripts and other material. The caves themselves are now a popular tourist destination, but the number of visitors has been capped to help with the preservation of the caves.

== Etymology ==
The caves are commonly referred to in Chinese as the Caves of the Thousand Buddhas (), a name that some scholars have speculated to have come from the legend of its founding, when a monk Yuezun had a vision of a thousand Buddhas at the site. This name, however, may have come from the large number of Buddha figures at the site, or the miniatures figures painted on the walls of these caves as these figures are called &quot;thousand Buddhas&quot; colloquially. The name Mogao Caves () was used in the Tang dynasty, where &#x27;Mogao&#x27; refers to an administrative district at the site during the Tang dynasty. Mogao may mean &quot;peerless&quot; (literally &quot;none higher&quot;, where &quot;mo&quot; means &quot;none&quot;, and &quot;gao&quot; means &quot;high&quot;); an alternative reading may be &quot;high in the desert&quot; if &quot;mo&quot; is read as a variant of the Chinese term for &quot;desert&quot;. Mogao is also used as the name of a modern town that is administered by Dunhuang city: Mogao Town (). The Mogao Caves are also often referred to as the Dunhuang Caves after the nearest city Dunhuang, which means &quot;blazing beacon&quot; as beacons were used at the frontier outpost to warn of attacks by nomadic tribes. The term Dunhuang Caves however is also used in a broader sense as a collective term for all the caves found in or around the Dunhuang area.

== History ==

Dunhuang was established as a frontier garrison outpost by the Han dynasty Emperor Wudi to protect against the Xiongnu in 111 BC. It also became an important gateway to the West, a centre of commerce along the Silk Road, as well as a meeting place of various people and religions such as Buddhism. The Mogao Caves near Dunhuang were first constructed in the 4th century AD and were used as a site of Buddhist worship and pilgrimage. The caves contain over 400,000 square feet of frescoes and sculptures, making them one of the largest repositories of Buddhist art in the world.

The construction of the Mogao Caves is generally taken to have begun sometime in the fourth century AD, when Dunhuang was under control of the Former Liang dynasty. According to a book written during the reign of Tang Empress Wu, &quot;Fokan Ji&quot; (, &quot;An Account of Buddhist Shrines&quot;) by Li Junxiu (), a Buddhist monk named Lè Zūn (, which may also be pronounced Yuezun) had a vision of a thousand Buddhas bathed in golden light at the site in 366 AD, inspiring him to build a cave here. The story is also found in other sources, such as in inscriptions on a stele in cave 332; an earlier date of 353 however was given in another document, &quot;Shazhou Tujing&quot; (, &quot;Geography of Shazhou&quot;). He was later joined by a second monk Faliang (), and the site gradually grew, by the time of the Northern Liang a small community of monks had formed at the site. The caves initially served only as a place of meditation for hermit monks, but developed to serve the monasteries that sprang up nearby.

The earliest decorated Mogao Caves remaining to this day (caves 268, and ), were built and decorated in the Northern Liang period between 419 and 439 CE, before the invasion of the Northern Wei. They share many stylistic characteristics in common with some of the Kizil Caves, such as . Members of the ruling family of Northern Wei and Northern Zhou then constructed many caves here, and it flourished in the short-lived Sui dynasty. By the Tang dynasty, the number of caves had reached over a thousand.
By the Sui and Tang dynasties, Mogao Caves had become a place of worship and pilgrimage for the public. From the 4th until the 14th century, caves were constructed by monks to serve as shrines with funds from donors. These caves were elaborately painted, the cave paintings and architecture serving as aids to meditation, as visual representations of the quest for enlightenment, as mnemonic devices, and as teaching tools to inform those illiterate about Buddhist beliefs and stories. The major caves were sponsored by patrons such as important clergy, local ruling elite, foreign dignitaries, as well as Chinese emperors. Other caves may have been funded by merchants, military officers, and other local people such as women&#x27;s groups.

During the Tang dynasty, Dunhuang became the main hub of commerce of the Silk Road and a major religious centre. A large number of the caves were constructed at Mogao during this era, including the two large statues of Buddha at the site, the largest one constructed in 695 following an edict a year earlier by Tang Empress Wu Zetian to build giant statues across the country. The site escaped the persecution of Buddhists ordered by Emperor Wuzong in 845 as it was then under Tibetan control. As a frontier town, Dunhuang had been occupied at various times by other non-Han Chinese people. After the Tang dynasty, the site went into a gradual decline, and construction of new caves ceased entirely after the Yuan dynasty. By then Islam had conquered much of Central Asia, and the Silk Road declined in importance when trading via sea-routes began to dominate Chinese trade with the outside world. During the Ming dynasty, the Silk Road was finally officially abandoned, and Dunhuang slowly became depopulated and largely forgotten by the outside world. Most of the Mogao caves were abandoned; the site, however, was still a place of pilgrimage and was used as a place of worship by local people at the beginning of the twentieth century when there was renewed interest in the site.

=== Discovery and revival ===

During late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, Western explorers began to show interest in the ancient Silk Road and the lost cities of Central Asia, and those who passed through Dunhuang noted the murals, sculptures, and artifacts such as the Stele of Sulaiman at Mogao. There is an estimated half a million square feet of religious wall murals within the caves. The biggest discovery, however, came from a Chinese Taoist named Wang Yuanlu who had appointed himself guardian of some of these temples around the turn of the century and tried to raise funds to repair the statues.

Some of the caves had by then been blocked by sand, and Wang set about clearing away the sand and made an attempt at restoration of the site. In one such cave, on 25 June 1900, Wang followed the drift of smoke from a cigarette, and discovered a walled up area behind one side of a corridor leading to a main cave. Behind the wall was a small cave stuffed with an enormous hoard of manuscripts. In the next few years, Wang took some manuscripts to show to various officials who expressed varying level of interest, but in 1904 Wang re-sealed the cave following an order by the governor of Gansu concerned about the cost of transporting these documents.
Words of Wang&#x27;s discovery drew the attention of a joint British/Indian group led by the Hungarian-born British archaeologist Aurel Stein who was on an archaeological expedition in the area in 1907. Stein negotiated with Wang to allow him to remove a significant number of manuscripts as well as the finest paintings and textiles in exchange for a donation to Wang&#x27;s restoration effort. He was followed by a French expedition under Paul Pelliot who acquired many thousands of items in 1908, and then by a Japanese expedition under Otani Kozui in 1911 and a Russian expedition under Sergei F. Oldenburg in 1914. A well-known scholar Luo Zhenyu edited some of the manuscripts Pelliot acquired into a volume which was then published in 1909 as &quot;Manuscripts of the Dunhuang Caves&quot; ().

Stein and Pelliot provoked much interest in the West about the Dunhuang Caves. Scholars in Beijing, after seeing samples of the documents in Pelliot&#x27;s possession, became aware of their value. Concerned that the remaining manuscripts might be lost, Luo Zhenyu and others persuaded the Ministry of Education to recover the rest of the manuscripts to be sent to Peking (Beijing) in 1910. However, not all the remaining manuscripts were taken to Peking, and of those retrieved, some were then stolen. Rumours of caches of documents taken by local people continued for some time, and a cache of documents hidden by Wang from the authorities was later found in the 1940s. Some of the caves were damaged and vandalized by White Russian soldiers when they were used by the local authority in 1921 to house Russian soldiers fleeing the civil war following the Russian Revolution. In 1924, American explorer Langdon Warner removed a number of murals as well as a statue from some of the caves. In 1939 Kuomintang soldiers stationed at Dunhuang caused some damage to the murals and statues at the site.

The situation improved in 1941 when, following a visit by Wu Zuoren to the site the previous year, the painter Zhang Daqian arrived at the caves with a small team of assistants and stayed for two and a half years to repair and copy the murals. He exhibited and published the copies of the murals in 1943, which helped to publicize and give much prominence to the art of Dunhuang within China. Historian Xiang Da then persuaded Yu Youren, a prominent member of the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party), to set up an institution, the Research Institute of Dunhuang Art (which later became the Dunhuang Academy), at Mogao in 1944 to look after the site and its contents. In 1956, the first Premier of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, took a personal interest in the caves and sanctioned a grant to repair and protect the site; and in 1961, the Mogao Caves were declared to be a specially protected historical monument by the State Council, and large-scale renovation work at Mogao began soon afterwards. The site escaped the widespread damage caused to many religious sites during the Cultural Revolution.

Today, efforts are continuing to conserve and research the site and its content. The Mogao Caves became one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1987. From 1988 to 1995 a further 248 caves were discovered to the north of the 487 caves known since the early 1900s.

The Dunhuang Academy entered a period of &quot;scientific conservation&quot; for the Mogao Caves in the 1980s and began exploring &quot;digital conservation&quot; as early as 1993. Since 2010, it has completed photographic acquisition of 120 caves, image processing of 40 caves, panoramic roaming of 120 caves, and 3D reconstruction of 20 painted sculptures in the Mogao Caves. The Dunhuang Academy also introduced I-m-Cave, a multi-touch desktop system for virtual tours of the Mogao Caves, which presents a relationship between currently damaged artifacts and their virtual restored versions that cannot be experienced during a real tour.

== The Library Cave ==
Cave 17 discovered by Wang Yuanlu in the early 1900s came to be known as the Library Cave. It is located off the entrance leading to cave 16 and was originally used as a memorial cave for a local monk Hongbian on his death in 862. Hongbian, from a wealthy Wu family, was responsible for the construction of cave 16, and the Library Cave may have been used as his retreat in his lifetime. The cave originally contained his statue which was moved to another cave when it was used to keep manuscripts, some of which bear Hongbian&#x27;s seal. A large number of documents dating from 406 to 1002 were found in the cave, heaped up in closely packed layers of bundles of scrolls. In addition to the 1,100 bundles of scrolls, there were also over 15,000 paper books and shorter texts, including a Hebrew penitential prayer (&quot;selichah&quot;) (see Dunhuang manuscripts). It&#x27;s estimated that 50,000 ancient documents were discovered inside on topics of literature, philosophy, art and medicine. The Library Cave also contained textiles such as banners, numerous damaged figurines of Buddhas, and other Buddhist paraphernalia. According to Stein who was the first to describe the cave in its original state:
The Library Cave was walled off sometime early in the 11th century. A number of theories have been proposed as the reason for sealing the caves. Stein first proposed that the cave had become a waste repository for venerable, damaged and used manuscripts and hallowed paraphernalia and then sealed perhaps when the place came under threat. Following this interpretation some suggested that the handwritten manuscripts of the Tripitaka became obsolete when printing became widespread, the older manuscripts were therefore stored away. Another suggestion is that the cave was simply used as a book storehouse for documents which accumulated over a century and a half, then sealed up when it became full.
Others, such as Pelliot, suggested an alternative scenario, that the monks hurriedly hid the documents in advance of an attack by invaders, perhaps when Xi Xia invaded in 1035. This theory was proposed in light of the absence of documents from Xi Xia and the disordered state in which Pelliot found the room (perhaps a misinterpretation because unbeknownst to him the room was disturbed by Stein months before). Another theory posits that the items were from a monastic library and hidden due to threats from Muslims who were moving eastward. This theory proposes that the monks of a nearby monastery heard about the fall of the Buddhist kingdom of Khotan to Karakhanids invaders from Kashgar in 1006 and the destruction it caused, so they sealed their library to avoid it being destroyed. Another possible theory posits that to save the manuscripts from a coming &quot;Age of Decline&quot;, the Library Cave was sealed to prevent this from occurring.

The date of the sealing of the cave continued to be debated. Rong (2000) provided evidence to support 1002 as the date for sealing the cave, while Huntington (1986) supported a closing around the early to mid-thirteen century. It is difficult to determine the state of the materials found since the chamber was not opened &quot;under scientific conditions&quot;, so critical evidence to support dating the closure was lost. The latest date recorded in the documents found in the cave is believed to be 1002, and although some have proposed later dates for some of the documents, the cave was likely to have been sealed not long after that date.

===Dunhuang manuscripts===

The manuscripts from the Library Cave date from fifth century until early eleventh century when it was sealed. Up to 50,000 manuscripts may have been kept there, one of the greatest treasure troves of ancient documents found. While most of them are in Chinese, a large number of documents are in various other languages such as Tibetan, Uighur, Sanskrit, and Sogdian, including the then little-known Khotanese. They may be old hemp paper scrolls in Chinese and many other languages, Tibetan pothis, and paintings on hemp, silk or paper. The subject matter of the great majority of the scrolls is Buddhist in nature, but it also covers a diverse material. Along with the expected Buddhist canonical works are original commentaries, apocryphal works, workbooks, books of prayers, Confucian works, Taoist works, Christian works, works from the Chinese government, administrative documents, anthologies, glossaries, dictionaries, and calligraphic exercises.

Many of the manuscripts were previously unknown or thought lost, and the manuscripts provide a unique insight into the religious and secular matters of Northern China as well as other Central Asian kingdoms from the early periods up to the Tang and early Song dynasty. The manuscripts found in the Library Cave include the earliest dated printed book, the Diamond Sutra from 868, which was first translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the fourth century. These scrolls also include manuscripts that ranged from the Christian Jingjiao Documents to the Dunhuang Go Manual and ancient music scores, as well as the image of the Chinese astronomy Dunhuang map. These scrolls chronicle the development of Buddhism in China, record the political and cultural life of the time, and provide documentation of mundane secular matters that gives a rare glimpse into the lives of ordinary people of these eras.

The manuscripts were dispersed all over the world in the aftermath of the discovery. Stein&#x27;s acquisition was split between Britain and India because his expedition was funded by both countries. Stein had the first pick and he was able to collect around 7,000 complete manuscripts and 6,000 fragments for which he paid £130, although these include many duplicate copies of the Diamond and Lotus Sutras. Pelliot took almost 10,000 documents for the equivalent of £90, but, unlike Stein, Pelliot was a trained sinologist literate in Chinese, and he was allowed to examine the manuscripts freely, so he was able to pick a better selection of documents than Stein. Pelliot was interested in the more unusual and exotic of the Dunhuang manuscripts, such as those dealing with the administration and financing of the monastery and associated lay men&#x27;s groups. Many of these manuscripts survived only because they formed a type of palimpsest whereby papers were reused and Buddhist texts were written on the opposite side of the paper. Hundreds more of the manuscripts were sold by Wang to Otani Kozui and Sergei Oldenburg. Efforts are now underway to reconstitute the Library Cave manuscripts digitally, and they are now available as part of International Dunhuang Project.

==Art==
The art of Dunhuang covers more than ten major genres, such as architecture, stucco sculpture, wall paintings, silk paintings, calligraphy, woodblock printing, embroidery, literature, music and dance, and popular entertainment.

===Architecture===
The caves are examples of rock-cut architecture, but unlike Longmen Grottoes and Yungang Grottoes, the local rock is a rather soft gravel conglomerate that is not suitable for either sculpture or elaborate architectural details. Many of the early caves were developed from earlier Buddhist rock-cut &quot;chaitya&quot; styles seen in places such as the Ajanta Caves in India, with a square-sectioned central column, with sculpture in niches, representing the stupa round which worshippers may circumambulate (&quot;parikrama&quot;) and gain blessings. Others are hall caves influenced by traditional Chinese and Buddhist temple architecture. These caves may have a truncated pyramidal ceiling sometimes painted to resemble a tent, or they may have a flat or gabled ceiling that imitates traditional buildings. Some of the caves used for meditation are adaptations of the Indian vihara (monastery) cave plan and contain side-chambers just large enough for one person to sit in.

Many of the caves originally had wooden porches or fore-temples built out from the cliff, but most of these have decayed or been lost in other ways, with only five remaining, the two earliest of which are rare surviving examples of Song dynasty wooden architecture. The most prominent wooden building at the site, first built during the Tang dynasty, houses the Great Buddha and was originally four storeys high, but it has been repaired at least five times and is no longer the original structure. A storey was added between 874 and 885, then repaired in the Guiyijun period, and two further storeys were added during a restoration in 1898. Two further restorations were carried out in the 20th century, and the building is now a 9-storey structure.

===Murals===

The murals in the caves date from a period of over a thousand years, from the 5th to the 14th century, and many earlier ones were repainted at later points within the period. The murals are extensive, covering an area of . The most fully painted caves have paintings all over the walls and ceilings, with geometrical or plant decoration filling the spaces not taken by figurative images, which are above all of the Buddha. Sculpture is also brightly painted. The murals are valued for the scale and richness of content as well as their artistry. Buddhist subjects are most common, however some have traditional mythical subjects and portraits of patrons. These murals document the changing styles of Buddhist art in China for nearly a thousand years. The artistry of the murals reached its apogee during the Tang period, and the quality of the work dropped after the tenth century.
Early murals showed a strong Indian and Central Asian influence in the painting techniques used, the composition and style of the paintings as well as costumes worn by the figures, but a distinct Dunhuang style began to emerge during the Northern Wei dynasty. Motifs of Chinese, Central Asian and Indian origin may be found in a single cave, and Chinese elements increased during the Western Wei period.

A common motif in many caves is the areas entirely covered by rows of small seated Buddha figures, after which this and other &quot;Thousand Buddhas Caves&quot; are named. These small Buddhas were drawn using stencils so that identical figures may be replicated. Flying apsaras, or celestial beings may be depicted in the ceiling or above the Buddhas, and figures of donors may be shown along the bottom of the walls. The paintings often depict jataka tales which are stories of the life of Buddha, or avadana which are parables of the doctrine of karma. The murals may also depict religious themes.

Bodhisattvas started appearing during the Northern Zhou period, with Avalokitesvara (Guanyin), which was originally male but acquired female characteristics later, the most popular. Most caves show Mahayana and Sravakayana (Theravada or Hinayana) influences, although Mahayana Buddhism became the dominant form during the Sui dynasty. An innovation of the Sui-Tang period is the visual representation of the sutra – Mahayana Buddhist teachings transformed into large complete and detailed narrative paintings. One of the central features of Tang art in Mogao is the representation of the paradise of the Pure Land, indicating the increasing popularity of this school of Mahayana Buddhism in the Tang era. The &quot;Western Paradise Illustration&quot; of Cave 220 is a well-preserved mural of this type. The iconography of Tantric Buddhism, such as the eleven-headed or thousand-armed Avalokitesvara, also started to appear in Mogao wall paintings during the Tang period. It became popular during the Tibetan occupation of Dunhuang and the subsequent periods, especially during the Yuan dynasty.
While Buddhist art is stylistically distinct from secular art, the style of paintings in the caves often reflects that of contemporary secular painting (insofar as we know of this), especially those depicting secular scenes. Donor figures are generally depicted in secular style, and may include secular events associated with them. For example, scenes depicting General Zhang Yichao, who ruled over Dunhuang in a quasi-autonomous manner during the Late Tang period, include a commemoration of his victory over the Tibetans in 848. The portraits of donors increased in size during the period ruled by the Cao family who succeeded the Zhang family. The Caos formed alliances with the Uyghurs (Uyghur Gansu Kingdom and Kingdom of Qocho) and the Saka Kingdom of Khotan and their portraits are featured prominently in some of the caves.
Many of the figures have darkened due to oxidation of the lead-based pigments from exposure to air and light. Many early figures in the murals in Dunhuang also used painting techniques originated from India where shading was applied to achieve a three-dimensional or chiaroscuro effect. However, the darkening of the paint used in shading over time resulted in heavy outlines which is not what the painters had originally intended. This shading technique is unique to Dunhuang in East Asia at this period as such shading on human faces was generally not done in Chinese paintings until much later when there were influences from European paintings. Another difference from traditional Chinese painting is the presence of figures that are semi-nude, occasionally fully nude, as figures are generally fully clothed in Chinese paintings. Many of the murals have been repaired or plastered over and repainted over the centuries, and older murals may be seen where sections of later paintings had been removed.

The Getty Conservation Institute has a dedicated page to the conservation of those wall paintings.

===Sculptures===
There are around 2,400 surviving clay sculptures at Mogao. These were first constructed on a wooden frame, padded with reed, then modelled in clay stucco, and finished with paint. The giant statues however have a stone core. The Buddha is generally shown as the central statue, often attended by boddhisattvas, heavenly kings, devas, and apsaras, along with yaksas and other mythical creatures. 
The early figures are relatively simple and mainly of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The Buddhas of Northern Wei may have two attendant Bodhisattvas, and in the Northern Zhou period, two further disciples may be added, forming a group of five. Figures from the Sui and Tang periods may be present as larger groups of seven or nine, and some showed large-scale parinirvana scene with groups of mourners. The early sculptures were based on Indian and Central Asian prototypes, with some in the Greco-Indian style of Gandhara. Over time the sculptures showed more Chinese elements and became gradually sinicized.

The two giant statues represent Maitreya Buddha. The earlier and larger one in cave 96, at 35.5 m high, was constructed in 695 under the edicts from Empress Wu Zetian who instructed the constructions of monasteries in 689 and giant statues in 694. The smaller one is 27 m tall and was constructed in 713–41. The larger northern giant Buddha was damaged in an earthquake and had been repaired and restored multiple times, consequently its clothing, colour and gestures had been changed and only the head retains its original Early Tang appearance. The southern statue however is largely in its original form apart for its right hand. The larger Buddha is housed in a prominent wooden 9-storey structure.
One type of cave constructed during the Tibetan era is the Nirvana Cave, which features a large reclining Buddha that covers the entire length of the hall. Figures of mourners in murals or in sculptural forms are also depicted along the length of the hall behind the Buddha. The Buddha figure in cave 158 measures 15.6 m long.

The original function of the &quot;Library Cave&quot; was as a shrine commemorating Hong Bian, the 9th-century monk. His portrait statue, unusual here and among all surviving works in China, was removed to another spot when the cave was sealed up in the 11th century, but has been returned now the library has been removed. There is also a stone stele describing his life, and the wall behind the statue is painted with attendant figure; such blending of painted sculpture and wall paintings into a single composition is very common at the site.

===Paintings on silk and paper===
Before the discovery in the Library Cave, original paintings on silk and paper from the Tang dynasty, an influential period in Chinese art, were very rare, and most of the surviving examples were copies made in later periods. Over a thousand paintings on silk, banners, and embroideries were found in the Library Cave, none apparently dating before the late 7th century. The great majority of the paintings are anonymous, but many are of high quality, especially from the Tang. Most are sutra paintings, images of Buddha, and narrative paintings. The paintings show something of the contemporary Chinese style of the capital Chang&#x27;an, but many also reflect Indian, Tibetan and Uighur painting styles.

There are brush paintings in ink alone, some in just two colours, as well as many in full colour. Most common are single figures, and most paintings were probably donated by an individual, who is often portrayed on a diminutive scale. The donor figures become notably more elaborate in dress by the 10th century.

===Printed images===

The Library Cave is equally important as a source of rare early images and texts produced by woodblock printing, including the famous Diamond Sutra, the earliest printed book to survive. Other printed images were made to be hung, often with text below containing prayers and sometimes a dedication by the pious commissioner; at least two prints were commissioned by Cao Yuanzhong, Imperial Commissioner at Dunhuang in 947. Many of the images have colour added by hand to the printed outline. Several sheets contain repeated impressions of the same block with a Buddha image. Possibly these reflect stock for cutting when sold to pilgrims, but inscriptions in some examples show these were also printed out at different times by an individual as a devotion to acquire merit. It is unclear whether such people owned their own blocks, or visited a monastery to have the images printed.

===Textiles===
The textiles found in the Library Cave include silk banners, altar hangings, wrappings for manuscripts, and monks&#x27; apparel (kāṣāya). The monks normally used fabrics consisting of a patchwork of different scraps of cloth as a sign of humility; these therefore provide valuable insights into the various type of silk cloth and embroidery available at the time. Silk banners were used to adorn the cliff-face at the caves during festivals, and these are painted and may be embroidered. Valances used to decorate altars and temples had a horizontal strip at the top, from which hung streamers made from strips of different cloths ending in a V that look like a modern male necktie.

==Caves==

The caves were cut into the side of a cliff which is close to two kilometers long. At its height, during the Tang dynasty, there were more than a thousand caves, but over time many of the caves were lost, including the earliest caves. 735 caves currently exist in Mogao; the best-known ones are the 487 caves located in the southern section of the cliff which are places of pilgrimage and worship. 248 caves have also been found to the north which were living quarters, meditation chambers, and burial sites for the monks. The caves at the southern section are decorated, while those at the northern section are mostly plain.

The caves are clustered together according to their era, with new caves from a new dynasty being constructed in different parts of the cliff. From the murals, sculptures, and other objects found in the caves, the dates of around five hundred caves have been determined. Following is a list of the caves by era, compiled in the 1980s (more have been identified since):

* Sixteen Kingdoms (366–439) - 7 caves, the oldest dated to Northern Liang period.
* Northern Wei (439–534) and Western Wei (535-556) - 10 from each phase
* Northern Zhou (557–580) - 15 caves
* Sui dynasty (581–618) - 70 caves
* Early Tang (618–704) - 44 caves
* High Tang (705–780) - 80 caves
* Middle Tang (781–847) - 44 caves (This era in Dunhuang is also known as the Tibetan period because Dunhuang was then under Tibetan occupation.)
* Guiyijun period (, 848–1036), when Dunhuang was ruled by the Zhang and Cao families. It may be subdivided into the following periods:
:* Late Tang (848–906) - 60 caves 
:* The Five Dynasties (907–960) - 32 caves
:* Song dynasty (960–1035) - 43 caves
* Western Xia (1036–1226) - 82 caves
* Yuan dynasty (1227–1368) - 10 caves

<text>Man in the Hills is a reggae album by Jamaican musician Burning Spear (Winston Rodney), released in 1976 (see 1976 in music) on Island Records. &quot;Man in the Hills&quot; was follow-up to the seminal &quot;Marcus Garvey&quot;; &quot;Man in the Hills&quot; is usually considered a worthy follow-up, though less innovative and incendiary. produced by Jack Ruby, &quot;Man in the Hills&quot; is a simple and unadorned album, with songs that reminisce about Spear&#x27;s childhood in St. Anne&#x27;s Bay, Jamaica.

&quot;Door Peep&quot; was originally recorded in 1969 at Studio One after Spear ran into Bob Marley (also from St. Anne&#x27;s Bay); Spear later quotes Marley &quot;And Bob was going to his farm. The man was moving with a donkey and some buckets and a fork, and cutlass and plants. We just reason man-to-man and I-man say wherein I would like to get involved in the music business. And Bob say, &#x27;All right, just check Studio One.&#x27; &quot; The single was released but fared poorly on the Jamaican charts.

After &quot;Marcus Garvey&quot;, Spear&#x27;s fame had grown considerably, and he was a star in Jamaica and cult sensation in the United Kingdom. &quot;Man in the Hills&quot; was a much quieter and more restrained album than its predecessor, and was more pastoral and dreamlike than militant and radical (though songs like &quot;Is It Good&quot; and &quot;No More War&quot; continue to address social issues).

&quot;Man in the Hills&quot;, the titular album opener evokes the superiority of rural living over urban. In Jamaican history, the roots of radical protest, a national identity and the Rastafari movement, grew from communities formed by escaped slaves in the hills and (after emancipation in 1838) the so-called &quot;Free Villages&quot;.

<text>The Scheldt–Rhine Canal (Schelde-Rijnkanaal) in Belgium and the Netherlands connects Antwerp with the Volkerak, and thereby the Scheldt with the Rhine.

==Route==
The canal starts close to the Scheldt river, at the port of Antwerp, and generally runs north. After it passes the Dutch-Belgian border, it serves as the border between the Dutch provinces of North Brabant and Zeeland. Just north of Zuid-Beveland ships have to pass the to enter the lower part of the canal. Just north of the sluices the canal enters the artificial and leaves this lake again as a canalised section of the former Eendracht strait, before terminating in the Volkerak estuary. Here, the provide access to the Rhine-Meuse Delta and the port of Rotterdam.

==History==
During the 1920s the Belgian government demanded a replacement for the Canal through Zuid-Beveland, to keep the port of Antwerp accessible for the lucrative Rhine trade. According to the original plan, the new canal was supposed to connect Antwerp directly to Moerdijk on the Hollands Diep, but after the Second World War and the North Sea flood of 1953 the Dutch government decided that the new canal should be part of the Delta Works and proposed a more westerly route, in fact it would take the same route as the ancient Striene river. After the Belgian government agreed in 1963, work on the canal began.

In order to keep the canal free of tides, two dams were built to separate the tidal Oosterschelde from the Scheldt-Rhine canal. These are the Oesterdam (resulting in the creation of the Zoommeer) and the Philipsdam (that turned the Volkerak estuary into a freshwater lake).

==Bridges==
It crosses the east of Zuid-Beveland, where it is crossed by a railroad bridge (between the stations Rilland-Bath on the west and Bergen op Zoom on the east) and three road bridges, and along Tholen, where it is spanned by three road bridges.

<text>Sixteen Stone is the debut studio album by English rock band Bush, released 1 November 1994 by Trauma and Interscope Records. It became the band&#x27;s most popular album, peaking at number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and boasting numerous successful singles. &quot;Comedown&quot; and &quot;Glycerine&quot; remain two of Bush&#x27;s biggest hits to date, each reaching number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Comedown&quot;, &quot;Machinehead&quot;, and &quot;Glycerine&quot; were the three songs from the album to enter the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, reaching number thirty, number forty-three, and number twenty-eight, respectively. The album was certified 6× Platinum in the United States by the RIAA on 16 April 1997. Although notably less successful in the band&#x27;s native Britain, the album was nonetheless certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry.

Featuring a rock sound characterised by guitar distortion and quiet interludes, the album quickly invited comparisons to Seattle grunge bands, particularly Nirvana, who had disbanded earlier in 1994 due to the suicide of Kurt Cobain. The purported similarities between the band&#x27;s sound and Nirvana&#x27;s was the subject of significant media attention. Lyrical themes on the album included adversity and criticism of masculine stereotypes, as well as relationships and terrorism.

To mark its twentieth anniversary, a remastered edition of the album was released on 14 October 2014. &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot; charted 59th in the &quot;Billboard&quot; decade end chart for 1990-1999, and ranked 8th on &quot;Guitar World&quot;&#x27;s 2014 list &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot;.

== Recording and background ==
The seeds of the album were sown prior to Rossdale, previously of the band Midnight, first meeting future Bush bandmate Nigel Pulsford in 1991, when Rossdale wrote &quot;Comedown&quot;, the first ever song he had written by himself, which would later reach Number 1 on the Billboard Alternative Airplay charts.

&quot;Sixteen Stone&quot; was recorded in 1994 at Westway Records in London, and produced by Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley. In 1999, Gavin Rossdale explained that the decision to have Langer produce the record was brought about by Langer simply being English, and by his work co-writing the song &quot;Shipbuilding&quot; with Elvis Costello. Rossdale initially wanted Steve Albini to work on &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot;. Albini would engineer the band&#x27;s next album &quot;Razorblade Suitcase&quot;. Guitarist Nigel Pulsford told BBC Cymru Wales in 2009 that the decision to have Langer and Winstanley work on the record was due to sensitivities around the band sounding too American; Pulsford said &quot;it became apparent that we had a definite American bent to our sound which is why we choose [Langer and Winstanley] to produce our first album in the hope that they would make us sound more British&quot;. The album was originally scheduled to be released in January 1995, but was released 2 months earlier as radio stations began playing &quot;Everything Zen&quot; and &quot;Little Things&quot;.

Guitarist Nigel Pulsford&#x27;s father and Rossdale&#x27;s stepfather died around the time the album was recorded. &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot; is dedicated to both.

Some time prior to release, the band, known previously as Future Primitive, became known as Bush after Carson convinced the band that a shortened name would be more suitable for a CD. Prior to the name-change the song &quot;Bomb&quot; (which would later appear on the album) had been released as a single under the &quot;Future Primitive&quot; name, as had an untitled promo version of the album itself. David Carson designed the album artwork and packaging for the album. &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot; was delivered to Trauma Records in early April 1994, and released on 1 November that year through the label. Rossdale has stated that the reason &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot;&#x27;s release through Trauma was delayed was the label&#x27;s distributor, Hollywood Records, opining that the record contained &quot;no singles&quot; and &quot;no album tracks&quot;.

== Content ==
=== Style and influences ===
The music of &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot; has been characterized variously as grunge, hard rock and post-grunge, and has been compared with the music of 1990s Seattle-based bands including Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden; the song &quot;Bomb&quot; in particular invited a description of &quot;Nirvana-approximating&quot; from &quot;Stereogum&quot;. In relation to the reputed similarities between &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot; and Nirvana, Gavin Rossdale told &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 1997 that he believed the influence was only obvious on the song &quot;Little Things&quot;, commenting &quot;you&#x27;ve got one chord progression and a kind of different rhythm in the chorus, which is the same effect you get with Nirvana&quot; further commenting &quot;if you listen to &quot;Smells like Teen Spirit&quot; and then listen to [the Pixies] &quot;Debaser&quot;, it&#x27;s the same thing&quot;. Other influences noted by critics included the musical similarities between &quot;Everything Zen&quot; and Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; (1989) and the resemblance borne between the riff on &quot;Body&quot; and that on the Soundgarden song &quot;Rusty Cage&quot; (1991).

The styles on the record include the rock ballad of &quot;Glycerine&quot;, the Ramones-indebted punk rock of &quot;X-Girlfriend&quot;, and what &quot;Stereogum&quot; described as &quot;groove-grunge&quot; on &quot;Comedown&quot; and &quot;Body&quot;, the latter being described by &quot;SoundVapours&quot; as &quot;the perfect mix&quot; of Black Sabbath and Soundgarden.

Reflecting on the influences on &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot;, Gavin Rossdale cited seeing bands including Jane&#x27;s Addiction, My Bloody Valentine and Soul Asylum as key formative experiences and stated &quot;…I liked the performance of the American bands a lot, [...] that all just inspired me, and I put it in a melting pot and out came &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot;.” Drummer Robin Goodridge told the publication &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; in 1996 that &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot; features percussion informed by the styles John Bonham of Led Zeppelin, Billy Cobham and Keith Moon of The Who.

=== Lyrics ===
The lyrical content of &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot; revolved around a variety of themes. &quot;Testosterone&quot; conveyed a take-down of machismo, while &quot;Stereogum&quot; analyzed &quot;Monkey&quot; to be a &quot;sardonic statement about rock stardom&quot; and to &quot;attack the British sellout angle&quot;. &quot;Bomb&quot; is an anti-war song; Rossdale told &quot;American Songwriter&quot; in 2011 that the song had been &quot;written about the Irish IRA presence where I grew up&quot;, further explaining to &quot;Us Weekly&quot; in September 2023 that the song &quot;is about growing up in the shadow of the IRA and the Protestants, the Orange Parade march, and things. Where I grew up in North London, there were these bombed shopping centres and buses, and people died, and it was the real thing.&quot; Other songs related to personal challenges, including &quot;Little Things&quot; which Rossdale claimed was written about &quot;trying to be strong in the face of adversity&quot;.

==Reception==
=== Critical reception ===

&quot;Sixteen Stone&quot; received mostly positive feedback from music critics. &quot;Q&quot; wrote that Bush &quot;make a carefully honed post-grunge sound that fits perfectly alongside American counterparts like Stone Temple Pilots or Live.&quot; In a four-and-a-half stars out of five review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic calls their sound impressive, but states that the band sounds too much like Seattle rockers Nirvana and Pearl Jam. Robert Christgau was more critical in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, regarding it as a &quot;not altogether unmusical howl of male pain&quot; that glorified &quot;despair&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
In April 2014, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the album at number thirty-nine on their &quot;1994: The 40 Best Records From Mainstream Alternative&#x27;s Greatest Year&quot; list. A month later, &quot;Loudwire&quot; placed &quot;Sixteen Stone&quot; at number eight on its &quot;10 Best Hard Rock Albums of 1994&quot; list. In July 2014 &quot;Guitar World&quot; placed the album on its &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot; list.

== Remaster ==
Around the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, a remastered edition of its original recordings was released. When asked about also remixing the album for the anniversary edition, Rossdale stated &quot;I did attempt to remix ... but it&#x27;s really, like, you just can&#x27;t do that. You can&#x27;t mess with stuff. Those mixes, every single level of those songs is just ingrained in my DNA as it&#x27;s probably in anybody&#x27;s DNA who knows it. It just sounds really weird when you mess with it.&quot;

==Track listing==

Notes
*Early pressings of the album do not list &quot;Alien&quot; on the back cover (there is a blank space where the title should be). &quot;Monkey&quot; is also missing from the inside cover, but both songs have lyrics printed and appear on the album.
*Subsequent pressings also include an acoustic version of &quot;Comedown&quot; and a second CD of live tracks, &quot;Swim&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Bomb&quot;, and &quot;Little Things&quot;. Rather than actually being acoustic, the bonus &quot;Comedown&quot; track is actually Rossdale singing and playing guitar with more effects. This version is also slower-paced, has violins added and has no drums.

<text>The Canal through Zuid-Beveland (Dutch: &quot;Kanaal door Zuid-Beveland&quot;) in the southwest Netherlands is the westernmost of two canals crossing the Zuid-Beveland peninsula. It connects the Western Scheldt near Hansweert (to the south of the canal) via a lock complex and the Eastern Scheldt (to the north) with which it has an open connection.

The canal is crossed by the Postbrug (which carries ), a railroad bridge (which carries the Roosendaal–Vlissingen railway), and the (which carries the A58 motorway). In addition, there are two small road bridges built on rollers (one over the southern end of the western lock chamber, and one over the northern end of the eastern lock chamber) which are used by pedestrians, cyclists and horseman.

<doc id="206845" wikidata="Q610502" url="?curid=206845" title="Antz">
<text>Antz is a 1998 American animated adventure comedy film produced by DreamWorks Pictures, DreamWorks Animation, and Pacific Data Images, and distributed by the former via DreamWorks Distribution. It was directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson from a screenplay written by Todd Alcott and the writing team of Chris and Paul Weitz. The film stars the voices of Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Jennifer Lopez, Sylvester Stallone, Christopher Walken, Dan Aykroyd, Anne Bancroft, Danny Glover and Gene Hackman. Some of the main characters share facial similarities with the actors who voice them. The film involves an anxious worker ant, Z (Allen), who falls in love with Princess Bala (Stone). When the arrogant General Mandible (Hackman) attempts to seize control of the ant colony, Z must combine his desire for purpose with his inner strength to save everyone.

Development began in 1988 when Walt Disney Feature Animation pitched a film called &quot;Army Ants&quot;, about a pacifist worker ant teaching lessons of independent thinking to his militaristic colony. Meanwhile, Jeffrey Katzenberg had left the company in a feud with CEO Michael Eisner over the vacant president position after the death of Frank Wells. Katzenberg would later go on to help co-found DreamWorks with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen, and the three planned to rival Disney with the company&#x27;s new animation division. Production began in May 1996, after production had already commenced on &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; (1998). DreamWorks had contracted Pacific Data Images (PDI) in Palo Alto, California, to begin working on computer-animated films to rival Pixar&#x27;s features. Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell composed the music for the film, marking their first animated film. During its production, a controversial public feud erupted between Katzenberg of DreamWorks and Steve Jobs and John Lasseter of Pixar, due to the production of their similar film &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, which was released a month later. The feud worsened when Disney refused to avoid competition with DreamWorks&#x27; intended first animated release, &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;.

&quot;Antz&quot; premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 19, 1998, and was released theatrically in the United States on October 2, 1998. It grossed $171.8 million worldwide on a budget of $42–105 million and received positive reviews, with critics praising the voice cast, animation, humor, and its appeal towards adults.

==Plot==

Z is an anxious worker ant who is suffering an existential crisis because everyone in the colony, including his psychiatrist, reminds him of his insignificance. While at the local bar one night, Z falls in love with the colony&#x27;s princess Bala when she visits the bar to escape her suffocating royal life. Meanwhile, the ant colony declares war on an encroaching termite colony, and soldiers are sent to engage the invaders. To see Bala again, Z exchanges places with his best friend, a soldier ant named Weaver, and joins the army, where he befriends staff sergeant Barbatus. The ants are unaware that General Mandible, the army&#x27;s leader and Bala&#x27;s fiancé, is secretly sending the soldiers loyal to the colony&#x27;s Queen to die so he can stage a coup d&#x27;état. In the battle, everyone except Z is killed by much-larger acid-shooting termite defenders. Before dying, Barbatus tells Z to think for himself instead of blindly following orders. Meanwhile, Weaver joins the digging crew and falls in love with Z&#x27;s co-worker, Azteca.

Z returns home and is mistakenly hailed as a war hero. Secretly dissatisfied, Mandible congratulates him and introduces him to the Queen. There, Z meets Bala, who recognizes him as a worker. Z panics and pretends to take Bala hostage; he flees with Bala, but they end up falling out of the anthill via a garbage chute. Now a fugitive, Z decides to search for Insectopia, a legendary insect paradise. Bala attempts to return to the colony, but quickly rejoins Z after encountering a praying mantis.

Z&#x27;s act of individuality inspires the workers and some soldier ants, halting productivity. To gain control, Mandible publicly portrays Z as a self-centered war criminal, promotes the glory of conformity, and promises the workers rewards for completing a &quot;Mega Tunnel&quot; he designed. However, Mandible&#x27;s second-in-command, a flying ant named Cutter, begins to doubt Mandible&#x27;s constant reassurances that he is acting for the good of the colony.

Z and Bala come upon a human picnic, which they mistake for Insectopia. They are baffled by the wrappings on the food, but Muffy and Chip, a married couple of liberal wasps, condescendingly befriend them and try to help break the wrappers. They are disrupted by a human, who kill Muffy with a fly swatter and attempt to squish the ants with a shoe. Z rescues Bala from the sneaker, and the two ants at last find Insectopia, a trash can overfilled with decaying food.

Meanwhile, after interrogating Weaver, Mandible learns that Z is looking for Insectopia and sends Cutter to find it. That night, while Z is away, Cutter arrives at Insectopia and forcibly flies Bala back to the colony, where Mandible reveals his intention to restart the colony with Bala as his Queen. Seeing Z&#x27;s desperation at finding Bala gone, a drunken Chip, mourning over Muffy&#x27;s death, flies Z back to the colony. When Z arrives, Mandible&#x27;s soldiers forcibly direct him toward the Mega Tunnel. Along the way, he finds Bala held captive in Mandible&#x27;s office. After he frees her, they both discover that Mandible&#x27;s Mega Tunnel leads straight to the puddle next to Insectopia, which Mandible will use to drown the Queen and the workers at the opening ceremony. Bala warns the Queen while Z attempts to stop the workers in time, but fails. Z and Bala unify the Queen and workers into building a ladder towards the surface as the water rises.

Meanwhile, Mandible gathers the soldiers on the surface and gloats he has created a new colony, where only the strong survive. When the worker ants break through the surface, Cutter betrays Mandible and rescues them. Enraged, Mandible attempts to tackle Cutter, but Z intervenes and takes the blow. He and Mandible fall back into the flooded tunnel, with Mandible striking a root and dying on impact. Z nearly drowns, but is rescued by Cutter and resuscitated by Bala. Z is praised for his heroism, and he and Bala become a couple. Together, they rebuild the colony, and Z narrates that he is finally content with his place in the world. The camera then zooms out to show the anthill is in Central Park in New York City.

== Production ==

=== Development and writing ===
In 1988, Walt Disney Feature Animation pitched a film called &quot;Army Ants&quot;, about a pacifist worker ant teaching lessons of independent thinking to his militaristic colony. Years later, Jeffrey Katzenberg, then chairman of Disney&#x27;s film division, had left the company in a feud with CEO Michael Eisner over the vacant president position after the death of Frank Wells. Katzenberg would later go on to help co-found DreamWorks with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen, and the three planned to rival Disney with the company&#x27;s new animation division. Katzenberg at DreamWorks began developing projects he tried to pursue or suggested while at Disney, including &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;, a collaboration with Aardman Animations which resulted in &quot;Chicken Run&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Army Ants&quot;. Also many ideas for the film were borrowed from a scrapped PDI film pitch for a computer-animated film from 1991 called &quot;Bugs: Lights Out&quot; about microscopic robots that take apart machinery.

Production began in May 1996, after production had already commenced on &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;. DreamWorks had contracted Pacific Data Images (PDI) in Palo Alto, California to begin working on computer-animated films to rival Pixar&#x27;s features. Woody Allen was cast in the lead role of Z, and much of Allen&#x27;s trademark humor is present within the film. Allen made some uncredited rewrites to the script, to make the dialogue better fit his style of comedic timing. Sarah Jessica Parker was originally cast as Princess Bala and even recorded some lines, until she was fired, she was replaced by Sharon Stone. An altered line from one of his early directed films, &quot;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)&quot; was included – &quot;I was going to include you in my most erotic fantasies...&quot;

=== Feud between DreamWorks and Pixar ===
During the production of &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, a public feud erupted between DreamWorks&#x27; Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Pixar&#x27;s Steve Jobs and John Lasseter. Katzenberg, former chairman of Disney&#x27;s film division, had left Disney in a feud with CEO Michael Eisner. In response, he formed DreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen and planned to rival Disney in animation. After DreamWorks&#x27; acquisition of Pacific Data Images (PDI)—long Pixar&#x27;s contemporary in computer animation—Lasseter and others at Pixar were dismayed to learn from the trade papers that PDI&#x27;s first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film, to be called &quot;Antz&quot;. By this time, Pixar&#x27;s project was well known within the animation community. Both &quot;Antz&quot; and &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; center on a young male ant, a drone with oddball tendencies that struggles to win a princess&#x27;s hand by saving their society. Whereas &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; relied chiefly on visual gags, &quot;Antz&quot; was more verbal and revolved more around satire. The script of &quot;Antz&quot; was also heavy with adult references, whereas Pixar&#x27;s film was more accessible to children.

Lasseter and Jobs believed that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg. Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split, often calling to check up. In October 1995, when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on &quot;Toy Story&quot; at the Universal Studios Lot&#x27;s Technicolor facility in Universal City, where DreamWorks was also located, he called Katzenberg and dropped by with Stanton. When Katzenberg asked what they were doing next, Lasseter described what would become &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; in detail. Lasseter respected Katzenberg&#x27;s judgment and felt comfortable using him as a sounding board for creative ideas. Lasseter had high hopes for &quot;Toy Story&quot;, and he was telling friends throughout the tight-knit computer-animation business to get cracking on their own films. He told various friends, &quot;If this hits, it&#x27;s going to be like space movies after &quot;Star Wars&quot;&quot; for computer animation companies. Lasseter later recalled, &quot;I should have been wary. Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it would be released.&quot;

When the trades indicated production on &quot;Antz&quot;, Lasseter, feeling betrayed, called Katzenberg and asked him if it was true, who in turn asked him where he had heard the rumor. Lasseter asked again, and Katzenberg admitted it was true. Lasseter raised his voice and would not believe Katzenberg&#x27;s story that a development director had pitched him the idea long ago. Katzenberg claimed &quot;Antz&quot; came from a 1991 story pitch by Tim Johnson that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994. Another source gives Nina Jacobson, one of Katzenberg&#x27;s executives, as the person responsible for the &quot;Antz&quot; pitch. Lasseter, who normally did not use profane language, cursed at Katzenberg and hung up the phone. Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was &quot;out to get him&quot; and Lasseter felt that he was cannon fodder in Katzenberg&#x27;s fight with Disney. For his part, Katzenberg believed he was the victim of a conspiracy: Eisner had decided not to pay him his contract-required bonus, convincing Disney&#x27;s board not to give him anything. Katzenberg was further angered by the fact that Eisner scheduled &quot;Bugs&quot; to open the same week as &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;, which was then intended to be DreamWorks&#x27; first animated release. Lasseter relayed the news to Pixar employees but kept morale high. Privately, Lasseter told other Pixar executives that he and Stanton felt let down by Katzenberg.

Katzenberg moved the opening of &quot;Antz&quot; from spring 1999 to October 1998 to compete with Pixar&#x27;s release. David Price writes in his 2008 book &quot;The Pixar Touch&quot; that a rumor, &quot;never confirmed&quot;, was that Katzenberg had given PDI &quot;rich financial incentives to induce them to whatever it would take to have &quot;Antz&quot; ready first, despite Pixar&#x27;s head start&quot;. Jobs was furious and called Katzenberg and began yelling. Katzenberg made an offer: He would delay production of &quot;Antz&quot; if Jobs and Disney would move &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; so that it did not compete with &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;. Jobs believed it &quot;a blatant extortion attempt&quot; and would not go for it, explaining that there was nothing he could do to convince Disney to change the date. Katzenberg responded that Jobs had taught him how to conduct similar business long ago, explaining that Jobs had come to Pixar&#x27;s rescue by making the deal for &quot;Toy Story&quot;, as Pixar was near bankruptcy at that time. Katzenberg said, &quot;I was the one guy there for you back then, and now you&#x27;re allowing them to use you to screw me.&quot; He suggested that if Jobs wanted to, he could slow down production on &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; without telling Disney. If he did, Katzenberg said, he would put &quot;Antz&quot; on hold. Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with the proposition, but Katzenberg denied these charges later.

As the release dates for both films approached, Disney executives concluded that Pixar should keep silent on the DreamWorks battle. Regardless, Lasseter publicly dismissed &quot;Antz&quot; as a &quot;schlock version&quot; of &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;. Lasseter, who claimed to have never seen &quot;Antz&quot;, told others that if DreamWorks and PDI had made the film about anything other than insects, he would have closed Pixar for the day so the entire company could go see it. Jobs and Katzenberg would not back down and the rivaling ant films provoked a press frenzy. &quot;The bad guys rarely win,&quot; Jobs told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. In response, DreamWorks&#x27; head of marketing Terry Press stated, &quot;Steve Jobs should take a pill.&quot; Despite the successful box office performances of both films, tensions would remain high between Jobs and Katzenberg for many years. According to Jobs, Katzenberg came to Jobs after the success of &quot;Shrek&quot; (2001) and insisted he had never heard the pitch for &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, reasoning that his settlement with Disney would have given him a share of the profits if that were so. Although the contention left all parties estranged, Pixar and PDI employees kept up the old friendships that had arisen from spending a long time together in computer animation.

=== Competition with Disney ===
At the time, the current Disney studio executives were starting a bitter competitive rivalry with Jeffrey Katzenberg and his new DreamWorks films. In 1995, Katzenberg announced &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; to debut in November 1998 as DreamWorks&#x27; first animated release. A year later, Disney scheduled &quot;Bugs&quot; to open on the same weekend, which infuriated Katzenberg. Katzenberg invited Disney executives to DreamWorks to negotiate a release date change for &quot;Bugs&quot;, but the company refused to budge. DreamWorks pushed &quot;Prince of Egypt&quot; to the Christmas season and the studio had decided not to begin full marketing for &quot;Antz&quot; until after &quot;Prince of Egypt&quot; was released. Disney afterward announced release dates for films that were going to compete with &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;, and both studios had to compete with Paramount Pictures, which was releasing &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot; in November, based on Nickelodeon&#x27;s animated series &quot;Rugrats&quot;. Katzenberg suddenly moved the opening of &quot;Antz&quot; from March 1999 to October 1998, in order to successfully beat &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; into cinemas.

David Price writes in his 2008 book &quot;The Pixar Touch&quot; that a rumor, &quot;never confirmed&quot;, was that Katzenberg had given PDI &quot;rich financial incentives to induce them to whatever it would take to have &quot;Antz&quot; ready first, despite Pixar&#x27;s head start&quot;. Jobs furiously called Katzenberg to explain that there was nothing he could do to convince Disney to change the date. Katzenberg said to him that Jobs himself had taught him how to conduct similar business long ago, explaining that Jobs had come to Pixar&#x27;s rescue from near bankruptcy by making the deal for &quot;Toy Story&quot; with Disney. He told Jobs that he had enough power with Disney to convince them to change specific plans on their films. Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with a final proposition to delay &quot;Antz&quot; if Disney and Pixar changed the date of &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, but Katzenberg denied this. Jobs believed it was &quot;a blatant extortion attempt&quot;.

=== Release fallout and comparisons ===
As the release dates for both films approached, Disney executives concluded that Pixar should keep quiet on &quot;Antz&quot; and the feud concerning DreamWorks. Regardless, Lasseter publicly dismissed &quot;Antz&quot; as a &quot;schlock version&quot; of &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;; however, Lasseter later admitted that he never saw the film. Lasseter claimed that if DreamWorks and PDI had made the film about anything other than insects, he would have closed Pixar for the day so the entire company could go see it. Jobs and Katzenberg would not back down and the rivaling ant films provoked a press frenzy. &quot;The bad guys rarely win,&quot; Jobs told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. In response, DreamWorks&#x27; head of marketing Terry Press suggested, &quot;Steve Jobs should take a pill.&quot; Tensions would remain high between Jobs and Katzenberg for many years after the release of both films. According to Jobs, years later, Katzenberg approached him after the opening of &quot;Shrek&quot;, and insisted that he had never heard the pitch for &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, reasoning that his settlement with Disney would have given him a share of the profits if that were so. In the end, Pixar and PDI employees kept up the old friendships that had arisen from working in computer animation for years before feature films.

The final product of both films are generally perceived to contrast one another in tone and certain plot points. &quot;Antz&quot; in the end seemed to be more geared towards older audiences, featuring moderate violence, mild sexual innuendoes, and profanity, as well as social and political satire. &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; was more family-friendly and lighthearted in tone and story. The two films especially differ in their artistic look: &quot;Antz&quot; played off more realistic aspects of ants and how they relate to other bugs, like termites and wasps, while &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; offered a more fanciful look at insects to better suit its story. &quot;PopMatters&quot; journalist J.C. Maçek III compared the two films and wrote, &quot;The feud deepened with both teams making accusations and excuses and a release date war ensued. While &quot;Antz&quot; beat &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; to the big screen by two months, the latter film significantly out grossed its predecessor. Rip off or not, &quot;Antz&quot;&#x27;s critical response has proven to be almost exactly as positive as what &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; has enjoyed.&quot;

== Music ==

The original music for the film was composed by Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell. The soundtrack was released on November 3, 1998 by Angel Records.

Initially, Jeffrey Katzenberg wanted Hans Zimmer to compose the music, but he was too busy with &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; among other projects. Instead, Zimmer suggested two composers from his studio — either Harry Gregson-Williams or John Powell — both of whom had already collaborated on &quot;Egypt&quot;.

== Release ==
=== Theatrical ===
On December 23, 1997, a teaser trailer for &quot;Antz&quot;, depicting the opening scene with Z in an ant psychiatrist office, first played in theaters in front of select prints of &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot;. Anticipation was generally high with adults rather than families and children. &quot;Antz&quot; premiered at the 1998 Toronto International Film Festival on September 19, 1998, and entered wide release on October 2, 1998.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Antz&quot; was released on VHS and DIVX on February 9, 1999, and on DVD on March 23, becoming the first feature-length CGI-animated film to be available on DVD. The original release used a 35mm print of the film, rather than an encoded version from the original files. A special edition version was released on February 14, 2003. The film was released on Blu-ray on October 16, 2018 for the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
The film topped the box office in its opening weekend ahead of &quot;Rush Hour&quot; and &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot;, earning $17,195,160 for a $7,021 average from 2,449 theatres. It surpassed &quot;Stargate&quot; to have the highest October opening weekend. This record would last for two years until it was beaten by &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; in 2000. In its second weekend, the film held the top spot again, with a slippage of only 14% to $14.7 million for a $5,230 average and expanding to 2,813 sites. It held well also in its third weekend, slipping only 24% to $11.2 million and finishing in third place, for a $3,863 average from 2,903 theatres. The film&#x27;s widest release was 2,929 theatres, and closed on February 18, 1999. The film altogether picked up $90,757,863 domestically, but failed to outgross the competition with &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;. The film picked up an additional $81 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $171.8 million.

According to DreamWorks, the film&#x27;s budget was about $42 million, while the numbers $60 million and $105 million were also reported. According to &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the first figure was doubted by the film industry, considering that other computer-animated films at the time cost twice that amount, and that the budget did not include start-up costs of PDI.

=== Critical response ===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 92% based on 91 reviews and an average rating of 7.60/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Featuring a stellar voice cast, technically dazzling animation, and loads of good humor, &quot;Antz&quot; should delight both children and adults.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 73 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert praised the film, saying that it is &quot;sharp and funny&quot;. The variety of themes, interesting visuals, and voice acting were each aspects of the film that were praised. Ebert&#x27;s partner, Gene Siskel, greatly enjoyed the film and preferred it over &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;. Siskel later ranked it No. 7 on his picks of the Best Films of 1998.

=== Accolades ===

=== Video games ===
=== Cancelled sequel ===
A direct-to-video sequel was in development at DreamWorks at the time of the release of &quot;Antz&quot;. Like the first film, it was planned to be produced by Pacific Data Images, and was also considered for theatrical release. By early 1999, when DreamWorks closed its television animation unit and merged the direct-to-video unit with the feature animation, the sequel was still planned, but eventually the project was cancelled.

<doc id="206846" wikidata="Q3492484" url="?curid=206846" title="Nick Beggs">
<text>Nicholas Beggs (born 15 December 1961) is an English musician, noted for playing the bass guitar and the Chapman Stick; he is a member of the Mute Gods and Kajagoogoo, formerly also a part of Iona and Ellis, Beggs &amp; Howard and plays in the band of Steven Wilson. He is known for modifying a Chapman Stick into a fully MIDI-capable instrument triggering MIDI from both bass and melody strings; he calls it the Virtual Stick.

==Career==
Beggs&#x27; first band Johnny and the Martians (formed when he was 10) consisted of two friends on trumpet and acoustic guitar and Beggs on drums. He went to Linslade Secondary School. 
After attending art school, in 1978 Beggs formed the band Art Nouveau with Steve Askew, Stuart Croxford Neale and Jez Strode. Chris Hamill (Limahl) joined the band in 1981 and at Beggs&#x27; suggestion it was renamed Kajagoogoo. The release of the first single &quot;Too Shy&quot; in January 1983 saw the band on a promotional tour as the record reached number 1 in the UK Singles Chart. The band went on to have four more UK top 40 hits through 1983 and 1984.

After firing lead singer Limahl in 1983 and, following a split with Strode in 1985, the three remaining band members reformed as Kaja, releasing the album &quot;Crazy Peoples Right to Speak&quot; and the single &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t Do That&quot;.

Between 1985 and 1987, Beggs concentrated on writing with various other songwriters and formed Ellis, Beggs &amp; Howard in March 1987. Ellis, Beggs and Howard split in 1989, and in 1990 Beggs joined the progressive folk band Iona. He recorded two albums with them: &quot;The Book of Kells&quot; and &quot;Beyond These Shores&quot;.

He continued working with various artists and bands, including Gary Numan, Alphaville, Belinda Carlisle, Emma Bunton (on her album &quot;Life in Mono&quot;) and Led Zeppelin&#x27;s former bass player, John Paul Jones. In 1996, Beggs met Howard Jones on a flight from the United States, and Jones invited Beggs to tour as part of his band.

Beggs worked as a manager for Phonogram Records for eight months. He later became a contributor to various guitar publications, and he is a staff writer for &quot;Bass Guitar&quot; magazine. He is also a patron of London-based guitar and bass school Guitar-X.

He has recorded and released &quot;Stick Insect&quot; (2002), &quot;The Maverick Helmsman&quot; (2004), and &quot;The Darkness Inside Mens Hearts&quot;.

Beggs and Askew have been heavily involved with a duo named Industrial Salt, which have been successful in Japan. They have written material for Claudia Mills, a finalist on the talent show &quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot;.

A reformed Kajagoogoo with Beggs, Askew and Croxford Neale toured in 2004. Limahl and Strode both rejoined in 2008, and the band toured extensively. The band released an EP of new material in 2011. In an interview with Cherry Red TV in 2018, Beggs talked about the reunion, stating &quot;we reformed and we toured and we recorded an EP and remastered the back catalogue...and at that point I felt that we had done it all. It was a nice way to tie it up, put a bow on it and leave it alone and move on.&quot;

Since 2011, Beggs is a member of Steven Wilson&#x27;s touring band, having also played on Wilson&#x27;s albums &quot;Grace For Drowning&quot;, &quot;The Raven That Refused to Sing&quot;, &quot;Hand. Cannot. Erase.&quot;, the EP &quot;41/2&quot;, &quot;To the Bone&quot;, &quot;The Future Bites&quot; and &quot;The Harmony Codex&quot;.

In February 2013, Beggs&#x27;s project Lifesigns, with John Young and Frosty Beedle, released a self-titled album.

Beggs also became a member of the Belgian prog band Fish on Friday, starting the collaboration with their third album named Godspeed at the end of 2014, marking the starting point of a series of successful albums, along a decade: Quiet Life (2017), Black Rain (2020), and the most recent creation, 8mm (2023).

He contributed to John Mitchell&#x27;s solo project Lonely Robot, which released the album &quot;Please Come Home&quot; in February 2015.

Beggs&#x27;s latest collaboration is named The Mute Gods, with Marco Minneman and Roger King. Their first album was released in January 2016, titled &quot;Do Nothing till You Hear from Me&quot;. This was followed up with &quot;Tardigrades Will Inherit The Earth&quot; in February 2017 and Atheists and Believers in 2019.
In 2024, Beggs will temporarily replace bass player Peter Trewavas of Marillion, who is unavailable after a medical procedure. 

==Personal life==
Beggs was a pescetarian for a while. He has been a vegetarian as of January 2016, due to his rejection of the livestock industry.
