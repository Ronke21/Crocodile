<text>The water cycle (or hydrologic cycle or hydrological cycle) is a biogeochemical cycle that involves the continuous movement of water on, above and below the surface of the Earth. The mass of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time. However, the partitioning of the water into the major reservoirs of ice, fresh water, salt water and atmospheric water is variable and depends on climatic variables. The water moves from one reservoir to another, such as from river to ocean, or from the ocean to the atmosphere. The processes that drive these movements are evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, sublimation, infiltration, surface runoff, and subsurface flow. In doing so, the water goes through different forms: liquid, solid (ice) and vapor. The ocean plays a key role in the water cycle as it is the source of 86% of global evaporation.

The water cycle involves the exchange of energy, which leads to temperature changes. When water evaporates, it takes up energy from its surroundings and cools the environment. When it condenses, it releases energy and warms the environment. These heat exchanges influence the climate system.

The evaporative phase of the cycle purifies water because it causes salts and other solids picked up during the cycle to be left behind. The condensation phase in the atmosphere replenishes the land with freshwater. The flow of liquid water and ice transports minerals across the globe. It also reshapes the geological features of the Earth, through processes including erosion and sedimentation. The water cycle is also essential for the maintenance of most life and ecosystems on the planet.

Human actions are greatly affecting the water cycle. Activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and the extraction of groundwater are altering natural landscapes (land use changes) all have an effect on the water cycle. On top of this, climate change is leading to an intensification of the water cycle. Research has shown that global warming is causing shifts in precipitation patterns, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and changes in the timing and intensity of rainfall. These water cycle changes affect ecosystems, water availability, agriculture, and human societies.

== Description ==

=== Overall process ===

The water cycle is powered from the energy emitted by the sun. This energy heats water in the ocean and seas. Water evaporates as water vapor into the air. Some ice and snow sublimates directly into water vapor. Evapotranspiration is water transpired from plants and evaporated from the soil. The water molecule has smaller molecular mass than the major components of the atmosphere, nitrogen () and oxygen () and hence is less dense. Due to the significant difference in density, buoyancy drives humid air higher. As altitude increases, air pressure decreases and the temperature drops (see Gas laws). The lower temperature causes water vapor to condense into tiny liquid water droplets which are heavier than the air, and which fall unless supported by an updraft. A huge concentration of these droplets over a large area in the atmosphere becomes visible as cloud, while condensation near ground level is referred to as fog.

Atmospheric circulation moves water vapor around the globe; cloud particles collide, grow, and fall out of the upper atmospheric layers as precipitation. Some precipitation falls as snow, hail, or sleet, and can accumulate in ice caps and glaciers, which can store frozen water for thousands of years. Most water falls as rain back into the ocean or onto land, where the water flows over the ground as surface runoff. A portion of this runoff enters rivers, with streamflow moving water towards the oceans. Runoff and water emerging from the ground (groundwater) may be stored as freshwater in lakes. Not all runoff flows into rivers; much of it soaks into the ground as infiltration. Some water infiltrates deep into the ground and replenishes aquifers, which can store freshwater for long periods of time. Some infiltration stays close to the land surface and can seep back into surface-water bodies (and the ocean) as groundwater discharge or be taken up by plants and transferred back to the atmosphere as water vapor by transpiration. Some groundwater finds openings in the land surface and emerges as freshwater springs. In river valleys and floodplains, there is often continuous water exchange between surface water and ground water in the hyporheic zone. Over time, the water returns to the ocean, to continue the water cycle.

The ocean plays a key role in the water cycle. The ocean holds &quot;97% of the total water on the planet; 78% of global precipitation occurs over the ocean, and it is the source of 86% of global evaporation&quot;.
Important physical processes within the water cycle include (in alphabetical order):
* Advection: The movement of water through the atmosphere. Without advection, water that evaporated over the oceans could not precipitate over land. Atmospheric rivers that move large volumes of water vapor over long distances are an example of advection.
* Condensation: The transformation of water vapor to liquid water droplets in the air, creating clouds and fog.
* Evaporation: The transformation of water from liquid to gas phases as it moves from the ground or bodies of water into the overlying atmosphere. The source of energy for evaporation is primarily solar radiation. Evaporation often implicitly includes transpiration from plants, though together they are specifically referred to as evapotranspiration. Total annual evapotranspiration amounts to approximately of water, of which evaporates from the oceans. 86% of global evaporation occurs over the ocean.
* Infiltration: The flow of water from the ground surface into the ground. Once infiltrated, the water becomes soil moisture or groundwater. A recent global study using water stable isotopes, however, shows that not all soil moisture is equally available for groundwater recharge or for plant transpiration.
* Percolation: Water flows vertically through the soil and rocks under the influence of gravity.
* Precipitation: Condensed water vapor that falls to the Earth&#x27;s surface. Most precipitation occurs as rain, but also includes snow, hail, fog drip, graupel, and sleet. Approximately of water falls as precipitation each year, of it over the oceans. The rain on land contains of water per year and a snowing only . 78% of global precipitation occurs over the ocean.
* Runoff: The variety of ways by which water moves across the land. This includes both surface runoff and channel runoff. As it flows, the water may seep into the ground, evaporate into the air, become stored in lakes or reservoirs, or be extracted for agricultural or other human uses.
* Subsurface flow: The flow of water underground, in the vadose zone and aquifers. Subsurface water may return to the surface (e.g. as a spring or by being pumped) or eventually seep into the oceans. Water returns to the land surface at lower elevation than where it infiltrated, under the force of gravity or gravity induced pressures. Groundwater tends to move slowly and is replenished slowly, so it can remain in aquifers for thousands of years.
* Transpiration: The release of water vapor from plants and soil into the air.

=== Residence times ===
The &quot;residence time&quot; of a reservoir within the hydrologic cycle is the average time a water molecule will spend in that reservoir (&quot;see table&quot;). It is a measure of the average age of the water in that reservoir.

Groundwater can spend over 10,000 years beneath Earth&#x27;s surface before leaving. Particularly old groundwater is called fossil water. Water stored in the soil remains there very briefly, because it is spread thinly across the Earth, and is readily lost by evaporation, transpiration, stream flow, or groundwater recharge. After evaporating, the residence time in the atmosphere is about 9 days before condensing and falling to the Earth as precipitation.

The major ice sheets – Antarctica and Greenland – store ice for very long periods. Ice from Antarctica has been reliably dated to 800,000 years before present, though the average residence time is shorter.

In hydrology, residence times can be estimated in two ways. The more common method relies on the principle of conservation of mass (water balance) and assumes the amount of water in a given reservoir is roughly constant. With this method, residence times are estimated by dividing the volume of the reservoir by the rate by which water either enters or exits the reservoir. Conceptually, this is equivalent to timing how long it would take the reservoir to become filled from empty if no water were to leave (or how long it would take the reservoir to empty from full if no water were to enter).

An alternative method to estimate residence times, which is gaining in popularity for dating groundwater, is the use of isotopic techniques. This is done in the subfield of isotope hydrology.

=== Water in storage ===
The water cycle describes the processes that drive the movement of water throughout the hydrosphere. However, much more water is &quot;in storage&quot; (or in &quot;pools&quot;) for long periods of time than is actually moving through the cycle. The storehouses for the vast majority of all water on Earth are the oceans. It is estimated that of the 1,386,000,000 km3 of the world&#x27;s water supply, about 1,338,000,000 km3 is stored in oceans, or about 97%. It is also estimated that the oceans supply about 90% of the evaporated water that goes into the water cycle. The Earth&#x27;s ice caps, glaciers, and permanent snowpack stores another 24,064,000 km3 accounting for only 1.7% of the planet&#x27;s total water volume. However, this quantity of water is 68.7% of all freshwater on the planet.

==Changes caused by humans==

=== Local or regional impacts ===

Human activities can alter the water cycle at the local or regional level. This happens due to changes in land use and land cover. Such changes affect &quot;precipitation, evaporation, flooding, groundwater, and the availability of freshwater for a variety of uses&quot;.

Examples for such land use changes are converting fields to urban areas or clearing forests. Such changes can affect the ability of soils to soak up surface water. Deforestation has local as well as regional effects. For example it reduces soil moisture, evaporation and rainfall at the local level. Furthermore, deforestation causes regional temperature changes that can affect rainfall patterns. 

Aquifer drawdown or overdrafting and the pumping of fossil water increase the total amount of water in the hydrosphere. This is because the water that was originally in the ground has now become available for evaporation as it is now in contact with the atmosphere.

=== Water cycle intensification due to climate change ===

Since the middle of the 20th century, human-caused climate change has resulted in observable changes in the global water cycle. The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report in 2021 predicted that these changes will continue to grow significantly at the global and regional level. These findings are a continuation of scientific consensus expressed in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report from 2007 and other special reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which had already stated that the water cycle will continue to intensify throughout the 21st century.

=== Biogeochemical cycling ===
While the water cycle is itself a biogeochemical cycle, flow of water over and beneath the Earth is a key component of the cycling of other biogeochemicals. Runoff is responsible for almost all of the transport of eroded sediment and phosphorus from land to waterbodies. The salinity of the oceans is derived from erosion and transport of dissolved salts from the land. Cultural eutrophication of lakes is primarily due to phosphorus, applied in excess to agricultural fields in fertilizers, and then transported overland and down rivers. Both runoff and groundwater flow play significant roles in transporting nitrogen from the land to waterbodies. The dead zone at the outlet of the Mississippi River is a consequence of nitrates from fertilizer being carried off agricultural fields and funnelled down the river system to the Gulf of Mexico. Runoff also plays a part in the carbon cycle, again through the transport of eroded rock and soil.

=== Slow loss over geologic time ===
The hydrodynamic wind within the upper portion of a planet&#x27;s atmosphere allows light chemical elements such as Hydrogen to move up to the exobase, the lower limit of the exosphere, where the gases can then reach escape velocity, entering outer space without impacting other particles of gas. This type of gas loss from a planet into space is known as planetary wind. Planets with hot lower atmospheres could result in humid upper atmospheres that accelerate the loss of hydrogen.

==Historical interpretations==
In ancient times, it was widely thought that the land mass floated on a body of water, and that most of the water in rivers has its origin under the earth. Examples of this belief can be found in the works of Homer ().

In Works and Days (ca. 700 BC), the Greek poet Hesiod outlines the idea of the water cycle: &quot;[Vapour] is drawn from the ever-flowing rivers and is raised high above the earth by windstorm, and sometimes it turns to rain towards evening, and sometimes to wind when Thracian Boreas huddles the thick clouds.&quot;

In the ancient Near East, Hebrew scholars observed that even though the rivers ran into the sea, the sea never became full. Some scholars conclude that the water cycle was described completely during this time in this passage: &quot;The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to its circuits. All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again&quot; (Ecclesiastes 1:6-7). Furthermore, it was also observed that when the clouds were full, they emptied rain on the earth (Ecclesiastes 11:3). 

In the Adityahridayam (a devotional hymn to the Sun God) of Ramayana, a Hindu epic dated to the 4th century BCE, it is mentioned in the 22nd verse that the Sun heats up water and sends it down as rain. By roughly 500 BCE, Greek scholars were speculating that much of the water in rivers can be attributed to rain. The origin of rain was also known by then. These scholars maintained the belief, however, that water rising up through the earth contributed a great deal to rivers. Examples of this thinking included Anaximander (570 BCE) (who also speculated about the evolution of land animals from fish) and Xenophanes of Colophon (530 BCE). Warring States period Chinese scholars such as Chi Ni Tzu (320 BCE) and Lu Shih Ch&#x27;un Ch&#x27;iu (239 BCE) had similar thoughts.

The idea that the water cycle is a closed cycle can be found in the works of Anaxagoras of Clazomenae (460 BCE) and Diogenes of Apollonia (460 BCE). Both Plato (390 BCE) and Aristotle (350 BCE) speculated about percolation as part of the water cycle. Aristotle correctly hypothesized that the sun played a role in the Earth&#x27;s hydraulic cycle in his book &quot;Meteorology,&quot; writing &quot;By it [the sun&#x27;s] agency the finest and sweetest water is everyday carried up and is dissolved into vapor and rises to the upper regions, where it is condensed again by the cold and so returns to the earth.&quot;, and believed that clouds were composed of cooled and condensed water vapor. Much like the earlier Aristotle, the Eastern Han Chinese scientist Wang Chong (27–100 AD) accurately described the water cycle of Earth in his &quot;Lunheng&quot; but was dismissed by his contemporaries.

Up to the time of the Renaissance, it was wrongly assumed that precipitation alone was insufficient to feed rivers, for a complete water cycle, and that underground water pushing upwards from the oceans were the main contributors to river water. Bartholomew of England held this view (1240 CE), as did Leonardo da Vinci (1500 CE) and Athanasius Kircher (1644 CE).

=== Discovery of the correct theory ===
The first published thinker to assert that rainfall alone was sufficient for the maintenance of rivers was Bernard Palissy (1580 CE), who is often credited as the discoverer of the modern theory of the water cycle. Palissy&#x27;s theories were not tested scientifically until 1674, in a study commonly attributed to Pierre Perrault. Even then, these beliefs were not accepted in mainstream science until the early nineteenth century.

<text>Basra Governorate ( ), also called Basra Province, is a governorate in southern Iraq in the region of Arabian Peninsula, bordering Kuwait to the south and Iran to the east. The capital is the city of Basra, located in the Basrah district. Other districts of Basra include Al-Qurna, Al-Zubair, Al-Midaina, Shatt Al-Arab, Abu Al-Khaseeb and Al-Faw located on the Persian Gulf. It is the only governorate with a coastline.

==History==

In 1920, after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, the United Kingdom took over the former Ottoman vilayets of Basra, Baghdad and Mosul which had together formed the historical region of &quot;Irak Arabi&quot; or &quot;Irak Babeli&quot;, and called it the British Mandate of Mesopotamia. The mandate was succeeded by the Kingdom of Iraq in 1932.

The Shiite population suffered long and hard under Saddam&#x27;s rule. The city of Basra had suffered considerably during the eight-year war with Iran and Allied bombardment and in 1991 during the Gulf War, the governorate ventured into an uprising after the United States promised them aid. It was started in Basra by angry soldiers, according to popular legend after they fired at a giant public portrait of Saddam Hussein. Mass support on the streets followed, shouting slogans, executing Ba&#x27;ath party members, leaders and secret police, and destroying pictures and monuments of Saddam Hussein. The participants had expected support from American troops. but the Allied army at the time was occupied despite the 24th Infantry Division stationed only several miles from the city. The city of Basra did not completely succumb to the rebels; a counterattack by some 6,000 loyalists from the Republican Guard held out against 5,000 defectors of the Iraqi army. After about three days, the Republican Guard began to gain control, destroying &quot;everything in front of them&quot;, killing many of the rebels in the streets and conducting mass executions on the public squares.

From 2003 the governorate was one of the centres of warfare during the invasion of the British and Americans during the Iraq War. The Battle of Basra took place between March 23 and April 7 between the British 1st Armoured Division forces under Major General Robin Brims, and Iraqi forces under General Ali Hassan al-Majid (Chemical Ali). Much of the heaviest combat in the war took place in the province in subsequent weeks. Several outbreaks of violence between secular Iraqis and Shiite Muslims broke out in summer 2006, and in September 2007, British troops were withdrawn to Basra Airport, and withdrew entirely from the city in December 2007. Following the example of the Kurdistan Autonomous Region in northern Iraq, Basra has proposed uniting with the other provinces of Dhi Qar and Maysan as an autonomous region. On October 15, 2005, 691,024 people, some 96.02%, voted for the new constitution. 

During the Gulf War, part of Kuwait became a part of the Basra Governorate and was given the name, Saddamiyat al-Mitla&#x27; District.

<doc id="200176" wikidata="Q1283196" url="?curid=200176" title="Root pressure">
<text>Root pressure is the transverse osmotic pressure within the cells of a root system that causes sap to rise through a plant stem to the leaves.

Root pressure occurs in the xylem of some vascular plants when the soil moisture level is high either at night or when transpiration is low during the daytime. When transpiration is high, xylem sap is usually under tension, rather than under pressure, due to transpirational pull. At night in some plants, root pressure causes guttation or exudation of drops of xylem sap from the tips or edges of leaves. Root pressure is studied by removing the shoot of a plant near the soil level. Xylem sap will exude from the cut stem for hours or days due to root pressure. If a pressure gauge is attached to the cut stem, the root pressure can be measured.

Root pressure is caused by active distribution of mineral nutrient ions into the root xylem. Without transpiration to carry the ions up the stem, they accumulate in the root xylem and lower the water potential. Water then diffuses from the soil into the root xylem due to osmosis. Root pressure is caused by this accumulation of water in the xylem pushing on the rigid cells. Root pressure provides a force, which pushes water up the stem, but it is not enough to account for the movement of water to leaves at the top of the tallest trees. The maximum root pressure measured in some plants can raise water only to 6.87 meters, and the tallest trees are over 100 meters tall.

==Role of endodermis==
The endodermis in the root is important in the development of root pressure. The endodermis is a single layer of cells between the cortex and the pericycle. These cells allow water movement until it reaches the Casparian strip, made of suberin, a waterproof substance. The Casparian strip prevents mineral nutrient ions from moving passively through the endodermal cell walls. Water and ions move in these cell walls via the apoplast pathway. Ions outside the endodermis must be actively transported across an endodermal cell membrane to enter or exit the endodermis. Once inside the endodermis, the ions are in the symplast pathway. They cannot diffuse back out again but can move from cell to cell via plasmodesmata or be actively transported into the xylem. Once in the xylem vessels or tracheids, ions are again in the apoplast pathway. Xylem vessels and tracheids transport water up the plant but lack cell membranes. The Casparian strip substitutes for their lack of cell membranes and prevents accumulated ions from diffusing passively in apoplast pathway out of the endodermis. The ions accumulating interior to the endodermis in the xylem create a water potential gradient and by osmosis, water diffuses from the moist soil, across the cortex, through the endodermis and into the xylem.

Root pressure can transport water and dissolved mineral nutrients from roots through the xylem to the tops of relatively short plants when transpiration is low or zero. The maximum root pressure measured is about 0.6 megapascals but some species never generate any root pressure. The main contributor to the movement of water and mineral nutrients upward in vascular plants is considered to be the transpirational pull. However, sunflower plants grown in 100% relative humidity grew normally and accumulated the same amount of mineral nutrients as plants in normal humidity, which had a transpiration rate 10 to 15 times the plants in 100% humidity. Thus, transpiration may not be as important in upward mineral nutrient transport in relatively short plants as often assumed.

Xylem vessels sometimes empty over winter. Root pressure may be important in refilling the xylem vessels. However, in some species vessels refill without root pressure.

Root pressure is often high in some deciduous trees before they leaf out. Transpiration is minimal without leaves, and organic solutes are being mobilized so decrease the xylem water potential. Sugar maple accumulates high concentrations of sugars in its xylem early in the spring, which is the source of maple sugar. Some trees &quot;bleed&quot; xylem sap profusely when their stems are pruned in late winter or early spring, e.g. maple and elm. Such bleeding is similar to root pressure only sugars, rather than ions, may lower the xylem water potential. In the unique case of maple trees, sap bleeding is caused by changes in stem pressure and not root pressure.

It is very likely that all grasses produce root pressure. In bamboos, root pressure is correlated with maximum height of a clone.

<doc id="200178" wikidata="Q623379" url="?curid=200178" title="Guttation">
<text>Guttation is the exudation of drops of xylem and phloem sap on the tips or edges of leaves of some vascular plants, such as grasses, and also a number of fungi. Ancient Latin gutta means &quot;a drop of fluid&quot;, whence modern botany formed the word guttation to designate that a plant exudes drops of fluid onto the outer surface of the plant, when the source of the fluid is inside the plant. Guttation happens in a variety of plant species.

==Process==

At night, transpiration usually does not occur, because most plants have their stomata closed. When there is a high soil moisture level, water will enter plant roots, because the water potential of the roots is lower than in the soil solution. The water will accumulate in the plant, creating a slight root pressure. The root pressure forces some water to exude through special leaf tip or edge structures, hydathodes or water glands, forming drops. Root pressure provides the impetus for this flow, rather than transpirational pull. Guttation is most noticeable when transpiration is suppressed and the relative humidity is high, such as during the night. 

Guttation formation in fungi is important for visual identification, but the process causing it is unknown. However, due to its association with stages of rapid growth in the life cycle of fungi, it has been hypothesised that during rapid metabolism excess water produced by respiration is exuded.

==Chemical content==
Guttation fluid may contain a variety of organic and inorganic compounds, mainly sugars, and potassium. On drying, a white crust remains on the leaf surface.

Girolami et al. (2009) found that guttation drops from corn plants germinated from neonicotinoid-coated seeds could contain amounts of insecticide consistently higher than 10 mg/L, and up to 200 mg/L for the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. Concentrations this high are near those of active ingredients applied in field sprays for pest control and sometimes even higher. It was found that when bees consume guttation drops collected from plants grown from neonicotinoid-coated seeds, they die within a few minutes.

===Nitrogen levels===
If high levels of nitrogen appear in the fluid, it is a sign of fertilizer burn.

==Nutrition==
Guttation droplets are consumed by numerous insects of different orders, and is an important and highly reliable source of essential carbohydrates and proteins. Unlike nectar, guttation droplets are present in an ecosystem during the entire growing season.

<text>François Tombalbaye ( &#x27;; 15 June 1918 – 13 April 1975), also known asN&#x27;Garta Tombalbaye, was a Chadian politician who served as the first President of Chad from the country&#x27;s independence in 1960 until his overthrow in 1975. A dictatorial leader, his divisive policies as president led to factional conflict and a pattern of authoritarian leadership and political instability that are still relevant in Chad today.

A native of the south of the country and a member of the Sara ethnic group, Tombalbaye began his career as a teacher during French colonial rule and joined the Chadian Progressive Party (PPT) in 1946. After serving in the colonial legislature in the 1950s, he succeeded Gabriel Lisette as the PPT&#x27;s leader in 1959 and was appointed the country&#x27;s first president upon gaining independence in 1960. In 1962, he declared the PPT the sole legal party and presided over a corrupt dictatorship characterized by extreme favoritism to his southern-based patronage network. In addition to his dictatorial rule, he also attempted an Africanization program that worsened the divide between the Muslim north and the Christian and animist south. In 1965, tax riots erupted into a civil war between his government and northern FROLINAT rebels. During the war, his regime was supported by France, while FROLINAT was supported by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.

In 1973, he founded a new party, the National Movement for the Cultural and Social Revolution (MNRCS), changed his name to N&#x27;Garta Tombalbaye and attempted to further Africanize the country through a program of &quot;authenticité&quot;. As the civil war continued and his support in the south dwindled, particularly over his imposition of &quot;yondo&quot;, a form of ritual scarring on members of the civil service and military, he was overthrown and assassinated by members of the Chadian military during the 1975 Chadian coup d&#x27;état and replaced by Félix Malloum.

==Early life==
Tombalbaye was born on 15 June 1918 in the village of Bessada, in the southern region of the French colony of Chad, close to the city of Koumra. His father was a prominent trader and he was of the Sara ethnic group, the prominent ethnicity of Chad&#x27;s five southern prefectures. He attended a primary school, run by Protestant missionaries, in Sarh, and secondary school in Brazzaville. As a young man, Tombalbaye studied to become an educator in the Republic of Congo&#x27;s capital of Brazzaville, due to the lack of in-country schools.

During World War II, Tombalbaye fought for Free France against the Nazi-backed Vichy regime.

==Early political career==

In 1946/7, Tombalbaye formed a chapter of the Chadian Progressive Party (PPT) in Sarh and rallied members of his clan and other Sara speakers to the party. After a Muslim trader mocked the Sara people as mere beasts in November 1947, he helped to direct violent protest in N&#x27;Djamena. In 1949, the French government revoked his teaching position as punishment to his involvement in political activism. A year later, he went on to direct the PPT newspaper, &quot;AEF Nouvelle&quot; but shut down the same year after French repression. In 1952, he won a seat in the colonial territorial assembly and was elected to French Equatorial Africa general council in 1957, where he served as vice-president. Tensions between him and Lisette grew in the late 1950s after the 1956 &quot;loi-cadre&quot; reforms where individual colonies politicians are allowed to negotiate their own constituents, rather than maintain the federation of colonies of French Equatorial Africa. He later succeeded Gabriel Lisette as head of the Chadian Progressive Party (PPT) in March 1959 after coming under pressure, heading Chad&#x27;s colonial government from 1959. He ruled the country during its independence on 11 August 1960, and was appointed its first head of government.

==Presidency==
Tombalbaye managed to create a coalition of progressive forces from both the north and south of the country and isolating the more conservative Islamic factions in the center as a colonial legislator. After independence, he adopted an autocratic form of government, eliminated opposition both within his party and outside his party by banning all other political parties. In 1963 Tombalbaye dissolved the National Assembly in response to rioting. He began nationalizing the civil service, replacing French administrators with less competent locals. He imposed a &quot;National Loan&quot;, greatly increasing taxing, to fund the nationalization.

In October 1968, Tombalbaye was a guest of President Lyndon B. Johnson in Washington, D.C. Following brief talks with Johnson, he traveled to Texas, meeting with research scientists at ICASALS (International Center for Arid and Semiarid Land Studies), part of Texas Tech University.

Tombalbaye&#x27;s Africanization program failed to account for the large population in the north and center of the country, who were Muslim and did not identify with the Christian and animist south. The Gorane saw independence as a shift of control from French colonials to the south. On 1 November 1965, riots in Guéra Prefecture led to 500 deaths as a result of protest against high taxes and corruption. This sparked a series of disturbances throughout the north and center of the country, compounded by involvement by Chad&#x27;s neighbors, Libya to the north and Sudan to the east. The most prominent movement in this period was the FROLINAT, or &#x27;National Liberation Front of Chad&#x27;, based in Sudan. Though FROLINAT was plagued by rivalry and division, it was able to resist Tombalbaye&#x27;s authoritarianism. Tombalbaye called upon France, Chad&#x27;s former colonial power, for assistance, citing treaties two countries had signed at independence. 
France agreed to enter the fray, provided that Tombalbaye initiate a series of reforms to the army, government, and civil service. Taxes and laws imposed arbitrarily by Tombalbaye were to be rescinded, and the country&#x27;s traditional sultans had their role as tax collectors restored, for which they received 10% of the income. He agreed to France&#x27;s terms in 1969 and Chad embarked on a gradual liberalization process. In elections in 1969, several hundred political prisoners were released from prison, but Tombalbaye was still the only candidate on the ballot.

A further sign of liberalization came in 1971 when Tombalbaye admitted to the Congress of the PPT that he had made mistakes. Steps were taken to reform the government, and more &quot;Gorane&quot; were included in his new government. Order seemed to have been restored, and France withdrew its troops from the country.

During the early 1970s, he chose to follow DRC strongman Mobutu Sese Seko in his move towards remaking African cultural institutions.

Progress came to a grinding halt in August 1971, when an attempted coup d&#x27;état with links to Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi was uncovered. Tombalbaye immediately severed relations with his northern neighbor and even allowed anti-Qadhafi forces to operate from his territory. In return, Qadhafi granted formal recognition and aid to what remained of the FROLINAT opposition to Tombalbaye. Meanwhile, in the south, where Tombalbaye had his greatest support, he responded to a strike by students by replacing the popular Chief of Staff Jacques Doumro with Colonel Félix Malloum. Chad was in the grip of a crippling drought, and Tombalbaye rescinded his amnesty to political prisoners. By the end of 1972, over 1,000 political prisoners had been arrested. At the same time, he also made overtures to the Arab world, reducing Libyan support for, and fomenting infighting in, FROLINAT.

Nevertheless, Tombalbaye felt insecure with his own government as well. Tombalbaye arrested major PPT leaders, including Malloum, for allegedly using witchcraft to overthrow him in what was known as the &quot;Black Sheep Plot&quot;, for the animals they allegedly sacrificed. The politician Kalthouma Nguembang was also implicated in this plot; she was arrested and tortured as a result.

In August, Tombalbaye disbanded the PPT and replaced it with the National Movement for the Cultural and Social Revolution (MNRCS). Under the guise of &quot;authenticité&quot;, the new movement promoted Africanization: the capital of Fort-Lamy was renamed N&#x27;Djamena and Tombalbaye himself changed his given name from François to Ngarta. Christianity was disparaged, missionaries were expelled, and all non-Muslim males in the south between the ages of sixteen and fifty were required to undergo traditional initiation rites known as &quot;yondo&quot; to gain promotion in the civil service and the military. These rites, however, were native to only one of Chad&#x27;s ethnic groups, Tombalbaye&#x27;s own Sara people, and even then, only to a subgroup of that people. To everyone else, the rituals, which included floggings, burning with coals, and mock burials, were harsh and foreign.

==Overthrow and death==

Meanwhile, the drought worsened throughout Africa, so to improve the dismal economy, people were forced to &quot;volunteer&quot; in a major effort to increase cotton production. With his support in the south diminished, Tombalbaye lashed out at the army, making arbitrary promotions and demotions. Finally, on 13 April 1975, after some of the country&#x27;s leading officers had been arrested for involvement in an alleged coup, he was reportedly shot in his own palace, succumbing to his gunshot wounds afterwards. His body was secretly buried in Faya. The military installed Félix Malloum, by then a general, as the new head of state.

<doc id="200182" wikidata="Q1447198" url="?curid=200182" title="Cytokinesis">
<text>Cytokinesis () is the part of the cell division process and part of mitosis during which the cytoplasm of a single eukaryotic cell divides into two daughter cells. Cytoplasmic division begins during or after the late stages of nuclear division in mitosis and meiosis. During cytokinesis the spindle apparatus partitions and transports duplicated chromatids into the cytoplasm of the separating daughter cells. It thereby ensures that chromosome number and complement are maintained from one generation to the next and that, except in special cases, the daughter cells will be functional copies of the parent cell. After the completion of the telophase and cytokinesis, each daughter cell enters the interphase of the cell cycle.

Particular functions demand various deviations from the process of symmetrical cytokinesis; for example in oogenesis in animals the ovum takes almost all the cytoplasm and organelles. This leaves very little for the resulting polar bodies, which in most species die without function, though they do take on various special functions in other species.
Another form of mitosis occurs in tissues such as liver and skeletal muscle; it omits cytokinesis, thereby yielding multinucleate cells (&quot;see syncytium&quot;).

Plant cytokinesis differs from animal cytokinesis, partly because of the rigidity of plant cell walls. Instead of plant cells forming a cleavage furrow such as develops between animal daughter cells, a dividing structure known as the cell plate forms in the cytoplasm and grows into a new, doubled cell wall between plant daughter cells. It divides the cell into two daughter cells.

Cytokinesis largely resembles the prokaryotic process of binary fission, but because of differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell structures and functions, the mechanisms differ. For instance, a bacterial cell has a Circular chromosome (a single chromosome in the form of a closed loop), in contrast to the linear, usually multiple, chromosomes of eukaryote. Accordingly, bacteria construct no mitotic spindle in cell division. Also, duplication of prokaryotic DNA takes place during the actual separation of chromosomes; in mitosis, duplication takes place during the interphase before mitosis begins, though the daughter chromatids don&#x27;t separate completely before the anaphase.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word &quot;cytokinesis&quot; () uses combining forms of &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, Neo-Latin from Classical Latin and Ancient Greek, reflecting &quot;cell&quot; and &quot;kinesis&quot; (&quot;motion, movement&quot;). It was coined by Charles Otis Whitman in 1887.

Origin of this term is from Greek (&#x27;, a hollow), Latin derivative &#x27; (cellular), Greek (&quot;&quot;, movement).

== Animal cell ==
Animal cell cytokinesis begins shortly after the onset of sister chromatid separation in the anaphase of mitosis. The process can be divided to the following distinct steps: anaphase spindle reorganization, division plane specification, actin-myosin ring assembly and contraction, and abscission. Faithful partitioning of the genome to emerging daughter cells is ensured through the tight temporal coordination of the above individual events by molecular signaling pathways.

===Anaphase spindle reorganization===
Animal cell cytokinesis starts with the stabilization of microtubules and reorganization of the mitotic spindle to form the central spindle. The central spindle (or &quot;spindle midzone&quot;) forms when non-kinetochore microtubule fibers are bundled between the spindle poles. A number of different species including &quot;H. sapiens&quot;, &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; and &quot;C. elegans&quot; require the central spindle in order to efficiently undergo cytokinesis, although the specific phenotype associated with its absence varies from one species to the next (for example, certain Drosophila cell types are incapable of forming a cleavage furrow without the central spindle, whereas in both &quot;C. elegans&quot; embryos and human tissue culture cells a cleavage furrow is observed to form and ingress, but then regress before cytokinesis is complete). 
The process of mitotic spindle reorganization and central spindle formation is caused by the decline of CDK1 activity during anaphase. The decline of CDK1 activity at the metaphase-anaphase transition leads to dephosphorylating of inhibitory sites on multiple central spindle components. First of all, the removal of a CDK1 phosphorylation from a subunit of the CPC (the chromosomal passenger complex) allows its translocalization to the central spindle from the centromeres, where it is located during metaphase. Besides being a structural component of the central spindle itself, CPC also plays a role in the phosphoregulation of other central spindle components, including PRC1 (microtubule-bundling protein required for cytokinesis 1) and MKLP1 (a kinesin motor protein). Originally inhibited by CDK1-mediated phosphorylation, PRC1 is now able to form a homodimer that selectively binds to the interface between antiparallel microtubules, facilitating spatial organization of the microtubules of the central spindle. MKLP1, together with the Rho-family GTPase activating protein CYK-4 (also termed MgcRacGAP), forms the centralspindlin complex. Centralspindlin binds to the central spindle as higher-order clusters. The centralspindlin cluster formation is promoted by phosphorylation of MLKP1 by Aurora B, a component of CPC. In short, the self-assembly of central spindle is initiated through the phosphoregulation of multiple central spindle components by the decline of CDK1 activity, either directly or indirectly, at the metaphase-anaphase transition. The central spindle may have multiple functions in cytokinesis including the control of cleavage furrow positioning, the delivery of membrane vesicles to the cleavage furrow, and the formation of the midbody structure that is required for the final steps of division.

===Division plane specification===
The second step of animal cell cytokinesis involves division plane specification and cytokinetic furrow formation. Precise positioning of the division plane between the two masses of segregated chromosomes is essential to prevent chromosome loss. Meanwhile, the mechanism by which the spindle determines the division plane in animal cells is perhaps the most enduring mystery in cytokinesis and a matter of intense debate. There exist three hypotheses of furrow induction. The first is the astral stimulation hypothesis, which postulates that astral microtubules from the spindle poles carry a furrow-inducing signal to the cell cortex, where signals from two poles are somehow focused into a ring at the spindle. A second possibility, called the central spindle hypothesis, is that the cleavage furrow is induced by a positive stimulus that originates in the central spindle equator. The central spindle may contribute to the specification of the division plane by promoting concentration and activation of the small GTPase RhoA at the equatorial cortex. A third hypothesis is the astral relaxation hypothesis. It postulates that active actin-myosin bundles are distributed throughout the cell cortex, and inhibition of their contraction near the spindle poles results in a gradient of contractile activity that is highest at the midpoint between poles. In other words, astral microtubules generate a negative signal that increases cortical relaxation close to the poles. Genetic and laser-micromanipulation studies in C. elegans embryos have shown that the spindle sends two redundant signals to the cell cortex, one originating from the central spindle, and a second signal deriving from the spindle aster, suggesting the involvement of multiple mechanisms combined in the positioning of the cleavage furrow. The predominance of one particular signal varies between cell types and organisms. And the multitude and partial redundancy of signals may be required to make the system robust and to increase spatial precision.

===Actin-myosin ring assembly and contraction===
At the cytokinesis cleavage furrow, it is the actin-myosin contractile ring that drives the cleavage process, during which cell membrane and wall grow inward, which eventually pinches the mother cell in two. The key components of this ring are the filamentous protein actin and the motor protein myosin II. The contractile ring assembles equatorially (in the middle of the cell) at the cell cortex (adjacent to the cell membrane). Rho protein family (RhoA protein in mammalian cells) is a key regulator of contractile ring formation and contraction in animal cells. The RhoA pathway promotes assembly of the actin-myosin ring by two main effectors. First, RhoA stimulates nucleation of unbranched actin filaments by activation of Diaphanous-related formins. This local generation of new actin filaments is important for the contractile ring formation. This actin filament formation process also requires a protein called profilin, which binds to actin monomers and helps load them onto the filament end. Second, RhoA promotes myosin II activation by the kinase ROCK, which activates myosin II directly by phosphorylation of the myosin light chain and also inhibits myosin phosphatase by phosphorylation of the phosphatase-targeting subunit MYPT. Besides actin and myosin II, the contractile ring contains the scaffolding protein anillin. Anillin binds to actin, myosin, RhoA, and CYK-4, and thereby links the equatorial cortex with the signals from the central spindle. It also contributes to the linkage of the actin-myosin ring to the plasma membrane. Additionally, anillin generates contractile forces by rectifying thermal fluctuations. Another protein, septin, has also been speculated to serve as a structural scaffold on which the cytokinesis apparatus is organized. Following its assembly, contraction of the actin-myosin ring leads to ingression of the attached plasma membrane, which partitions the cytoplasm into two domains of emerging sister cells. The force for the contractile processes is generated by movements along actin by the motor protein myosin II. Myosin II uses the free energy released when ATP is hydrolyzed to move along these actin filaments, constricting the cell membrane to form a cleavage furrow. Continued hydrolysis causes this cleavage furrow to ingress (move inwards), a striking process that is clearly visible through a light microscope.

===Abscission===

The cytokinetic furrow ingresses until a midbody structure (composed of electron-dense, proteinaceous material) is formed, where the actin-myosin ring has reached a diameter of about 1–2 μm. Most animal cell types remain connected by an intercellular cytokinetic bridge for up to several hours until they are split by an actin-independent process termed abscission, the last step of cytokinesis. 

The process of abscission physically cleaves the midbody into two. Abscission proceeds by removal of cytoskeletal structures from the cytokinetic bridge, constriction of the cell cortex, and plasma membrane fission. The intercellular bridge is filled with dense bundles of antiparallel microtubules that derive from the central spindle. These microtubules overlap at the midbody, which is generally thought to be a targeting platform for the abscission machinery. 

The microtubule severing protein spastin is largely responsible for the disassembly of microtubule bundles inside the intercellular bridge. Complete cortical constriction also requires removal of the underlying cytoskeletal structures. Actin filament disassembly during late cytokinesis depends on the PKCε–14-3-3 complex, which inactivates RhoA after furrow ingression. Actin disassembly is further controlled by the GTPase Rab35 and its effector, the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase OCRL. The final step of abscission is controlled by the recruitment and polymerization of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport III (ESCRT-III), which serves to physically constrict and separate the plasma membrane of the two adjoined daughter cells.

===Timing cytokinesis===

Cytokinesis must be temporally controlled to ensure that it occurs only after sister chromatids separate during the anaphase portion of normal proliferative cell divisions. To achieve this, many components of the cytokinesis machinery are highly regulated to ensure that they are able to perform a particular function at only a particular stage of the cell cycle. Cytokinesis happens only after APC binds with CDC20. This allows for the separation of chromosomes and myosin to work simultaneously.

After cytokinesis, non-kinetochore microtubules reorganize and disappear into a new cytoskeleton as the cell cycle returns to interphase (see also cell cycle).

== Plant cell ==
Due to the presence of a cell wall, cytokinesis in plant cells is significantly different from that in animal cells, Rather than forming a contractile ring, plant cells construct a cell plate in the middle of the cell. The stages of cell plate formation include (1) creation of the phragmoplast, an array of microtubules that guides and supports the formation of the cell plate; (2) trafficking of vesicles to the division plane and their fusion to generate a tubular-vesicular network; (3) continued fusion of membrane tubules and their transformation into membrane sheets upon the deposition of callose, followed by deposition of cellulose and other cell wall components; (4) recycling of excess membrane and other material from the cell plate; and (5) fusion with the parental cell wall

The phragmoplast is assembled from the remnants of the mitotic spindle, and serves as a track for the trafficking of vesicles to the phragmoplast midzone. These vesicles contain lipids, proteins and carbohydrates needed for the formation of a new cell boundary. Electron tomographic studies have identified the Golgi apparatus as the source of these vesicles, but other studies have suggested that they contain endocytosed material as well.

These tubules then widen and fuse laterally with each other, eventually forming a planar, fenestrated sheet [8]. As the cell plate matures, large amounts of membrane material are removed via clathrin-mediated endocytosis [7] Eventually, the edges of the cell plate fuse with the parental plasma membrane, often in an asymmetrical fashion, thus completing cytokinesis. The remaining fenestrae contain strands of endoplasmic reticulum passing through them, and are thought to be the precursors of plasmodesmata [8].

The construction of the new cell wall begins within the lumen of the narrow tubules of the young cell plate. The order in which different cell wall components are deposited has been determined largely by immuno-electron microscopy. The first components to arrive are pectins, hemicelluloses, and arabinogalactan proteins carried by the secretory vesicles that fuse to form the cell plate. The next component to be added is callose, which is polymerized directly at the cell plate by callose synthases. As the cell plate continues to mature and fuses with the parental plasma membrane, the callose is slowly replaced with cellulose, the primary component of a mature cell wall [6]. The middle lamella (a glue-like layer containing pectin) develops from the cell plate, serving to bind the cell walls of adjoining cells together.

==Forces==

===Animal cells===
Cytokinetic furrow ingression is powered by Type II Myosin ATPase. Since Myosins are recruited to the medial region, the contractile forces acting on the cortex resemble a &#x27;purse string&#x27; constriction pulling inwards. This leads to the inward constriction. The plasma membrane by virtue of its close association with the cortex via crosslinker proteins To the constriction of the cleavage furrow, the total surface area should be increased by supplying the plasma membrane via exocytosis.

Theoretical models show that symmetric constriction requires both lateral stabilization and constriction forces. Reduction of external pressure and of surface tension (by membrane trafficking) reduce the required stabilization and constriction forces. 

==Proteins involved in cytokinesis==

CEP55 is a mitotic phosphoprotein that plays a key role in cytokinesis, the final stage of cell division.
==Clinical significance==
In some cases, a cell may divide its genetic material and grow in size, but fail to undergo cytokinesis. This results in larger cells with more than one nucleus. Usually this is an unwanted aberration and can be a sign of cancerous cells.

<text>In cell biology, the spindle apparatus is the cytoskeletal structure of eukaryotic cells that forms during cell division to separate sister chromatids between daughter cells. It is referred to as the mitotic spindle during mitosis, a process that produces genetically identical daughter cells, or the meiotic spindle during meiosis, a process that produces gametes with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell.

Besides chromosomes, the spindle apparatus is composed of hundreds of proteins. Microtubules comprise the most abundant components of the machinery.

==Spindle structure==

Attachment of microtubules to chromosomes is mediated by kinetochores, which actively monitor spindle formation and prevent premature anaphase onset. Microtubule polymerization and depolymerization dynamic drive chromosome congression. Depolymerization of microtubules generates tension at kinetochores; bipolar attachment of sister kinetochores to microtubules emanating from opposite cell poles couples opposing tension forces, aligning chromosomes at the cell equator and poising them for segregation to daughter cells. Once every chromosome is bi-oriented, anaphase commences and cohesin, which couples sister chromatids, is severed, permitting the transit of the sister chromatids to opposite poles.

The cellular spindle apparatus includes the spindle microtubules, associated proteins, which include kinesin and dynein molecular motors, condensed chromosomes, and any centrosomes or asters that may be present at the spindle poles depending on the cell type. The spindle apparatus is vaguely ellipsoid in cross section and tapers at the ends. In the wide middle portion, known as the spindle midzone, antiparallel microtubules are bundled by kinesins. At the pointed ends, known as spindle poles, microtubules are nucleated by the centrosomes in most animal cells. &quot;Acentrosomal&quot; or &quot;anastral&quot; spindles lack centrosomes or asters at the spindle poles, respectively, and occur for example during female meiosis in most animals. In this instance, a Ran GTP gradient is the main regulator of spindle microtubule organization and assembly. In fungi, spindles form between spindle pole bodies embedded in the nuclear envelope, which does not break down during mitosis.

===Microtubule-associated proteins and spindle dynamics===

The dynamic lengthening and shortening of spindle microtubules, through a process known as dynamic instability determines to a large extent the shape of the mitotic spindle and promotes the proper alignment of chromosomes at the spindle midzone. Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) associate with microtubules at the midzone and the spindle poles to regulate their dynamics. γ-tubulin is a specialized tubulin variant that assembles into a ring complex called γ-TuRC which nucleates polymerization of α/β tubulin heterodimers into microtubules. Recruitment of γ-TuRC to the pericentrosomal region stabilizes microtubule minus-ends and anchors them near the microtubule-organizing center. The microtubule-associated protein Augmin acts in conjunction with γ-TURC to nucleate new microtubules off of existing microtubules.

The growing ends of microtubules are protected against catastrophe by the action of plus-end microtubule tracking proteins (+TIPs) to promote their association with kinetochores at the midzone. CLIP170 was shown to localize near microtubule plus-ends in HeLa cells and to accumulate in kinetochores during prometaphase. Although how CLIP170 recognizes plus-ends remains unclear, it has been shown that its homologues protect against catastrophe and promote rescue, suggesting a role for CLIP170 in stabilizing plus-ends and possibly mediating their direct attachment to kinetochores. CLIP-associated proteins like CLASP1 in humans have also been shown to localize to plus-ends and the outer kinetochore as well as to modulate the dynamics of kinetochore microtubules (Maiato 2003). CLASP homologues in &quot;Drosophila&quot;, &quot;Xenopus&quot;, and yeast are required for proper spindle assembly; in mammals, CLASP1 and CLASP2 both contribute to proper spindle assembly and microtubule dynamics in anaphase. Plus-end polymerization may be further moderated by the EB1 protein, which directly binds the growing ends of microtubules and coordinates the binding of other +TIPs.

Opposing the action of these microtubule-stabilizing proteins are a number of microtubule-depolymerizing factors which permit the dynamic remodeling of the mitotic spindle to promote chromosome congression and attainment of bipolarity. The kinesin-13 superfamily of MAPs contains a class of plus-end-directed motor proteins with associated microtubule depolymerization activity including the well-studied mammalian MCAK and &quot;Xenopus&quot; XKCM1. MCAK localizes to the growing tips of microtubules at kinetochores where it can trigger catastrophe in direct competition with stabilizing +TIP activity. These proteins harness the energy of ATP hydrolysis to induce destabilizing conformational changes in protofilament structure that cause kinesin release and microtubule depolymerization. Loss of their activity results in numerous mitotic defects. Additional microtubule destabilizing proteins include Op18/stathmin and katanin which have roles in remodeling the mitotic spindle as well as promoting chromosome segregation during anaphase.

The activities of these MAPs are carefully regulated to maintain proper microtubule dynamics during spindle assembly, with many of these proteins serving as Aurora and Polo-like kinase substrates.

==Organizing the spindle apparatus==
In a properly formed mitotic spindle, bi-oriented chromosomes are aligned along the equator of the cell with spindle microtubules oriented roughly perpendicular to the chromosomes, their plus-ends embedded in kinetochores and their minus-ends anchored at the cell poles. The precise orientation of this complex is required to ensure accurate chromosome segregation and to specify the cell division plane. However, it remains unclear how the spindle becomes organized. Two models predominate the field, which are synergistic and not mutually exclusive. In the &quot;search-and-capture model&quot;, the spindle is predominantly organized by the poleward separation of centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs). Spindle microtubules emanate from centrosomes and &#x27;seek&#x27; out kinetochores; when they bind a kinetochore they become stabilized and exert tension on the chromosomes. In an alternative &quot;self assembly&quot; model, microtubules undergo acentrosomal nucleation among the condensed chromosomes. Constrained by cellular dimensions, lateral associations with antiparallel microtubules via motor proteins, and end-on attachments to kinetochores, microtubules naturally adopt a spindle-like structure with chromosomes aligned along the cell equator.

===Centrosome-mediated &quot;search-and-capture&quot; model===
In this model, microtubules are nucleated at microtubule organizing centers and undergo rapid growth and catastrophe to &#x27;search&#x27; the cytoplasm for kinetochores. Once they bind a kinetochore, they are stabilized and their dynamics are reduced. The newly mono-oriented chromosome oscillates in space near the pole to which it is attached until a microtubule from the opposite pole binds the sister kinetochore. This second attachment further stabilizes kinetochore attachment to the mitotic spindle. Gradually, the bi-oriented chromosome is pulled towards the center of the cell until microtubule tension is balanced on both sides of the centromere; the congressed chromosome then oscillates at the metaphase plate until anaphase onset releases cohesion of the sister chromatids.

In this model, microtubule organizing centers are localized to the cell poles, their separation driven by microtubule polymerization and &#x27;sliding&#x27; of antiparallel spindle microtubules with respect to one another at the spindle midzone mediated by bipolar, plus-end-directed kinesins. Such sliding forces may account not only for spindle pole separation early in mitosis, but also spindle elongation during late anaphase.

===Chromatin-mediated self-organization of the mitotic spindle===
In contrast to the search-and-capture mechanism in which centrosomes largely dictate the organization of the mitotic spindle, this model proposes that microtubules are nucleated acentrosomally near chromosomes and spontaneously assemble into anti-parallel bundles and adopt a spindle-like structure. Classic experiments by Heald and Karsenti show that functional mitotic spindles and nuclei form around DNA-coated beads incubated in &quot;Xenopus&quot; egg extracts and that bipolar arrays of microtubules are formed in the absence of centrosomes and kinetochores. Indeed, it has also been shown that laser ablation of centrosomes in vertebrate cells inhibits neither spindle assembly nor chromosome segregation. Under this scheme, the shape and size of the mitotic spindle are a function of the biophysical properties of the cross-linking motor proteins.

==Chromatin-mediated microtubule nucleation by the Ran GTP gradient==

The guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPase Ran (Regulator of chromosome condensation 1 or RCC1) is attached to nucleosomes via core histones H2A and H2B. Thus, a gradient of GTP-bound Ran is generated around the vicinity of mitotic chromatin. Glass beads coated with RCC1 induce microtubule nucleation and bipolar spindle formation in &quot;Xenopus&quot; egg extracts, revealing that the Ran GTP gradient alone is sufficient for spindle assembly. The gradient triggers release of spindle assembly factors (SAFs) from inhibitory interactions via the transport proteins importin β/α. The unbound SAFs then promote microtubule nucleation and stabilization around mitotic chromatin, and spindle bipolarity is organized by microtubule motor proteins.

==Regulation of spindle assembly==
Spindle assembly is largely regulated by phosphorylation events catalyzed by mitotic kinases.
Cyclin dependent kinase complexes (CDKs) are activated by mitotic cyclins, whose translation increases during mitosis. CDK1 (also called CDC2) is considered the main mitotic kinase in mammalian cells and is activated by Cyclin B1. 
Aurora kinases are required for proper spindle assembly and separation. Aurora A associates with centrosomes and is believed to regulate mitotic entry. Aurora B is a member of the chromosomal passenger complex and mediates chromosome-microtubule attachment and sister chromatid cohesion. 
Polo-like kinase, also known as PLK, especially PLK1 has important roles in the spindle maintenance by regulating microtubule dynamics.

==Mitotic chromosome structure ==
By the end of DNA replication, sister chromatids are bound together in an amorphous mass of tangled DNA and protein. Mitotic entry triggers a dramatic reorganization of the duplicated genome, resulting in sister chromatids that are disentangled and separated from one another. Chromosomes also shorten in length, up to 10,000-fold in animal cells, in a process called condensation. Condensation begins in prophase and chromosomes are maximally compacted into rod-shaped structures by the time they are aligned in the middle of the spindle at metaphase. This gives mitotic chromosomes the classic &quot;X&quot; shape seen in karyotypes, with each condensed sister chromatid linked along their lengths by cohesin proteins and joined, often near the center, at the centromere.

While these dynamic rearrangements are vitally important to ensure accurate and high-fidelity segregation of the genome, our understanding of mitotic chromosome structure remains largely incomplete. A few specific molecular players have been identified, however: Topoisomerase II uses ATP hydrolysis to catalyze decatenation of DNA entanglements, promoting sister chromatid resolution. Condensins are 5-subunit complexes that also use ATP-hydrolysis to promote chromosome condensation. Experiments in &quot;Xenopus&quot; egg extracts have also implicated linker Histone H1 as an important regulator of mitotic chromosome compaction.

==Mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint==
The completion of spindle formation is a crucial transition point in the cell cycle called the spindle assembly checkpoint. If chromosomes are not properly attached to the mitotic spindle by the time of this checkpoint, the onset of anaphase will be delayed. Failure of this spindle assembly checkpoint can result in aneuploidy and may be involved in aging and the formation of cancer.

==Spindle apparatus orientation ==

Cell division orientation is of major importance for tissue architecture, cell fates and morphogenesis. Cells tend to divide along their long axis according to the so-called Hertwig rule. The axis of cell division is determined by the orientation of the spindle apparatus. Cells divide along the line connecting two centrosomes of the spindle apparatus. After formation, the spindle apparatus undergoes rotation inside the cell. The astral microtubules originating from centrosomes reach the cell membrane where they are pulled towards specific cortical clues. &quot;In vitro&quot;, the distribution of cortical clues is set up by the adhesive pattern. &quot;In vivo&quot; polarity cues are determined by localization of Tricellular junctions localized at cell vertices. The spatial distribution of cortical clues leads to the force field that determine final spindle apparatus orientation and the subsequent orientation of cell division.

<text>A chromatid (Greek &quot;khrōmat-&quot; &#x27;color&#x27; + &quot;-id&quot;) is one half of a duplicated chromosome. Before replication, one chromosome is composed of one DNA molecule. In replication, the DNA molecule is copied, and the two molecules are known as chromatids. During the later stages of cell division these chromatids separate longitudinally to become individual chromosomes.

Chromatid pairs are normally genetically identical, and said to be homozygous. However, if mutations occur, they will present slight differences, in which case they are heterozygous. The pairing of chromatids should not be confused with the ploidy of an organism, which is the number of homologous versions of a chromosome.

==Sister chromatids==

Chromatids may be sister or non-sister chromatids. A sister chromatid is either one of the two chromatids of the same chromosome joined together by a common centromere. A pair of sister chromatids is called a dyad. Once sister chromatids have separated (during the anaphase of mitosis or the anaphase II of meiosis during sexual reproduction), they are again called chromosomes, each having the same genetic mass as one of the individual chromatids that made up its parent. The DNA sequence of two sister chromatids is completely identical (apart from very rare DNA copying errors).

Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) is the exchange of genetic information between two sister chromatids. SCEs can occur during mitosis or meiosis. SCEs appear to primarily reflect DNA recombinational repair processes responding to DNA damage (see article Sister chromatid exchange).

&quot;Non-sister chromatids&quot;, on the other hand, refers to either of the two chromatids of paired homologous chromosomes, that is, the pairing of a paternal chromosome and a maternal chromosome. In chromosomal crossovers, non-sister (homologous) chromatids form chiasmata to exchange genetic material during the prophase I of meiosis (See Homologous chromosome pair).

<text>A crista (; : cristae) is a fold in the inner membrane of a mitochondrion. The name is from the Latin for &quot;crest&quot; or &quot;plume&quot;, and it gives the inner membrane its characteristic wrinkled shape, providing a large amount of surface area for chemical reactions to occur on. This aids aerobic cellular respiration, because the mitochondrion requires oxygen. Cristae are studded with proteins, including ATP synthase and a variety of cytochromes.

==Background==

With the discovery of the dual-membrane nature of mitochondria, the pioneers of mitochondrial ultrastructural research proposed different models for the organization of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Three models proposed were:

*Baffle model – According to Palade (1953), the mitochondrial inner membrane is convoluted in a baffle-like manner with broad openings towards the intra-cristal space. This model entered most textbooks and was widely believed for a long time.
*Septa model – Sjöstrand (1953) suggested that sheets of inner membrane are spanned like septa (plural of septum) through the matrix, separating it into several distinct compartments.
*Crista junction model – Daems and Wisse (1966) proposed that cristae are connected to the inner boundary membrane via tubular structures characterized by rather small diameters, termed crista junctions (CJs). In the middle of 1990s these structures were rediscovered by EM tomography, leading to the establishment of this currently widely accepted model.

More recent research (2019) finds rows of ATP synthase dimers (formerly known as &quot;elementary particles&quot; or &quot;oxysomes&quot;) forming at the cristae. These membrane-curving dimers have a bent shape, and may be the first step to cristae formation. They are situated at the base of the crista. A mitochondrial contact site cristae organizing system (MICOS) protein complex occupies the crista junction. Proteins like OPA1 are involved in cristae remodeling.

Crista are traditionally sorted by shapes into lamellar, tubular, and vesicular cristae. They appear in different cell types. It is debated whether these shapes arise by different pathways.

==Electron transport chain of the cristae==

NADH is oxidized into NAD+, H+ ions, and electrons by an enzyme. FADH2 is also oxidized into H+ ions, electrons, and FAD. As those electrons travel farther through the electron transport chain in the inner membrane, energy is gradually released and used to pump the hydrogen ions from the splitting of NADH and FADH2 into the space between the inner membrane and the outer membrane (called the intermembrane space), creating an electrochemical gradient.

This electrochemical gradient creates potential energy (see &quot;&quot;) across the inner mitochondrial membrane known as the proton-motive force. As a result, chemiosmosis occurs, and the enzyme ATP synthase produces ATP from ADP and a phosphate group. This harnesses the potential energy from the concentration gradient formed by the amount of H+ ions. H+ ions passively pass into the mitochondrial matrix by the ATP synthase, and later help to re-form H2O (water).

The electron transport chain requires a varying supply of electrons in order to properly function and generate ATP. However, the electrons that have entered the electron transport chain would eventually pile up like cars traveling down a blocked one-way street. Those electrons are finally accepted by oxygen (O2). As a result, they form two molecules of water (H2O). By accepting the electrons, oxygen allows the electron transport chain to continue functioning. The chain is organized in the cristae lumen membrane, i.e. the membrane inside the junction.

The electrons from each NADH molecule can form a total of 3 ATP&#x27;s from ADPs and phosphate groups through the electron transport chain, while each FADH2 molecule can produce a total of 2 ATPs.

As a result, 10 NADH molecules (from glycolysis and the Krebs cycle), along with 2 FADH2 molecules, can form a total of 34 ATPs during aerobic respiration (from a single electron transport chain). This means that combined with the Krebs Cycle and glycolysis, the efficiency for the electron transport chain is about 65%, as compared to only 3.5% efficiency for glycolysis alone.

==Function==
The cristae greatly increase the surface area of the inner membrane on which the above-mentioned reactions may take place. A widely accepted hypothesis for the function of the cristae is that the high surface area allows an increased capacity for ATP generation. However, the current model is that active ATP synthase complexes localize preferentially in dimers to the narrow edges of the cristae. Thus, the surface area of mitochondrial membranes allocated to ATP syntheses is actually quite modest.

Mathematical modelling suggested that the optical properties of the cristae in filamentous mitochondria may affect the generation and propagation of light within the tissue.

<doc id="200199" wikidata="Q239771" url="?curid=200199" title="Remora">
<text>The remora (), sometimes called suckerfish or sharksucker, is any of a family (Echeneidae) of ray-finned fish in the order Carangiformes. Depending on species, they grow to long. Their distinctive first dorsal fins take the form of a modified oval, sucker-like organ with slat-like structures that open and close to create suction and take a firm hold against the skin of larger marine animals. The disk is made up of stout, flexible membranes that can be raised and lowered to generate suction. By sliding backward, the remora can increase the suction, or it can release itself by swimming forward. Remoras sometimes attach to small boats, and have been observed attaching to divers as well. They swim well on their own, with a sinuous, or curved, motion.

== Characteristics ==
Remora front dorsal fins have evolved to enable them to adhere by suction to smooth surfaces, and they spend most of their lives clinging to a host animal such as a whale, turtle, shark or ray. It is probably a mutualistic arrangement as the remora can move around on the host, removing ectoparasites and loose flakes of skin, while benefiting from the protection provided by the host and the constant flow of water across its gills. Although many believe that remoras feed off particulate matter from the host&#x27;s meals, some posit alternative theories; they claim their diets to be composed primarily of host feces. Further research is needed to validate the extent of this alternative feeding mechanism.

== Habitat ==

Remoras are tropical open-ocean dwellers, but are occasionally found in temperate or coastal waters if they have attached to large fish that have wandered into these areas. In the mid-Atlantic Ocean, spawning usually takes place in June and July; in the Mediterranean Sea, it occurs in August and September. The sucking disc begins to show when the young fish are about long. When the remora reaches about , the disc is fully formed and the remora can then attach to other animals. The remora&#x27;s lower jaw projects beyond the upper, and the animal lacks a swim bladder.

Some remoras associate with specific host species. They are commonly found attached to sharks, manta rays, whales, turtles, and dugongs, hence the common names &quot;sharksucker&quot; and &quot;whalesucker&quot;. Smaller remoras also fasten onto fish such as tuna and swordfish, and some of the smallest remoras travel in the mouths or gills of large manta rays, ocean sunfish, swordfish and sailfish.

The relationship between a remora and its host is most often taken to be one of commensalism, specifically phoresy.

While some of the relationships are mutualistic, it is believed that dolphins with remoras attached do not benefit from the relationship. The attachment of the remora increases the dolphin&#x27;s drag, which increases the energy needed for swimming. The remora is also thought to irritate the skin of the dolphin.

== Physiology ==
Research into the physiology of the remora has been of significant benefit to the understanding of ventilation costs in fish.

Remoras, like many other fishes, have two different modes of ventilation. Ram ventilation is the process in which at higher speeds, the remora uses the force of the water moving past it to create movement of fluid in the gills. At lower speeds, the remora will use a form of active ventilation, in which the fish actively moves fluid through its gills. In order to use active ventilation, a fish must actively use energy to move the fluid; however, determining this energy cost is normally complicated due to the fish&#x27;s movement when using either method. As a result, the remora has proved invaluable in finding this cost difference (since they will stick to a shark or tube, and hence remain stationary despite the movement, or lack thereof, of water). Experimental data from studies on remora found that the associated cost for active ventilation created a 3.7–5.1% increased energy consumption in order to maintain the same quantity of fluid flow the fish obtained by using ram ventilation.

Other research into the remora&#x27;s physiology came about as a result of studies across multiple taxa, or using the remora as an out-group for certain evolutionary studies. Concerning the latter case, remoras were used as an outgroup when investigating tetrodotoxin resistance in remoras, pufferfish, and related species, finding remoras (specifically &quot;Echeneis naucrates&quot;) had a resistance of 6.1–5.5 M.

== Use for fishing ==
Some cultures use remoras to catch turtles. A cord or rope is fastened to the remora&#x27;s tail, and when a turtle is sighted, the fish is released from the boat; it usually heads directly for the turtle and fastens itself to the turtle&#x27;s shell, and then both remora and turtle are hauled in. Smaller turtles can be pulled completely into the boat by this method, while larger ones are hauled within harpooning range. This practice has been reported throughout the Indian Ocean, especially from eastern Africa near Zanzibar and Mozambique, and from northern Australia near Cape York and Torres Strait.

Similar reports come from Japan and from the Americas. Some of the first records of the &quot;fishing fish&quot; in the Western literature come from the accounts of the second voyage of Christopher Columbus. However, Leo Wiener considers the Columbus accounts to be apocryphal: what was taken for accounts of the Americas may have been, in fact, notes Columbus derived from accounts of the East Indies, his desired destination.

== Mythology ==

In ancient times, the remora was believed to stop a ship from sailing. In Latin, &quot;remora&quot; means &quot;delay&quot;, while the genus name &quot;Echeneis&quot; comes from Greek ἔχειν, &quot;echein&quot; (&quot;to hold&quot;) and ναῦς, &quot;naus&quot; (&quot;a ship&quot;). In a notable account by Pliny the Elder, the remora is blamed for the defeat of Mark Antony at the Battle of Actium and, indirectly, for the death of Caligula. A modern version of the story is given by Jorge Luis Borges in &quot;Book of Imaginary Beings&quot; (1957).

<doc id="200201" wikidata="Q43017" url="?curid=200201" title="Lactic acid fermentation">
<text>Lactic acid fermentation is a metabolic process by which glucose or other six-carbon sugars (also, disaccharides of six-carbon sugars, e.g. sucrose or lactose) are converted into cellular energy and the metabolite lactate, which is lactic acid in solution. It is an anaerobic fermentation reaction that occurs in some bacteria and animal cells, such as muscle cells.

If oxygen is present in the cell, many organisms will bypass fermentation and undergo cellular respiration; however, facultative anaerobic organisms will both ferment and undergo respiration in the presence of oxygen. Sometimes even when oxygen is present and aerobic metabolism is happening in the mitochondria, if pyruvate is building up faster than it can be metabolized, the fermentation will happen anyway.

Lactate dehydrogenase catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate with concomitant interconversion of NADH and NAD+.

In &quot;homolactic fermentation&quot;, one molecule of glucose is ultimately converted to two molecules of lactic acid. &quot;Heterolactic fermentation&quot;, by contrast, yields carbon dioxide and ethanol in addition to lactic acid, in a process called the phosphoketolase pathway.

==History==
Chemical analysis of archaeological finds show that milk fermentation had been used since prehistory; its first applications were probably a part of the Neolithic Revolution. Since milk naturally contains lactic acid bacteria, the discovery of the fermentation process was quite evident, since it happens spontaneously at an adequate temperature. The problem of these first farmers was that fresh milk is nearly indigestible by adults, so they had an interest to discover this mechanism. In fact, lactic acid bacteria contain the needed enzymes to digest lactose, and their populations multiply strongly during the fermentation. Therefore, milk fermented even a short time contains enough enzymes to digest the lactose molecules, after the milk is in the human body, which allows adults to consume it. Even safer was a longer fermentation, which was practiced for cheesemaking. This process was also discovered a very long time ago, which is proven by recipes for cheese production on Cuneiform scripts, the first written documents that exist, and later in Babylonian and Egyptian texts. There is a theory of competitive advantage related to fermented milk products. This theory suggests that the women of these first settled agricultural civilisations could shorten the time between two children thanks to the additional lactose uptake from milk consumption. This factor may have given them an important advantage to out-compete the hunter-gatherer societies. 

With the increasing consumption of milk products these societies developed a lactase persistence by epigenetic inheritance, which means that the milk-digesting enzyme lactase was present in their bodies during the whole lifetime, so they could drink unfermented milk as adults too. This early habituation to lactose consumption in the first settler societies can still be observed today in regional differences of this mutation&#x27;s concentration. It is estimated that about 65% of world population still lacks it. Since these first societies came from regions around eastern Turkey to central Europe, the gene appears more frequently there and in North America, as it was settled by Europeans. It is because of the dominance of this mutation that Western cultures believe it is unusual to have a lactose intolerance, when it is in fact more common than the mutation. On the contrary, lactose intolerance is much more present in Asian countries. 

Milk products and their fermentation have had an important influence on some cultures&#x27; development. This is the case in Mongolia, where people often practice a pastoral form of agriculture. The milk that they produce and consume in these cultures is mainly mare milk and has a long tradition. But not every part or product of the fresh milk has the same meaning. For instance, the fattier part on the top, the &quot;deež&quot;, is seen as the most valuable part and is therefore often used to honor guests.

Very important with often a traditional meaning as well are fermentation products of mare milk, like for example the slightly-alcoholic yogurt kumis. Consumption of these peaks during cultural festivities such as the Mongolian lunar new year (in spring). The time of this celebration is called the &quot;white month&quot;, which indicates that milk products (called &quot;white food&quot; together with starchy vegetables, in comparison to meat products, called &quot;black food&quot;) are a central part of this tradition. The purpose of these festivities is to &quot;close&quot; the past year – clean the house or the yurt, honor the animals for having provided their food, and prepare everything for the coming summer season – to be ready to &quot;open&quot; the new year. Consuming white food in this festive context is a way to connect to the past and to a national identity, which is the Mongolian empire personified by Genghis Khan. During the time of this empire, the fermented mare milk was the drink to honor and thank warriors and leading persons, it was not meant for everybody. Although it eventually became a drink for normal people, it has kept its honorable meaning. Like many other traditions, this one feels the influence of globalization. Other products, like industrial yogurt, coming mainly from China and western countries, have tended to replace it more and more, mainly in urban areas. However, in rural and poorer regions it is still of great importance.

Although this chemical process had been used in food production for thousand of years, microbial lactic acid fermentation was not properly described before much later. During the 19th century, several chemists discovered some fundamental concepts of organic chemistry. One of these was the French chemist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, who was especially interested in fermentation processes, and he passed this fascination to one of his best students, Justus von Liebig. With a difference of some years, each of them described, together with colleagues, the chemical structure of the lactic acid molecule as we know it today. They had a purely chemical understanding of the fermentation process; it could not be observed using a microscope, and could only be optimized by chemical catalyzers. In 1857, the French chemist Louis Pasteur first described lactic acid as the product of a microbial fermentation. During this time, he worked at the University of Lille, where a local distillery asked him for advice concerning some fermentation problems. Per chance and with the badly equipped laboratory he had at that time, he was able to discover that in this distillery, two fermentations were taking place, a lactic acid one and an alcoholic one, both induced by microorganisms. He then continued the research on these discoveries in Paris, where he also published his theories that presented a stable contradiction to the purely chemical version represented by Liebig and his followers. Even though Pasteur described some concepts that are still accepted today, Liebig refused to accept them. But even Pasteur himself wrote that he was &quot;driven&quot; to a completely new understanding of this chemical phenomenon. Although Pasteur didn&#x27;t find every detail of this process, he still discovered the main mechanism of how microbial lactic acid fermentation works. He was the first to describe fermentation as a &quot;form of life without air&quot;.

==Biochemistry==
===Homofermentative process===
Homofermentative bacteria convert glucose to two molecules of lactate and use this reaction to perform substrate-level phosphorylation to make two molecules of ATP:
:Glucose + 2 ADP + 2 Pi → 2 Lactate + 2 ATP

===Heterofermentative process===
Heterofermentative bacteria produce less lactate and less ATP, but produce several other end products:
:Glucose + ADP + Pi → Lactate + Ethanol + CO2 + ATP
Examples include &quot;Leuconostoc mesenteroides&quot;, &quot;Lactobacillus bifermentous&quot;, and &quot;Leuconostoc lactis&quot;.

===Bifidum pathway===
&quot;Bifidobacterium bifidum&quot; utilizes a lactic acid fermentation pathway that produces more ATP than either homolactic fermentation or heterolactic fermentation:
:2 Glucose + 5 ADP + 5 Pi → 3 Acetate + 2 Lactate + 5 ATP

== Major genera of lactose-fermenting bacteria==

Some major bacterial strains identified as being able to ferment lactose are in the genera &quot;Escherichia, Citrobacter, Enterobacter&quot; and &quot;Klebsiella .&quot; All four of these groups fall underneath the family of &quot;Enterobacteriaceae.&quot; These four genera are able to be separated from each other by using biochemical testing, and simple biological tests are readily available. Apart from whole-sequence genomics, common tests include H2S production, motility and citrate use, indole, methyl red and Voges-Proskauer tests.

==Applications==
Lactic acid fermentation is used in many areas of the world to produce foods that cannot be produced through other methods. The most commercially important genus of lactic acid-fermenting bacteria is &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;, though other bacteria and even yeast are sometimes used. Two of the most common applications of lactic acid fermentation are in the production of yogurt and sauerkraut.

=== Pickles===
===Fermented fish===

In some Asian cuisines, fish is traditionally fermented with rice to produce lactic acid that preserves the fish. Examples of these dishes include burong isda of the Philippines; narezushi of Japan; and pla ra of Thailand. The same process is also used for shrimp in the Philippines in the dish known as balao-balao.

=== Kimchi===

Kimchi also uses lactic acid fermentation.

=== Sauerkraut===

Lactic acid fermentation is also used in the production of sauerkraut. The main type of bacteria used in the production of sauerkraut is of the genus &quot;Leuconostoc&quot;.

As in yogurt, when the acidity rises due to lactic acid-fermenting organisms, many other pathogenic microorganisms are killed. The bacteria produce lactic acid, as well as simple alcohols and other hydrocarbons. These may then combine to form esters, contributing to the unique flavor of sauerkraut.

=== Sour beer===

Lactic acid is a component in the production of sour beers, including Lambics and Berliner Weisses.

=== Yogurt===

The main method of producing yogurt is through the lactic acid fermentation of milk with harmless bacteria. The primary bacteria used are typically &quot;Lactobacillus bulgaricus&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus thermophilus&quot;, and United States as well as European law requires all yogurts to contain these two cultures (though others may be added as probiotic cultures). These bacteria produce lactic acid in the milk culture, decreasing its pH and causing it to congeal. The bacteria also produce compounds that give yogurt its distinctive flavor. An additional effect of the lowered pH is the incompatibility of the acidic environment with many other types of harmful bacteria.

For a probiotic yogurt, additional types of bacteria such as &quot;Lactobacillus acidophilus&quot; are also added to the culture.

=== In vegetables===
Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) already exists as part of the natural flora in most vegetables. Lettuce and cabbage were examined to determine the types of lactic acid bacteria that exist in the leaves. Different types of LAB will produce different types of silage fermentation, which is the fermentation of the leafy foliage. Silage fermentation is an anaerobic reaction that reduces sugars to fermentation byproducts like lactic acid.

=== Physiological===
Lactobacillus fermentation and accompanying production of acid provides a protective vaginal microbiome that protects against the proliferation of pathogenic organisms.

=== Lactate fermentation and muscle cramps===
During the 1990s, the lactic acid hypothesis was created to explain why people experienced burning or muscle cramps that occurred during and after intense exercise. The hypothesis proposes that a lack of oxygen in muscle cells results in a switch from cellular respiration to fermentation. Lactic acid created as a byproduct of fermentation of pyruvate from glycolysis accumulates in muscles causing a burning sensation and cramps.

Research from 2006 has suggested that acidosis isn&#x27;t the main cause of muscle cramps. Instead cramps may be due to a lack of potassium in muscles, leading to contractions under high stress. 

Animals, in fact, do not produce lactic acid during fermentation. Despite the common use of the term lactic acid in the literature, the byproduct of fermentation in animal cells is lactate. 

Another change to the lactic acid hypothesis is that when sodium lactate is inside of the body, there is a higher period of exhaustion in the host after a period of exercise.

Lactate fermentation is important to muscle cell physiology. When muscle cells are undergoing intense activity, like sprinting, they need energy quickly. There is only enough ATP stored in muscles cells to last a few seconds of sprinting. The cells then default to fermentation, since they are in an anaerobic environment. Through lactate fermentation, muscle cells are able to regenerate NAD+ to continue glycolysis, even under strenuous activity.

The vaginal environment is heavily influenced by lactic acid producing bacteria. &quot;Lactobacilli&quot; spp. that live in the vaginal canal assist in pH control. If the pH in the vagina becomes too basic, more lactic acid will be produced to lower the pH back to a more acidic level. Lactic acid producing bacteria also act as a protective barrier against possible pathogens such as bacterial vaginosis and vaginitis species, different fungi, and protozoa through the production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibacterial compounds. It is unclear if further use of lactic acid, through fermentation, in the vaginal canal is present.

=== Benefits for the lactose intolerant===
In small amounts, lactic acid is good for the human body by providing energy and substrates while it moves through the cycle. In lactose intolerant people, the fermentation of lactose to lactic acid has been shown in small studies to help lactose intolerant people. The process of fermentation limits the amount of lactose available. With the amount of lactose lowered, there is less build up inside of the body, reducing bloating. Success of lactic fermentation was most evident in yogurt cultures. Further studies are being conducted on other milk products like acidophilus milk.

<text>Gregory Walter Graffin (born November 6, 1964) is an American singer and evolutionary biologist. He is most recognized as the lead vocalist and only constant member of rock band Bad Religion, which he co-founded in 1980. He embarked on a solo career in 1997, when he released the album &quot;American Lesion&quot;. His follow-up album, &quot;Cold as the Clay&quot;, was released nine years later. His newest solo work is &quot;Millport&quot;, released in 2017. 

Graffin obtained his PhD in zoology at Cornell University and has lectured courses in natural sciences at both the University of California, Los Angeles and at Cornell University.

==Career==
===Bad Religion===

In 1980, at the age of 15, Graffin and a few high school classmates formed Bad Religion in Southern California&#x27;s San Fernando Valley. After making a name for themselves in the Los Angeles punk scene, releasing two EPs and two full-length albums, they disbanded around 1985. However, Bad Religion reformed in 1986 with a new line-up, consisting of Graffin on vocals, Brett Gurewitz and Greg Hetson on guitars, Jay Bentley on bass, and Pete Finestone on drums. In 1988, they released &quot;Suffer&quot;, which was a comeback for Bad Religion as well as a watershed for the Southern California punk sound popularized by guitarist Gurewitz&#x27;s Epitaph Records. The reunion line-up made two more records before Finestone left the band in 1991.

Bad Religion has been known for its articulate and often politically charged lyrics as well as its fast-paced harmony, melody and counterpoint. Graffin and Gurewitz are the band&#x27;s two main songwriters, though Graffin wrote the bulk of the material on his own for a three-album period in the late 1990s. Gurewitz had left the band in 1994 to concentrate on the future of Epitaph.

After a stint with major label Atlantic Records ended in the early 2000s, Bad Religion re-signed with Epitaph and Gurewitz rejoined. They have since continued to co-write songs and recorded six records: &quot;The Process of Belief&quot; (2002), &quot;The Empire Strikes First&quot; (2004), &quot;New Maps of Hell&quot; (2007), &quot;The Dissent of Man&quot; (2010), &quot;True North&quot; (2013), and their latest, &quot;Age of Unreason&quot; (2019)

===Solo career===
Graffin recorded a solo album in 1997, called &quot;American Lesion&quot;, which consisted of softer, more pop-oriented folk songs. Most of this album was written during the breakup of his marriage, and the songs reflect this in lyrics and style.

In 2005, Graffin recorded his second solo album, &quot;Cold as the Clay.&quot; The album is an amalgamation of new songs by Graffin and 18th- and 19th-century American folk songs. It was produced by Brett Gurewitz and released via ANTI- on July 10, 2006.

In a September 2015 interview, Graffin revealed that he had been working on his third solo album, on which he planned to continue the folk style of &quot;Cold as the Clay&quot;. That record, &quot;Millport&quot;, was released on March 10, 2017. It was co-written and produced by Gurewitz and features members of Social Distortion as backing musicians.

==Academics==
Graffin attended El Camino Real High School, then obtained both his BA Biology, BS Geology and master&#x27;s in Geology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). In 2003 he went on to earn his PhD in Zoology from Cornell University.The PhD dissertation was supervised by William B. Provine. After years of being out-of-print, the title of his dissertation changed to &quot;Evolution and Religion: Questioning the Beliefs of the World&#x27;s Eminent Evolutionists&quot;.

Graffin returned to UCLA where he taught natural science courses. In a June 2008 interview with Bad Religion bassist Jay Bentley, he mentioned that Graffin would be teaching there from January to March 2009. In April 2011, Graffin revealed that he would return to Cornell University that fall to co-teach for 14 weeks.

In 2011 the new type species &quot;Qiliania graffini&quot; of an extinct bird from the lower Cretaceous was named after Graffin &quot;for his contributions to evolutionary biology, his public out-reach through music, and his inspiration to young scientists around the world&quot;.

===Work as an author and educator===
Graffin received the Rushdie Award for Cultural Humanism from the Harvard Humanist Chaplaincy in 2008. 

Throughout 2003, Graffin was engaged in an ongoing email discussion with Preston Jones, a historian at the Christian John Brown University in Arkansas and fan of Bad Religion. The informal philosophical debate that resulted was published as a book titled &quot;Is Belief in God Good, Bad or Irrelevant? A Professor and Punk Rocker Discuss Science, Religion, Naturalism &amp; Christianity&quot; in 2006.

In 2009, Graffin announced that he had co-written a book with American author Steve Olson titled &quot;Anarchy Evolution&quot;, released on September 28, 2010 (the same day his band Bad Religion released their 15th album &quot;The Dissent of Man&quot;). In his book, Graffin writes that he is an atheist: &quot;I&#x27;ve never believed in God, which technically makes me an atheist&quot;. Although Graffin is not religious, he prefers to identify as a naturalist rather than as an atheist. &quot;Naturalism is a belief system. A lot of scientists bristle at that. We all have to believe we can find the truth. Evidence is my guide. I rely on observation, experimentation and verification.&quot; He also filmed and co-produced a television pilot called &quot;Punk Professor&quot;.

In 2010, he commented on the project, &quot;It&#x27;s sitting on someone&#x27;s shelf waiting to be developed. I&#x27;m not actually pursuing it. I said, yeah, I&#x27;ll shoot the pilot, then it&#x27;s out of my hands.&quot;

On March 24, 2012, Bad Religion headlined the Reason Rally in Washington, D.C., where Graffin performed the U.S. national anthem.

Another book entitled &quot;Population Wars&quot; was released in September 2015. It had been in the works since at least April 2011 and Graffin spoke about it to be &quot;a bit more in depth about the process of evolution&quot;. In a November 2015 interview with &quot;PopMatters&quot; journalist J.C. Maçek III for Graffin&#x27;s book &quot;Population Wars&quot;, Graffin stated &quot;I&#x27;ve made a lot of mistakes, but you can&#x27;t dwell on mistakes because life is about an adventure. It&#x27;s about discovery. And you learn from your mistakes so unless you&#x27;re completely shut down to improving your life, I believe you can continue learning until you&#x27;re very, very old. You have to look at those past missteps as learning experiences.&quot;

<text>Saipan () is the largest island and capital of the Northern Mariana Islands, an unincorporated territory of the United States in the western Pacific Ocean. According to 2020 estimates by the United States Census Bureau, the population of Saipan was 43,385. Its people have been United States citizens since the 1980s. Saipan is one of the main homes of the Chamorro, the indigenous people of the Mariana Islands. 

Saipan has been inhabited for over four thousand years. From the 17th century, the island experienced Spanish occupation and rule until the Spanish–American War of 1898, when Saipan was briefly occupied by the United States, before being formally sold to Germany. About 15 years of German rule were followed by 30 years of Japanese rule, which was ended by the Battle of Saipan, as the United States began to take control of the Philippine Sea. Following World War II, Saipan became part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and was administered by the United States, along with rest of the Northern Marianas. In 1978, Saipan formally joined the United States as part of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

Today, Saipan is home to about 90% of the population of the Northern Mariana Islands. It hosts many resorts, golf courses, beaches, nature sites, and WW2 historical sites. The legislative and executive branches of Commonwealth government are located in the village of Capitol Hill on the island while the judicial branch is headquartered in the village of Susupe. Since the entire island is organized as a single municipality, most publications designate Saipan as the Commonwealth&#x27;s capital. As of 2023, Saipan&#x27;s mayor is Ramon Camacho and the governor of the Northern Mariana Islands is Arnold Palacios.

Saipan was hit by Typhoon Yutu in 2018, which caused widespread damage.

== Etymology ==
In the Chamorro language, the island is called &quot;&quot;. Carolinian people who wished to claim prior inhabitance of the island have asserted that the name derives from the Carolinian word (literal meaning, &quot;a voyage empty&quot;), in reference to a legendary Carolinian voyage of discovery of the primordial island.

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
Traces of human settlements on Saipan have been found by archaeologists ranging over 4,000 years, including petroglyphs, ancient Latte Stones, and other artifacts pointing to cultural affinities with Melanesia and with similar stone monuments in Micronesia and Palau.

=== Spanish colonial period ===
Saipan, together with Tinian, was possibly first sighted by Europeans during the Spanish expedition of Ferdinand Magellan, when it made a landing in the southern Marianas on March 6, 1521. It is likely Saipan was sighted by Gonzalo Gómez de Espinosa in 1522 on board of Spanish ship &quot;Trinidad&quot;, which he commanded after the death of Ferdinand Magellan who died in the Battle of Mactan in Cebu, Philippines. This is likely to have occurred after the sighting of the Maug Islands between the end of August and the end of September 1522.

Gonzalo de Vigo deserted in the Maugs from Gómez de Espinosa&#x27;s &quot;Trinidad&quot; and during the next four years, living with the local indigenous Chamorro people, visited thirteen main islands in the Marianas and possibly Saipan among them. The first clear evidence of Europeans arriving to Saipan was by the Manila galleon &quot;Santa Margarita&quot; commanded by Juan Martínez de Guillistegui, that wrecked on the island in February 1600 and whose survivors stayed on it for two years, until 250 were rescued by the &quot;Santo Tomás&quot; and the &quot;Jesús María&quot;.

The Spanish formally occupied the island in 1668, with the missionary expedition of Diego Luis de San Vitores who named it &quot;San José&quot;. After 1670, it became a port of call for Portuguese, Spanish, occasional English, Dutch and French ships as a supply station for food and water. The native population shrank dramatically due to European-introduced diseases and conflicts over land. The Chamorros were forcibly relocated to Guam fearing the spread of leprosy in 1720 for better control and assimilation. Under Spanish rule, the island was developed into ranches for raising cattle and pigs, which were used as provision for Spanish galleons originating from the Philippines on their way to Mexico and vice versa.

Around 1815, many Carolinians from Satawal settled Saipan during a period when the Chamorros were imprisoned on Guam, which resulted in a significant loss of land and rights for the Chamorro natives. The Caroline Islands had suffered a devastating typhoon that destroyed their crops. The leader of this company was an individual named &quot;Chief Aghurubw,&quot; who sailed to Guam to ask the Spanish governor permission to settle on the islands. The Spaniards allowed Chief Aghurubw to settle on the island of Saipan. The Marianas archipelago was under the protectorate of the Spanish General Government of the Philippines; the Civil Guard and soldiers of the city of Macabebe in the Province of Pampanga frequently made port calls to the islands to ensure law and order.

=== German colonial period ===
After the Spanish–American War of 1898, Saipan was occupied by the United States. However, it was then sold by Spain to the German Empire under the terms of the German–Spanish Treaty of 1899.

The island was administered by Germany as part of German New Guinea, but during the German period, there was no attempt to develop or settle the island, which remained under the control of its Spanish and mestizo landowners.

=== Japanese colonial period ===

In 1914, during World War I, the island was captured by the Empire of Japan. Japan was awarded formal control of the island in 1919 by the League of Nations as a part of its mandated territory of the South Seas Mandate. Militarily and economically, Saipan was one of the most important islands in the mandate and became the center of subsequent Japanese settlement. Immigration began in the 1920s by ethnic Japanese, Koreans, Taiwanese and Okinawans, who developed large-scale sugar plantations. The South Seas Development Company built sugar refineries and—under Japanese rule—extensive infrastructure development occurred, including the construction of port facilities, waterworks, power stations, paved roads and schools, along with entertainment facilities and Shinto shrines. By October 1943, Saipan had a civilian population of 29,348 Japanese settlers and 3,926 Chamorro and Carolinian Islanders.

=== World War II ===


Japan considered Saipan to be part of the last line of defenses for the Japanese homeland, and thus had strongly committed to defending it. The Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy garrisoned Saipan heavily from the late 1930s, building numerous coastal artillery batteries, shore defenses, underground fortifications and an airstrip. In mid-1944, nearly 30,000 troops were based on the island.

The Battle of Saipan, from June 15 to July 9, 1944, was one of the major campaigns of World War II. The United States Marine Corps and United States Army landed on the beaches of the south-western side of the island and, after more than three weeks in heavy fighting, captured the island from the Japanese. The battle cost the Americans 3,426 killed and 10,364 wounded.

Of the estimated 30,000 Japanese defenders, only 921 were taken prisoner. The weapons used, and the tactics of close quarter fighting, also resulted in high civilian casualties. Some 20,000 Japanese civilians perished during the battle, including over 1,000 who jumped from &quot;Suicide Cliff&quot; and &quot;Banzai Cliff&quot; rather than be caught and taken prisoner.

Seabees of the U.S. Navy also landed, to initiate construction projects. With the capture of Saipan, the American military was only 
from the Japanese home islands, which placed most Japanese cities within striking distance of United States&#x27; B-29 Superfortress bombers. The loss of Saipan was a heavy blow to both the military and civilian administration of Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tōjō, who was forced to resign.

The wartime history is interpreted on Saipan at American Memorial Park and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Museum of History and Culture. After the war, nearly all of the surviving Japanese settlers were repatriated to Japan.

=== U.N. trust territory ===
After World War II, Saipan became part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, administered by the United States. 

The U.S. bases on Saipan closed or were converted to other purposes, for example the Naval Advance Base Saipan from 1962 to 1986 was the headquarters for the U.N Trusteeship. East Field airbase was used as an airport until the 1960s, after its military use ended in 1946. Later on the area was made into a golf course.

===United States commonwealth===

The Northern Mariana islanders voted to join the United States in 1975, and the island became a municipality of the newly-formed Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in 1978. On November 4, 1986, the islanders of the Northern Marianas including Saipan became United States citizens and the Northern Marianas formally became a part of the United States of America. This meant that U.S. citizens could visit or live in Saipan and the rest of the CNMI without a passport and vice versa.

== Geography ==

Saipan is the largest island in the Northern Mariana Islands. It is about north of Guam and northeast of Tinian, from which it is separated by the Saipan Channel. Saipan is about long and wide, with a land area of .

The western side of the island is lined with sandy beaches and an offshore coral reef creates a large lagoon. The eastern shore is composed primarily of rugged rocky cliffs and a reef. A narrow underwater bank of Marpi Reef lies north of the Saipan, and CK Reef lies in the west of the island.
The highest elevation on Saipan is a limestone-covered mountain called Mount Tapochau at . Unlike many of the mountains in the Mariana Islands, it is not an extinct volcano but is a limestone formation.

To the north of Mount Tapochau towards Banzai Cliff, is a ridge of hills. Mount Achugao, situated about 2 miles north, has been interpreted to be a remnant of a stratified composite volcanic cone whose Eocene center was not far north of the present peak.

Saipan has some additional semi-attached islets, one of which being Bird Island, which is a nature reserve for birds. It is connected to Saipan only at low tide. Forbidden Island is similar, but larger on the south east side of Saipan.
Mañagaha is a small 100 acre island off the west coast, and is a popular tourist destination. Access is by ferry, which is about ten minutes from the mainland.

An underwater limestone cavern called the Grotto, is up to 20 meters (70 feet) deep.

=== Ecology ===
Several wildlife conservations areas have been designated on Saipan: Bird Island Wildlife Conservation Area, Kagman Wildlife Conservation Area, Lake Susupe Conservation Area, Megapode Conservation Areas, Saipan Upland Mitigation Bank, and the Costco Park Wetland Mitigation Pond.

==== Flora ====
The flora of Saipan is predominantly limestone forest. Some developed areas on the island are covered with &quot;Leucaena leucocephala&quot;, also known as &quot;tangan-tangan&quot; trees, which were spread broadly sometime after World War II. Tangan-Tangan trees were introduced, primarily, as an erosion-prevention mechanism, due to the decimation of the landscape brought on by World War II. Remaining native forest occurs in small, isolated fragments on steep slopes at low elevations and highland conservation areas of the island. 

Coconuts, papayas, and Thai hot peppers – locally called &quot;donni&#x27; såli&quot; or &quot;boonie peppers&quot; – are among the fruits that grow wild. Mangoes, taro root, breadfruit (locally called &quot;Lemai&quot;), and bananas are a few of the many foods cultivated by local families and farmers.

==== Fauna ====

Saipan is home to numerous endemic bird species, including the Mariana fruit dove, white-throated ground dove, bridled white-eye, golden white-eye, Micronesian myzomela and the endangered Saipan reed warbler. Multiple areas on Saipan, including the Sabana, Bird Island, Mount Topachau, Susupe, and Kagman, have been recognized as Important Bird Areas (IBA) by BirdLife International because they provide habitat for many different bird species.

The island used to have a large population of giant African land snails, introduced either deliberately as a food source, or accidentally by shipping, which became an agricultural pest. In the last few decades, its numbers have been substantially controlled by an introduced flatworm, &quot;Platydemus manokwari&quot;.

=== Climate ===
Saipan has a borderline tropical rainforest climate (Köppen &quot;Af&quot;)/tropical monsoon climate (Köppen &quot;Am&quot;), moderated by seasonal trade winds from the northeast from November to March, and easterly winds from May to October. Average year-round maximum temperature is . There is little seasonal temperature variation, and Saipan has been cited by the Guinness Book of World Records as having the least fluctuating temperatures in the world. However, the temperature is affected by elevation; hence, the island shows considerable variations between the coastal and mountainous areas.

The drier season runs from December to June and the rainier season from July to November. Typhoon season runs from July to December, and Saipan, along with the rest of the Mariana Islands, is subject to at least one typhoon each year.

== Music ==
Music on Saipan can generally be broken down into three categories: local, mainland American, and Asian. Local consists of Chamorro, Carolinian, Micronesian Hawaiian Reggae and Palauan music, often with traditional dance for many occasions. Mainland American consists of much of the same music that can be found on U.S. radio. Asian consists of Japanese, Korean, Thai and Philippine music, among others. There are seven radio stations on Saipan, which play mainly popular and classic English-language songs as well as local and Philippine music.

In 2017, an album called &quot;Music Of The Marianas: Made In Saipan Vol.1&quot;, featured 20 songs from a diverse collection of CNMI artists, released by 11th World Productions. The CD features artists ranging from Church choral works, to mellow acoustic works, and underground island hip-hop.

== Television ==
Local television stations on Saipan are the following:
* KPPI-LP (ABC7), the ABC affiliate (simulcasts KTGM), which is owned by Sorensen Media Group.
* KSPN 2, which is owned by the Flame Tree Network.
* The Visitors Channel 3, which is owned by the Flame Tree Network.
* WSZE-TV 10, the NBC affiliate (repeats KUAM-TV in Guam), which is owned by Pacific Telestations.

== Transportation ==

Travel to and from the island is available from nine international airlines via Saipan International Airport. A small airline based on Tinian flies small twins to the islands of the Northern Marianas, typically short flights from island to island and Guam. A ferry once operated between Saipan and Tinian but was halted in 2010, reportedly for maintenance, and was never reinstated.

One of the island&#x27;s two main thoroughfares, Beach Road, is located on the western coast of Saipan. At some parts of the road, the beach is only a few feet away. Flame trees and pine trees line the street. The street also connects more than six villages that lie on the western coast of the island. Middle Road is the island&#x27;s largest road and runs through its central section. Like Beach Road, Middle Road connects several villages throughout the island. Several offices, shops, hotels, and residences lie on or nearby these highways. Middle Road is labeled &quot;Chalan Pale Arnold&quot; on maps, but very few people call it that. Aside from school buses, there is little to no public transportation on Saipan. Cars are the transportation of choice with motorcycles being the only other truly viable transportation method while bicycles are only viable in certain areas. Proper sidewalks are uncommon on the island with the majority located in Garapan and several at the corner turns of stoplights.

== Villages and towns ==

The island of Saipan has a total of 30 &quot;official&quot; villages. However, there are many sub-areas and neighborhoods located in certain villages such as &quot;Afetnas&quot; in San Antonio and &quot;Tapochau&quot; and &quot;I Denne&quot; in Capitol Hill. Those marked &quot;SV:&quot; are the sub-villages.
==Tourism==

Noted tourist destinations on Saipan include Managaha Island (100 acre tropical beach island visited by ferry), American Memorial Park and Micro Beach, a 1 km beach on the west side, making it possible to see the sun set., Latte Stones (old stones structures from the island&#x27;s past), Mount Tapochau (highest point with views of Saipan), this site is known for its views and its possible to see other islands on clear day and is topped by a statue of Jesus Christ. Last Command Post (War history site of a Japanese command post in the WW2 Battle of Saipan), Bird Island Sanctuary beach (beach by Bird Island sanctuary), faces east. There is also a Bird Island observatory to the south for observing the birds), Forbidden Island, a small island that is connected to Saipan at low tide and can be hiked onto, but at high tide the water separates the two. The island also features a lookout., Japanese Lighthouse (a lighthouse built in 1934 when the Northern Marianas were in the Japanese Mandate, currently a cafe with island views), NMI Museum of History and Culture, and The Grotto, a large underwater limestone cavern.

== Economy ==

Tourism had traditionally been a vital source of the island&#x27;s revenue and economic activities. But in the 1980s, garment manufacturing became one of the main economic driving forces in Saipan when the U.S. government agreed that the CNMI would be exempted from certain federal minimum wage and immigration laws. While one result of these changes was an increase in hotels and tourism, the main consequence was that dozens of garment factories opened and clothing manufacturing became the island&#x27;s chief economic force, employing thousands of foreign contract laborers (mostly young Chinese women) at low wages. The manufacturers could legally label these low cost garments &quot;Made in the U.S.A.&quot; and the clothing shipped to the U.S. market was also exempt from U.S. tariffs. By 1998, the island&#x27;s garment industry exported close to $1 billion worth of apparel products to the mainland. The working conditions and treatment experienced by employees in these factories were the subject of controversy and criticism.

When the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) expired in 2005, thus eliminating quotas on textile exports to the United States, Saipan&#x27;s garment factories started closing one after another. From a high of 34 garment factories in the late 1990s, By March 2007, 19 companies manufactured garments on Saipan. In addition to many foreign-owned and run companies, many well-known U.S. brands also operated garment factories in Saipan for much of the last three decades. Brands included Gap, Levi Strauss, Phillips-Van Heusen, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, L&#x27;Oreal subsidiary Ralph Lauren (Polo), Lord &amp; Taylor, Tommy Hilfiger, and Walmart. By January 15, 2009, the island&#x27;s last garment factory shuttered their doors. On November 28, 2009, the federal government took control of immigration to the Northern Mariana Islands.

More recently, casino gaming has come to Saipan with at least five casinos now operating on the island. As of 2016, Imperial Pacific International Holdings, a Chinese company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (but majority owned by billionaire businesswoman Cui Lijie), which develops and operates casinos, hotels, and restaurants in CNMI, was reportedly the largest taxpayer in Saipan. In 2014, Imperial Pacific was granted a 25-year license to build and operate casinos on Saipan with an option to extend the license for another 15 years. The Imperial Pacific Resort, still unfinished as of June 2019, is set to include a luxury hotel, casino, restaurants, retail space, and leisure facilities. The complex was supposed to be completed by August 2018. The existing casinos are already handling over $2 billion monthly in VIP bets, more than the largest casinos in Macau, leading to accusations of money laundering. There has been criticism by local doctors after dead and seriously injured Chinese workers have appeared at the hospital, often illegally working under tourist visas.

== Labor controversies ==

=== Jack Abramoff CNMI scandal ===

Jack Abramoff and his law firm were paid at least $6.7 million by the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) from 1995 to 2001 to change and/or prevent Congressional action regarding the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and businesses on Saipan, its capital, commercial center, and one of its three principal islands.

Later lobbying efforts involved mailings from a Ralph Reed marketing company and bribery of Roger Stillwell, a Department of the Interior official who in 2006 pleaded guilty to accepting gifts from Abramoff.

=== Foreign contract labor abuse and exemptions from U.S. federal regulations ===

Excerpted from &quot;Immigration and the CNMI: A report of the US Commission on Immigration Reform&quot;, January 7, 1998:
On March 31, 1998, US Senator Daniel Akaka said:
In 1991, Levi Strauss &amp; Co. was embarrassed by a scandal involving six subsidiary factories run on Saipan by the Tan Holdings Corporation. It was revealed that Chinese laborers in those factories suffered under what the U.S. Department of Labor called &quot;slavelike&quot; conditions. Cited for sub-minimal wages, seven-day work week schedules with twelve-hour shifts, poor living conditions and other indignities (including the alleged removal of passports and the virtual imprisonment of workers), Tan would eventually pay what was then the largest fines in U.S. labor history, distributing more than $9 million in restitution to some 1200 employees. At the time, Tan factories produced 3% of Levi&#x27;s jeans with the &quot;Made in the U.S.A.&quot; label. Levi Strauss claimed that it had no knowledge of the offenses, severed ties to the Tan family, and instituted labor reforms and inspection practices in its offshore facilities.

In 1999, Sweatshop Watch, Global Exchange, Asian Law Caucus, Unite, and the garment workers themselves filed three separate lawsuits in class-action suits on behalf of roughly 30,000 garment workers in Saipan. The defendants included 27 U.S. retailers and 23 Saipan garment factories. By 2004, they had won a 20 million dollar settlement against all but one of the defendants. Levi Strauss &amp; Co. was the only successful defendant, winning the case against them in 2004.

In 2005–2006, the issue of immigration and labor practices on Saipan was brought up during the American political scandals of Congressman Tom DeLay and lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who visited the island on numerous occasions. &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine published an exposé in their Spring 2006 article &quot;Paradise Lost: Greed, Sex Slavery, Forced Abortion and Right-Wing Moralists&quot;.

On February 8, 2007, the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources received testimony about federalizing CNMI labor and immigration.

On July 19, 2007, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Insular Affairs David B. Cohen testified before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources Regarding S. 1634 (The Northern Mariana Islands Covenant Implementation Act). He said:

A movement to federalize labor and immigration in the Northern Marianas Islands began in early 2007. A letter writing campaign to reform CNMI labor and immigration was debated in the local newspapers. Worker groups organized a successful Unity March December 7, 2007. Despite a strong lobby effort by Governor Fitial to stop it, President Bush signed PL 110-229 into law on May 8, 2008, and the U.S. immigration takeover began November 28, 2009.

Contract laborers arriving from China are usually required to pay their (Chinese National) recruitment agents fees equal to a year&#x27;s total salary (roughly $3,500) and occasionally as high as two years&#x27; salary, though the contracts are only one-year contracts, renewable at the employer&#x27;s discretion.

Sixty percent of the population of the CNMI is contract workers. These workers cannot vote. They are not represented, and can be deported if they lose their jobs. Meanwhile, the minimum wage remains well below that on the U.S. mainland, and abuses of vulnerable workers are commonplace.

In John Bowe&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;Nobodies: Modern American Slave Labor and the Dark Side of the New Global Economy&quot;, he provides a focus on Saipan, exploring how its culture, isolation and American ties have made it a favorable environment for exploitative garment manufacturers and corrupt politicos. Bowe goes into detail about the island&#x27;s factories, and also its karaoke bars and strip joints, some of which have had connections with politicos. The author depicts Saipan as a vulnerable, truly suffering community, where poverty rates have climbed as high as 35 percent, and proposes that the guest worker setup, by allowing many native islanders to avoid work, has actually crippled the competitiveness and job readiness of the native population.

Chinese national, Chun Yu Wang, in her 2009 book, &quot;Chicken Feathers and Garlic Skin: Diary of a Chinese Garment Factory Girl on Saipan&quot; (as told to Walt F.J. Goodridge), provides the only known first-hand account of factory work conditions and life in the barracks, a historical timeline of the garment factory era on Saipan, and provides revealing insights from a Chinese perspective into the experience typical of many of the garment factory workers on Saipan.

=== Imperial Pacific Holdings Casino ===
On March 23, 2017, one of Imperial Pacific&#x27;s Chinese construction workers fell off a scaffold and died. This led the Federal Bureau of Investigation to search one of Imperial Pacific&#x27;s offices and make an arrest. On February 15, 2018, &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; published an investigative report on the circumstances surrounding the death of this construction worker. An attorney for the Torres Brothers law firm which represented this worker said the report omitted several facts about the case. Imperial Pacific disputed all allegations of wrongdoing and sued Bloomberg for defamation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Department of Homeland Security investigated the case and charged five individuals with harboring undocumented workers. Companies linked to the governing Torres family have close links to the corporation, receiving $126,000 in 2017.

== Other local issues ==
Despite an annual rainfall of , the Commonwealth Utilities Corporation (CUC), the local government-run water utility company on Saipan, is unable to deliver 24-hour-a-day potable water to its customers in certain areas. As a result, several large hotels use reverse osmosis to produce fresh water for their customers. In addition, many homes and small businesses augment the sporadic and sometimes brackish water provided by CUC with rainwater collected and stored in cisterns. Most locals buy drinking water from water distributors and use tap water only for bathing or washing as it has a strong sulfur taste.

On October 18, 2018, Typhoon Yutu, the second strongest typhoon to have ever made impact on U.S. territory, made landfall on Saipan. With sustained winds of 130 mph and gusts up to 190 mph, it caused significant damage.

== Demographics ==

According to the 2010 United States Census, Saipan&#x27;s population was 48,220, a drop of 22.7% from the 2000 US Census; the population decrease is largely attributed to working immigrants and their families either returning to their home countries after the collapse of the garment industry or moving to other locations with economic opportunities such as Guam and the United States mainland. The population of Saipan corresponds to approximately 90% of the population of the Northern Mariana Islands.

Large numbers of Filipino, Chinese, Bangladeshi, Nepalese and smaller numbers of Sri Lankan and Burmese unskilled workers and professionals migrated to the Northern Mariana Islands including Saipan during the late 1900s, mostly during the 1980s and 1990s. In addition, a large percentage of the island&#x27;s population includes first-generation immigrants and their descendants from Japan, China, Korea, the Philippines, Bangladesh and immigrants from other Micronesian islands.

According to the 2010 United States Census, Saipan was 50.9% Asian (35.3% Filipino, 6.8% Chinese, 4.2% Korean, 1.5% Japanese, 0.9% Bangladeshi, 0.5% Thai, 0.4% Nepalese, 0.3% Other Asian), 34.9% Pacific Islander (23.9% Chamorro, 4.6% Carolinian, 2.3% Chuukese, 2.2% Palauan, 0.8% Pohnpeian, 0.4% Yapese, 0.1% Kosraean, 0.1% Marshallese, and 0.5% Other Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander), 2.1% White and 0.2% others.

== Religion ==

The majority of the native Chamorro and Carolinian population are Roman Catholic. About half of the general population on the island are foreign contract workers, mainly Catholics of Filipino descent.

Numerous Christian churches are active in Saipan, providing services in various languages including English, Chamorro, Tagalog, Korean and Chinese.

In conjunction to the rest of the Northern Mariana Islands, there are Chinese and Filipino Protestant and Catholic churches, a Korean Protestant church, three mosques for the Bangladeshi community and a Buddhist temple.

The 1960 movie &quot;Hell to Eternity&quot; tells the true-life story of GI Guy Gabaldon&#x27;s role in convincing 800 Japanese soldiers to surrender during the WWII Battle of Saipan. Key to Gabaldon&#x27;s success was his ability to speak Japanese fluently due to having been raised in the 1930s by a Japanese-American foster family.

Much of the action in the 2002 film &quot;Windtalkers&quot; takes place during the invasion of Saipan during World War II.

In 2011, a Japanese film about Captain Sakae Ōba took place in Saipan. Titled&quot; &quot;, it revolved around Oba holding out on Saipan until December 1, 1945.

A significant part of the novel &quot;Amrita&quot; by Japanese author Banana Yoshimoto takes place in Saipan with regular references to the landscape and spirituality of the island.

Saipan is the setting for the P. F. Kluge novel &quot;The Master Blaster&quot;. This novel is structured as first-person narratives of five characters, four of whom arrive on the same flight, and the unfolding of their experiences on the island. The book weaves together a mysterious tale of historical fiction with reference to Saipan&#x27;s multi-ethnic past, from Japanese colonization to American WWII victory and the post-Cold War evolution of the island. The Master Blaster is the home-grown anonymous critic who blogs about the corruption and exploitation by developers, politicians, and government officials.

Saipan is known in the association football community as the site of the training camp for the Republic of Ireland national football team prior to the 2002 FIFA World Cup in which an incident of heated argument occurred between then-captain Roy Keane and then-manager Mick McCarthy, which eventually led to the dismissal and departure of Keane from the squad. This incident has come to be known colloquially as &quot;the Saipan incident&quot; or &quot;the Saipan saga&quot;.

In 2016, a horror film directed by Hiroshi Katagiri was released on Netflix titled &quot;&quot; in which American developers encounter a supernatural entity in a World War 2 hidden bunker while searching for land to build their resort.

In 2024, Julian Assange visited briefly to plead guilty in the federal courthouse of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands, located in Saipan, to conspiracy to obtain and disclose US national defense information.

<text>USS &quot;Duluth&quot; was a light cruiser of the United States Navy, which were built during World War II. The class was designed as a development of the earlier s, the size of which had been limited by the First London Naval Treaty. The start of the war led to the dissolution of the treaty system, but the dramatic need for new vessels precluded a new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s used the same hull as their predecessors, but were significantly heavier. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;s carried a main battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, along with a secondary armament of twelve  dual-purpose guns. They had a top speed of .

She was launched 13 January 1944 by Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company, Newport News, Virginia; sponsored by Mrs. E. H. Hatch, wife of the Mayor of Duluth, Minnesota; and commissioned 18 September 1944, Captain Donald Roderick Osborn, Jr., US Naval Academy class of 1920, in command.

==Design==

The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers traced their origin to design work done in the late 1930s; at the time, light cruiser displacement was limited to by the Second London Naval Treaty. Following the start of World War II in September 1939, Britain announced it would suspend the treaty for the duration of the conflict, a decision the US Navy quickly followed. Though still neutral, the United States recognized that war was likely and the urgent need for additional ships ruled out an entirely new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s were a close development of the earlier s, the chief difference being the substitution of a two-gun dual-purpose gun mount for one of the main battery gun turrets.

&quot;Duluth&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . Her crew numbered 1285 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 6 in /47-caliber Mark 16 guns in four 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Two were placed forward in a superfiring pair; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of twelve /38-caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets. Two of these were placed on the centerline, one directly behind the forward main turrets and the other just forward of the aft turrets. Two more were placed abreast of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense consisted of twenty-eight Bofors guns in four quadruple and six double mounts and ten Oerlikon guns in single mounts.

The ship&#x27;s belt armor ranged in thickness from , with the thicker section amidships where it protected the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. Her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and sides and tops, and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;Duluth&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

==Service history==
===Construction and World War II===
The keel for &quot;Duluth&quot; was laid down in November 1942 at the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia, with the hull number CL-87. Her completed hull was launched on 13 January 1944, and fitting-out work was completed by September. The ship was commissioned on 18 September and thereafter began sea trials. &quot;Duluth&quot; operated as a training cruiser based in Newport, Rhode Island, from 14 December to 2 March 1945 as her crew familiarized themselves with the ship. She thereafter steamed to Norfolk, Virginia, for a short refit. On 7 April, &quot;Duluth&quot; got underway to join the war effort in the Pacific. After transiting the Panama Canal, she arrived in Pearl Harbor on 29 April.

&quot;Duluth&quot; left Pearl Harbor on 8 May to join 5th Fleet, which she met on 27 May. While cruising with the fleet off Okinawa on 5 June, &quot;Duluth&quot; was damaged by a severe typhoon, along with a number of other vessels. She had to sail south to Guam for repairs, which lasted for more than a month. She returned to the Fast Carrier Task Force on 21 July, which had by that time passed to 3rd Fleet, being renamed Task Force 38. &quot;Duluth&quot; was assigned to the subordinate unit Task Group 38.1, along with five aircraft carriers, three fast battleships, four other cruisers, and several destroyers. She served as part of the anti-aircraft screen that protected the carriers as they carried out a series of air strikes on various targets in Japan. These operations continued until the end of the war on 14 August.

During this period, on 18 July, &quot;Duluth&quot; was temporarily transferred to Task Group 35.4, along with the cruisers , , and and eight destroyers. The unit carried out a sweep for Japanese coastal shipping that night, but failed to locate any significant targets. &quot;Duluth&quot; thereafter returned to TG 38.1 and remained with it for the next month during the initial occupation operations. The ships entered Sagami Bay on 27 August with the rest of TF 38 to begin preparations for the formal surrender of Japan, which took place aboard the battleship on 2 September. &quot;Duluth&quot; moved to Tokyo Bay on 16 September as part of the occupation effort. The ship got underway on 1 October to return home, arriving in Seattle, Washington, on 19 October, where she took part in Navy Day celebrations. The ship received two battle stars during her brief service during the war.

===Postwar career===
The ship was thereafter based in San Pedro, California, and was sent on a deployment to East Asian waters that lasted from 3 January 1946 to 27 September. The ship sailed to Pearl Harbor on 24 February 1947 for a lengthy visit to the port. &quot;Duluth&quot; went on a major cruise to the southern and western Pacific between May and July. During the voyage, she visited Melbourne and Sydney, Australia; Truk and Guam in the central Pacific, and Manila in the Philippines. During the latter visit, &quot;Duluth&quot; cruised with the aircraft carrier and a division of destroyers, and it was timed for the first anniversary of the Philippines&#x27; independence.

The ship was then sent to the coast of China to patrol the region during the Chinese Civil War. Her deployment lasted from 22 September 1947 to 19 May 1948, which concluded with the transfer of &quot;Duluth&quot; to Long Beach, California, where she was based for the remainder of her career. In mid-1948, she embarked on a training cruise for NROTC midshipmen that included a visit to British Columbia. The ship took part in cold-weather training exercises held off Kodiak, Alaska, in February 1949, before being decommissioned on 25 June and assigned to the reserve fleet. She remained there for more than a decade, before being sold to ship breakers on 14 November 1960.

<text>The Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) is a species of eagle-owl, a type of bird that resides in much of Eurasia. It is often just called the eagle-owl in Europe and Asia.

It is one of the largest species of owl. Females can grow to a total length of , with a wingspan of . Males are slightly smaller. This bird has distinctive ear tufts, with upper parts that are mottled with darker blackish colouring and tawny. The wings and tail are barred. The underparts are a variably hued buff, streaked with darker colouring. The facial disc is not very defined. The orange eyes are distinctive. At least 12 subspecies of the Eurasian eagle-owl are described.

Eurasian eagle-owls are found in many habitats; mostly mountainous and rocky areas, often near varied woodland edge and near shrubby areas with openings or wetlands. They also inhabit coniferous forests, steppes, and remote areas. Occasionally, they are found in farmland and in park-like settings in European and Asian cities and, very rarely, in busier urban areas.

The eagle-owl is mostly a nocturnal predator. Predominantly, they hunt small mammals, such as rodents and rabbits, but also birds and larger mammals. Secondary prey include reptiles, amphibians, fish, large insects, and invertebrates.

The species typically breeds on cliff ledges, in gullies, among rocks, and in other concealed locations. The nest is a scrape containing a clutch of 2–4 eggs typically, which are laid at intervals and hatch at different times. The female incubates the eggs and broods the young. The male brings food for her and for the nestlings. Continuing parental care for the young is provided by both adults for about five months.

In addition to being one of the largest living species of owl, the Eurasian eagle-owl is also one of the most widely distributed. With a total range in Europe and Asia of about and a total population estimated to be between 100,000 and 500,000 individuals, the IUCN lists the bird&#x27;s conservation status as being of least concern, although the trend is listed as decreasing. The vast majority of eagle-owls live in Continental Europe, Scandinavia, Russia (which is almost certainly where the peak numbers and diversity of race occurs), and Central Asia. Additional minor populations exist in Anatolia, the northern Middle East, the montane upper part of South Asia, China, Korea and in Japan; in addition, an estimated 12 to 40 pairs are thought to reside in the United Kingdom as of 2016 (where they are arguably non-native), a number which may be on the rise, and have successfully bred in the UK since at least 1996. Tame eagle-owls have occasionally been used in pest control because of their size to deter large birds such as gulls from nesting.

==Description==
The Eurasian eagle-owl is among the larger birds of prey, smaller than the golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;), but larger than the snowy owl (&quot;Bubo scandiacus&quot;), despite some overlap in size with both of those species. It is sometimes referred to as the world&#x27;s largest owl, although Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl (&quot;B. blakistoni&quot;) is slightly heavier on average and the much lighter weight great grey owl (&quot;Strix nebulosa&quot;) is slightly longer on average. Heimo Mikkola reported the largest specimens of eagle-owl as having the same upper body mass, , as the largest Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl and attained a length around longer. In terms of average weight and wing size, the Blakiston&#x27;s is the slightly larger species seemingly, even averaging a bit larger in these aspects than the biggest eagle-owl races from Russia. Also, although shorter than the largest of the latter species, the Eurasian eagle-owl can weigh well more than twice as much as the largest great grey owl. The Eurasian eagle-owl typically has a wingspan of , with the largest specimens possibly attaining . The total length of the species can vary from . Females can weigh from , and males can weigh from . In comparison, the barn owl (&quot;Tyto alba&quot;), the world&#x27;s most widely distributed owl species, weighs about and the great horned owl (&quot;B. virginianus&quot;), which fills the eagle-owl&#x27;s ecological niche in North America, weighs around .

Besides the female being larger, little external sexual dimorphism is seen in the Eurasian eagle-owl, although the ear tufts of males reportedly tend to be more upright than those of females. When an eagle-owl is seen on its own in the field, distinguishing the individual&#x27;s sex is generally not possible. Sex determination by size is possible by in-hand measurements. In some populations, the female typically may be slightly darker than the male. The plumage coloration across at least 13 accepted subspecies can be highly variable. The upper parts may be brown-black to tawny-buff to pale creamy gray, typically showing dense freckling on the forehead and crown, stripes on the nape, sides, and back of the neck, and dark splotches on the pale ground colour of the back, mantle, and scapulars. A narrow buff band, freckled with brown or buff, often runs up from the base of the bill, above the inner part of the eye, and along the inner edge of the black-brown ear tufts. The rump and upper tail-coverts are delicately patterned with dark vermiculations and fine, wavy barring, the extent of which varies with subspecies. The underwing coverts and undertail coverts are similar, but tend to be more strongly barred in brownish-black.

The primaries and secondaries are brown with broad, dark brown bars and dark brown tips, and grey or buff irregular lines. A complete moult takes place each year between July and December. The facial disc is tawny-buff, speckled with black-brown, so densely on the outer edge of the disc as to form a &quot;frame&quot; around the face. The chin and throat are white with a brownish central streak. The feathers of the upper breast generally have brownish-black centres and reddish-brown edges except for the central ones, which have white edges. The chin and throat may appear white continuing down the center of the upper breast. The lower breast and belly feathers are creamy-brown to tawny buff to off-white with a variable amount of fine dark wavy barring, on a tawny-buff ground colour. The legs and feet (which are feathered almost to the talons) are likewise marked on a buff ground colour but more faintly. The tail is tawny-buff, mottled dark grey-brown with about six black-brown bars. The bill and feet are black. The iris is most often orange but is fairly variable. In some European birds, the iris is a bright reddish, blood-orange colour but then in subspecies found in arid, desert-like habitats, the iris can range into an orange-yellow colour (most closely related species generally have yellowish irises, excluding the Indian eagle-owl).

===Standard measurements and physiology===
Among standard measurements for the Eurasian eagle-owl, the wing chord measures , the tail measures long, the tarsus measures , and the total length of the bill is . The wings are reportedly the smallest in proportion to the body weight of any European owl, when measured by the weight per area of wing size, was found to be 0.72 g/cm2. Thus, they have quite high wing loading. The great horned owl has even smaller wings (0.8 g/cm2) relative to its body size. The golden eagle has slightly lower wing loading proportionately (0.65 g/cm2), so the aerial abilities of the two species (beyond the eagle&#x27;s spectacular ability to stoop) may not be as disparate as expected. Some other owls, such as barn owls, short-eared owls (&quot;Asio flammeus&quot;), and even the related snowy owls have lower wing loading relative to their size, so are presumably able to fly faster, with more agility, and for more extended periods than the Eurasian eagle-owl. In the relatively small race &quot;B. b. hispanus&quot;, the middle claw, the largest talon, (as opposed to rear hallux-claw, which is the largest in accipitrids) was found to measure from in length. A female examined in Britain (origins unspecified) had a middle claw measuring , on par in length with a large female golden eagle hallux-claw. Generally, owls do not have talons as proportionately large as those of accipitrids, but have stronger, more robust feet relative to their size. Accipitrids use their talons to inflict organ damage and blood loss, whereas typical owls use their feet to constrict their prey to death, the talons serving only to hold the prey in place or provide incidental damage. The talons of the Eurasian eagle-owl are very large and not often exceeded in size by diurnal raptors. Unlike the great horned owls, the overall foot size and strength of the Eurasian eagle-owl is not known to have been tested, but the considerably smaller horned owl has one of the strongest grips ever measured in a bird.

The feathers of the ear tufts in Spanish birds (when not damaged) were found to measure from . The ear openings (covered in feathers as in all birds) are relatively uncomplicated for an owl, but are also large, being larger on the right than on the left as in most owls, and proportionately larger than those of the great horned owl. In the female, the ear opening averages on the right and on the left, and in males, averages on the right and on the left. The depth of the facial disc and the size and complexity of the ear opening are directly correlated to the importance of sound in an owl&#x27;s hunting behaviour. Examples of owls with more complicated ear structures and deeper facial disc are barn owls, long-eared owls (&quot;Asio otus&quot;), and boreal owls (&quot;Aegolius funereus&quot;). Given the uncomplicated structure of their ear openings and relatively shallow, undefined facial discs, hunting by ear is secondary to hunting by sight in eagle-owls; this seems to be true for &quot;Bubo&quot; in general. More sound-based hunters such as the aforementioned species likely focus their hunting activity in more complete darkness. Also, owls with white throat patches such as the Eurasian eagle-owl are more likely to be active in low-light conditions in the hours before and after sunrise and sunset rather than the darkest times in the middle of the night. The boreal and barn owls, to extend these examples, lack obvious visual cues such as white throat patches (puffed up in displaying eagle-owls), again indicative of primary activity being in darker periods.

===Distinguishing from other species===

The great size, bulky, barrel-shaped build, erect ear tufts, and orange eyes render this as a distinctive species. Other than general morphology, the above features differ markedly from those of two of the next largest subarctic owl species in Europe and western Asia, which are the great grey owl and the greyish to chocolate-brown Ural owl (&quot;Strix uralensis&quot;), both of which have no ear tufts and have a distinctly rounded head, rather than the blocky shape of the eagle-owl&#x27;s head. The snowy owl is obviously distinctive from most eagle-owls, but during winter the palest Eurasian eagle-owl race (&quot;B. b. sibiricus&quot;) can appear off-white. Nevertheless, the latter is still distinctively an ear-tufted Eurasian eagle-owl and lacks the pure white background colour and variable blackish spotting of the slightly smaller species (which has relatively tiny, vestigial ear tufts that have only been observed to have flared on rare occasions).
The long-eared owl has a somewhat similar plumage to the eagle-owl, but is considerably smaller (an average female eagle-owl may be twice as long and 10 times heavier than an average long-eared owl). Long-eared owls in Eurasia have vertical striping like that of the Eurasian eagle-owl, while long-eared owls in North America show a more horizontal striping like that of great horned owls. Whether these are examples of mimicry either way is unclear but it is known that both &quot;Bubo&quot; owls are serious predators of long-eared owls. The same discrepancy in underside streaking has also been noted in the Eurasian and American representations of the grey owl. A few other related species overlap minimally in range in Asia, mainly in East Asia and the southern reaches of the Eurasian eagle-owl&#x27;s range. Three fish owls appear to overlap in range, the brown (&quot;Ketupa zeylonensis&quot;) in at least northern Pakistan, probably Kashmir, and discontinuously in southern Turkey, the tawny (&quot;K. flavipes&quot;) through much of eastern China, and Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl in the Russian Far East, northeastern China, and Hokkaido. Fish owls are distinctively different looking, possessing more scraggy ear tufts that hang to the side rather than sit erect on top of the head, and generally have more uniform, brownish plumages without the contrasting darker streaking of an eagle-owl. The brown fish owl has no feathering on the tarsus or feet, and the tawny has feathering only on the upper portion of the tarsi, but the Blakiston&#x27;s is nearly as extensively feathered on the tarsi and feet as the eagle-owl. Tawny and brown fish owls are both slightly smaller than co-occurring Eurasian eagle-owls, and Blakiston&#x27;s fish owls are similar or slightly larger than co-occurring large northern eagle-owls. Fish owls, being tied to the edges of fresh water, where they hunt mainly fish and crabs, also have slightly differing, and more narrow, habitat preferences.

In the lower Himalayas of northern Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir, along with the brown fish owl, the Eurasian eagle-owl at the limit of its distribution may co-exist with at least two to three other eagle-owls. One of these, the dusky eagle-owl (&quot;B. coromandus&quot;) is smaller, with more uniform tan-brownish plumage, untidy uniform light streaking rather than the Eurasian&#x27;s dark streaking below and an even less well-defined facial disc. The dusky is usually found in slightly more enclosed woodland areas than Eurasian eagle-owls. Another is possibly the spot-bellied eagle-owl (&quot;B. nipalensis&quot;), which is strikingly different looking, with stark brown plumage, rather than the warm hues typical of the Eurasian, bold spotting on a whitish background on the belly, and somewhat askew ear tufts that are bold white with light brown crossbars on the front. Both species may occur in some parts of the Himalayan foothills, but they are not currently verified to occur in the same area, in part because of the spot-bellied&#x27;s preference for dense, primary forest. Most similar, with basically the same habitat preferences and the only one verified to co-occur with the Eurasian eagle-owls of the race &quot;B. b. turcomanus&quot; in Kashmir is the Indian eagle-owl (&quot;B. bengalensis&quot;). The Indian species is smaller, with a bolder, blackish facial disc border, more rounded and relatively smaller wings, and partially unfeathered toes. Far to the west, the pharaoh eagle-owl (&quot;B. ascalaphus&quot;) also seemingly overlaps in range with the Eurasian, at least in Jordan. Although also relatively similar to the Eurasian eagle-owl, the pharaoh eagle-owl is distinguished by its smaller size, paler, more washed-out plumage, and the diminished size of its ear tufts.

===Moulting===
The Eurasian eagle-owls&#x27; feathers are lightweight and robust, but nevertheless need to be replaced periodically as they become worn. In the Eurasian eagle-owl, this happens in stages, and the first moult starts the year after hatching with some body feathers and wing coverts being replaced. The next year, the three central secondaries on each wing and three middle tail feathers are shed and regrow, and the following year, two or three primaries and their coverts are lost. In the final year of this postjuvenile moult, the remaining primaries are moulted and all the juvenile feathers will have been replaced. Another moult takes place during years 6–12 of the bird&#x27;s life. This happens between June and October after the conclusion of the breeding season, and again it is a staged process with six to nine main flight feathers being replaced each year. Such a moulting pattern lasting several years is repeated throughout the bird&#x27;s life.

==Taxonomy==
The Eurasian eagle-owl was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Strix bulbo&quot;. Although Linnaeus specified the &quot;habitat&quot; as &quot;Europa&quot; the type locality is restricted to Sweden. The Eurasian eagle-owl is now placed in the genus &quot;Bubo&quot; that was introduced by André Duméril in 1805.

The genus &quot;Bubo&quot; with 20 extant species includes most of the larger owl species in the world today. Based on an extensive fossil record and a central distribution of extant species on that continent, &quot;Bubo&quot; appears to have evolved into existence in Africa, although early radiations seem to branch from southern Asia, as well. Two genera belonging to the scops owls complex, the giant scops owls (&quot;Otus gurneyi&quot;) found in Asia and the &quot;Ptilopsis&quot; or the white-faced scops owl found in Africa, although firmly ensconced in the scops owl group, appear to share some characteristics with the eagle-owls. The &quot;Strix&quot; genus is also related to &quot;Bubo&quot;, and is considered a &quot;sister complex&quot;, with &quot;Pulsatrix&quot; possibly being intermediate between the two. The Eurasian eagle-owl appears to represent an expansion of the genus &quot;Bubo&quot; into the Eurasian continent. A few of the other species of &quot;Bubo&quot; seem to have been derived from the Eurasian eagle-owl, making it a &quot;paraspecies&quot;, or they at least share a relatively recent common ancestor.

The Pharaoh eagle-owl, distributed in the Arabian Peninsula and sections of the Sahara Desert through North Africa where rocky outcrops are found, was until recently considered a subspecies of the Eurasian eagle-owl. The Pharaoh eagle-owl apparently differs about 3.8% in mitochondrial DNA from the Eurasian eagle-owl, well past the minimum genetic difference to differentiate species of 1.5%. Smaller and paler than Eurasian eagle-owls, the Pharaoh eagle-owl can also be considered a distinct species largely due to its higher-pitched and more descending call, and the observation that Eurasian eagle-owls formerly found in Morocco (&quot;B. b. hispanus&quot;) apparently did not breed with the co-existing Pharaoh eagle-owls. On the contrary, the race still found together with the Pharaoh eagle-owl in the wild (&quot;B. b. interpositus&quot;) in the central Middle East has been found to interbreed in the wild with the Pharaoh eagle-owl, although genetical materials have indicated &quot;B. b. interpositus&quot; may itself be a distinct species from the Eurasian eagle-owl, as it differs from the nominate subspecies of the Eurasian eagle-owl by 2.8% in mitochondrial DNA. For three Asian Eurasian eagle-owl subspecies (&quot;B. b. ussuriensis&quot;, &quot;B. b. kiautschensis&quot; and &quot;B. b. hemachlana&quot;, respectively), it was found that they met the criterion for subspecies well, with a high haplotype diversity and in spite of a relatively recent common ancestor and low genetic diversity. The Indian eagle-owl (&quot;B. bengalensis&quot;) was also considered a subspecies of the Eurasian eagle-owl until recently, but its smaller size, distinct voice (more clipped and high-pitched than the Eurasian), and the fact that it is largely allopatric in distribution (filling out the Indian subcontinent) with other Eurasian eagle-owl races has led to it being considered a distinct species. The mitochondrial DNA of the Indian species also appears considerably distinct from the Eurasian species. The Cape eagle-owl (&quot;B. capensis&quot;) appears to represent a return of this genetic line back into the African continent, where it leads a lifestyle similar to Eurasian eagle-owls, albeit far to the south. Another offshoot of the northern &quot;Bubo&quot; group is the snowy owl. It appears to have separated from other &quot;Bubo&quot; species at least 4 million years ago.

The fourth and most famous derivation of the evolutionary line that includes the Eurasian eagle-owl is the great horned owl, which appears to have been the result of primitive eagle-owls spreading into North America. According to some authorities, the great horned owls and Eurasian eagle-owls are barely distinct as species, with a similar level of divergence in their plumages as the Eurasian and North American representations of the great grey owl or the long-eared owl. More outward physical differences exist between the great horned owl and the Eurasian eagle-owl than in those two examples, including a great size difference favoring the Eurasian species, the great horned owl&#x27;s horizontal rather than vertical underside barring, yellow rather than orange eyes, and a much stronger black bracket to the facial disc, not to mention a number of differences in their reproductive behaviour and distinctive voices. Furthermore, genetic research has revealed that the snowy owl is more closely related to the great horned owl than are Eurasian eagle-owls. The most closely related species beyond the Pharaoh, Indian, and Cape eagle-owls to the Eurasian eagle-owl is the smaller, less powerful and African spotted eagle-owl (&quot;B. africanus&quot;), which was likely to have divided from the line before they radiated away from Africa. Somehow, genetic materials indicate the spotted eagle-owl appears to share a more recent ancestor with the Indian eagle-owl than with the Eurasian eagle-owl or even the sympatric Cape eagle-owl. Eurasian eagle-owls in captivity have produced apparently healthy hybrids with both the Indian eagle-owl and the great horned owl. The pharaoh, Indian, and Cape eagle-owls and the great horned owl are all broadly similar in size to each other, but all are considerably smaller than the Eurasian eagle-owl, which averages at least 15–30% larger in linear dimensions and 30–50% larger in body mass than these other related species, possibly as the eagle-owls adapted to warmer climates and smaller prey. Fossils from southern France have indicated that during the Middle Pleistocene, Eurasian eagle-owls (this paleosubspecies is given the name &quot;B. b. davidi&quot;) were larger than they are today, even larger were those found in Azerbaijan and in the Caucasus (either &quot;B. b. bignadensis&quot; or &quot;B. bignadensis&quot;), which were deemed to date to the Late Pleistocene. About 12 subspecies are recognized today.

===Subspecies===


* &quot;B. b. hispanus&quot; (Rothschild and Hartert, 1910) – Also known as the Spanish eagle-owl or the Iberian eagle-owl. This subspecies mainly occurs on the Iberian Peninsula, where it occupies a majority of Spain and scattered spots in Portugal. &quot;B. b. hispanus&quot; also inhabited, at least historically, wooded areas of the Atlas Mountains in Northern Africa, making it the only subspecies of Eurasian eagle-owl known to breed in Africa, but this population is thought to be extinct. In terms of its life history, this may be the most extensively studied subspecies of eagle-owl. The Spanish eagle-owl is the most similar in plumage to the nominate subspecies amongst other subspecies, but tends to be a somewhat lighter, more greyish colour, with generally lighter streaking and a paler belly. In males, wing chord length can range from and in females from . Wingspans in this subspecies can vary from , averaging about . Among standard measurements of &quot;B. b. hispanus&quot;, the tail is , the total bill length is and the tarsus is . Adult male &quot;B. b. hispanus&quot; from Spain weigh , averaging , while females weigh from , averaging .
* &quot;B. b. bubo&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – Also known as the European eagle-owl, the nominate subspecies inhabits continental Europe from near the Arctic Circle in Norway, Sweden, Finland, the southern Kola Peninsula, and Arkhangelsk where it ranges north to about latitude 64° 30&#x27; N., southward to the Baltic Sea, central Germany, to southeastern Belgium, eastern, central, and southern France to Northern Spain and parts of Italy including Sicily, and through Central and Southeastern Europe to Greece. It intergrades with &quot;B. b. ruthenus&quot; in northern Russia around the basin of the upper Mezen River and in the eastern vicinity of Gorki Leninskiye, Tambov and Voronezh, and intergrades with &quot;B. b. interpositus&quot; in northern Ukraine. This is a medium-sized race, measuring in wing chord length in males and . In captive owls of this subspecies, the mean wingspan were for males and for females. The total bill length is . Adult male European eagle-owls from Norway weigh , averaging , while females there weigh from , averaging . Unsurprisingly, adult owls from western Finland were about the same size, averaging . Another set of Finnish eagle-owls averaged somewhat larger still, with males averaging and females averaging . The subspecies seems to follow Bergmann&#x27;s rule in regards to body size decreasing closer to the Equator, as specimens from central Europe average in body mass and those from Italy average about . The weight range for eagle-owls in Italy is . The nominate subspecies is perhaps the darkest of eagle-owl subspecies. Many nominate birds are heavily overlaid with broad black streaking over the upper-parts, head and chest. While generally a brownish base-colour, many nominate owls can appear rich rufous, especially about the head, upper-back and wing primaries. The lower belly is usually a buff brown, as opposed to whitish or yellowish in several other subspecies. Birds seen from Italy may show a tendency to be smaller than more northern birds and are reportedly duller, possessing paler ground coloration, and more narrow streaks. In Scandinavia, some birds are so darkly plumaged as to give a blackish-brown impression with almost no paler colour showing.
* &quot;B. b. ruthenus&quot; (Buturlin and Zhitkov, 1906) – May be also known as the eastern eagle-owl. This subspecies replaces the nominate in eastern Russia from about latitude 660 N. in the Timan-Pechora Basin south to the western Ural Mountains and the upper Don and lower Volga Rivers. This is a fairly large subspecies going on wing chord length, which is in males and in females. The subspecies is intermediate in coloration between the nominate subspecies and &quot;B. b. sibiricus&quot;. &quot;B. b. ruthenus&quot; may be confused with &quot;B. b. interpositus&quot;, even by authoritative ornithologists. &quot;B. b. interpositus&quot; is darker than &quot;B. b. ruthenus&quot;, distinctly more yellowish, less gray, and its brown pattern is darker, heavier, and more regular. The entire colour pattern of &quot;B. b. interpositus&quot; is brighter, richer, and more contrasting than that of &quot;B. b. ruthenus&quot;, but &quot;B. b. interpositus&quot;, though very well characterized, is an intermediate subspecies.
* &quot;B. b. interpositus&quot; (Rothschild and Hartert, 1910) – May be also known as Aharoni&#x27;s eagle-owl or the Byzantine eagle-owl. &quot;B. b. interpositus&quot; ranges from southern Russia, south of the nominate, with which it intergrades in northern Ukraine, from Bessarabia and the steppes of Ukraine north to Kyiv and Kharkiv then eastward to the Crimea, the Caucasus and Transcaucasia to northwestern and northern Iran (Elburz, region of Tehran, and probably the southern Caspian districts), and through Asia Minor south to Syria and Iraq but not to the Syrian desert where it is replaced by the pharaoh eagle-owl. The latter and &quot;B. b. interpositus&quot; reportedly hybridize from western Syria south to southern Palestine. &quot;B. b. interpositus&quot; may be a distinct species from the Eurasian eagle-owl based on genetic studies. This medium-sized subspecies is about the same size as the nominate subspecies &quot;B. b. bubo&quot;, with male wing chord lengths and female lengths of . It differs from the nominate subspecies by being paler and more yellow, less ferruginous, and by having a sharper brown pattern; from &quot;B. b. turcomanus&quot; by being very much darker and less yellow, and also by being much more sharply and heavily patterned with brown. Aharoni&#x27;s eagle-owl is darker and more rusty than &quot;B. b. ruthenus&quot;.
* &quot;B. b. sibiricus&quot; (Gloger, 1833) – Also known as the western Siberian eagle-owl. This subspecies is distributed from the Ural Mountains of western Siberia and Bashkiria to the mid Ob River and the western Altai Mountains, north to limits of the taiga, the most northerly distribution known in the species overall. &quot;B. b. sibiricus&quot; is a large subspecies, wherein the males measure in wing chord length, while the females are . Captive males were found to measure in wingspan and weigh ; whereas the females measure in wingspan and weigh . Males were cited with a mean body mass of approximately . This subspecies is physically the most distinctive of all the Eurasian eagle-owls, and is sometimes considered the most &quot;beautiful and striking&quot;. It is the most pale of the eagle-owl subspecies; the general coloration is a buffy off-white overlaid with dark markings. The crown, hindneck and underparts are streaked blackish but somewhat sparingly, with the lower breast and belly indistinctly barred, the primary coverts dark, contrasting with rest of the wing. The head, back and shoulders are only somewhat dark unlike in most other subspecies. In the eastern limits of its range, &quot;B. b. sibiricus&quot; may intergrade with &quot;B. b. yenisseensis&quot;.
* &quot;B. b. yenisseensis&quot; (Buturlin, 1911) – Also known as the eastern Siberian eagle-owl. This subspecies is found in central Siberia from about the Ob eastward to Lake Baikal, north to about latitudes 580 to 590 N on the Yenisei River, south to the Altai, Tarbagatai and the Saur Mountain ranges and in Tannu Tuva and Khangai Mountains in northwestern Mongolia, grading into &quot;B. b. sibiricus&quot; near Tomsk in the west and into &quot;B. b. ussuriensis&quot; in the east of northern Mongolia. The zone of intergradations with the latter in Mongolia seems to be quite extensive, with intermediate eagle-owls being especially prevalent around the Tuul River Valley, resulting in owls intermediate in coloration between &quot;B. b. yenisseensis&quot; and &quot;B. b. ussuriensis&quot;. &quot;B. b. yenisseensis&quot; is a large subspecies, with wing chord lengths of in males and in females. &quot;B. b. yenisseensis&quot; is typically much darker with more yellowish ground colour than &quot;B. b. sibiricus&quot;. It does have a similar amount of dazzling white on its underwing as does &quot;sibiricus&quot;. It is buffy-greyish overall with well-expressed dark patterning on the upper-parts and around the head. The underside is overall pale greyish with black streaking.
* &quot;B. b. jakutensis&quot; (Buturlin, 1908) – May be also known as the Yakutian eagle-owl. This subspecies inhabits northeastern Siberia, from southern Yakutia north to about latitude 640 N., west in the basin of the Vilyuy River to the upper Nizhnyaya Tunguska River, and east to the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk from Magadan south to the Khabarovsk Krai. It has been reported farther north, from the regions of the upper Kolyma River and the upper Anadyr. Eurasian eagle-owls are absent in Kamchatka and north of the Verkhoyansk Range. This is a large subspecies, rivaling the proceeding two subspecies as the largest of all eagle-owls, going on wing chord length, which subspecies is largest is unclear considering the extensive size overlap in wing size. The wing chord is in males and in females. &quot;B. b. jakutensis&quot; is much darker and browner above than both &quot;B. b. sibiricus&quot; and &quot;B. b. yenisseensis&quot;, though its coloration is more diffused, less sharp than the latter. It is more distinctly streaked and barred below than &quot;B. b. sibiricus&quot; while being whiter and more heavily vermiculated below than &quot;B. b. yenisseensis&quot;. This subspecies evidences an almost disheveled, wild appearance suggesting more than other races the fish owl group. &quot;B. b. jakutensis&quot; has more muted brown and conspicuously elongated feathers, somewhat looser hanging ear tufts and a bulky, large-headed and almost neckless look even for an eagle-owl.
* &quot;B. b. ussuriensis&quot; (Poljakov, 1915) – Would presumably be also known as the Ussuri eagle-owl. This subspecies ranges from southeastern Siberia, to the south of the range of &quot;B. b. jakutensis&quot;, southward through eastern Transbaikal, Amurland, Sakhalin, Ussuriland and the Manchurian portion of the Chinese provinces of Shaanxi, Shanxi and Hebei. This subspecies is also reportedly found in the southern Kuril Islands ranging down to as far as northern Hokkaido, the only Japanese representation in the Eurasian eagle-owl species, although this is apparently not a stable, viable population. Going on wing chord length, &quot;B. b. ussuriensis&quot; is slightly smaller than the various subspecies from further north in Siberia. Males have a wing chord length of and females are . This subspecies differs from &quot;B. b. jakutensis&quot; by being much darker throughout. It is also darker than &quot;B. b. yenisseensis&quot;. The brown markings on the upper parts of &quot;B. b. ussuriensis&quot; are much more extensive and diffused than in &quot;B. b. jakutensis&quot; or &quot;B. b. yenisseensis&quot;, with the result that the white markings are much less conspicuous in &quot;B. b. ussuriensis&quot; than in the other two subspecies. The under parts are also more buffy, much less white, and more heavily streaked and vermiculated in &quot;B. b. ussuriensis&quot; than in the two more northerly, larger subspecies. It overlaps considerably with &quot;jakutensis&quot; and some birds are of an intermediate appearance.
* &quot;B. b. turcomanus&quot; (Eversmann, 1835) – Also known as the steppe eagle-owl. It is distributed from Kazakhstan between the Volga and upper Ural Rivers, the Caspian Sea coast and the former Aral Sea, but replaced in that country by &quot;B. b. omissus&quot; in the mountainous south and in the coastal region of the Mangyshlak Peninsula by &quot;B. b. gladkovi&quot;. Out of Kazakhstan, the range of &quot;B. b. turcomanus&quot; continues through the Transbaikal and the Tarim Basin to western Mongolia. This subspecies appears to be variable in size, but is generally medium-sized. Males can range in wing chord length from and females from . In standard measurements, the tail is , the tarsus is and the bill is . This subspecies can reportedly weigh from . The plumage background colour is pale, yellowish-buff. The dark patterns on the upper- and underparts is paler, less well-defined and more shattered than in &quot;B. b. interpositus&quot;. Dark longitudinal patterning on the under-parts discontinue above the belly. &quot;B. b. turcomanus&quot; is greyer than &quot;B. b. hemalachanus&quot; but is otherwise somewhat similar-looking. This subspecies is unique in that it seems to shun mountainous and obvious rocky habitats in favor of low hills, plateaus, lowlands, steppes, and semideserts at or near sea-level.
* &quot;B. b. omissus&quot; (Dementiev, 1932) – May be also known as the Turkoman eagle-owl or the Turkmenian eagle-owl. &quot;B. b. omissus&quot; is native to Turkmenistan and adjacent regions of northeastern Iran and western Xinjiang. This is a small subspecies (only &quot;nikolskii&quot; averages smaller among currently accepted races), with males possessing a wing chord length of and females of . &quot;B. b. omissus&quot; may be considered a typical sub-desert form. The general coloration is an ochre to buffy off-yellow; with the dark pattern on the upper- and under-parts being relatively undefined. The dark shaft-streaks on nape are very narrow, while the dark longitudinal patterning on the underparts does not cover the belly. A dark cross-pattern on the belly and flanks is thinner and paler than in &quot;B. b. turcomanus&quot; and some individuals may appear almost all pale below. Compared to &quot;B. b. nikolskii&quot;, which may occupy the more southern reaches of the same upland ranges, it is somewhat larger as well as darker, less distinctly yellowish and more heavily streaked.
* &quot;B. b. nikolskii&quot; (Zarudny, 1905) – May be also known in English as either the Afghan eagle-owl or the Iranian eagle-owl. The range of &quot;B. b. nikolskii&quot; appears to extend from the Balkan Mountains and Kopet Dagh in southern Transcaspia eastward to southeastern Uzbekistan or to perhaps southwestern Tadzhikistan, then southward 290 N. It may range north to Iran, Afghanistan and Baluchistan south to the region of Kalat, or at about latitude of Hindu Kush. In Iran, &quot;B. b. nikolskii&quot; is replaced by &quot;B. b. interpositus&quot; in the north, and probably also in the northwest, and probably by &quot;B. b. hemalachana&quot; in Badakhshan, part of northeastern Afghanistan. The birds of southern Tadzhikistan found west of the Pamirs are more or less intermediate between &quot;B. b. omissus&quot; and &quot;B. b. hemachalana&quot;. This is the smallest known subspecies of eagle-owl, though the only known measurements have been of wing chord length. Males can measure and females can measure in wing chord. Other than its smaller size, &quot;B. b. nikolskii&quot; is distinguished from the somewhat similar &quot;B. b. omissus&quot; by its rusty wash and being less dark above.
* &quot;B. b. hemachalana&quot; (Hume, 1873) – Also known as the Himalayan eagle-owl. The range of &quot;B. b. hemachalana&quot; extends from the Himalayas, from Pakistan through Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh to at least Bhutan, also living in Tibet. Its range continues also westward to the Tian Shan system in Russian Turkestan, west to the Karatau, north to the Dzungarian Alatau, east to at least the Tekkes Valley in Xinjiang, and south to the regions of Kashgar, Yarkant and probably the western Kunlun Mountains. This bird is partly migratory, descending to the plains of Turkmenistan with colder winter weather, and apparently reaches northern Balochistan. This is a medium-sized subspecies, though it is larger than other potentially abutting arid Asian eagle-owl subspecies, which share a somewhat similar yellowish ground colour. The male attains a wing chord length of , while the female&#x27;s wing chord is . The bill measures in length. 11 adult eagle-owls of the subspecies from the Tibetan Plateau averaged in tail length, in tarsus length and scaled an average of in mass. This subspecies is physically similar to &quot;B. b. turcomanus&quot; but the background colour is more light yellowish-brown and less buff. The dark patterns on the upperparts and underparts are more expressed and less regular than in &quot;B. b. turcomanus&quot; and &quot;B. b. omissus&quot; and the general colour from the mantle to the ear tufts is a more consistent brownish colour than most other abutting races. &quot;B. b. hemachalana&quot; differs from &quot;B. b. yenisseensis&quot; by being much more yellow on the rump, under tail coverts, and outer tail feathers, rather than grayish or whitish, and the ground coloration of its body is more yellowish above, and is less whitish below. Dark longitudinal pattern on the under-parts cover the forebelly.
* &quot;B. b. kiautschensis&quot; (Reichenow, 1903) – This subspecies could be also known as the North Chinese eagle-owl. It ranges from South Korea and China, south of the range of &quot;B. b. ussuriensis&quot;, southward to Guangdong and Yunnan, and inland to Sichuan and southern Gansu. This is a smallish subspecies, with the male&#x27;s wing chord measuring and the female&#x27;s being . In Korea, this subspecies was found to average in mass, with a range of . &quot;B. b. kiautschensis&quot; is much darker, more tawny and rufous, and slightly smaller than &quot;B. b. ussuriensis&quot;. According to museum accounts, it resembles the nominate subspecies from Europe (though obviously considerably disparate in distribution) rather closely in coloration but differs from it by being paler, more mottled, and less heavily marked with brown on the upper parts, by having narrower dark shaft streaks on the under parts, which average also duller and more ocher, and by averaging smaller. Images from South Korea of captive and wild owls show, on the contrary, that this race may be easily as darkly marked as most nominate eagle-owls with a more rufous base colour altogether suggesting a richer and more dusky-colored eagle-owl than from almost any other population.
* &quot;B. b. swinhoei&quot; (Hartert, 1913) – This subspecies could be also known as the South Chinese eagle-owl. It is endemic to southeastern China. A quite rufescent form, it is somewhat similar to &quot;B. b. kiautschensis&quot;. In this smallish subspecies, the wing chord measures in both sexes. This is a rather poorly known and described subspecies and is considered invalid by some authorities.

==Habitat==
Eagle-owls are distributed somewhat sparsely, but can potentially inhabit a wide range of habitats, with a partiality for irregular topography. They have been found in habitats as diverse as northern coniferous forests to the edge of vast deserts. Essentially, Eurasian eagle-owls have been found living in almost every climatic and environmental condition on the Eurasian continent, excluding the greatest extremities, i.e. they are absent from humid rainforest in Southeast Asia, and the high Arctic tundra, both of which they are more or less replaced by other species of &quot;Bubo&quot; owls. They are often found in the largest numbers in areas where cliffs and ravines are surrounded by a scattering of trees and bushes. Grassland areas such as alpine meadows or desert-like steppe can also host them so long as they have the cover and protection of rocky areas. The preference of eagle-owls for places with irregular topography has been reported in most known studies. The obvious benefit of such nesting locations is that both nests and daytime roosts located in rocky areas and/or steep slopes would be less accessible to predators, including man. Also, they may be attracted to the vicinity of riparian or wetlands areas, because the soft soil of wet areas is conducive to burrowing by the small, terrestrial mammals normally preferred in the diet, such as voles and rabbits.

Due to their preference for rocky areas, the species is often found in mountainous areas, and can be found up to elevations of in the Alps, in the Himalayas, and in the adjacent Tibetan Plateau. They can also be found living at sea level and may nest amongst rocky sea cliffs. Despite their success in areas such as subarctic zones and mountains that are frigid for much of the year, warmer conditions seem to result in more successful breeding attempts per studies in the Eifel region of Germany. In a study from Spain, areas primarily consisting of woodlands (52% of study area being forested) were preferred with pine trees predominating the oaks in habitats used, as opposed to truly mixed pine-oak woodland. Pine and other coniferous stands are often preferred in great horned owls, as well, due to the constant density, which make overlooking the large birds more likely. In mountainous forest, they are not generally found in enclosed wooded areas, as is the tawny owl (&quot;Strix alucco&quot;), instead usually near forest edge. Only 2.7% of the habitat included in the territorial ranges for eagle-owls per the habitat study in Spain consisted of cultivated or agricultural land. Compared to golden eagles, though, they can visit cultivated land more regularly in hunting forays due to their nocturnal habits, which allow them to largely evade human activity. Other accounts make clear that farmland is only frequented where its less intensively farmed, holds more extensive treed and bushy areas, and often has limited to no irrigation; farmland areas with fallow or abandoned fields are more likely to hold
more prey, so are prone to less frequent human disturbance. In the Italian Alps, almost no pristine habitat remained, and eagle-owls nested locally in the vicinity of towns, villages, and ski resorts.

Although found in the largest numbers in areas sparsely populated by humans, farmland is sometimes inhabited, and they even have been observed living in park-like or other quiet settings within European cities. Since 2005, at least five pairs have nested in Helsinki. This is due in part to feral European rabbits (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;) having recently populated the Helsinki area, originally from pet rabbits released to the wild. The number is expected to increase due to the growth of the European rabbit population in Helsinki. European hares (&quot;Lepus europaeus&quot;), the often preferred prey species by biomass of the eagle-owls in their natural habitat, live only in rural areas of Finland, not in the city centre. In June 2007, an eagle-owl nicknamed &#x27;Bubi&#x27; landed in the crowded Helsinki Olympic Stadium during the European Football Championship qualification match between Finland and Belgium. The match was interrupted for six minutes. After tiring of the match, following Jonathan Johansson&#x27;s opening goal for Finland, the bird left the scene. Finland&#x27;s national football team have had the nickname &quot;Huuhkajat&quot; (Finnish for &quot;Eurasian eagle-owls&quot;) ever since. The owl was named &quot;Helsinki Citizen of the Year&quot; in December 2007. In 2020, a brood of three eagle-owl chicks was raised by their mother on a large, well-foliaged planter on an apartment window in the city centre of Geel, Belgium.

==Distribution==
The Eurasian eagle-owl is one of the most widely distributed of all owl species, although it is far less wide-ranging than the barn owl, the short-eared owl (&quot;Asio flammeus&quot;) and long-eared owl and lacks the circumpolar range of boreal species such as great grey owl, boreal owl and northern hawk owl (&quot;Surnia ulula&quot;). This eagle-owl reaches its westernmost range in the Iberian Peninsula, both almost throughout Spain and more spottily in Portugal. From there, the Eurasian eagle-owl ranges widely in the south of France from Toulouse to Monaco and as far north into the central part of the country as in Allier. Farther north, they are found sporadically and discontinuously in Luxembourg, southern and western Belgium and scarcely into the Netherlands. It is infrequently found in southern and central United Kingdom. In Germany, the eagle-owl can be found in large but highly discontinuous areas, mostly in the south and central areas but is almost entirely absent in areas such as Brandenburg. Across from its south German range, this species range is nearly continuous into the Czech Republic, Slovakia, northern and eastern Hungary and very spottily into Poland. In the fairly montane countries of Switzerland and Austria, the eagle-owl can be found fairly broadly. In Italy, the Eurasian eagle-owl is found where the habitat is favorable in much of the northern, western and central portions down to as far south Melito di Porto Salvo. From Italy, this species sweeps quite broadly along the Mediterranean coast in Southeastern Europe from Slovenia mostly continuously to most of Greece and Bulgaria. In eastern Europe, the Eurasian eagle-owl is found essentially throughout from central Romania to Estonia. The species also occupies a majority of Finland and Scandinavia, where most broadly found in Norway, somewhat more spottily in Sweden and in Denmark it is found widely in Jutland (absent from the islands).

The Eurasian eagle-owl&#x27;s range in Russia is truly massive, with the species apparently nearly unbound by habitat, with their distribution only excluding them from the true Arctic zone, i.e. their range stops around the tree line. If not the most densely populated species, they almost certainly stand as Russia&#x27;s most widely distributed owl species. From Russia, they are found throughout Central Asia, residing continuously in each nation from Kazakhstan down to Afghanistan. In Asia Minor, they are found broadly in Georgia, Azerbaijan and somewhat so in western and southern Turkey but is quite sporadic in distribution overall in Turkey. A spotty range also exists in the Middle East in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Jordan and western Iran, the species being found broadly only in north and western Iran. In South Asia, the Eurasian eagle-owl is found mostly often in northern Pakistan, northern Nepal and Bhutan and more marginally into far northern India. This species resides throughout Mongolia, almost the entirety of China (mainly absent only from southern Yunnan and southern Guangxi). From China and eastern Russia, the Eurasian eagle-owl is found throughout Korea, Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands and rarely into Japan in northern Hokkaido. Besides the Kurils, the farthest eastern part of the range for this species is in Magadan in the Russian Far East.

==Behaviour==

The Eurasian eagle-owl is largely nocturnal in activity, as are most owl species, with its activity focused in the first few hours after sunset and the last few hours before sunrise. In the northern stretches of its range, partial diurnal behaviour has been recorded, including active hunting in broad daylight during the late afternoon. In such areas, full nightfall is essentially non-existent at the peak of summer, so eagle-owls must presumably hunt and actively brood at the nest during daylight. The Eurasian eagle-owl has a number of vocalizations that are used at different times. It will usually select obvious topographic features such as rocky pinnacles, stark ridges and mountain peaks to use as regular song posts. These are dotted along the outer edges of the eagle-owl&#x27;s territory and they are visited often but only for a few minutes at a time.

Vocal activity is almost entirely confined to the colder months from late fall through winter, with vocal activity in October through December mainly having territorial purposes and from January to February being primarily oriented towards courtship and mating purposes. Vocalizations in a Spanish study begin no sooner than 29 minutes after sunset and end no later than 55 minutes before sunrise. The territorial song, which can be heard at great distance, is a deep resonant &quot;ooh-hu&quot; with emphasis on the first syllable for the male, and a more high-pitched and slightly more drawn-out &quot;uh-hu&quot; for the female. It is not uncommon for a pair to perform an antiphonal duet. The widely used name in Germany as well as some other sections of Europe for this species is &quot;uhu&quot; due to its song. At 250–350 Hz, the Eurasian eagle-owls territorial song or call is deeper, farther-carrying and is often considering &quot;more impressive&quot; than the territorial songs of the great horned owl or even that of the slightly larger Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl, although the horned owl&#x27;s call averages slightly longer in duration and the Blakiston&#x27;s call is typically deeper. Other calls include a rather faint, laughter-like &quot;OO-OO-oo&quot; and a harsh &quot;kveck-kveck&quot;. Intruding eagle-owls and other potential dangers may be met with a &quot;terrifying&quot;, extremely loud &quot;hooo&quot;. Raucous barks not unlike those of ural owls or long-eared owls have been recorded but are deeper and more powerful than those species&#x27; barks. Annoyance at close quarters is expressed by bill-clicking and cat-like spitting, and a defensive posture involves lowering the head, ruffling the back feathers, fanning the tail and spreading the wings.

The Eurasian eagle-owl rarely assumes the so-called &quot;tall-thin position&quot;, which is when an owl adopts an upright stance with plumage closely compressed and may stand tightly beside a tree trunk. Among others, the long-eared owl is among the most often reported to sit with this pose. The great horned owl has been more regularly recorded using the tall-thin, if not as consistently as some &quot;Strix&quot; and &quot;Asio&quot; owls, and it is commonly thought to aid camouflage if encountering a threatening or novel animal or sound. The Eurasian eagle-owl is a broad-winged species and engages in a strong, direct flight, usually consisting of shallow wing beats and long, surprisingly fast glides. It has, unusually for an owl, also been known to soar on updrafts on rare occasions. The latter method of flight has led them to be mistaken for &quot;Buteos&quot;, which are smaller and quite differently proportioned. Usually when seen flying during the day, it is due to being disturbed or displaced from its roost by humans or mobbing animals, such as crows. Eurasian eagle-owls are highly sedentary, normally maintaining a single territory throughout their adult lives.

Eurasian eagle-owl are considered a completely non-migratory bird, as are all members of the &quot;Bubo&quot; genus excluding the snowy owl. Even those near the northern limits of their range, where winters are harsh and likely to bear little in food, the eagle-owl does not leave its native range. In 2020, a study presented evidence of a short distance distribution by adult eagle-owls in the fall subsequent to breeding, with 5 adults found to move over away from their nests. There are additionally claimed cases from Russia of Eurasian eagle-owls moving south for the winter, as the icebound, infamously harsh climate there may be too severe even for these hardy birds and their prey. Similarly, Eurasian eagle-owls living in the Tibetan highlands and Himalayas may in some anecdotal cases vacate their normal territories when winter hits and move south. In both of those examples, these are old, unverified reports and there is no evidence whatsoever of consistent, annual migration by Eurasian eagle-owls and the birds may eke out a living on their normal territories even in the sparsest times.

==Dietary biology==
==Breeding==
===Territoriality===
Eurasian eagle-owls are strictly territorial and will defend their territories from interloping eagle-owls year around, but territorial calling appears to peak around October to February. Territory size is similar or occasionally slightly greater than great horned owl: averaging . Territories are established by the male eagle-owl, who selected the highest points in the territory from which to sing. The high prominence of singing perches allows their song to be heard at greater distances and lessens the need for potentially dangerous physical confrontations in the areas where territories may meet. Nearly as important in territorial behaviour as vocalization is the white throat patch. When taxidermied specimens with flared white throats were placed around the perimeter of eagle-owl territories, male eagle-owls reacted quite strongly and often attacked the stuffed owl, reacting more mildly to a stuffed eagle-owl with a non-flared white throat. Females were less likely to be aggressive to mounted specimens and did not seem to vary in their response whether exposed to the specimens with or without the puffed up white patch. In January and February, the primary function for vocalization becomes for the purpose of courtship. More often than not, eagle-owls will pair for life but usually engage in courtship rituals annually, most likely to re-affirm pair bonds. When calling for the purposes of courtship, males tend to bow and hoot loudly but do so in a less contorted manner than the male great horned owl. Courtship in the Eurasian eagle-owl may involve bouts of &quot;duetting&quot;, with the male sitting upright and the female bowing as she calls. There may be mutual bowing, billing and fondling before the female flies to a perch where coitus occurs, usually taking place several times over the course of a few minutes.

===Nests===

The male selects breeding sites and advertises their potential to the female by flying to them and kneading out a small depression (if soil is present) and making staccato notes and clucking noises. Several potential sites may be presented, with the female selecting one. In Baden-Wurttenberg, Germany, the amount of male nest site visits were found to increase in time spent over the pre-laying breeding season from a mean of 29 minutes to 3 hours with frequent incubation like sitting by the male. Like all owls, Eurasian eagle-owls do not build nests or add material but nest on the surface or material already present. Eurasian eagle-owls normally nest on rocks or boulders, most often utilizing cliff ledges and steep slopes, as well as crevices, gullies, holes or caves. Rocky areas that also prove concealing woodlots as well as, for hunting purposes, that border river valleys and grassy scrubland may be especially attractive. If only low rubble is present, they will nest on the ground between rocks. Often, in more densely forested areas, they&#x27;ve been recorded nesting on the ground, often among roots of trees, under large bushes and under fallen tree trunks. Steep slopes with dense vegetation are preferred if nesting on the ground, although some ground nests are surprisingly exposed or in flat spots such as in open spots of the taiga, steppe, ledges of river banks and between wide tree trunks. All Eurasian eagle-owl nests in the largely forested Altai Krai region of Russia were found to be on the ground, usually at the base of pines. This species does not often use other bird&#x27;s nests as does the great horned owl, which often prefers nests built by other animals over any other nesting site. The Eurasian eagle-owl has been recorded in singular cases using nests built by common buzzards (&quot;Buteo buteo&quot;), golden eagle, greater spotted (&quot;Clanga clanga&quot;) and white-tailed eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus albicilla&quot;), common ravens (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;) and black storks (&quot;Ciconia nigra&quot;). Among the eagle-owls of the fairly heavily wooded wildlands of Belarus, they more commonly utilize nests built by other birds than most eagle-owls, i.e. stork or accipitrid nests, but a majority of nests are still located on the ground. This is contrary to the indication that ground nests are selected only if rocky areas or other bird nests are unavailable, as many will utilize ground nests even where large bird nests seem to be accessible. Tree holes being used for nesting sites are even more rarely recorded than nests constructed by other birds. While it may be assumed that the eagle-owl is too large to utilize tree hollows, when other large species like the great grey owl have never been recorded nesting in one, the even more robust Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl nests exclusively in cavernous hollows. The Eurasian eagle-owl often uses the same nest site year after year.

===Parental behaviour===

In Engadin, Switzerland, the male eagle-owl alone hunts until the young are 4 to 5 weeks old and the female spends all her time brooding at the nest. After this point, the female gradually resumes hunting from both herself and the young and thus provides a greater range of food for the young. While it may seem contrary to the species&#x27; highly territorial nature, there is one verified cases of polygamy in Germany, with a male apparently mating with two females, and cooperative brooding in Spain, with a third adult of undetermined sex helping a breeding pair care for the chicks. The response of Eurasian eagle-owls to humans approaching at the nest is quite variable. The species is often rather less aggressive than some other owls, including related species like the spot-bellied eagle-, great horned and snowy owls, many of the northern &quot;Strix&quot; species, and even some rather smaller owl species, which often fearlessly attack any person found to be nearing their nests. Occasionally, if a person climbs to an active nest, the adult female eagle-owl will do a distraction display, in which they feign an injury. This is an uncommon behavior in most owls and is most often associated with small birds trying to falsely draw the attention of potential predators away from their offspring. More commonly, the adults withdraw to a safe distance, as their nests are usually well-camouflaged. Occasionally if cornered both adults and nestlings will do an elaborate threat display, also rare in owls in general, in which the eagle-owls raise their wings into a semi-circle and puff up their feathers, followed by a snapping of their bills. Apparently, eagle-owls of uncertain and probably exotic origin in Britain are likely to react aggressively to humans approaching the nest. Also, aggressive encounters involving eagle-owls around their nest, despite being historically uncommon, apparently have increased in recent decades in Scandinavia. The discrepancy of aggressiveness at the nest between the Eurasian eagle-owl and its Nearctic counterpart may be correlated to variation in the extent of nest predation that the species endured during the evolutionary process.

===Eggs and offspring development===
The eggs are normally laid at intervals of three days and are incubated only by the female. Laying generally begins in late winter but may be later in the year in colder habitats. During the incubation period, the female is brought food at the nest by her mate. A single clutch of white eggs is laid; each egg can measure from long by in width, and will usually weigh about . In Central Europe, eggs average , and in Siberia, eggs average . Their eggs are only slightly larger than those of snowy owls and the nominate subspecies of great horned owl, while similar in size to those of spot-bellied eagle-owls and Blakiston&#x27;s fish owls. The Eurasian eagle-owl&#x27;s eggs are noticeably larger than those of Indian eagle-owl and pharaoh eagle-owls. Usually clutch size is one or two, rarely three or four, and exceptionally to six. The average number of eggs laid varies with latitude in Europe. Clutch size ranges from 2.02 to 2.14 in Spain and the massifs of France, and 1.82 to 1.89 in central Europe and the eastern Alps; in Sweden and Finland, the mean clutch size is 1.56 and 1.87, respectively. While variation based on climate is not unusual for different wide-ranging palearctic species, the higher clutch size of western Mediterranean eagle-owls is also probably driven by the presence of lagomorphs in the diet, which provide high nutritional value than most other regular prey. The average clutch size, attributed as 2.7, was the lowest of any European owl per one study. One species was attributed with an even lower clutch size in North America, the great grey owl with a mean of 2.6, but the mean clutch size was much higher for the same species in Europe, at 4.05.

In Spain, incubation is from mid-January to mid-March, hatching and early nestling period is from late March to early April, fledging and postfledging dependence can range from mid-April to August, and territorial/courtship is anytime hereafter; i.e. the period between the beginning of juvenile dispersal to egg laying; from September to early January. The same general date parameters were followed in southern France. In the Italian Alps, the mean egg-laying date was similarly February 27, but the young were more likely to be dependent later, as all fledglings were still being cared for by the end of August, and some even lingered under parental care until October. In northern climes, the breeding season shifts somewhat later by as much as a month so that egg laying may be as late as late March or early April. Nonetheless, the Eurasian eagle-owl is one of the earliest nesting bird species in Europe or northern, temperate Asia.

The first egg hatches after 31 to 36 days of incubation. The eggs hatch successively; although the average interval between egg-laying is 3 days, the young tend to hatch no more than a day or two apart. Like all owls that nest in the open, the downy young are often a mottled grey with some white and buff, which provides camouflage. They open their eyes at 4 days of age. The chicks grow rapidly, being able to consume small prey whole after roughly 3 weeks. In Andalusia, the most noticeable development of the young before they leave the nest was the increase of body size, which was the highest growth rate of any studied owl and faster than either snowy or great horned owls. Body mass increased fourteen times over from 5 days old to 60 days old in this study. The male continues to bring prey, leaving it on or around the nest, and the female feeds the nestlings, tearing up the food into suitably sized pieces. The female resumes hunting after about 3 weeks, which increases the food supply to the chicks. Many nesting attempts produce two fledglings, indicating that siblicide is not as common as in other birds of prey, especially a few species of eagles. In Spain, males are thought to be the first egg laid to reduce the likelihood of sibling aggression due to the size difference, thus the younger female hatchling is less likely to be killed since it is similar in size to its older sibling.

Apparently, the point at which the chicks venture out of the nest is driven by the location of the nest. In elevated nest sites, chicks usually wander out of the nest at 5 to as late as 7 weeks of age, but have been recorded leaving the nest if the nest is on the ground as early as 22 to 25 days old. The chicks can walk well at 5 weeks of age and by 7 weeks are taking short flights. Hunting and flying skills are not tested prior to the young eagle-owls leaving the nest. Young Eurasian eagle-owls leave the nest by 5–6 weeks of age and typically can be flying weakly (a few metres) by about 7–8 weeks of age. Normally, they are cared for at least another month. By the end of the month, the young eagle-owls are quite assured fliers. A few cases have been confirmed of adult eagle-owls in Spain feeding and caring for postfledgling juvenile eagle-owls that were not their own.
A study from southern France found the mean number of fledglings per nest was 1.67. In central Europe, the mean number of fledglings per nest was between 1.8 and 1.9. The mean fledgling rate in the Italian Alps was 1.89, thus being similar. In the Italian Alps, heavier rainfall during breeding decreased fledgling success because it inhibited the ability of the parents to hunt and potentially exposed nestlings to hypothermia. In the reintroduced population of eagle-owls in Eifel, Germany, occupied territories produced an average of 1.17 fledglings, but not all occupying pairs attempted to breed, with about 23% of those attempting to breed being unsuccessful. In slightly earlier studies, possibly due to higher persecution rates, the mean number of young leaving the nest was often lower, such as 1.77 in Bavaria, Germany, 1.1 in lower Austria, and 0.6 in southern Sweden. An experimental supplemental feeding program to young eagle-owls on two small Norwegian islands were found to increase mean numbers of fledglings from a mean of about 1.2 to 1.7 despite evidence that increased human activity near the nest decreased owlet survivability. While sibling owls are close in the stage between leaving the nest and fully fledged, about 20 days after leaving the nest, the family unit seems to dissolve and the young disperse quickly and directly. All told, the dependence of young eagle-owls on their parents lasts for 20 to 24 weeks. Independence in central Europe is from September to November. The young leave their parents&#x27; care normally on their own, but are also sometimes chased away by their parents. The young Eurasian eagle-owls reach sexual maturity by the following year, but do not normally breed until they can establish a territory at around 2–3 years old. Until they are able to establish their own territories, young eagle-owls spend their lives as nomadic &quot;floaters&quot;, and while they also call, select inconspicuous perch sites unlike breeding birds. Male floaters are especially wary about intrusion into an established territory to avoid potential conspecific aggression.

==Status==

The Eurasian eagle-owl has a very wide range across much of Europe and Asia, estimated to be about . In Europe, the population is estimated at 19,000 to 38,000 breeding pairs, and in the whole world around 250,000 to 2,500,000 individual birds. The population trend is thought to be decreasing because of human activities, but with such a large range and large total population, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the bird as being of least concern. Although roughly equal in adaptability and wideness of distribution, the great horned owl, with a total estimated population up to 5.3 million individuals, apparently has a total population that is roughly twice that of the Eurasian eagle-owl. Numerous factors, including a shorter history of systematic persecution, lesser sensitivity to human disturbance while nesting, somewhat greater ability to adapt to marginal habitats and widespread urbanization, and slightly smaller territories may play into the horned owls greater numbers in modern times. Eurasian eagle-owls are listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning international trade (including in parts and derivatives) is regulated.

===Longevity===
The Eurasian eagle-owl is one of the longest-living owls. It can live for up to 20 years in the wild. A 19-year-old was once considered the oldest ringed eagle-owl. Some studies posited that, in protected areas, lifespans ranging 15–20 years may not be uncommon. A record-breaking specimen, was banded in the wild and later encountered at the age of 27 years and 9 months. Like many other bird species, they can live much longer in captivity, where they don&#x27;t endure difficult natural conditions. They may have survived up to 68 years in zoo collections. Healthy adults normally have no natural predators, thus are considered apex predators. The leading causes of death are man-made: electrocution, traffic accidents, and shooting frequently claim the lives of eagle-owls.

===Anthropogenic mortality===
Electrocution was the greatest cause of mortality in 68% of 25 published studies, and accounted, on average, for 38.2% of the reported eagle-owl deaths. This was particularly true in the Italian Alps, where the number of dangerous, uninsulated pylons near nests was extremely high, but is highly problematic almost throughout the species&#x27; European distribution. In one telemetry study, 55% of 27 dispersing young were electrocuted within 1 year of their release from captivity, while electrocution rates of wild-born young are even higher. Mortality in the Swiss Rhine Valley was variable, in radio-tagged, released individuals, most died as a result of starvation (48%) rather than human-based causes, but 93% of the wild, untagged individuals found dead were due to human activities, 46% due to electrocution, and 43% due to collision with vehicles or trains. Insulation of pylons is thought to result in a stabilisation of the local population due to floaters taking up residence in unoccupied territories that formerly held deceased eagle-owls. Eurasian eagle-owls from Finland were found mainly to die due to electrocution (39%) and collisions with vehicles (22%). Wind turbine collisions can also be a serious cause of mortality locally.

Eagle-owls have been singled out historically as a threat to game species, thus to the economic well-being of landowners, game-keepers, and even governmental agencies, and as such, have been singled out for widespread persecution. Local extinctions of Eurasian eagle-owls have been primarily due to persecution. Examples of this include northern Germany in 1830, the Netherlands sometimes in the late 19th century, Luxembourg in 1903, Belgium in 1943, and central and western Germany in the 1960s. In trying to determine causes of death for 1476 eagle-owls from Spain, most were unknown and undetermined types of trauma. The largest group that could be determined, 411 birds, was due to collisions, more than half of which were from electrocution, while 313 were due to persecution, and merely 85 were directly attributable to natural causes. Clearly, while pylon safety is perhaps the most serious factor to be addressed in Spain, persecution continues to be a massive problem for Spanish eagle-owls. Of seven European nations where modern Eurasian eagle-owl mortality is well-studied, continual persecution is by far the largest problem in Spain, although also continues to be serious (often comprising at least half of studied mortality) in France. From France and Spain, nearly equal numbers of eagle-owls are poisoned (for which raptors might not be the main target), or shot intentionally.

===Conservation and reintroductions===

While the eagle-owl remains reasonably numerous in some parts of its habitat where nature is still relatively little disturbed by human activity, such as the sparsely populated regions of Russia and Scandinavia, concern has been expressed about the future of the Eurasian eagle-owl in Western and Central Europe. There, very few areas are not heavily modified by human civilisation, thus exposing the birds to the risk of collisions with deadly man-made objects (e.g. pylons) and a depletion of native prey numbers due to ongoing habitat degradation and urbanisation.

In Spain, long-term governmental protection of the Eurasian eagle-owl seems to have no positive effect on reducing the persecution of eagle-owls. Therefore, Spanish conservationists have recommended to boost education and stewardship programs to protect eagle-owls from direct killing by local residents. Unanimously, biologists studying eagle-owl mortality and conservation factors have recommended to proceed with the proper insulation of electric wires and pylons in areas where the species is present. As this measure is labour-intensive and therefore rather expensive, few efforts have actually been made to insulate pylons in areas with few fiscal resources devoted to conservation such as rural Spain. In Sweden, a mitigation project was launched to insulate transformers that are frequently damaged by eagle-owl electrocution.

Large reintroduction programs were instituted in Germany after the eagle-owl was deemed extinct in the country as a breeding species by the 1960s, as a result of a long period of heavy persecution. The largest reintroduction there occurred from the 1970s to the 1990s in the Eifel region, near the border with Belgium and Luxembourg. The success of this measure, consisting in more than a thousand eagle-owls being reintroduced at an average cost of US$1,500 per bird, is a subject of controversy. Those eagle-owls reintroduced in the Eifel region appear to be able to breed successfully, and enjoy nesting success comparable with wild eagle-owls from elsewhere in Europe. Mortality levels in the Eifel region, though, appear to remain quite high due to anthropogenic factors. Also, concerns exist about a lack of genetic diversity of the species in this part of Germany. Apparently, the German reintroductions have allowed eagle-owls to repopulate neighbouring parts of Europe, as the breeding populations now occurring in the Low Countries (the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg) are believed to be the result of influx from regions further to the east. Smaller reintroductions have been done elsewhere, and the current breeding population in Sweden is believed to be primarily the result of a series of reintroductions. Conversely to numerous threats and declines incurred by Eurasian eagle-owls, areas where human-dependent, non-native prey species such as brown rats (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;) and rock doves (&quot;Columba livia&quot;) have flourished, have given the eagle-owls a primary food source and allowed them occupy regions where they were once marginalized or absent.

===Occurrence in Great Britain===
The Eurasian eagle-owl at one time occurred naturally in Great Britain. Some, including the RSPB, have claimed that it had disappeared about 10,000–9,000 years ago, after the last ice age, but fossil remains found in Meare Lake Village indicate the eagle-owl occurring as recently as roughly 2,000 years ago in the fossil record. The lack of presence of the Eurasian eagle-owl in British folklore or writings in recent millennium may indicate the lack of occurrence by this species there. The flooding of the land bridge between Britain and continental Europe may have been responsible for their extirpation as they only disperse over limited distances, although early human persecution presumably played a role as well. Some reportages of eagle-owls in Britain have been revealed to actually be great horned owls or Indian eagle-owls, the latter a particularly popular owl in falconry circuits. Some breeding pairs do still occur in Britain, though the exact number of pairs and individuals is not definitely known. The World Owl Trust stated that they believe some eagle-owls occurring in North England and Scotland are naturally occurring, making the flight of roughly from the west coast of Norway to Shetland and the east coast of Scotland, as well as possibly from the coasts of the Netherlands and Belgium to the south. Although not migratory, eagle-owls can disperse some notable distances in young birds seeking a territory.

Prior studies of eagle-owl distribution have indicated a strong reluctance to cross large bodies of water in the species. Many authorities state that the Eurasian eagle-owls occurring in Britain are individuals that have escaped from captivity. While, until the 19th century, wealthy collectors may have released unwanted eagle-owls, despite press to the contrary, no evidence of any organization or individual intentionally releasing eagle-owls recently with the intent to establish a breeding population has been found. Many feel that the eagle-owl would be classified as an &quot;alien&quot; species. Due to its predatory abilities, many, especially those in the press, have expressed alarm of their effect on &quot;native&quot; species. From 1994 to 2007, 73 escaped eagle-owls were not registered as returned, while 50 escapees were recaptured. Several recorded breeding attempts have been studied, and most were unsuccessful, due in large part to incidental disturbance by humans and some due to direct persecution, with eggs having been smashed.

===Effect on conservation-dependent species===
As highly opportunistic predators, Eurasian eagle-owls hunt almost any appropriately sized prey they encounter. Most often, they take whatever prey is locally common and can take a large number of species considered harmful to human financial interests, such as rats, mice, and pigeons. Eurasian eagle-owls do take rare or endangered species, as well. Among the species considered at least vulnerable (up to critically endangered as in the mink and eel, both heavily overexploited by humans) to extinction known to be hunted by Eurasian eagle-owls are Russian desman (&quot;Desmana moschata&quot;) Pyrenean desman (&quot;Galemys pyrenaicus&quot;), barbastelle (&quot;Barbastella barbastellus&quot;), European ground squirrel (&quot;Spermophilus citellus&quot;), southwestern water vole (&quot;Arvicola sapidus&quot;), European mink (&quot;Mustela lutreola&quot;), marbled polecat (&quot;Vormela peregusna&quot;), lesser white-fronted goose (&quot;Anser erythrops&quot;), Egyptian vulture (&quot;Neophron percnopterus&quot;), greater spotted eagle (&quot;Clanga clanga&quot;), eastern imperial eagle (&quot;Aquila heliaca&quot;), saker falcon (&quot;Falco cherrug&quot;), houbara bustard (&quot;Chlamydotis undulata&quot;), great bustard (&quot;Otis tarda&quot;), spur-thighed tortoise (&quot;Testudo graeca&quot;), Atlantic cod (&quot;Gadus morhua&quot;), European eel (&quot;Anguilla anguilla&quot;) and lumpfish (&quot;Cyclopterus lumpus&quot;).

<doc id="200249" wikidata="Q4411" url="?curid=200249" title="Battle of Valmy">
<text>The Battle of Valmy, also known as the Cannonade of Valmy, was the first major victory by the army of France during the Revolutionary Wars that followed the French Revolution. The battle took place on 20 September 1792 as Prussian troops commanded by the Duke of Brunswick attempted to march on Paris. Generals François Kellermann and Charles Dumouriez stopped the advance near the northern village of Valmy in Champagne-Ardenne.

In this early part of the Revolutionary Wars—known as the War of the First Coalition—the new French government was in almost every way unproven, and thus the small, localized victory at Valmy became a huge psychological victory for the Revolution at large. The outcome was thoroughly unexpected by contemporary observers—a vindication for the French revolutionaries and a stunning defeat for the vaunted Prussian army. The victory emboldened the newly assembled National Convention to formally declare the end of monarchy in France and to establish the French Republic. Valmy permitted the development of the Revolution and all its resultant ripple effects, and for that it is regarded by historians as one of the most significant battles in history.

==Background==
As the French Revolution continued, the monarchies of Europe became concerned that revolutionary fervor would spread to their countries. The War of the First Coalition was an effort to stop the revolution, or at least contain it to France. King Frederick William II of Prussia had the support of Great Britain and the Austrian Empire to send the Duke of Brunswick towards Paris with a large army. In the war&#x27;s early encounters of mid-1792, French troops did not distinguish themselves, and enemy forces advanced dangerously deep into France intending to pacify the country, restore the traditional monarchy, and end the Revolution. The French commander Charles Dumouriez, meanwhile, had been marching his army northeast to attack the Austrian Netherlands, but this plan was abandoned because of the more immediate threat to Paris. A second army under General François Kellermann was ordered to link up with him in a mutual defense.

Just over half of the French infantry were regulars of the old Royal Army, as were nearly all of the cavalry and, most importantly, the artillery, which were widely regarded as the best in Europe at the time. These veterans provided a professional core to steady the enthusiastic volunteer battalions. Combined, Dumouriez&#x27; Army of the North and Kellermann&#x27;s Army of the Centre totalled approximately 54,000 troops. Heading towards them was Brunswick&#x27;s coalition army of about 84,000, drilled Prussian and Austrian troops augmented by large complements of Hessians and emigres of the French royalist Army of Condé.

==Battle==

The invading army handily captured Longwy on 23 August and Verdun on 2 September, then moved on toward Paris through the defiles of the Forest of Argonne. In response, Dumouriez halted his advance to the Netherlands and reversed course, approaching the enemy army from its rear. From Metz, Kellermann moved to his assistance, joining him at the village of Sainte-Menehould on 19 September.
The French forces were now east of the Prussians, behind their lines. Theoretically the Prussians could have marched straight towards Paris unopposed, but this course was never seriously considered: the threat to their lines of supply and communication was too great to be ignored. The unfavorable situation was compounded by bad weather and an alarming increase in sickness among the troops. With few other options available, Brunswick turned back and prepared to do battle.

The troops trudged laboriously through a heavy downpour—&quot;rain as of the days of Noah&quot;, in the words of Thomas Carlyle. Brunswick headed through the northern woods believing he could cut off Dumouriez. At the moment when the Prussian manœuvre was nearly completed, Kellermann advanced his left wing and took up a position on the slopes between Sainte-Menehould and Valmy. He centered his command around an old windmill, which he quickly razed to prevent enemy artillery spotters from using it as a sighting location. His veteran artillerists were well-placed upon its accommodating ridge to begin the so-called &quot;Cannonade of Valmy&quot;. Brunswick moved toward them with about 34,000 of his troops. As they emerged from the woods, a long-range gunnery duel ensued and the French batteries proved superior. The Prussian infantry made a cautious, and fruitless, effort to advance under fire across the open ground.
As the Prussians wavered, a pivotal moment was reached when Kellermann raised his hat and made his famous cry of &quot;Vive la Nation&quot;. The cry was repeated again and again by all the French army, and had a crushing effect upon Prussian morale. The French troops sang &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; and &quot;Ça Ira&quot;, and a cheer went up from the French line. To the surprise of nearly everyone, Brunswick broke off the action and retired from the field. The Prussians rounded the French positions at a great distance and commenced a rapid retreat eastward. The two engaged forces had been essentially equal in size, Kellermann with approximately 36,000 troops and 40 cannon, and Brunswick with 34,000 and 54 cannon. Yet by the time Brunswick retreated, casualties had risen no higher than three hundred French and two hundred Prussians.

===Prussian retreat===
The precipitous end to the action provoked elation among the French. The question of exactly why the Prussians withdrew has never been definitively answered. Most historians ascribe the retreat to some combination of the following factors: the highly defensible French position together with the rapidly growing numbers of reinforcements and citizen volunteers with their discouraging and thoroughly unexpected &quot;élan&quot; which persuaded the cautious Brunswick to spare himself a dangerous loss of manpower, particularly when the Russian invasion of Poland had already raised concerns for Prussia&#x27;s defensibility in the east. Others have put forward more shadowy motives for the decision, including a secret plea by Louis XVI to avoid an action which might cost him his life, and even bribery of the Prussians, allegedly paid for with the Bourbon crown jewels. 

An analysis by Munro Price, reader in history at the University of Bradford and a modern specialist in this period, concludes that there is no convincing proof of bribery turning back the Prussians. The more likely explanation remains that, having initially adopted an aggressive strategy, Brunswick lacked the will to carry it through when confronted by an unexpectedly determined and disciplined opposition. Brunswick had actually been offered command of the French armies prior to the outbreak of war and émigré factions subsequently used this as a basis to allege treachery on his part. In any case, the battle ended decisively, the French pursuit was not seriously pressed, and Brunswick&#x27;s troops managed a safe if inglorious eastward retreat.

==Aftermath==

This engagement was the turning point of the Prussians&#x27; campaign. Beset with food shortages and dysentery, their retreat continued well past the Rhine River. French troops soon struck forward into Germany, taking Mainz in October. Dumouriez once again moved against the Austrian Netherlands and Kellermann ably secured the front at Metz.

Dumouriez would bear a harsh change of fortune: after one more influential success in November 1792 at Jemappes, he was by the following year a broken man. His army had suffered such catastrophic losses that he defected to the royalist side for the rest of his life. Kellermann, however, continued in a long and distinguished military career. In 1808 he was ennobled by Napoleon and became Duke of Valmy.

==Legacy==
In terms of military history the battle introduced features that reshaped modern warfare. It exemplified key components of &quot;total war&quot; in terms of political propaganda, psychological warfare, and eager participation of large numbers of politicized civilians. 

After a while the battle came to be celebrated as the first great victory of the armies of the French Revolution. In the varied historiography of the French Revolution, it is typically portrayed as the first victory of a citizen army, inspired by liberty and nationalism. Many thousands of volunteers did indeed swell the ranks, but at least half of the French forces were professional soldiers, particularly among Kellermann&#x27;s critical artillery units. The French artillery also held a tactical advantage in its modern Gribeauval gun system which proved highly successful on the battlefield. But in popular conception, Valmy was a victory of citizen-soldiers: the battle was emblemized by Kellermann&#x27;s cry, augmented by the troops&#x27; singing of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; and the &quot;Ça Ira&quot; while under fire.

On the day of the battle, the Legislative Assembly had duly transferred its power to the National Convention.
Over the next two days, flush with the news from Valmy, the new Convention deputies abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the French Republic. The victory was a much-needed source of pride for the revolutionary French state, and provided enduring inspiration for the years that followed. It was considered by many contemporaries to be a miraculous event for France, and a &quot;decisive defeat&quot; for one of the most effective armies in Europe. Scholars continue to count it among the most significant clashes in military history.

The Prussians themselves recognized the importance of the battle, not merely as a setback in the war but as a crucial advancement for the Revolution as a whole. The German writer and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who was present at the battle with the Prussian army, later wrote that he was approached by some of his comrades in a state of dejection. He had previously cheered them up with memorable and clever quotes but his only consolation this time was, &quot;Here and today, a new epoch in the history of the world has begun, and you can boast you were present at its birth.&quot;

<doc id="200250" wikidata="Q315565" url="?curid=200250" title="Kiichi Miyazawa">
<text>was a Japanese politician who served as prime minister of Japan from 1991 to 1993.

Born in Tokyo, Miyazawa graduated from Tokyo Imperial University with a law degree, and in 1942 joined the Ministry of Finance. He was first elected to the National Diet in 1953 and held a number of prominent posts, including international trade and industry minister under Eisaku Sato, foreign minister under Takeo Miki, director of the Economic Planning Agency under Takeo Fukuda, chief cabinet secretary under Yasuhiro Nakasone, and finance minister under Noboru Takeshita. Miyazawa became prime minister in 1991, but was forced to resign after the 1993 election after a failure to pass political reforms caused his Liberal Democratic Party to face its first defeat in a national election since its formation in 1955. Miyazawa later returned as finance minister from 1999 to 2002 in the cabinets of Keizō Obuchi and Yoshirō Mori.

==Early life and education==
Miyazawa was born into a wealthy, politically active family from Fukuyama, Hiroshima, on 8 October 1919, as the eldest son of politician and his wife Koto. His father was a member of the Diet, and his mother was the daughter of politician , who served as Minister of Justice and Minister of Railways. Following the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, Miyazawa lived at his grandfather Ogawa Heikichi&#x27;s villa Kasuian in Hiratsuka. At the time, his father Yutaka worked for Yamashita Kisen, whilst planning to move his political career from Hiroshima Prefecture to the National Diet. 

Miyazawa studied at Musashi Higher School, then went on to study at the Faculty of Law, Tokyo Imperial University. While at university, Miyazawa travelled to attend the Japan-America Student Conference in Washington D.C. in the United States in 1939, just before the outbreak of the Second World War. Inspired by this experience, he kept learning English even during the time the country was at war with the US, and became a fluent speaker. Apart from his studies, he was passionate about Noh, films and music.

==Career==
In 1942, Miyazawa joined the Ministry of Finance, avoiding military service during World War II. While in the Ministry, he became a protégé of future prime minister Hayato Ikeda.

In 1953, at Ikeda&#x27;s urging, Miyazawa ran for and won election to the Upper House of the National Diet, where he remained until moving to the Lower House in 1967. As a leading figure in Ikeda&#x27;s Kōchikai policy group, Miyazawa was considered a member of Ikeda&#x27;s &quot;brains trust.&quot; In 1961, Miyazawa accompanied Ikeda to a summit meeting with U.S. President John F. Kennedy, and due to his excellent English, served as Ikeda&#x27;s sole translator during the latter&#x27;s &quot;yacht talks&quot; with Kennedy on Kennedy&#x27;s presidential yacht, the &quot;Honey Fitz.&quot;

Beginning with the Ikeda cabinet, Miyazawa held a number of important government posts, including Director of the Economic Planning Agency (1962-64, 1966-68, 1977-78), Minister of International Trade and Industry (1970–1971), Minister of Foreign Affairs (1974–1976), and Chief Cabinet Secretary (1984–1986). He became Minister of Finance under the government of Noboru Takeshita in July 1986. However, Miyazawa had to resign from this post amid the Recruit scandal in 1988.

==Prime minister==
Miyazawa became Prime Minister on 5 November 1991 backed by his faction. Miyazawa gained brief fame in the United States when President George H. W. Bush vomited in his lap and fainted during a state dinner on 8 January 1992.

In 1992, while he was in South Korea, he formally apologized for Japan&#x27;s use of comfort women, making him the first Japanese leader to acknowledge that Japan&#x27;s military coerced women into sexual slavery before and during the Second World War.

His government passed a law allowing Japan to send its forces overseas for peacekeeping missions as well as negotiating a trade agreement with the United States. It also introduced financial reforms to address the growing economic malaise in Japan in the 1990s. Miyazawa resigned in 1993 after losing a vote of no confidence marking an end to 38 years of Liberal Democratic Party government. The reason for the vote was a scandal involving Fumio Abe, a member of Miyazawa&#x27;s faction. The Liberal Democratic Party returned to power in June 1994.

==Subsequent career==

Miyazawa later returned to frontbench politics when he was once again appointed finance minister from 1998 to 2001 in the governments of Keizō Obuchi and Yoshirō Mori. In 1998, Miyazawa replaced Hikaru Matsunaga as finance minister. 
He served a total of 14 terms in both upper and lower houses before retiring from politics in 2003. The reason for his retirement was that then prime minister Junichiro Koizumi set an age limit of 73 for LDP political candidates.

==Personal life==
Miyazawa married while studying in the United States. He and his wife, Yoko, had two children: Hiro, an architect, and Keiko, who became wife of diplomat . He published a book, entitled &quot;Secret Talks Between Tokyo and Washington&quot;, which was translated into English by Robert D. Eldridge in 2007. The book is about Miyazawa&#x27;s views concerning the relationships between the US and Japan in terms of the political, economic, and security-related negotiations during the period of 1949 and 1954.

==Death==
Miyazawa died in Tokyo at the age of 87 on 28 June 2007.

* Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun of Peru (1992)

<doc id="200252" wikidata="Q315555" url="?curid=200252" title="Morihiro Hosokawa">
<text>is a Japanese politician who served as prime minister of Japan from 1993 to 1994. He led an eight-party coalition government which was the first Japanese government not headed by a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) premier since 1955.

Born to a prominent family in Kumamoto Prefecture, Hosokawa is a grandson of Prince Fumimaro Konoe. He graduated from Sophia University before working at the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; newspaper, and was elected to the National Diet in 1971 before leaving to serve as governor of his home prefecture from 1983 to 1991. In 1992, Hosokawa left the LDP to found the reformist Japan New Party, which won 35 seats in the 1993 general election. The LDP lost its governing majority, which was replaced by an eight-party coalition led by Hosokawa. He initiated electoral reforms before Tsutomu Hata&#x27;s Japan Renewal Party took over leadership of the coalition in 1994. Hosokawa joined the New Frontier Party in 1996 and Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) in 1998 before retiring from politics. He unsuccessfully ran for Governor of Tokyo in 2014. Since 2005, he has been the head of the Kumamoto-Hosokawa clan, one of Japan&#x27;s former noble families.

== Early life ==
Morihiro Hosokawa was born in Tokyo as the eldest grandson of Moritatsu, 3rd Marquess Hosokawa, and head of the Hosokawa clan. His maternal grandfather is the former prime minister Prince Fumimaro Konoe (1937–1939, 1940–1941). As a great-great-grandson of Prince Kuni Asahiko, he is a third cousin of the present emperor, Naruhito. He is also a descendant of Christian heroine Gracia Hosokawa.

Hosokawa received his LL.B. degree from Sophia University in 1961. After working for the newspaper &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; as journalist for five years, he made an unsuccessful run in the 1969 general election. He was elected to the House of Councillors of Japan as an LDP representative of Kumamoto Prefecture in 1971, with his campaign funded by party boss Kakuei Tanaka.

After serving two terms in the National Diet, Hosokawa left in 1983 to become the governor of Kumamoto, where he served until 1991. During his term as governor, he complained about the powerful bureaucracy of the central government. Hosokawa pursued an aggressive economic policy and strengthened environmental laws. In May 1992, an ongoing campaign contribution scandal inspired him to form the reformist Japan New Party (JNP), which won four seats (one of which Hosokawa assumed) in the 1992 House of Councillors election.

== Prime minister ==

In the July 1993 general election, in a change very few had foreseen even a year earlier, the LDP lost its majority in the Diet for the first time in thirty-eight years, winning only 223 out of 511 seats in the House of Representatives. The previous LDP government of Kiichi Miyazawa was replaced by an eight-party coalition government which promised a series of social, political, and economic reforms. Excluding the JCP, the coalition was backed by all of the former opposition parties, which included the newly formed JNP, the Japan Socialist Party, the Japan Renewal Party (Shinseito), Komeito, the Democratic Socialist Party, the Socialist Democratic Federation, the RENGO and the New Party Sakigake, who together controlled 243 seats in the House of Representatives. Hosokawa, one of the major voices in forming the coalition, was chosen as the new Prime Minister.

Walter Mondale, then the US ambassador to Japan, characterized Hosokawa as having a &quot;Kennedy-esque&quot; ability to focus on ideals; nonetheless, Hosokawa&#x27;s coalition had no common ideas other than their opposition to the LDP, which undermined Hosokawa throughout his term as prime minister. He was also at odds with Japan&#x27;s bureaucracy, which he sought to reform after decades of bureaucratic entrenchment under the LDP.

===Foreign policy===
Hosokawa made several unprecedented moves toward atonement with Japan&#x27;s Asian neighbors during his term as prime minister. In his first news conference in office, he made an unprecedented statement acknowledging that Japan waged a war of aggression in World War II.

Hosokawa later said: &quot;You can obviously define &#x27;aggression&#x27; in any number of ways, depending on context. But if you have any common sense, you just cannot say in good conscience that Japan was not the aggressor when Japan did in fact cause tremendous anguish and loss of life in China, Korea and Southeast Asian nations in order to protect its own interests. I knew my opinion was going to invite heated controversy.&quot;

On 6 November 1993, he visited South Korea, where he had a summit with President Kim Young-sam in Gyeongju and again offered a clear apology to the Korean people for Japan&#x27;s actions in the war, statements which were widely applauded in Korea. Hosokawa viewed the Japanese annexation of Korea as wrong and rejected the right-wing view in Japan that it was with Korea&#x27;s consent and was beneficial to Korea. On 19 March 1994, he visited China, and the two governments signed an agreement of cooperation in environmental protection.

In May 1994, right-wing extremist Masakatsu Nozoe fired a gunshot into the ceiling of a Tokyo hotel where Hosokawa was giving a speech, in apparent protest at Hosokawa&#x27;s statements.

Hosokawa&#x27;s acts toward China and Korea inspired Russian president Boris Yeltsin to apologize to Hosokawa for the Soviet detention of Japanese prisoners of war in Siberia. Hosokawa later speculated that if both men had remained in office longer Russian-Japanese relations would have improved significantly. Hosokawa also had a good personal relationship with Bill Clinton, but trade disputes between Japan and the United States dominated US-Japan relations during Hosokawa&#x27;s tenure.

===Domestic policy===

The Hosokawa government pushed for changes to Japanese election laws intended to fight political corruption, including elimination of corporate political donations to individual candidates and a redrawing of the electoral system, both intended to prevent the LDP from continuing to employ its past electoral practices. After an extended legislative fight, the LDP was able to force several concessions to maintain their advantage, retaining corporate political donations with a cap, while pushing back on some more radical changes to the electoral map and ensuring that most candidates would keep essentially the same seats in the next election. These compromises had a negative impact on the public approval of the Hosokawa coalition.

A law of December 1993 amending the Basic Law on measures for physically and mentally disabled persons of 1970 aimed to promote the independence of disabled people and their participation in activities in any field such as culture, the economy, and community affairs. Amendments made to regulations under the Industrial Safety and Health Law of 1972 on 30 March 1994 included accidents involving the collapsing of cranes and breaking of wires that needed to be reported to the authorities. On 1 April 1994, a 40-hour workweek was introduced.

Hosokawa also enacted cuts in income and resident taxes, intended to help Japan out of the recession that had followed the Japanese asset price bubble of the late 1980s and early 1990s. After pressure from the finance ministry, the government compensated for these cuts by announcing an increase in the consumption tax from 3% to 7%, effective from 1997. The move was controversial within the cabinet, as Ichiro Ozawa favored a 10% rate while the Japan Socialist Party would not agree to an increase. Hosokawa announced the increase but retracted the announcement the next day, leaving the tax at 3%. The government&#x27;s response to the issue weakened its hold on power and was said to hasten its demise. The tax was eventually increased to 5% in 1997 by LDP Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.

===Resignation===

Hosokawa was forced to resign in April 1994 after it came to light that he had accepted a 100-million-yen loan from a trucking company previously accused of bribery and links to organized crime. Amid allegations of bribery, Hosokawa argued that the money was a loan and produced a receipt to show that he had paid it back; LDP members passed around a copy remarking that it looked like a fake. Although Hosokawa still had high public approval at the time, opinion was growing that he could not meet the expectations set at the start of his term.

Hosokawa&#x27;s resignation was abrupt and led to a number of frenzied meetings aimed at saving the coalition, which was torn between the rival camps of Ichiro Ozawa and Masayoshi Takemura. After his resignation, the coalition was taken over by the Shinseito president Tsutomu Hata.

===Cabinet===
The Hosokawa cabinet was a product of his multi-party coalition but was dominated by individuals viewed as conservatives. Its key ministers were members of the Shinseito party led by Ichiro Ozawa. Hosokawa&#x27;s own Japan New Party had no other representatives in the cabinet.


== Later political life ==

Hosokawa joined the New Frontier Party in 1994 but, following further disputes with Ichiro Ozawa, left in 1997 with four other legislators who formed the short-lived From Five party. In 1998, From Five merged into the Good Governance Party, which itself merged into the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) later that year.

After the LDP returned to power in 1994, Hosokawa teamed up with Junichiro Koizumi of the LDP and Shusei Tanaka of New Party Sakigake in a strategic dialogue across party lines regarding Japan becoming a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Although this idea was not popular within the LDP and never came to fruition, Hosokawa and Koizumi maintained a close working relationship in subsequent years. Hosokawa tacitly served as Koizumi&#x27;s personal envoy to China at times of strained Sino-Japanese relations during Koizumi&#x27;s term as prime minister from 2001 to 2006.

Hosokawa retired from politics in 1998 at the age of 60. In his retirement, he took up pottery, studying intensively for 18 months under pottery master Shiro Tsujimura. Hosokawa&#x27;s pottery has been exhibited in Japan and Europe. He uses his pottery for tea ceremonies at a tea house originally constructed for a visit by Jacques Chirac, which was cancelled due to the outbreak of the Iraq War. He is also a special consultant to &quot;The Japan Times&quot;. Upon his father&#x27;s death in 2005, Hosokawa succeeded him as the head of the Hosokawa family.

==Tokyo gubernatorial bid==

In 2014, at the age of 75, Hosokawa was approached by the DPJ to run in the Tokyo gubernatorial election. Although Hosokawa initially turned down their request, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi encouraged him to run for the primary purpose of gathering public opposition to Prime Minister Shinzō Abe&#x27;s pro-nuclear policies, and Hosokawa again considered running for the office. This was initially perceived as a blow to Yōichi Masuzoe, the LDP-supported candidate who was also supported by elements within the DPJ and who had previously been considered the lone front-runner in the race; the race between Masuzoe and Hosokawa became widely dubbed as a &quot;proxy contest&quot; between Abe and Koizumi.

Hosokawa announced his candidacy alongside Koizumi on January 14. His campaign was supported by several key members of his 1993-94 coalition: Banri Kaieda and Ichirō Ozawa, who had since become the heads of the Democratic Party of Japan and People&#x27;s Life Party respectively, threw their support behind Hosokawa, while Shusei Tanaka and Yoriko Madoka were enlisted as his policy advisors.

During his campaign, Hosokawa criticized the Abe government&#x27;s nuclear policy, stating: &quot;Tokyo is shoving nuclear power plants and nuclear waste to other regions, while enjoying the convenience (of electricity) as a big consumer.&quot; He also criticized Abe&#x27;s foreign policy in the run-up to the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, questioning &quot;whether pugnacious diplomacy will help the festival of peace to be held smoothly.&quot;

Hosokawa failed to gain momentum and trailed behind Masuzoe in the polls through the final week of the campaign, with only a 30–40% support rating within the DPJ and PLP and particularly low support among women. Masuzoe was declared the winner in exit polls shortly after voting ended on February 9, but Hosokawa vowed to continue anti-nuclear advocacy.

== Personal life ==
Hosokawa lives in Yugawara, Kanagawa. His wife, Kayoko Hosokawa, to whom he has been married since 23 October 1971, served as honorary chair of the Special Olympics Nippon Foundation and headed NPOs devoted to providing vaccines to children in developing nations and helping the intellectually disabled. He and Kayoko have three children: Morimitsu, Satoko and Yūko.

<doc id="200253" wikidata="Q315720" url="?curid=200253" title="Tsutomu Hata">
<text>was a Japanese politician who briefly served as prime minister of Japan in 1994.

Born in Tokyo, Hata graduated from Seijo University and was first elected to the National Diet in 1969. He rose to become a key member of the Liberal Democratic Party&#x27;s Tanaka/Takeshita faction, and served as agriculture, forests, and fisheries minister in the 1980s and finance minister from 1991 to 1992. After Keizō Obuchi took over the faction, Hata formed the Japan Renewal Party in 1993, which joined in the anti-LDP coalition which formed Morihiro Hosokawa&#x27;s government. Hata served as foreign minister, then replaced Hosokawa as prime minister when he resigned. However, the Japan Socialist Party soon left the coalition, causing it to collapse. Hata lost leadership of his party when it merged with the New Frontier Party, then formed his own Sun Party, which in turn merged with the Good Governance Party then Democratic Party in 1998. Hata became secretary-general of the party, and remained one of its senior advisors until his death.

==Early years==
Hata was born in Tokyo on 24 August 1935, a son of the Liberal Democratic Party Member of Parliament Bushiro Hata. Hata graduated from Seijo University and was employed by the Odakyu bus company from 1958 to 1969.

==Political career==
In 1969, Hata entered the House of Representatives of Japan, representing Nagano Prefecture as a member of the Liberal Democratic Party. He rose to become a top lieutenant in the Tanaka/Takeshita faction in the 1980s.

In 1991, he served as Minister of Finance under Kiichi Miyazawa. He left the LDP in 1993 to found the Japan Renewal Party with longtime LDP ally Ichirō Ozawa, which became part of Morihiro Hosokawa&#x27;s anti-LDP coalition government later that year. Hata served as foreign minister in the Hosokawa cabinet.

On 28 April 1994, Hosokawa resigned and Hata became prime minister. However, the Japan Socialist Party had recently left the coalition, destroying its majority in the Diet. Rather than face a vote of no confidence, Hata elected to resign in June, allowing SDP leader Tomiichi Murayama to take over the position on 30 June.

A number of progressive reforms were introduced during Hata&#x27;s tenure as prime minister. A law passed on 17 June 1994 to amend the Law concerning Stabilization of Employment for Older Persons aimed to encourage employers to plan continuous employment for older employees after the age of 60, as well as to prohibit employers from setting a compulsory retirement age lower than 60 and appoint public corporations as centres &quot;for the practical use of older workers&#x27; experience.&quot; On 22 June 1994, the Support Centre for Employment of the Disabled was established by law to provide practical advice, vocational training, and information to disabled workers and employers. A health insurance amendment law passed on 29 June 1994 exempted employees from the requirement to pay National Health Insurance fees during child-care leave.

After the Shinseito merged into the Shinshinto in late 1994, Hata contested the leadership against Ichiro Ozawa. After losing this contest, he and twelve other Diet members formed the splinter Sun Party (太陽党 Taiyōtō). The Sun Party in January 1998 became a part of the Good Governance Party which itself was subsumed by the 
Democratic Party of Japan in April 1998.

==Personal life and death ==
Hata&#x27;s son, Yuichiro (1967–2020), was a member of the House of Councillors of Japan. He was appointed the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism on 4 June 2012. Tsutomu &quot;Too Hot&quot; Hata is recognized as the godfather of the Hacket, a short sleeve blazer which he also coined as an &quot;E-cool suit&quot;. Hata was ahead of his time in this regard and concern for sensible sustainable fashion.

Hata died of natural causes on 28 August 2017 in Tokyo, four days after his 82nd birthday.

==Honours==
** Grand Cordon of the Order of the Paulownia Flowers (29 April 2013)
** Grand Cross of the Order of Prince Henry (2 December 1993)

<text>William Quan Judge (April 13, 1851 – March 21, 1896) was an Irish-American mystic, esotericist, and occultist, and one of the founders of the original Theosophical Society.

==Biography==
Judge was born in Dublin, Ireland. When he was 13 years old, his family emigrated to the United States. He became a naturalized citizen of the US at age 21 and passed the New York state bar exam, specializing in commercial law.

Judge was one of the seventeen co-founders of the Theosophical Society. Like Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and Henry Steel Olcott, he stayed in the organization when others left. When Olcott and Blavatsky left the United States for India, he stayed behind to manage the Society&#x27;s work, all the while working as a lawyer.

When Blavatsky and Olcott left America, they left Theosophy in North America in Judge&#x27;s hands. While Judge kept in close contact with both Blavatsky and Olcott through correspondence, there was little if any organized activity for the next several years. His difficulties over this period of time are illustrated by a biographical passage written by Julia van der Planck (the wife of Archibald Keightley): &quot;It was a time when Madame Blavatsky – she who was then the one great exponent, had left the field ... the interest excited by her ... striking mission had died down. The T.S. was henceforth to subsist on its philosophical basis ... From his twenty-third year until his death, [Judge&#x27;s] best efforts and all the fiery energies of his undaunted soul were given to this work.&quot;

In 1876, business affairs caused him to visit South America, where he contracted &quot;Chagres fever&quot;, and he was ever after a sufferer from the disease. Other &quot;phases&quot; of his experiences on this journey are recorded in his writings, often allegorical, suggesting the character of the occult contacts which may have been established on this journey.

In India, Blavatsky established a new headquarters. As a European, her efforts to restore respect for the Hindu faith were quite effective. As a result, she made enemies among the missionaries of Christianity. &quot;The Theosophical Movement 1875–1950&quot; sets out some of the events that followed: &quot;William Q. Judge, who arrived in India soon after the Coulombs had been sent away from headquarters, made a detailed examination of the false door constructed in Madam Blavatsky&#x27;s &#x27;occult room&#x27;. He showed the product of Coulomb&#x27;s interrupted labours to some three hundred witnesses who signed their names to a description of the place. He removed the &#x27;shrine&#x27; in which the Coulombs had attempted to plant evidence of fraud. These actions provide evidence of &#x27;the Coulomb Conspiracy&#x27; and vindicate Madame Blavatsky.&quot;

In 1885, after his return to America, Judge set about to revitalize the movement in the United States. The real beginning of the work of Theosophy in the United States began in 1886, when Judge established &quot;The Path&quot;, an independent Theosophical magazine. Until this time, not much had been accomplished in the way of growth of the Society in America. Judge&#x27;s interest in the welfare of others affected his work, so that his articles and Theosophical talks addressed the common people in homely language and with simple reason. In his first editorial, he wrote:It is not thought that utopia can be established in a day ... Certainly, if we all say that it is useless ... nothing will ever be done. A beginning must be made and it has been made by the Theosophical society ... Riches are accumulating in the hands of the few while the poor are ground harder every day as they increase in number ... All this points unerringly to a vital error somewhere ... What is wanted is true knowledge of the spiritual condition of man, his aim, and destiny ... those who must begin the reform are those who are so fortunate as to be placed in the world where they can see and think out the problems all are endeavouring to solve, even if they know that the great day may not come until after their death.

He also wrote:The Christian nations have dazzled themselves with a baneful glitter of material progress. They are not the peoples who will furnish the clearest clues to the Path ... The Grand Clock of the Universe points to another hour, and now Man must seize the key in his hands and himself – as a whole – open the gate ... Our practice consists in a disregard of any authority in matters of religion and philosophy except such propositions as from their innate quality we feel to be true.

It has been said of Judge: &quot;Everything he wrote of a metaphysical nature can be found, directly or indirectly, in the works of Madame Blavatsky. He attempted no new &quot;revelation&quot; but illustrated in his own works the ideal use of the concepts of the Theosophical Teachings.&quot; Over the years, Judge attracted to the Movement a nucleus of devoted followers. The movement grew steadily in America.

Judge wrote theosophical articles for various theosophical magazines, and also the introductory volume, &quot;The Ocean of Theosophy&quot; in 1893. He became the General Secretary of the American Section of the Theosophical Society in 1884, with Abner Doubleday as president.

Judge left no record of the period before the founding of the Theosophical Society but some of his published statements reveal the character of his relationship with Blavatsky during this period. On the occasion of her death in 1891, he referred to their first meeting in her rooms in January 1875. He wrote:

It was her eye that attracted me, the eye of one whom I must have known in lives long passed away. She looked at me in recognition for that first hour, and never since has that look changed. Not as a questioner of philosophies did I come before her, not as one groping in the dark for lights that schools and fanciful theories had obscured, but as one who, wandering through the corridors of life, was seeking the friends who could show where the designs for the work had been hidden. And, true to the call, she responded, revealing plans once again, and speaking no words to explain, simply pointed them out and went on with the task. It was as if but the evening before we had parted, leaving yet to be done some detail of a task taken up with one common end; it was teacher and pupil, elder brother and younger, both bent on the one single end, but she with the power and knowledge that belong but to lions and sages.

Blavatsky often referred to the founding of the Theosophical Society as coming about as a result of occult direction from her teachers. Judge later wrote that the objects of the Society had been given to Olcott by the Masters before the meeting at which they were adopted. Thus, the founding of the Theosophy Society may be seen to have been inspired.

In 1881, looking back on the founding of the Society, Blavatsky wrote: &quot;Our society as a body might certainly be wrecked by mismanagement or the death of its founders, but the IDEA which it represents and which has gained so wide a currency, will run on like a crested wave of thought until it dashes upon the hard beach where materialism is picking and sorting its pebbles ...&quot; At this time, the affairs of the Society were largely in Olcott&#x27;s hands. Meetings were held irregularly, and many plans for occult experimentation were proposed. Neither Blavatsky nor Judge took any active part in the meetings after the first few sessions. He was busy with his law practice. She was beginning to write her first book, &quot;Isis Unveiled&quot;.

After Blavatsky died in 1891, Judge became involved in a dispute with Olcott and Annie Besant, whom he considered to have deviated from the original teaching of the Mahatmas. As a result, he ended his association with Olcott and Besant during 1895 and took most of the Society&#x27;s American Section with him. Despite being hounded by devotees to Besant, Judge managed his new organization for about a year until his death in New York City, whereupon Katherine Tingley became manager. The organization originating from the faction of Olcott and Besant is based nowadays in India and known as the Theosophical Society - Adyar, while the organization managed by Judge is known nowadays simply as the Theosophical Society, but often with the specification, &quot;international headquarters, Pasadena, California&quot;.

Judge died in 1896 in New York City.

In 1898, Ernest Temple Hargrove, who had initially supported Tingley, left with other members to form the Theosophical Society in America (Hargrove) Branch. Other new organizations split off from his, including the Temple of the People (whose library bears his name) during 1898 and the United Lodge of Theosophists or ULT during 1909.

<text>Total Request Live (known commonly as TRL) was an American television program that aired on MTV premiered on September 14, 1998. The early version of &quot;TRL&quot; featured popular music videos played during its countdown and was also used as a promotion tool by musicians, actors, and other celebrities to promote their newest works to target the show&#x27;s teen demographic.

During the original run of the program, &quot;TRL&quot; played the ten most requested music videos of the day, as voted on by viewers via phone or online. The show generally aired Monday through Thursday for one hour, though the scheduling and length of the show fluctuated over the years. Although &quot;TRL&quot; was billed as a live show, many episodes were prerecorded. Due to declining ratings, and the larger decline of music-based television in favor of online services, MTV announced the cancellation of &quot;TRL&quot; on September 15, 2008. The special three-hour finale episode, Total Finale Live, aired on November 16, 2008.

Less than a decade later, &quot;TRL&quot; was revived on October 2, 2017. In 2019, the show aired Saturday mornings at 10:00 am ET as TRL Top 10. The show was then rebranded to &quot;Fresh Out Live&quot;.

==History==
===Origin===
&quot;Total Request Live&quot; originated from several pre-existing programs on MTV. Various viewer request shows, such as &quot;Dial MTV&quot; and &quot;MTV&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, had aired on the network since 1986. In 1997 and 1998, MTV launched two new shows that became the predecessors of &quot;TRL&quot;: &quot;MTV Live&quot;, which was hosted by Toby Amies, Carson Daly, and Ananda Lewis and featured live performances and interviews from musical artists, and &quot;Total Request&quot;, a viewer request show hosted by Daly.
&quot;Total Request&quot; was more subdued than &quot;MTV Live&quot;, as Daly introduced music videos from an empty, dimly lit set. As the show progressed and gained more momentum, it was added to the daytime programming during MTV&#x27;s &quot;Summer Share&quot; in Seaside Heights, New Jersey. The show proved to be one of the most watched and most interactive in MTV history, demonstrating that it had potential to become an even larger success.

===Original run (1998–2008)===
==== Carson Daly era ====
In September 1998, MTV producers merged the real-time aspect of &quot;MTV Live&quot; with the fan-controlled countdown aspect of &quot;Total Request&quot; into &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. The program made its debut from MTV Studios on September 14. The show then grew to become MTV&#x27;s unofficial flagship program.

The original host of &quot;TRL&quot;, Carson Daly, brought popularity to the show. The abbreviation &quot;TRL&quot; was adopted as the official title of the show in February 1999, after Daly and Dave Holmes began using it on air regularly. In the years following, the program was rarely referred to by its original title. The show began successfully, receiving hundreds of votes for popular artists such as Hanson, Aaliyah, Blaque, TLC, Eminem, Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Korn, Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, Janet Jackson, *NSYNC, and Backstreet Boys.

&quot;TRL&quot; spent its first year developing a cult-type following. In late 1999, a live studio audience was added. By early 2000, the show reached its peak, becoming a very recognizable pop culture icon in its first two years of existence. A weekend edition of the show known as &quot;TRL Weekend&quot;, with a countdown of the week&#x27;s top 10 videos, aired for a short time in 2000.

In 2000, MTV gradually began introducing new VJs on &quot;TRL&quot;. After winning a viewer contest to interview celebrities at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Hilarie Burton was hired as a full-time VJ. Quddus Philippe began hosting duties in May 2001 as part of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Summer in the Keys&quot;. The following year, both Damien Fahey and La La Vasquez began hosting duties. These VJs often co-hosted with Daly or substituted in his absence.

In July 2001, MTV sponsored the Total Request Live Tour, which played over 30 dates in North America and featured acts like Destiny&#x27;s Child, 3LW, Jessica Simpson, Eve, and Nelly.

On October 23, 2002, &quot;TRL&quot; celebrated its 1,000th episode. The number-one video on that day was &quot;Dirrty&quot; by Christina Aguilera. Also throughout 2002, original host Daly was gradually seen less often, as he had begun his own late-night talk show &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot; on NBC. The show had near-daily segments from MTV News correspondents reporting on the latest in national or entertainment and music news from inside the studio.

====Post-Carson Daly era====
In 2003, the next generation of &quot;TRL&quot; was ushered in as Carson Daly officially stepped down as host to focus on his own talk show, which premiered a year earlier on NBC. Following Daly&#x27;s departure, Damien Fahey, Hilarie Burton, Quddus, and La La Vasquez rotated as hosts. Later additions to the hosting roster included Vanessa Minnillo in 2003, Susie Castillo in 2005, Stephen Colletti in 2006, and Lyndsey Rodrigues in 2007.

Some changes were made to &quot;TRL&quot; voting process in 2005. The show previously allowed anyone to vote online several times, but as part of these changes, only registered members of MTV.com could vote online. Additionally, a limit of one vote per day was added. Then, on July 10, 2006, MTV announced that votes would not be taken by phone, ending the use of the &quot;DIAL MTV&quot; phone number, which had been in use for voting on MTV since the premiere of the countdown show &quot;Dial MTV&quot; in the mid-1980s.

In September 2006, &quot;TRL&quot; reached its eighth anniversary and, at that point, the show was the longest-running live program that MTV had ever produced. Around this time, it began airing four days a week (Monday through Thursday), instead of all five weekdays. On November 2, 2006, the show introduced what was billed as the first-ever hip hop public service announcement on global warming. The three-minute piece, titled &quot;Trees&quot;, warned about deforestation and the dangers of global warming. The video corresponded with MTV&#x27;s social campaign, &quot;Break the Addiction&quot;, as part of &quot;think MTV&quot;.

On May 22, 2007, &quot;TRL&quot; celebrated its 2000th episode, showing highlights from the past 2000 episodes, and a special countdown of ten of the most successful videos to ever appear on the show. Justin Timberlake&#x27;s &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; topped the special countdown.

By 2008, the only remaining hosts of &quot;TRL&quot; were Fahey and Rodrigues. Burton left &quot;TRL&quot; in 2004 after joining the cast of The WB/CW&#x27;s &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;. Quddus departed in 2006 and became host of &quot;TV One Access&quot;. Minnillo left in 2007 and resumed an acting career.

====First cancellation====
In 2007, rumors began circulating that the ratings-challenged music video countdown show was to be cancelled. In early 2007, an average of 373,000 viewers regularly watched the program. &quot;New York Daily News&quot; were one of the first to publish this rumor. In February 2007, MTV said the rumor was unfounded and claimed &quot;TRL&quot; would continue to air for the foreseeable future. The producers of &quot;TRL&quot; experimented with web-based viewer interaction throughout the 2006–2007 season, showing viral videos and allowing viewers to send feedback on a video via internet forums and webcams, along with a heavy emphasis on MTV&#x27;s since discontinued Overdrive video portal. However, MTV still secretly planned to cancel the show and replace one with even more emphasis on viewer interaction, named &quot;YouRL&quot; (a homophone of URL.) Consequently, in July 2007, it was reported that &quot;YouRL&quot; was not received well by test audiences and the concept was abandoned. &quot;Total Request Live&quot; proceeded with a new season as usual on September 4, marking the tenth season of the show.

On September 15, 2008, it was announced that &quot;TRL&quot; would end. The final regular weekday episode aired on November 13, 2008, with guest Seth Green and The All-American Rejects. The Rejects spent the entire episode assisting in the tear down of the set which was a theme for the episode. At the end of the episode, Rodrigues and Fahey cooperatively added the last step in the demolition process by shutting down all the lights. Preceding this was a montage of cast and crew members saying their goodbyes by waving to the camera. &quot;Total Finale Live&quot;, a three-hour special marking the end of the show, aired on November 16, 2008. Several artists made appearances, including Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, Nelly, Beyoncé, 50 Cent, Fall Out Boy, Backstreet Boys, Justin Timberlake, Kid Rock, JC Chasez, Christina Aguilera, Travis Barker, Taylor Swift, Hilary Duff, Eminem, and Korn&#x27;s Jonathan Davis. Former host Carson Daly described the media atmosphere after his departure from &quot;TRL&quot; in an interview with &quot;TV Guide&quot;: &quot;MySpace was sold. Social networking took off. Technology went crazy. The whole tectonic shift of mass media. There were a lot of reasons why &quot;TRL&quot; became kind of a different show after I left. I don&#x27;t necessarily think it had anything to with me leaving as much as it had to do with the changing landscape.&quot; The last music video to be played on &quot;TRL&quot; (during the final episode) was &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; by Britney Spears, as the video that made number one on the countdown of the most iconic videos of all time.

====Final top 10====
&quot;TRL&quot; chose the top ten most iconic videos and aired them as their final countdown.
===Revivals (2014–2016)===
On June 25, 2014, MTV announced that they would bring back &quot;Total Request Live&quot; for a one-off special edition on July 2, presented by MTV personality Sway with recording artist Ariana Grande, who performed her single &quot;Problem&quot; and premiered her song &quot;Break Free&quot;, as well as having her hip hop knowledge tested in a &quot;Hip Hop Mix Up&quot; game. The special was titled &quot;Total Ariana Live&quot; and was broadcast from MTV&#x27;s Times Square studio in front of a live audience. Grande called it &quot;a huge honor&quot; to bring back &quot;TRL&quot;. The episode drew an average of 456,000 viewers.

On September 27, 2016, as part of MTV&#x27;s Elect This campaign, the network revived the program for a one-hour live special called &quot;Total Registration Live&quot;. It was simulcast on MTV&#x27;s website, app, Facebook and YouTube pages, and ElectThis.com. It was hosted by Nessa and featured performances by Ty Dolla Sign from his politically motivated mixtape &quot;Campaign&quot;. Kendall Jenner appeared in Times Square on behalf of Rock the Vote, and Ana Marie Cox and Jamil Smith from MTV News appeared on-air for segments. There were other appearances by Joss Whedon, Camila Cabello, Vic Mensa, Natalia Dyer, and Mack Wilds. Stories of millennials who have been activists were spotlighted.

====MTV Classic====
Following the launch of MTV Classic on August 1, 2016, music video blocks have consistently aired on the network under the name &quot;Total Request Playlist&quot;. However, this is merely an automated playlist of pop, rap/hip-hop, R&amp;B, and rock videos from the late 1990s to the 2000s.

===Return (2017–2019)===
On July 30, 2017, MTV announced that the network would revive &quot;TRL&quot;. In addition to the hosts, Liza Koshy, The Dolan Twins, Eva Gutowski, Gabbie Hanna and Gigi Gorgeous and Jaymes Skendarian were correspondents.

Since January 22, 2018, &quot;TRL&quot; has been shortened from a full hour to only a half-hour per day. The program was on hiatus until April 23, 2018. In February 2018, a half-hour late-night edition of TRL, &quot;Total Request LateNight&quot; was launched. The show aired Monday and Tuesday at 11 PM and was often an after-show for a preceding program. MTV announced plans to expand the show to three nights in the summer and four nights by the end of the year, but this never materialized. On April 23, 2018, MTV launched a pre-recorded, hour-long daily morning edition of &quot;TRL&quot; titled &quot;Total Request AM&quot;. The show aired at 8 AM and was hosted by Sway. Vinny from &quot;Jersey Shore&quot; was brought on as host for the first week and the first guests were boy band PrettyMuch. The program featured the return of a top ten countdown focusing on a specific playlist (Monday Motivation being the first countdown).

2019 saw another retooling and name change to &quot;TRL Top 10&quot;, which featured hosts Sway, Kevan Kenney and Jamila Mustafa. An offshoot of the program, &quot;Fresh Out Live&quot;, airs every Friday on MTV.

==Impact==
&quot;TRL&quot; became &quot;appointment after-school TV, its studio at 1515 Broadway a pop-culture fishbowl where rabid teens could catch a glimpse of their favorite stars.&quot; Debuting before social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, the show is considered one &quot;of the first truly interactive television shows, utilizing the synergy of the internet and television to countdown the top music videos of the day.&quot; Among the interactive features of &quot;TRL&quot; was the video shoutout, a 15-second video clip where fans could &quot;appear, screen-within-screen, during the airing of a music video&quot; screaming about their love for an artist or band. Because &quot;TRL&quot; was initially filmed in an age before social media, the show was seen as &quot;the last pure view of...big celebrities. You were getting unadulterated ego.&quot; The show had a number of notably unscripted moments happen in studio, such as band members streaking or celebrities showing up unannounced. Taylor Hanson of Hanson, a frequent guest on &quot;TRL&quot;, said &quot;Before you could see what an artist had for breakfast from Twitter, &quot;TRL&quot; was the place you were going to hear about it.&quot;

&quot;TRL&quot; not only became &quot;destination TV&quot; for young people to get news on their favorite stars and on pop culture, but also a place for viewers to stay updated with major world events as &quot;MTV News&quot; reporters would make regular appearances announcing news headlines. As &quot;MTV News&quot; correspondent SuChin Pak said, &quot;For young people, &quot;TRL&quot; was not only where you got to see your rock idols and pop stars, but where you connected with the major events happening around the world, outside the small town you were living in.&quot;

The show was likened to the millennial generation&#x27;s version of &quot;American Bandstand&quot; or &quot;Soul Train,&quot; averaging 853,000 viewers in 1999 according to Nielsen. &quot;TRL&quot; is widely viewed as the show that launched the careers of many artists from the late 1990s and early 2000s. &quot;MTV News&quot; correspondent John Norris said, &quot;It&#x27;s an interesting debate whether NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, Britney [Spears], Christina [Aguilera], Jessica [Simpson] and Good Charlotte would have had the careers they had without &quot;TRL&quot;.&quot; Writing for &quot;Spin&quot;, Peter Gaston opined that &quot;TRL&quot; &quot;helped keep the major labels afloat by boosting pop artists sales numbers on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.&quot; &quot;TRL&quot; became a &quot;must-stop on every celebrity&#x27;s promotional itinerary.&quot; Musicians themselves including Eminem and Britney Spears would sometimes fill in for the hosts. The show was also the site of in-studio performances by big artists promoting album releases.

===Boy bands===
Even though late 1990s boy bands like Backstreet Boys and NSYNC released albums before &quot;TRL&quot; began in the fall of 1998, both groups only reached their commercial peaks after their videos were seen on &quot;TRL&quot;. In 1999, the Backstreet Boys&#x27; second LP, &quot;Millennium&quot;, achieved the highest first week sales ever from an LP at the time.

In 2000, when NSYNC released their second LP &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;, they topped the Backstreet Boys&#x27; first week sales and set a record for first-week album sales that would last for 15 years until Adele&#x27;s &quot;25&quot; surpassed the record in 2015. Fans numbering in the thousands stood outside &quot;TRL&quot; studio to see NSYNC or Backstreet Boys appear as guests, resulting in the closure of Times Square. Throughout most of 1998, 1999, and 2000, videos by the Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC would claim the top position on the countdown. Other boy bands of the era who achieved number one videos or received heavy rotation on the show included 98 Degrees, O-Town, B2K, soulDecision, and LFO.

===Pop princesses===
Pop singers like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Mandy Moore and Jessica Simpson all made their music debuts on &quot;TRL&quot; as well. Spears, Aguilera, and Simpson would often appear as guests and their music videos would receive regular airplay. Simpson&#x27;s video &quot;Irresistible&quot; reached number two on the countdown in 2001. Shakira made her English-language pop debut with &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;, and saw regular number one spot status with the songs &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot;, &quot;La Tortura&quot; (the first only Spanish-speaking song to reach number one on the countdown), and &quot;Hips Don&#x27;t Lie&quot;. Mandy Moore saw success on the show with her debut single&#x27;s &quot;Candy&quot; in 1999 and &quot;I Wanna Be with You&quot;, but did not score her first number-one video until her 2002 single &quot;Crush&quot;.

Ashlee Simpson is another pop singer that has had success on &quot;TRL.&quot; Ashlee would go on to score two videos in the number one spot with &quot;Boyfriend&quot; and &quot;Invisible.&quot; The artist with the most retired videos is Britney Spears with 13 videos retired, an honorary retired video (&quot;I&#x27;m a Slave 4 U&quot;), and three videos retired number one. A &quot;pop princess&quot; streak occurred in March 2007, where the number one and number two spots were women for every show. There was no other month in the history of &quot;TRL&quot; where every show had a woman at the top spot.

===Rock bands===
Although best known for featuring pop acts, &quot;TRL&quot; regularly featured videos and performances from rock bands in genres such as nu metal, pop punk and emo pop. The nu metal/rap metal bands Korn and Limp Bizkit were particularly popular on the program in the late 1990s, and often shared airtime with Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys. In later years, Green Day, Blink-182, My Chemical Romance, Linkin Park, Fall Out Boy and Sum 41 also were successful on the TRL chart.

===Disney stars===
Hilary Duff was the first Disney Star in heavy rotation on MTV, She premiered &quot;So Yesterday&quot;, which peaked at number one days later, and continue to top the countdown with the videos for &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot;, &quot;Fly&quot;, &quot;Wake Up&quot;, &quot;Beat of My Heart&quot; and&quot;With Love&quot; and her popularity was a determining factor for another Disney stars on TRL. Vanessa Hudgens premiered &quot;Come Back to Me&quot;, which peaked at number three, and &quot;Say OK&quot;, which only went to number ten. The Jonas Brothers premiered their songs &quot;Hold On&quot; and &quot;SOS&quot; on the show; &quot;SOS&quot; made it on the countdown peaking at number six. &quot;When You Look Me in the Eyes&quot; was on the charts for several weeks before peaking at number one, after fans crushed and flooded the &quot;TRL&quot; site by requesting the video hundreds of times on March 19, 2008. &quot;Burnin&#x27; Up&quot; has also made it to the number-one spot on &quot;TRL&quot;. Ashley Tisdale premiered &quot;He Said She Said&quot; on &quot;TRL&quot; and it reached the number-one spot for 16 days and was retired at 40 days in the countdown, becoming the most successful song for a Disney recording artist in the show. Aly &amp; AJ&#x27;s videos for &quot;Rush&quot;, &quot;Chemicals React&quot; and &quot;Potential Breakup Song&quot; have all been on the countdown with &quot;Rush&quot; peaking at number two and &quot;Chemicals React&quot; peaking at number four, and &quot;Potential Breakup Song&quot; peaking at number five. Miley Cyrus&#x27;s &quot;7 Things&quot; premiered on &quot;TRL&quot; and reached number four on the show.

==Video game==
A PC video game called MTV Total Request Live Trivia was developed by Hypnotix and published by Take-Two Interactive, with a release on August 14, 2001. GameRankings rated it at 53.89% acclaim, with a 48/100 grade from Metacritic.

==International versions==
===Past programs===
* The first version of &quot;TRL&quot; outside the US was in Italy. Started on MTV Italy on 2 November 1999, it was hosted by Marco Maccarini and Giorgia Surina, followed by Federico Russo and Carolina Di Domenico. Since the 2005–06 season, Surina returned to &quot;TRL&quot; with a new co-host, Alessandro Cattelan. After the 2005–06 season, the show was hosted only by Cattelan. For the 2007–08 season, the show was hosted for the first moment by Cattelan and Elena Santarelli, and for the summer, the male host was replaced by Carlo Pastore. Later Pastore was still the main host, but the female host changed to Elisabetta Canalis. Throughout its eight seasons, &quot;TRL&quot; was broadcast from Milan, Rome, Venice, Naples, Genoa and Turin. &quot;TRL Italy&quot; is the longest-running show on MTV Italy: on 23 December 2004, a special two-hour event, &quot;TRL #1000&quot;, was aired to celebrate the programme&#x27;s 1000th episode. From 2006 to 2012, there was also an award programme called &quot;TRL Awards&quot; where viewers chose the artist of the year via web or mobile. In the summer of 2007, a special weekly show called &quot;TRL Extra Live&quot; aired, featuring Italian singers performing a mini-concert. The final version of the programme was hosted by Brenda Lodigiani, Alessandro Arcodia, Wintana Rezene and Andrea Cadioli under the name &quot;TRL on the Road&quot; and ended on 24 September 2010.

* MTV România launched the Romanian version of &quot;TRL&quot; from an Orange concept store on Calea Victoriei (a major commercial avenue in the centre of Bucharest) on 23 January 2006. The show aired two times a week on Tuesday and Wednesday. The graphics were similar to that of the Italian version. The show was cancelled in 2009.
* The British version, known as &quot;TRL UK&quot;, was hosted by Dave Berry, Alex Zane, Jo Good, and Maxine Akhtar. It was broadcast live from MTV Networks Europe Studios in Camden, London before moving to Leicester Square in London from second series. Following the second series&#x27; broadcast from Leicester Square, the top ten countdown was removed from the show. The second series finished at the end of 2005 and the show never returned to air.
* The Australian version of &quot;TRL&quot; began as a weekend show, but then began airing live Monday through Friday. It was hosted by Maz Compton, Lyndsey Rodrigues, Nathan Sapsford, and Jason Robert Dundas. In early 2006, it returned to airing only on Friday evenings. The show was cancelled at the end of 2006 and was replaced by &quot;The Lair&quot;. A revival of &quot;TRL&quot; returned in 2019. It is hosted by Ash London, Angus O&#x27;Loughlin, Flex Mami, and Lisa Hamilton.
* After a Polish version of &quot;TRL&quot; was unsuccessful, MTV Poland decided to launch a new chart show based on &quot;TRL&quot;″s structure titled &quot;RMF MAXXX Hits&quot;, which aired from Monday to Saturday at 2 pm.
* MTV France launched the French version () of the US show on 24 January 2007. The format was different from the original concept: there was no video countdown and each episode included a film&#x27;s mini-documentaries entitled &quot;&quot;. The show closed after only a single episode on 25 January 2007.
* The German version of &quot;TRL&quot; was very successful throughout Europe (after Italy), and it was known as &quot;Total Request Live Germany&quot;. &quot;TRL Germany&quot; had the highest television ratings of all the &quot;TRL&quot; versions in Europe. The show was hosted by Joko Winterscheidt and Mirjam Weichselbraun or Patrice Bouédibéla from Tuesday to Friday from 4:30 to 5:30 pm, and it was divided in four versions: &quot;Urban TRL&quot; (hip-hop music), &quot;Rock TRL&quot; (rock music), regular &quot;TRL&quot; (various genres), and &quot;TRL XXL&quot; (special live guest). It was replaced with &quot;MTV Home&quot; in Summer 2009.

* MTV Tr3s, a US channel targeted to bilingual Latino people, premiered &quot;Mi TRL&quot; in September 2006. The show carried the same format and graphics as the English-language version of &quot;TRL&quot;. &quot;Mi TRL&quot; was initially anchored by Carlos Santos and Susie Castillo, with Santos later being replaced by Denise Ramerez. MTV News segments on the show are delivered from Los Angeles by correspondent Liz Hernandez. The show was cancelled along with &quot;TRL&quot; in November 2008.
* Viacom&#x27;s sister channel BET featured its own urban-oriented countdown, &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot;, and the two shows frequently competed with one another for guests, though by the end of the run of &quot;TRL&quot;, both shows aired with some space between them, allowing guests to appear on both shows on the same day.
* TeenNick featured a kid-friendly rendition of &quot;TRL&quot; called &quot;TeenNick Top 10&quot;.

<doc id="200261" wikidata="Q230697" url="?curid=200261" title="Empress Nagako">
<text>Nagako (6 March 190316 June 2000), posthumously honoured as Empress Kōjun, was a member of the Imperial House of Japan, the wife of Emperor Shōwa (Hirohito) and the mother of Emperor Emeritus Akihito. She was Empress of Japan from 1926 until her husband&#x27;s death in 1989, making her the longest-serving empress consort in Japanese history.

==Early life==

Princess Nagako was born in Kuni-no-miya&#x27;s family home in Tokyo, Japan on 6 March 1903, into one of the &quot;Ōke&quot; branches of the Imperial House of Japan, which were eligible to provide an heir to the throne of Japan (by adoption). She was therefore a princess by birth, as the daughter of Kuniyoshi, Prince Kuni (1873–1929) by his consort, Chikako (1879–1956). While her father was a scion of the imperial family itself, her mother descended from &quot;daimyōs&quot;, the feudal or military aristocracy. Nagako would become one of the last Japanese who could remember what life was like inside the Japanese aristocracy in the years before the Second World War.

As a young girl, Nagako attended the Girls&#x27; Department of Peers&#x27; School in Tokyo (now Gakushūin), which was a school set up especially for the daughters of the aristocracy and imperial family. Among her cohort was Crown Princess Bangja of Korea (then known as Princess Masako Nashimoto). Following her betrothal at age fourteen, Nagako was withdrawn from this school and began a six-year training program aimed at developing the accomplishments deemed necessary for an empress.

==Marriage and children==

Nagako was betrothed to her distant cousin the Crown Prince Hirohito, later the Emperor Shōwa (1901–1989) at a very young age, in a match arranged by their parents, which was usual in Japanese society at that time. Her lineage and her father&#x27;s unblemished military career were the major considerations. In a step away from tradition, Hirohito was allowed to choose his own bride. Nagako herself had no choice in the matter. In 1917, at the age of 14, she and other eligible candidates for betrothal participated in a tea ceremony at the Imperial Palace while the Crown Prince watched unseen from behind a screen. He eventually selected Nagako. Prime Minister Yamagata Aritomo, a prince from a rival clan, was said to be opposed to Hirohito&#x27;s choice. He and other royal clans tried to dissuade him from marrying her, arguing that she had colour-blind relatives on her mother&#x27;s side of the family. In January 1919, the engagement of Princess Nagako to the then-Crown Prince Hirohito was announced. During their six-year courtship, they met only nine times and were always accompanied by a chaperone.

Princess Nagako married Crown Prince Hirohito on 26 January 1924 and became the Crown Princess of Japan. The wedding had been delayed in the aftermath of the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and following an assassination attempt on Hirohito&#x27;s life. Their marriage marked the last time a future empress was chosen from minor princely families that usually provided brides for the main line. She became the empress of Japan upon Hirohito&#x27;s accession to the throne on 25 December 1926. Unlike his royal predecessors, Emperor Hirohito decided to abandon his 39 court concubines. Over the first decade of their marriage, Empress Nagako gave birth to four daughters (see Issue). As she had failed to produce a son, courtiers attempted to persuade the Emperor to take concubines, but he remained monogamous. They also gave her the nickname &quot;onna bara&quot;, &quot;girl womb&quot; or &quot;girl tummy&quot;. It was only on 23 December 1933, almost ten years after their wedding, that the young couple had a son, and gave Japan an heir, in the birth of . There were nationwide celebrations across Japan following his birth, which was described by Nagako as &quot;the happiest moment in my life&quot;. In all, Hirohito and Nagako had seven children, five daughters and two sons, three of whom predeceased Nagako. (see Issue)

==Empress consort==

Empress Nagako performed her ceremonial duties in a traditional manner. She initially came to live in the palace during the time when people there spoke an archaic imperial form of Japanese that has largely disappeared. Her role required her to attend special ceremonies such as those for the 2600th anniversary of the legendary foundation of the Empire of Japan in 1940 or the conquest of Singapore in 1942.
During the Second World War, Nagako was largely confined to palace grounds and her duties involved tending to wounded generals and writing to families who had lost loved ones during the war. Their children were sent to the countryside, while she and Hirohito resided at the Obunko imperial air-raid shelter, which was built in the Fukiage Gardens on palace grounds. Nagako also assisted with growing vegetables and raising poultry. Her personal views on the war are not well known, though she is reported to have described the war years as &quot;the hardest time of my life&quot;. NHK reported that &quot;her heart was in pain when she saw the emperor deeply agitated every day during and immediately after World War II.&quot; After the occupation of Japan, the court became more accepting of Western and foreign traditions and Nagako took English lessons from two American tutors. She also toured different parts of Japan to meet orphans and families who had suffered loss.

It is not clear whether Nagako openly disapproved of her son Akihito&#x27;s choice of a wife when he decided to marry commoner Michiko Shōda, but it was widely reported in the press that she and her daughter-in-law had a strained relationship. Nagako, who was tradition-conscious, sided with those who criticized Michiko for breastfeeding her children, carrying them in public, and raising them herself. A senior chamberlain claimed in his memoir that Michiko once directly asked her mother-in-law why she disliked her. Michiko also held suspicions about her chief lady-in-waiting, whom she believed to be spying on her on the orders of Nagako. Her and Akihito&#x27;s attempts at dismissing the servant were unsuccessful. The rift between the two women caused Michiko to suffer a nervous breakdown in 1963.
Nagako was the first Japanese empress consort to travel overseas. She accompanied Hirohito on his European tour in 1971 and later on his state visit to the United States in 1975. She also took care of him in later years and chose his attire for him. Hirohito was said to have described their union as a source of solace and contentment and Nagako reportedly &quot;showed a subject&#x27;s deference&quot; to him. Their marriage lasted nearly 65 years, the longest of any Japanese imperial couple. A talented artist, two collections of Nagako&#x27;s paintings, which she signed as &quot;Toen&quot; or Peach Garden, were published and she gifted the UK&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth II with one of her pieces in 1971. She also wrote &quot;waka&quot;, a collection of which was published in 1974. She was reported to have enjoyed singing, and played the piano, violin and Japanese harp. Nagako suffered a fall in July 1977, injuring her spine, and following another serious fall was confined to a wheelchair from 1980 for the remainder of her life. The last public ceremony she took part in was her husband&#x27;s 86th birthday celebrations in April 1987.

==Empress dowager==
After the Emperor&#x27;s death on 7 January 1989, she became empress dowager. At that time, she was in failing health herself and could not attend her husband&#x27;s funeral. She was confined to a wheelchair and remained in seclusion for the rest of her life. A video of her sitting in a wheelchair beside a window was published in 1993. There were also persistent rumours that she was suffering from dementia or Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In 1995, she became the longest-living empress dowager of Japan, breaking the record of Empress Kanshi, who had died 868 years earlier.
At the time of her death at the age of 97 in 2000, Nagako had been an empress for 74 years. In her final days, the Imperial Household Agency (IHA) announced that she was suffering from breathing problems but that the illness was not serious and she was on a respirator. On 15 June, the IHA director-general told certain segments of the press that her condition had taken a turn and it was reported that she had slipped into a coma on the next day after her blood pressure dropped. Nagako died at 4:46 pm on 16 June 2000, with her family at her side. Her son Akihito, who had been carrying out public engagements earlier in the day, immediately went to Fukiage Palace and reportedly held his mother&#x27;s hand as she died. At his request, no injections or intravenous fluids were administered to prevent any suffering. The IHA announced her death at 6:30 pm and gave &quot;old age&quot; as the cause of death. Following the announcement, neon signs in Ginza and the lights in Tokyo Tower were turned off. The flags flew at half-mast on government buildings, and music and dance were excluded from public events for a day. People also gathered outside palace gates to pay their respects.

A mourning period of 150 days was declared by the imperial court. A team was set up by the IHA to organize her funeral, which largely followed the customs implemented at her mother-in-law Empress Teimei&#x27;s funeral in 1951. Her funeral was held at the Toshimagaoka Imperial Cemetery on 25 July 2000 and was attended by one thousand mourners, including members of the imperial family, government leaders and foreign diplomats. Her son Akihito was the chief mourner during the service, which featured elements of the Shinto religion. Hundreds of mourners also gathered outside cemetery gates.

Emperor Akihito granted his mother the posthumous title of &quot;Empress Kōjun&quot; (which means &quot;fragrant purity&quot;), drawing inspiration from the &quot;Kaifūsō&quot;. Her final resting place is in a mausoleum named &quot;Musashino no Higashi no Misasagi&quot;, near that of her husband within the Musashi Imperial Graveyard.

<doc id="200262" wikidata="Q442617" url="?curid=200262" title="Henry Steel Olcott">
<text>Colonel Henry Steel Olcott (2 August 1832 – 17 February 1907) was an American military officer, journalist, lawyer, Freemason (member of Huguenot Lodge #448, now #46) and the co-founder and first president of the Theosophical Society.

Olcott was the first well-known American of European ancestry to make a formal conversion to Buddhism. His subsequent actions as president of the Theosophical Society helped create a renaissance in the study of Buddhism. Olcott is considered a Buddhist modernist for his efforts in interpreting Buddhism through a Europeanized lens.

Olcott was a major revivalist of Buddhism in Sri Lanka and he is still honored in Sri Lanka for these efforts. Vice President of the Ananda College Old Boys Association Samitha Seneviratne has said that &quot;Col. Olcott&#x27;s contribution towards the betterment of our country, nation, religion, justice and good conduct has been so great that he remains in our hearts forever&quot;.

==Biography==
Olcott was born on 2 August 1832 in Orange, New Jersey, the oldest of six children, to Presbyterian businessman Henry Wyckoff Olcott and Emily Steele Olcott. As a child, Olcott lived on his father&#x27;s New Jersey farm.

During his teens he attended first the College of the City of New York and later Columbia University, where he joined the St. Anthony Hall fraternity, a milieu of well-known people. In 1851 his father&#x27;s business failed and he had to leave the university.

While living in Amherst, Ohio, Olcott was introduced to spiritualism by relatives who had formed a spiritualist circle after seeing the Fox sisters on tour in Cleveland. During this period, Olcott became interested in studies of &quot;psychology, hypnotism, psychometry, and mesmerism&quot; In 1853, after returning to New York, Olcott became a founding member of the New York Conference of Spiritualists. He also published letters and articles on spiritualist topics in the &quot;Spiritual Telegraph&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Amherst&quot;.

From 1858 to 1860 Olcott was the agricultural correspondent for the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Mark Lane Express&quot;, but occasionally submitted articles on other subjects. He was present for John Brown&#x27;s execution.

He also published a genealogy of his family extending back to Thomas Olcott, one of the founders of Hartford, Connecticut, in 1636.

In 1860 Olcott married Mary Epplee Morgan, daughter of the rector of Trinity parish, New Rochelle, New York. They had four children, two of whom died in infancy.

He served in the US Army during the American Civil War and afterward was admitted as the Special Commissioner of the War Department in New York. He was later promoted to the rank of colonel and transferred to the Department of the Navy in Washington, DC. He was well respected, and in 1865, following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, assisted in the investigation of the assassination.

In 1868 he became a lawyer specializing in insurance, revenue, and fraud.
In 1874 he became aware of the séances of the Eddy Brothers of Chittenden, Vermont. His interest aroused, Olcott wrote an article for the &quot;New York Sun&quot;, in which he investigated Eddy Farms. His article was popular enough that other papers, such as the &quot;New York Daily Graphic&quot;, republished it. His 1874 publication &quot;People from the Other World&quot; began with his early articles concerning the Spiritualist movement.

Also in 1874, Olcott met Helena Blavatsky while both were visiting the Eddy farm. His foundational interest in the Spiritualist movement and his budding relationship with Blavatsky helped foster his development of spiritual philosophy.

Olcott continued to act as a lawyer during the first few years of the establishment of the Theosophical Society, in addition to being a financial supporter of the new religious movement. In early 1875 Olcott was asked by prominent Spiritualists to investigate an accusation of fraud against the mediums Jenny and Nelson Holmes, who had claimed to materialize the famous &quot;spirit control&quot; Katie King (Doyle 1926: volume 1, 269–277).

In 1880 Helena Blavatsky and Olcott became the first Westerners to receive the Three Refuges and Five Precepts, the ceremony by which one traditionally becomes a Buddhist; thus Blavatsky was the first Western woman to do so. Olcott once described his adult faith as &quot;pure, primitive Buddhism&quot;, but his was a unique sort of Buddhism.

==Theosophical society==
From 1874 on, Olcott&#x27;s spiritual growth and development with Blavatsky and other spiritual leaders would lead to the founding of the Theosophical Society.
In 1875, Olcott, Blavatsky, and others, notably William Quan Judge, formed the Theosophical Society in New York City, USA. Olcott financially supported the earliest years of the Theosophical Society and was acting president while Blavatsky served as the Society&#x27;s Secretary.

In December 1878, they left New York in order to move the headquarters of the Society to India.
They arrived at Bombay on February 16, 1879. Olcott set out to experience the native country of his spiritual leader, the Buddha. The headquarters of the Society were established at Adyar, Chennai as the Theosophical Society Adyar, starting also the Adyar Library and Research Centre within the headquarters.

While in India, Olcott strove to receive the translations of sacred oriental texts which were becoming available as a result of western researches. His intent was to avoid the Westernized interpretations often encountered in America, and to discover the pure message of texts from the Buddhist, Hindu, and Zoroastrian religions, in order to properly educate Westerners.

Olcott&#x27;s research and translation efforts put him in dialogue with early, ostensibly secular anthropologists and scholars of religion. He corresponded extensively with Max Müller, asking questions related to his interest in Hinduism and Buddhism and sharing discoveries from his travels in South Asia. He also personally met both Müller and Edward Burnett Tylor at least once at the University of Oxford.

Olcott&#x27;s main religious interest was Buddhism, and he is commonly known for his work in Sri Lanka. After a two-year correspondence with Sri Piyaratana Tissa Mahanayake Thero, he and Blavatsky arrived in the then capital Colombo on May 16, 1880. Helena Blavatsky and Henry Steele Olcott took Five Precepts at the Wijayananda Viharaya located at Weliwatta in Galle on May 19, 1880.
On that day Olcott and Blavatsky were formally acknowledged as Buddhists, although Olcott noted that they had previously declared themselves Buddhists, while still living in America.

During his time in Sri Lanka Olcott strove to revive Buddhism within the region, while compiling the tenets of Buddhism for the education of Westerners. It was during this period that he wrote the &quot;Buddhist Catechism&quot; (1881), which is still used today.
The Theosophical Society built several Buddhist schools in Ceylon, most notably Ananda College in 1886, Dharmaraja College Kandy in 1887, Maliyadeva College Kurunegala in 1888, Siddhartha Kumara Maha Vidyalaya (First named as &quot;Buddhist boys&#x27; School&quot;) Gampaha in 1891, Dharmadutha College, Badulla in 1891, Mahinda College Galle in 1892, Nalanda College, Colombo in 1925, Musaeus College (Girls School) in Colombo and Dharmasoka College in Ambalangoda.
Olcott also acted as an adviser to the committee appointed to design a Buddhist flag in 1885. The Buddhist flag designed with the assistance of Olcott was later adopted as a symbol by the World Fellowship of Buddhists and as the universal flag of all Buddhist traditions.
Helena Blavatsky eventually went to live in London, where she died in 1891, but Olcott stayed in India and pursued the work of the Theosophical Society there. Olcott&#x27;s role in the Theosophical Society would still be as president, but the induction of Annie Besant sparked a new era of the movement. Upon his death, the Theosophical Society elected her to take over as president and leader of the movement.

==Buddhist catechism==

===Text of &quot;Buddhist Catechism&quot;===

Olcott&#x27;s &quot;Buddhist Catechism&quot;, composed in 1881, is one of his most enduring contributions to the revival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, and remains in use there today. The text outlines what Olcott saw to be the basic doctrines of Buddhism, including the life of the Buddha, the message of the Dharma, the role of the Sangha. The text also treats how the Buddha&#x27;s message correlates with contemporary society. Olcott was considered by South Asians and others as a Buddhist revivalist.

It is presented in the same format of question and answer used in some Christian catechisms. Here are a few examples from that text:

Olcott&#x27;s catechism reflects a new, post-Enlightenment interpretation of traditional Buddhist tenets. As David McMahan stated, &quot;[Olcott] allied Buddhism with scientific rationalism in implicit criticism of orthodox Christianity, but went well beyond the tenets of conventional science in extrapolating from the Romantic- and Transcendentalist-influenced &#x27;occult sciences&#x27; of the nineteenth century.&quot;

===Olcott&#x27;s science and theosophy===

The Theosophists combination of spiritualism and science to investigate the supernatural reflected the society&#x27;s desire to combine religion and reason and to produce a rationally spiritual movement. This &quot;occult science&quot; within the Theosophical Society was used to find the &quot;truth&quot; behind all of the world&#x27;s major religions. Through their research, Olcott and Blavatsky concluded that Buddhism best embodied elements of what they found significant in all religions.

Olcott utilized scientific reasoning in his synthesis and presentation of Buddhism. This is clearly seen in a chapter of his &quot;Buddhist Catechism&quot;, entitled &quot;Buddhism and Science&quot;. Notably, his efforts represent one of the earliest attempts to combine scientific understanding and reasoning with Buddhist religion. The interrelationship he saw between Buddhism and Science paralleled his Theosophical approach to show the scientific bases for supernatural phenomena such as auras, hypnosis, and Buddhist &quot;miracles&quot;.

==Death and legacy==

Olcott was President of the Theosophical Society until his death on February 17, 1907.

Two major streets in Colombo and Galle have been named Olcott Mawatha, to commemorate him. Statues of him has been erected in Galle and Colombo. Many other Buddhist schools that he helped found or have been founded in his memory possess commemorative statues in honour of his contribution to Buddhist education. On September 10, 2011, a statue of Colonel Olcott was unveiled at a Buddhist temple near Princeton, New Jersey. He is still remembered fondly by many Sri Lankans today. 

The date of his death is often remembered by Buddhist centers and Sunday schools in present-day Sri Lanka, as well as in Theosophical communities around the globe. Olcott believed himself to be Asia&#x27;s savior, the outsider hero who would sweep in at the end of the drama to save a disenchanted subcontinent from spiritual death.

The effort to revitalize Buddhism within Sri Lanka was successful and influenced many native Buddhist intellectuals. Sri Lanka was dominated by British colonial power and influence at the time, and many Buddhists heard Olcott&#x27;s interpretation of the Buddha&#x27;s message as socially motivating and supportive of efforts to overturn colonialist efforts to ignore Buddhism and Buddhist tradition. This was despite the fact that his re-interpretation of the Buddha was along modern liberal ideas promoted by the British in Sri Lanka. As David McMahan wrote, &quot;Henry Steel Olcott saw the Buddha as a figure much like the ideal liberal freethinker – someone full of &#x27;benevolence,&#x27; &#x27;gratitude,&#x27; and &#x27;tolerance,&#x27; who promoted &#x27;brotherhood among all men&#x27; as well as &#x27;lessons in manly self-reliance&quot;. His Europeanized view of Buddha influenced Sri Lankan leaders, such as Anagarika Dharmapala.

Olcott and Anagarika Dharmapala were associates, which reflects both men&#x27;s awareness of the divide between East and West—as seen in their presentation of Buddhism to Europe. Olcott helped financially support the Buddhist presence at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago, 1893. The inclusion of Buddhists in the Parliament allowed for the expansion of Buddhism within Europe in general and in America specifically, leading to other Buddhist Modernist movements.

As Stephen Prothero wrote,

It was Olcott who most eloquently articulated and most obviously embodied the diverse religious and cultural traditions that shaped Protestant Buddhism, who gave the revival movement both its organizational shape and its emphasis on education-as-character-building. The most Protestant of all early Protestant Buddhists, Olcott was the liminoid figure, the griot who because of his awkward standing betwixt and between the American Protestant grammars of his youth and the Asian Buddhist lexicon of his adulthood was able to conjure traditional Sinhalese Buddhism, Protestant modernism, metropolitan gentility, and academic Orientalism into a decidedly new creole tradition. This creole tradition Olcott then passed on to a whole generation of Sinhalese students educated in his schools.
Olcott is probably the only major contributor to the nineteenth-century Sinhalese Buddhist revival who was actually born and raised in the Protestant Christian tradition, though he had already left Protestantism for Spiritualism long before he became a Buddhist. His childhood Protestantism is a reason that many scholars have referred to the Buddhist modernism he influenced as &quot;Protestant Buddhism&quot;.

<text>The Theosophical Society is the organizational body of Theosophy, an esoteric new religious movement. It was founded in New York City, U.S. in 1875. Among its founders were Helena Blavatsky, a Russian mystic and the principal thinker of the Theosophy movement, and Henry Steel Olcott, the society&#x27;s first president. It draws upon a wide array of influences among them older European philosophies and movements such as Neoplatonism and occultism, as well as parts of Asian religious traditions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam.

==Locations==
The original organization, after splits and realignments, has several successors. Following the death of Helena Blavatsky, competition emerged between factions within the Society, particularly among founding members. The organization split into the Theosophical Society Adyar (Olcott-Besant) and the Theosophical Society Pasadena (Judge).

The former group, headquartered in India, is the most widespread international group holding the name &quot;Theosophical Society&quot; today.

&quot;Theosophical Society-Adyar&quot; is located at Adyar situated in the Indian city of Chennai.

==History==
===Formation and objectives===

The Theosophical Society was officially formed in New York City, United States, on November 17, 1875, by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, Colonel Henry Steel Olcott, William Quan Judge, and 16 others. It was self-described as &quot;an unsectarian body of seekers after Truth, who endeavor to promote Brotherhood and strive to serve humanity.&quot; Olcott was its first president, and remained president until his death in 1907. In the early months of 1875, Olcott and Judge had come to believe that, if Blavatsky was a spiritualist, she was no ordinary one. The society&#x27;s initial objective was the &quot;study and elucidation of Occultism, the Cabala etc.&quot; After a few years Olcott and Blavatsky moved to India and established the International Headquarters at Adyar, in Madras (now Chennai). They were also interested in studying Eastern religions, and these were included in the Society&#x27;s agenda.

After several iterations the Society&#x27;s objectives were incorporated at Chennai (Madras) on April 3, 1905. The Three Objects of the Theosophical Society are as follows :

Sympathy with the above objects was the sole condition of admission to the society. The Society was organized as a non-sectarian entity. The following was stated in the &quot;Constitution and Rules of the Theosophical Society&quot;

The Society reformulated this view in a resolution passed by the &quot;General Council of the Theosophical Society&quot; on December 23, 1924.
Three years before, in 1921, it was signed the institutive charter of the Spanish &quot;Sociedad Teosófica&quot;, which had local branches in Madrid, Tarrasa, Barcelona, Seville, Valencia, Alicante, Zanoni, Cadiz and Dharma.

=== Hidden Masters===
One of the central philosophical tenets promoted by the Society was the complex doctrine of &quot;The Intelligent Evolution of All Existence&quot;, occurring on a cosmic scale, incorporating both the physical and non-physical aspects of the known and unknown Universe, and affecting all of its constituent parts regardless of apparent size or importance. The theory was originally promulgated in the &quot;Secret Doctrine&quot;, the 1888 &quot;magnum opus&quot; of Helena Blavatsky. According to this view, humanity&#x27;s evolution on earth (and beyond) is part of the overall cosmic evolution. It is overseen by a hidden spiritual hierarchy, the so-called &quot;Masters of the Ancient Wisdom&quot;, whose upper echelons consist of advanced spiritual beings.

Blavatsky portrayed the Theosophical Society as being part of one of many attempts throughout the millennia by this hidden Hierarchy to guide humanity – in concert with the overall intelligent cosmic evolutionary scheme – towards its ultimate, immutable evolutionary objective: the attainment of perfection and the conscious, willing participation in the evolutionary process. These attempts require an earthly infrastructure (such as the Theosophical Society) which she held was ultimately under the inspiration of a number of Mahatmas, members of the Hierarchy.

===Schisms===
After Helena Blavatsky&#x27;s death in 1891, the society&#x27;s leaders seemed at first to work together peacefully. This did not last long. Judge was accused by Olcott and then prominent Theosophist Annie Besant of forging letters from the Mahatmas; he ended his association with Olcott and Besant in 1895 and took most of the Society&#x27;s American Section with him. The original organization led by Olcott and Besant is based in India and is known as the Theosophical Society – Adyar. The group led by Judge further splintered, after his 1896 death, into a faction led by Katherine Tingley, and another associated with Judge&#x27;s secretary Ernest Temple Hargrove which split off in 1898. While Hargrove&#x27;s faction no longer survives, the faction led by Tingley is known as the Theosophical Society with the clarifying statement, &quot;International Headquarters, Pasadena, California&quot;. A third organization, the United Lodge of Theosophists or ULT, in 1909 split off from the latter organization.

In 1902, Rudolf Steiner became general secretary of the German-Austrian division of the Theosophical Society. He maintained a Western-oriented course, relatively independent from the Adyar headquarters. After serious philosophical conflicts with Annie Besant and other members of the international leadership on the spiritual significance of Christ and on the status of the young boy Jiddu Krishnamurti (see section below), most of the German and Austrian members split off in 1913 and under Steiner&#x27;s leadership formed the Anthroposophical Society, which then expanded to many other countries.

The English headquarters of the Theosophical Society are at 50 Gloucester Place, London. Which is now no longer active. The Theosophical Society in Ireland , based in Pembroke Road, Dublin, is a wholly independent organisation which claims to have received its charter directly from Helena Blavatsky. The original group contained (among others) George William Russell (A. E.) poet and mystic, and the leadership role later fell to Russell&#x27;s friend P. G. Bowen, (author and teacher of practical occultism) and later still to Bowen&#x27;s long time student Dorothy Emerson. The leadership of this group were students of Emerson. The independent Dublin organisation should not be confused with a similarly named group affiliated to Adyar which is based in Belfast but claims an all-Ireland jurisdiction.

==&quot;World Teacher&quot;==
In addition to the stated objectives, as early as 1889 Blavatsky publicly declared that the purpose of establishing the Society was to prepare humanity for the reception of a &quot;World Teacher&quot;: according to the Theosophical doctrine described above, a manifested aspect of an advanced spiritual entity (the Maitreya) that periodically appears on Earth in order to direct the evolution of humankind. The mission of these reputedly regularly appearing emissaries is to practically translate, in a way and language understood by contemporary humanity, the knowledge required to propel it to a higher evolutionary stage.

If the present attempt, in the form of our Society, succeeds better than its predecessors have done, then it will be in existence as an organized, living and healthy body when the time comes for the effort of the 20th century. The general condition of men&#x27;s minds and hearts will have been improved and purified by the spread of its teachings, and, as I have said, their prejudices and dogmatic illusions will have been, to some extent at least, removed. Not only so, but besides a large and accessible literature ready to men&#x27;s hands, the next impulse will find a numerous and &quot;united body&quot; of people ready to welcome the new torch-bearer of Truth. He will find the minds of men prepared for his message, a language ready for him in which to clothe the new truths he brings, an organization awaiting his arrival, which will remove the merely mechanical, material obstacles and difficulties from his path. Think how much one, to whom such an opportunity is given, could accomplish. Measure it by comparison with what the Theosophical Society actually &quot;has&quot; achieved in the last fourteen years, without &quot;any&quot; of these advantages and surrounded by hosts of hindrances which would not hamper the new leader.

This was repeated by then prominent Theosophist Annie Besant in 1896, five years after Blavatsky&#x27;s death. Besant, who became President of the Society in 1907, thought the appearance of the &quot;World Teacher&quot; would happen sooner than the time-frame in Blavatsky&#x27;s writings, who had indicated that it would not take place until the last quarter of the 20th century.

=== Jiddu Krishnamurti===
One of the people who expected the imminent reappearance of the Maitreya as &quot;World Teacher&quot; was Charles Webster Leadbeater, then an influential Theosophist and occultist. In 1909 he &quot;discovered&quot; Jiddu Krishnamurti, an adolescent Indian boy, who he proclaimed as the most suitable candidate for the &quot;vehicle&quot; of the &quot;World Teacher&quot;. Krishnamurti&#x27;s family had relocated next to the Theosophical Society headquarters in Adyar, India, a few months earlier. Following his &quot;discovery&quot;, Krishnamurti was taken under the wing of the Society, and was extensively groomed in preparation for his expected mission.

However, by 1925 Krishnamurti had begun to move away from the course expected of him by the leaders of the Theosophical Society Adyar and by many Theosophists. In 1929 he publicly dissolved the Order of the Star, a worldwide organization created by the leadership of the Theosophical Society to prepare the world for the &quot;Coming of the Maitreya&quot;, and abandoned his assumed role as the &quot;vehicle&quot; for the &quot;World Teacher&quot;. He eventually left the Theosophical Society altogether, yet remained on friendly terms with individual members of the Society. He spent the rest of his life traveling the world as an independent speaker, becoming widely known as an original thinker on spiritual, philosophical, and psychological subjects.

<doc id="200269" wikidata="Q464318" url="?curid=200269" title="Annie Besant">
<text>Annie Besant ( Wood; 1 October 1847 – 20 September 1933) was a British socialist, theosophist, freemason, women&#x27;s rights and Home Rule activist, educationist and campaigner for Indian nationalism. She was an ardent supporter of both Irish and Indian self-rule. She became the first female president of the Indian National Congress in 1917. 

She became a prominent speaker for the National Secular Society (NSS), as well as a writer, and a close friend of Charles Bradlaugh. In 1877 they were prosecuted for publishing a book by birth control campaigner Charles Knowlton. Thereafter, she became involved with union actions, including the Bloody Sunday demonstration and the London matchgirls strike of 1888. She was a leading speaker for both the Fabian Society and the Marxist Social Democratic Federation (SDF). She was also elected to the London School Board for Tower Hamlets, topping the poll, even though few women were qualified to vote at that time.

In 1890 Besant met Helena Blavatsky, and over the next few years her interest in theosophy grew, whilst her interest in secular matters waned. She became a member of the Theosophical Society and a prominent lecturer on the subject. As part of her theosophy-related work, she travelled to India. In 1898 she helped establish the Central Hindu School, and in 1922 she helped establish the Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board in Bombay (today&#x27;s Mumbai), India. The Theosophical Society Auditorium in Hyderabad, Sindh (Sindh) is called Besant Hall in her honor. In 1902, she established the first overseas Lodge of the International Order of Co-Freemasonry, Le Droit Humain. Over the next few years, she established lodges in many parts of the British Empire. In 1907 she became president of the Theosophical Society, whose international headquarters were, by then, located in Adyar, Madras (Chennai).

Besant also became involved in politics in India, joining the Indian National Congress. When World War I broke out in 1914, she helped launch the Home Rule League to campaign for democracy in India, and dominion status within the British Empire. This led to her election as president of the Indian National Congress, in late 1917. In the late 1920s, Besant travelled to the United States with her protégé and adopted son Jiddu Krishnamurti, who she claimed was the new Messiah and incarnation of Buddha. Krishnamurti rejected these claims in 1929. After the war, she continued to campaign for Indian independence and for the causes of theosophy, until her death in 1933.

==Early life==
Annie Wood was born on 1 October 1847 in London, the daughter of William Burton Persse Wood (1816–1852) and his wife Emily Roche Morris (died 1874). Her father was English, attended Trinity College Dublin, and attained a medical degree; her mother was an Irish Catholic. Her paternal grandfather Robert Wright Wood was a brother of Sir Matthew Wood, 1st Baronet.

Wood&#x27;s father died when she was five years old, leaving a son, Henry Trueman Wood, and one daughter. Her mother supported Henry&#x27;s education at Harrow School, by running a boarding house there. Annie was fostered by Ellen Marryat, sister of the author Frederick Marryat, who ran a school at Charmouth, until age 16. She returned to her mother at Harrow self-confident, aware of a sense of duty to society, and under the influence of the Tractarians. As a young woman, she was also able to travel in Europe.

In summer 1867, Wood and her mother stayed at Pendleton near Manchester with the radical solicitor William Prowting Roberts, who questioned Wood&#x27;s political assumptions. In December of that year, at age 20, Annie married the cleric Frank Besant (1840–1917), younger brother of Walter Besant, an evangelical, serious Anglican.

==Failure of the marriage==
The Rev. Frank Besant was a graduate of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, ordained priest in 1866, but had no living: in 1866 he was teaching at Stockwell Grammar School as second master, and in 1867 he moved to teach at Cheltenham College as assistant master. In 1872, he became vicar of Sibsey in Lincolnshire, a benefice in the gift of the Lord Chancellor—who was Lord Hatherley, a Wood family connection, son of Sir Matthew Wood, 1st Baronet. The Besant family, with their two children, Arthur and Mabel, moved to Sibsey, but the marriage was already under strain. As Besant wrote in her &quot;Autobiography&quot;, &quot;we were an ill-matched pair&quot;.

Money was short and Frank Besant was stingy. Annie Besant was sure a third child would impose too much on the family finances. She wrote short stories, books for children, and articles, the money she earned being controlled by her husband.

Besant began to question her own faith, after her daughter Mabel was seriously ill in 1871. She consulted Edward Bouverie Pusey: by post he gave her advice along orthodox, Bampton Lecture lines, and in person he sharply reprimanded her unorthodox theological tendencies. She attended in London, with her mother, a service at St George&#x27;s Hall given by the heterodox cleric Charles Voysey, in autumn 1871, and struck up an acquaintance with the Voyseys, reading in &quot;theistic&quot; authors such as Theodore Parker and Francis Newman on Voysey&#x27;s recommendation. Voysey also introduced Besant to the freethinker and publisher Thomas Scott. Encouraged by Scott, Besant wrote an anonymous pamphlet &quot;On the Deity of Jesus of Nazareth&quot;, by &quot;the wife of a beneficed clergyman&quot;, which appeared in 1872. Ellen Dana Conway, wife of Moncure Conway befriended Annie at this time.

The Besants made an effort to repair the marriage. The tension came to a head when Annie Besant refused to attend Communion, which Frank Besant demanded, now fearing for his own reputation and position in the Church. In 1873 she left him and went to London. She had a temporary place to stay, with Moncure Conway. The Scotts found her a small house in Colby Road, Upper Norwood.

The couple were legally separated and Annie Besant took her daughter Mabel with her, the agreement of 25 October 1873 giving her custody. Annie remained Mrs. Besant for the rest of her life. At first, she was able to keep contact with both children and to have Mabel live with her; she also got a small allowance from her husband. In 1878 Frank Besant successfully argued her unfitness, after Annie Besant&#x27;s public campaigning on contraception, and had custody from then of both children. Later, Annie Besant was reconciled with her son and daughter. Her son Arthur Digby Besant (1869–1960) was President of the Institute of Actuaries, 1924–26, and wrote &quot;The Besant Pedigree&quot; (1930). Initially in London, Besant attempted to support her daughter, her mother (who died the following year) and herself with needlework.
==Reformer and secularist==
Besant began in 1874 to write for the &quot;National Reformer&quot;, the organ of the National Secular Society (NSS), run by Charles Bradlaugh. She also continued to write for Thomas Scott&#x27;s small press. On the account given by W. T. Stead, Besant had encountered the &quot;National Reformer&quot; on sale in the shop of Edward Truelove. Besant had heard of Bradlaugh from Moncure Conway. She wrote to Bradlaugh and was accepted as an NSS member. She first heard him speak on 2 August 1874.
Through Bradlaugh, Besant met and became a supporter of Joseph Arch, the farmworkers&#x27; leader.

Her career as a platform speaker began on 25 August 1874, with topic &quot;The Political Status of Women&quot;. The lecture was at the Co-operative Hall, Castle Street, Long Acre in Covent Garden. It was followed in September by an invitation from Moncure Conway to speak at his Camden Town church on &quot;The True Basis of Morality&quot;. Besant published an essay under this title, in 1882. She was a prolific writer and a powerful orator. She addressed causes including freedom of thought, women&#x27;s rights, secularism, birth control, Fabian socialism and workers&#x27; rights. Margaret Cole called her &quot;the finest woman orator and organiser of her day&quot;.

===Criticism of Christianity===
Besant opined that for centuries the leaders of Christian thought spoke of women as a necessary evil and that the greatest saints of the Church were those who despised women the most, &quot;Against the teachings of eternal torture, of the vicarious atonement, of the infallibility of the Bible, I leveled all the strength of my brain and tongue, and I exposed the history of the Christian Church with unsparing hand, its persecutions, its religious wars, its cruelties, its oppressions.&quot; In the section named &quot;Its Evidences Unreliable&quot; of her work &quot;Christianity&quot;, Besant presents the case of why the Gospels are not authentic: &quot;before about A.D. 180 there is no trace of gospels among the Christians.&quot;

===&quot;The Fruits of Philosophy&quot;===
Besant and Bradlaugh set up the Freethought Publishing Company at the beginning of 1877; it followed the 1876 prosecution of Charles Watts, and they carried on his work. They became household names later that year, when they published &quot;Fruits of Philosophy&quot;, a book by the American birth-control campaigner Charles Knowlton. It claimed that working-class families could never be happy until they were able to decide how many children they wanted. It also suggested ways to limit the size of their families. The Knowlton book was highly controversial and was vigorously opposed by the Church. Besant and Bradlaugh proclaimed in the &quot;National Reformer&quot;:

We intend to publish nothing we do not think we can morally defend. All that we publish we shall defend.

The pair were arrested and put on trial for publishing the Knowlton book. They were found guilty but released pending appeal. The trial became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot;, and ultimately the verdict was overturned on a technical legal point.

Besant was then instrumental in founding the Malthusian League, reviving a name coined earlier by Bradlaugh. It would go on to advocate for the abolition of penalties for the promotion of contraception. Besant and Bradlaugh supported the Malthusian League for some 12 years. They were concerned with birth control, but were not neo-Malthusians in the sense of convinced believers in the tradition of Thomas Malthus and his demographic theories. Besant did advocate population control as an antidote to the struggle for survival. She became the secretary of the League, with Charles Robert Drysdale as President. In time the League veered towards eugenics, and it was from the outset an individualist organisation, also for many members supportive of a social conservatism that was not Besant&#x27;s view. Her pamphlet &quot;The Law of Population&quot; (1878) sold well.

===Radical causes===
Besant was a leading member of the National Secular Society alongside Charles Bradlaugh. She attacked the status of the Church of England as established church. The NSS argued for a secular state and an end to the special status of Christianity and allowed her to act as one of its public speakers. On 6 March 1881 she spoke at the opening of Leicester Secular Society&#x27;s new Secular Hall in Humberstone Gate, Leicester. The other speakers were George Jacob Holyoake, Harriet Law and Bradlaugh.

Bradlaugh was elected to Parliament in 1881. Because of his atheism, he asked to be allowed to affirm, rather than swear the oath of loyalty. It took more than six years before the matter was completely resolved, in Bradlaugh&#x27;s favour, after a series of by-elections and court appearances. He was an individualist and opposed to socialism in any form. While he defended free speech, he was very cautious about encouraging working-class militancy.

Edward Aveling, a rising star in the National Secular Society, tutored Besant during 1879, and she went on to a degree course at London University. Then, 1879 to 1882, she was a student of physical sciences at Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institution. Embarrassed by her activist reputation, the Institution omitted her name from the published list of graduands, and mailed her certificates to her. When Aveling in a speech in 1884 announced he had become a socialist after five years close study, Besant argued that his politics over that whole period had been aligned with Bradlaugh&#x27;s and her own. Aveling and Eleanor Marx joined the Social Democratic Federation, followers of Marxism, and then the Socialist League, a small Marxist splinter group which formed around the artist William Morris. In 1883 Besant started her own periodical, &quot;Our Corner&quot;. It was a literary and in time a socialist monthly, and published George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s novel &quot;The Irrational Knot&quot; in serial form.

Meanwhile, Besant built close contacts with the Irish Home Rulers and supported them in her newspaper columns during what are considered crucial years, when the Irish nationalists were forming an alliance with Liberals and Radicals. Besant met the leaders of the Irish home rule movement. In particular, she got to know Michael Davitt, who wanted to mobilise the Irish peasantry through a Land War, a direct struggle against the landowners. She spoke and wrote in favour of Davitt and his Land League many times over the coming decades.

===Personal life===
Bradlaugh&#x27;s family circumstances changed in May 1877 with the death of his wife Susannah, an alcoholic who had left him for James Thomson. His two children, Alice then aged 21, and Hypatia then 19, returned to live with him from his in-laws. He had been able to take a house in St John&#x27;s Wood in February of that year, at 20 Circus Road, near Besant. They continued what had become a close friendship.

==Fabian Society 1885–1890==
Besant made an abrupt public change in her political views, at the 1885 New Year&#x27;s Day meeting of the London Dialectical Society, founded by Joseph Hiam Levy to promote individualist views. It followed a noted public debate at St. James&#x27;s Hall on 17 April 1884, on &quot;Will Socialism Benefit the English People?&quot;, in which Bradlaugh had put individualist views, against the Marxist line of Henry Hyndman. On that occasion Besant still supported Bradlaugh. While Bradlaugh may have had the better of the debate, followers then began to migrate into left-wing politics. George Bernard Shaw was the speaker on 1 January 1885, talking on socialism, but, instead of the expected criticism from Besant, he saw her opposing his opponent. Shaw then sponsored Besant to join the Fabian Society.

The Fabians were defining political goals, rejecting anarchism in 1886, and forming the Fabian Parliamentary League, with both Besant and Shaw on its Council which promoted political candidacy. Unemployment was a central issue of the time, and in 1887 some of the London unemployed started to hold protests in Trafalgar Square. Besant agreed to appear as a speaker at a meeting on 13 November. The police tried to stop the assembly, fighting broke out, and troops were called. Many were hurt, one man died, and hundreds were arrested; Besant offered herself for arrest, an offer disregarded by the police. The events became known as Bloody Sunday. Besant threw herself into organising legal aid for the jailed workers and support for their families. In its aftermath the Law and Liberty League, defending freedom of expression, was formed by Besant and others, and Besant became editor of &quot;The Link&quot;, its journal.

Besant&#x27;s involvement in the London matchgirls strike of 1888 came after a Fabian Society talk that year on female labour by Clementina Black. Besant wrote in &quot;The Link&quot; about conditions at the Bryant &amp; May match factory. She was drawn further into this battle of the &quot;New Unionism&quot; by a young socialist, Herbert Burrows, who had made contact with workers at the factory, in Bow. They were mainly young women, were very poorly paid, and subject to occupational disease, such as Phossy jaw caused by the chemicals used in match manufacture. Louise Raw in &quot;Striking a Light&quot; (2011) has, however, contested the historiography of the strike, stating that &quot;A proper examination of the primary evidence about the strike makes it impossible to continue to believe that Annie Besant led it.&quot;

William Morris played some part in converting Besant to Marxism, but it was to the Social Democratic Federation of Hyndman, not his Socialist League, that she turned in 1888. She remained a member for a number of years and became one of its leading speakers. She was still a member of the Fabian Society, the two movements being compatible at the time. Besant was elected to the London School Board in 1888. Women at that time were not able to take part in parliamentary politics but had been brought into the London local electorate in 1881. Besant drove about with a red ribbon in her hair, speaking at meetings. &quot;No more hungry children&quot;, her manifesto proclaimed. She combined her socialist principles with feminism:

&quot;I ask the electors to vote for me, and the non-electors to work for me because women are wanted on the Board and there are too few women candidates.&quot; 

From the early 1880s Besant had also been an important feminist leader in London, with Alice Vickery, Ellen Dana Moncure and Millicent Fawcett. This group, at the South Place Ethical Society, had a national standing. She frequented the home of Richard and Emmeline Pankhurst on Russell Square, and Emmeline had participated in the matchgirl organisation. Besant came out on top of the poll in Tower Hamlets, with over 15,000 votes. She wrote in the &quot;National Reformer&quot;:

 &quot;Ten years ago, under a cruel law, Christian bigotry robbed me of my little child. Now the care of the 763,680 children of London is placed partly in my hands.&quot;

Financial constraints meant that Besant closed down both &quot;Our Corner&quot; and &quot;The Link&quot; at the end of 1888.

Besant was further involved in the London dock strike of 1889. The dockers, casual workers who were employed by the day, were led by Ben Tillett in a struggle for the &quot;Dockers&#x27; Tanner&quot;. Besant helped Tillett draw up the union&#x27;s rules and played an important part in the meetings and agitation which built up the organisation. She spoke for the dockers at public meetings and on street corners. Like the match-girls, the dockers won public support for their struggle, and the strike was won.

==Theosophy==

In 1889, Besant was asked to write a review for the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; on &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot;, a book by H. P. Blavatsky. After reading it, she sought an interview with its author, meeting Blavatsky in Paris. In this way, she was converted to Theosophy. She allowed her membership of the Fabian Society to lapse (1890) and broke her links with the Marxists.

In her &quot;Autobiography&quot;, Besant follows her chapter on &quot;Socialism&quot; with &quot;Through Storm to Peace&quot;, the peace of Theosophy. In 1888, she described herself as &quot;marching toward the Theosophy&quot; that would be the &quot;glory&quot; of her life. Besant had found the economic side of life lacking a spiritual dimension, so she searched for a belief based on &quot;Love&quot;. She found this in Theosophy, so she joined the Theosophical Society, a move that distanced her from Bradlaugh and other former activist co-workers. When Blavatsky died in 1891, Besant was left as one of the leading figures in theosophy and in 1893 she represented it at the Chicago World Fair.

In 1893, soon after becoming a member of the Theosophical Society, she went to India for the first time. After a dispute the American section split away into an independent organisation. The original society, then led by Henry Steel Olcott and Besant, is today based in Chennai, India, and is known as the Theosophical Society Adyar. Following the split, Besant devoted much of her energy not only to the society but also to India&#x27;s freedom and progress. Besant Nagar, a neighbourhood near the Theosophical Society in Chennai, is named in her honour.

In 1893, she was a representative of The Theosophical Society at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago. The World Parliament is famous in India because Indian monk Swami Vivekananda addressed the same event.

In 1895, together with the founder-president of the Theosophical Society, Henry Steel Olcott, as well as Marie Musaeus Higgins and Peter De Abrew, she was instrumental in developing the Buddhist school, Musaeus College, in Colombo on the island of Sri Lanka.

===Co-freemasonry===
Besant saw freemasonry, in particular Co-Freemasonry, as an extension of her interest in the rights of women and the greater brotherhood of man and saw co-freemasonry as a &quot;movement which practised true brotherhood, in which women and men worked side by side for the perfecting of humanity. She immediately wanted to be admitted to this organisation&quot;, known now as the International Order of Freemasonry for Men and Women, &quot;Le Droit Humain&quot;.

The link was made in 1902 by the theosophist Francesca Arundale, who accompanied Besant to Paris, along with six friends. &quot;They were all initiated, passed, and raised into the first three degrees and Annie returned to England, bearing a Charter and founded there the first Lodge of International Mixed Masonry, Le Droit Humain.&quot; Besant eventually became the Order&#x27;s Most Puissant Grand Commander and was a major influence in the international growth of the Order.

===President of Theosophical Society===

Besant met fellow theosophist Charles Webster Leadbeater in London in April 1894. They became close co-workers in the theosophical movement and would remain so for the rest of their lives. Leadbeater claimed clairvoyance and reputedly helped Besant become clairvoyant herself in the following year. In a letter dated 25 August 1895 to Francisca Arundale, Leadbeater narrates how Besant became clairvoyant. Together they clairvoyantly investigated the universe, matter, thought-forms, and the history of mankind, and co-authored a book called &quot;Occult Chemistry&quot;.

In 1906 Leadbeater became the centre of controversy when it emerged that he had advised the practice of masturbation to some boys under his care and spiritual instruction. Leadbeater stated he had encouraged the practice to keep the boys celibate, which was considered a prerequisite for advancement on the spiritual path. Because of the controversy, he offered to resign from the Theosophical Society in 1906, which was accepted. The next year Besant became president of the society and in 1908, with her express support, Leadbeater was readmitted to the society. Leadbeater went on to face accusations of improper relations with boys, but none of the accusations were ever proven and Besant never deserted him.

Until Besant&#x27;s presidency, the society had as one of its foci Theravada Buddhism and the island of Sri Lanka, where Henry Olcott did the majority of his useful work. Under Besant&#x27;s leadership there was more stress on the teachings of &quot;The Aryavarta&quot;, as she called central India, as well as on esoteric Christianity.

Besant set up a new school for boys, the Central Hindu College (CHC) at Banaras which was formed on underlying theosophical principles, and which counted many prominent theosophists in its staff and faculty. Its aim was to build a new leadership for India. The students spent 90 minutes a day in prayer and studied religious texts, but they also studied modern science. It took 3 years to raise the money for the CHC, most of which came from Indian princes. In April 1911, Besant met Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya and they decided to unite their forces and work for a common Hindu University at Banaras. Besant and fellow trustees of the Central Hindu College also agreed to the Government of India&#x27;s precondition that the college should become a part of the new University. The Banaras Hindu University started functioning from 1 October 1917 with the Central Hindu College as its first constituent college.

Blavatsky had stated in 1889 that the main purpose of establishing the society was to prepare humanity for the future reception of a &quot;torch-bearer of Truth&quot;, an emissary of a hidden Spiritual Hierarchy that, according to theosophists, guides the evolution of mankind. This was repeated by Besant as early as 1896; Besant came to believe in the imminent appearance of the &quot;emissary&quot;, who was identified by theosophists as the so-called &quot;World Teacher&quot;.

===&quot;World Teacher&quot; project===
In 1909, soon after Besant&#x27;s assumption of the presidency, Leadbeater &quot;discovered&quot; fourteen-year-old Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895–1986), a South Indian boy who had been living, with his father and brother, on the grounds of the headquarters of the Theosophical Society at Adyar, and declared him the probable &quot;vehicle&quot; for the expected &quot;World Teacher&quot;. The &quot;discovery&quot; and its objective received widespread publicity and attracted a worldwide following, mainly among theosophists. It also started years of upheaval and contributed to splits in the Theosophical Society and doctrinal schisms in theosophy. Following the discovery, Jiddu Krishnamurti and his younger brother Nityananda (&quot;Nitya&quot;) were placed under the care of theosophists and Krishnamurti was extensively groomed for his future mission as the new vehicle for the &quot;World Teacher&quot;. Besant soon became the boys&#x27; legal guardian with the consent of their father, who was very poor and could not take care of them. However, his father later changed his mind and began a legal battle to regain guardianship, against the will of the boys. Early in their relationship, Krishnamurti and Besant had developed a very close bond and he considered her a surrogate mother – a role she happily accepted. (His biological mother had died when he was ten years old.)

In 1929, twenty years after his &quot;discovery&quot;, Krishnamurti, who had grown disenchanted with the &quot;World Teacher Project&quot;, repudiated the role that many theosophists expected him to fulfil. He dissolved the Order of the Star in the East, an organisation founded to assist the World Teacher in his mission, and eventually left the Theosophical Society and theosophy at large. He spent the rest of his life travelling the world as an unaffiliated speaker, becoming in the process widely known as an original, independent thinker on philosophical, psychological, and spiritual subjects. His love for Besant never waned, as also was the case with Besant&#x27;s feelings towards him; concerned for his wellbeing after he declared his independence, she had purchased of land near the Theosophical Society estate which later became the headquarters of the Krishnamurti Foundation India.

==Home Rule movement==
As early as 1902 Besant had written that &quot;India is not ruled for the prospering of the people, but rather for the profit of her conquerors, and her sons are being treated as a conquered race.&quot; She encouraged Indian national consciousness, attacked caste and child marriage, and worked effectively for Indian education. Along with her theosophical activities, Besant continued to actively participate in political matters. She had joined the Indian National Congress. As the name suggested, this was originally a debating body, which met each year to consider resolutions on political issues. Mostly it demanded more of a say for middle-class Indians in British Indian government. It had not yet developed into a permanent mass movement with a local organisation. About this time her co-worker Leadbeater moved to Sydney.

In 1914, World War I broke out, and Britain asked for the support of its Empire in the fight against Germany. Echoing an Irish nationalist slogan, Besant declared, &quot;England&#x27;s need is India&#x27;s opportunity&quot;. As editor of the &quot;New India&quot; newspaper, she attacked the colonial government of India and called for clear and decisive moves towards self-rule. As with Ireland, the government refused to discuss any changes while the war lasted.

In 1916, Besant launched the All India Home Rule League along with Lokmanya Tilak, once again modelling demands for India on Irish nationalist practices. This was the first political party in India to have regime change as its main goal. Unlike the Congress itself, the League worked all year round. It built a structure of local branches, enabling it to mobilise demonstrations, public meetings, and agitations. In June 1917, Besant was arrested and interned at a hill station, where she defiantly flew a red and green flag. The Congress and the Muslim League together threatened to launch protests if she were not set free; Besant&#x27;s arrest had created a focus for protest.

The government was forced to give way and to make vague but significant concessions. It was announced that the ultimate aim of British rule was Indian self-government, and moves in that direction were promised. Besant was freed in September 1917, welcomed by crowds all over India, and in December she took over as president of the Indian National Congress for a year. Both Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi spoke of Besant&#x27;s influence with admiration.

After the war, a new leadership of the Indian National Congress emerged around Mahatma Gandhi – one of those who had written to demand Besant&#x27;s release. He was a lawyer who had returned from leading Asians in a peaceful struggle against racism in South Africa. Jawaharlal Nehru, Gandhi&#x27;s closest collaborator, had been educated by a theosophist tutor.

The new leadership was committed to action that was both militant and non-violent, but there were differences between them and Besant. Despite her past, she was not happy with their socialist leanings. Until the end of her life, however, she continued to campaign for India&#x27;s independence, not only in India but also on speaking tours of Britain. In her own version of Indian dress, she remained a striking presence on speakers&#x27; platforms. She produced a torrent of letters and articles demanding independence.

==Later years and death==
Besant tried as a person, theosophist, and president of the Theosophical Society, to accommodate Krishnamurti&#x27;s views into her life, without success; she vowed to personally follow him in his new direction although she apparently had trouble understanding both his motives and his new message. The two remained friends until the end of her life.

In 1931, she became ill in India.

Besant died on 20 September 1933, at age 85, in Adyar, Madras Presidency, British India. Her body was cremated.

She was survived by her daughter, Mabel. After her death, colleagues Jiddu Krishnamurti, Aldous Huxley, Guido Ferrando, and Rosalind Rajagopal, built the Happy Valley School in California, now renamed the Besant Hill School of Happy Valley in her honour.

==Works==
Besides being a prolific writer, Besant was a &quot;practised stump orator&quot; who gave sixty-six public lectures in one year. She also engaged in public debates.

==Recognition in popular media==
On 1 October 2015, search engine Google commemorated Annie Besant with a Doodle on her 168th birth anniversary. Google commented: &quot;A fierce advocate of Indian self-rule, Annie Besant loved the language, and over a lifetime of vigorous study cultivated tremendous abilities as a writer and orator. She published mountains of essays, wrote a textbook, curated anthologies of classic literature for young adults and eventually became editor of the New India newspaper, a periodical dedicated to the cause of Indian Autonomy&quot;.

In his book, &quot;Rebels Against the Raj&quot;, Ramchandra Guha tells the story of how Besant and six other foreigners served India in its quest for independence from the British Raj.

Besant appears as a character in the children&#x27;s novel &quot;Billy and the Match Girl&quot; by Paul Haston, about the matchgirls&#x27; strike.

<doc id="200281" wikidata="Q1267947" url="?curid=200281" title="An Shigao">
<text>An Shigao (, Korean: An Sego, Japanese: An Seikō, Vietnamese: An Thế Cao) (fl. c. 148–180 CE) was an early Buddhist missionary to China, and the earliest known translator of Indian Buddhist texts into Chinese. According to legend, he was a prince of Parthia, nicknamed the &quot;Parthian Marquess&quot;, who renounced his claim to the royal throne of Parthia in order to serve as a Buddhist missionary monk in China.

==Origins==
The prefix &quot;An&quot; in An Shigao&#x27;s name has raised many questions and hypotheses as to his origin and story. Some believe that it is an abbreviation of &quot;Anxi&quot;, the Chinese name given to the regions ruled by the Parthian Empire. Most visitors from that country who took a Chinese name received the &quot;An&quot; prefix to indicate their origin in &quot;Anxi&quot;.It is still unknown whether he was a monk or layperson or whether he should be considered a follower of the Sarvāstivāda or Mahāyāna, though affiliation with these two groups need not be viewed as mutually exclusive. The unresolved mystery of who An Shigao was is studied in the academic work of Antonino Forte.

An Shigao migrated eastward into China, settling at the Han capital of Luoyang in 148 CE, where he produced a substantial number of translations of Indian Buddhist texts and attracted a devoted community of followers. More than a dozen works by An Shigao are currently extant, including texts dealing with meditation, abhidharma, and basic Buddhist doctrines. An Shigao&#x27;s corpus does not contain any Mahāyāna scriptures, though he himself is regularly referred to as a &quot;bodhisattva&quot; in early Chinese sources. Scholarly studies of his translations have shown that they are most closely affiliated with the Sarvāstivāda school.

==Works==
In Erik Zürcher&#x27;s pioneering studies of the works attributed to An Shigao, he uses both the information provided by later Chinese catalogues and internal stylistic evidence to conclude that only sixteen of the nearly two hundred translations attributed to him by later Chinese catalogues may be regarded as authentic. Stefano Zacchetti has proposed, in light of recent research, that thirteen of the sixteen texts originally listed by Zürcher can be reliably ascribed to An Shigao. These thirteen are (listed by Taishō number):

T 13 Chang Ahan shi bao fa jing 長阿含十報法經
T 14 Ren ben yu sheng jing 人本欲生經
T 31 Yiqie liu sheshou yin jing 一切流攝守因經
T 32 Si di jing 四諦經
T 36 Ben xiang yi zhi jing 本相猗致經
T 48 Shi fa fei fa jing 是法非法經
T 57 Lou fenbu jing 漏分佈經
T 98 Pu fa yi jing 普法義經
T 112 Ba zheng dao jing 八正道經
T 150a Qi chu san guan jing 七處三觀經
T 603 Yin chi ru jing 陰持入經
T 607 Dao di jing 道地經
T 1508 Ahan koujie shi&#x27;er yinyuan jing 阿含口解十二因緣經

The remaining three translations enumerated by Zürcher that (according to Zacchetti) should be reconsidered are:

T 602 Da anban shouyi jing 大安般守意經
T 605 Chan xing fa xiang jing 禪行法想經
T 792 Fa shou chen jing 法受塵經

Recent scholarship has proposed a number of additional texts that may be attributed to An Shigao. Paul Harrison has provided evidence that An Shigao translated the previously anonymous collection of saṃyuktāgama sutras, &quot;Za ahan jing&quot; (Taishō 101). Stefano Zacchetti has suggested that, though initially considered inauthentic according to Zürcher&#x27;s conservative criteria, Taishō 1557, &quot;Apitan wu fa xing jing&quot; , may indeed be the work of An Shigao.

Two manuscripts discovered by Kajiura Susumu in 1999 in the collection of the Kongōji in Osaka Prefecture, Japan, present four heretofore unknown works which, based on their apparent antiquity, may be attributable to An Shigao. The first three of these texts are related to meditation practices such as &quot;ānāpānasmṛti&quot; (&quot;mindfulness of breathing&quot;) and the &quot;twelve gates&quot;. The fourth appears to be a record of an oral commentary on topics covered in the preceding texts.

Another &quot;Anxi&quot; translator, a layman named An Xuan, was a disciple of An Shigao. An Xuan also worked in Luoyang (together with a Chinese collaborator, Yan Fotiao), producing a translation of a Mahāyāna scripture, the Ugraparipṛcchā Sūtra (in Chinese, the Fajing jing, Taishō no. 322) c. 181 CE.

<doc id="200282" wikidata="Q216243" url="?curid=200282" title="Nalanda mahavihara">
<text>Nalanda (IAST: , ) was a renowned Buddhist &quot;mahavihara&quot; (great monastery) in ancient and medieval Magadha (modern-day Bihar), eastern India. Widely considered to be among the greatest centres of learning in the ancient world, and often referred to as &quot;the world&#x27;s first residential university&quot;, it was located near the city of Rajagriha (now Rajgir), roughly southeast of Pataliputra (now Patna). Operating for almost a thousand years from 427 CE until around 1400 CE, Nalanda played a vital role in promoting the patronage of arts and academics during the 5th and 6th century CE, a period that has since been described as the &quot;Golden Age of India&quot; by scholars. 

Nalanda was established by emperor Kumaragupta I of the Gupta Empire around 427 CE, and was supported by numerous Indian and Javanese patrons – both Buddhists and non-Buddhists. Nalanda continued to thrive with the support of the rulers of the Pala Empire (r. 750–1161 CE). After the fall of the Palas, the monks of Nalanda were patronised by the Pithipatis of Bodh Gaya. Nalanda was attacked and burnt by Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khilji (c. 1200), but it managed to remain operational for decades (or possibly even centuries) following the raids. 

Over some 750 years, Nalanda&#x27;s faculty included some of the most revered scholars of Mahayana Buddhism. The historian William Dalrymple, said of Nalanda that &quot;at its apex, it was the undisputed scholarly centre of the Mahayana Buddhist world&quot;. The faculty and students associated with the monastery included Dharmapala, Nagarjuna, Dharmakirti, Asanga, Vasubandhu, Chandrakirti, Xuanzang, Śīlabhadra and Vajrabodhi. The curriculum of Nalanda included major Buddhist philosophies like Madhyamaka, Yogachara and Sarvastivada, as well as other subjects like the Vedas, grammar, medicine, logic, mathematics, astronomy and alchemy. The mahavihara had a renowned library that was a key source for the Sanskrit texts that were transmitted to East Asia by pilgrims like Xuanzang and Yijing. Many texts composed at Nalanda played an important role in the development of Mahayana and Vajrayana. They include the works of Dharmakirti, the Sanskrit text &quot;Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra&quot; of Shantideva, and the &quot;Mahavairocana Tantra&quot;. 

The ancient site of Nalanda is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2010, the Government of India passed a resolution to revive the ancient university, and a contemporary institute, Nālandā University, was established at Rajgir. It has been listed as an Institute of National Importance by the Government of India.

==Location==
Nalanda is about north of the city of Rajgir and about southeast of Patna, connected via NH 31, 20 and 120 to India&#x27;s highway network. It is about northeast of Bodh Gaya – another important Buddhist site in Bihar. The Nalanda archaeological site is spread over a large area to the northwest of Bargaon (Nalanda) village, and is between the historical manmade lakes Gidhi, Panashokar and Indrapuskarani. On the south bank of the Indrapushkarani lake is the Nava Nalanda Mahavihara – a university founded in its memory. Similarly on the south west bank of the Indrapushkarani lake is Nalanda Open University, the state university named after the ancient Nalanda University.

==Etymology==
&quot;Mahavihara&quot; () is the Sanskrit and Pali term for a great vihāra (centre of learning or Buddhist monastery) and is used to describe a monastic complex of viharas.

According to the early 7th-century Tang dynasty Chinese pilgrim, Xuanzang, the local tradition explains that the name (Hindi/Magahi: नालन्दा) came from a &quot;nāga&quot; (serpent deity in Indian religions) whose name was &quot;Nalanda&quot;. He offers an alternate meaning &quot;charity without intermission&quot;, from &quot;na-alam-da&quot;; however, this split does not mean this. Hiranand Sastri, an archaeologist who headed the excavation of the ruins, attributes the name to the abundance of (lotus-stalks) in the area and believes that Nalanda would then represent &quot;the giver of lotus-stalks&quot;.

In some Tibetan sources, including the 17th-century work of Taranatha, Nalanda is referred to as &quot;Nalendra&quot;, and is likely synonymous with Nala, Nalaka, Nalakagrama found in Tibetan literature.

==History ==
=== Early history of the city of Nalanda (1200 BCE–300 CE) ===

Archaeological excavations at sites near Nalanda, such as the Juafardih site about three kilometres away, have yielded black ware and other items. These have been carbon dated to about 1200 BCE. This suggests that the region around Nalanda in Magadha had a human settlement centuries before the birth of the Mahavira and the Buddha.

Early Buddhist texts state that Buddha visited a town near Rajagriha (modern Rajgir – the capital of Magadha) called Nalanda on his peregrinations. He delivered lectures in a nearby mango grove named &quot;Pavarika&quot; and one of his two chief disciples, Shariputra, was born in the area and later attained nirvana there. These Buddhist texts were written down centuries after the death of the Buddha, are not consistent in either the name or the relative locations. For example, texts such as the &quot;Mahasudassana Jataka&quot; states that Nalaka or Nalakagrama is about a yojana (10 miles) from Rajagriha, while texts such as &quot;Mahavastu&quot; call the place Nalanda-gramaka and place it half a yojana away. A Buddhist text &quot;Nikayasamgraha&quot; does state that emperor Ashoka established a &quot;vihara&quot; (monastery) at Nalanda. However, archaeological excavations so far have not yielded any monuments from Ashoka period or from another 600 years after his death.

Chapter 2.7 of the Jaina text &quot;Sutrakritanga&quot; states that Nalanda is a &quot;suburb&quot; of capital Rajagriha, has numerous buildings, and this is where Mahavira (6th/5th century BCE) spent fourteen &quot;varshas&quot; – a term that refers to a traditional retreat during monsoons for the monks in Indian religions. This is corroborated in the &quot;Kalpasutra&quot;, another cherished text in Jainism. However, other than the mention of Nalanda, Jaina texts do not provide further details, nor were they written down for nearly a millennium after Mahavira&#x27;s death. Like the Buddhist texts, this has raised questions about reliability and whether the current Nalanda is same as the one in Jaina texts. According to Scharfe, though the Buddhist and Jaina texts generate problems with place identification, it is &quot;virtually certain&quot; that the modern Nalanda is near or the site these texts are referring to.

Sariputta, a prominent disciple of the Buddha, was born and died in Nalanda. King Ashoka is said to have built the Sariputta stupa in Nalanda to honour him, and Sariputta&#x27;s relics were also enshrined in stupas at Sanchi and Mathura.

==== Faxian visit (399–412 CE) ====
When Faxian, a Chinese Buddhist pilgrim monk, visited the city of Nalanda, there probably was no university yet. Faxian had come to India to acquire Buddhist texts, and spent 10 years in India in the early fifth century, visiting major Buddhist pilgrimage sites including the Nalanda area. He also wrote a travelogue, which inspired other Chinese and Korean Buddhists to visit India over the centuries; in it he mentions many Buddhist monasteries and monuments across India. However, he makes no mention of any monastery or university at Nalanda even though he was looking for Sanskrit texts and took a large number of them from other parts of India back to China. Combined with a lack of any archaeological discoveries of pre-400 CE monuments in Nalanda, the silence in Faxian&#x27;s memoir suggests that Nalanda monastery-university did not exist around 400 CE.

=== Foundation (5th century) ===

Nalanda&#x27;s dateable history begins in the 5th century. A seal discovered at the site identifies a monarch named Shakraditya ( - r. c. 415–455 CE) as its founder and attributes the foundation of a sangharama (monastery) at the site to him. This is corroborated by the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang travelogue. The tradition of formalised Vedic learning &quot;helped to inspire the formation of large teachings centres,&quot; such as Nalanda, Taxila, and Vikramashila.
In the Indian tradition and texts, kings were called by many epithets and names. Scholars such as Andrea Pinkney and Hartmut Scharfe conclude that Shakraditya is same as Kumaragupta I. He was one of the kings in the Hindu dynasty of the Guptas. Further, numismatic evidence discovered at Nalanda corroborate that Kumaragupta I was the founder patron of the Nalanda monastery-university.

His successors, Budhagupta, Tathagatagupta, Baladitya, and Vajra, later extended and expanded the institution by building additional monasteries and temples. Nalanda, thus flourished through the 5th and 6th centuries under the Guptas. These Gupta-era contributions to Nalanda are corroborated by the numerous Buddhist and Hindu seals, artwork, iconography and inscriptions discovered at Nalanda, which are in the Gupta-style and Gupta-era scripts. During this period, the Gupta kings were not the only patrons of Nalanda. They reflect a broad and religiously diverse community of supporters. It is remarkable, states Scharfe, that &quot;many donors were not Buddhists; the emblems on their seals show Lakshmi, Ganesha, Shivalinga and Durga&quot;.

Rulers in northeast India bequeathed villages to help fund Nalanda; the king of Sumatra contributed villages for the monastery&#x27;s endowment. A special fund was also established to support scholars from China.

=== Post-Gupta dynasty (550–750 CE) ===

After the decline of the Guptas, the most notable patron of the Nalanda Mahavihara was Harsha (known as Śīlāditya in some Buddhist records). He was a seventh-century emperor with a capital at Kannauj (Kanyakubja). According to Xuanzang, Harsha was a third generation Hindu king from the Vaishya caste, who built majestic Buddhist viharas, as well as three temples – Buddha, Surya and Shiva, all of the same size. He states (c. 637 CE), &quot;a long succession of kings&quot; had built up Nalanda till &quot;the whole is truly marvellous to behold&quot;.

In accordance with the ancient Indian traditions of supporting temples and monasteries, inscriptions found at Nalanda suggest that it received gifts, including grants of villages by kings to support its work. Harsha himself granted 100 villages and directed 200 households from each of these villages to supply the institution&#x27;s monks with requisite daily supplies such as of rice, butter, and milk. This supported over 1,500 faculty and 10,000 student monks at Nalanda. These numbers, however, may be exaggerated. They are inconsistent with the much lower numbers (over 3000) given by Yijing, another Chinese pilgrim who visited Nalanda a few decades later. According to Asher, while the excavated Nalanda site is large and the number of viharas so far found are impressive, they simply cannot support 10,000 or more student monks. The total number of known rooms and their small size is such that either the number of monks must have been far less than Xuanzang&#x27;s claims or the Nalanda site was many times larger than numerous excavations have so far discovered and what Xuanzang describes.

==== Xuanzang&#x27;s visit (630–643 CE) ====
Xuanzang travelled around India between 630 and 643 CE, visiting Nalanda in 637 and 642, spending a total of around two years at the monastery. He was warmly welcomed in Nalanda where he received the Indian name of Mokshadeva and studied under the guidance of Shilabhadra, the venerable head of the institution at the time. He believed that the aim of his arduous overland journey to India had been achieved as in Shilabhadra he had at last found an incomparable teacher to instruct him in Yogachara, a school of thought that had then only partially been transmitted to China. Besides Buddhist studies, the monk also attended courses in grammar, logic, and Sanskrit, and later also lectured at the Mahavihara.
In the detailed account of his stay at Nalanda, the pilgrim describes the view out of the window of his quarters thus,
Xuanzang returned to China with 657 Sanskrit texts and 150 relics carried by 20 horses in 520 cases. He translated 74 of the texts himself.

==== Yijing&#x27;s visit (673–700 CE) ====
In the thirty years following Xuanzang&#x27;s return, no fewer than eleven travellers from China and Korea are known to have visited Nalanda, including the monk Yijing. Unlike Faxian and Xuanzang, Yijing followed the sea route around Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka. He arrived in 673 CE, and stayed in India for fourteen years, ten of which he spent at the Nalanda Mahavihara. When he returned to China in 695, he had with him 400 Sanskrit texts and 300 grains of Buddha relics which were subsequently translated in China.

Unlike Xuanzang, who also described the geography and culture of seventh-century India, Yijing&#x27;s account primarily concentrates on the practice of Buddhism in India and detailed descriptions of the customs, rules, and regulations of the monks at the monastery. In his chronicle, Yijing notes that revenues from 200 villages (as opposed to 100 in Xuanzang&#x27;s time) had been assigned toward the maintenance of Nalanda. He described there being eight vihara with as many as 300 cells. According to him, Nalanda monastery has numerous daily &quot;Nikaya&quot; procedures and rules for the monks. He gives many examples. In one subsection he explains that the monastery has ten great pools. The morning begins with the &quot;ghanta&quot; (bell) being rung. Monks take their bathing sheets and go to one of these pools. They bathe with their underwear on, then get out slowly to avoid disturbing anyone else. They wipe their bodies, then wrap this 5-foot long and 1.5-foot wide sheet around the waist, change their clothes with this wrap in place. Then rinse, wring and dry the sheet. The entire procedure, says Yijing, is explained in the Buddhist Nikaya procedures. The day must begin with bathing, but bathing after meals is forbidden. The Nalanda Nikaya has many such daily procedures and rituals set out for the monks to follow.

====Korean and Tibetan pilgrims====
In addition to Chinese pilgrims, Buddhist pilgrims from Korea also visited India about the same time as Xuanzang and Yingji. The Chinese travelogues about India became known in the 19th century and have been well published. After the mid-20th century, the Korean pilgrim journeys have come to light. For example, monks such as Kyom-ik began visiting Indian monasteries by the mid-6th century. They too carried Indian texts and translated them, producing 72 &quot;chuan&quot; of translated texts. In the mid-7th century, the Silla (Korean: 신라) monk Hyon-jo visited and stayed at several Indian monasteries, including three years at Nalanda, his visit corroborated by Yingji. He sent his students Hye-ryun and Hyon-gak to Nalanda for studies, the latter died at Nalanda. They adopted Indian names to interact with the fellow students; for example, Hye-ryun was known as Prajnavarman and it is this name that is found in the records. According to Korean records, monks visited India through the ninth century – despite arduous travel challenges – to study at various monasteries, and Nalanda was the most revered.

In and after the 7th century, Tibetan monks such as Thonmi Sambhota came to Nalanda and other Indian monasteries to study, not only Buddhism, but Sanskrit language, grammar and other subjects. Sambhota is credited with applying the principles of Sanskrit and its grammar to remodel Tibetan language and its script. It was after Sambhota&#x27;s first return from Nalanda that the Tibetan king adopted Buddhism and committed to making it the religion of his people. Tibetan monks lived closer to Nepal, Sikkim and eastern India, with simpler travel itineraries than the Koreans and others. Tibetans continued to visit Magadha during the Pala era, and beyond through the 14th century, thereby participated in the crucible of ideas at Nalanda and other monasteries in Bihar and Bengal. However, after the 8th century, it was the esoteric mandala and deities-driven Vajrayana Buddhism that increasingly dominated the exchange.

===Pala dynasty (750–1200 CE)===

The Palas established themselves in eastern regions of India in the mid-8th century and reigned until the last quarter of the 12th century, they were a Buddhist dynasty. However, under the Palas, the traditional Mahayana Buddhism of Nalanda that inspired East Asian pilgrims such as Xuanzang was superseded by the then newly emerging Vajrayana tradition, a Tantra-imbibed, eros- and deity-inclusive esoteric version of Buddhism. Nalanda continued to get support from the Palas, but they subscribed to Vajrayana Buddhism and they were prolific builders of new monasteries on Vajrayana mandala ideas such as those at Jagaddala, Odantapura, Somapura, and Vikramashila. Odantapura was founded by Gopala, the progenitor of the royal line, only from Nalanda. These competing monasteries, some just a few kilometres away from Nalanda likely drew away a number of learned monks from Nalanda.

Inscriptions, literary evidence, seals, and ruined artwork excavated at the Nalanda site suggest that Nalanda remained active and continued to thrive under the Palas. Kings Dharmapala and Devapala were active patrons. A number of 9th-century metallic statues containing references to Devapala have been found in its ruins as well as two notable inscriptions. The first, a copper plate inscription unearthed at Nalanda, details an endowment by the Shailendra King, Balaputradeva of &quot;Suvarnadvipa&quot; (Sumatra in modern-day Indonesia). This Srivijayan king, &quot;attracted by the manifold excellences of Nalanda&quot; had built a monastery there and had requested Devapala to grant the revenue of five villages for its upkeep, a request which was granted. The Ghosrawan inscription is the other inscription from Devapala&#x27;s time and it mentions that he received and patronised a bhikṣu named Viradeva, who had studied all the Vedas in his youth, and who was later elected the head of Nalanda.

Inscriptions issued between the 9th and 12th centuries attest gifts and support to Nalanda for the upkeep of the monastery, maintenance of the monks, copying of palm leaf manuscripts (necessary for preservation given the Indian tropical climate). One inscription also mentions the destruction of a Nalanda library of manuscripts by fire, and support for its restoration. Another 10th-century inscription quotes Bhadracari of the Sautrantikas tradition, attesting the activity of diverse schools of Buddhism at Nalanda. Another Nalanda inscription from the 11th century mentions a gift of &quot;revolving bookcase&quot;.

While the Palas continued to patronise Nalanda liberally, the fame and influence of Nalanda helped the Palas. The Srivijaya kingdom of southeast Asia maintained a direct contact with Nalanda and the Palas, thus influencing the 9th to 12th century art in Sumatra, Java, southern Thailand and regions that actively traded with the Srivijaya kingdom. The influence extended to the Indonesian Shailendra dynasty. The Indonesian bronzes and votive tablets from this period show the creativity of its people, yet the iconographic themes overlap with those found at Nalanda and nearby region. Monks from Indonesia, Myanmar and other parts of southeast Asia came to Nalanda during the Pala rule.

=== Destruction during Turko-Afghan conquest (c. 1200 CE) ===
Archeological excavations in the site during 1920-1921 discovered a thick layer of ashes on the uppermost strata, across many buildings separated by some distance; this suggests that Nalanda was subject to a catastrophic fire. Traditionally, this is held to be arson, blamed upon the troops of Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khalji who had plundered the region c. 1200 CE, and cited to be the leading cause of Nalanda&#x27;s demise – a passage from Minhaj-i-Siraj&#x27;s &quot;Tabaqat-i Nasiri&quot; which actually describes the destruction of Odantapura Vihar (var. Bihar Sharif), a monastery just a few miles from Nalanda, is offered in support. While such a reading is misplaced, it is true that the Nalanda was raided by Khalji.

The Tibetan records are the second source of the events at Nalanda in the late 12th century and much of the 13th century. These were the decades of widespread systematic destruction of monasteries in this region, and historical records in Tibet affirm that monks from Nalanda and nearby monasteries such as the Vikramashila monastery who &quot;survived the slaughter, fled to Tibet&quot;, according to Scharfe. Among the Tibetan records, the most useful is the biography of the Tibetan monk-pilgrim, Dharmasvamin discovered in 1936 and in &quot;bsdus-yig&quot; style, Tibetan script. It is useful because Dharmasvamin met the fleeing monks and famous scholars during his studies from about mid 1200s to 1226, he had learnt Indian languages and Sanskrit, he walked to and stayed in Nepal starting in 1226 and visited Bihar about 1234, including spending one monsoon season in Nalanda. He described the condition in the decades after the sack of Nalanda and other Buddhist monasteries in Magadha-region of India. His account states that the destruction of Nalanda was not an accident or misunderstanding but a part of the widespread destruction of Buddhist monasteries and monuments including a destruction of Bodhgaya. The vast manuscript libraries of Magadha had been mostly lost. Other Tibetan monks and he had shifted to Nepal, as the place to study, copy and move manuscripts to Tibet. According to his account, the Turushka-Qarluq (Turk) conquest extended from about 1193 to 1205, the destruction was systematic with &quot;Turushka soldiers razing a monastery to the ground and throwing the stones into Ganges river&quot;, states Roerich. The fear of persecution was strong in the 1230s, and his colleagues dissuaded him from going to Magadha. According to George Roerich, &quot;his [Chag lo-tsa-ba Chos-rje-dpal, Dharmasvamin] account conveys something of the anxiety of [the Buddhist community of] those days.&quot;

Chapter 10 of Dharmasvamin&#x27;s biography describes Nalanda in &quot;c.&quot; 1235 CE. Dharmasvamin found it &quot;largely damaged and deserted&quot;. Despite the perils, some had re-gathered and resumed the scholastic activities in Nalanda, but at a vastly smaller scale and with donations from a wealthy Brahmin layperson named Jayadeva. The monks were patronised by a local dynasty known as the Pithipatis of Bodh Gaya of which the King, Buddhasena, belonged to. His account states:

While he stayed there for six months under the tutelage of Rahula Shribhadra, Dharmasvamin makes no mention of the legendary library of Nalanda which possibly did not survive the initial wave of Turko-Afghan attacks. He also states that some structures had survived, with &quot;eighty small viharas, built of bricks and many left undamaged&quot; but &quot;there was absolutely no one to look after them&quot;. He recites the arrest of their patron and lay-supporter Jayadeva by Muslim soldiers who threaten to kill him for honouring (supporting) the monks of Nalanda. Jayadeva sends them a message that the Turushka soldiers are sure to kill &quot;Guru [Rahulasribhadra] and his disciples&quot; and they should &quot;flee!&quot;.

Dharmasvamin also provides an eyewitness account of an attack on the derelict Mahavihara by the Muslim soldiers stationed at nearby Odantapura (now Bihar Sharif) which had been turned into a military headquarters. Only the Tibetan and his nonagenarian instructor stayed behind and hid themselves while the rest of the monks fled. Another Tibetan source is that of Lama Taranatha, but this is from the late 16th century, and it is unclear what its sources were. The Taranatha account about Buddhism in India repeats the legendary accounts of Nalanda from the Buddha and Ashoka periods found in Xuanzang and other sources, then shifts to centuries of the 2nd-millennium. It describes Islamic raids in 12th-century India, states that whole of Magadha fell to the Turushka (Turks, a common term for Muslims in historic Indic and Tibetan texts). Their armies, asserts Taranatha, destroyed Odantapuri as well as Vikramashila. Given the hundreds of years of gap between the events and Taranatha&#x27;s account, and no clear chain of sources within the Tibetan tradition of record keeping, its reliability is questionable.

The Buddhist monk, Dhyānabhadra who was born in 1289 A.D., is recorded as attending Nalanda from the age of eight indicating the continued operation of the university into the late thirteenth century.

===Legendary accounts===
Tibetan texts such as the 18th-century work named &quot;Pag sam jon zang&quot; and 16th/17th-century Taranatha&#x27;s account include fictional Tibetan legends. These include stories such as a king Cingalaraja had brought &quot;all Hindus and Turuskas [Muslims]&quot; up to Delhi under his control, and converted from Hinduism to Buddhism under the influence of his queen, and him restoring the monasteries. 

Others state that a southern king built thousands of monasteries and temples again, Muslim robbers murdered this king, thereafter Nalanda was repaired by Mudita Bhadra and a minister named Kukutasiddha erected a temple there.

However, there is no evidence for the existence of such a king (or sultan), minister, Muslim robbers, thousands of Buddhist monuments built in India between the 13th and 19th century, or of any significant Nalanda repairs in or after the 13th century.

===Continued influence===
Johan Elverskog – a scholar of religious studies and history, states that it is incorrect to say Nalanda&#x27;s end was sudden and complete by about 1202, because it continued to have some students well into the 13th century. Elverskog, relying on Arthur Waley&#x27;s 1932 paper, states that this is confirmed by the fact a monk ordained in 13th-century Nalanda travelled to the court of Khubilai Khan. He adds that it is wrong to say that Buddhism ended in India around the 13th or 14th century or earlier, because &quot;[Buddha] Dharma survived in India at least until the 17th-century&quot;.

==== Aftermath of its destruction and influence on Tibetan Buddhist Tradition ====
After the Islamic conquest, the destruction and the demise of Nalanda, other monasteries and Buddhist culture from the plains of Bihar and Bengal, the brand memory of &quot;Nalanda&quot; remained the most revered in Tibet. The last throne-holder of Nalanda, Shakyashri Bhadra of Kashmir, fled to Tibet in 1204 at the invitation of the Tibetan translator &quot;Tropu Lotsawa&quot; (&quot;Khro-phu Lo-tsa-ba Byams-pa dpal&quot;). Some of the surviving Nalanda books were taken by fleeing monks to Tibet. He took with him several Indian masters: Sugataśrī, (an expert in Madhyamaka and Prajñāpāramitā); Jayadatta (Vinaya); Vibhūticandra (grammar and Abhidharma), Dānaśīla (logic), Saṅghaśrī (Candavyākaraṇa), Jīvagupta (books of Maitreya), Mahābodhi,(Bodhicaryāvatāra); and Kālacandra (Kālacakra).

In 1351, Tibetans committed to recreating a monastery in the heart of Tibet, staffing it with monk-scholars from diverse Buddhist schools, and name it the &quot;Nalanda monastery&quot; in the honour of the ancient Nalanda, according to the &quot;Blue Annals&quot; (Tibetan: དེབ་ཐེར་སྔོན་པོ). This institution emerged north of Lhasa in 1436 through the efforts of Rongtön Mawé Sengge, then expanded in the 15th century. It is now called the Tibetan Nalanda, to distinguish it from this site.

Tibetan Buddhist tradition is regarded to be a continuation of the Nalanda tradition. The Dalai Lama states:

The Dalai Lama refers to himself as a follower of the lineage of the seventeen Nalanda masters.

An Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Sutra manuscript preserved at the Tsethang monastery has superbly painted and well preserved wooden covers and 139 leaves. According to its colophon it was donated by the mother of the great pandita Sri Asoka in the second year of the reign of King Surapala, at the very end of the 11th century.
Nalanda still continued to operate into the 14th century as the Indian monk, Dhyānabhadra was said to have been a monk at Nalanda prior to his travels in East Asia.

=== Under the East India Company and British Empire (1800–1947) ===
After its decline, Nalanda was largely forgotten until Francis Buchanan-Hamilton surveyed the site in 1811–1812 after locals in the vicinity drew his attention to some Buddhist and Hindu images and ruins in the area. He, however, did not associate the mounds of earth and debris with famed Nalanda. That link was established by Major Markham Kittoe in 1847. Alexander Cunningham and the newly formed Archaeological Survey of India conducted an official survey in 1861–1862. Systematic excavation of the ruins by the ASI did not begin until 1915 and ended in 1937. The first four excavations were led by Spooner between 1915 and 1919. The next two were led by Sastri in 1920 and 1921. The next seven seasons of archaeological excavations through 1928 were led by Page. These efforts were not merely digging, observation and cataloguing of discoveries, they included conservation, restoration and changes to the site such as drainage to prevent damage to unearthed floors. After 1928, Kuraishi led two seasons of excavations, Chandra led the next four. The last season was led by Ghosh, but the excavations were abbreviated in 1937 for financial reasons and budget cuts. Chandra and final ASI team leaders noted that the &quot;long row of monasteries extend further into the modern village of Bargaon&quot; and the &quot;extent of entire monastic establishment can only be determined by future excavations&quot;.

===Post–independence (Post-1947)===
Post independence, the second round of excavation and restoration took place between 1974 and 1982. In 1951, the Nava Nalanda Mahavihara (&quot;New Nalanda Mahavihara&quot;), a modern centre for Pali and Buddhism in the spirit of the ancient institution, was founded by the Government of Bihar near Nalanda&#x27;s ruins at the suggestion of Rajendra Prasad, India&#x27;s first president. It was deemed to be a university in 2006.

1 September 2014 saw the commencement of the first academic year of a modern Nalanda University, with 15 students, in nearby Rajgir. Nalanda University (also known as Nalanda International University) is an international and research-intensive university located in the historical city of Rajgir in Bihar, India. It was established by an Act of Parliament to emulate the famous ancient university of Nalanda, which functioned between the 5th and 13th centuries. The idea to resurrect Nalanda University was endorsed in 2007 at the East Asia Summit, represented mostly by Asian countries including China, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia and Vietnam, apart from Australia and New Zealand, and as such, the university is seen as one of the flagship projects of the Government of India. It has been designated as an &quot;Institution of National Importance&quot; by the Parliament, and began its first academic session on 1 September 2014. Initially set up with temporary facilities in Rajgir, a modern campus spanning over is expected to be finished by 2020. This campus, upon completion, will be the largest of its kind in India, and one of the largest in Asia.

==In Jainism==
* The 24th Jaina Tirthankara &quot;Mahāvīra&quot; is said to have spent &#x27;many &quot;Cāturmāsyas&quot; (rainy seasons)&#x27; at &quot;Nālandā&quot;. Canonical scriptures of the &quot;Śvetāmbara&quot; sect also mention that &quot;Nālandā&quot; was known by other names such as &quot;Nālandāpada&quot; and &quot;Nālandā Sanniveśa&quot;. The texts further highlight that it was a suburb of &quot;Rājagṛha&quot;. &quot;Mahāvīra&quot; is said to have had met &quot;Makkhali-gosāla&quot;, the leader of the &quot;Ājīvakas&quot;, for the first time at &quot;Nālandā&quot;.
* Jaina tradition records that some of &quot;Mahāvīra&#x27;s Gaṇadharas&quot; (disciples), namely &quot;Indrabhūti Gautama&quot;, &quot;Agnibhūti Gautama&quot;, and &quot;Vāyubhūti Gautama&quot; were born in &quot;Nālandā.&quot;
* &quot;Sūtrakṛtāṅga Sūtra&quot;, a canonical Jaina scripture, contains a lecture (Book 2, Lecture 7) narrating a conversation about non-violence between &quot;Indrabhūti Gautama&quot; and &quot;Lepa&quot;, a Jaina householder in &quot;Nālandā&quot;.
* &quot;Majjhima Nikāya&quot;, an ancient Buddhist text, mentions that &quot;Mahāvīra&quot; had visited &quot;Nālandā&quot; along with many of his followers.
* &quot;Vividha Tīrtha Kalpa&quot;, a 14th century text by &quot;Ācārya Jinaprabhasūri&quot;, mentions that &quot;Mahāvīra&quot; completed 14 rainy seasons at &quot;Nālandā&quot; and that &#x27;it is the source of all beauty&quot;&#x27;.&quot;
* In his travel chronicle written in 1509 CE, Jaina monk, &quot;Muni Hansasomavijaya&quot; mentions the presence of 16 Jaina temples in &quot;Nālandā. Panyās Jayavijaya&quot; states the presence of 17 Jaina temples by 1608 CE in the region. However, by 1694 CE, most of the temples were destroyed and &quot;Panyās Saubhāgyavijaya&quot; records the presence of a temple and a stūpa only.
* The ASIGoI report of 1861 mentions the presence of a Jaina temple in the premises of the ruins of &quot;Nālandā University&quot;. It was found to have had the same architecture style as seen in the &quot;Great Temple&quot; at &quot;Bodha Gayā&quot; and was dated to the 5th century CE. The temple was found to have Jaina images and sculptures dated to 1447 CE.
* &quot;The Indian Antiquary&quot; (1918) mentions that the Jaina temple found within the ruins of &quot;Nālandā&quot; is the oldest temple in the region.

* Currently, the &quot;Śvetāmbara&quot; Jaina temple at &quot;Nālandā&quot; shares a wall with the ruins of &quot;Nālandā&quot; &quot;University&quot; and has ancient Jaina images dated to as early as the 10th century CE. The principal idol of the temple is an image of &quot;Ṛṣabhanātha&quot;, the 1st Jaina Tirthankara. It features unique iconography depicting &quot;Marudevī&quot;, his mother, on top of his head. The image also features elongated hairlocks, typically seen in &quot;Śvetāmbara&quot; Jaina iconography of &quot;Ṛṣabhanātha&quot;. Other ancient images include idols of &quot;Śāntinātha&quot;, the 16th Jaina Tirthankara, &quot;Mahāvīra&quot;, the 24th Jaina Tirthankara and of &quot;Pārśvanātha,&quot; the 23rd Jaina Tirthankara. Ancient footprints of &quot;Indrabhūti Gautama&quot; and other &quot;Gaṇadharas&quot; are also present in a separate temple in the same premises.
==The Mahavihara==
While its excavated ruins today only occupy an area of around or roughly 12 hectares, Nalanda Mahavihara occupied a far greater area in medieval times. The subjects taught at Nalanda covered every field of learning, and it attracted pupils and scholars from Korea, Japan, China, Tibet, Indonesia, Persia and Turkey. 

Although Nalanda is often labelled a Buddhist university, it had many facets that were not strictly or exclusively Buddhist. Its Gupta patrons, for instance, were adherents of Hinduism, not Buddhism.

=== The university ===
At its peak the school attracted scholars and students from near and far, with some travelling from Tibet, China, Korea, and Central Asia. The highly formalised methods of Shramanic studies helped the establishment of large teaching institutions such as Taxila, Nalanda, and Vikramashila, which are often characterised as India&#x27;s early universities. Archaeological evidence also notes contact with the Shailendra dynasty of Indonesia, one of whose kings built a monastery in the complex. Nalanda flourished under the patronage of the Gupta Empire in the 5th and 6th centuries, and later under Harsha, the emperor of Kannauj. The liberal cultural traditions inherited from the Gupta age resulted in a period of growth and prosperity until the ninth century CE. The subsequent centuries were a time of gradual decline, a period during which the tantric developments of Buddhism became most pronounced in eastern India under the Pala Empire.

Much of our knowledge of Nalanda comes from the writings of pilgrim monks from Asia, such as Xuanzang and Yijing, who travelled to the Mahavihara in the 7th century CE. Vincent Smith remarked that &quot;a detailed history of Nalanda would be a history of Mahayanist Buddhism.&quot; Many of the names listed by Xuanzang in his travelogue as alumni of Nalanda are the names of those who developed the overall philosophy of Mahayana. All students at Nalanda studied Mahayana, as well as the texts of the eighteen (Hinayana) sects of Buddhism. Their curriculum also included other subjects, such as the Vedas, logic, Sanskrit grammar, medicine, and Samkhya.

Nalanda was destroyed three times but was rebuilt only twice. It was ransacked and destroyed by an army of the Mamluk dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate under Bakhtiyar Khalji in . While some sources note that the Mahavihara continued to function in a makeshift fashion after this attack, it was eventually abandoned altogether and forgotten until the 19th century, when the site was surveyed and preliminary excavations were conducted by the Archaeological Survey of India. Systematic excavations commenced in 1915, which unearthed eleven monasteries and six brick temples neatly arranged on grounds in area. A trove of sculptures, coins, seals, and inscriptions have also been discovered in the ruins, many of which are on display in the Nalanda Archaeological Museum, situated nearby. Nalanda is now a notable tourist destination, and a part of the Buddhist tourism circuit.

On 25 November 2010, the Indian government, through an Act of Parliament, &#x27;resurrected&#x27; the ancient university through the Nalanda University Bill, with which they chose to create a new Nalanda University relatively nearby. It has been designated as an &quot;International University of National Importance,&quot; and has accordingly been subject to intense government oversight, with both of its past chancellors explicitly citing Government actions for them leaving their post and courses being shut down due to members of the ruling party disapproving of them.

===The library===

It is evident from the large numbers of texts that Yijing carried back with him after his 10-year residence at Nalanda, that the Mahavihara must have featured a well-equipped library. Traditional Tibetan sources mention the existence of a great library at Nalanda named &quot;Dharmaganja&quot; (&quot;Piety Mart&quot;) which comprised three large multi-storeyed buildings, the &quot;Ratnasagara&quot; (&quot;Ocean of Jewels&quot;), the &quot;Ratnodadhi&quot; (&quot;Sea of Jewels&quot;), and the &quot;Ratnaranjaka&quot; (&quot;Jewel-adorned&quot;). Ratnodadhi was nine storeys high and housed the most sacred manuscripts including the &quot;Prajnyaparamita Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Guhyasamaja&quot;.

The exact number of volumes in the Nalanda library is not known, but it is estimated to have been in the hundreds of thousands. When a Buddhist scholar at Nalanda died, his manuscripts were added to the library collection. The library not only collected religious manuscripts but also had texts on such subjects as grammar, logic, literature, astrology, astronomy, and medicine. The Nalanda library must have had a classification scheme which was possibly based on a text classification scheme developed by the Sanskrit linguist, Panini. Buddhist texts were most likely divided into three classes based on the Tripitaka&#x27;s three main divisions: the Vinaya, Sutra, and the Abhidhamma.

===Curriculum===
In his biography of Xuanzang, Hwui-Li states that all the students of Nalanda studied the Great Vehicle (Mahayana) as well as the works of the eighteen Nikaya traditions of Buddhism. In addition to these, they studied other subjects such as the Vedas, &quot;Hetuvidyā&quot; (Logic), &quot;Shabdavidya&quot; (Grammar and Philology), &quot;Chikitsavidya&quot; (Medicine), the works on magic (the Atharvaveda), and Samkhya. According to Frazier, the Vedic studies included Vedic texts and ritual, but also the different theoretical disciplines associated with the limbs or the sciences of the Vedas, which included disciplines such as linguistics, law, astronomy and reasoning.

Xuanzang himself studied a number of these subjects at Nalanda under Shilabhadra and others. Besides theology and philosophy, frequent debates and discussions necessitated competence in Logic. A student at the Mahavihara had to be well-versed in the systems of Logic associated with all the different schools of thought of the time as he was expected to defend Buddhist systems against the others. Other subjects believed to have been taught at Nalanda include law, astronomy, and city-planning.

Tibetan tradition holds that there were &quot;four doxographies&quot; () which were taught at Nalanda:

# Sarvastivada Vaibhashika
# Sarvastivada Sautrantika
# Madhyamaka, the Mahayana philosophy of Nagarjuna
# Chittamatra, the Mahayana philosophy of Asanga and Vasubandhu

In the 7th century, Xuanzang recorded the number of teachers at Nalanda as being around 1510. Of these, approximately 1000 were able to explain 20 collections of sutras and shastras, 500 were able to explain 30 collections, and only 10 teachers were able to explain 50 collections. Xuanzang was among the few who were able to explain 50 collections or more. At this time, only the abbot Shilabhadra had studied all the major collections of sutras and shastras at Nalanda.

===Administration===
The Chinese monk Yijing wrote that matters of discussion and administration at Nalanda would require assembly and consensus on decisions by all those at the assembly, as well as resident monks:

Xuanzang also noted:

=== Influence on Buddhism ===

A vast amount of what came to comprise Tibetan Buddhism, both its Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions, stems from the teachers and traditions at Nalanda. Shantarakshita, who pioneered the propagation of Buddhism in Tibet in the 8th century was a scholar of Nalanda. He was invited by the Tibetan king, Khri-sron-deu-tsan, and established the monastery at Samye, serving as its first abbot. He and his disciple Kamalashila (who was also of Nalanda) essentially taught Tibetans how to do philosophy. Padmasambhava, who was also invited from Nalanda Mahavihara by the king in 747 CE, is credited as a founder of Tibetan Buddhism.

The scholar Dharmakirti (), one of the Buddhist founders of Indian philosophical logic, as well as one of the primary theorists of Buddhist atomism, taught at Nalanda.

Other forms of Buddhism, such as the Mahayana Buddhism followed in Vietnam, China, Korea and Japan, flourished within the walls of the ancient school. A number of scholars have associated some Mahayana texts such as the &quot;Shurangama Sutra&quot;, an important sutra in East Asian Buddhism, with the Buddhist tradition at Nalanda. Ron Epstein also notes that the general doctrinal position of the sutra does indeed correspond to what is known about the Buddhist teachings at Nalanda toward the end of the Gupta period when it was translated.

Several Buddhist institutions overseas have chosen to call themselves Nalanda to acknowledge Nalanda&#x27;s influence. These include Nalanda Buddhist Society in Malaysia and Nalanda College, Colombo, Sri Lanka, Nalanda Buddhist Education Foundation, Indonesia, Nalanda Buddhist Institute, Bhutan

=== World Heritage Sites Recognition ===
The Nalanda Mahavihara is recognised as a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO in 2016.

== Notable scholars ==

==Excavated remains==
After its decline, Nalanda was largely forgotten until Francis Buchanan-Hamilton surveyed the site in 1811–1812 after locals in the vicinity drew his attention to a vast complex of ruins in the area. He, however, did not associate the mounds of earth and debris with famed Nalanda. That link was established by Major Markham Kittoe in 1847. Alexander Cunningham and the newly formed Archaeological Survey of India conducted an official survey in 1861–1862. Systematic excavation of the ruins by the ASI did not begin until 1915 and ended in 1937. The second round of excavation and restoration took place between 1974 and 1982.

The remains of Nalanda today extend some north to south and around east to west. Excavations have revealed eleven monasteries (also known as vihara) and six major brick temples arranged in an ordered layout. A wide passage runs from north to south with the temples to its west and the monasteries to its east. Most structures show evidence of multiple periods of construction with new buildings being raised atop the ruins of old ones. Many of the buildings also display signs of damage by fire on at least one occasion.

The map gives the layout of the excavated structures. Temple 3 in the south was the most imposing structure. Temple 12, 13, 14 face the monasteries and face east. With the exception of those designated 1A and 1B, the monasteries all face west with drains emptying out in the east and staircases positioned in the south-west corner of the buildings. Temple 2 was to the east.

All the monasteries at Nalanda are very similar in layout and general appearance. Their plan involves a rectangular form with a central quadrangular court which is surrounded by a verandah which, in turn, is bounded by an outer row of cells for the monks – a typical design of vihara architecture. The central cell facing the entrance leading into the court is a shrine chamber. Its strategic position means that it would have been the first thing that drew the eye when entering the edifice. With the exception of those designated 1A and 1B, the monasteries all face west with drains emptying out in the east and staircases positioned in the south-west corner of the buildings.

Monastery 1 is considered the oldest and the most important of the monastery group and shows as many as nine levels of construction. Its lower monastery is believed to be the one sponsored by Balaputradeva, the Srivijayan king, during the reign of Devapala in the 9th century (see Nalanda copper-plate of Devapala). The building was originally at least 2 storeys high and contained a colossal statue of a seated Buddha.
Temple no. 3 (also termed Sariputta Stupa) is the most iconic of Nalanda&#x27;s structures with its multiple flights of stairs that lead all the way to the top. The temple was originally a small structure which was built upon and enlarged by later constructions. Archaeological evidence shows that the final structure was a result of at least seven successive such accumulations of construction. The fifth of these layered temples is the most interesting and the best preserved with four corner towers of which three have been exposed. The towers as well as the sides of the stairs are decorated with exquisite panels of Gupta-era art depicting a variety of stucco figures including Buddha and the Bodhisattvas, scenes from the Jataka tales. The temple is surrounded by numerous votive stupas some of which have been built with bricks inscribed with passages from sacred Buddhist texts. The apex of Temple no. 3 features a shrine chamber which now only contains the pedestal upon which an immense statue of Buddha must have once rested. According to Win Maung, the stupa was influenced by Gupta architecture, which itself had Kushana era influences. In a shrine near the bottom of the staircase, a large image of Avalotiteshvar was found which was eventually moved to the museum.
Temple no. 2 notably features 211 sculptured religious and secular panels. These include Shiva, Parvati, Kartikeya, and Gajalakshmi, Kinnaras playing musical instruments, various representations of Makaras, as well as human couples in amorous postures, as well as scenes of art and of everyday life. Susan Huntington and Bhaskara Misra – scholars of Indian architecture and arts, state Temple 2 as a Hindu temple. However, Huu Phuoc Le – a scholar of Buddhist architecture, questions this purely &quot;Hindu affiliation&quot;, stating that it could be a temple based on the mandala principles, and one reflecting &quot;Hindu-Buddhist syncretism&quot; of the 8th to 12th century when Shaiva and Shakti deities were integrated into Vajrayana Buddhism. The site of Temple no. 13 features a brick-made smelting furnace with four chambers. The discovery of burnt metal and slag suggests that it was used to cast metallic objects. Birendra Nath Mishra also observed that the panels containing Hindu deities were attached to the structure with iron clamps indicating that they were probably added at a later date. In addition, only ten per cent of the panels contain Hindu deities. Temple no. 2 is also located outside of the monastic enclosure although it is close to it hence it can be inferred that the inclusion of Hindu deities at this site was a &quot;Buddhist attempt at subordinate integration of Brahmanism to Buddhism without employing any confrontationist imagery&quot;.

To the north of Temple 13 lie the remains of Temple no. 14. An enormous image of the Buddha was discovered here. The image&#x27;s pedestal features fragments of the only surviving exhibit of mural painting at Nalanda.

To the east of Temple 2, lie the remains of Sarai Temple in the recently excavated Sarai Mound. This multi-storeyed Buddhist temple with many stupas and shrines was enclosed by a massive wall enclosure. The remains in the sanctum suggest that the Buddha statue was around high.

Numerous sculptures, as well as many murals, copper plates, artworks, inscriptions, seals, coins, plaques, potteries and works in stone, bronze, stucco, and terracotta, have been unearthed within the ruins of Nalanda. The Buddhist sculptures discovered notably include those of the Buddha in different postures, Avalokiteshvara, Jambhala, Manjushri, Marichi, and Tara. Hindu sculptures of Vishnu, Shiva-Parvathi, Ganesha, Mahishasura Mardini, and Surya have also been found in the ruins.

A Black Buddha temple (termed by locals as the Telia Bhairav, &quot;tel&quot; refers to use of oil) is near Temple 14 with has an ancient large black Buddha image in bhumisparha mudra. This the same temple termed Baithak Bhairab in Cunningham&#x27;s 1861–62 ASI report.

==Surviving Nalanda manuscripts==
Fleeing monks took some of the Nalanda manuscripts. A few of them have survived and are preserved in collections such as those at:

* Los Angeles County Museum of Art Folios from a Dharanisamgraha, circa 1075.
* Asia Society This Ashtasahasrika Prajnaparamita manuscript records, in Sanskrit and Tibetan, the history of the manuscript from its creation at the famous Nalanda monastery in India through its use in Tibet by the compiler of the first Tibetan canon of Buddhism, Buton.
* Yarlung Museum, Tsetang (From the &quot;On ke ru Lha khang monastery&quot;) Astasahahasrika Prajnaparamita Sanskrit palm-leaf manuscript, with 139 leaves and painted wooden covers. According to the colophon, this manuscript was donated by the mother of the great pandita Sri Asoka in the second year of the reign of King Surapala at end of the 11th century.

==Nalanda inscriptions==
A number of inscriptions were found during the excavation, which are now preserved in the Nalanda Museum. These include:
* Son of a minister of Yashovarman donated to the temple built by king Baladitya. 8th cent CE, basalt slab found in monastery 1.
* Murnavarman constructed a brass image of Buddha. 7th cent CE, basalt slab, found in Sarai mound. 
* Monk Vipulshrimitra built a monastery. Basalt slab, later half of 12th cent, found in the uppermost level of Monastery 7. 
* Donation of Balaputradeva, the king of Suvarnadvipa of Sailendra dynasty. 860 CE Copperplate found by Hirananda Shastri in 1921 in the antechamber of Monastery 1 at Nalanda.

==Tourism==

Nalanda is a popular tourist destination in the state attracting a number of Indian and overseas visitors. It is also an important stop on the Buddhist tourism circuit.

===Nalanda Archaeological Museum===

The Archaeological Survey of India maintains a museum near the ruins for the benefit of visitors. The museum, opened in 1917, exhibits the antiquities that have been unearthed at Nalanda as well as from nearby Rajgir. Out of 13,463 items, only 349 are on display in four galleries.

===Xuanzang Memorial Hall===

The Xuanzang Memorial Hall is an Indo-Chinese undertaking to honour the famed Buddhist monk and traveller. A relic, comprising a skull bone of the Chinese monk, is on display in the memorial hall.

===Nalanda Multimedia Museum===
Another museum adjoining the excavated site is the privately run Nalanda Multimedia Museum. It showcases the history of Nalanda through 3-D animation and other multimedia presentations.

<doc id="200289" wikidata="Q5457710" url="?curid=200289" title="Flat-twelve engine">
<text>A flat-twelve engine, also known as a horizontally opposed-twelve, is a twelve-cylinder piston engine with six cylinders on each side of a central crankshaft.

Flat-twelve engines are less common than V12 engines, but they have been used in various racing cars during the 1960s and 1970s, and in mid-engined Ferrari road cars from 1973 to 1996.

== Design ==
Unlike most flat-twin, flat-four, and flat-six engines, flat-twelve engines typically use the crankshaft configuration of a 180° V engine. Instead of the boxer engine design of each piston having its own crankpin, flat-twelve engines have each pair of pistons sharing a crankpin, and thus are flat, but not true boxers.

Compared with a V12 engine, a flat-twelve has a lower center of gravity, but because a flat-twelve is wider they are rarely used in front-engined cars.

==Racing cars==
=== Formula One ===
The first known flat-twelve engine was built by Porsche in 1947 for the abandoned Cisitalia Grand Prix racing car. The engine, known as the Porsche Typ 360, was supercharged and had a displacement of . One engine was built and the car conducted top speed testing, but it never competed in any races.

In 1964–65, the Ferrari 512 F1 competed in several Formula One races. The 512 F1 was powered by a flat-twelve engine and raced alongside the V8-engined Ferrari 158 upon which it was based. Ferrari returned to using flat-twelve engines in 1970, when the Ferrari 312B switched from the V12 engine used by its predecessor. Its successor, the Ferrari 312T, was introduced in 1975 and won the Formula One constructors championships from 1975 to 1979. The success of the Ferrari 312T led other Formula One teams to build flat-twelve engines, such as the 1979 Alfa Romeo 177.

In 1990, the Subaru 1235 flat-twelve engine was built for Subaru&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to compete in Formula One as an engine manufacturer.

=== Sports car racing ===

In 1969, the Porsche 917 sports prototype racing car introduced an air-cooled flat-twelve engine. This flat-twelve engine was based on the previous flat-eight engine, but it used a V12 crankshaft configuration instead of the boxer configuration used by the flat-eight. The domination of the Porsche 917 probably influenced Ferrari, because they switched from V12 engines to flat-twelve engines (using a boxer configuration) for the Ferrari 312 PB, which competed from 1971 to 1973. Alfa Romeo also used flat-twelve engines in the 1973-1976 Alfa Romeo 33TT12 and Alfa Romeo 33SC12 sports prototype racing cars.

For the 1991 sports-prototype racing category, Mercedes-Benz switched from a twin-turbo V8 engine to a naturally-aspirated flat-twelve engine for in the Mercedes-Benz C291 racing car. This engine employed a cylinder-head design with exhaust ports where the intake ports would normally be (on top of the engine, pointing upwards). The intake ports are between the intake and exhaust camshafts, just above the spark-plugs, pointing at an outward angle from the vertical. This was done to allow the engine to be installed lower in the chassis. The C291 was unsuccessful and Mercedes withdrew from sports-prototype racing after the 1991 season.

== Production cars ==
From 1973 to 1996, Ferrari used flat-twelve engines in various production models: the 1973-1976 Ferrari 365 GT/4 BB, the 1976-1981 Ferrari 512 BB, the 1981-1984 Ferrari 512 BBi, the 1984-1991 Ferrari Testarossa, the 1991-1994 Ferrari 512 TR and the 1994-1996 Ferrari F512 M.

== Other uses ==
During World War II, the British Covenanter tank was powered by a Meadows D.A.V flat-12, 340 hp (250 kW) and the Churchill by a 350 hp (261 kW) Bedford engine flat 12. Another military vehicle usage was the Panhard EBR armored cars during the 1950s.

During the 1940s, the Franklin Engine Company in the United States produced a flat-twelve aircraft engine called the O-805-2.

<text>The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (), commonly known by its initialism NRK, is a Norwegian state-run, government-influenced radio and television public broadcasting company.

The NRK broadcasts three national TV channels and thirteen national radio channels on digital terrestrial television, digital terrestrial radio and subscription television. They also offer an online video on-demand and podcast streaming service, and produce online and broadcast news.

The NRK is a founding member of the European Broadcasting Union and a member of the Norwegian Press Association.

==Financing==
Until the start of 2020, about 94% of NRK&#x27;s funding came from a mandatory annual licence fee payable by anyone who owns or uses a TV or device capable of receiving TV broadcasts. The remainder came from commercial activities such as programme and DVD sales, spin-off products, and certain types of sponsorships. NRK&#x27;s license income in 2012 was more than 5 billion NOK. In the autumn of 2015, the government announced that it planned to change the way NRK is financed. This was in part a reaction to the decline of TV ownership in Norway. From the start of 2020, NRK funding is an item in the national budget and the costs are covered through taxation for each individual liable for income taxes in Norway.

==History==

, a privately owned company and the predecessor of NRK, started regular radio broadcasts in Norway in 1925. NRK itself was founded in 1933. Based on a model similar to that of the BBC and located in Oslo, it was a replacement for privately operated radio stations in larger cities. NRK initially set out to cover the entire country and had a monopoly on broadcasting in Norway. The monopoly came under intense pressure when Norwegian TV companies began broadcasting from abroad in addition to international cable TV. Cable TV started in 1982 and satellite TV in 1986 (the launch of TV3 in 1987 and TVNorge in 1988). It was not until the launch of TV 2 on 5 September 1992, that NRK&#x27;s monopoly on television broadcasting in Norway ended.

During the Nazi German occupation, Norwegian transmitters were used to broadcast Nazi German war propaganda to Northern Europe (particularly Scotland and the northern half of Ireland, where the sea path ensured a good signal) and Scandinavia.

Prior to the Nazi German occupation, NRK had also been partly financed by radio commercials.

NRK was one of 23 founding broadcasting organisations of the European Broadcasting Union, which was founded in 1950. In 1954, NRK started broadcasting television shows, on a trial basis. Regular broadcasts started in 1960.

In 1969, NRK adopted a new version of its corporate logo which consists of the lowercased &quot;nrk&quot; wordmark that has the letter &quot;n&quot; being made up of a rectangle and a reversed-italic rectangle, the letter &quot;r&quot; being made up of a rectangle and a circle, and the letter &quot;k&quot; being made up of a rectangle and reflecting-mirrored italic rectangles.

NRK was the last of the major European public broadcasters to introduce a second radio station, officially starting as late as 1984. In 1993, NRK launched a third radio station, the youth-oriented &quot;P3&quot;. A 24-hour station for classical music, (now called &quot;NRK Klassisk&quot;), introduced in 1995, was the first of its kind to be broadcast digitally using digital audio broadcasting. The 24-hour news station &quot;Alltid Nyheter&quot; started in 1997, followed by a radio station for teenagers, &quot;mP3&quot; in 2000, which mostly plays pop music.

On 1 September 1996, a second television channel called NRK2 was launched. The original television channel is now known as NRK1. On 3 September 2007, NRK launched its third channel: a youth channel called NRK3. Later that year, on 1 December, NRK launched its fourth television channel, NRK Super, which is aimed at children. NRK3 and NRK Super share the same channel, with NRK Super broadcasting from 06:00 to 19:30 and NRK3 from 19:30 to 06:00.

In 2000, following NRK Interaktiv&#x27;s relaunch as NRK.no, NRK redesigned its corporate logo (that was introduced in 1969), so that it could be similar to its old version. This new version of NRK&#x27;s corporate logo made its first appearance in an ident in 2001 by making its overhaul to NRK&#x27;s radio and television channels.

A traditional music radio station, &quot;NRK&quot; (now known as &quot;NRK Folkemusikk&quot;) was launched in 2004 on DAB and internet radio.
NRK&#x27;s international radio transmissions, known as , began shortwave transmission in 1948. Initially broadcasting in Norwegian, English-language programs were added later. The service was discontinued on 1 January 2002. All NRK broadcasting activities on shortwave ceased on 1 January 2004. NRK&#x27;s mediumwave transmitter at Kvitsøy on 1314 kHz used to be widely heard internationally and was one of the most commonly heard trans-Atlantic DX signals in eastern North America. The frequency carried a mixture of NRK&#x27;s radio channels P1 and P2, and was called (literally &quot;The Europe Channel&quot;). However, these mediumwave transmissions were discontinued on 1 July 2006.

All of NRK&#x27;s radio stations are now available on the internet. Several of NRK&#x27;s television programmes are also available on the internet.

On 16 April 2015, the Norwegian Ministry of Culture announced its intention to eventually switch off all FM transmitters in the country, with the first such transmitter expected to be switched off on 11 January 2017, therefore making Norway the first country in the world to completely transition to digital radio. According to the Ministry of Culture, the decision was justified because transmitting through the FM network was eight times more expensive than transmitting through digital audio broadcasting, and because only five national radio stations are transmitting on FM, compared to the 42 digital radio stations allocated in Norway, with 22 stations transmitting on the latter. NRK Radio is expected to transition from FM to digital radio before commercial radio stations do so.

NRK claimed to have the longest-running radio show, &quot;Lørdagsbarnetimen&quot; (&quot;The Saturday Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;), which ran from 20 December 1924 until 11 September 2010.

===Redevelopment of Marienlyst and relocation of its headquarters===

In 2017, NRK asked five architectural firms to present sketches for possible development and use of NRK&#x27;s area at Marienlyst, should NRK move rather than improve the property. In 2019, work began to find the best site for a new building, and in 2020 the property on Marienlyst was sold to Ferd Eiendom for NOK 3.75 billion.

Close to 100 different locations were considered for the new head office, but Gamle Oslo, Bryn, Storo Løren, Lillestrøm-Puls and Lilleaker were the most relevant options. Director of relocation Jon Espen Lohne in NRK, said in 2020 that they have ambitions to get the country to choose a site before the end of the year. In May 2021, it was announced that NRK had decided to move to Ensjø, and that the price for the property was NOK 800 million.

===FM radio switch-off===

Norway was the first country to announce a complete switch-off of national FM radio stations, including NRK P1 with regional services, NRK P2 and NRK P3, NRK mP3 and NRK Alltid Nyheter. Switch off started on 11 January 2017, and ended on 13 December 2017.

From 2018, all FM transmitters are replaced with broadcast via DAB +, internet and cable.

==Organisation==

The CEO began major organisational changes in 2008, with the aim of creating a more agile NRK, while still adhering to the principles of the broadcaster-producer model introduced in January 2001. By January 2009, the number of programme-producing divisions had been reduced from five to three, separated more along geographical than functional lines, and at the same time simplifying trading in the internal market. The programme-producing divisions are: 
* &quot;Marienlyst&quot; covering all facilities in Oslo
* &quot;Distrikt&quot;, encompassing all regional offices and with their headquarters in Trondheim
* &quot;Sami&quot;, the producer of Sámi programmes situated in Karasjok

Vibeke Fürst Haugen has been director-general of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation since 29 April 2022. The previous directors were Olav Midttun (1934–1947, except during the Nazi occupation), Kaare Fostervoll (1948–1962), Hans Jacob Ustvedt (1962–1971), Torolf Elster (1972–1981), Bjartmar Gjerde (1981–1988), Einar Førde (1989–2001), John G. Bernander (2001–2007), Hans-Tore Bjerkaas (2007–2012) and Thor Gjermund Eriksen (2012-2022). After WW2, all but Hans-Tore Bjerkaas and John G. Bernander had been active politically in socialist parties. The current director-general, Vibeke Fürst Haugen, came from the position of director of the Marienlyst-division of NRK in Oslo.

The chairman of the board is Birger Magnus, Marius Lillelien heads the broadcasting department, and the head of the news department is Marius Tetlie. In 2017, NRK employed 3419 and 266 temporary staff.

Yle Mondo, which broadcasts on FM in the greater Helsinki area, carries half an hour of unspecified NRK radio shows in Norwegian on weekdays at 13:30 as of November 2023.

==Criticism and controversies==
===2019 NRK Facebook controversy ===
In July 2019, a cartoon produced and posted on NRK’s Facebook page was widely panned for antisemitism. It featured an orthodox Jew participating in a game of Scrabble, where his opponent is hesitant to lay down his point-scoring yet deeply offensive word &quot;Jew swine&quot;. The network received over 300 complaint letters. NRK denied accusations of antisemitism, but removed the description &quot;tag a Jew&quot; from the video. The network previously apologized for spoofing the Holocaust in a 2016 cartoon, which has still not been removed.

<text>Simon Cornelis Dik (September 6, 1940 in Delden – March 1, 1995 in Holysloot) was a Dutch linguist, most famous for developing the theory of functional grammar. He occupied the chair of General Linguistics at University of Amsterdam between 1969 and 1994. During these 25 years he developed the theory of functional grammar, the foundations for which had been laid in his 1968 dissertation on coordination.

Two years before his death, Dik fell ill. As much as his illness allowed, he worked on developing his theory until his death. The second part of his work, &quot;The Theory of Functional Grammar&quot;, was published posthumously in 1997.

==Career==
Simon Dik took a degree in classical language. His PhD dissertation was done under the supervision of Anton Reichling, and after it he became chair of general linguistics in Amsterdam at only 28 years old, which was a point of discussion. During the 70s and 80s he worked on formulating his theory of functional grammar, including various discussions with proponents of generative grammar which formed a big part of linguistics departments in the Netherlands. He was the supervisor of Kees Hengeveld who then became his closest collaborator, and helped part II of &quot;The theory of functional grammar&quot; materialize as Dik fell ill in 1992.

==Selected publications==
* &quot;The Theory of Functional Grammar (Part I: The Structure of the clause)&quot;, 1989 
* &quot;The Theory of Functional Grammar (Part II: Complex and Derived Constructions)&quot;, 1997 (pt. I); (pt. I paperback); (pt. II); (pt. II paperback)

<text>Pierre Marie Augustin Filon (1841–1916) was a French professor of rhetoric and the author of a number of works of fiction, as well many articles, reviews and books on contemporary English politics, art and literature.

The son of the historian Charles Auguste Désiré Filon and Marie Théodorine Sandrie-des-Fosses whom he had married on 25 August 1828, Augustin was born in Paris. Educated at the &quot;École normale&quot;, he lectured for some years in the &quot;Lycées&quot; of Nice and Grenoble. In October 1867, Duruy, then the French minister of education, appointed him tutor to the Prince Imperial. During the Empress&#x27;s Regency in 1870, M. Filon acted as her private secretary. Upon the fall of the Second French Empire, the Prince Imperial was exiled to Chislehurst, Kent, accompanied by Filon, who settled in England with his family. He also wrote on English subjects, chiefly under the pseudonym of Pierre Sandrié.

He also wrote the prefaces for certain works by his younger sister, historian and writer Mary Summer.

His only child was the distinguished applied mathematician Louis Napoleon George Filon, who worked with Karl Pearson.

<doc id="200303" wikidata="Q2627019" url="?curid=200303" title="Frédéric Alfred Pierre, comte de Falloux">
<text>Frédéric-Alfred-Pierre, comte de Falloux (7 May 1811 – 6 January 1886) was a French politician and author, famous for having given his name to two laws on education, favoring private Catholic teaching.

==Biography==
Falloux was born at Angers, Maine-et-Loire. His father had been ennobled by King Charles X of France, and Falloux began his career as a Legitimist and clerical journalist under the influence of Madame Swetchine. In 1846 he entered the legislature as deputy for the Maine-et-Loire, and with many other Catholics he gave real or pretended support to the revolution of 1848. Louis Napoleon made him minister of public instruction and worship in December 1848, but having fallen sick in September 1849, he was replaced in October.

He had nevertheless secured the passage of the &quot;Loi Falloux&quot; (15 March 1850) for the organization of primary and secondary education. This law provided that the clergy and members of ecclesiastical orders, male and female, might exercise the profession of teaching without producing any further qualification. This exemption was extended even to priests who taught in secondary schools, where a university degree was exacted from lay teachers. The primary schools were put under the management of the curés. Falloux was elected to the Académie française in 1856.

His failure to secure re-election to the legislature in 1866, 1869, 1870 and 1871 was due to the opposition of the stricter Legitimists, who viewed with suspicion his attempts to reconcile the Orléans princes with Henri, comte de Chambord. In spite of his failure to enter the National Assembly his influence was great, and was increased by his personal friendship with Adolphe Thiers. Nevertheless, in 1872 he offended both sections of the monarchical party at a conference arranged in the hope of effecting a fusion between the partisans of the comte de Chambord and of the Orléans princes, divided on the vexed question of the flag. He suggested that the comte de Chambord might recede from his position with dignity at the desire of the National Assembly, and not content with this encroachment on royalist principles, he insinuated the possibility of a transitional stage with the duc d&#x27;Aumale as president of the republic. His disgrace was so complete that he was excommunicated by the Bishop of Angers in 1876.

Of his numerous works the best known are his &quot;Histoire de Louis XVI&quot; (1840); &quot;Histoire de Saint Pie V&quot; (1845); &quot;De la contre-révolution&quot; (1876); and the posthumous &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;un royaliste&quot; (2 volumes, 1888).

<text>In calculus, Rolle&#x27;s theorem or Rolle&#x27;s lemma essentially states that any real-valued differentiable function that attains equal values at two distinct points must have at least one point, somewhere between them, at which the slope of the tangent line is zero. Such a point is known as a stationary point. It is a point at which the first derivative of the function is zero. The theorem is named after Michel Rolle.

== Standard version of the theorem ==

If a real-valued function is continuous on a proper closed interval , differentiable on the open interval , and , then there exists at least one in the open interval such that formula_1

This version of Rolle&#x27;s theorem is used to prove the mean value theorem, of which Rolle&#x27;s theorem is indeed a special case. It is also the basis for the proof of Taylor&#x27;s theorem.

== History ==
Although the theorem is named after Michel Rolle, Rolle&#x27;s 1691 proof covered only the case of polynomial functions. His proof did not use the methods of differential calculus, which at that point in his life he considered to be fallacious. The theorem was first proved by Cauchy in 1823 as a corollary of a proof of the mean value theorem. The name &quot;Rolle&#x27;s theorem&quot; was first used by Moritz Wilhelm Drobisch of Germany in 1834 and by Giusto Bellavitis of Italy in 1846.

== Examples ==

===Half circle===

For a radius , consider the function
formula_2

Its graph is the upper semicircle centered at the origin. This function is continuous on the closed interval and differentiable in the open interval , but not differentiable at the endpoints and . Since , Rolle&#x27;s theorem applies, and indeed, there is a point where the derivative of is zero. The theorem applies even when the function cannot be differentiated at the endpoints because it only requires the function to be differentiable in the open interval.

===Absolute value===

If differentiability fails at an interior point of the interval, the conclusion of Rolle&#x27;s theorem may not hold. Consider the absolute value function
formula_3

Then , but there is no between −1 and 1 for which the is zero. This is because that function, although continuous, is not differentiable at . The derivative of changes its sign at , but without attaining the value 0. The theorem cannot be applied to this function because it does not satisfy the condition that the function must be differentiable for every in the open interval. However, when the differentiability requirement is dropped from Rolle&#x27;s theorem, will still have a critical number in the open interval , but it may not yield a horizontal tangent (as in the case of the absolute value represented in the graph).

===Functions with zero derivative===

Rolle&#x27;s theorem implies that a differentiable function whose derivative is in an interval is constant in this interval. 

Indeed, if and are two points in an interval where a function is differentiable, then the function
formula_4
satisfies the hypotheses of Rolle&#x27;s theorem on the interval .

If the derivative of is zero everywhere, the derivative of is
formula_5
and Rolle&#x27;s theorem implies that there is such that
formula_6

Hence, for every and , and the function is constant.

== Generalization ==

The second example illustrates the following generalization of Rolle&#x27;s theorem:

Consider a real-valued, continuous function on a closed interval with . If for every in the open interval the right-hand limit
formula_7
and the left-hand limit
formula_8

exist in the extended real line , then there is some number in the open interval such that one of the two limits
formula_9
is and the other one is (in the extended real line). If the right- and left-hand limits agree for every , then they agree in particular for , hence the derivative of exists at and is equal to zero.

===Remarks===
* If is convex or concave, then the right- and left-hand derivatives exist at every inner point, hence the above limits exist and are real numbers.
* This generalized version of the theorem is sufficient to prove convexity when the one-sided derivatives are monotonically increasing: formula_10

== Proof of the generalized version ==

Since the proof for the standard version of Rolle&#x27;s theorem and the generalization are very similar, we prove the generalization.

The idea of the proof is to argue that if , then must attain either a maximum or a minimum somewhere between and , say at , and the function must change from increasing to decreasing (or the other way around) at . In particular, if the derivative exists, it must be zero at .

By assumption, is continuous on , and by the extreme value theorem attains both its maximum and its minimum in . If these are both attained at the endpoints of , then is constant on and so the derivative of is zero at every point in .

Suppose then that the maximum is obtained at an interior point of (the argument for the minimum is very similar, just consider ). We shall examine the above right- and left-hand limits separately.

For a real such that is in , the value is smaller or equal to because attains its maximum at . Therefore, for every ,
formula_11
hence
formula_12
where the limit exists by assumption, it may be minus infinity.

Similarly, for every , the inequality turns around because the denominator is now negative and we get
formula_13
hence
formula_14
where the limit might be plus infinity.

Finally, when the above right- and left-hand limits agree (in particular when is differentiable), then the derivative of at must be zero.

(Alternatively, we can apply Fermat&#x27;s stationary point theorem directly.)

== Generalization to higher derivatives ==

We can also generalize Rolle&#x27;s theorem by requiring that has more points with equal values and greater regularity. Specifically, suppose that
* the function is times continuously differentiable on the closed interval and the th derivative exists on the open interval , and
* there are intervals given by in such that for every from 1 to . 
Then there is a number in such that the th derivative of at is zero.
The requirements concerning the th derivative of can be weakened as in the generalization above, giving the corresponding (possibly weaker) assertions for the right- and left-hand limits defined above with in place of .

Particularly, this version of the theorem asserts that if a function differentiable enough times has roots (so they have the same value, that is 0), then there is an internal point where vanishes.

===Proof===
The proof uses mathematical induction. The case is simply the standard version of Rolle&#x27;s theorem. For , take as the induction hypothesis that the generalization is true for . We want to prove it for . Assume the function satisfies the hypotheses of the theorem. By the standard version of Rolle&#x27;s theorem, for every integer from 1 to , there exists a in the open interval such that . Hence, the first derivative satisfies the assumptions on the closed intervals . By the induction hypothesis, there is a such that the st derivative of at is zero.

== Generalizations to other fields ==
Rolle&#x27;s theorem is a property of differentiable functions over the real numbers, which are an ordered field. As such, it does not generalize to other fields, but the following corollary does: if a real polynomial factors (has all of its roots) over the real numbers, then its derivative does as well. One may call this property of a field Rolle&#x27;s property. More general fields do not always have differentiable functions, but they do always have polynomials, which can be symbolically differentiated. Similarly, more general fields may not have an order, but one has a notion of a root of a polynomial lying in a field.

Thus Rolle&#x27;s theorem shows that the real numbers have Rolle&#x27;s property. Any algebraically closed field such as the complex numbers has Rolle&#x27;s property. However, the rational numbers do not for example, factors over the rationals, but its derivative,
formula_15
does not. The question of which fields satisfy Rolle&#x27;s property was raised in . For finite fields, the answer is that only and have Rolle&#x27;s property.

<text>Michel Rolle (21 April 1652 – 8 November 1719) was a French mathematician. He is best known for Rolle&#x27;s theorem (1691). He is also the co-inventor in Europe of Gaussian elimination (1690).

==Life==
Rolle was born in Ambert, Basse-Auvergne. Rolle, the son of a shopkeeper, received only an elementary education. He married early and as a young man struggled to support his family on the meager wages of a transcriber for notaries and attorney. In spite of his financial problems and minimal education, Rolle studied algebra and Diophantine analysis (a branch of number theory) on his own. He moved from Ambert to Paris in 1675.

Rolle&#x27;s fortune changed dramatically in 1682 when he published an elegant solution of a difficult, unsolved problem in Diophantine analysis. The public recognition of his achievement led to a patronage under minister Louvois, a job as an elementary mathematics teacher, and eventually to a short-termed administrative post in the Ministry of War. In 1685 he joined the Académie des Sciences in a very low-level position for which he received no regular salary until 1699. Rolle was promoted to a salaried position in the academy, a &quot;pensionnaire géometre,&quot;. This was a distinguished post because of the 70 members of the academy, only 20 were paid. He had then already been given a pension by Jean-Baptiste Colbert after he solved one of Jacques Ozanam&#x27;s problems. He remained there until he died of apoplexy in 1719.

While Rolle&#x27;s forte was always Diophantine analysis, his most important work was a book on the algebra of equations, called &quot;Traité d&#x27;algèbre&quot;, published in 1690. In that book Rolle firmly established the notation for the &quot;n&quot;th root of a real number, and proved a polynomial version of the theorem that today bears his name. (Rolle&#x27;s theorem was named by Giusto Bellavitis in 1846.)

Rolle was one of the most vocal early antagonists of calculus – ironically so, because Rolle&#x27;s theorem is essential for basic proofs in calculus. He strove intently to demonstrate that it gave erroneous results and was based on unsound reasoning. He quarreled so vehemently on the subject that the Académie des Sciences was forced to intervene on several occasions.

Among his several achievements, Rolle helped advance the currently accepted size order for negative numbers. Descartes, for example, viewed –2 as smaller than –5. Rolle preceded most of his contemporaries by adopting the current convention in 1691.

Rolle died in Paris. No contemporary portrait of him is known.

==Work==
Rolle was an early critic of infinitesimal calculus, arguing that it was inaccurate, based upon unsound reasoning, and was a collection of ingenious fallacies, but later changed his opinion.
In 1690, Rolle published &quot;Traité d&#x27;Algebre.&quot; It contains the first &quot;published&quot; description in Europe of the Gaussian elimination algorithm, which Rolle called the method of substitution Some examples of the method had previously appeared in algebra books, and Isaac Newton had previously described the method in his lecture notes, but Newton&#x27;s lesson was not published until 1707. Rolle&#x27;s statement of the method seems not to have been noticed insofar as the lesson for Gaussian elimination that was taught in 18th- and 19th-century algebra textbooks owes more to Newton than to Rolle.

Rolle is best known for Rolle&#x27;s theorem in differential calculus. Rolle had used the result in 1690, and he proved it (by the standards of the time) in 1691. Given his animosity to infinitesimals it is fitting that the result was couched in terms of algebra rather than analysis. Only in the 18th century was the theorem interpreted as a fundamental result in differential calculus. Indeed, it is needed to prove both the mean value theorem and the existence of Taylor series. As the importance of the theorem grew, so did the interest in identifying the origin, and it was finally named &quot;Rolle&#x27;s theorem&quot; in the 19th century. Barrow-Green remarks that the theorem might well have been named for someone else had not a few copies of Rolle&#x27;s 1691 publication survived.

==Critique of infinitesimal calculus==
In a criticism of infinitesimal calculus that predated George Berkeley&#x27;s, Rolle presented a series of papers at the French academy, alleging that the use of the methods of infinitesimal calculus leads to errors. Specifically, he presented an explicit algebraic curve, and alleged that some of its local minima are missed when one applies the methods of infinitesimal calculus. Pierre Varignon responded by pointing out that Rolle had misrepresented the curve, and that the alleged local minima are in fact singular points with a vertical tangent.

<doc id="200310" wikidata="Q184373" url="?curid=200310" title="Sodium nitrate">
<text>Sodium nitrate is the chemical compound with the formula . This alkali metal nitrate salt is also known as Chile saltpeter (large deposits of which were historically mined in Chile) to distinguish it from ordinary saltpeter, potassium nitrate. The mineral form is also known as nitratine, nitratite or soda niter.

Sodium nitrate is a white deliquescent solid very soluble in water. It is a readily available source of the nitrate anion (NO3−), which is useful in several reactions carried out on industrial scales for the production of fertilizers, pyrotechnics, smoke bombs and other explosives, glass and pottery enamels, food preservatives (esp. meats), and solid rocket propellant. It has been mined extensively for these purposes.

==History==
The first shipment of saltpeter to Europe arrived in England from Peru in 1820 or 1825, right after that country&#x27;s independence from Spain, but did not find any buyers and was dumped at sea in order to avoid customs toll. With time, however, the mining of South American saltpeter became a profitable business (in 1859, England alone consumed 47,000 metric tons). Chile fought the War of the Pacific (1879–1884) against the allies Peru and Bolivia and took over their richest deposits of saltpeter. In 1919, Ralph Walter Graystone Wyckoff determined its crystal structure using X-ray crystallography.

==Occurrence==
The largest accumulations of naturally occurring sodium nitrate are found in Chile and Peru, where nitrate salts are bound within mineral deposits called caliche ore. Nitrates accumulate on land through marine-fog precipitation and sea-spray oxidation/desiccation followed by gravitational settling of airborne NaNO3, KNO3, NaCl, Na2SO4, and I, in the hot-dry desert atmosphere. El Niño/La Niña extreme aridity/torrential rain cycles favor nitrates accumulation through both aridity and water solution/remobilization/transportation onto slopes and into basins; capillary solution movement forms layers of nitrates; pure nitrate forms rare veins. For more than a century, the world supply of the compound was mined almost exclusively from the Atacama desert in northern Chile until, at the turn of the 20th century, German chemists Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch developed a process for producing ammonia from the atmosphere on an industrial scale (see Haber process). With the onset of World War I, Germany began converting ammonia from this process into a synthetic &quot;Chilean saltpeter&quot;, which was as practical as the natural compound in production of gunpowder and other munitions. By the 1940s, this conversion process resulted in a dramatic decline in demand for sodium nitrate procured from natural sources.

Chile still has the largest reserves of caliche, with active mines in such locations as Valdivia, María Elena and Pampa Blanca, and there it used to be called &quot;white gold&quot;. Sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate, sodium sulfate and iodine are all obtained by the processing of caliche. The former Chilean saltpeter mining communities of Humberstone and Santa Laura were declared UNESCO World Heritage sites in 2005.

== Synthesis ==
Sodium nitrate is also synthesized industrially by neutralizing nitric acid with sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate:

:2 HNO3 + Na2CO3 → 2 NaNO3 + H2O + CO2

:HNO3 + NaHCO3 → NaNO3 + H2O + CO2

or also by neutralizing it with sodium hydroxide (however, this reaction is very exothermic):

:HNO3 + NaOH → NaNO3 + H2O

or by mixing stoichiometric amounts of ammonium nitrate and sodium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate or sodium carbonate:

:NH4NO3 + NaOH → NaNO3 + NH4OH

:NH4NO3 + NaHCO3 → NaNO3 + NH4HCO3

:2NH4NO3 + Na2CO3 → 2NaNO3 + (NH4)2CO3

==Uses==
Most sodium nitrate is used in fertilizers, where it supplies a water-soluble form of nitrogen. Its use, which is mainly outside of high-income countries, is attractive since it does not alter the pH of the soil. Another major use is as a complement to ammonium nitrate in explosives. Molten sodium nitrate and its solutions with potassium nitrate have good thermal stability (up to 600 °C) and high heat capacities. These properties are suitable for thermally annealing metals and for storing thermal energy in solar applications.

=== Food ===
Sodium nitrate is also a food additive used as a preservative and color fixative in cured meats and poultry; it is listed under its INS number 251 or E number E251. It is approved for use in the EU, US and Australia and New Zealand. Sodium nitrate should not be confused with sodium nitrite, which is also a common food additive and preservative used, for example, in deli meats.

=== Thermal storage ===
Sodium nitrate has also been investigated as a phase-change material for thermal energy recovery, owing to its relatively high melting enthalpy of 178 J/g. Examples of the applications of sodium nitrate used for thermal energy storage include solar thermal power technologies and direct steam generating parabolic troughs.

=== Steel coating ===

Sodium nitrate is used in a steel coating process in which it forms a surface of magnetite layer.

==Health concerns==
Studies have shown a link between increased levels of nitrates and increased deaths from certain diseases including Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, diabetes mellitus, stomach cancer, and Parkinson&#x27;s disease: possibly through the damaging effect of nitrosamines on DNA; however, little has been done to control for other possible causes in the epidemiological results. Nitrosamines, formed in cured meats containing sodium nitrate and nitrite, have been linked to gastric cancer and esophageal cancer. Sodium nitrate and nitrite are associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer.

Substantial evidence in recent decades, facilitated by an increased understanding of pathological processes and science, exists in support of the theory that processed meat increases the risk of colon cancer and that this is due to the nitrate content. A small amount of the nitrate added to meat as a preservative breaks down into nitrite, in addition to any nitrite that may also be added. The nitrite then reacts with protein-rich foods (such as meat) to produce carcinogenic NOCs (nitroso compounds). NOCs can be formed either when meat is cured or in the body as meat is digested.

However, several things complicate the otherwise straightforward understanding that &quot;nitrates in food raise the risk of cancer&quot;. Processed meats have no fiber, vitamins, or phytochemical antioxidants, are high in sodium, may contain high fat, and are often fried or cooked at a temperature sufficient to degrade protein into nitrosamines. Nitrates are key intermediates and effectors in the primary vasculature signaling which is necessary for all mammals to survive.

<text>Southam () is a market town and civil parish in the Stratford-on-Avon district of Warwickshire, England, located about east-southeast of Leamington Spa. In the 2021 census, the population of Southam was 8,114.

== History ==
Southam was a Royal manor until AD 998, when Ethelred the Unready granted it to Earl Leofwine. When Coventry Priory was founded in 1043, Leofwine&#x27;s son Leofric, Earl of Mercia granted Southam to it. The Domesday Book records the manor as &quot;Sucham&quot;. The Priory, which in the 12th century became the first Coventry Cathedral, kept Southam until the 16th century when it surrendered all its estates to the Crown in the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

Southam developed at the intersection of several roads: the main road between Coventry and Oxford (now the A423 road), the main road from Warwick to Northampton via Daventry, and the ancient drovers&#x27; road known as Welsh Road. In 1227, the monks of Coventry Priory were granted a market charter for their manor at Southam, causing it to develop into a market town. Southam later received charters to hold three yearly fairs: Medieval fairs were special markets, held only a few times a year, which attracted buyers and sellers from longer distances than the normal weekly market. 

Southam&#x27;s Holy Well, in the picturesque Stowe river valley, is Grade II listed and a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and was first recorded in the year 998. The Well was used in medieval times by local monks and for hundreds of years as the town&#x27;s principal water supply. Water from a natural mineral spring feeds the semi-circular Well and pours through the mouths of carved stone gargoyles into the river. The water from the Well was said to cure eye complaints. The Holy Well and paths were renovated during 2005–2007 using a National Lottery grant.

Southam&#x27;s manor house in the centre of town is Grade II listed and dates from the 16th century. The present parish church of St James was built in the 14th century. In the 15th century the spire was added and the chancel was rebuilt. The nave&#x27;s clerestory and present roof were added in the 16th century, along with the present west door. St James&#x27; is a Grade I listed building.

In the 1540s John Leland visited the town and described it as &quot;a modest market town of a single street&quot;. William Shakespeare mentions Southam in &quot;Henry VI, part 3&quot;, Act V, Scene I, Lines 10–16:
&quot;WARWICK&quot;
 Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?
 And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?

&quot;SOMERSET&quot;
 At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
 And do expect him here some two hours hence.

&quot;WARWICK&quot;
 Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.

&quot;SOMERSET&quot;
 It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies:
 The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick.
In the English Civil War, King Charles I used Southam&#x27;s mint to make new coins to pay his troops. The grade II listed mint building dates from the early 16th century. It is now the Old Mint public house.

Charles I passed through Southam just before the outbreak of the Civil War and apparently was not made welcome by the townsfolk, who refused to ring the parish church bells. On 23 August 1642, the day after the King formally declared war on Parliament, a skirmish was fought outside the town between Parliamentary forces led by Lord Brooke and Royalist forces commanded by the Earl of Northampton. The Battle of Southam is claimed by locals to have been the first battle of the English Civil Wars. Later that year, Charles stayed at the Manor House in Southam before the Battle of Edgehill on 23 October 1642. In 1645 Oliver Cromwell and 7,000 Parliamentary troops stayed in the town.

In the stagecoach era Southam became an important stop on the coach road between Coventry and Oxford. Many old coaching inns remain in the town. However, few buildings in Southam date from before 1741, when a large fire devastated the town.

RAF Southam, about east of the town, was a World War II airfield. It was opened in 1940 and closed at the end of 1944. It was a training base and a relief landing ground.

Southam&#x27;s history is commemorated in Southam&#x27;s Cardall Collection.

=== Historic population ===
== Geography ==
Southam is about south-west of Rugby and west of Daventry, south-southeast of Coventry and north of Banbury.

Southam is situated on the River Stowe, a tributary of the River Itchen, which flows from Napton-on-the-Hill and joins the Itchen at Stoneythorpe, just outside the town.
== Economy ==

The dominant rock type for the area is Blue Lias limestone. For many years there was a cement factory and associated limestone quarry north of the town. The works was served at one time by both rail and canal transport — the latter being a short arm from the Grand Union Canal. The cement operations at Southam were owned by the Rugby Cement company. In 2000 cement production was relocated to Rugby, and Southam cement works was closed, but quarrying at the site still continues. The former cement works was demolished in 2011.

Southam is part of the area known as Silicon Spa: the area around Leamington Spa which is known for its concentration of companies involved in the video game industry: The computer games company, Codemasters, is based in Southam, and was founded by two locals. It was Europe&#x27;s largest privately owned computer games company, until its purchase by Electronic Arts in February 2021.

The railway rolling stock company Vivarail was based in Southam between 2019 and 2023 when it was dissolved.

South of the town is an industrial estate that is a significant source of local employment.

Southam has become a commuter town due to its road links and location. Taxi and minicab firms operate in the area and frequent bus services serve Southam and local villages.

== Politics ==
The principal local authorities administering Southam are Warwickshire County Council and Stratford-on-Avon District Council, each responsible for different aspects of local government. In addition to this, as a civil parish Southam has its own Town Council, which is represented by ten councillors from four wards.

Southam was the seat of the Southam Rural District from 1894 until 1974, when under the Local Government Act 1972 it was made part of Stratford-on-Avon District.

Southam was in the parliamentary constituency of Stratford-on-Avon until the boundary changes approved by Parliament in June 2007 when it became part of the new constituency of Kenilworth and Southam. The constituency was first contested in the 2010 United Kingdom general election.

== Facilities ==
=== Education ===
Southam has three primary schools and a secondary school (Southam College) with 1,643 students on roll from Southam and local villages. There is a leisure centre with swimming pool and gym next to the College on Welsh Road West.

=== Shopping ===

The main shopping area is based around High Street and Market Hill in the town centre. A French street market has run in High Street since the 1990s, it was restarted again in 2022 after being cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Religion ===

There are four churches in Southam. St James&#x27;s parish church is behind Market Hill. Both Our Lady and St Wulstan&#x27;s Catholic church and the Congregational chapel are on Wood Street, and the Community Church is on Coventry Street. There is also a small but active Bahá´í group in the town. The footpath from St James church along the protected Stowe valley to the historic Holy Well and on to Stoneythorpe Hall is a popular route for local people, ornithologists and other naturalists.

=== Sport and recreation ===
Southam Rugby Club was formed in 1962. In 1969 the club purchased pitches at Kineton Road and started playing home games. Over three years&#x27; money was raised to build the club house which was constructed mainly by the players and was opened in 1972. Today the club plays in the Midland League and has three senior teams and a colts team.

Southam United F.C. is the town&#x27;s association football club, and Southam also has a bowling club, a cricket club and the six pitch Dallas Burston Polo Club which includes conference and events facilities and the Millstone Hare pub and restaurant.

Southam is home to 2028 (Southam) Squadron Air Training Corps, a Royal Air Force-sponsored youth organisation for 13- to 20-year-olds. The squadron is based in Millar House, Wattons Lane.

There is a web of footpaths across fields and through woodland, with minimal need to use roads, giving foot access to surrounding villages.

=== Parks ===
Southam&#x27;s recreational ground, locally known simply as &#x27;the Rec&#x27;, is located on Park Lane; the land adjoins St James&#x27; churchyard which itself extends to Park Lane, the lower part of Market Hill and the upper part of Warwick Street. The bottom of the park is a bare field used mainly for ball games and the upper part contains various kinds of play equipment, with a separate area for very young children. The second largest park is at Tollgate Road, locally referred to as &#x27;Tollgate&#x27;. A small Zoo existed in the town between 1966 and 1985.

== Media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals can be received from the Sutton Coldfield TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC CWR, Heart West Midlands, Capital Mid-Counties, Hits Radio Coventry &amp; Warwickshire, Fresh (Coventry &amp; Warwickshire) and Greatest Hits Radio Midlands. The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;The Leamington Observer&quot;.

== Transport ==
===Road===
Southam lies between Leamington Spa and Daventry on the A425 road and between Coventry and Banbury on the A423 road. The A426 road connects it to Rugby. About south of Southam is the M40 motorway, though the town is surprisingly not indicated on the Junction 12 signage, despite being the main population centre in the immediate area.

Stagecoach Midlands run regular bus services connecting Southam with Leamington, Rugby and some of the local villages: like Napton and Long Itchington 
===Railway===
The nearest railway stations are , and .

Southam has never been directly served by its own railway station, although there were two within a few miles of the town: The Great Western Railway opened its line to Birmingham in 1852, and Southam had a station to the south-west, named . The station was closed to goods in 1963 and passengers in 1964 by British Railways (BR). The line is now part of the London Marylebone to Birmingham Chiltern Main Line.

The London and North Western Railway completed its Weedon to Marton Junction Line in 1895 and opened station on it north of Southam. British Railways closed the station to passengers in 1958 and goods in 1965, although the line remained open to goods trains serving the cement works until 1985.

The new High Speed 2 line will pass immediately south of Southam, but will have no stations between London and Birmingham.

<text>Warwick ( ) is a market town, civil parish and the county town of Warwickshire in the Warwick District in England, adjacent to the River Avon. It is south of Coventry, and south-east of Birmingham. It is adjoined with Leamington Spa and Whitnash.

Warwick has ancient origins and an array of historic buildings, notably from the Medieval, Stuart and Georgian eras. It was a major fortified settlement from the early Middle Ages, the most notable relic of this period being Warwick Castle, a major tourist attraction. Much was destroyed in the Great Fire of Warwick in 1694 and then rebuilt with fine 18th century buildings, such as the Collegiate Church of St Mary and the Shire Hall. The population was estimated at 36,665 at the 2021 Census.

==History==
===Neolithic===
Human activity on the site dates back to the Neolithic, when it appears there was a sizable settlement on the Warwick hilltop. Artifacts found include more than 30 shallow pits containing early Neolithic flints and pottery and a number of small post holes indicating rectangular buildings. These are believed to have been created by Early European Farmers, sometime between 4000 and 2351 BC. An arrowhead from the Bell Beaker culture was likewise found, believed to date from 2500 to 1700 BC.

===Roman===
Archaeological work on the site of Warwick School in 2017–2018 revealed the footings of a sizeable Roman barn from the 2nd century AD. Roman rule in Britain begin to break down with the Great Conspiracy in 367–368, the withdrawal of Roman troops from Britain from 383 to 406 and the barbarian raids of 408.

===Saxon===
Warwick was continuously inhabited from the 5th century onwards. There are three alternative explanations for town&#x27;s Old English name, Wæringwīc: 

(a) it may be composed of &quot;Wæring&quot;, which is a clan name or patronymic, and the suffix &quot;wīc,&quot; meaning a &#x27;settlement characterised by extensive artisanal activity and trade&#x27;; 

(b) alternatively, it may be derived from &quot;wering,&quot; meaning a &#x27;fortification&#x27; 

(c) or it may reflect a &#x27;weir,&#x27; the latter implying that the original settlement was located by a natural weir over the River Avon, possibly on the south side of the river, which offered easily cultivable land.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; for the year 914 reports that the Anglo-Saxon Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians, daughter of king Alfred the Great and sister of king Edward the Elder of Wessex, built a burh or fortified dwelling there on a hilltop site overlooking the earlier riverside settlement, as one of ten to defend Mercia from the Vikings. Warwick was chosen as a site for the burh because the local outcrop of sandstone alongside the Avon provided an easily defensible position at a strategic site by the river crossing, with a good source of water and building material.

In the early 10th century, a shire was founded with Warwick as its county town. During the reign of Æthelstan (924-939) a royal mint was established at Warwick. This was one of two established in Warwickshire at the time, the other being at Tamworth. The Warwick mint continued until the mid-12th century. In 1016 the Danes invaded Mercia and burned down much of Warwick including a nunnery, which stood on the site of today&#x27;s St Nicholas Church.

===Norman and medieval===

William the Conqueror founded Warwick Castle in 1068, while on his way to Yorkshire to deal with rebellion in the north. Building it involved pulling down four houses. The castle stood within the larger Anglo-Saxon burh and a new town wall was created close to the burh ramparts.

The prosperity of medieval Warwick rested on its status as an administrative and military centre, however it was poorly positioned from the point of view of trade, and was consequently never a commercial or industrial centre of more than local significance in medieval times. Medieval Warwick was controlled by various Earls of Warwick, mostly of the Beauchamp family. It became a walled town. It is unknown quite when the town wall was built, but references to it are found as early as the 12th century. It had mostly been demolished by the early 16th century.

Today the only remains are the east and west gatehouses, there was previously also a north gatehouse, but this was demolished. On the south side, the bridge over the Avon was said to fulfil the role of a gatehouse, and likely had a barrier. The west gate was first recorded in 1129, and had a chapel of St James above it, which was reconstructed in the 14th century and extensively restored in 1863–1865. The east gate was rebuilt in the 15th century with the Chapel of St Peter above it. It was rebuilt again in 1788 and was once used as part of The King&#x27;s High School, but is now a holiday home.

The town&#x27;s Priory was founded in around 1119 by Henry de Beaumont, the first Earl of Warwick. It was later destroyed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536, it stood on the site of the current Priory Park. Henry de Beaumont also founded the Hospital of St John near the east town gate. It is now the site of the 17th century St John&#x27;s House. Relatively few medieval buildings survive in Warwick, however one of the most notable examples is the Lord Leycester Hospital on the High Street, whose oldest parts date from 1383. Warwick was not incorporated as a borough until 1545.

===17th century===

During the English Civil War, the town and castle were garrisoned for Parliament under Sir Edward Peyto. In 1642 the castle underwent a two-week siege by the Royalists commanded by the Earl of Northampton, however, the besiegers lacked any cannons powerful enough to damage the castle. The siege collapsed when, on hearing of the approach of the Earl of Essex to Southam, Lord Northampton marched his force away towards Worcester. Major John Bridges was appointed governor of the castle in 1643, and a garrison was maintained there with artillery and other stores until 1659, which at its height in 1645 consisted of 302 soldiers.

The mid-17th century saw the founding of Castle Hill Baptist Church, one of the oldest Baptist churches in the world.

====Great fire of Warwick====

Much of the medieval town centre was destroyed in the Great Fire of Warwick on 5 September 1694, which, within five hours destroyed 460 buildings and left 250 families homeless. Thus most of the town-centre buildings are of late 17th and early 18th-century origin, although some medieval timber-framed buildings survive, especially around the edges of the town centre.

One of the aims of the rebuilding of Warwick following the fire, was to encourage the gentry and professional men to settle in the town, and so impetus was given to rebuilding the town in the then contemporary Georgian style. Many of the buildings in the rebuilt town were designed by the architects Francis Smith, and later William and David Hiorne, who gave Warwick its 18th century appearance. Daniel Defoe gave his opinion that Warwick had been &#x27;rebuilt in so noble and so beautiful a manner that few towns in England make so fine an appearance&#x27;.

The fire burnt down much of the medieval church of St Mary. However, the chancel and the Beauchamp Chapel survived, the latter having been built between 1443 and 1464 according to the wishes of Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, who had died in Rouen in 1439. A full-size reclining copper-gilt effigy of him lies on his Purbeck marble tomb – a fine piece of medieval metalwork cast in 1459.

===18th century to present===

In 1788 the Earl of Warwick obtained an Act of Parliament to enable him to build a new bridge over the Avon: Castle Bridge, which consists of a single sandstone arch was opened in 1793. It replaced an older 14th century bridge further downstream, known as Old Castle Bridge, which fell into ruin, although remains of it can still be seen. The Warwick and Birmingham and Warwick and Napton canals were both opened through Warwick in 1800. They now form parts of the Grand Union Canal.

The Borough of Warwick was reformed under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which reconstituted it as a municipal borough with an elected Town Council.

The railway arrived in Warwick in 1852 when the Great Western Railway opened its man line between Birmingham, Oxford and London through the town, along with Warwick railway station. However, the train service proved to be a disappointment to Warwick, as no express trains served the town, stopping at nearby Leamington Spa railway station instead. Warwick was largely bypassed by the Industrial Revolution; during the early 19th century, only minor industrial activities developed in the town, such as hat making. By the early 20th century, some engineering industry had been established locally.

The Warwick Pageant was a major festival in the grounds of Warwick Castle in 1906, organised by Louis N. Parker from a house in Jury Street. As Pageant House, this subsequently served as the offices of Warwick Borough Council, until the enlarged Warwick District Council was formed in Leamington Spa in 1974.

The Leamington &amp; Warwick Tramways &amp; Omnibus Company was established in 1881, and operated a tramway service between Warwick and Leamington Spa until 1930. It ran across Portobello Bridge, a three-arch bridge built 1831 to connect the two towns.

In 2021 it was announced that Warwick had entered a competition with 38 other contenders to be awarded city status as part of the Platinum Jubilee Civic Honours. However, it was not among the eight winners ultimately chosen in May 2022.

===Population change===
Populations before the 1801 census can be based on indirect measures. Historians suggest that Warwick had a population of about 1,500 in 1086. Indicators for ensuing centuries are sparse; however, by the mid-16th century, it is thought to have been about 2,000, which increased by the late 17th century to over 3,000. At the time of the first national census in 1801, Warwick had 5,592 inhabitants. This population nearly doubled by 1851, when it reached 10,952; thereafter, growth was slower for more than a century, reaching 15,349 in 1951 and 16,051 in 1961. Since then it has almost doubled, to 31,315 in 2011.

==Governance==

There are three tiers of local government covering Warwick, at parish (town), district, and county level: Warwick Town Council, Warwick District Council and Warwickshire County Council. The town council is based at the Court House on Jury Street, which was completed in 1731. The district council, although taking its name from Warwick, is based in the neighbouring town of Leamington Spa. Warwickshire County Council has its headquarters at Shire Hall, a complex of buildings between Market Place and Northgate Street in the centre of Warwick.
Population growth has led to Warwick adjoining its larger and younger neighbour Leamington Spa and also Whitnash as part of a conurbation of some 95,000 inhabitants.

Warwick is represented in Parliament as part of the Warwick and Leamington constituency, the seat from 1923 to 1957 of Anthony Eden, who was Britain&#x27;s Prime Minister from 1955 to 1957. It has been held by the Labour Party since the 2017 general election, when Matt Western was elected as the constituency&#x27;s MP. From the 1945 general election until 1997, the constituency elected a Conservative MP. In the 1997 United Kingdom general election, a Labour MP was elected; he held the seat until 2010, when Chris White was elected for the Conservatives. White lost his seat when Theresa May called a snap election in 2017.

==Geography==

The 17th-century antiquarian William Dugdale wrote that Warwick was &quot;standing upon a rocky ascent from every side, and in a dry and fertile soil, having... rich and pleasant meadows on the south part... and... woodland on the north.&quot; Two factors have affected Warwick&#x27;s built environment: the Great Fire of 1694 and the lack of industrialisation. In the 19th century, the widespread industrialisation of England largely passed Warwick by. One reason was that the town did not lie on important roads and the River Avon was not navigable as far as Warwick.

===Suburbs===
Suburbs of Warwick include Bridge End, Cliff Hill, Emscote, Woodloes Park, Forbes, Myton (connecting Warwick with Leamington Spa), Packmores, The Cape, The Percy, Warwick Gates, Chase Meadow and Myton Green. Warwick Gates is a housing estate and business park in Heathcote, south-east Warwick, which was built in the late 1990s. Although separated from Warwick town centre by open fields, Warwick Gates falls within the Warwick South and Bishops Tachbrook parish.

It is adjacent to Whitnash, a small town near Leamington Spa, and the village of Bishops Tachbrook. The Tachbrook Park and Heathcote industrial estates are also nearby. The NHS Leamington Spa Hospital is adjacent to Warwick Gates. In the early 2010s another new estate, Chase Meadow, was built to the south-west of the town next to Warwick Racecourse. Its amenities include a public house, a Chinese takeaway and a fish and chip shop. Ten year later a new estate south of Myton, named Myton Green was built.

===Climate===
Warwick experiences the usual English maritime climate, marked by a narrow temperature range, mild winters and cool summers. The nearest official Met Office weather station is at Wellesbourne, about 6 miles (10 km) south of the town centre and at a similar elevation. The absolute maximum temperature (also the absolute maximum for the county of Warwickshire) stands at recorded in August 1990. During a typical year, the warmest day should reach , and 16.5 days should report a maximum of or higher. The lowest recorded temperature is , recorded in January 1982. Typically, 53.3 air frosts are recorded in an &quot;average&quot; year. Rainfall averages out at per year, with over 114 days seeing or more falling. All averages refer to the 1971–2000 period.

==Demography==
At the 2011 census, there were 31,345 residents in Warwick in 14,226 households, and the median age of Warwick residents was 39. In terms of ethnicity:

*88.1% of Warwick residents were White British (Comprising 84.1% White British, 2.9% Other White, and 1.1% Irish)
*7.9% were Asian (Comprising 5.4% Indian, 0.8% Chinese, 0.4% Pakistani, 0.1% Bangladeshi and 1.2% from another Asian background)
*0.7% were Black (Comprising 0.4% African, 0.3% Caribbean and 0.1% other Black)
*2.2% were Mixed
*0.2% were Arab, and 0.9% were from another ethnic group.

In terms of religion, 58.0% of Warwick residents identified as Christian, 26.9% said they had no religion, 7.4% did not state any religion, 4.6% were Sikh, 1.3% were Hindu, 1.0% were Muslim, 0.4% were Buddhists, 0.2% were Jewish and 0.4% were from another religion.

==Economy==

Due to its proximity to north–south and east–west motorway routes, many companies have a head office in the town. Since November 2004, National Grid UK has had its United Kingdom headquarters on the Warwick Technology Park south of the town near the A452 road. Phillips 66 and their petrol station group, JET, have an office on the Technology Park. Other businesses with head offices here include lingerie company Bravissimo. IBM, Wolseley and Volvo Group UK have bases on the Wedgnock Industrial Estate in the north of the town, near to the A46 trunk road. Other companies with regional headquarters in Warwick include Bridgestone, Calor, Kantar and Delphi Automotive. In recent years several high-profile national and international companies have set up large office complexes in and around Warwick, notably National Grid and IBM. There is also an out-of-town retail park called Leamington Shopping Park (formerly &quot;The Shires Retail Park&quot;).

==Culture==

Warwick hosts several annual festivals, including: the spoken word; classical and contemporary music; a folk festival; and a Victorian Evening, held in late November or early December. St. Mary&#x27;s Church hosts a series of Early Music concerts, and the Bridge House Theatre hosts the Music-in-Round concerts. Warwick Chamber of Trade helps to promote the town for visitors, residents and businesses. The town is also famous for Warwick Castle, whose construction began in 1068. The town centre is also known for its mixture of Tudor and 17th-century buildings.

Warwick is also known for Warwick Racecourse, near the west gate of the medieval town, which hosts several televised horse racing meetings a year. Within the racecourse is a small golf course. J. R. R. Tolkien seems to have been very influenced by Warwick (where he was married in the Catholic Church of Saint Mary Immaculate and is commemorated by a blue plaque) and by its Mercian connections: Lynn Forest-Hill, in an article in the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; (TLS 8 July 2005 pp 12–13) argues cogently that two important settlements in Tolkien&#x27;s work were modelled on Warwick – Edoras closely on the early town, and Minas Tirith more remotely on the Norman; and that aspects of the plot of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; are paralleled in the romance known as Guy of Warwick. Christopher Tolkien, in &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;, stated that Kortirion, the main city of Tol Eressëa, &quot;would become in after days Warwick.&quot;

Warwick and its historic buildings have featured in a number of television series, including the BBC&#x27;s drama series &quot;Dangerfield&quot;, the period dramas &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; and &quot;Tom Jones&quot; and Granada Television&#x27;s &quot;Moll Flanders&quot;. Parts of the town substituted for Elizabethan and Jacobean era London in the third-series episode two (&quot;The Shakespeare Code&quot;) of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; which ran 7 April 2007. Filming took place in June 2019 for &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, which was screened on United Kingdom television at Christmas 2019.

===Museums===

The Warwickshire Museum has two sites in Warwick, firstly the historic 17th century Market Hall in the Market Square, which hosts collections which are primarily focused on objects in the fields of archaeology, geology and natural history, and particularly those local to Warwickshire. Secondly, the 17th century St John&#x27;s House, which hosts, among other things, a full sized replica of a Victorian kitchen and classroom, and the Royal Warwickshire Regiment of Fusiliers Museum.

=== Local media ===
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Lark Stoke TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter in Leamington Spa.

Warwick&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC CWR on 103.7 FM, Capital Mid-Counties on 107.3 FM, Hits Radio Coventry &amp; Warwickshire on 102.9 FM and Fresh (Coventry &amp; Warwickshire), DAB radio station.

Local newspapers are the Warwickshire Telegraph and The Boar, a student newspaper for the University of Warwick.

==Hospitals==
Warwick Hospital, Leamington Spa Hospital and St Michael&#x27;s Hospital (a psychiatric unit that superseded Central Hospital) are in the town.

==Sport==

Warwick Racecourse is located just west of the town centre. Adjacent to it is Racing Club Warwick F.C., founded in 1919. The city has many long-established sports clubs, including Warwick Hockey Club, founded in 1920.

==Education==
===Schools===
Secondary schools in Warwick include Warwick School, an independent day and boarding school for boys. The King&#x27;s High School For Girls is also independent, but Myton School and Aylesford School are state-run co-educational schools. Campion School and Trinity Catholic School in Leamington include parts of Warwick in their catchment areas. Warwick Preparatory School is an independent day school and nursery for boys aged 3–7 and girls 3–11. It is part of the Warwick Independent Schools Foundation, together with King&#x27;s High School and Warwick School.

===Warwick School===

Warwick School is an independent school for boys which claims to be the oldest boys&#x27; school in England. The actual foundation date is unknown, although 914 has sometimes been quoted. For some years the school claimed that King Edward the Confessor (–1066) chartered it, although there is no clear evidence for this and King Henry VIII re-founded it in 1545. Whatever the case, there has undoubtedly been a grammar school in the town of Warwick since before the Norman Conquest. Its present successor has occupied its current site south of the River Avon since 1879.

===University of Warwick===
The nearest university is the University of Warwick, which is named after the county of Warwickshire, rather than the town, and is in fact situated several miles north of Warwick on the southern outskirts of Coventry. Adding to the location confusion is the fact that Coventry is no longer in the county of Warwickshire, but instead is in the West Midlands, leading to the current situation where the university straddles both counties.

==Transport==
===Road===
Warwick is on the M40 London-Birmingham motorway, connected to junctions 13, 14 and 15; it is also on the A46 dual-carriageway trunk road positioned between Coventry and Stratford-upon-Avon. Warwick has several council off-street car parks in the town. There are also a few privately run car parks, including those at the railway station and the castle.

===Rail===

The town has two railway stations, both on the Chiltern Main Line: Located a short distance north of the town centre is Warwick railway station, which has direct rail services to Leamington Spa, London, Birmingham and Stratford-upon-Avon; these services are provided by Chiltern Railways. In addition, a few peak-hour trains to and from Birmingham are operated by West Midlands Trains. The second station is Warwick Parkway, an out-of-town station opened in 2000 on the western outskirts of the town, this provides frequent services to London and Birmingham. Historically, the Leamington &amp; Warwick Tramways &amp; Omnibus Company operated between the towns from 1881 to 1930.

===Bus and coach===

Bus services to Leamington Spa, Stratford-upon-Avon and Coventry are operated by Stagecoach in Warwickshire from the bus station in the town centre. There is also a National Express coach stop in the town&#x27;s bus station with limited services. The nearby Warwick Parkway railway station also has a coach stop with more frequent services.

===Waterways===

The Grand Union Canal passes through Warwick. The restored Saltisford Canal Arm is close to the town centre – it is a short branch of the Grand Union Canal, the remains of the original terminus of the Warwick and Birmingham Canal, dating back to 1799. The Saltisford Canal Trust has restored most of the surviving canal, which is now the mooring for colourful narrowboats and a waterside park open to the public.

The River Avon which also passes through the town is not navigable as far as Warwick; the navigable stretch of the river currently ends at Stratford-upon-Avon. There have been proposals made to extend the Avon navigation to Warwick, which would involve the construction of seven new locks, some dredging, and some new canal sections. The most recent proposals, which would have seen the river linked with the Grand Union Canal at Warwick, failed to win the support of the local council in 2019.

===Air===
The nearest international airport to Warwick is Birmingham Airport, about by road from the town centre. There also used to be a Royal Air Force station called RAF Warwick.

==Notable people==
==Twin towns==
The town of Warwick has formal twinning arrangements with two European towns:
*Saumur, France (since 1976)
*Verden, Germany (since 1989)
There is also a friendship link between Warwick District and Bo District in Sierra Leone.

<text>Marie-Josèphe dite Angélique (died June 21, 1734) was the name given to a Portuguese-born black slave in New France by her last owners. She was tried and convicted of setting fire to her owner&#x27;s home, burning much of what is now referred to as Old Montreal. It had been generally accepted that Angélique was guilty, but it has recently been argued that she was innocent of the crime and was convicted more on the basis of her reputation as a rebellious runaway slave than on the basis of factual evidence. A competing theory is that she was guilty of the crime but was acting in rebellion against slavery. No consensus has been reached by historians regarding Angélique&#x27;s actual guilt or innocence.
==Early life==
Angélique was born around 1705 in Madeira, a possession of Portugal in the Atlantic. She died on June 21 1734 as states at the beginning of this. At some point, she was in possession of a Flemish man named Nichus Block or Nicolas Bleeker who brought her to the New World. She lived in New England before being sold in 1725 to an important French businessman from Montreal named François Poulin de Francheville, and after his death in 1733, belonged to his wife Thérèse de Couagne. Slavery in New England and New France was primarily a domestic affair, since unlike the southern part of what would become the United States, the economy was not based on large-scale plantation labour. Angélique therefore worked in the Francheville home in Montreal, and occasionally helped on the family&#x27;s small farm on the island of Montreal, which was primarily used to produce supplies for Francheville&#x27;s trading expeditions.

Angélique had three children while in Montréal: a boy born in 1731 who lived only one month and twins in 1732, who both died within five months. The father listed in the baptismal records was Jacques César, a black slave from Madagascar who belonged to Ignace Gamelin, a friend of Francheville. It is not known whether Angélique and César were lovers by choice or whether they were forced by their owners to have children (the children of slaves became themselves slaves and the property of the mother&#x27;s owners).

During the year preceding the fire and the trial, Angélique became involved in a relationship with a white indentured servant, Claude Thibault, who was employed by the Franchevilles. Following the death of Francheville in November 1733, Mme Francheville became occupied with many transactions in the course of operating his businesses and settling his estate. Early in 1734, being occupied with estate affairs in Trois-Rivières, the widow asked her brother-in-law Alexis Monière to keep both her slave and her indentured servant Claude Thibault for her until her return.

On February 22, while the widow Francheville was still away, Angélique and Thibault attempted to escape to New England, fleeing across the frozen St. Lawrence river and stopping to retrieve bread that Thibault had hidden in a barn in Longueuil in preparation for their flight. However, the difficulty of winter travel forced the two to take refuge in Châteauguay, near the Chambly road, until the weather improved. They were captured a couple of weeks later and returned to Montreal by three militia captains, acting in their capacity as local police. Thibault was imprisoned on March 5 and only released on April 8, the day before the fire. Angélique visited him several times while he was in jail and brought him food.

Angélique was simply returned to Madame de Francheville, who did not have her disciplined in any way for her attempted flight, possibly because she was already planning to sell her. As mentioned during the trial, Thérèse de Francheville found herself unable to control Angélique and intended to accept an offer by one of her deceased husband&#x27;s business associates, François-Étienne Cugnet, to purchase her for 600 pounds of gunpowder. The offer was conditional on the widow covering expenses for sending Angélique to Quebec City, where Cugnet lived. Fear of being sold and possibly ending up in the West Indies may have been a factor in the attempted escape.

Tension was high between the slave and her mistress. The widow Francheville dismissed a free servant, Louise Poirier, because of squabbling and disagreements between slave and servant. Angélique promised her that she could do all the work better than Poirier, possibly hoping that a good performance on her part would make her mistress relent and keep her. The widow gave in, but promised Poirier that she would contact her after Angélique had been shipped to Quebec City.

After Thibault&#x27;s release, he visited de Couagne to demand his outstanding wages. She paid them but warned Thibault never to set foot in her house again. Angry, she also confirmed to him that Angélique had in fact been sold and would be shipped to Quebec City as soon as the ice cleared. Thibault ignored the order to stay away and visited Angélique several times while de Couagne was not at home. As this was early April, they both would have known that the St. Lawrence River would soon be passable to ships, and that Angélique would not be in Montreal much longer. Angélique told a servant that she intended to run away again, and it is possible that the two discussed setting a fire to cover their escape.

==Fire of April 10, 1734==
At seven o&#x27;clock in the evening on Saturday, April 10, 1734, inhabitants of Montreal were leaving evening prayer when the sentry sounded the alarm, &quot;Fire!&quot; A fire had started on the south side of rue Saint-Paul and was spreading east of rue Saint-Joseph (rue Saint-Sulpice). The fire was so intense that the law enforcement officers could not get close to it. Many people tried to take shelter at the Hôtel-Dieu, but due to a strong wind blowing from the west, the fire spread and destroyed the hospital in less than three hours. Forty-five houses were also destroyed, and due to people taking advantage of the general panic, many items were stolen from homes and from the convent.

The following journal entry of Sister Véronique Cuillerier illustrates the suddenness of the fire, and the difficulty of trying to control it:

Rumours began to circulate accusing Angélique of having set the fire; later in the evening, the convent&#x27;s gardener, Louis Bellefeuille dit LaRuine, even told her face-to-face about these rumours, although she denied them. The origin of the rumours seems to have been comments made by Marie-Manon, the young &quot;panis&quot; slave owned by De Couagne&#x27;s neighbours, the Bérey des Essars, who claimed she had heard Angélique saying that her mistress would not sleep in her house that night. By the time the fire had gone out, popular opinion held that Angélique had set the fire. She was found in the garden of the paupers of the Hôtel-Dieu and taken to the king&#x27;s gaols to wait for a formal charge to be filed against her. A warrant was also issued later for Thibault, but although he was seen again on the Tuesday morning following the fire (two days later), by the time the bailiffs set out to arrest him he had disappeared and was never seen again in New France.

==Trial and execution==
Angélique was charged and tried. French law at the time allowed a suspect to be arrested based on &quot;public knowledge&quot;, when the community agreed that a suspect was guilty. Over the next six weeks, the prosecution called a large number of witnesses, none of whom testified to have seen Angélique set the fire, but all of whom claimed they were certain that she had done it. They testified at length as to Angélique&#x27;s character as a badly behaved slave who often spoke back to her owners, but no solid evidence was presented as to her culpability for the fire.

Frustrated by the lack of sufficient evidence to condemn Angélique, the prosecution contemplated asking for permission to apply torture prior to a definitive judgment, a highly unusual procedure which was rarely allowed in New France. However, an eyewitness suddenly appeared: the five-year-old daughter of Alexis Monière, Amable, testified that she had seen Angélique carrying a shovelful of coals up to the attic of the house on the afternoon the fire started. This evidence finally allowed the prosecutor to close his case and the judge and the four commissioners he summoned to participate in the sentence all concurred that Angélique was guilty. Beaugrand-Champagne points out that no one questioned why it took so long for Amable to come forward in a city where the fire and the trial was likely to have been widely discussed; she attributes this willingness to credit the little girl&#x27;s testimony to the fact that too many people had lost too much and a scapegoat was necessary.

The sentence included the following instructions:

And everything Considered, We have Declared the Said accused, Marie Joseph Angelique Sufficiently guilty And Convicted of Having set fire to the house of dame francheville Causing the Burning of a portion of the city. In Reparation for which we have Condemned her to make honourable amends Disrobed, a Noose around her Neck, and carrying In her hands a flaming torch weighing two pounds before the main door and Entrance of the parish Church of This city where She will be taken And Led, by the executioner of the high Court, in a Tumbrel used for garbage, with an Inscription Front And Back, with the word, Incendiary, And there, bare-headed, And On her Knees, will declare that She maliciously set the fire And Caused the Said Burning, for which She repents And Asks Forgiveness from the Crown And Court, and this done, will have her fist Severed On a stake Erected in front of the Said Church. Following which, she will be led by the said Executioner in the same tumbrel to the Public Place to there Be bound to the Stake with iron shackles And Burned alive, her Body then Reduced To Ashes And Cast to the Wind, her Belongings taken And Remanded to the King, the said accused having previously been subjected to torture in the ordinary And Extraordinary ways in order to have her Reveal her Accomplices
The sentence was automatically appealed to the Superior Council by the prosecutor, as was required by the Ordinance on criminal procedure of 1670. Angélique was thus sent off to Quebec City where, a week later, the appeals court confirmed their belief in Angélique&#x27;s guilt while reducing somewhat the savagery of the trial court&#x27;s sentence, so that Angélique was no longer to have her hand cut off or be burnt alive, but rather to be hanged and once dead, her body burned and the ashes scattered. The council also dispensed with the requirement to have her carried through the town on a rubbish cart wearing a sign declaring her an arsonist. However, the sentence still required her to be tortured to identify her accomplices, the Councillors apparently believing, as did the Montreal court, that Angélique had not acted alone, especially as Thibault had disappeared a couple of days after the fire and never been found. This type of torture was called the &quot;question préalable&quot; (torture prior to execution) and aimed at making the convicted criminal confess or denounce any possible accomplices or both.

A few days later, the prisoner was back in Montréal, and on June 21, the court proceeded to read the revised sentence to her and prepare her for the &quot;question&quot;. Angélique steadfastly refused to confess or name any accomplices, even faced with the boot, an instrument of torture consisting of an assemblage of wooden planks bound to the prisoner&#x27;s legs. The judge then instructed the Colony&#x27;s executioner and &quot;master of torture&quot;, a black slave named Mathieu Leveillé, to apply the &quot;question ordinaire&quot; (four strokes of a hammer driving a wedge between the planks, thus applying increasing pressure which gradually crushes the prisoner&#x27;s legs). Angélique broke almost immediately and confessed her guilt but still maintained that she had acted alone. The judge ordered the &quot;question extraordinaire&quot; (four strokes on an additional wedge, inserted at the ankles) and Angélique, while repeating that she and she alone had set the fire, begged the court to end her misery and hang her.

On the afternoon of the same day, Angélique was taken one last time through the streets of Montreal and, after the stop at the church for her &quot;amende honorable&quot; mounted a scaffold facing the ruins of the buildings destroyed by the fire and there was hanged, then strangled until dead, her body flung into a fire and the ashes scattered in the wind.

==Conflicting interpretations==
The historiography of Angélique&#x27;s story is not extensive, as only a few professional historians have looked at her case until quite recently, and most of the older work dealt with her superficially and rapidly, in a paragraph or page or two, as part of larger works on slavery or crime in New France. The older works all agreed with the opinion of the judges—Angélique set the fire to revenge herself on her owner. However, the first full-length non-fictional account of her trial, written by Denyse Beaugrand-Champagne and published in Quebec in French in 2004, was also the first serious study to use all the trial records. The author sets out to present the documents in detail, to question the court proceedings and to present all the possible culprits. She concludes that the fire was most likely accidental, the result of poorly cleaned chimneys and a cook fire in the neighbouring house—a cook fire manned by Marie-Manon, the young &quot;panis&quot; slave who started the rumours about Angélique, having said that her owner would not sleep in her bed. In this interpretation, Marie-Manon, who could have been severely punished by her owners had she been implicated in accidentally causing the fire, had plenty of motivation for diverting suspicion elsewhere. Beaugrand-Champagne believes that the authorities, under pressure by an enraged population looking for a scapegoat for their troubles, took the easy way out and condemned Angélique more on the basis of her independent and outspoken character than on any genuine evidence.

Two years later, Afua Cooper published a book on Angélique in English, which champions the thesis that Angélique did start the 1734 fire, as a justified rebellion against her owner and as a cover for an escape attempt. Cooper&#x27;s book criticizes white Canadians for what she sees as trying to downplay or deny the reality of slavery in Canada&#x27;s past. She claims that the transcript of Angélique&#x27;s trial can be seen as the first slave narrative in the New World.

A comparative critical review by Evelyn Kolish finds Beaugrand-Champagne&#x27;s work to be more trustworthy, while pointing out some serious flaws in Cooper&#x27;s methodology. Kolish characterizes Cooper&#x27;s book as &quot;un texte qui se situe à mi-chemin entre le roman historique et l&#x27;essai journalistique anti-esclavagiste&quot; (&quot;English&quot;: &quot;a text that is situated halfway between an historical novel and a journalistic anti-slavery essay&quot;). No consensus has been reached by the modern historical community on Angélique&#x27;s guilt or innocence.

Since the prosecution at her trial did not meet their burden of proof, by today&#x27;s standards, it is impossible to know for sure whether she was guilty. Fortunately, the exceptional wealth of detail afforded by the trial transcripts, and a great deal of important contextual documentation, including both secondary and primary sources, is now readily available to everyone in English translation, on the pedagogical site. The original French manuscripts are available on the website of Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec.
Regardless of whether Angélique was innocent or guilty, her story provided more insight on the conditions of slavery in Canada. Allan Greer used the records of her trial to gain a fuller sense of the life of a slave in eighteenth-century Montreal. Placing that experience in context, he notes that &quot;there were degrees and varieties of unfreedom&quot; in this society that affected servants, engagés, apprentices and soldiers; of course, slavery was uniquely horrible in the way it denied the humanity of the enslaved. &quot;Complex and even intimate, the relationships of early Canadian slavery were nevertheless founded upon an underlying brutality that comes to the surface in the story of Angélique.&quot;

==Legacy==
Angélique&#x27;s dramatic story has inspired several novels, plays and poems or songs about her. One, the play &quot;Angélique&quot; by Lorena Gale, loosely based on an unpublished translation of the trial transcripts by Denyse Beaugrand-Champagne, won the 1995 du Maurier National Playwriting Competition in Canada. Angélique appears almost as a legendary figure, and parts of her story have taken on a life of their own in countries such as Haiti, where, irrespective of documentary evidence, the tale that she was burnt alive with her hand cut off is still told, as if the original sentence had not been reduced. Cooper&#x27;s book rallies the opinions of other contemporary black authors, such as the poet George Elliott Clarke, who wrote her preface. Such authors see her as an &quot;immortal avatar of liberation&quot; and prefer to see her as an active rebel rather than a victim of a miscarriage of justice. Others, like Beaugrand-Champagne, find her just as inspiring as an exceptional, outspoken, independent-minded woman, who fought for her freedom and her life with courage and wit, against formidable odds, and in spite of a society that expected submission from women, especially if they were also black and slaves.

In 2012, a public square in Montreal, facing City Hall, was named Place Marie-Josèphe-Angélique.

In 2016, a short film entitled &quot;C’est Moi&quot; by Howard J Davis, explored the history of Angélique set against the sesquarcentennial anniversary of Montreal.

<text>Christian Death is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles County, California, in 1979 by Rozz Williams. With major line-up changes over the years, Christian Death has retained &quot;a relentlessly confrontational stand against organized religion and conventional morality&quot;.

Williams was eventually joined by guitarist Rikk Agnew of the band Adolescents, James McGearty on bass guitar and George Belanger on drums. This line-up was responsible for producing the band&#x27;s best known work, their 1982 debut studio album &quot;Only Theatre of Pain&quot;, which was highly influential in the development of the style of music known as deathrock, as well as on the American gothic scene which also produced bands such as Kommunity FK and 45 Grave.

Following the release of &quot;Only Theatre of Pain&quot;, Christian Death&#x27;s line-up fell apart, and by the time of the band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Catastrophe Ballet&quot; (1984), Rozz had been joined by Valor Kand of tour mates Pompeii 99 on vocals and guitar. Following the release of the band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Ashes&quot;, in 1985, Williams left the band and Kand became frontperson, with no original members of the band remaining. This resulted in a divide in the band&#x27;s fanbase and created controversy that has continued to this day.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;Only Theatre of Pain&quot; (1979–1982)===
Guitarist John &quot;Jay&quot; Albert, vocalist Rozz Williams, bassist James McGearty and drummer George Belanger formed Christian Death in October 1979. At this time, the band was a punk rock band musically indebted to the Germs. As the band progressed their music slowed and began to incorporate religious symbolism. Their first live performance was an impromptu set at the Hong Kong Cafe in Los Angeles supporting Castration Squad, replacing Killer Pussy after they were booed off stage.

After a physical altercation involving Belanger took place, he was left unable to play drums for their upcoming show on February 14, 1981. Williams asked Steve Darrow to fill in, however Belanger decided moments before their set to still try and play, leading to Belanger performing the first few songs then Darrow finishing the set. This incident angered Albert, who left the band permanently mid-set. Subsequently, Christian Death was halted, with Albert and Williams forming noise band Daucus Karota with drummer Mary Torcivia. Williams, McGearty and Belanger regrouped a few months later, now accompanied by guitarist Rikk Agnew, who had just left the Adolescents. With this lineup, they made their first vinyl appearance with the song &quot;Dogs&quot; on the 1981 L.A. scene compilation album &quot;Hell Comes to Your House&quot;. The following year, they signed with Frontier Records and released their debut studio album, &quot;Only Theatre of Pain&quot;, on March 24.

The following year Belanger left the band after becoming disheartened by the growing darkness of the band&#x27;s image and increasing drug abuse. Belanger&#x27;s role was filled by Rod &quot;China&quot; Figueroa, whose first performance with the band was a record signing on April 10, 1982. Later that year, while the band were getting ready for a domestic tour, Agnew, distressed by his own drug use and troubles in his relationship, began to experience panicked episodes where he would imagine Williams and his boyfriend Ron Athey being subject to homophobic attacks in Southern states and the band being arrested for drug possession. This culminated in him leaving the band as they were preparing to go on stage. The band then hired Mikaleno Amundson to play guitar, who moved in with Figueroa. However, when Amundson and Figueroas&#x27; girlfriends fell out with each other, Amundson was forced to move out and leave the band after &quot;about three to five shows.&quot; Because of this, Eva O briefly became the band&#x27;s guitarist. On October 30, 1982, this lineup opened for Angelic Upstarts at SIR Studios alongside Pompeii 99. Following this, Michael Montano and Johnnie Sage both began playing guitar in the band, and they played again with Pompeii 99. By the end of the year, McGearty had left the band. With Williams as the only founding member remaining, Christian Death disbanded.

===Reformation, &quot;Catastrophe Ballet&quot; and &quot;Ashes&quot; (1983–1985)===
Around this point, Pompeii 99 too were going through a number of lineup changes. Subsequently, six months after Christian Death&#x27;s disbandment, Williams joined Pompeii 99, which at that time consisted of only guitarist and vocalist Valor Kand and drummer David &quot;Glass&quot; Parkinson. Under Williams&#x27; suggestion, the band&#x27;s session keyboard player and Kand&#x27;s partner Gitane DeMone officially joined the band. After Williams was approached by Yann Farcy of French record label L&#x27;Invitation au Suicide to record another Christian Death album and tour Europe, the band hired bassist Constance Smith (later Redgrave) and changed their name to Christian Death. This culminated in Christian Death&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Catastrophe Ballet&quot; (1984). Recorded at Rockfield Studios in Monmouth, Wales, much of this album&#x27;s instrumentals were written by Kand, with Williams contributing entirely to lyrics and partially to melody writing. It was a departure from the band&#x27;s angry punk-influenced style and was dedicated to surrealist André Breton. While in France, Smith departed from the group due to a mental health struggle, being replaced by Dave Roberts of Sex Gang Children. In autumn 1984, the band returned to America and recorded &quot;Ashes&quot;, which was released the following year.

===Valor Kand era (1985–present)===

In mid-1985, Williams departed from the group, frustrated by Kand&#x27;s increasing control of the band and perceived disregard for how touring affected the members&#x27; ventures outside of music. He originally planned to do this under the pretext that DeMone would also be leaving, however she soon decided not to, as that would also mean separating Kand from their child together. Following Williams&#x27; departure, the remaining members made an effort to change the band&#x27;s name to Sin and Sacrifice, transitioning to that name through booking their next tour as the Sin and Sacrifice of Christian Death. However, the promoters did not adhere to this change, instead having them booked as simply Christian Death. This issue then became exacerbated once they were offered a record deal by Supporti Fonografici which they could only accept if they continued on as Christian Death. Augmented by bassist Johann Schumann and guitarist and keyboardist Barry Galvin, the band recorded an EP for Supporti Fonografici titled &quot;The Wind Kissed Pictures&quot;, credited to &quot;For Sin and Sacrifice Must We Die a Christian Death&quot;. The EP was later reissued in Germany and the U.S., credited to Christian Death.

Their first post-Williams studio album was 1986&#x27;s &quot;Atrocities&quot;, a concept album about the aftereffects of World War II on the European psyche, which was followed by 1987&#x27;s &quot;The Scriptures&quot;, recorded by a revamped line-up of Kand, DeMone, Glass, guitarist James Beam and bassist Kota. Longtime drummer Glass left the group following the release of &quot;The Scriptures&quot; and returned to California, where he eventually worked with several Williams side projects.

The band had their biggest successes on the UK Independent Chart with the 1987–89 singles &quot;Sick of Love&quot;, &quot;Church of No Return&quot; and &quot;Zero Sex&quot; and the 1988 studio album &quot;Sex and Drugs and Jesus Christ&quot;. Following the &quot;Zero Sex&quot; single, DeMone opted to leave the band.

Valor recorded the two-part &quot;All the Love All the Hate&quot; concept album (1989) in collaboration with Nick the Bastard, which spawned the double A-side single &quot;We Fall Like Love&quot;/&quot;I Hate You&quot;.

During the late 1980s, while also recording as Shadow Project, Williams resurrected his own version of Christian Death, with his wife Eva O contributing guitar as well as vocals. Billing themselves as the original Christian Death, they were rejoined by first-album guitarist Agnew for a 1989 tour of Canada. The band was signed to Cleopatra Records, and released &quot;The Iron Mask&quot; studio album and &quot;Skeleton Kiss&quot; EP in 1992. Williams&#x27; reclamation of the Christian Death name sparked a fierce battle with Kand. However, Kand already had the rights to the name due to Williams&#x27; departure from the band and subsequent neglect of the moniker. Williams consequently billed his version of the band as &quot;Christian Death featuring Rozz Williams&quot;. After this, Williams&#x27; version released &quot;The Path of Sorrows&quot; studio album in 1993 and &quot;The Rage of Angels&quot; in 1994. A 1993 show featuring &quot;Only Theatre of Pain&quot;-era members Williams, Agnew and Belanger (along with bassist Casey Chaos) performing live at Los Angeles&#x27; Patriot Hall was recorded and later released in 2001 as a DVD by Cleopatra. Williams pursued other projects before committing suicide on April 1, 1998.

Meanwhile, Kand&#x27;s Christian Death continued performing and recording, issuing the studio album &quot;Insanus, Ultio, Proditio, Misercordiaque&quot; (1990), on which Kand conducted the English Abbey Choir and the Commonwealth Chamber Orchestra. The band added bassist Maitri in 1991. Her first concert with Christian Death took place at the Contemporary Festival, held at the Anfitheatro delle Cascine in Florence, Italy on 12 July 1991. The band released the studio album &quot;Sexy Death God&quot; in 1994, the double-live set &quot;Amen&quot; in 1995, the Nostradamus-themed &quot;Prophecies&quot; in 1996, and &quot;Pornographic Messiah&quot; in 1998.

In 2000, Christian Death added drummer Will Sarginson and toured Europe with Britain&#x27;s Cradle of Filth in support of the &quot;Born Again Anti Christian&quot; studio album.

Kand and Maitri also formed another band, black metal and deathrock act Lover of Sin, releasing the studio album &quot;Christian Death Presents Lover of Sin&quot; in 2002.

For Christian Death&#x27;s 2003 tour, they were augmented by Cradle of Filth guitarist Gian Pyres.

Christian Death released &quot;American Inquisition&quot; in 2007, featuring new drummer Nate Hassan.

In 2014, the band embarked on the 30th Anniversary Catastrophe Ballet tour, beginning in Europe and continuing through the year&#x27;s end in North, South and Central America.

In January 2015, Christian Death announced the planned release of the PledgeMusic funded studio album, &quot;The Root of All Evilution&quot;. The album was digitally released on August 14, 2015, by Knife Fight Media, and on vinyl on October 16, 2015, by Season of Mist. A CD release was announced for December 18, 2015, on The End Records.

The band&#x27;s next studio album, titled &quot;Evil Becomes Rule&quot;, was released in May 2022.

John Albert, who had co-founded Christian Death with Williams, died on May 3, 2023.

==Musical style and content==
Christian Death&#x27;s style is considered gothic rock, deathrock and art punk. According to Steve Huey of AllMusic, Christian Death&#x27;s music &quot;relied on slow, doomy, effects-laden guitar riffs and ambient horror-soundtrack synths&quot;. According to Huey, Christian Death&#x27;s lyrics involve shock value and are often about topics like &quot;blasphemy, morbidity, drug use, and sexual perversity&quot;. Necrophilia also is a topic that has been used in Christian Death&#x27;s lyrics. Liz Ohanesian of &quot;LA Weekly&quot; wrote that Christian Death experiments &quot;with dirgey guitars, tribal drums and overtly spooky imagery&quot;. According to author Liisa Ladouceur, along with &quot;spooky guitars and keyboards&quot;, elements of genres such as post-punk and spoken word also have been used in Christian Death&#x27;s music.

==Legacy==
Artists that have been inspired by Christian Death include Celtic Frost, Tribulation, In Solitude, Tombs, Type O Negative, the 69 Eyes, Prayers, Marilyn Manson, Ghostemane, Greg Mackintosh of Paradise Lost, Perry Farrell of Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Aesop Dekker of Agalloch and Ludicra, Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and Jonathan Davis of Korn. The band&#x27;s bleak, anti-Christian aesthetic and lyrics were also particularly influential on the bands of black metal&#x27;s second wave.

<text>Johann Gottfried Jakob Hermann (28 November 1772 – 31 December 1848) was a German classical scholar and philologist. He published his works under the name Gottfried Hermann or its Latin equivalent .

==Biography==
He was born in Leipzig. Entering its university at the age of fourteen, Hermann at first studied law, which he soon abandoned for the classics. After a session at Jena in 1793–1794, he became a lecturer on classical literature in Leipzig, in 1798 professor extraordinarius of philosophy in the university, and in 1803 professor of eloquence (and poetry, 1809). His students included Leopold von Ranke. In 1840 in occasion of his 50th doctoral anniversary he received a medal. He died in Leipzig.

==Views==
Hermann maintained that an accurate knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages was the only road to a clear understanding of the intellectual life of the ancient world, and the chief, if not the only, aim of philology. As the leader of this grammatico-critical school, he came into collision with Philipp August Böckh and Karl Otfried Müller, the representatives of the historico-antiquarian school, which regarded Hermann&#x27;s view of philology as inadequate and one-sided.

==Works==
Hermann devoted his early attention to the classical poetical metres, and published several works on that subject, the most important being &quot;Elementa doctrinae metricae&quot; (1816), in which he set forth a scientific theory based on the Kantian categories. He also wrote a &quot;Handbuch der Metrik&quot; (1798). His writings on Greek grammar are also valuable, especially &quot;De emendanda ratione Graecae grammaticae&quot; (1801), and notes and excursus on François Viger&#x27;s treatise on Greek idioms. The principles of the new method he introduced are not only explicitly developed in &quot;De Emendenda Ratione Græcæ Grammaticæ&quot;, but are practically illustrated in his numerous editions of the ancient classics.

His editions of the classics include several of the plays of Euripides; the &quot;Clouds&quot; of Aristophanes (1799); &quot;Trinummus&quot; of Plautus (1800); &quot;Poëtica&quot; of Aristotle (1802); &quot;Orphica&quot;, a collection of works of Orphic literature (1805); the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; (1806); and the &quot;Lexicon&quot; of Photius (1808). In 1825 Hermann finished the edition of Sophocles begun by Erfurdt. His edition of Aeschylus was published after his death in 1852. The &quot;Opuscula&quot;, a collection of his smaller writings in Latin, appeared in seven volumes in Leipzig between 1827 and 1839. These show his power of dealing with chronological, topographical, and personal questions, and also contain some poems.

<text>Karl Otfried Müller (; 28 August 1797 – 1 August 1840) was a German professor, scholar of classical Greek studies and philodorian.

==Biography==

He was born at Brieg (modern Brzeg) in Silesia, then in the Kingdom of Prussia. His father was a chaplain in the Prussian army, and he was raised in the atmosphere of Protestant Pietism. He attended the gymnasium of his town. His university education was partly in Breslau (now Wrocław) and partly in Berlin. In Berlin, he was spurred towards the study of Greek literature, art and history by the influence of Philipp August Böckh. In 1817, after the publication of his first work, &quot;Aegineticorum liber&quot;, on the Aeginetans, he received an appointment at the Magdaleneum in Breslau, and in 1819 he was made adjunct professor of ancient literature at the University of Göttingen, his subject being the archaeology and history of ancient art. He deepened his understanding of Greek art by travelling in the summer of 1822 to the Netherlands, England and France.

Turning away from the Enlightenment conception of Greek myth as a reflection of a universal religion in its infancy, Müller placed the study squarely as the outcome of an encounter between the particular character of a people and a specific historical setting, where, in the broadest sense it has remained, though his convictions that the core of each culture is uniquely its own led him to deny the influence of Egyptian art on Greek art, already being recognised at the time.

Müller&#x27;s position at Göttingen was made difficult by the political troubles which followed the accession of Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover, in 1837, and he applied for permission to travel, leaving Germany in 1839. In April of the following year he reached Greece, having spent the winter in Italy. He investigated the remains of ancient Athens, visited numerous places in Peloponnesus, and finally went to Delphi, where he began excavations. He was attacked by intermittent fever, of which he died at Athens. His grave is on the Colonus hilltop in Athens next to that of Charles Lenormant. In 1841 a medal was struck in his honor.

==Works==

His aim was to form a vivid conception of Greek life as a whole. Undoubtedly he wished to concentrate the results of his whole life of scholarly activity in his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;Geschichten hellenischen Stämme und Städte&quot;. However, he only managed to complete two volumes: &quot;Orchomenos und die Minyer&quot; (1820) and &quot;Die Dorier&quot; (1824). The latter includes the essay &quot;Über die Makedonier&quot;, on the settlements, origin and early history of the Macedonians. He introduced a new standard of accuracy in the cartography of ancient Greece. In 1828 he published &quot;Die Etrusker&quot;, a treatise on Etruscan antiquities.

His &quot;Prolegomena zu einer wissenschaftlichen Mythologie&quot; (1825), in which he avoided the views of G. F. Creuzer and Christian August Lobeck, prepared the way for the scientific investigation of myths. Working without the benefit of modern understanding of psychology, he offered steps towards the &quot;internal idea&quot; of myth and presented techniques for determining the age of a &quot;mythus&quot; from the mentions of it in literary sources and a notable chapter on how to separate the &quot;mythus&quot; from the modifications of poets and prose writers, and examined the relations that Homer and Hesiod bore to their traditions, all of this before the supportive contributions of modern archaeology, philological analysis, or the understanding of oral transmission of myth, a remarkable achievement.

The study of ancient art was promoted by his &quot;Handbuch der Archäologie der Kunst&quot; (1830; 3d ed. by Welcker, 1848; English translation by J. Leitch, London, 1847) and &quot;Denkmäler der alten Kunst&quot; (1832), which he wrote in association with Carl Oesterley. In the former work, he coined the term &quot;pornographie&quot; (pornography) in German, which helped to popularize the term internationally. The latter work was continued and completed by Friedrich Wieseler (1846–56).

In the last years of his life, he undertook to prepare for the English Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, a history of Greek literature, which in 1841 appeared posthumously as &quot;Geschichte der griechischen Litteratur bis auf das Zeitalter Alexanders&quot; (4th edition, revised and continued by Heitz, 1882–84). It was translated into English from the author&#x27;s manuscript as &quot;History of the Literature of Ancient Greece&quot; and published the previous year in London. Chapters i.-xxii. were translated by Sir George Cornewall Lewis; chapters xxiii.-xxxvi. by J. W. Donaldson, who carried the work down to the taking of Constantinople by the Turks. It remained one of the best books on the subject for many years.

Müller also published an admirable translation of the &quot;Eumenides&quot; of Aeschylus with introductory essays (1833). This was the object of a profound controversy in which Gottfried Hermann and his followers attacked him with great bitterness. Müller published new editions of Varro, &quot;De Lingua Latina&quot; (Leipzig, 1833) and Festus, &quot;De Significatione Verborum&quot; (Leipzig, 1839).

<text>John William Donaldson (7 June 1811 – 10 February 1861) was an English academic and writer in Greek classics, a philologist and a biblical critic.

He was born in London, and was educated at University College, London, and Trinity College, Cambridge, of which he subsequently became a fellow. In 1841 he was elected headmaster of King Edward&#x27;s School, Bury St Edmunds, but, &quot;spectacularly unsuccessful&quot;, in 1855 he resigned his post and returned to Cambridge, where his time was divided between literary work and private tuition.

He is remembered as a pioneer of philology in the UK, though much of his work is now obsolete. The &quot;New Cratylus&quot; (1839), the book on which his fame mainly rests, was an attempt to apply to Greek the principles of comparative philology. The same year he was ordained deacon and in 1849 was graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge as a Doctor of Divinity. It was founded mainly on the comparative grammar of Franz Bopp, but a large part of it was original, Bopp&#x27;s grammar not being completed ten years after the first edition of the &quot;Cratylus&quot;. In Donaldson&#x27;s &quot;Varronianus&quot; (1844) the same method was applied to Latin, Umbrian and Oscan. He began a Greek dictionary, which was to have been the great work of his life and which he left unfinished apparently dying of mental stress of overwork, simultaneously being a tutor at Cambridge University and examiner at the University of London. When advised to take six months&#x27; rest he replied that this would cost him £1500. He spent his final four weeks moved to London however unable to conduct the students&#x27; examinations in his role as examiner.

==Personal life and headmastership==

Donaldson lost his fellowship in 1840 on his marriage to Eleanor Leathes Mortlock, nicknamed &quot;Laetitia&quot;, daughter of Sir John Cheetham Mortlock, banker at Cambridge. With Laetitia, Donaldson had two sons and two daughters. His first wife predeceased him, and he went on to marry Louisa, daughter of John Rawlins; they had three daughters. After taking pupils for a time at Winfrith in Dorset, in 1841 Donaldson was appointed headmaster of King Edward&#x27;s School, Bury St Edmunds, an appointment unfortunate for the institution and for himself. He was deficient in judgement and administrative power, and the school declined under him, notwithstanding his efforts to obtain reputation by the publication of Latin and Greek grammars, which met with little acceptance beyond the sphere of his personal influence and involved him in controversy. They were probably too scientific for school use, and his conviction of the defects of standard grammars had been expressed with indiscreet candour. He was active in the cultural life of Bury St Edmunds, where he greatly improved the Athenaeum.

==Book of Jashar==
Donaldson resigned the headmastership in 1855 partly on account of the outcry caused by the publication of &quot;Jashar; [subtitled:] fragmenta archetypa carminum Hebraicorum; collegit, ordinavit, restituit J. G. Donaldson&quot; at the end of 1854. In this extraordinary work he endeavoured to show that fragments of a book of Jashar are to be found throughout the Old Testament scriptures up to the time of Solomon, that the book was compiled in the reign of that monarch, and that its remains constitute ‘the religious marrow of the scriptures’. The work was heavily criticized and Donaldson&#x27;s religious orthodoxy was questioned. Although he defended his position in a vigorous pamphlet, he failed to convince his critics.

His &quot;Jashar&quot; (1854), written in Latin as an appeal to the learned world and especially to German theologians, was an attempt to reconstitute the lost biblical book of Jashar from the remains of old songs and historical records, which, according to the author, are incorporated in the existing text of the Old Testament. His bold views on the nature of inspiration, and his free handling of the sacred text, aroused the anger of the theologians and Donaldson&#x27;s religious orthodoxy was questioned.

Of his many other works, most important are:
*&quot;The Theatre of the Greeks; The History of the Literature of Ancient Greece&quot; (a translation and completion of Karl Otfried Müller&#x27;s unfinished work) with P.W. Buckham
*The &quot;Odes&quot; of Pindar (his edition)
*&quot;Antigone&quot; of Sophocles (his edition)
*A Hebrew, a Greek and a Latin grammar.

<doc id="200328" wikidata="Q991701" url="?curid=200328" title="Piano Sonata No. 16 (Mozart)">
<text>The Piano Sonata No. 16 in C major, K. 545, by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was described by Mozart in his own thematic catalogue as &quot;for beginners&quot;, and it is very commonly known by the nickname Sonata facile or Sonata semplice.

Mozart added the work to his catalogue on June 26, 1788, the same date as his Symphony No. 39. The exact circumstances of the work&#x27;s composition are not known. Although the piece is well known today, it was not published in Mozart&#x27;s lifetime and first appeared in print in 1805. A typical performance takes about 11 minutes.

==The music==
The work has three movements:
===I. &quot;Allegro&quot;===

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \new PianoStaff { «
\new Staff \relative c&quot; { \key c \major \tempo &quot;Allegro&quot; \tempo 4 = 140 \time 4/4 c2( e4) g b,4.( c16 d c4) r4 a&#x27;2( g4) c g( f8\trill e16 f e4) r4 }
\new Staff \relative c&#x27; { c8 g&#x27; e g c, g&#x27; e g d g f g c, g&#x27; e g c, a&#x27; f a c, g&#x27; e g b, g&#x27; d g c, g&#x27; e g }
}
&lt;/score&gt;
The first movement is written in sonata form and is in the key of C major. The familiar opening theme is accompanied by an Alberti bass, played in the left hand.

A bridge passage composed of scales follows, arriving at a cadence in G major, the key in which the second theme is then played. A codetta follows to conclude the exposition, then the exposition is repeated. The development starts in G minor and modulates through several keys. The recapitulation begins, unusually, in the subdominant key of F major. The Alberti bass that began as a C major triad at this point becomes an F major triad, followed by a left hand F major scale pattern which emulates the rhythm of the previous right hand A minor scale.

According to Charles Rosen, the practice of beginning a recapitulation in the subdominant was &quot;rare at the time [the sonata] was written&quot;, though the practice was later taken up by Franz Schubert.

===II. &quot;Andante&quot;===

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; \new PianoStaff { «
\new Staff { \key g \major \tempo &quot;Andante&quot; \time 3/4 b2\p_\markup { \italic dolce } ( d16 c b c d8. b16 g4 ) r4 g&#x27;4. ( a16 g fis e d cis d8. b16 g4 ) }
\new Staff \relative c&#x27; { \clef &quot;bass&quot; \key g \major g16_\markup { \italic legato } d&#x27; b d g, d&#x27; b d a d b d g, d&#x27; b d g, d&#x27; b d g, d&#x27; b d g, e&#x27; c e g, e&#x27; c e g, cis ais cis g d&#x27; b d g, d&#x27; b d }
}
&lt;/score&gt;

The second movement is in the key of G major, the dominant key of C major. The music modulates to the dominant key of D major, and then back to G major in which the exposition is heard again. For the development, the music modulates to G minor, then B major, then C minor, then G minor and finally back to G major, at which point the recapitulation occurs followed by a short coda.

===III. &quot;Rondo: Allegretto&quot;===
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; \new PianoStaff { «
\new Staff { \key c \major \mark &quot;Rondo&quot; \tempo &quot;Allegretto&quot; \time 2/4 \partial 4 &lt;e g&gt;8-.\mf &lt;e g&gt;8-. | &lt;c e&gt;8-. r8 &lt;d f&gt;8-. &lt;d f&gt;8-. | 8-. r8 c16\p ( d e c | a b c cis d e f d | \override Stem.direction = #DOWN c! b a g ) }
\new Staff \relative c&#x27; { \clef &quot;bass&quot; r4 &lt;a c&gt;8-. &lt;a c&gt;8-. &lt;f a&gt;8-. r8 &lt;g b&gt;8-. &lt;g b&gt;8-. &lt;e g&gt;8-. r8 f4. ( d8 g8 ) r8 }
}
&lt;/score&gt;

The third movement is in Rondo form and is in the tonic key, C major. The first theme is lively and sets the mood of the piece. The second theme is in G major and contains an Alberti bass in the left hand. The first theme appears again and is followed by a third theme. The third theme is in a minor key and modulates through many different keys before modulating into C major. The first theme appears again followed by a coda and finally ends in C major.

The finale was transposed to F major and combined with a solo piano arrangement of the second movement of the violin sonata in F major to form the posthumously compiled and thus spurious Piano Sonata in F major, K. 547a.

==Other arrangements==

In 1876–1877, Edvard Grieg arranged this sonata for two pianos, by adding further accompaniment on the second piano part, whilst the first piano part plays the original as Mozart wrote it. Grieg&#x27;s intent was to &quot;impart to several of Mozart&#x27;s sonatas a tonal effect appealing to our modern ears&quot;. 

The jazz musician Raymond Scott adapted the opening theme of the first movement for his piece &quot;In an Eighteenth Century Drawing Room&quot;.

<doc id="200329" wikidata="Q544314" url="?curid=200329" title="Charles Webster Leadbeater">
<text>Charles Webster Leadbeater (; 16 February 1854 – 1 March 1934) was a member of the Theosophical Society, Co-Freemasonry, an author on occult subjects, and the co-initiator, with J. I. Wedgwood, of the Liberal Catholic Church.

Originally a priest of the Church of England, his interest in spiritualism caused him to end his affiliation with Anglicanism in favour of the Theosophical Society, where he became an associate of Annie Besant. He became a high-ranking officer of the Society and remained one of its leading members until his death in 1934, writing over 60 books and pamphlets and maintaining regular speaking engagements.

==Early life==
Leadbeater was born in Stockport, Cheshire, in 1854. His father, Charles, was born in Lincoln and his mother Emma was born in Liverpool. He was an only child. By 1861, the family had relocated to London, where his father was a railway contractor&#x27;s clerk.

In 1862, when Leadbeater was eight years old, his father died from tuberculosis. Four years later a bank in which the family&#x27;s savings were invested became bankrupt. Without finances for college, Leadbeater sought work soon after graduating from high school in order to provide for his mother and himself. He worked at various clerical jobs. During the evenings he became largely self-educated. For example, he studied astronomy and had a 12-inch reflector telescope (which was very expensive at the time) to observe the heavens at night. He also studied French, Latin and Greek.

An uncle, his father&#x27;s brother-in-law, was the well-known Anglican cleric William Wolfe Capes. By his uncle&#x27;s influence, Leadbeater was ordained an Anglican priest in 1879 in Farnham by the Bishop of Winchester. By 1881, he was living with his widowed mother at Bramshott in a cottage which his uncle had built, where he is listed as &quot;Curate of Bramshott&quot;. He was an active priest and teacher who was remembered later as &quot;a bright and cheerful and kindhearted man&quot;. About this time, after reading about the séances of reputed medium Daniel Dunglas Home (1833–1886), Leadbeater developed an active interest in spiritualism.

==Theosophical Society==
His interest in Theosophy was stimulated by A. P. Sinnett&#x27;s &quot;Occult World&quot;, and he joined the Theosophical Society in 1883. The next year he met Helena Petrovna Blavatsky when she came to London; she accepted him as a pupil and he became a vegetarian.

Around this time he wrote a letter to Kuthumi, asking to be accepted as his pupil. Shortly afterward, an encouraging response influenced him to go to India; he arrived at Adyar in 1884. He wrote that while in India, he had received visits and training from some of the &quot;Masters&quot; that according to Blavatsky were the inspiration behind the formation of the Theosophical Society, and were its hidden guides. This was the start of a long career with the Theosophical Society.

==Headmaster in Ceylon==
During 1885, Leadbeater traveled with Henry Steel Olcott (1832–1907), first President of the Theosophical Society, to Burma and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). In Ceylon they founded the English Buddhist Academy, with Leadbeater staying there to serve as its first headmaster under very austere conditions. This school gradually expanded to become Ananda College, which now has more than 6,000 students and has a building named for Leadbeater. After Blavatsky left Adyar in 1886 to return to Europe and finish writing &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot;, Leadbeater claimed to have developed clairvoyant abilities.

==Return to England==
In 1889, Sinnett asked Leadbeater to return to England to tutor his son and George Arundale (1878–1945). He agreed and brought with him one of his pupils, Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa (1875–1953). Although struggling with poverty himself, Leadbeater managed to send both Arundale and Jinarajadasa to Cambridge University. Both would eventually serve as International presidents of the Theosophical Society.

==Meeting with Annie Besant==
After H. P. Blavatsky&#x27;s death in 1891, Annie Besant, an English social activist, took over leadership of the Theosophical Society along with Colonel Olcott. Besant met Leadbeater in 1894. The next year she invited him to live at the London Theosophical Headquarters, where H.P. Blavatsky died in 1891.

==Writing and speaking career==
Leadbeater wrote over 60 books and pamphlets during the period from 1895 to his death in 1934, many of which continued to be published until 1955. Two noteworthy titles, &quot;Astral Plane&quot; and the &quot;Devachanic Plane (or The Heaven World)&quot; both of which contained writings on the realms the soul passes through after death.

&quot;For the first time among occultists, a detailed investigation had been made of the &quot;Astral Plane&quot; as a whole, in a manner similar to that in which a botanist in an Amazonian jungle would set to work in order to classify its trees, plants and shrubs, and so write a botanical history of the jungle. For this reason the little book, The Astral Plane, was definitely a landmark, and the Master as Keeper of the Records desired to place its manuscript in the great Museum.&quot;

Highlights of his writing career included addressing topics such as: the existence of a loving God, The Masters of Wisdom, what happens after death, immortality of the human soul, reincarnation, Karma or the Law of Consequence, development of clairvoyant abilities, the nature of thought forms, dreams, vegetarianism, Esoteric Christianity

He also became one of the best known speakers of the Theosophical Society for a number of years and served as Secretary of the London Lodge.

=== &quot;Clairvoyance&quot; ===

&quot;Clairvoyance&quot; is a book by Leadbeater originally published in 1899 in London. It is a study of a belief in seeing beyond the realms of ordinary sight. The author mainly appeals readers &quot;convinced of the existence of clairvoyance and familiar with theosophical terms.&quot; Leadbeater claims that the &quot;power to see what is hidden from ordinary physical sight&quot; is an extension of common reception, and &quot;describes a wide range of phenomena.&quot;

===Methods of development===
Leadbeater writes about the importance of control over thinking and the need for skill &quot;to concentrate thought&quot;:
&quot;Let a man choose a certain time every day—a time when he can rely upon being quiet and undisturbed, though preferably in the daytime rather than at night—and set himself at that time to keep his mind for a few minutes entirely free from all earthly thoughts of any kind whatever and, when that is achieved, to direct the whole force of his being towards the highest spiritual ideal that he happens to know. He will find that to gain such perfect control of thought is enormously more difficult than he supposes, but when he attains it, it cannot but be in every way most beneficial to him, and as he grows more and more able to elevate and concentrate his thought, he may gradually find that new worlds are opening before his sight.&quot;
===Author&#x27;s personal experience===

Professor Robert Ellwood wrote that from 1884 to 1888 Leadbeater undertook a course of meditation practice &quot;which awakened his clairvoyance.&quot; One day when the Master Kuthumi visited, he asked whether Leadbeater had ever attempted &quot;a certain kind of meditation connected with the development of the mysterious power called &quot;kundalini&quot;.&quot; The Master recommended him to make a &quot;few efforts along certain lines,&quot; and told him that he would himself &quot;watch over those efforts to see that no danger should ensue.&quot; Leadbeater accepted the offer of the Master and became &quot;day after day&quot; working on this kind of meditation. He worked on the task assigned to him for forty-two days, and it seemed to him that he was already on the verge of achieving a result when Kuthumi intervened and &quot;performed the final act of breaking through which completed the process,&quot; and enabled Leadbeater thereafter to use astral sight while as he was retaining full consciousness in the physical body. It is equivalent to saying that &quot;the astral consciousness and memory became continuous,&quot; whether the physical body was awake or asleep.

===Possible application===
In the chapter &quot;Simple Clairvoyance: Full&quot; the author argues that an occultist-clairvoyant can &quot;see&quot; the smallest particles of matter, for example, a molecule or atom, magnifying them &quot;as though by a microscope.&quot; In the chapter &quot;Clairvoyance in Time: The Past&quot; Leadbeater claims that before the historian who is in &quot;full possession of this power&quot; open up wonderful possibilities:
&quot;He has before him a field of historical research of most entrancing interest. Not only can he review at his leisure all history with which we are acquainted, correcting as he examines it the many errors and misconceptions which have crept into the accounts handed down to us; he can also range at will over the whole story of the world from its very beginning.&quot;

===New editions and translations===
The book was reprinted several times and translated into some European languages. Second edition of the book was published in 1903, and third—in 1908.

==Resignation from the Theosophical Society==
In 1906, critics were angered to learn that Leadbeater had given advice to boys under his care that encouraged masturbation as a way to relieve obsessive sexual thoughts. Leadbeater acknowledged that he had given this advice to a few boys approaching maturity who came to him for help. He commented, &quot;I know that the whole question of sex feelings is the principal difficulty in the path of boys and girls, and very much harm is done by the prevalent habit of ignoring the subject and fearing to speak of it to young people. The first information about it should come from parents or friends, not from servants or bad companions.&quot;

The revelations regarding Leadbeater&#x27;s advice prompted several members of the Theosophical Society to ask for his resignation. The Society held proceedings against him in 1906. Annie Besant, elected president of the Society in 1907, later stated in his defense:
:&quot;The so-called trial of Mr Leadbeater was a travesty of justice. He came before Judges, one of whom had declared before hand that &#x27;he ought to be shot&#x27;; another, before hearing him, had written passionate denunciations of him, a third and fourth had accepted, on purely psychic testimony, unsupported by any evidence, the view that he was grossly immoral, and a danger to the Society...&quot;

Charges of misconduct that went beyond the advice he admitted giving were never proven. He nevertheless resigned.

==Readmission to the Theosophical Society==
After Olcott died in 1907, Annie Besant became president of the society following a political struggle. By the end of 1908, the International Sections voted for Leadbeater&#x27;s readmission. He accepted and came to Adyar on 10 February 1909. At the time, Besant referred to Leadbeater as a martyr who was wronged by her and by the Theosophical Society, saying that &quot;never again would a shadow come between her and her brother Initiate&quot;.

==Discovery of Krishnamurti==
In 1909 Leadbeater encountered fourteen-year-old Jiddu Krishnamurti at the private beach of the Theosophical Society headquarters at Adyar. Krishnamurti&#x27;s family lived next to the compound; his father, a long-time Theosophist, was employed by the Society. Leadbeater believed Krishnamurti to be a suitable candidate for the &quot;vehicle&quot; of the World Teacher, a reputed messianic entity whose imminent appearance he and many Theosophists were expecting. The proclaimed savior would then usher in a new age and religion.

Leadbeater assigned the pseudonym &quot;Alcyone&quot; to Krishnamurti and under the title &quot;Rents in the Veil of Time&quot;, he published 30 reputed past lives of Alcyone in a series in &quot;The Theosophist&quot; magazine beginning in April 1910. &quot;They ranged from 22,662 BC to 624 AD ... Alcyone was a female in eleven of them.&quot;

Leadbeater stayed in India until 1915, overseeing the education of Krishnamurti; he then relocated to Australia. During the late 1920s, Krishnamurti disavowed the role that Leadbeater and other Theosophists expected him to fulfil. He disassociated himself from the Theosophical Society and its doctrines and practices, and during the next six decades became known as an influential speaker on philosophical and religious subjects.

==Australia and &quot;The Science of the Sacraments&quot;==
In 1915 Leadbeater moved to Sydney, where he laid the foundation-stone of the Theosophical Hall, &quot;King&#x27;s Hall&quot; on Hunter Street. He was responsible for the construction of the Star Amphitheatre at Balmoral Beach in 1924. While in Australia he became acquainted with J. I. Wedgwood, a Theosophist and bishop in the Liberal Catholic Church who initiated him into Co-Masonry in 1915 and later consecrated him as a bishop of the Liberal Catholic Church in 1916.

Public interest in Theosophy in Australia and New Zealand increased greatly as a result of Leadbeater&#x27;s presence there and Sydney became comparable to Adyar as a centre of Theosophical activity. 

In 1922, the Theosophical Society began renting a mansion known as The Manor in the Sydney suburb of Mosman. Leadbeater took up residence there as the director of a community of Theosophists. The Manor became a major site and was regarded as &quot;the greatest of occult forcing houses&quot;. There he accepted young women students. They included Clara Codd, future President of the Theosophical Society in America, clairvoyant Dora van Gelder, another future President of the Theosophical Society in America who during the 1970s also worked with Delores Krieger to develop the technique of Therapeutic touch, and Mary Lutyens, who would later write an authorized Krishnamurti biography. Lutyens stayed there in 1925, while Krishnamurti and his brother Nitya stayed at another house nearby. The Manor became one of three major Theosophical Society sites, the others being at Adyar and the Netherlands. The Theosophical Society bought The Manor in 1925 and during 1951 created The Manor Foundation Ltd, to own and administer the house, which is still used by the Society.

It was also during his stay in Australia that Leadbeater became the Presiding Bishop of the Liberal Catholic Church and co-wrote the liturgy book for the church which is still in use today. The work represents an adaptation of the Roman Catholic liturgy of his time, for which Leadbeater sought to remove what he regarded as undesirable elements, such as (in his view) the blatant anthropomorphisms and expressions of the fear and wrath of God, which he regarded &quot;as derogatory alike to the idea of a loving Father and to the men He has created in His own image.&quot;

&quot;If Christians&quot;, he wrote, &quot;had been content to take what Christ taught of the Father in heaven, they would never have saddled themselves with the jealous, angry, bloodthirsty Jehovah of Ezra, Nehemiah and the others – a god that needs propitiating and to whose &#x27;mercy&#x27; constant appeals must be made.&quot;

Thus the Credo of the Liberal Catholic Church liturgy for the shorter form of Holy Eucharist written by Leadbeater reads:
:&quot;We believe that God is Love, and Power, and Truth, and Light; that perfect justice rules the world: that all His sons shall one day reach His Feet, however far they stray. We hold the Fatherhood of God, the Brotherhood of man; we know that we do serve Him best when best we serve our brother man. So shall His blessing rest on us, + and peace for evermore. Amen.&quot;

Previously, Leadbeater had written on the energies of the Christian sacraments in &quot;The Science of the Sacraments: An Occult and Clairvoyant Study of the Christian Eucharist&quot;, one of the most significant works of Christian esotericism. In his prologue to the latest edition of this book, John Kersey refers to the Eucharist proposed by Leadbeater as &quot;a radical reinterpretation of the context of the Eucharist seen within a theological standpoint of esoteric magic and universal salvation; it is Catholicism expressing the love of God to the full without the burdens of needless guilt and fear, and the false totem of the temporal powers of the church.&quot;

== &quot;How Theosophy Came to Me&quot; ==
It is an autobiographical book by Leadbeater; it was first published in 1930.

Spiritualism and Theosophy
Leadbeater tells that he was interested always in a variety of anomal phenomena, and if in any newspaper report it was said about the appearance of ghosts or other curious events in the troubled house, he had been going immediately to this location. In a large number of instances it was a blank — &quot;either there was no evidence worth mentioning, or the ghost declined to appear when he was wanted.&quot; Sometimes, however, there were signs of some success, and soon he had collected &quot;an amount of direct evidence&quot; that could easily convince him.

In attitude to spiritualism Leadbeater was initially set up quite skeptical, but still one day decided to conduct an experiment with his mother and a some small boy, who, as they later discovered, &quot;was a powerful physical medium.&quot; They had a small round table with a leg in the middle and silk hat, which they put on the table, and then put their &quot;hands upon its brim as prescribed.&quot; Surprisingly the hat gave &quot;a gentle but decided half-turn on the polished surface of the table,&quot; and then began to spin so vigorously that it was difficult to keep on it their hands.Further, the author describes the events as follows:
&quot;Here was my own familiar silk hat, which I had never before suspected of any occult qualities, suspending itself mysteriously in the air from the tips of our fingers, and, not content with that defiance of the laws of gravity on its own account, attaching a table to its crown and lifting that also! I looked down to the feet of the table; they were about six inches from the carpet, and no human foot was touching them or near them! I passed my own foot underneath, but there was certainly nothing there—nothing physically perceptible, at any rate.&quot;
The author says that he was not himself thinking of the phenomenon &quot;in the least as a manifestation from the dead,&quot; but only as the disclosure of some unknown new force.

Leadbeater says that the first theosophical book that fell into his hands was Sinnett&#x27;s &quot;The Occult World.&quot; Histories contained in this book were for him very interested, but &quot;its real fascination lay in the glimpses which it gave of a wonderful system of philosophy and of a kind of inner science which really seemed to explain life rationally and to account for many phenomena,&quot; which Leadbeater has watched. He had written to Sinnett, who invited him to come to London in order to meet. The author tells that when he had claimed of joining the Society, Sinnett &quot;became very grave and opined that that would hardly do,&quot; since Leadbeater was a clergyman. He had asked him why the Society discriminates against members according to the cloth. Sinnett replied: &quot;Well, you see, we are in the habit of discussing every subject and every belief from the beginning, without any preconceptions whatever; and I am afraid that at our meetings you would be likely to hear a great deal that would shock you profoundly.&quot;
But most members of the Council of the London Lodge approved the joining of Leadbeater. He was joined into the Theosophical Society together with professor Crookes and his wife. On that day at the Lodge meeting &quot;have been some two hundred people present,&quot; including such as professor Myers, Stainton Moses and others.

Blavatsky

In a section &quot;I Meet Our Founder&quot; Leadbeater describes the &quot;triumphant&quot; appearance of Blavatsky at a meeting of the London Lodge of the British Theosophical Society, where he saw her for the first time.
&quot;Suddenly and sharply the door opposite to us opened, and a stout lady in black came quickly in and seated herself at the outer end of our bench. She sat listening to the wrangling on the platform for a few minutes, and then began to exhibit distinct signs of impatience. As there seemed to be no improvement in sight, she then jumped up from her seat, shouted in a tone of military command the one word &#x27;Mohini!&#x27; and then walked straight out of the door into the passage. The stately and dignified Mohini came rushing down that long room at his highest speed, and as soon as he reached the passage threw himself incontinently flat on his face on the floor at the feet of the lady in black. Many people arose in confusion, not knowing what was happening; but a moment later Mr. Sinnett himself also came running to the door, went out and exchanged a few words, and then, re-entering the room, he stood up on the end of our bench and spoke in a ringing voice the fateful words: &#x27;Let me introduce to the London Lodge as a whole—Madame Blavatsky!&#x27; The scene was indescribable; the members, wildly delighted and yet half-awed at the same time, clustered round our great Founder, some kissing her hand, several kneeling before her, and two or three weeping hysterically.&quot;
According to the author, the impression which Blavatsky made &quot;was indescribable.&quot; She was looking straight through man, and obviously saw everything that was in one, and not everyone liked it. Sometimes Leadbeater heard from her very unpleasant revelations about those with whom she spoke. He&#x27;s writing: &quot;Prodigious force was the first impression, and perhaps courage, outspokenness, and straightforwardness were the second.&quot;

Leadbeater writes that Blavatsky was the best interlocutor he had ever met: &quot;She had the most wonderful gift for repartee; she had it almost to excess, perhaps.&quot; She also had knowledge of all sorts of things that relate to very different directions. She always had something to say, and it was never empty talk. She traveled a lot, and mostly on little-known places, and did not forget anything. She remembered even the most insignificant cases that had happened to her. She was a wonderful storyteller, who knew how to give a good story and make the right impression. &quot;Whatever else she may have been, she was never commonplace. She always had something new, striking, interesting, unusual to tell us.&quot;

In connection with the accusations of Blavatsky&#x27;s enemies in her alleged fraud, cheating, forgery, Leadbeater writes: &quot;The very idea of deception of any sort in connection with Madame Blavatsky is unthinkable to anyone who knew her... Her absolute genuineness was one of the most prominent features of her marvellously complex character.&quot;

Letters from Kuthumi

The author tells that during the study of spiritualism his greatest confidant was medium William Eglinton. On one of the spiritualistic séances Eglinton&#x27;s spirit guide &quot;Ernest&quot; agreed to take Leadbeater&#x27;s letter in order to transmit it to the Master Kuthumi. In this letter the author &quot;with all reverence&quot; wrote that ever since he had first heard of theosophy his one desire had been to place himself under Master as a chela (pupil). He also wrote about his current circumstances and asked whether a pupil needed to be in India for seven years of probation.

The response from the Master Kuthumi arrived a few months later. The mahatma said that to be in India for seven years of probation wasn&#x27;t necessary—a chela could pass them anywhere. He offered to let Leadbeater work at Adyar for a few months to see if he could be a servant at headquarters, and added a significant remark: &quot;He who would shorten the years of probation has to make sacrifices for theosophy.&quot;The letter was ended with the following words:
&quot;You ask me — &#x27;what rules I must observe during this time of probation, and how soon I might venture to hope that it could begin&#x27;. I answer: you &quot;have&quot; the making of your own future, in your own hands as shown above, and every day you may be weaving its woof. If I were to &quot;demand&quot; that you should do one thing or the other, instead of simply advising, I would be responsible for every effect that might flow from the step and you acquire but a secondary merit. Think, and you will see that this is true. So cast the lot yourself into the lap of Justice, never fearing but that its response will be absolutely true.

Chelaship is an educational as well as probationary stage and the chela alone can determine whether it shall end in adeptship or failure. Chelas from a mistaken idea of our system too often watch and wait for orders, wasting precious time which should be taken up with personal effort. Our cause needs missionaries, devotees, agents, even martyrs perhaps. But it cannot demand of any man to make himself either. So now choose and grasp your own destiny, and may our Lord&#x27;s the Tathâgata&#x27;s memory aid you to decide for the best.&quot;

After reading the letter, Leadbeater hurried back to London, not doubting his decision to devote his life to the service for the Masters. He hoped to send his answer with the help of Blavatsky. At first she refused to read the letter of the mahatma, saying that such cases are purely private, but as a result of Leadbeater&#x27;s insistence, she finally read and asked him what answer he had decided to give. He said he wanted to quit his priesthood career and go to India, fully dedicating himself to a serving the Masters. Blavatsky assured him that, because of her constant connection with the mahatma, he already knows about Leadbeater&#x27;s decision, and will give his answer in the near time. She warned that he need to stay close to her until he get an answer. The author tells:
&quot;She (Blavatky) was talking brilliantly to those who were present, and rolling one of her eternal cigarettes, when suddenly her right hand was jerked out towards the fire in a very peculiar fashion, and lay palm upwards. She looked down at it in surprise, as I did myself, for I was standing close to her, leaning with an elbow on the mantel-piece: and several of us saw quite clearly a sort of whitish mist form in the palm of her hand and then condense into a piece of folded paper, which she at once handed to me, saying: &#x27;There is your answer&#x27;.&quot;
It was a very short note, and read it as follows:
&quot;Since your intuition led you in the right direction and made you understand that it was &quot;my desire&quot; you should go to Adyar &quot;immediately&quot;, I may say more. The sooner you go the better. Do not lose one day more than you can help. Sail on the 5th if possible. Join Upasika at Alexandria. Let no one know that you are going, and may the blessing of our Lord and my poor blessing shield you from every evil in your new life. Greeting to you, &quot;my new chela.&quot;
−K.H.&quot;

In section &quot;A Message&quot; the author tells how Blavatsky received in the going train car from the mahatma Kuthumi a note, which had several words intended for him: &quot;Tell Leadbeater that I am satisfied with his zeal and devotion.&quot;

Leadbeater claims that in early days of the Theosophical Society commissions and orders from the mahatmas were common, and members lived at a &quot;level of splendid enthusiasm which those who have joined since Madame Blavatsky&#x27;s death can hardly imagine.&quot;

Tisarana and pansil

During the few weeks of traveling from Egypt to India, Blavatsky radically transformed the personality of Leadbeater, who was &quot;an ordinary lawn-tennis-playing curate—well-meaning and conscientious... incredibly shy and retiring,&quot; making him a worthy disciple of mahatmas.

During a brief stop in Ceylon, Blavatsky who together with Olcott even earlier became a Buddhist invited Leadbeater to follow the example of the founders of the Theosophical Society. The author writes that she believed that since he was a Christian priest, his public demonstration of Buddhism could convince both Hindus and Buddhists of the honesty of his intentions and would allow him to become more useful for the mahatmas.After three times pronouncing of a praise to the Lord Buddha: &quot;I reverence the Blessed One, the Holy One, the Perfect in Wisdom,&quot; Leadbeater recitated on the Pali sacred formula of the Tisarana and then the Pancha Sila.

Upon arrival in Madras, Blavatsky has spoken in front of the Hindustanies who filled the room, indignant at the actions of the Christian missionaries.
&quot;When at last she was allowed to speak, she began very well by saying how touched she was by this enthusiastic reception, and how it showed her what she had always known, that the people of India would not accept tamely these vile, cowardly, loathsome and utterly abominable slanders, circulated by these unspeakable—but here she became so vigorously adjectival that the Colonel hurriedly intervened, and somehow persuaded her to resume her seat, while he called upon an Indian member to offer a few remarks.&quot;
The author informs that his life at Adyar was ascetic; there were practically no servants, except two gardeners and a boy who has been working in the office. Leadbeater ate every day porridge from wheat flakes, which he brewed himself, also he was being brought milk and bananas. At the headquarters of the Society, Leadbeater had been taking post of the recording secretary, since that allowed him to remain in the center of the Theosophical movement, where, as he knew, in the materialized forms, the Masters were often shown themselves.

One day the author had met with the mahatma Kuthumi on the roof of the headquarters, next to Blavatsky&#x27;s room. He was near a balustrade which &quot;running along the front of the house at the edge of the roof&quot; when the Master &quot;materialized&quot;, stepping over the balustrade, as if before that he had been flying through the air. Leadbeater says:
&quot;Naturally I rushed forward and prostrated myself before Him; He raised me with a kindly smile, saying that though such demonstrations of reverence were the custom among the Indian peoples, He did not expect them from His European devotees, and He thought that perhaps there would be less possibility of any feeling of embarrassment if each nation confined itself to its own methods of salutation.&quot;

Occult training

The author claims that when he arrived in India, he did not have any clairvoyant abilities. One day when Kuthumi &quot;honoured&quot; him with a visit, he asked whether Leadbeater had ever attempted &quot;a certain kind of meditation connected with the development of the mysterious power called &quot;kundalini&quot;.&quot; Leadbeater had heard of that power, but thinked it to be certainly out of reach for Western people. Yet Kuthumi recommended him to make a &quot;few efforts along certain lines,&quot; and told him that he would himself &quot;watch over those efforts to see that no danger should ensue.&quot; He accepted the offer of the Master and became &quot;day after day&quot; working on this kind of meditation. He was told that on average it would take forty days, if he do it constantly and vigorously.

Leadbeater worked on the task assigned to him for forty-two days, and it seemed to him that he was already on the verge of achieving a result when Kuthumi intervened and &quot;performed the final act of breaking through which completed the process,&quot; and enabled the author thereafter to use astral sight while as he was retaining full consciousness in the physical body. It is equivalent to saying that &quot;the astral consciousness and memory became continuous,&quot; whether the physical body was awake or asleep.

A lot of care and work was spent on occult training of the author by the Master Djwal Khul. Leadbeater tells:
&quot;Over and over again He would make a vivid thought-form, and say to me: &#x27;What do you see?&#x27; And when I described it to the best of my ability, would come again and again the comment: &#x27;No, no, you are not seeing true; you are not seeing all; dig deeper into yourself, use your mental vision as well as your astral; press just a little further, a little higher.&#x27;&quot;
To participate in the training of Leadbeater, often came to headquarters swami Subba Row, &quot;our great pandit&quot;, as the author calls him. And Leadbeater claims that he will forever remain an obligor to these &quot;two great people&quot; — Djwal Khul and Subba Row – for all the help which they gave him &quot;at this critical stage&quot; of his life.

==Allegations of pederasty==

Leadbeater&#x27;s career was accompanied by repeated allegations of improper sexual relationships with children. He was defrocked from the Church of England due to his interest in spiritualism. He was temporarily expelled from the Theosophical Society for pedophilia, but reinstated due to lack of evidence. Leadbeater was later reinstated in the Theosophical Society, and none of these sexual allegations were ever substantiated.
