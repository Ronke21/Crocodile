<text>Henry Harley &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold (25 June 1886 – 15 January 1950) was an American general officer holding the ranks of General of the Army and later, General of the Air Force. Arnold was an aviation pioneer, Chief of the Air Corps (1938–1941), commanding general of the United States Army Air Forces, the only United States Air Force general to hold five-star rank, and the only officer to hold a five-star rank in two different U.S. military services. Arnold was also the founder of Project RAND, which evolved into one of the world&#x27;s largest non-profit global policy think tanks, the RAND Corporation, and was one of the founders of Pan American World Airways.

Instructed in flying by the Wright Brothers, Arnold was one of the first military pilots worldwide, and one of the first three rated pilots in the history of the United States Air Force. He overcame a fear of flying that resulted from his experiences with early flight, supervised the expansion of the Air Service during World War I, and became a protégé of then Brigadier General (later Colonel) Billy Mitchell.

Arnold rose to command the Army Air Forces immediately prior to the American entry into World War II and directed its hundred-fold expansion from an organization of little more than 20,000 men and 800 first-line combat aircraft into the largest and most powerful air force in the world. An advocate of technological research and development, his tenure saw the development of the intercontinental bomber, the jet fighter, the extensive use of radar, global airlift and atomic warfare as mainstays of modern air power.

Arnold&#x27;s most widely used nickname, &quot;Hap&quot;, was short for &quot;Happy&quot;, attributed variously to work associates when he as a silent film stunt pilot in October 1911, or to his wife, who began using the nickname in her correspondence in 1931 following the death of Arnold&#x27;s mother. His family called him Harley during his youth, and his mother and wife called him &quot;Sunny&quot;. His West Point classmates called Arnold &quot;Pewt&quot; or &quot;Benny&quot; and his immediate subordinates and headquarters staff referred to him as &quot;The Chief&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Born 25 June 1886, in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, Arnold was the son of Dr. Herbert Alonzo Arnold (1857–1933), a physician and a member of the prominent political and military Arnold Family. His mother was Anna Louise (&quot;Gangy&quot;) Harley (1857–1931), from a &quot;Dunker&quot; farm family and the first female in her family to attend high school. Arnold was Baptist in religious belief but had strong Mennonite ties through both families. However, unlike her husband, &quot;Gangy&quot; Arnold was &quot;fun-loving and prone to laughter,&quot; and not rigid in her beliefs. When Arnold was eleven, his father responded to the Spanish–American War by serving as a surgeon in the Pennsylvania National Guard, of which he remained a member for the next 24 years.

Arnold attended Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1903. The athletic fields at Lower Merion are named after him. Arnold had no intention of attending West Point (he was preparing to attend Bucknell University and enter the Baptist ministry) but took the entrance examination after his older brother Thomas defied their father and refused to do so. Arnold placed second on the list and received a delayed appointment when the nominated cadet confessed to being married, prohibited by academy regulations.

Arnold entered the United States Military Academy at West Point as a &quot;Juliette&quot; (one month late), having just turned 17. His cadet career was spent as a &quot;clean sleeve&quot; (cadet private). At the academy he helped found the &quot;Black Hand&quot;, a group of cadet pranksters, and led it during his first class year. He played second-team running back for the varsity football team, was a shot putter on the track and field team, and excelled at polo. Arnold&#x27;s academic standing varied between the middle and the lower end of his class, with his better scores in mathematics and science. He wanted assignment to the Cavalry but an inconsistent demerit record and a cumulative general merit class standing of 66th out of 111 cadets resulted in his being commissioned on 24 June 1907, as a second lieutenant, Infantry. He initially protested the assignment (there was no commissioning requirement for USMA graduates in 1907), but was persuaded to accept a commission in the 29th Infantry, at the time stationed in the Philippines. Arnold arrived in Manila on 7 December 1907.

Arnold disliked infantry troop duties and volunteered to assist Captain Arthur S. Cowan of the 20th Infantry, who was on temporary assignment in the Philippines mapping the island of Luzon. Cowan returned to the United States following completion of the cartography detail, transferred to the Signal Corps, and was assigned to recruit two lieutenants to become pilots. Cowan contacted Arnold, who cabled his interest in also transferring to the Signal Corps but heard nothing in reply for two years. In June 1909, the 29th Infantry relocated to Fort Jay, New York, and en route to his new duty station by way of Paris, Arnold saw his first airplane in flight, piloted by Louis Blériot. In 1911, Arnold applied for transfer to the United States Army Ordnance Department because it offered an immediate promotion to first lieutenant. While awaiting the results of the required competitive examination, he learned that his interest in aeronautics had not been forgotten.

===Military aviation pioneer===
Arnold immediately sent a letter requesting a transfer to the Signal Corps and on 21 April 1911, received Special Order 95, detailing him and 2nd Lt. Thomas DeWitt Milling of the 15th Cavalry, to Dayton, Ohio, for a course in flight instruction at the Wright brothers&#x27; aviation school at Simms Station, Ohio. While individually instructed, they were part of the school&#x27;s May 1911 class that included three civilians and Lieutenant John Rodgers of the United States Navy. Beginning instruction on 3 May with Arthur L. Welsh, Arnold made his first solo flight May 13 after three hours and forty-eight minutes of flight in 28 lessons. On 14 May, he and Milling completed their instruction. Arnold received Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) pilot certificate number 29 on 6 July 1911, and Military Aviator Certificate Number 2 a year later. He also was recognized by a general order in 1913 as one of the first 24 rated military aviators, authorized to wear the newly designed &quot;Military Aviator&quot; badge.

After several more weeks of solo flying in Dayton to gain experience, Arnold and Milling were sent on 14 June to the Aeronautical Division, Signal Corps station established at College Park, Maryland, to be the Army&#x27;s first flight instructors. There Arnold set an altitude record of on 7 July and thrice broke it (18 August 1911, to ; 25 January 1912, to ; and 1 June 1912, ). In August 1911, he experienced his first crash, trying to take off from a farm field after getting lost. In September Arnold became the first U.S. pilot to carry mail, flying a bundle of letters five miles (8 km) on Long Island, New York, and he is credited as the first pilot to fly over the U.S. Capitol and the first to carry a United States Congressman as a passenger. The following month, Arnold moonlighted as a pilot in the filming of two silent movies, doubling for the leads in &quot;The Military Air-Scout&quot; and &quot;The Elopement&quot;.

The flight school moved in November 1911 to a farm leased near Augusta, Georgia, hoping to continue flying there during the winter. Training was limited by rain and flooding, and they returned to Maryland in May 1912. Arnold began to develop a phobia about flying, intensified by Al Welsh&#x27;s fatal crash at College Park on 11 June. In August Arnold was at Marblehead, Massachusetts, with 1st Lieutenant Roy C. Kirtland conducting acceptance tests of the Burgess Model H, an enclosed-fuselage tandem-seat seaplane and the Army&#x27;s first tractor (front-mounted propeller and engine). The pair received orders to fly the new aircraft to Bridgeport, Connecticut, to participate in maneuvers but high winds forced them to land on Massachusetts Bay on 12 August. Attempting to take off again, Arnold caught a wing tip in the water turning into the wind and crashed into the bay off Plymouth. Arnold suffered a lacerated chin during the mishap but the aircraft was salvaged and repaired. Another crash at College Park on September 18 killed 2nd Lieutenant Lewis Rockwell, an academy classmate of Arnold&#x27;s.

In October, Arnold and Milling were ordered to enter the competition for the first MacKay Trophy for &quot;the most outstanding military flight of the year.&quot; Arnold won when he located a company of cavalry from the air and returned safely despite strong turbulence. As a result, he and Milling were sent to Fort Riley, Kansas, to experiment with radio and other communications from the air with the field artillery. Arnold&#x27;s flight on November 2 in Wright C Speed Scout S.C. Number 10, with 1st Lieutenant Follett Bradley as his wireless operator, successfully sent the first radio telegraph message, at a distance of , from an aircraft to a receiver on the ground, manned by 1st Lt. Joseph O. Mauborgne of the Signal Corps. Three days later, Arnold flew on an artillery spotting exercise with 1st Lieutenant Alfred L.P. Sands of the 6th Field Artillery as an observer. Spiraling down to land in S.C. No. 10, the plane stalled, went into a spin, and they narrowly avoided a fatal crash. He immediately grounded himself and applied for a leave of absence. Flying was considered so dangerous that no stigma was attached for refusing to fly, and his request was granted. During his leave of absence he renewed an acquaintance with Eleanor &quot;Bee&quot; Pool, the daughter of a banker, and one of his father&#x27;s patients.

On 1 December, Arnold took a staff assignment as assistant to the new head of the Aeronautical Division in the Office of the Chief Signal Officer in Washington, D.C. In the spring he was assigned the task of closing the flying school at College Park. Although promoted to 1st lieutenant on 10 April 1913, Arnold was unhappy and requested a transfer to the Philippines. While awaiting a response, he received orders to the 9th Infantry on 10 July. In August, still awaiting transfer, he testified before the House Military Affairs Committee against HR5304, a bill to remove aviation from the Signal Corps and make it a semi-autonomous &quot;Air Corps.&quot; Arnold, like fellow flyer Captain Benjamin Foulois, argued that the action was premature, and like his Signal Corps boss, Major Edgar Russel (a non-flyer), that the Signal Corps was doing all that could be done to develop military use of the airplane. He was assigned to a company at Fort Thomas, Kentucky, on 1 September, where he was stationed until transferred to the 13th Infantry on 1 November.

===Marriage and return to aviation===
On 10 September 1913, he and Bee married, with Milling acting as his best man. Sent back to the Philippines in January 1914, he was quartered near 1st Lieutenant George C. Marshall, who became his mentor, friend and patron. Soon after their arrival Bee miscarried, but on 17 January 1915, their first child, Lois Elizabeth Arnold, was born at Fort William McKinley in Manila. After eight months of troop duty, Arnold became battalion adjutant. In January 1916, completing a two-year tour with the 13th Infantry, Arnold was attached to the 3rd Infantry and returned to the United States. En route to Madison Barracks, New York, he exchanged telegrams from Hawaii with an assistant executive of the Aviation Section, Signal Corps, Major William &quot;Billy&quot; Mitchell, who alerted him that he was being detailed to the Signal Corps again, as a first lieutenant if he chose non-flying status. However, if he volunteered to requalify for a rating of &quot;Junior Military Aviator&quot;, a temporary promotion to captain was mandated by law. On 20 May 1916, Arnold reported to Rockwell Field, California, on flying status but as supply officer at the Signal Corps Aviation School. He received a permanent establishment promotion to captain, Infantry, on 23 September.

Between October and December 1916, encouraged by former associates, Arnold overcame his fear of flying by going up fifteen to twenty minutes a day in a Curtiss JN trainer, a much safer aircraft with a simpler flight control system than the Speed Scout of just four years&#x27; before. On 26 November, he flew solo, and on 16 December qualified again for his JMA. Before he could be reassigned to flying duties, however, he was involved as a witness in a controversial service dispute in January 1917. Over the objections of Captain Herbert A. Dargue, the Aviation School&#x27;s director of training, and with Arnold present, Captain Frank P. Lahm, the school secretary (adjutant), authorized on 6 January an excursion flight for a non-aviator that took place on 10 January, again over Dargue&#x27;s protests, resulting in the loss of the airplane in Mexico and the disappearance of the crew for nine days. After testifying to army investigators on 27 January, confirming that Lahm had authorized the flight in writing, Arnold was sent to Panama on 30 January 1917, one day after the birth of his second child, Henry H. Arnold Jr.
Arnold collected the men who would make up his first command, the 7th Aero Squadron, in New York City on 5 February 1917, and was ordered to find a suitable location for an airfield in the Panama Canal Zone. When the military in Panama could not agree on a site, Arnold was ordered back to Washington, D.C., to resolve the dispute and was en route by ship when the United States declared war on Germany. Arnold requested to be sent to France, but his presence in Washington worked against him, since the Aviation Section needed qualified officers for headquarters duty.

Beginning 1 May 1917, he received a series of assignments, as officer in charge of the Information Division, with a promotion to major on 27 June, as assistant executive officer of the Aeronautical Division, and then as executive officer after it became the Air Division on 1 October. On 5 August 1917, he was promoted again, becoming the youngest full colonel in the Army.

Arnold gained experience in aircraft production and procurement, the construction of air schools and airfields, and the recruitment and training of large numbers of personnel; and learned political in-fighting in the Washington environment, all of which would help him as head of the military&#x27;s air services. When the Division of Military Aeronautics superseded the Air Division in April 1918, Arnold continued as executive assistant to its director, Major General William Kenly, and advanced to assistant director when the DMA was removed from the Signal Corps in May 1918.

Arnold&#x27;s third child, William Bruce Arnold, was born 17 July 1918. Shortly after, Arnold arranged to go to France to brief General John Pershing, commanding the American Expeditionary Force, on the Kettering Bug, a weapons development. Aboard a ship to France in late October he developed Spanish influenza and was hospitalized on his arrival in England. He did reach the front on 11 November 1918, but the Armistice ended the war on the same day.

==Between the wars==
===Acolyte of Billy Mitchell===

The Air Service separated from the Signal Corps on 20 May 1918. However control of aviation remained with the ground forces when its post-war director was a field artillery general, Major General Charles T. Menoher, who epitomized the view of the War Department General Staff that &quot;military aviation can never be anything other than simply an arm of the (Army)&quot;. Menoher was followed in 1921 by another non-aviator, Maj.Gen. Mason M. Patrick. Patrick, however, obtained a rating of Junior Airplane Pilot despite being 59 years old and became both an airpower advocate and a proponent of an independent air force. Both Menoher and Patrick clashed often with Assistant Chief of Air Service Billy Mitchell, who had become radical in his desire for a single unified Air Force to control and develop all military airpower. Arnold supported Mitchell&#x27;s highly publicized views, the consequence of which was a mutual dislike with Patrick.

Arnold was sent to Rockwell Field on 10 January 1919, as District Supervisor, Western District of the Air Service, to oversee the demobilization of 8,000 airmen and surplus aircraft. There he first established relationships with the men who became his main aides, executive officer Captain Carl A. Spaatz and adjutant 1st Lieutenant Ira C. Eaker. Five months later Arnold became Air Officer of the Western Department (after June 1920 the Ninth Corps Area) in San Francisco and &quot;de facto&quot; commander of Crissy Field, being developed on a site determined by a board chaired by Arnold.

Arnold&#x27;s promotion to colonel expired 30 June 1920, and he reverted to his permanent establishment rank of captain. Even though he received an automatic promotion to major because of his Military Aviator rating, he became junior to officers serving under him, including Spaatz, whose promotion received while in France was not rescinded. On 11 August 1920, Arnold was one of 21 Infantry majors formally transferred to the Air Service by War Department Special Orders No. 188-0. As Air Service Officer of the Ninth Corps area, he oversaw the first regular aerial patrols over the forested lands of California and Oregon to assist in preventing and suppressing wildfires. (This service marked the first use of aircraft for wildfire suppression, prior to the modern use of water dropping aircraft.) Of Arnold, the National Park Service history of Crissy Field wrote: &quot;During his tour of duty, Arnold had been instrumental both in bringing Crissy Field into existence, and establishing the pattern of its operations.&quot; In October 1922 he was sent back to Rockwell, now a service depot, as base commander and there encouraged an aerial refueling, the first in history, that took place eight months later.

Arnold experienced several serious illnesses and accidents requiring hospitalization, including recurring stomach ulcers and the amputation of three fingertips on his left hand in 1922. His wife and sons also experienced serious health problems, including a near fatal case of scarlet fever for son Bruce. His fourth child, John Linton Arnold, born in the summer of 1921, died on 30 June 1923, of acute appendicitis. Both Arnold and wife Bee needed almost a year to recover psychologically from the loss.
In August 1924, Arnold was unexpectedly assigned to attend a five-month course of study at the Army Industrial College. After completing the course he was hand-picked by Patrick, despite their mutual dislike, to head the Air Service&#x27;s Information Division, working closely with Mitchell. When Mitchell was court-martialed, Arnold, Spaatz, and Eaker were all warned that they were jeopardizing their careers by vocally supporting Mitchell, but they testified on his behalf anyway. After Mitchell was convicted on 17 December 1925, his supporters including Arnold continued to use Information Division resources to promote his views to airpower-friendly congressmen and Air Service reservists. In February, Secretary of War Dwight F. Davis ordered Patrick to find and discipline the culprits. Patrick was already aware of the activity and chose Arnold to set an example. He gave Arnold the choice of resignation or a general court-martial, but when Arnold chose the latter, Patrick decided to avoid another public fiasco and instead transferred him to Ft. Riley, far from the aviation mainstream, where he took command of the 16th Observation Squadron on 22 March 1926. Patrick&#x27;s press release on the investigation stated that Arnold was also reprimanded for violating Army General Order No. 20 by attempting &quot;to influence legislation in an improper manner.&quot;

Despite this setback, which included a fitness report that stated &quot;in an emergency he is liable to lose his head&quot;, Arnold made a commitment to remain in the service, turning down an offer of the presidency of the soon-to-be operating Pan American Airways, which he had helped bring into being. Arnold made the best of his exile and in May 1927, his participation in war games at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, impressed Major General James E. Fechet, successor to Patrick as Chief of the U.S. Army Air Corps. He also received outstanding fitness reports from his commanders at Ft. Riley, Brigadier General Ewing E. Booth (who had been a member of the Mitchell court) and his successor, Brig. Gen. Charles J. Symmonds.

Repairs to Arnold&#x27;s service reputation may also have been aided by a professional article he wrote for the &quot;Cavalry Journal&quot; in January 1928, showing the influence of his association with the Cavalry School at Fort Riley. Arnold urged a strong combined arms team be developed between the Air Corps and the Cavalry; and by extension, all ground forces. This opportunity for development of the concept in both theory and practice was lost however, by the effects of cultural differences between the two service branches and the dominance of American isolationism. It did not develop until the United States was engaged in World War II.

On 24 February 1927, his son David Lee Arnold was born at Ft. Riley. In 1928 Arnold wrote and published six books of juvenile fiction, the &quot;Bill Bruce Series,&quot; whose objective was to interest young people in flying.

===Air Corps mid-career===
Fechet intervened with Army Chief of Staff Gen. Charles P. Summerall to have Arnold&#x27;s exile ended by assigning him in August 1928 to the Army&#x27;s Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth. The year-long course was unpleasant for Arnold because of doctrinal differences with the school&#x27;s commandant, Major General Edward L. King, but Arnold graduated with high marks in June 1929. Arnold was slated for assignment to the Air Corps Training Center in San Antonio following graduation, but Brigadier General Lahm, the commander of the ACTC, strongly opposed it, possibly recalling their 1917 dispute. Instead Arnold commanded the Fairfield Air Service Depot, Ohio. In 1930 he also became Chief of the Field Service Section, Air Corps Materiel Division, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 1 February 1931.

Arnold&#x27;s parents were made destitute by the bank collapses in 1929, and on 18 January 1931, his mother died of a sudden heart attack. Arnold struggled emotionally with being absent from his parents&#x27; 50th wedding anniversary celebration the year before and with the depression afflicting his father after her death. A contemporary biographer of Arnold notes that not until after his mother&#x27;s funeral did Bee begin use of the sobriquet &quot;Hap&quot; in place of &quot;Sunny&quot; when addressing him, apparently to avoid the &quot;constant reminder&quot; of his mother that the latter name might bring. Arnold himself eschewed the use of &quot;Sunny&quot; in his personal correspondence after May 1931, signing himself as &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold from that point forward.

Arnold took command of March Field, California, where Spaatz had just assumed command of the grandiose-sounding but tiny 1st Wing, on November 27, 1931. Arnold&#x27;s responsibilities included refurbishing the base into a showcase installation, which required that he resolve strained relations with the community. He accomplished this by having his officers join local social service organizations and by a series of well-publicized relief efforts. Arnold took command of the 1st Wing himself on 4 January 1933, which flew food-drops during blizzards in the winter of 1932–33, assisted in relief work during the Long Beach earthquake of 10 March 1933, and established camps for 3,000 boys of the Civilian Conservation Corps. He organized a high-profile series of aerial reviews that featured visits from Hollywood celebrities and aviation notables. In August 1932, Arnold began acquisition of portions of Rogers Dry Lake as a bombing and gunnery range for his units, a site that later became Edwards Air Force Base.
In 1934, Chief of Air Corps Benjamin D. Foulois named Arnold to command one of the three military zones of the controversial Army Air Corps Mail Operation, with a temporary headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah. Arnold&#x27;s pilots performed well and his own reputation was untouched by the fiasco. Later that same year he won his second Mackay Trophy, when he led ten Martin B-10B bombers on an flight from Bolling Field to Fairbanks, Alaska, and back. Overly credited with its success, he nonetheless lobbied for recognition of the other airmen who took part, but the deputy chief of staff ignored his recommendations. His reputation among some of his peers was tarnished by resentment when he was belatedly awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for the flight in 1937.

On 1 March 1935, General Headquarters Air Force was activated to control all combat aviation units of the Air Corps based in the United States, although it was not subordinate to the Chief of Air Corps. While a significant step towards an independent air force, this dual authority created serious problems of unity of command for the next six years. GHQAF commander Major General Frank Andrews tapped Arnold to retain command of its 1st Wing, which now carried with it a temporary promotion to the rank of brigadier general, effective 2 March 1935.

On 23 December 1935, new Army Chief of Staff General Malin Craig summoned Arnold to Washington. He and Arnold had become personal friends and golfing partners during Craig&#x27;s command of the Ninth Corps Area in 1933. Foulois had retired under fire in the wake of the Air Mail scandal and allegations of corruption in Air Corps procurement, and the new chief, Major General Oscar Westover, had asked Craig for Arnold to fill the vacant assistant chief position. Over Arnold&#x27;s protests, and despite a left-handed recommendation by Secretary of War George Dern, who recalled Arnold&#x27;s close association with Billy Mitchell, Craig made him Assistant Chief of Air Corps, responsible for procurement and supply, to deal with the political struggles over them from the Foulois years. In effect, however, Arnold had &quot;switched sides&quot; in the struggle between GHQ Air Force and the Air Corps.

===Chief of Air Corps===
Westover was killed in an air crash at Burbank, California, on 21 September, 1938. Prior vacancies in the office had been filled by an incumbent assistant chief, and Arnold&#x27;s appointment to succeed Westover seemed automatic since he was well qualified. Yet the appointment was delayed when a faction developed supporting the appointment of Andrews that included two members of the White House staff, press secretary Stephen Early and military adviser Colonel Edwin M. Watson. A rumor circulated through the White House that Arnold was a &quot;drunkard&quot;. In his memoirs, Arnold recorded that he enlisted the help of Harry Hopkins to attack the drinking rumors, but more recent research asserts that Craig threatened to resign as Army chief of staff if Arnold was not appointed. President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Arnold as Chief of Air Corps on 29 September, which carried with it the rank of major general. To repair his relationship with the Andrews faction, most of whom were part of GHQ Air Force, he selected its chief of staff, Colonel Walter G. Kilner, to fill the Assistant Chief of Air Corps vacancy. After Charles Lindbergh publicly lent his support in April 1939 for production of a very long range bomber in large numbers to counter Nazi production, development of which had been prohibited since June 1938 by the Secretary of War, Arnold appointed Kilner to head a board to make appropriate recommendations to end the R&amp;D moratorium.

Arnold encouraged research and development efforts, among his projects the B-17 and the concept of Jet-assisted takeoff. To encourage the use of civilian expertise, the California Institute of Technology became a beneficiary of Air Corps funding and Theodore von Kármán of its Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory developed a good working relationship with Arnold that led to the creation of the Scientific Advisory Group in 1944. Arnold characterized his wartime philosophy of research and development as: &quot;Sacrifice some quality to get sufficient quantity to supply all fighting units. Never follow the mirage, looking for the perfect airplane, to a point where fighting squadrons are deficient in numbers of fighting planes.&quot; To that end he concentrated on rapid returns from R&amp;D investments, exploiting proven technologies to provide operational solutions to counter the rising threat of the Axis Powers. Arnold also pushed for jet propulsion, especially after the British shared their plans of Whittle&#x27;s turbojet during his visit to Britain in April 1941. The proposal was immediately opposed by the General Staff in all respects. He and Eaker collaborated on three books promoting airpower: &quot;This Flying Game&quot; (1936, reprinted 1943), &quot;Winged Victory&quot; (1941), and &quot;Army Flyer&quot; (1942).

In March 1939 Arnold was appointed to head the Air Board by Secretary of War Harry Woodring, to recommend doctrine and organization of Army airpower to the chief of staff. While the board&#x27;s report concluded that airpower was indispensable to the defense of the hemisphere, stressed the need for long-range bombers, and became the basis for the first Air Corps field manual, it was a &quot;considerable attenuation&quot; of the doctrine being developed at the Air Corps Tactical School. Arnold submitted the findings to George C. Marshall, newly appointed as chief of staff, on 1 September 1939, the day Nazi Germany invaded Poland. When Marshall requested a reorganization study from the Air Corps, Arnold submitted a proposal on 5 October 1940, that would create an air staff, unify the air arm under one commander, and grant it autonomy with the ground and supply forces.

Congress repealed the Neutrality Act in November 1939 to permit the selling of aircraft to the belligerents, causing Arnold concern that shipments of planes to the Allies would slow delivery to the Air Corps, particularly since control of the allotment of aircraft production had been given to the Procurement Division of the Treasury Department in December 1938, and by extension, to Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr., a White House favorite. Arnold experienced two years of difficulties with Morgenthau, who was prone to denigrate the leadership of the War Department and Air Corps. Their conflict peaked on 12 March 1940, when Arnold&#x27;s public complaint about increases in shipments brought a personal warning from Roosevelt that &quot;there were places to which officers who did not &#x27;play ball&#x27; might be sent, such as Guam,&quot; and got him banished from the White House for eight months.

The disfavor shown Arnold by Roosevelt reached a turning point in March 1941 when new Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, a supporter of Arnold, submitted his name with two others for promotion to the permanent rank of major general. Roosevelt refused to send the list to the Senate for confirmation because of Arnold&#x27;s nomination, and his forced retirement from the service seemed imminent to both Stimson and Marshall. Stimson and Harry Hopkins arranged for Arnold, accompanied by Major Elwood &quot;Pete&quot; Quesada, to travel to England for three weeks in April to evaluate British aircraft production needs and to provide an up-to-date strategic analysis. One outcome of the visit was the setting up of a program for training British pilots in the US, which subsequently became known as the Arnold Scheme. Arnold&#x27;s meeting with Roosevelt to report his findings was judged as impressively cogent and optimistic, but the president ruminated on Arnold&#x27;s future for three weeks before submitting his name and the others to the Senate. From that point on, however, Arnold&#x27;s &quot;position in the White House was secure.&quot; His importance to Roosevelt in setting an airpower agenda was demonstrated when Arnold was invited to the Atlantic Conference in Newfoundland in August, the first of seven such summits that he, not Morgenthau, would attend.

==World War II==
===Reorganization, autonomy, and strategic plans===
The division of authority between the Air Corps and the GHQ Air Force was removed with promulgation of Army Regulation 95–5, creating the United States Army Air Forces on 20 June 1941, only two days before Germany&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union. Arnold became Chief of the Army Air Forces and acting &quot;Deputy Chief of Staff for Air&quot; with authority over both the Air Corps and Air Force Combat Command (successor to GHQAF). While this provided the air arm with a staff of its own and brought the entire organization under the command of one general, it failed to grant the degree of autonomy sought. By consensus between Marshall and Arnold, debate on separation of the Air Force into a service co-equal with the Army and Navy was postponed until after the war.

In July Roosevelt asked for production requirements to defeat potential enemies, and Arnold endorsed a request by his new Air War Plans Division to submit an air war plan. The assessment, designated AWPD/1, defined four tasks for the AAF: defense of the Western Hemisphere, an initial defensive strategy against Japan, a strategic air offensive against Germany, and a later strategic air offensive against Japan in prelude of invasion. It also planned for an expansion of the AAF to 60,000 aircraft and 2.1 million men. AWPD/1 called for 24 groups (approximately 750 airplanes) of very long range B-29 bombers to be based in Northern Ireland and Egypt for use against Nazi Germany, and for production of sufficient Consolidated B-36s for intercontinental bombing missions of Germany.

Soon after U.S. entry in the war, Arnold was promoted to lieutenant general on 15 December 1941. On 9 March 1942, after the creation of the AAF failed to define clear channels of authority for the air forces, the Army adopted the functional reorganization that Arnold had advocated in October 1940. Acting on an executive order from Roosevelt, the War Department granted the AAF full autonomy, equal to and entirely separate from the Army Ground Forces and Services of Supply. The Air Force Combat Command and the Office of the Chief of Air Corps were abolished, and Arnold became AAF Commanding General and an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of both the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combined Chiefs of Staff.

In response to an August 1942 directive, Arnold had the AWPD revise its estimates. AWPD/42 resulted, calling for 75,000 aircraft and 2.7 million men, and increased the production of aircraft for use by other allies. AWPD/42 reaffirmed earlier strategic priorities, but increased the list of industrial targets from 23 to 177, ranking the German Luftwaffe first and its submarine force second in importance of destruction. It also directed that the B-29 bomber not be employed in Europe because of problems in its development, but instead that the B-29 program&#x27;s deployment be concentrated in the Far East to destroy Japanese military power and combustible cities.

Arnold was responsible for approving the Army Air Forces Women&#x27;s Flying Training Detachment (WFTD). It was approved by 14 September 1942, and directed by aviator Jacqueline Cochran.

===Strategic bombing in Europe===

Immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor Arnold began to carry out AWPD/1. The primary strategic bombing force against Nazi Germany would be the Eighth Air Force, and he named Spaatz to command it and Eaker to head its Bomber Command. Other Arnold protégés eventually filled key positions in the strategic bombing forces, including Haywood S. Hansell, Laurence S. Kuter, and James H. Doolittle.

Despite protecting his strategic bombing force from demands of other services and allies, Arnold was forced to divert resources from the Eighth to support operations in North Africa, crippling the Eighth in its infancy and nearly killing it. Eaker (now Eighth Air Force commander) found from experience that the pre-war doctrine of daylight precision bombing, developed at the Air Corps Tactical School as a foundation for separating the Air Force from the Army, was mistaken in its tenet that heavily armed bombers could reach any target without the support of long-range escort fighters. Early in 1943 he began requesting more fighters and jettisonable fuel tanks to increase their range, in addition to repeated requests to increase the size of his small bombing force.

Heavy losses in the summer and fall of 1943 on deep penetration missions intensified Eaker&#x27;s requests. Arnold, under pressure and impatient for results, ignored Eaker&#x27;s findings and placed the blame on a lack of aggressiveness by bomber commanders. This came at a time when General Dwight D. Eisenhower was putting together his command group for the invasion of Europe, and Arnold approved Eisenhower&#x27;s request to replace Eaker with his own commanders, Spaatz and Doolittle.

The change in command at Eighth Air Force, particularly involving the relief of a friend or protégé, was just one of many that exemplified a ruthlessness Arnold developed to get results. In 1942, Brigadier General Walter R. Weaver, acting chief of the Air Corps, had his job eliminated and was relegated to a technical training command. George C. Kenney relieved Jacob E. Fickel in command of Fourth Air Force and later that same year replaced former Chief of the Air Corps George H. Brett as Southwest Pacific air commander. In the B-29 campaign, Curtis E. LeMay relieved Kenneth B. Wolfe in India in July 1944, and later Hansell on Guam in January 1945.

===B-29 operations against Japan===

With the strategic bombing crisis resolved in Europe, Arnold placed full emphasis on completion of the development and deployment of the B-29 Very Long Range (VLR) bomber to attack Japan. As early as 1942, Arnold planned to make himself commanding general of the Twentieth Air Force. This unique command arrangement may also have contributed to his health problems (see below), but after the negative experiences of building an effective bombing force against Germany, and realizing the consequences of failure against Japan, Arnold concluded that, absent any unity of command in the Pacific theaters, administrative decisions regarding B-29 bomber operations could best be handled personally. However, theater commanders Douglas MacArthur, Chester Nimitz, and Joseph Stilwell all coveted the B-29s for tactical support, to which Arnold was adamantly opposed as a diversion from strategic policy. He convinced not only Marshall, but also Chief of Naval Operations Ernest J. King, that the Twentieth was unique in that its operations cut across the jurisdiction of all three theaters, and thus should report directly to the Joint Chiefs with Arnold acting as their executive agent. In February 1944 President Roosevelt agreed and approved the arrangement.

The VLR program had been plagued with a seemingly unending series of development problems, subjecting it and Arnold to much criticism in the press and from skeptical field commanders. The B-29 was the key component of the AAF&#x27;s fourth strategic priority, since no other land-based bomber was capable of reaching the Japanese homeland, but by February 1944, the XX Bomber Command, slated to begin Operation Matterhorn on 1 June, had virtually no flight time yet above an altitude of .

With a designated overseas deployment date of 15 April 1944, Arnold intervened in the situation personally by flying to Kansas on 8 March 1944. For three days he toured training bases involved in the modification program. He was distressed at his findings of shortages, and of work failures. On the spot he made Maj. Gen. Bennett E. Meyers, a military procurement officer accompanying him, the coordinator of the program. Meyers succeeded in the &quot;Battle of Kansas.&quot; Despite labor problems, and blizzard weather, a complete bomb group was ready for deployment by 9 April. The mechanical problems of the B-29, however, had not been resolved. During early combat operations many new ones were identified. Arnold felt the pressure of achieving the goals of AWPD/1, and of justifying, by results, a very expensive technological project. Arnold needed the B-29 to provide the delivery platform for the highly classified atomic bomb, if the Manhattan Project succeeded. B-29 operations against Japanese targets in China and Southeast Asia began in June 1944, and from the outset produced far less positive results than expected.

The difficulties of the Twentieth Air Force&#x27;s campaign against Japan mirrored those of the Eighth Air Force&#x27;s against Germany. With characteristic impatience, Arnold quickly relieved Wolfe, the B-29 commander in China, after less than a month of operations, and replaced him with LeMay. A second B-29 command began operations from bases in the Mariana Islands in November. Brigadier General Haywood S. Hansell, one of the architects of AWPD/1 and AWPD/42, encountered even more command problems than had Wolfe or LeMay. After two months of ostensibly poor results, but mostly because he resisted a campaign of firebombing attacks against Japanese population centers favored by Arnold and his chief of staff, Lauris Norstad, Arnold decided he too needed replacing. He shut down operations from China, consolidated all the B-29s in the Marianas, and replaced Hansell with LeMay in January 1945 as commander of XXI Bomber Command.

==Final years==
===Health problems===
Between 1943 and 1945 Arnold experienced four heart attacks severe enough to require hospitalization. In addition to being by nature intensely impatient, Arnold considered that his personal presence was required wherever a crisis might be, and as a result he traveled extensively and for long hours under great stress during the war, aggravating what may have been a pre-existing coronary condition. His extended trips and inspection tours were to the United Kingdom in April 1941 and again in May 1942; the South Pacific in September 1942, North Africa and China in January–February 1943; the Middle East and Italy (where his party came under artillery fire) in November–December 1943; London and Normandy accompanying Marshall in June 1944; Germany and Italy in April–May 1945; the Western Pacific in June 1945; and Potsdam in July 1945. A lesser but more frequent factor may have been his difficulty in handling inter-service politics, particularly with the Navy, which steadfastly refused to recognize him as a chief of staff or his subordinate staff as equals. On Guam, with knowledge of the approaching atomic bomb decision, he negotiated with Nimitz over the Navy&#x27;s objections to basing the headquarters of the strategic air forces on the island.

Arnold&#x27;s first heart attack occurred 28 February 1943, just after his return from the Casablanca Conference and China. During that trip, &quot;Argonaut&quot;, the B-17 bomber transporting his party, became lost for several hours over Japanese-held territory trying to &quot;fly the Hump&quot; at night. He was hospitalized at Walter Reed Army Hospital for several days, then took three weeks leave at the Coral Gables Biltmore Hotel in Florida, which had been converted into a convalescent hospital. U.S. Army regulations then required that he leave the service, but President Roosevelt waived the requirement in April after he demonstrated his recovery, and on the condition that the President be provided with monthly updates on Arnold&#x27;s health.

Arnold&#x27;s second heart attack occurred just a month later, on 10 May 1943, and resulted in a 10-day stay in Walter Reed. Against the wishes of Marshall, he gave the commencement address for the Class of June 1943 at West Point, where his son Bruce was graduating. His third heart attack, less severe than the first two, occurred exactly a year after the second, on 10 May 1944, under the strain of the B-29 problems. Arnold took a month&#x27;s leave, returning to duty by flying with Marshall to London on 7 June for a conference and an inspection of Omaha Beach.

Arnold&#x27;s last wartime heart attack came on 17 January 1945, just days after he replaced Hansell with LeMay. Arnold had not gone into his office for three days, and refused to permit the Air Force&#x27;s chief flight surgeon to examine him. The flight surgeon enlisted a general and personal friend of Arnold&#x27;s to inquire on his condition, after which Arnold was again flown to Coral Gables, Florida, and placed under 24-hour care for nine days. Arnold again was allowed to remain in the service, but under conditions that amounted to light duty. He continued to tour air bases in both theaters. Arnold was returning by C-54 from Italy to Miami for a checkup when he received the news of the German surrender on 7 May 1945. On 16 July he relinquished command of the Twentieth Air Force to LeMay.

===Promotion and retirement===

Arnold received honorary doctorates from Pennsylvania Military College and the University of Southern California in 1941, and from Iowa Wesleyan College in 1942. Post-war honors included doctorates from Hahnemann College, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Columbia University, the University of California, and Ursinus College. Arnold also received 26 decorations and awards from foreign countries honoring his service in World War II.

On 19 March 1943, Arnold was promoted (wartime) to full general, and on 21 December 1944, appointed a five-star General of the Army under Public Law , placing him fourth in Army rank seniority, behind only Marshall, MacArthur, and Eisenhower.

In 1945, Arnold directed the founding of Project RAND (which became the RAND Corporation, a non-profit think tank) with $10,000,000 of funding left over from World War II. Initially tasked &quot;to connect military planning with research and development decisions,&quot; RAND widely expanded in its scope beyond its original mission.

After a trip to South America in January 1946, in which he developed a heart arrhythmia severe enough to cancel the remainder of the trip, Arnold left active duty in the AAF on 28 February 1946, (his official date of retirement was 30 June 1946). He issued his last order as commanding general on 8 February 1946 after which he was succeeded by Spaatz, who also became the first Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force when it became a separate service. On 23 March 1946, Public Law 79–333 made the promotion to General of the Army permanent for all those holding it, and awarded full pay and allowances for those on the retired list.

Arnold, not healthy enough to continue to work, retired to a ranch near Sonoma, California. He signed a contract with Harper &amp; Brothers to write his memoirs, &quot;Global Mission&quot;. His autobiography was an attempt to provide financial security for his wife after his death. Unlike George S. Patton, who had died suddenly in 1945 but had been independently wealthy, or his other colleagues who had taken positions in government, such as Marshall (appointed Secretary of State), Arnold had no source of income beyond his retirement pay and allowances. During the writing of it he suffered his fifth heart attack in January 1948, hospitalizing him for three months.

On 7 May 1949, changed the designation of Arnold&#x27;s final rank and grade to that of General of the Air Force, and he remains the only person to have held the rank. He is also the only person to hold five-star rank in two U.S. military services.

==Death==
Arnold died on 15 January 1950, at his home in Sonoma. He was given a state funeral in Washington, D.C., that included rare services held in Arlington Memorial Amphitheater, and he was buried in Section 34, plot number 44-A, of Arlington National Cemetery. Robert A. Lovett, with whom Arnold worked closely during the war in his capacity as Assistant Secretary of War for Air, stated that Arnold had been as much a casualty of war as if he had been injured in the line of duty.

All three of Arnold&#x27;s surviving sons were graduates of West Point (Henry Harley Jr., 1939; Willam Bruce, June 1943; and David Lee, 1949) and reached the grade of colonel. The two youngest served in the United States Air Force and are interred near their father&#x27;s burial site at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Legacy==
General H. H. Arnold Field (Athletic Field) at Lower Merion High School, Ardmore, Pennsylvania, 19003, is named for Arnold.

Arnold Air Force Base, Tennessee, and the Arnold Engineering Development Complex are named for Arnold. The Air Force Research Laboratory generally recognizes Arnold as the visionary who first articulated that superior research and development capabilities are essential to deterring and winning wars. Arnold&#x27;s ideas underpin the Laboratory&#x27;s modern-day role within the Air Force.

The cadet social center at the United States Air Force Academy, Arnold Hall, and the Arnold Hall Community Center at Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio, Texas, are both named for Arnold.

The Civil Air Patrol has named an award that accompanies the rank of Cadet Airman First Class after him, being known as the Hap Arnold Award.

The Air Force Association recognizes the &quot;most significant contribution by a military member for national defense&quot; with its H. H. Arnold Award.

The top honorary organization in Air Force ROTC, the Arnold Air Society, is named for him, and The George C. Marshall Foundation awards the George C. Marshall/Henry &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold ROTC Award annually to the top senior cadet at each college or university with an AFROTC program. The Air Force Aid Society, which he founded, awards a college scholarship in his name to the dependents of Air Force members or retirees.

On December 21, 1944, Arnold was appointed to the rank of General of the Army, placing him in the company of Dwight D. Eisenhower, George Marshall, and Douglas MacArthur, the only four men to achieve the rank in World War II, and along with Omar Bradley, one of only five men to achieve the rank since the 5 August 1888, death of Philip Sheridan, and the only five men to hold the rank as a Five-star general. The rank was created by an Act of Congress on a temporary basis when Public Law 78–482 was passed on 14 December 1944, as a temporary rank, subject to reversion to permanent rank six months after the end of the war. The temporary rank was then declared permanent 23 March 1946, by Public Law 333 of the 79th Congress, which also awarded full pay and allowances in the grade to those on the retired list. It was created to give the most senior American commanders parity of rank with their British counterparts holding the ranks of field marshal and admiral of the fleet. This second General of the Army rank is not the same as the post-Civil War era version because of its purpose and five stars.

In 1967, &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold was enshrined in the National Aviation Hall of Fame.

In 1972, Arnold was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame.

On 18 May 2006, the Department of the Air Force introduced prototypes of two new service dress uniforms, one resembling those worn by Air Service officers prior to 1926, called the &quot;Billy Mitchell heritage coat,&quot; and another, resembling the U.S. Army Air Forces&#x27; Uniform of World War II and named the &quot;Hap Arnold heritage coat&quot;. In 2007, the Air Force decided in favor of the &quot;Hap Arnold&quot; prototype, but in 2009 the new chief of staff of the Air Force directed that &quot;no further effort be made on the Hap Arnold Heritage Coat&quot; and the uniform change was suspended indefinitely.

During the last mission of the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;, STS-134, a five-star insignia of Arnold&#x27;s preserved in the National Museum of the United States Air Force was carried into space by shuttle pilot Gregory H. Johnson as a commemorative gesture to Arnold&#x27;s legacy. Arnold was then the featured honoree of the museum&#x27;s National Aviation Day celebration of 20 August 2011, when Johnson returned the insignia to the museum.

In the Great Bend Municipal Airport, the B-29 Memorial Plaza display a commemorative plaque for his contribution to the B-29 program.

The United States Department of Defense high school at the former Wiesbaden Air Base in Wiesbaden, Germany, was named General H. H. Arnold High School in 1949. The school was renamed Wiesbaden High School in 2006 after the installation was transferred to the United States Army.

On 7 November 1988, the United States Postal Service released the H. H. &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold 65 cent postage stamp bearing the likeness of Arnold, in his honor, as part of the Great Americans series.

Arnold Heights, California, is named in his honor, as is Arnold Drive, a main arterial road running through Sonoma Valley near his ranch.

Hap Arnold Boulevard, the main access road to Tobyhanna Army Depot in Tobyhanna, Pennsylvania, is named in his honor.

General Arnold was the class exemplar of the United States Air Force Academy Class of 2012.

===Film===
In a rare depiction on film, Arnold was sympathetically portrayed in the 1954 film &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot;, played by Barton MacLane. He was portrayed by Robert Brubaker in The Court Martial of Billy Mitchell. In 1977, he was again portrayed on film by actor Walter O. Miles in the two-part opus &quot;The Amazing Howard Hughes&quot;, starring Tommy Lee Jones as Hughes.

Arnold appeared in a speaking role as himself in &quot;Men of the Sky&quot;, a Technicolor propaganda short made by Warner Brothers and released on 25 July 1942. He appears as himself in the first eight minutes of the twenty-minute short, filmed in May 1942 at Merced Army Air Field, California. In the short, he alights from his C-42 staff transport at the training base to preside at a graduation ceremony for pilots completing their flight training. Arnold delivers a short address and speaks with each of four pilots (actors Tod Andrews, Don DeFore, Ray Montgomery, and Dave Willock) as he pins on their wings.

<doc id="206230" wikidata="Q37766" url="?curid=206230" title="Coonhound">
<text>A coonhound, colloquially a coon dog, is a type of scenthound, a member of the hound group. They are an American type of hunting dog developed for the hunting of raccoons and also for feral pigs, bobcats, cougars, and bears. There are six distinct breeds of coonhound.

==History==
In the colonial period, hounds were imported into North America for the popular sport of fox hunting. Various breeds of foxhounds and other hunting hounds were imported from England, Ireland, and France.

Foxhounds were found to be inadequate for hunting American animals that did not hide near the ground, but instead climbed trees, such as raccoons, opossums, bobcats, and even larger prey like cougars and bears. The dogs were often confused or unable to hold the scent when this occurred, and would mill about. 
This led to the development of treeing hounds by hunters and dog breeders. Foundation dogs were chosen for a keen sense of smell, the ability to track an animal independent of human commands and, most importantly, to follow an animal both on the ground and when it took to a tree. Bloodhounds specifically were added to many coonhound lines to enhance the ability to track. 

Coonhounds can hunt individually or as a pack. Often, hunters do not chase their quarry along with the hounds, unlike organized foxhunting, but wait and listen to the distinctive baying to determine if the prey has been treed. Coonhounds are excellent at hunting all manner of prey if trained properly.

===Memorial===
Established in 1937, the Key Underwood Coon Dog Memorial Graveyard is located in Colbert County, Alabama. It is used specifically for the burial of certified coonhounds.

==Breeds==
There are six breeds of coonhound, all of which were first recognized by the United Kennel Club: 

* The first to be officially registered was the Black and Tan Coonhound in 1900. 
* It was followed by the solid red Redbone Coonhound in 1902. 
* The third is the English Coonhound, recognized by the UKC in 1905. The English has the widest color variation of the coonhound breeds, coming in redtick, bluetick, and tricolor patterns. 
* The Bluetick Coonhound and tricolored Treeing Walker Coonhound were originally considered varieties of the English, but were split off and recognized as different breeds by 1946 and 1945, respectively. 
* The Plott Hound, a dark brindle in color, was the last to be recognized, in 1946. It is the only coonhound that does not descend from foxhounds; instead, its ancestry traces back to German boar-hunting dogs. 

The Black and Tan Coonhound was the first to be recognized by the American Kennel Club, in 1946. The other coonhound breeds were not able to be AKC-registered until the 2000s; the Redbone and Bluetick Coonhounds were both recognized in 2009, the English in 2011 (as the American English), and the Treeing Walker in 2012.

In 2008, the UKC recognized the American Leopard Hound as a scenthound breed. It is used for hunting raccoons, as well as other game animals.

== Health ==
As a breed that is often used to hunt raccoons, coonhounds are susceptible to &quot;Coonhound paralysis,&quot; or more accurately, acute canine idiopathic polyradiculoneuritis (ACIP). This condition is the often result of a dog coming into contact with a raccoon&#x27;s saliva, typically through a scratch or bite, though some cases do not involve raccoons at all. Despite the name, any breed of dog can contract the disease, but it is more commonly associated with coonhounds due to their use as raccoon hunting dogs. The disease is compared to Guillain-Barre syndrome in humans, resulting in progressive atrophy to leg muscles, starting with the rear legs and moving forward, and in some cases impacting respiratory muscles.

A study of 90,000 dog&#x27;s patient records found coonhounds to be predisposed to atopy/allergic dermatitis with 8.33% of coonhounds having the condition compared to 1.08% for mixed-breeds.

<text>The Analytical Society was a group of individuals in early-19th-century Britain whose aim was to promote the use of Leibnizian notation for differentiation in calculus as opposed to the Newton notation for differentiation. The latter system came into being in the 18th century as a convention of Sir Isaac Newton, and was in use throughout Great Britain. According to a mathematical historian:
:In 1800, English mathematics was trapped in the doldrums of fluxional notation and of an intuitive geometric-physical approach to mathematics designed to prepare the student for reading Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot;...The study of any mathematics not pertinent to the traditional questions of Tripos was not only ignored, but actually discouraged. Cambridge was isolated, and its students remained ignorant of continental developments.

The Society was first envisioned by Charles Babbage as a parody on the debate of whether Bible texts should be annotated, with Babbage having the notion that his textbook by Sylvestre Lacroix was without need for interpretation once translated. 
Its membership originally consisted of a group of Cambridge students led by Babbage and including Edward Bromhead.

The Cambridge mathematician Robert Woodhouse had brought the Leibniz notation to England with his book &quot;Principles of Analytical Calculation&quot; in 1803. While Newton&#x27;s notation was unsuitable for a function of several variables, Woodhouse showed, for instance, how to find the total differential of formula_1 where φ is a function of &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;:
:formula_2 
The slow uptake of the continental methods in calculus led to the formation of the Analytical Society by Charles Babbage, John Herschel and George Peacock.

Though the Society was disbanded by 1814 when most of the original members had graduated, its influence continued to be felt. The evidence of Analytical Society work appeared in 1816 when Peacock and Herschel completed the translation of Sylvestre Lacroix&#x27;s textbook &quot;An Elementary Treatise on Differential and Integral Calculus&quot; that had been started by Babbage. In 1817 Peacock introduced Leibnizian symbols in that year&#x27;s examinations in the local senate-house.

Both the exam and the textbook met with little criticism until 1819, when both were criticised by D.M. Peacock, vicar of Sedbergh, 1796 to 1840. He wrote:
:The University should be more on its guard ... against the introduction of merely algebraic or analytical speculations into its public examinations.

Nevertheless, the reforms were encouraged by younger members of Cambridge University. George Peacock successfully encouraged a colleague, Richard Gwatkin of St John&#x27;s College at Cambridge University, to adopt the new notation in his exams.

Use of Leibnizian notation began to spread after this. In 1820, the notation was used by William Whewell, a previously neutral but influential Cambridge University faculty member, in his examinations. In 1821, Peacock again used Leibnizian notation in his examinations, and the notation became well established.

The Society followed its success by publishing two volumes of examples showing the new method. One was by George Peacock on differential and integral calculus; the other was by Herschel on the calculus of finite differences. They were joined in this by Whewell, who in 1819 published a book, &quot;An Elementary Treatise on Mechanics,&quot; which used the new notation and which became a standard textbook on the subject.

John Ainz, a pupil of Peacock&#x27;s, published a notable paper in 1826 which showed how to apply Leibnizian calculus on various physical problems.

These activities did not go unnoticed at other universities in Great Britain, and soon they followed Cambridge&#x27;s example. By 1830, Leibniz notation was widely adopted and used alongside the traditional denotation of differentiation by use of dots as Newton had done.

==Historical demography of prefectures of Japan==
Population before 1920 was calculated based on information of , while door-to-door censuses have been held every 5 years as of October 1 since 1920, except for 1945.

As for prefectural populations before 1945, figures are only given for prefectures that officially constituted . (Southern Sakhalin) was officially incorporated into Japan Proper from March 26, 1943 until the end of the World War II, while Taiwan, the Kwantung Leased Territory, Korea and the South Seas Mandate were treated as . At the end of war, Japan lost sovereignty over Southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands (part of Hokkaidō, which Japan partly disputes).

Several demographic data remain for three ,(i.e. Kyōto-fu, Ōsaka-fu and Tōkyō-fu), 266 , 40 and one (i.e. Kaitaku-shi only in Hokkaidō) that existed for short time between Meiji Restoration and the Abolition of the han system, though not thoroughly surveyed. Prefectural system was only introduced to which the Meiji government gained from Tokugawa shogunate or the revolted , while many areas still belonged to local lordship governments.
The table below summarizes demographic data from three sources.

&quot;Source: (ref.1)&quot;&#x27;: Table of households for shi, fu and ken (Meiji-shi-yō).
::(ref.2): Kokudaka and Population Table of fu, han and ken (Ōkuma Shigenobu collection).
::(ref.3): Bunzo Kure, &quot;Estate population Table of fu, han and ken&quot; &quot;Tōkei Shūshi (Statistics Bulletin)&quot; no. 8 pp. 96–107 (1882). Estate populations were also given.

Statistical data were given as of August 29, 1871 (29th day of the 8th month, Meiji 4) for (1), as of February 2, 1869 (1st day of the 1st month, Meiji 2), for (2) or uncertain for (3), although all these populations seemed to be collected from several &quot;koseki&quot; populations surveyed in 1869 and 1870. Naotarō Sekiyama noted that the population of Japan as of August, 1870 (7th month, Meiji 3) was 32,794,897 (&quot;Kinsei Nihon jinkō-no kenkyū (Study of the Population of Japan in the Early Modern Period)&quot; (1948)).

It is quite apparent that the above demographic data contain many textual errors, but could not be corrected because the original unpublished reports preserved at the office of the Ministry of Interior of Japan were burned by a fire after the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake.

For demographic data during the Edo period, see Demographics of Japan before Meiji Restoration.

<text>A differential is a gear train with three drive shafts that has the property that the rotational speed of one shaft is the average of the speeds of the others. A common use of differentials is in motor vehicles, to allow the wheels at each end of a drive axle to rotate at different speeds while cornering. Other uses include clocks and analogue computers.
Differentials can also provide a gear ratio between the input and output shafts (called the &quot;axle ratio&quot; or &quot;diff ratio&quot;). For example, many differentials in motor vehicles provide a gearing reduction by having fewer teeth on the pinion than the ring gear.

==History==
Milestones in the design or use of differentials include:
* 100 BCE–70 BCE: The Antikythera mechanism has been dated to this period. It was discovered in 1902 on a shipwreck by sponge divers, and modern research suggests that it used a differential gear to determine the angle between the ecliptic positions of the Sun and Moon, and thus the phase of the Moon.
* : Chinese engineer Ma Jun creates the first well-documented south-pointing chariot, a precursor to the compass. Its mechanism of action is unclear, though some 20th century engineers put forward the argument that it used a differential gear.
* 1810: Rudolph Ackermann of Germany invents a four-wheel steering system for carriages, which some later writers mistakenly report as a differential.
* 1823: Aza Arnold develops a differential drive train for use in cotton-spinning. The design quickly spreads across the United States and into the United Kingdom.
* 1827: Modern automotive differential patented by watchmaker Onésiphore Pecqueur (1792–1852) of the &quot;Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers&quot; in France for use on a steam wagon.
* 1874: Aveling and Porter of Rochester, Kent list a crane locomotive in their catalogue fitted with their patent differential gear on the rear axle.
* 1876: James Starley of Coventry invents chain-drive differential for use on bicycles; invention later used on automobiles by Karl Benz.
* 1897: While building his Australian steam car, David Shearer made the first use of a differential in a motor vehicle.
* 1958: Vernon Gleasman patents the Torsen limited-slip differential.

== Use in wheeled vehicles ==
=== Purpose ===
During cornering, the outer wheels of a vehicle must travel further than the inner wheels (since they are on a larger radius). This is easily accommodated when the wheels are not connected, however it becomes more difficult for the drive wheels, since both wheels are connected to the engine (usually via a transmission). Some vehicles (for example go-karts and trams) use axles without a differential, thus relying on wheel slip when cornering. However, for improved cornering abilities, many vehicles use a differential, which allows the two wheels to rotate at different speeds.

The purpose of a differential is to transfer the engine&#x27;s power to the wheels while still allowing the wheels to rotate at different speeds when required. An illustration of the operating principle for a ring-and-pinion differential is shown below.


=== Ring-and-pinion design ===

A relatively simple design of differential is used in rear-wheel drive vehicles, whereby a ring gear is driven by a pinion gear connected to the transmission. The functions of this design are to change the axis of rotation by 90 degrees (from the propshaft to the half-shafts) and provide a reduction in the gear ratio.

The components of the ring-and-pinion differential shown in the schematic diagram on the right are: 1. Output shafts (axles) 2. Drive gear 3. Output gears 4. Planetary gears 5. Carrier 6. Input gear 7. Input shaft (driveshaft)
=== Epicyclic design ===

An epicyclic differential uses epicyclic gearing to send certain proportions of torque to the front axle and the rear axle in an all-wheel drive vehicle. An advantage of the epicyclic design is its relatively compact width (when viewed along the axis of its input shaft).
=== Spur-gear design ===
A spur-gear differential has equal-sized spur gears at each end, each of which is connected to an output shaft. The input torque (i.e. from the engine or transmission) is applied to the differential via the rotating carrier. Pinion pairs are located within the carrier and rotate freely on pins supported by the carrier. The pinion pairs only mesh for the part of their length between the two spur gears, and rotate in opposite directions. The remaining length of a given pinion meshes with the nearer spur gear on its axle. Each pinion connects the associated spur gear to the other spur gear (via the other pinion). As the carrier is rotated (by the input torque), the relationship between the speeds of the input (i.e. the carrier) and that of the output shafts is the same as other types of open differentials.

Uses of spur-gear differentials include the Oldsmobile Toronado American front-wheel drive car.
=== Locking differentials ===
&quot;Locking differentials&quot; have the ability to overcome the chief limitation of a standard open differential by essentially &quot;locking&quot; both wheels on an axle together as if on a common shaft. This forces both wheels to turn in unison, regardless of the traction (or lack thereof) available to either wheel individually. When this function is not required, the differential can be &quot;unlocked&quot; to function as a regular open differential.

Locking differentials are mostly used on off-road vehicles, to overcome low-grip and variable grip surfaces.

=== Limited-slip differentials ===
An undesirable side-effect of a regular (&quot;open&quot;) differential is that it can send most of the power to the wheel with the lesser traction (grip). In situation when one wheel has reduced grip (e.g. due to cornering forces or a low-grip surface under one wheel), an open differential can cause wheelspin in the tyre with less grip, while the tyre with more grip receives very little power to propel the vehicle forward.

In order to avoid this situation, various designs of &quot;limited-slip differentials&quot; are used to limit the difference in power sent to each of the wheels.

=== Torque vectoring ===
&quot;Torque vectoring&quot; is a technology employed in automobile differentials that has the ability to vary the torque to each half-shaft with an electronic system; or in rail vehicles which achieve the same using individually motored wheels. In the case of automobiles, it is used to augment the stability or cornering ability of the vehicle.

== Other uses ==

Non-automotive uses of differentials include performing analogue arithmetic. Two of the differential&#x27;s three shafts are made to rotate through angles that represent (are proportional to) two numbers, and the angle of the third shaft&#x27;s rotation represents the sum or difference of the two input numbers. The earliest known use of a differential gear is in the Antikythera mechanism, c. 80 BCE, which used a differential gear to control a small sphere representing the Moon from the difference between the Sun and Moon position pointers. The ball was painted black and white in hemispheres, and graphically showed the phase of the Moon at a particular point in time. An equation clock that used a differential for addition was made in 1720. In the 20th century, large assemblies of many differentials were used as analogue computers, calculating, for example, the direction in which a gun should be aimed.

===Compass-like devices===
Chinese south-pointing chariots may also have been very early applications of differentials. The chariot had a pointer which constantly pointed to the south, no matter how the chariot turned as it travelled. It could therefore be used as a type of compass. It is widely thought that a differential mechanism responded to any difference between the speeds of rotation of the two wheels of the chariot, and turned the pointer appropriately. However, the mechanism was not precise enough, and, after a few miles of travel, the dial could be pointing in the wrong direction.

===Clocks===
The earliest verified use of a differential was in a clock made by Joseph Williamson in 1720. It employed a differential to add the equation of time to local mean time, as determined by the clock mechanism, to produce solar time, which would have been the same as the reading of a sundial. During the 18th century, sundials were considered to show the &quot;correct&quot; time, so an ordinary clock would frequently have to be readjusted, even if it worked perfectly, because of seasonal variations in the equation of time. Williamson&#x27;s and other equation clocks showed sundial time without needing readjustment. Nowadays, we consider clocks to be &quot;correct&quot; and sundials usually incorrect, so many sundials carry instructions about how to use their readings to obtain clock time.

===Analogue computers===
Differential analysers, a type of mechanical analogue computer, were used from approximately 1900 to 1950. These devices used differential gear trains to perform addition and subtraction.

===Vehicle suspension===
The Mars rovers &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot; (both launched in 2004) used differential gears in their rocker-bogie suspensions to keep the rover body balanced as the wheels on the left and right move up and down over uneven terrain. The &quot;Curiosity&quot; and &quot;Perseverance&quot; rovers used a differential bar instead of gears to perform the same function.

<doc id="206243" wikidata="Q184806" url="?curid=206243" title="Biocoenosis">
<text>A biocenosis (UK English, biocoenosis, also biocenose, biocoenose, biotic community, biological community, [[Community (ecology)|ecological community]], life assemblage), coined by Karl Möbius in 1877, describes the interacting organisms living together in a habitat (biotope). The use of this term has declined in the 21st сentury.

In the palaeontological literature, the term distinguishes &quot;life assemblages&quot;, which reflect the original living community, living together at one place and time. In other words, it is an assemblage of fossils or a community of specific time, which is different from &quot;death assemblages&quot; (thanatocoenoses). No palaeontological assemblage will ever completely represent the original biological community (i.e. the biocoenosis, in the sense used by an ecologist); the term thus has somewhat different meanings in a palaeontological and an ecological context.

Based on the concept of biocenosis, ecological communities can take various forms:
*Zoocenosis for the faunal community,
*Phytocenosis for the flora community,
*Microbiocenosis for the microbial community.

The geographical extent of a biocenose is limited by the requirement of a more or less uniform species composition.

==Ecosystems==

An ecosystem, originally defined by Tansley (1935), is a biotic community (or biocenosis) along with its physical environment (or &quot;biotope&quot;). In ecological studies, biocenosis is the emphasis on relationships between species in an area. These relationships are an additional consideration to the interaction of each species with the physical environment.

==Biotic communities==

Biotic communities vary in size, and larger ones may contain smaller ones. Species interactions are evident in food or feeding relationships. A method of delineating biotic communities is to map the food network to identify which species feed upon which others and then determine the system boundary as the one that can be drawn through the fewest consumption links relative to the number of species within the boundary.

Mapping biotic communities is important identifying sites needing environmental protection, such as the British Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). The Australian Department of the Environment and Heritage maintains a register of &quot;Threatened Species and Threatened Ecological Communities&quot; under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act).

<doc id="206246" wikidata="Q7995869" url="?curid=206246" title="Abolition of monarchy">
<text>The abolition of monarchy is a legislative or revolutionary movement to abolish monarchical elements in government, usually hereditary. The abolition of an absolute monarchy in favour of limited government under a constitutional monarchy is a less radical form of anti-monarchism that has succeeded in some nations that still retain monarchs, such as Sweden, Spain, and Thailand.

Abolition has been carried out in various ways, including via abdication leading to the extinction of the monarchy, legislative reform, revolution, coup d&#x27;état, and decolonisation. Abolition became more frequent in the 20th century, with the number of monarchies in Europe falling from 22 to 12 between 1914 and 2015, and the number of republics rising from 4 to 34. Decolonisation and independence have resulted in an abolition of monarchies in a number of former colonies such as those created by the United Kingdom.

Motivations for abolition include egalitarianism and anti-class views, eliminating a rival system potentially opposed to another incoming system (as had occurred in Romania in 1947), opposition to undemocratic and hereditary institutions, perception of monarchy as anachronistic or outdated, and opposition to a particular monarch or dynasty. In many colonies and former colonies, abolishing the influence of the monarchy of a colonising state is considered part of decolonisation. In many Commonwealth realms, the monarchy may be viewed as a foreign institution running counter to the national identity or national sovereignty.

In the 21st century, some countries that are monarchies have significant republican movements, such as Spain and Australia. Since the beginning of the 20th century, restorations of monarchies have been comparatively rare. Examples are the monarchy of Spain, which since 1947 had been nominally a regency with a vacant throne but the Bourbon dynasty was restored in 1975; the reinstatement in 1991 of the Emir of Kuwait following abolition in 1990 and the Gulf War; and a 1993 transition of Cambodia from a Marxist-Leninist republic to an elective monarchy.

== Ancient world ==

=== Classical Athens ===
The city-state of Athens was ruled by monarchs in a period before the establishment of Athenian Democracy. Most of this is either mythical or semi-historical. The Athenian monarchy was abolished and replaced with lifetime archons around 1068 BC, whose power was reduced over many years.

=== Roman Kingdom/Republic ===
The Roman Republic was established after the overthrow of the seventh king of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, in 509 BC, after his disrespect for Roman customs and the Senate as well as his use of violence to control Rome.

== Civil War and English Republic ==

Under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell, in 1649, King Charles I was tried for high treason, convicted and executed. This marked the conclusion of the English Civil War which resulted in the Parliament of England overthrowing the English monarchy, and initiating a period of an English republic (known as the Wars of the Three Kingdoms). After eleven years, in 1660, a limited monarchy was restored but moderated by an independent Parliament.

In the Kingdom of England, the Glorious Revolution of 1688 furthered the constitutional monarchy, restricted by laws such as the Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701. At the same time, in Scotland, the Convention of Estates enacted the Claim of Right Act 1689, which placed similar limits on the Scottish monarchy.

== Atlantic and French Revolutions ==
=== American ===


Organized anti-monarchism in what is now the United States developed out of a gradual revolution that began in 1765, as colonists resisted a stamp tax through boycott and condemnation of tax officials. While they were subject to the authority of the Parliament of Great Britain (as the monarchy was a limited monarchy since 1660), the North American citizens increasingly clashed with the Parliament that did not provide seats for parliamentary representatives from North America. With the Declaration of Independence in 1776, anti-monarchical propaganda resulted in violent protests that systematically removed symbols of monarchy. For instance, an equestrian statue of George III in New York City was toppled. Parliamentary loyalists were particularly affected by partisan attacks, with tens of thousands leaving for British Canada. Property that remained was confiscated by each of thirteen newly created States through newly passed laws. Artifacts from the colonial period depicting the British monarchy are seldom found in the United States. However, not all sentiment equated to anti-monarchism. A normality of a monarchy at the head of a polity remained, that some Americans saw a presidency in monarchical terms, a Caesar of the republic, was an early debate in the new republic.

=== French ===


One of the most significant abolitions of monarchy in history—along with the Dutch Republic of 1581–1795—involved the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; in 1792 during the French Revolution. The French monarchy was later restored several times with differing levels of authority. Napoleon, initially a hero of the Republican revolution, crowned himself emperor in 1804, only to be replaced by the Bourbon Restoration in 1815, which in turn was replaced by the more liberal July Monarchy in 1830.

The 1848 Revolution was a clearer anti-monarchic uprising that replaced the succession of royal leaders with the short-lived Second French Republic. Louis Napoleon Bonaparte established the Second French Empire (1852–1870), retaining republican aspects while placing himself in the center of the state until the losses in the Franco-Prussian War led to his fall, resulting in the French Third Republic and the definitive end of the monarchy in France. Monarchism, which had held a majority in the National Assembly after the 1871 election, slowly fizzled out over the course of the rest of the century.

Madagascar

The monarchy of Madagascar, known as the Merina Kingdom, came to an end in 1897 when France made it a colony and overthrew Queen Ranavalona III.

Zimbabwe

In 1629, the Mwenemutapa attempted to throw out the Portuguese. He failed and in turn he himself was overthrown, leading to the Portuguese installation of Mavura Mhande Felipe on the throne. In 1917, Mambo Chioko, the last king of the dynasty, was killed in battle against the Portuguese.

=== Americas ===

Mexico

The First Mexican Empire existed from the September 1821 Declaration of Independence until the emperor&#x27;s abdication in March 1823. The Provisional Government took power and the First Mexican Republic was proclaimed in 1824. Due to French intervention under Napoleon III, the Second Mexican Empire lasted from 1864 to 1867, when it collapsed and its Emperor, Maximilian I of Mexico, was executed.

Brazil

In Brazil, the monarchy was formally established in 1815 through the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves (of which the Kingdom of Brazil was a constituent state), it evolved into the Empire of Brazil in 1822, and was abolished in 1889, when Emperor Pedro II was overthrown by a republican military coup (the status of the republic was confirmed by a plebiscite in 1993 that resulted in 86% of the votes to the republican government).

=== Asia ===

Burma

The monarchy of Burma was abolished in 1885 when the last king, Thibaw Min, lost his throne and the country was annexed by Britain.

South Asia

In 1858 the Mughal Empire came to an end after losing a war against Britain, and its Emperor, Bahadur Shah II, lost his throne.

=== Europe ===

Italy

Between 1859 and 1861, four monarchies in Southern Europe ceased to exist (Parma, Modena, Tuscany and the Two Sicilies) when they all became part of the new Kingdom of Italy.

Spain

In Spain monarchy was abolished from 1873 to 1874 by the First Spanish Republic, but then restored until 1931.

=== Pacific ===

Hawaii

In 1893 foreign business leaders overthrew Queen Liliʻuokalani of the Kingdom of Hawaii. They established a republic, which was annexed by the United States in 1898.

Tahiti

The monarchy of Tahiti came to an end in 1880 when France made it a colony and overthrew King Pōmare V.

Manu&#x27;a

After ceding sovereignty of the Manu&#x27;a islands of modern-day American Samoa to the United States in 1904, the last King of Manu&#x27;a, Tui Manu&#x27;a Elisara, died on 2 July 1909. All attempts to revive the position since his death have been met with opposition by the United States Government.

== 20th century ==

==== China ====

The monarchy of China ceased to exist in 1912 when the Xinhai Revolution led by Sun Yat-sen succeeded in overthrowing the young Xuantong Emperor; this marked the end of the Qing dynasty and the start of the Republic of China. In 1915, Yuan Shikai briefly proclaimed the Empire of China with himself as the emperor; the regime failed to gain legitimacy and collapsed three months later. In 1917, the Qing loyalist Zhang Xun sought to revive the Qing dynasty and briefly reinstalled the Xuantong Emperor to the Chinese throne; this attempt is known as the &quot;Manchu Restoration&quot; in historiography. The monarchy in parts of China was restored through the Japanese-sponsored client state known as Manchukuo with the former Qing emperor as its leader until the final abolition in 1945.

The area of Tibet was ruled by the Ganden Phodrang government which continued through the annexation of Tibet by the People&#x27;s Republic of China until the Tibetan rebellion in 1959 where the monarchy in Tibet was dissolved although it continued in exile as the Central Tibetan Administration in India.

During the Xinhai Revolution, Outer Mongolia declared independence from the Qing dynasty of China in the Mongolian Revolution of 1911. The Bogd Khanate of Mongolia was subsequently proclaimed, although the Republic of China laid claims to Outer Mongolia and was widely recognized by the international community as having sovereignty over it. In 1924, the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic was established, bringing an end to the monarchy in Mongolia.

=== World War I and aftermath ===

==== Russian Empire ====

World War I led to perhaps the greatest number of abolition of monarchies in history. The conditions inside the Russian Empire and the poor performance in the war gave rise to a revolution which toppled the entire institution of the monarchy, followed by a second revolution against that government in October of the same year that executed Tsar (Imperator (Императоръ)) Nicholas II and implemented a Marxist-Leninist government. The Russian Civil War saw various monarchist, Republican, anarchist, nationalist and socialist factions fight each other with bourgeois independence movements winning in the Baltic States, Poland and Finland and the Bolsheviks winning everywhere else.

The defeated German, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires saw the abolition of their monarchies in the close aftermath of the war, ending the reigns of Wilhelm II, Charles I and Mehmed VI respectively. The monarchs of the constituent states within the German Empire, most importantly Ludwig III of Bavaria, Frederick Augustus III of Saxony and Wilhelm II of Württemberg, soon abdicated. During the war, monarchies were planned for Poland (Kingdom of Poland), the Grand Duchy of Finland (to have a Finnish King), and Lithuania (Mindaugas II of Lithuania), with a protectorate-like suzerainty exercised by the German Empire. Both intended kings renounced their thrones after Germany&#x27;s defeat in November 1918. King Nicholas I of Montenegro lost his throne when the country became a part of Yugoslavia in 1918.

=== World War II and aftermath ===

==== Italy, Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, Croatia ====

World War II saw another increased number of abolition of monarchies. In 1922, Benito Mussolini&#x27;s March on Rome led to King Victor Emmanuel III appointing Mussolini Prime Minister. In 1939 Italy invaded Albania and removed the reigning self-proclaimed King Zog and instated their own King Victor Emmanuel III as its new monarch. Italy, along with the eastern European monarchies of Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania were forced to join with Germany by their dictators in World War II against the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Western allies and the Soviet Union. When Yugoslavia fell in 1941 the Independent State of Croatia was established under a nominal monarchy, but it was in fact a one party state under Ante Pavelić and a puppet state of Nazi Germany. With the fall of Mussolini in July 1943, the monarchy in Croatia was abolished. As the Axis powers were defeated in the war, communist partisans in occupied Yugoslavia and occupied Albania seized power and ended the monarchies. Communists in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania removed their monarchies with strong backing by the Soviet Union, which had many troops and supporters placed there during the course of the war. Through this, Peter II of Yugoslavia, Simeon II of Bulgaria and Michael I of Romania all lost their thrones. King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy had remained King after the Fall of the Fascist regime in Italy but transferred most of his powers to his son after the Armistice of Cassibile. After Victor Emmanuel abdicated to save the monarchy, a narrow referendum in 1946 ended the short reign of his son King Umberto II and the Italian monarchy ceased to exist.

=== Republicanism ===

==== Australia (monarchy kept after referendum) ====

In a 1999 referendum, the voters of Australia rejected a proposal to replace the constitutional monarchy with a republic with a president appointed by Parliament. The proposal was rejected in all states, with only the Australian Capital Territory voting in favour. Though polling consistently showed a majority in favour of a republic, the result of the referendum was attributed to a split among republicans between those who supported the presented model and those who supported a directly elected president.

==== Greece ====
In the modern history of Greece, the monarchy was toppled in 1924, as a result of the National Schism and the Asia Minor Disaster. The resulting Second Hellenic Republic led a troubled existence, until a coup restored the monarchy in 1935. The subsequent dictatorial 4th of August Regime was established with the support of King George II of Greece, further delegitimizing the monarchy.

During the Axis occupation of Greece, George II nominally led the Greek government in exile, but the post-war fate of the monarchy was a major dividing issue for Greeks, especially with the rise of the pro-communist National Liberation Front (EAM) as the country&#x27;s largest resistance movement. As a compromise, the issue was to be determined by a referendum after the war. In the end, the threat of a post-war communist takeover led the Venizelist republicans to ally with the monarchists; with the defeat of EAM in the &quot;Dekemvriana&quot;, the subsequent White Terror, and the outbreak of the Greek Civil War in 1946 resulted in a monarchist victory in the 1946 referendum and the return of George II to the country.

The last king, Constantine II, interfered in politics during the Apostasia of 1965. The resulting political crisis led to a military coup in April 1967. Constantine II reluctantly accepted the &quot;fait accompli&quot; and lent it legitimacy, but when he tried to stage a counter-coup later that year, he was defeated and forced into exile. Greece formally remained a monarchy until it was abolished by the military junta in June 1973, followed by a July referendum confirming that decision. The restoration of the monarchy was overwhelmingly defeated, after constitutional legality was restored, by a free referendum in 1974.

==== Spain ====

In Spain, the monarchy was again abolished in 1931 by the Second Spanish Republic (1931–1939). In 1947, Francisco Franco declared Spain a monarchy but kept himself as regent for life with the constitutional setup essentially unchanged. Per the right the 1947 law granted him to decide &quot;who&quot; would be the future Spanish monarch, he appointed Juan Carlos of Bourbon his successor in 1969. The &quot;Prince of Spain&quot; became king at Franco&#x27;s death in 1975, and during the Spanish transition to democracy, the Spanish constitution of 1978 put the monarchy on a new constitutional basis. The existence of monarchy in Spain is an entrenched clause with much stricter rules for constitutional amendment than other constitutional provisions.

==== Portugal ====

The monarchy of Portugal was also overthrown in 1910, two years after the assassination of King Carlos I, ending the reign of Manuel II, who died in exile in England in 1932 without issue.

=== Communism, socialism, and Islamism ===

==== Afghanistan ====

In 1973, the monarchy of King Mohammed Zahir Shah of Afghanistan was abolished after a socialist-supported coup d&#x27;état led by Mohammad Daoud Khan, from the same Musahiban royal family, who declared himself the first President of Afghanistan.

==== Ethiopia ====

Emperor Haile Selassie I was overthrown in 1974 as a result of the Ethiopian Revolution, ending almost three millennia of monarchical rule in Ethiopia.

==== Indochina ====

In 1945, during the August Revolution, Bảo Đại abdicated under the pressure of the Việt Minh led by Ho Chi Minh. This marked the end of the Nguyễn dynasty and the Vietnamese monarchy. From 1949 to 1955, Bảo Đại served as the &quot;Quốc Trưởng&quot; (lit. &quot;Chief of State&quot;) of the State of Vietnam and did not receive the title of &quot;Hoàng Đế&quot; (lit. &quot;Emperor&quot;).

Political upheaval and Communist insurrection put an end to the monarchies of Indochina after World War II: a short-lived attempt to leave a monarchical form of government in post-colonial South Vietnam came to naught in a fraudulent 1955 referendum, a military coup overthrew the kingless monarchy in Cambodia in 1970 and a Communist takeover ended the monarchy in Laos in 1975. Cambodia&#x27;s monarchy later saw an unexpected rebirth under an internationally mediated peace settlement with former king Norodom Sihanouk being restored as a figurehead in 1993.

==== Iran ====

The Pahlavi dynasty&#x27;s rule in Iran ended following the Iranian Revolution of 1979 overthrowing Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and leading to the establishment of an Islamic republic.

=== Dictatorship ===

==== Arab countries ====

In some Arab countries, coups d&#x27;état replaced monarchies with military dictatorships.

The monarchy of Egypt was abolished in 1953, a year after the military overthrow of King Farouk, which caused him to abdicate in favour of his infant son Fuad II. The monarchy of Iraq ended in 1958 when King Faisal II was killed and a republic proclaimed. The monarchy of Yemen was abolished in 1962 when King Muhammad al-Badr was overthrown in a coup, although he continued to resist his opponents until 1970. King Idris of Libya was overthrown by a military coup led by Muammar Gaddafi in 1969.

=== Imperialism expansion and decolonisation ===

==== Commonwealth of Nations ====

Many monarchies were abolished in the middle of the 20th century or later as part of the process of decolonization. This included several Commonwealth realms, which were sovereign states in personal union with the monarchy of the United Kingdom.

The monarchy of Ireland was not abolished following the Irish war of independence in the 1920s. The Irish Free State was created as a separate state from the United Kingdom; it was nominally a monarchy but transitioned towards a more republican form of government throughout its existence. The Irish Constitution that came into force in 1937 left the question of Republic or monarchy vague, but established a President of Ireland, an office usually absent in monarchies. The monarchy was officially abolished by the Republic of Ireland Act of 1948, which came into force in 1949.

The monarchies of India, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Tanganyika, Uganda, Guyana, and Malawi were abolished shortly after they became independent of the United Kingdom, whilst remaining within the Commonwealth. Others waited longer before abolishing their monarchies, such as Pakistan, South Africa, The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Malta, Trinidad and Tobago, and Mauritius. The latest country to become a republic within the Commonwealth was Barbados in 2021.

With the exceptions of Ireland and India, in each case the deposed monarch was Elizabeth II. Most realms which abolished their monarchy did so by declaring a new constitution or amending it to remove references to the Crown, with the exception of Fiji, whose monarchy was abolished in 1987 following a series of coups d&#x27;état.

==== Korea ====

In 1910 the last emperor of Korea, Sunjong, lost his throne when the country was annexed by Japan. However, the Korean royal family was mediatized as a puppet family within the Japanese imperial family. Many of the Korean royals were forcibly re-educated in Japan and forced to marry Japanese royalty and aristocrats to meld the ruling families of the two empires. With the abolition of the Japanese aristocracy and cadet branches of the imperial family, the Korean royals officially lost their remaining status.

==== South Asia ====

The independence of India from the United Kingdom in 1947 posed a unique problem. From 1858, when the British government replaced Company rule with direct Crown rule, it had been governed as a quasi-federation, with much of the country under the direct rule of the British monarch, who was styled as the Emperor of India. The remainder of the country, however, was under a form of indirect rule under him through its division into over 500 subnational monarchies, known as princely states; each was ruled by a prince who acknowledged the suzerainty of the Indian Emperor. The princely states ranged from powerful and largely independent principalities such as Hyderabad or Mysore, with a high level of autonomy, to tiny fiefdoms a few dozen acres (in the low tens of hectares) in size.

In 1947, it was agreed that India would be partitioned into the independent British dominions of India and Pakistan, with the princely states acceding to one nation or the other. The accession process proceeded smoothly, with the notable exception of four of the most influential principalities. The Muslim ruler of the Hindu-majority state of Junagadh acceded to Pakistan, but his decision was overruled by the Indian government, while Hyderabad chose to be independent, but was forcibly annexed to India in 1948. The Hindu ruler of Jammu and Kashmir, among the largest and most powerful of the principalities, but with a Muslim-majority population, initially held off on a decision. In the autumn of 1947, an invading force from Pakistan frightened the ruler into acceding to India. The ruler of Kalat, in Baluchistan, declared his independence in 1947, after which the state was forcibly merged with Pakistan, resulting in an insurgency persisting to this day. With the promulgation of the Indian constitution in 1950, India abolished its monarchy under the British crown and became a Republic within the Commonwealth of Nations, followed by Pakistan in 1956; as a result of both developments, the majority of the princes formally lost their sovereign rights. A few remaining principalities in Pakistan retained their autonomy until 1969 when they finally acceded to Pakistan. The Indian government formally derecognized its princely families in 1971, followed by Pakistan in 1972.

Finally, in 1975, King Palden Thondup Namgyal of Sikkim lost his throne when the country became a state of India following a referendum.

=== New monarchies ===
The 20th century also saw the formation of a number of new monarchies that still exist to this day such as Bhutan (1907), Jordan (1921), Saudi Arabia (1932), and Malaysia (1957).

== 21st century ==
The Kingdom of Nepal was transformed into a republic by the 1st Nepalese Constituent Assembly in 2008. Barbados abolished its monarchy and became a republic on 30 November 2021 following a constitutional amendment by the Parliament.

In addition, protests in support of a republican form of government took place in Malaysia in 2012, and Cambodia the following year. In 2013, an alleged coup plot by Al Islah to overthrow the monarchy of the United Arab Emirates and establish an Islamic republic failed. Following the accession of Charles III in 2022, anti-monarchy protests also occurred in the United Kingdom; some protesters were arrested, but were later released without further action being taken.

== Monarchism in former monarchies ==

In a referendum in Brazil in 1993, voters rejected an attempt to restore the country&#x27;s monarchy. Unsuccessful efforts to restore the monarchies of some of the Balkan states in the former Eastern Bloc continue. Former King Michael of Romania and Prince Alexander of Serbia had been allowed to return, gained some popularity, played largely apolitical public roles, but never came close to being restored to their ancestral thrones. However, in Bulgaria, Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, who was deposed from the Bulgarian throne in 1946, was elected and served as the Prime Minister of his country from 2001 to 2005. The only formerly communist country to have held a referendum on the monarchy was Albania, where the claimant to his father&#x27;s throne, the self-styled Leka I, lost by a two-thirds majority.

== Summary table since the 20th century ==

== Monarchies that were abolished, restored, and continue to exist in the 21st century ==

Many other monarchies continue to exist in the 21st century, never having been abolished.

<text>The Dominions of Sweden or &quot;Svenska besittningar&quot; (&quot;Swedish possessions&quot;) were territories that historically came under control of the Swedish Crown, but never became fully integrated with Sweden. This generally meant that they were ruled by Governors-General under the Swedish monarch, but within certain limits retained their own established political systems, essentially their diets. Finland was not a dominion, but a land of Sweden. The dominions had no representation in the Swedish Riksdag as stipulated by the 1634 Instrument of Government paragraph 46: &quot;No one, who is not living inside the separate and old borders of Sweden and Finland, have anything to say at Riksdags and other meetings...&quot;

== Baltic Dominions ==

Between 1561 and 1629 Sweden made conquests in the Eastern Baltic. All of them were lost in accordance with the Treaty of Nystad in 1721, which concluded the Great Northern War.

=== Estonia ===

Estonia placed itself under Swedish rule in 1561 to receive protection against Russia and Poland as the Livonian Order lost their foothold in the Baltic provinces. Territorially it represented the northern part of present-day Estonia.

The area was significantly populated by Estonian Swedes, who inhabited the area for centuries after Sweden lost control of it. After the Soviet Union&#x27;s Baltic offensive and re-occupation of Estonia in 1944, nearly all the Estonian Swedes fled to Sweden proper.

=== Kexholm ===

Kexholm was a sparsely inhabited part of Karelia on the Western and Northern shores of Lake Ladoga, annexed by Sweden in 1605. At that time, most inhabitants were Finnish-speaking Orthodox Christians. During the 17th century, Lutheran persecution of Orthodox Christianity and an influx of Lutheran Finns from neighbouring province of Savonia converted most of the area into Lutheran faith. The Swedish law and the Swedish structure of local administration were used in the area which does not seem to have had any prior written legal tradition. Nowadays the county is divided between Finnish regions of North Karelia and South Karelia and the Russian Republic of Karelia.

=== Ingria ===

Russia ceded Ingria and southern Karelia to Sweden in the Treaty of Stolbovo in 1617, following the Ingrian War. A century later Russia reconquered the area, providing an opportunity for Peter the Great to lay the foundations of his new capital, Saint Petersburg, in 1703. The area was then formally ceded in 1721 by the Treaty of Nystad.

=== Riga ===

The Hanseatic city of Riga fell under Swedish control in the late 1620s. For the nearly hundred years that followed, Riga was the second largest city in the Swedish Empire, after Stockholm.

=== Livonia ===

Livonia was conquered from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by 1629 in the Polish-Swedish War. By the Treaty of Oliva between the Commonwealth and Sweden in 1660 following the Northern Wars the Polish-Lithuanian king renounced all claims to the Swedish throne and Livonia was formally ceded to Sweden. Swedish Livonia represents the southern part of present-day Estonia and the northern part of present-day Latvia (Vidzeme region).

=== Lithuania ===
During the Second Northern War, Lithuanian nobility signed a series of acts with the Swedish Empire and became its protectorate in 1655 with King Charles X Gustav serving as its Grand Duke. However, following Sweden&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Prostki and weak military presence in the region, the protectorate fell in 1657 and Lithuania was once again reincorporated into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

=== Ösel ===

By the Treaty of Brömsebro (1645), following the Torstenson War, Denmark-Norway ceded Jämtland, Härjedalen, Idre &amp; Särna, Gotland, Halland and Ösel to Sweden. Ösel and Dagö, islands off the coast of Estonia, were ceded to Russia in 1721 by the Treaty of Nystad. The other territories remained part of Sweden.

== Scanian Dominion ==

By the peace treaties of Brömsebro (1645) and Roskilde (1658) the Realm of Sweden expanded to the south. Blekinge, Bohuslän (of Norway), Halland and Scania were ceded by Denmark in the latter and then successfully defended in the Scanian War (1675–1679). According to the peace treaties the provinces were to retain its old laws and privileges, and was initially administered as a dominion. A gradual process of incorporation was successfully concluded in 1721.

== Continental Dominions ==

Through its minor German principalities, the Swedish kings in their roles as princes and dukes, or &quot;Reichsfürsten&quot;, of the Holy Roman Empire took part in the German diets from 1648 until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806.

=== Bremen and Verden ===

Following the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 assigned to Sweden the two bishoprics of Bremen-Verden, with the exclave of Wildeshausen. All of them were ceded to Hanover in the peace treaty of 1719.

=== Pomerania ===
By the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 Sweden received Swedish Pomerania, situated along the German Baltic Sea coast. The whole Duchy of Pomerania was under Swedish control already since the Treaty of Stettin (1630), and in the Treaty of Stettin (1653) Sweden and Brandenburg agreed on the final terms of the partition of the duchy, with Sweden keeping the western part (Western Pomerania, Vorpommern) including Stettin. In 1720 the southern parts of Swedish Pomerania with the town of Stettin and the islands of Usedom and Wollin were ceded to the Kingdom of Prussia, following the Great Northern War. The capital was moved to Greifswald. In 1814 the remainder, with the town of Stralsund and the island of Rügen was ceded to Denmark, which in exchange ceded Norway to the king of Sweden under the Treaty of Kiel, which followed on War of the Sixth Coalition. However the treaty of Kiel never came into force: instead sovereignty of Western Pomerania passed to Kingdom of Prussia, which already held the eastern parts and merged them into the Province of Pomerania. Norway declared its independence, but was forced after a short war into a personal Union with Sweden.

=== Wismar ===
Sweden received the German town of Wismar with the surrounding countryside in the Peace of Westphalia (1648). In 1803 Wismar was pawned, in exchange for a loan, and control was handed over to Mecklenburg. The loan defaulted in 1903, but Sweden rescinded its right to regain control of the German exclave and thereby nominally received its present territorial constitution.

<text>Theodahad, also known as Thiudahad (; 480 – December 536), was the co-monarch of the Ostrogothic Kingdom with his cousin Amalasuintha in 534 and became the sole ruler from April 535 until his death in December 536. In contrast to the reign of Theodoric the Great, Theodahad&#x27;s rule is generally regarded as a failure.

== Early life ==
Born in Tauresium, now in North Macedonia, around 480, Theodahad was the nephew of Theodoric the Great through his mother, Amalafrida. He was likely the son of Amalafrida&#x27;s first husband, as her second marriage occurred around 500. His sister was Amalaberga, and his father&#x27;s identity remains unknown. 

Theodahad may have arrived in Italy with Theodoric and was likely elderly at the time of his accession. According to Massimiliano Vitiello, the name &quot;Theodahad&quot; is a compound of the words for &#x27;people&#x27; and &#x27;conflict&#x27;.

In his early life, Theodahad studied Plato and other Greek philosophers and amassed considerable wealth through property acquisitions in Tuscany, Italy, sometimes employing violent methods. He was later compelled to compensate citizens for land he had seized after a Byzantine envoy, sent by Queen Amalasuintha—who was ruling in her son&#x27;s stead—arrived in Rome and Ravenna. Procopius&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot; recount that Amalasuintha sent letters to the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I, seeking his support for her rule and addressing Theodahad&#x27;s attempts to sell the land he had acquired to Byzantine nobles and even to Justinian himself. Theodahad had a wife and three children: two sons, including Theodegisclus, and a daughter named Theodenanthe, both of whom are mentioned in Procopius&#x27;s writings.

== King and accession to the throne ==
Although Theodahad was born into nobility in the Ostrogothic Kingdom, it appears he was never considered a serious heir to the throne by Theodoric. This view is supported by historians and is evidenced by Theodahad&#x27;s lack of battlefield experience. Initially dismissed as slander by Procopius, this assessment has since gained scholarly support.

Theodahad&#x27;s cousin, Amalasuintha, ruled as regent for ten years on behalf of her son Athalaric and continued to govern after his death. Her pro-Byzantine stance and gender made her a target of opposition from many Ostrogothic nobles, some of whom were executed for alleged plots against her. To bolster her position, Amalasuintha appointed Theodahad as co-monarch. Before this appointment, Theodahad had to swear loyalty to Amalasuintha and marry into the line of succession, aligning himself with Emperor Justinian I.

Amalasuintha hoped to rehabilitate Theodahad&#x27;s reputation following his controversial land acquisitions in Tuscany, urging the Roman Senate to recognize him as a capable landowner who could contribute to the kingdom&#x27;s prosperity. However, her efforts met with mixed results. While Amalasuintha struggled to gain support due to her gender and connections to Constantinople, Theodahad remained unpopular among the nobility.

Amalasuintha also had to prepare Theodahad for the responsibilities of kingship, as he had not been groomed for the throne by his predecessor Theodoric. Theodahad&#x27;s lack of interest in learning about governance suggested he was reluctant to rule. His early life focused on acquiring and selling land, possibly in preparation for retirement in the East.

Resentful of Amalasuintha for her actions in Tuscany, Theodahad eventually had her exiled to an island in Lake Bolsena near Orvieto, where she was assassinated. In response to her death, Emperor Justinian I initiated military actions in Sicily, marking the beginning of the Gothic Wars.

== Gothic War ==
Following the death of Amalasuintha, Emperor Justinian I seized the opportunity to invade Sicily, swiftly conquering it in hopes of reuniting the Eastern and Western Roman Empires. In response, Theodahad sought to negotiate peace with the envoys sent by Justinian before the invasion began, hoping to secure his freedom by potentially selling the kingdom.

Justinian dispatched one of his most capable commanders, Belisarius, to conquer Italy from Theodahad and the Ostrogoths. Ill-prepared for the demands of war due to his lack of experience and knowledge, Theodahad struggled to mount an effective defense.

Theodahad&#x27;s son-in-law, Ebremud, was sent to face Belisarius but deserted the Gothic forces upon encountering him. Despite having studied Plato, Theodahad failed to strengthen his armies after initiating negotiations with Constantinople. As he took refuge in the cities of Ravenna and Rome, dissatisfaction grew among the Goths due to his inadequate preparation for war and his refusal to assist the besieged city of Naples. This discontent led to the election of a new king, Witiges, a former general under Theodoric the Great.

Upon learning of Witiges&#x27;s election, Theodahad returned to Ravenna in an attempt to reclaim control and secure himself from the advancing Byzantine forces. During this retreat, Witiges sent a Goth named Optaris to either capture or kill Theodahad. Optaris, who harbored personal grievances against Theodahad due to his actions towards a woman Optaris had courted, succeeded in killing Theodahad.

Following Theodahad&#x27;s death, Witiges was declared king of the Ostrogoths.

==In fiction==
Theodahad is featured in Felix Dahn&#x27;s 1876 historical novel &quot;Ein Kampf um Rom&quot;, which was translated into English in 1878 as &quot;A Struggle for Rome&quot;. In this novel, he is portrayed as weak and subservient to his wife, Gothelinda, who is depicted as the true orchestrator of Amalasuintha&#x27;s murder.

Theodahad also appears, under the name &quot;Thiudahad,&quot; in L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s 1939 alternate history novel &quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot;.

<text>Mare Australe (Latin &quot;austrāle&quot; the &quot;Southern Sea&quot;) is a lunar mare located in the southeastern hemisphere of the Moon. It is 997 kilometers in diameter, overlapping the near and far sides of the Moon. Smooth, dark volcanic basalt lines the bottom of the mare. The Australe basin was formed in the Pre-Nectarian epoch, while the mare material inside formed in the Upper Imbrian epoch. The basin was almost completely destroyed by impacts prior to the appearance of the mare.

Unlike most of the lunar maria, Mare Australe has an uneven surface that is marked by a number of crater impacts. Examples of these include the craters Jenner and Lamb, which are flooded with basaltic lava much like many of the other crater features in this mare. The selenographic coordinates of this mare are 38.9° S, 93.0° E. The eastern half of the mare lies on the far side of the Moon, although it can be viewed in its entirety during periods of favorable libration.

<text>Mare Cognitum (Latin &quot;cognitum&quot;, the &quot;Sea that has Become Known&quot;) is a lunar mare located in a basin or large crater which sits in the second ring of Oceanus Procellarum. To the northwest of the mare is the Montes Riphaeus mountain range, part of the rim of the buried crater or basin containing the mare. Previously unnamed, the mare received its name in 1964 in reference to its selection as the target for the successful impact probe Ranger 7, the first American spacecraft to return closeup images of the Moon&#x27;s surface.

==Origin==
The basin material is of the Pre-Nectarian epoch, while most of the basaltic mare material is of the Upper Imbrian epoch.

==Exploration==
The Ranger 7 lunar probe impacted Mare Cognitum at the conclusion of its picture-taking mission. Surveyor 3 and Apollo 12 landed near its northern shore. The outcrop of the Fra Mauro formation, where Apollo 14 landed, is also located near Mare Cognitum.

===Statio Cognitum===

On November 19, 1969, astronauts Pete Conrad and Alan Bean landed Apollo 12&#x27;s Lunar Module within walking distance of Surveyor 3, which had been on the Moon since 1967. Named &quot;Statio Cognitum&quot; the site&#x27;s closeness to its intended target demonstrated NASA&#x27;s capability of precise lunar landings. The location also provided a relatively smooth Mare surface and a proximity to the lunar equator, thus ensuring relative ease of access from the standpoint of fuel consumption. 

Geologically, the astronauts noted the amount of glass contained in the regolith and present at the bottoms of shallow craters at the site, as well as lighter-colored regolith material that geologists later determined to be ejecta from Copernicus crater. The Copernicus ejecta sampled suggested that the Copernicus impact occurred about 800 million years ago, but geologists believe the results of this analysis are inconclusive. The Apollo 12 astronauts also noted the existence of small, shallow elongated depressions (&quot;trenches&quot; or &quot;grooves&quot;) similar to those the Apollo 11 astronauts observed at Tranquility Base in the Sea of Tranquility; Shoemaker et al. preliminarily concluded in 1970 that these features reflected the direction and location of fractures in the underlying bedrock, into which fine-grained material settled, thereby creating the grooves. 

Overall, Statio Cognitum and the surrounding area appears to have a slightly more red coloration from lunar orbit than Tranquility Base (which geologists later found to be the result of less titanium in the Apollo 12 rocks) and to have fewer craters overall than Tranquility Base; because of this, geologists suspected the site chosen for Apollo 12 contained younger rocks than those of the Apollo 11 site, and this was confirmed by the samples returned by Apollo 12. These samples consisted of more basalts and fewer breccias than the Apollo 11 samples and the basalts are about 500 million years younger than those from Tranquility base, the latter of which geologists estimate to be about 3.6 to 3.8 billion years old. The differing ages of the basalts collected on Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 demonstrate that the volcanic activity that formed the lunar mare did not occur all at once across the lunar surface, but rather took place at different times at different locations.

<text>Media imperialism (sometimes referred to as cultural imperialism) is an area in the international political economy of communications research tradition that focuses on how &quot;all Empires, in territorial or nonterritorial forms, rely upon communications technologies and mass media industries to expand and shore up their economic, geopolitical, and cultural influence.&quot; In the main, most media imperialism research examines how the unequal relations of economic, military and cultural power between an imperialist country and those on the receiving end of its influence tend to be expressed and perpetuated by mass media and cultural industries.

In the 1970s, research on media imperialism was mainly concerned with the expansion of US-based news and entertainment corporations, business models, and products into postcolonial countries as related to the problems of communication and media sovereignty, national identity formation and democracy. In the 21st century, research on media imperialism probes the whole gamut of the media, for example, how an Empire&#x27;s global economic, military and cultural expansion and legitimization is supported by &quot;the news, telecommunications, film and TV, advertising and public relations, music, interactive games, and internet platforms and social media sites.&quot;

For the past seventy years, media imperialism research has been undertaken by a wide range of international communication and media studies scholars, North and South. Some of the key researchers in this area are: Oliver Boyd-Barrett, Luis R. Beltrán and Elizabeth Fox, Ariel Dorfman, Thomas Guback, Cees Hamelink, Dal Yong Jin, Armand Mattelart, Robert W. McChesney, Tom McPhail, Toby Miller and Richard Maxwell, Tanner Mirrlees, David Morley, Graham Murdock, Kaarle Nordenstreng, Herbert I. Schiller, Dallas Smythe, Colin Sparks, Daya Thussu, and Jeremy Tunstall.

==History of the concept==
The concept of media imperialism emerged in the 1970s when political leaders, media producers, and some citizens in postcolonial countries began to criticize the ownership and control Western and American media conglomerates wielded over much of the global communication and media system. Representatives of postcolonial countries proposed a New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO) at UNESCO to contest and counter-balance the enduring and enlarging global communication and media powers of old and new imperial countries (e.g., the United Kingdom and United States). Supported by the MacBride report, &quot;Many Voices, One World&quot;, countries such as India, Indonesia, and Egypt argued that the large Western and American media corporations should have limited access to the fledgling communication and media systems of postcolonial countries. They argued that national cultural and communication sovereignty was integral to their broader national sovereignty and economic and social development projects. The assumption was that Western and American media corporations (and their products) would undermine or subvert the national development process of postcolonial countries by institutionalizing inappropriate media models, business practices and content. In response to the postcolonial countries&#x27; protest against media imperialism and proposal for a NWICO, the United States and United Kingdom left UNESCO.

== Key theorists and definitions ==

=== Herbert I. Schiller ===
In &quot;Mass Communication and American Empire,&quot; Herbert I. Schiller emphasized the significance of the mass media and cultural industries to American imperialism, arguing that &quot;each new electronic development widens the perimeter of American influence,&quot; and declaring that &quot;American power, expressed industrially, militarily and culturally has become the most potent force on earth and communications have become a decisive element in the extension of United States world power.&quot;

In his 1976 book &quot;Communication and Cultural Domination&quot;, Schiller conveyed the very first definition of cultural imperialism, describing it as:the sum processes by which a society is brought into the modern [U.S.-centered] world system and how its dominating stratum is attracted, pressured, forced, and sometimes bribed into shaping social institutions to correspond to, or even promote, the values and structures of the dominating centres of the system. The public media are the foremost example of operating enterprises that are used in the penetrative process. For penetration on a significant scale the media themselves must be captured by the dominating/penetrating power. This occurs largely through the commercialization of broadcasting.For Schiller, cultural imperialism refers to the American Empire’s &quot;coercive and persuasive agencies, and their capacity to promote and universalize an American ‘way of life’ in other countries without any reciprocation of influence.&quot; According to Schiller, cultural imperialism &quot;pressured, forced and bribed&quot; societies to integrate with the U.S.’s expansive capitalist model but also incorporated them with attraction and persuasion by winning &quot;the mutual consent, even solicitation of the indigenous rulers.&quot; In some ways, Schiller&#x27;s early definition of cultural imperialism is akin to Joseph Nye&#x27;s more recent idea of soft power in international relations.

The historical contexts, iterations, complexities, and politics of Schiller&#x27;s foundational and substantive theorization of cultural imperialism in international communication and media studies are discussed in detail by political economy of communication researchers Richard Maxwell, Vincent Mosco, Graham Murdock, and Tanner Mirrlees.

=== Oliver Boyd-Barrett ===
In 1977, Oliver Boyd-Barrett described media imperialism as the unequal and asymmetrical power relationship between different countries and their media systems. Boyd-Barrett defined media imperialism as &quot;a process whereby the ownership, structure, distribution or content of the media in any one country are singly or together subject to substantial pressure from the media interests of any other country or countries without proportionate reciprocation of influence by the country so affected.&quot; Boyd-Barrett emphasized how the corporations that owned the mass media in imperial countries such as the United States (but not exclusively the United States) were also exerting ownership over the mass media in smaller countries while shaping their media business &quot;models&quot;, production standards, and formats. From the late 1970s to the 2020s, Boyd-Barrett authored and edited numerous books and volumes on continuity and change in media imperialism.

=== Tom McPhail ===
In 1987, Tom McPhail defined cultural imperialism as &quot;electronic colonialism&quot;, or, &quot;the dependency relationship established by the importation of communication hardware, foreign-produced software, along with engineers, technicians, and related information protocols, that establish a set of foreign norms, values, and expectations which, in varying degrees, may alter the domestic cultures and socialization processes.&quot;

=== Paul Siu-Nam ===
In 1988, Paul Siu-Nam Lee observed that &quot;communication imperialism can be defined as the process in which the ownership and control over the hardware and software of mass media as well as other major forms of communication in one country are singly or together subjugated to the domination of another country with deleterious effects on the indigenous values, norms and culture.&quot;

=== John Downing and Annabelle Sreberny-Mohammadi ===
In 1995, John Downing and Annabelle Sreberny-Mohammadi said: &quot;Imperialism is the conquest and control of one country by a more powerful one. Cultural imperialism signifies the dimensions of the process that go beyond economic exploitation or military force. In the history of colonialism, (i.e., the form of imperialism in which the government of the colony is run directly by foreigners), the educational and media systems of many Third World countries have been set up as replicas of those in Britain, France, or the United States and carry their values. Western advertising has made further inroads, as have architectural and fashion styles. Subtly but powerfully, the message has often been insinuated that Western cultures are superior to the cultures of the Third World.&quot;

Needless to say, all these international communication and media studies researchers agree that cultural imperialism is undertaken by the world system&#x27;s dominant imperial countries with and through the available and new means of communications and mass media, and often to the detriment of the countries on the receiving end of this process.

=== Tanner Mirrlees ===
In 2016, Tanner Mirrlees redefined media imperialism in a historical study of how the US national security State partners with US-based yet globalizing media corporations to spread media and cultural goods intended to organize trans-national consent to American foreign policy. Building upon the political economy of communications scholarship of Herbert I. Schiller, Mirrlees argues that although the US government and media corporations pursue different interests on the world stage (the former, national security, and the latter, profit), they often collaborate to support the co-production and global distribution-exhibition of Empire-extolling media and popular cultural goods. Mirrlees focuses on four dimensions of media imperialism: 1. a structural alliance and symbiotic relationship between the US nation-state (pursuing its geopolitical interests in world affairs) and US-headquartered media and cultural industries (pursuing their economic interests in world markets); 2. the US nation-state&#x27;s geopolitical support for the trans-national economic dominance of the US-based media and cultural industries; 3. the US media and cultural industries&#x27; support for the US nation-state&#x27;s international propaganda, &quot;soft power&quot; and public diplomacy campaigns in other countries; and, 4. American media and cultural products whose messages and imagery is intentionally or inadvertently functional to the glorification and legitimization of the US Empire. Although Mirrlees&#x27; study focuses on the specificity of American media imperialism and the role of the media and cultural industries to US economic, military and cultural-ideological power, the four dimensions of media imperialism it identifies may be evident in the practices of other old and new imperialist powers.

=== Dal Yong Jin ===
In 2015, Dal Yong Jin extended the concept of media imperialism to encompass the growing global power of US-based Internet and social media platform corporations such as Google, Apple, Facebook. Jin argues that a handful of corporations based in &quot;Western countries are the world’s dominant digital platform owners and operators and a large number of non-Western countries are digital platform users.&quot; In the book &quot;Digital Platforms, Imperialism and Political Culture&quot;, Jin conceptualizes &quot;platform imperialism&quot; as &quot;an asymmetrical relationship of interdependence between the West, primarily the US, and many developing countries&quot;. This asymmetrical platform relationship between the United States and the rest is &quot;characterized in part by unequal technological exchanges and therefore capital flows&quot; and reflects the &quot;technological and symbolic domination of US-based platforms that have greatly influenced the majority of people and countries.&quot;

== Criticism of the theory ==

Critics of the media imperialism &quot;theory&quot; have been around since the early 1980s. Often, critics of the media imperialism theory tend to reject or deny that media imperialism exists, or alternately, present a meta-critique of one or more of the statements and claims made by the scholars associated with the media imperialism theory. As summarized by Tanner Mirrlees in &quot;Global Entertainment Media: Between Cultural Imperialism and Cultural Globalization&quot;, critics of media imperialism theory tend to make one or more of the following points when dismissing media imperialism theory or criticizing it to complicate or revise in some way: 1. The US is not an imperialist power, ergo media imperialism doesn&#x27;t exist; 2. postcolonial countries such as China and India headquarter large and internationalizing media corporations; the idea that postcolonial countries are victims of a US-centered media imperialism is simplistic and irrelevant in the 21st century; 3. the media and cultural trade relationship between the US and other countries may not be balanced, but there is more than a one way flow of media and cultural goods from the US to the rest: while the US exports a lot of media to the world, it also imports media from the world, suggesting a two-way or multi-directional flow of media goods; 4. consumers around the world are not forced or coerced to watch, listen to and read US media and cultural products; they may select and choose these &quot;foreign&quot; goods instead of &quot;domestic&quot; or nationally made and available media; 5. the texts of US media and cultural products do not communicate a one-dimensional American imperialist ideology to the world; they offer a multiplicity of competing narratives of America, warts and all; 6. the local and national reception contexts for US media and cultural products are complex, as consumers make a wide variety of interpretations of US media and sometimes adapt them to their own local and national cultural environments; 7. political and business elites in countries purportedly afflicted by US media imperialism may weaponize the concept for political ends: the censorship of unwanted or subversive ideas to maintain national propaganda regimes, the protection of fledgling or established national media corporations from international competition, and the promotion of the growth of national media oligopolies, first at home, then abroad.

==United States==
Most research on media imperialism going back to the 1970s has focused on the significance of the United States and referred to it as the world&#x27;s most significant media imperialist. For instance, media corporations based in the United States exert media influence in other countries, especially those lacking strong media industries. A major cultural influencer in other countries is television. Specifically in relation to news and entertainment American TV has a strong presence in the international arena. American news networks like CNN often have large international staffs, and produce specialized regional programming for many nations.

Movies produced by major Hollywood studios and distributors have presence and popularity around the world. For example, Hollywood is a major producer of films, which tend to be high quality and are released internationally. Hollywood relies on four capitalist strategies &quot;to attract and integrate non-US film producers, exhibitors and audiences into its ambit: ownership, cross-border productions with subordinate service providers, content licensing deals with exhibitors, and blockbusters designed to travel the globe.&quot; Hollywood&#x27;s dominance is not total, as other countries have their own film industries: &quot;Bollywood&quot;, for example, describes India&#x27;s Hindi-language film industry, which is large and prosperous.

Another form of mass media used for media imperialism is music. Much of today&#x27;s, and older, American music finds itself popular in other countries. However, in the &quot;British Invasion&quot; of the 1960s, British music became popular in the United States. Since then, there has not been such a large shift of imperialism.

Overall, American media imperialism can be seen as a positive and a negative. Negative views towards it stem from the negative connotation of the word &#x27;imperialism&#x27;. This word is associated with political imperialism, in which a large country creates an empire out of smaller ones. However, media imperialism can be seen as a positive when it is viewed as a way to create a consensus narrative. A consensus narrative is a result of &quot;products that provide us with shared experiences&quot;. By having similar experiences, it opens the gateway for communication and development of relationships. Yet, this can also become a problem when the cultural exchange is not balanced or reciprocated. American culture is being transmitted to other countries, but other cultures may not be received in return.

<doc id="206269" wikidata="Q1571520" url="?curid=206269" title="Vertical integration">
<text>In microeconomics, management and international political economy, vertical integration, also referred to as vertical consolidation, is an arrangement in which the supply chain of a company is integrated and owned by that company. Usually each member of the supply chain produces a different product or (market-specific) service, and the products combine to satisfy a common need. It contrasts with horizontal integration, wherein a company produces several items that are related to one another. Vertical integration has also described management styles that bring large portions of the supply chain not only under a common ownership but also into one corporation (as in the 1920s when the Ford River Rouge complex began making much of its own steel rather than buying it from suppliers).

Vertical integration can be desirable because it secures supplies needed by the firm to produce its product and the market needed to sell the product, but it can become undesirable when a firm&#x27;s actions become anti-competitive and impede free competition in an open marketplace. Vertical integration is one method of avoiding the hold-up problem. A monopoly produced through vertical integration is called a &quot;vertical monopoly&quot;: &quot;vertical&quot; in a supply chain measures a firm&#x27;s distance from the final consumers; for example, a firm that sells directly to the consumers has a vertical position of 0, a firm that supplies to this firm has a vertical position of 1, and so on.

==Vertical expansion==
Vertical integration is often closely associated with vertical expansion which, in economics, is the growth of a business enterprise through the acquisition of companies that produce the intermediate goods needed by the business or help market and distribute its product. A firm may desire such expansion to secure the supplies needed by the firm to produce its product and the market needed to sell the product. Such expansion can become undesirable from a system-wide perspective when it becomes anti-competitive and impede free competition in an open marketplace.

The result is a more efficient business with lower costs and more profits. On the undesirable side, when vertical expansion leads toward monopolistic control of a product or service then regulative action may be required to rectify anti-competitive behavior. Related to vertical expansion is lateral expansion, which is the growth of a business enterprise through the acquisition of similar firms, in the hope of achieving economies of scale.

Vertical expansion is also known as a vertical acquisition. Vertical expansion or acquisitions can also be used to increase sales and to gain market power. The acquisition of DirecTV by News Corporation is an example of forwarding vertical expansion or acquisition. DirecTV is a satellite TV company through which News Corporation can distribute more of its media content: news, movies, and television shows. The acquisition of NBC by Comcast is an example of backward vertical integration. For example, in the United States, protecting the public from communications monopolies that can be built in this way is one of the missions of the Federal Communications Commission.

Scholars&#x27; findings suggest that a reduction in inefficiencies caused by the market vertical value chains, including downstream prices or double mark-up, can be negated with vertical integration. Application in more complex environments can help firms overcome market failures (markets with high transaction costs or assets specificities) Scholars also identified potential risks and boundaries which may occur under vertical integration. This includes the potential competitor, the enhancements to horizontal collusion, and development of barriers to entry. However, it is still debated over if vertical integration expected efficiencies can lead to competitive harm to the market. Some conclude that in many cases that the efficiencies outweigh the potential risks.

==Three types of vertical integration==
Contrary to horizontal integration, which is a consolidation of many firms that handle the same part of the production process, vertical integration is typified by one firm engaged in different parts of production (e.g., growing raw materials, manufacturing, transporting, marketing, and/or retailing). Vertical integration is the degree to which a firm owns its upstream suppliers and its downstream buyers. The differences depend on where the firm is placed in the order of the supply chain. There are three varieties of vertical integration: backward (upstream) vertical integration, forward (downstream) vertical integration, and balanced (both upstream and downstream) vertical integration.

* Backward vertical integration: A company exhibits backward vertical integration when it controls subsidiaries that produce some of the inputs used in the production of its products. For example, an automobile company may own a tire company, a glass company, and a metal company. Control of these three subsidiaries is intended to create a stable supply of inputs and ensure consistent quality in their final product. It was the main business approach of Ford and other car companies in the 1920s, who sought to minimize costs by integrating the production of cars and car parts, as exemplified in the Ford River Rouge Complex. This type of integration also makes the barriers to entry into an industry more difficult. The control of subsidiaries that produce the raw materials needed in the production process gives a company the power to refuse access to resources to competitors and new entrants. They have the ability to cut off the chain of supply for competing buyers and thus, strengthen their position in their respective industry.
* Forward vertical integration: A company tends toward forward vertical integration when it controls distribution centers and retailers where its products are sold. An example is a brewing company that owns and controls a number of bars or pubs. Unlike backward vertical integration, which serves to reduce costs of production, forward vertical integration allows a company to decrease its costs of distribution. This includes avoiding paying taxes for exchanges between stages in the chain of production, bypassing other price regulations, and removing the need for intermediary markets. In addition, a company has the power to refuse to support sales of competing distribution centers and retailers. Similar to backward vertical integration, this ability increases the barriers to entry into an industry.
* Balanced vertical integration: A company demonstrates balanced vertical integration when it practices both backward vertical integration and forward vertical integration. Accomplishing this gives a company authority over the entire production and distribution process of a given product. A product that is produced in an integrated company as such exemplifies the result of a cost-efficient manufacture

Disintermediation is a form of vertical integration when purchasing departments take over the former role of wholesalers to source products.

For vertical integration to succeed, managers must be able to adapt their managerial approach to compliment the changes in functional activities that their vertical shift accompanies. Managers should make sure that their firm can take advantage of existing functional knowledge through organisation, and simultaneously allow new functional knowledge to develop. However, environmental possibilities can be a factor in determining whether vertical integration is successful.

==Influence factors of vertical integration==

*Technology : the probability of vertical integration between the two industries is less likely when the supply industry is more technology-intensive and the production industry is less technology-intensive. In addition, the impact of these factors is greater when inputs from the supply industry represent a large proportion of the total costs incurred by the production industry.
*Switching cost and product differentiation : based on a new insight that pricing incentive choice of a downstream producer may change by vertical integration, downstream firms are more likely to switch to a different supplier if the investment by firms in a particular relationship is low, or if the input market is similar to the spot market. In this case, vertical M&amp;A is more likely to have a positive impact on consumers. However, if supplier switching costs are high, the impact of a vertical integration on consumers depends on the degree of downstream product differentiation. If the downstream product is significantly differentiated, vertical integration is more likely beneficial to consumers. In contrast, if the downstream products are close substitutes, vertical integration is likely to harm consumers.

==Problems and benefits==
There are many problems and benefits that vertical integration brings to an economic system. Problems that can stem from vertical integration can include large capital investments needed to set up and buy factories and maintain efficient profits. Rapid technology development can increase integration difficulties and further increase costs. The requirement of different business skills venturing into new portions of the supply chain can be challenging for the firm. Another problem that may stem from vertical integration is the collapse of goals among the various firms in a supply chain. With each firm operating under different systems, integration may cause initial problems in management and production. Vertical integration also proves to be dangerous when monopolistic problems arise in a capitalistic economy. When this happens, competition is removed and a corporation has the power to control all firms in its supply chain.

One benefit is that the implementation of vertical integration can yield increased profit margins or eliminate the leverage that other firms or buyers may have over the firm. It allows improved coordination between production and distribution firms and decreases the cost of exchange of goods between firms within a supply chain. Operational routines also become more consistent and certain as the management of these firms gradually merge. Vertically integrated firms rarely need to worry about the sufficiency in their supply of materials because they generally control the facilities that provide them. A vertically integrated company also creates high barriers of entry into their respective economy, eliminating most potential competition. Implementing vertical integration can be beneficial in that it reduces the distance that separates the suppliers and customers from the resources or information, which can then boost profits and efficiency.

There are internal and external society-wide gains and losses stemming from vertical integration, which vary according to the state of technology in the industries involved, roughly corresponding to the stages of the industry lifecycle.[&quot;&quot;][&quot;&quot;] Static technology represents the simplest case, where the gains and losses have been studied extensively.[&quot;&quot;] A vertically integrated company usually fails when transactions within the market are too risky or the contracts to support these risks are too costly to administer, such as frequent transactions and a small number of buyers and sellers.

===Internal gains===
*Lower transaction costs
*Synchronization of supply and demand along the chain of products
*Lower uncertainty and higher investment
*Capture of profit margins from upstream or downstream
*Ability to monopolize market throughout the chain by market foreclosure
*Strategic independence (especially if important inputs are rare or highly volatile in price, such as rare-earth metals).
*Enhancing the company&#x27;s ties with its suppliers
*Lower the threshold for entry. A sustained high surplus phase must be protected by barriers to entry. As a result, a vertically integrated entrant is able to extend these barriers at a lower cost than the value of existing surpluses.

===Internal losses===

*Higher monetary and organizational costs of switching to other suppliers/buyers
*Weaker motivation for good performance at the start of the supply chain since sales are guaranteed and poor quality may be blended into other inputs at later manufacturing stages
*Specific investment, capacity balancing issue 
*Developing new business competencies can compromise on existing competencies
*Conflicts in inventory management post-integration
*Demand uncertainty may increase due to inventory instability
*Assigning limited purchasing resources among the suppliers as well as the production of goods or services

===Benefits to society===
* Better opportunities for investment growth through reduced uncertainty
* Local companies are often better positioned against foreign competition
* Lower consumer prices by reducing markup from intermediaries
*Accomplishing the maximum profits for selling products or services.

===Losses to society===
*Monopolization of markets
*Rigid organizational structure
*Manipulation of prices (if market power is established)
*Loss of tax revenue as fewer intermediary transactions are made.

==Selected examples==
The following are several case studies of vertical integration in play. Many examples center around American industries, where major companies like General Foods, Carnegie Steel Company, the Bell System, Apple, the U.S. entertainment studios, the U.S. meat industry, Ford Motor Company, CVS, and Amazon demonstrate vertical merging. Other examples like Alibaba and EssilorLuxottica cover vertical integration in other nations.

=== Birdseye ===

During a hunting trip American explorer and scientist Clarence Birdseye discovered the beneficial effects of &quot;quick-freezing&quot;. For example, fish caught a few days previously that were kept in ice remained in perfect condition.

In 1924, Clarence Birdseye patented the &quot;Birdseye Plate Froster&quot; and established the General Seafood Corporation. In 1929, Birdseye&#x27;s company and the patent were bought by Postum Cereals and Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation. It was later known as General Foods. They kept the Birdseye name, which was split into two words (Birds eye) for use as a trademark. Birdseye was paid $20 million for the patents and $2 million for the assets.

Birds Eye was one of the pioneers in the frozen food industry. During these times, there was not a well-developed infrastructure to produce and sell frozen foods. Hence Birds Eye developed its own system by using vertical integration. Members of the supply chain, such as farmers and small food retailers, could not afford the high cost of equipment, so Birdseye provided it to them.

Until now, Birds Eye has faded slowly because they have fixed costs associated with vertical integration, such as property, plants, and equipment that cannot be reduced significantly when production needs decrease. The Birds Eye company used vertical integration to create a larger organization structure with more levels of command. This produced a slower information processing rate, with the side effect of making the company so slow that it could not react quickly. Birds Eye did not take advantage of the growth of supermarkets until ten years after the competition did. The already-developed infrastructure did not allow Birdseye to quickly react to market changes.

===Alibaba===

In order to increase profits and gain more market share, Alibaba, a China-based company, has implemented vertical integration deepening its company holdings to more than the e-commerce platform. Alibaba has built its leadership in the market by gradually acquiring complementary companies in a variety of industries including delivery and payments.

===Steel and oil===
One of the earliest, largest and most famous examples of vertical integration was the Carnegie Steel company. The company controlled not only the mills where the steel was made, but also the mines where the iron ore was extracted, the coal mines that supplied the coal, the ships that transported the iron ore and the railroads that transported the coal to the factory, the coke ovens where the coal was coked, etc. The company focused heavily on developing talent internally from the bottom up, rather than importing it from other companies. Later, Carnegie established an institute of higher learning to teach the steel processes to the next generation.

Oil companies, both multinational (such as ExxonMobil, Shell, ConocoPhillips or BP) and national (e.g., Petronas) often adopt a vertically integrated structure, meaning that they are active along the entire supply chain from locating deposits, drilling and extracting crude oil, transporting it around the world, refining it into petroleum products such as petrol/gasoline, to distributing the fuel to company-owned retail stations, for sale to consumers. Standard Oil is a famous example of both horizontal and vertical integration, combining extraction, transport, refinement, wholesale distribution, and retail sales at company-owned gas stations.

===Telecommunications and computing===
Telephone companies in most of the 20th century, especially the largest (the Bell System) were integrated, making their own telephones, telephone cables, telephone exchange equipment and other supplies. The Bell System is an example of an industry in which without vertical integration, would not be able to develop efficiently. In order to implement a telecommunications system that connected cities across a nation reliably, vertical integration was called upon. This strategic move ensured that the wiring, manufacture, and management of the system was consistent and functional across a state.

===Apple===
Apple has used the vertical integration strategy for 35 years and is one of the most successful companies in the technology industry. Apple centered its business strategy on its own development of integrated hardware, software, and latterly services. They design most of their products in-house, and do not allow their hardware and operating system to be licensed out, which allows the company to apply its company vision to its products.

Large companies such as Apple are more likely than smaller companies to employ vertical integration, as they have more resources to manage each stage of production (e.g. major expansion and funding). Implementing a vertically integrated strategy has helped Apple become a leading platform company; integrating their software (through APIs for third-party application developers) with their own hardware, across all the devices and services they offer.

Vertical integration allows Apple to control production from beginning to end. Other companies may follow the Apple model, but may not see success for some time, both due to the cost of entering the market and taking on the currently successful incumbent, but also by innovating their products to make them more appealing in the marketplace than the current incumbent. Vertical integration requires a company to focus not only on its core business, but also on several difficult areas such as sourcing materials and manufacturing partners, distribution, and finally selling the product.

Another major success of Apple&#x27;s, is the forward integration with their retail stores, allowing them to sell their products directly to customers (helping customers to buy and use Apple&#x27;s products and services), additionally helping them to control the prices of their products, and thus to maintain high-profit margins when they do. Apple is also known as one of the world&#x27;s leading &quot;orchestrators&quot; as they exert control over the entire value chain, but do not do everything in-house (e.g. assembly of iPhones by manufacturing partner Foxconn).

===Entertainment===
From the early 1920s through the early 1950s, the American motion picture had evolved into an industry controlled by a few companies, a condition known as a &quot;mature oligopoly&quot;, as it was led by eight major film studios, the most powerful of which were the &quot;Big Five&quot; studios: MGM, Warner Brothers, 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, and RKO. These studios were fully integrated, not only producing and distributing films, but also operating their own movie theaters; the &quot;Little Three&quot;, Universal Studios, Columbia Pictures, and United Artists, produced and distributed feature films but did not own theaters.

The issue of vertical integration (also known as common ownership) has been the main focus of policy makers because of the possibility of anti-competitive behaviors affiliated with market influence. For example, in &quot;United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.&quot;, the Supreme Court ordered the five vertically integrated studios to sell off their theater chains and all trade practices were prohibited (&quot;United States v. Paramount Pictures&quot;, Inc., 1948). The prevalence of vertical integration wholly predetermined the relationships between both studios and networks and modified criteria in financing. Networks began arranging content initiated by commonly owned studios and stipulated a portion of the syndication revenues in order for a show to gain a spot on the schedule if it was produced by a studio without common ownership. In response, the studios fundamentally changed the way they made movies and did business. Lacking the financial resources and contract talent they once controlled, the studios now relied on independent producers supplying some portion of the budget in exchange for distribution rights.

Certain media conglomerates may, in a similar manner, own television broadcasters (either over-the-air or on cable), production companies that produce content for their networks, and also own the services that distribute their content to viewers (such as television and internet service providers). AT&amp;T, Bell Canada, Comcast, Sky plc, and Rogers Communications are vertically integrated in such a manneroperating media subsidiaries (such as WarnerMedia, Bell Media, NBCUniversal, and Rogers Media), and provide &quot;triple play&quot; services of television, internet, and phone service in some markets (such as Bell Satellite TV/Bell Internet, Rogers Cable, Xfinity, and Sky&#x27;s satellite TV and internet services). Additionally, Bell and Rogers own wireless providers, Bell Mobility and Rogers Wireless, while Comcast is partnered with Verizon Wireless for an Xfinity-branded MVNO. Similarly, Sony has media holdings through its Sony Pictures division, including film and television content, as well as television channels, but is also a manufacturer of consumer electronics that can be used to play content from itself and others, including televisions, phones, and PlayStation video game consoles. AT&amp;T is the first ever vertical integration where a mobile phone company and a film studio company are under same umbrella.

===Agriculture===

Vertical integration through production and marketing contracts have also become the dominant model for livestock production. Currently, 90% of poultry, 69% of hogs, and 29% of cattle are contractually produced through vertical integration. The USDA supports vertical integration because it has increased food productivity. However, &quot;... contractors receive a large share of farm receipts, formerly assumed to go to the operator&#x27;s family&quot;.

Under production contracts, growers raise animals owned by integrators. Farm contracts contain detailed conditions for growers, who are paid based on how efficiently they use feed, provided by the integrator, to raise the animals. The contract dictates how to construct the facilities, how to feed, house, and medicate the animals, and how to handle manure and dispose of carcasses. Generally, the contract also shields the integrator from liability. Jim Hightower, in his book, &quot;Eat Your Heart Out&quot;, discusses this liability role enacted by large food companies. He finds that in many cases of agricultural vertical integration, the integrator (food company) denies the farmer the right of entrepreneurship. This means that the farmer can only sell &quot;under&quot; and &quot;to&quot; the integrator. These restrictions on specified growth, Hightower argues, strips the selling and producing power of the farmer. The producer is ultimately limited by the established standards of the integrator. Yet, at the same time, the integrator still keeps the responsibility connected to the farmer. Hightower sees this as ownership without reliability.

Under marketing contracts, growers agree in advance to sell their animals to integrators under an agreed price system. Generally, these contracts shield the integrator from liability for the grower&#x27;s actions and the only negotiable item is a price.

===Automotive industry===
In the United States new automobiles can not be sold at dealerships owned by the same company that produced them but are protected by state franchise laws.

Ford Motor Company vertically integrated due to high demand for their Model T automobile. With the development of Model T, the company required a system in which mass production was most efficient. The model called for the manufacture of additional devices, all of which had carefully-curated designs by Ford engineers. Instead of passing these instructions and duties off to external manufacture firms, vertical integration was exercised within the corporation. This allowed for manageable division of labor, decreased costs in delay and exchange of goods, and organized updates of each firm in the supply chain. Vertical integration enabled Ford Motor Company to be self-regulating and self-sufficient.

===Eyewear===
EssilorLuxottica, the company that merged with Essilor and Luxottica, occupies up to 30% of the global market share as well as representing billions of pairs of lenses and frames sold annually. Before the merger, Luxottica also owned 80% of the market share of companies that produce corrective and protective eyewear as well as owning many retailers, optical departments at Target and Sears, and key eye insurance groups, such as EyeMed, many of which are already part of the now merged company.

===Health care===
Within healthcare systems, horizontal integration is generally much more prominent. However, in the United States, major vertical mergers have included CVS Health&#x27;s purchase of Aetna, and Cigna&#x27;s purchase of Express Scripts. The integration of CVS Health and Aetna resulted in the combination of one of the nation&#x27;s largest health insurance companies with a pharmaceutical company seen all across the U.S. The vertical merge allowed CVS-Aetna to regulate more of the healthcare and delivery chain and gave them the ability to provide higher quality care to consumers. One of the most significant advantages to this integration is the reduction in costs for healthcare.

===General retail===
Amazon.com has been criticized for being anti-competitive as both an owner and participant of its dominant online marketplace. In office products, Sycamore Partners owns both Staples, Inc., a major retailer, and Essendant, a dominant wholesaler.

=== Electric utilities ===
Before a wave of deregulation at the end of 20th century, most electric utilities were vertically integrated and provided electric generation, transmission, distribution, and sales. These were not just conglomerates with a common accounting department: there was just one profit center in sales, and costs of transmission and distribution were not separated. Partial deregulation in the US in 1978 (PURPA) forced the utilities to buy electricity outside if the rates were competitive; this gave rise to independent power producers. The other deviation from the vertical integration model were local distribution companies in some towns and regions. In the US 250 vertically integrated companies provided 85% of electrical generation. As of 2022, this &quot;public utility&quot; model was still utilized in some US states, mostly in the Mountain West, Great Plains, and Southeast.

==Economic theory==
An economic theory is a framework that defines how a particular economic system functions. Economists develop principles in which an economy adheres to, which provides insight onto the relationships between economic events, markets, companies, and the government. In economic theory, vertical integration has been studied in the literature on incomplete contracts that was developed by Oliver Hart and his coauthors. Consider a seller of an intermediate product that is used by a buyer to produce a final product. The intermediate product can only be produced with the help of specific physical assets (e.g., machines, buildings). Should the buyer own the assets (vertical integration) or should the seller own the assets (non-integration)? Suppose that today the parties have to make relationship-specific investments. Since today complete contracts cannot be written, the two parties will negotiate tomorrow about how to divide the returns of the investments. Since the owner is in a better bargaining position, he will have stronger incentives to invest. Hence, whether vertical integration is desirable or not depends on whose investments are more important. Hart&#x27;s theory has been extended by several authors. For instance, DeMeza and Lockwood (1998) have studied different bargaining games, while Schmitz (2006) has introduced asymmetric information into the incomplete contracting setup. In these extended models, vertical integration can sometimes be optimal even if only the seller has to make an investment decision.

<text>Mare Fecunditatis (Latin &quot;fēcunditātis&quot;, the &quot;Sea of Fecundity&quot; or &quot;Sea of Fertility&quot;) is a lunar mare in the eastern half of the visible Moon. The mare has a maximum diameter of 840 km.

==Description==
The Fecunditatis basin formed in the Pre-Nectarian epoch, while the basin material surrounding the mare is of the subsequent Nectarian epoch. The mare material is of the Upper Imbrian epoch and is relatively thin compared to the neighboring Mare Crisium or Mare Tranquillitatis. This basin is overlapped with the Nectaris, Tranquillitatis, and Crisium basins. Fecunditatis basin meets Nectaris basin along Fecunditatis&#x27; western edge, with the area along this zone faulted by arcuated grabens. On the eastern edge of Fecunditatis is the crater Langrenus. Near the center lie the interesting craters Messier and Messier A. It was here that the first automated sample return took place via the Luna 16 probe, in September 1970. Sinus Successus lies along the eastern edge of the mare.

Unlike many other maria, there is no mass concentration (mascon), or gravitational high, in the center of Mare Fecunditatis. Mascons were identified in the center of other maria (such as Serenitatis or Imbrium) from Doppler tracking of the five Lunar Orbiter spacecraft in 1968. The gravity field was mapped at higher resolution with later orbiters such as Lunar Prospector and GRAIL, which unveiled an irregular pattern.

<text>Conservation status is a measure used in conservation biology to assess an ecoregion&#x27;s degree of habitat alteration and habitat conservation. It is used to set priorities for conservation.

Ecoregion Conservation Status refers to the assessment and categorization of the ecological health, biodiversity, and threats faced by distinct geographic areas. This assessment plays a crucial role in setting priorities for conservation efforts.  An ecoregion, characterized by a combination of climate, geology, topography, and ecosystems, embodies unique natural landscapes and is assessed based on the criteria of habitat loss, fragmentation, and protection. The goal of ecoregion conservation is to acknowledge all private and public conservation areas that safeguard the full biological diversity of an ecoregion. The evaluation of such criteria puts the classification of ecoregions into various categories to inform the need for conservation interventions. This status of ecoregions is necessary for early warning signs, to identify struggling regions before the large loss of biodiversity. This also develops initiatives aimed at sustainable living to enhance all ecoregions in the world.
Key contributors to research towards conservation efforts of ecoregions include The International Union for Conservation of Nature (ICUN) and The World Wildlife Fund (WWF), as well as many others.

== Manner of Application ==

=== The Word Wildlife Fund ===

The WWF contributed to The Global 200, a catalog of high-priority ecoregions and their conservation scale. Ecoregions are broadly classified into three categories: “critical/endangered” (CE), “Vulnerable” (V), or “relatively stable/relatively intact” (RS).

* Critical/Endangered: Facing severe threats, these areas are at high risk of ecological degradation. Urgent assistance is imperative to address issues that include severe rates of deforestation, habitat fragmentation, and loss of biodiversity.
* Vulnerable: With the potential for significant loss of biodiversity, these areas require conservation efforts. They face moderate levels of habitat and biodiversity loss, as well as the potential encroachment of invasive species
* Stable/Intact: These areas are in relatively good health, showing signs of well-preserved and thriving biodiversity, with minimal habitat loss. While these ecoregions require monitoring, immediate intervention is not needed.

The selection process for the Global 200 is tedious and thorough. The categorization process is extensive and takes into account things like habitat loss, impacts of global warming, and overall biodiversity in each ecoregion. This placement then tells conservationists which section of the world needs attention the most at that specific time. This can help migratory species and help identify invasive species&#x27; origin and combat negative impacts on these environments. 

* Habitat blocks measures of the size of remaining habitat blocks
* Habitat fragmentation is the degree to which remaining habitat is fragmented, measured as the ratio of the total perimeter of remaining habitat blocks to their total area
* Habitat protection measures the area of remaining habitat in protected areas, and the degree of protection provided (IUCN protected area categories)

=== The International Union for Conservation Nature ===
The ICUN compiled the “Red List”, evaluating the global conservation status of species based on the threat level. The list separates species into threat levels ranging from least concern to extinct, aiding in directing efforts to mitigate species decline This assessment evaluated factors contributing to species extinction like population size, trends, distributions, and threats. This list gives great insight into what the ecoregion conservation status is used for, placing ecoregions into categories inherently explains the failing ecosystem and corresponds to specific species of concern within it. 

=== The Nature Conservancy ===
The Nature Conservancy employs a developed strategy for assessing the status of ecoregions in need, via the 5-s Framework. This involves evaluating systems, stresses, and sources of stress, to understand the fall of the ecosystem. Furthermore, categories of success and sources of success are utilized to gauge the pace of improvement This method of framework aids in identifying conservation targets, understanding degradation, and continuing with effective strategies for the rehabilitation of falling ecoregions. 

* Systems: conversation target in a system along with the process to maintain 
* Stresses: type of degradation or impairment at a site 
* Sources: the agent bringing stress to the system 
* Strategies: conservation tactics deployed to help render rehabilitation 
* Success: a measure of biodiversity health at the site

=== Ecoregion Conservation Status Example ===

The Brazilian Cerrado biome is a large ecosystem that can be split into 19 ecoregions, that spans over central Brazil and is home to many animals as well as over 12,000 plant species. The increasing necessity of agricultural land has caused issues for the Central American savannah, causing heavy amounts of chemical fertilizers into the soil. These actions have caused fragmentation, invasive species, soil erosion, water pollution, and loss of biodiversity. By accessing the decline of vegetation, soil, geology, and biodiversity, many of the ecoregions were scaled into vulnerable and critical classifications, creating a high-priority necessity for conservation intervention. Scientists recently reformatted some of the ecoregion delineations in hopes of creating a more precise plan of action to combat the necessary agricultural progress but the harmful output of dangerous pollution.

<text>Mare Frigoris (Latin &quot;frīgōris&quot;, the &quot;Sea of Cold&quot;) is a lunar mare in the far north of the Moon. It is located in the outer rings of the Procellarum basin, just north of Mare Imbrium, and stretches east to north of Mare Serenitatis. It is just north of the dark crater Plato.

The basin material surrounding the mare is of the Lower Imbrian epoch, while the eastern mare material is of the Upper Imbrian epoch, and the western mare material is of the Eratosthenian epoch.
Like most of the other maria on the Moon, Mare Frigoris was named by Giovanni Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized. Previously, William Gilbert had included it among the Insula Borealis (&quot;Northern Island&quot;) in his map of &quot;c&quot;.1600, and Michael van Langren had labelled it the Mare Astronomicum (&quot;Sea of Astronomy&quot;) in his 1645 map. Pierre Gassendi called it the Boreum Mare (&#x27;Northern Sea&#x27;).

==In popular culture==

This area of the Moon featured prominently in &#x27;Behemoth&#x27;, the second episode of the 1973 BBC science fiction mini-series &quot;Moonbase 3&quot;.

Mare Frigoris was intended to be the original landing site of the fictionalised version of Apollo 15 in the Apple TV+ series For All Mankind, although in the show the crew decided last minute to divert the landing to Shackleton crater in the Lunar south pole upon finding out there is a high concentration of water ice in the area (a discovery not made in reality until the 1990s).

<doc id="206281" wikidata="Q168398" url="?curid=206281" title="Mare Humboldtianum">
<text>Mare Humboldtianum (Latin &quot;humboldtiānum&quot;, the &quot;Sea of Alexander von Humboldt&quot;) is a lunar mare located just to the east of Mare Frigoris, in the center of Humboldtianum basin. It is located along the northeastern limb of the Moon, and continues on to the far side. Due to its location, the visibility of this feature can be affected by libration, and on occasion it can be hidden from view from Earth.

The basin material is of the Nectarian epoch, with the mare material being of the Upper Imbrian epoch (3.4–3.7 Ga). The lighter gray area to the southeast of the dark mare material is a region of hills within the basin. The rim of this basin forms a mountain range that can be seen under oblique lighting conditions.

This mare is centered at 56.9° N, 81.5° E, and its maximal size is 230 km. However the surrounding basin extends for a diameter of over 600 km. The walled plain Bel&#x27;kovich spills over the northwestern portion of Mare Humboldtianum, and the flooded crater Bel&#x27;kovich A lies across the southwestern rim of Bel&#x27;kovich and part of the floor of the mare.

At the center of the Humboldtianum basin is a mascon, or gravitational high. The mascon was first identified by Doppler tracking of the Lunar Prospector spacecraft.

This mare is situated between near (visible) and far sides of the Moon, like a link between known and unknown. That&#x27;s why Johann Mädler named it after Alexander von Humboldt, a prominent explorer of unknown lands. It is one of only two lunar maria that are named after people, the other being Mare Smythii (named after British astronomer William Henry Smyth) which is located along the eastern lunar limb.

<text>Mare Insularum (Latin &quot;īnsulārum&quot;, the &quot;sea of islands&quot;) is a lunar mare located in the Insularum basin just south of the western Mare Imbrium. The basin material is of the Lower Imbrian epoch, with the mare material of the Upper Imbrian epoch. The mare is bordered by the craters Copernicus on the east, and Kepler on the west. Oceanus Procellarum joins the mare to the southwest.

Copernicus is one of the most noticeable craters on the Moon. The rays from both Kepler and Copernicus protrude into the mare. It is located near the crater Fra Mauro, the site of the Apollo 14 landing. Sinus Aestuum forms a northeastern extension to the mare.

The name was suggested by lunar geologist Don E. Wilhelms.

<text>Mare Marginis (Latin for &#x27;Sea of the Edge&#x27;); ) is a lunar mare that lies on the very edge of the lunar nearside. The selenographic coordinates of this feature are 13.3° N, 86.1° E, and the diameter is 358 km.

This mare differs from most of the nearside maria; it has an irregular outline and it appears to be fairly thin. It has small circular and elongated features in the mare plains that 
probably mark impact craters buried by less than 1000 to 1700 feet (300 to 500 m) of lava. Further, Mare Marginis is not centered on any clear, large impact basin. Thus, Mare Marginis seems to mark a low-lying region of the highlands where mare lavas were just able to reach the surface. Several large mare-floored craters also occur nearby. In these craters, the crater floors lie below the surrounding highland surface. Thus, they mark sites around Mare Marginis where lavas were close to the lunar surface. The major crater to the north of Marginis is Al-Biruni, with Ibn Yunus to the southeast and Goddard to the northwest.

The surface of this mare displays some lunar swirls; higher albedo deposits that are similar to the Reiner Gamma feature on the Oceanus Procellarum. This feature is associated with a relatively strong magnetic field. It is also located at the antipode of the Mare Orientale impact basin, and may be associated with the formation of that feature. Other possible explanations for the formation include a cometary impact, venting of volcanic gases, or just normal surface markings that are shielded from space weathering due to the magnetic field. But the exact cause of albedo features such as this are not completely understood.

<text>; ) is a lunar mare that sits in the Moscoviense basin. It is one of the very few maria on the far side of the Moon.

== Geology ==
Like Mare Marginis, this mare appears to be fairly thin. However, it is clearly centered within a large impact basin. It is also much lower than either the outer basin floor or the farside highlands.

The great depth of this mare beneath the nearby highlands probably explains why mare units are so rare on the lunar farside. Very few basins on the farside were deep enough to allow mare volcanism. Thus, while large impact basins are found on both the nearside and farside, large maria are mostly found on the nearside. Mare lavas apparently could reach the surface more often and more easily there. The basin material is of the Nectarian epoch, while the mare material is of the Upper Imbrian epoch. Following the SELENE mission, scientists proposed that volcanism in Mare Moscoviense was active for at least ~1.5 Ga following the formation of the Moscoviense basin, but the formation of the mare as the result of a meteorite cluster impact, rather than from volcanism, has also been proposed based on the energy required to melt the lava in Mare Moscoviense.

At the center of the basin (or the southwest portion of the mare) is a mascon, or gravitational high. The mascon was first identified by Doppler tracking of the Lunar Prospector spacecraft.

== Name ==
The name Mare Moscoviense was approved by the IAU in 1961. It is Latin for &quot;sea of Muscovy&quot;.

Lunar naming conventions specify that lunar maria are named in Latin after &#x27;weather and other abstract concepts&#x27;, with a few exceptions. Mare Moscoviense was discovered in 1959, when the first images of the far side were returned by the Soviet spacecraft Luna 3. The name was proposed by the Soviet Union, but was only accepted by the International Astronomical Union when Audouin Dollfus argued that Moscow is a state of mind.

According to one NASA website, the region was named . This is probably a typo for .

<text>Mare Nectaris (Latin &quot;nectaris&quot;, the &quot;Sea of Nectar&quot;) is a small lunar mare or sea (a volcanic lava plain noticeably darker than the rest of the Moon&#x27;s surface) located south of Mare Tranquillitatis southwest of Mare Fecunditatis, on the near side of the Moon. Montes Pyrenaeus borders the mare to the east and Sinus Asperitatis fuses to its northwestern edge. It is 84,000 square kilometers in size.

Several large craters are situated at the borders of Mare Nectaris. The biggest one is lava-filled Fracastorius (124 km), which fuses with the southern coast of the Sea. A prominent trio of 100-km craters Theophilus, Cyrillus and Catharina is located near northwestern coast. Other notable feature is a &quot;ghost crater&quot; Daguerre, almost entirely covered with lava, in the northern part of Mare Nectaris.

Mare Nectaris is located in the central part of 860-km-diameter impact basin, which was formed 3.8–3.9 billion years ago. This event marks the beginning of Nectarian period of the lunar geologic timescale. The best-preserved part of the rim of this basin is called Rupes Altai, in the southwest part of the basin.

Lava filling of Mare Nectaris is younger than the basin itself. The mare material is approximately 1000m in depth, and mainly of the Nectarian period and the Lower Imbrian epoch, with the mare material of the Upper Imbrian epoch. The crater Theophilus on the northeastern side of the mare is of the Eratosthenian period. Thus, the crater is younger than the mare to its southeast. Enough subsidence has occurred to open a few arcuate grabens on the western margin of the mare.

A mass concentration (mascon), or gravitational high, was identified in the center of Mare Nectaris from Doppler tracking of the five Lunar Orbiter spacecraft in 1968. The mascon was confirmed and mapped at higher resolution with later orbiters such as Lunar Prospector and GRAIL.

<text>Mare Nubium (Latin &quot;nūbium&quot;, the &quot;sea of clouds&quot;) is a lunar mare in the Nubium basin on the Moon&#x27;s near side. The mare is located just to the southeast of Oceanus Procellarum.

==Formation==
The basin containing Mare Nubium is believed to have been part of the Pre-Nectarian system. The mare material is of the Imbrian and Eratosthenian age. 

Bullialdus crater, a prominent feature on the west side of the mare, is of Eratosthenian age. Other features within the mare include Pitatus on the southern margin and Guericke bounding the mare to the north. Opelt, Gould, Kies, Nicollet, Wolf, Birt, and Rupes Recta (the Straight Wall) lie within the mare.

==Names==
Like most of the other maria on the Moon, Mare Nubium was named by Giovanni Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized. Previously, William Gilbert had included it among the Continens Meridionalis (&quot;Southern Continent&quot;) in his map of &quot;c&quot;.1600, and Michael van Langren had labelled it the Mare Borbonicum (after the House of Bourbon) in his 1645 map.

==Exploration==
The first released images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2009 were of the lunar highlands 200 km south of Mare Nubium.

==News==
In September 2013, Spanish astronomers observed and recorded an impact event when a large rock hit the lunar surface in Mare Nubium.

<text>Mare Serenitatis (Latin &quot;serēnitātis&quot;, the &quot;Sea of Serenity&quot;) is a lunar mare located to the east of Mare Imbrium on the Moon. Its diameter is .

==Geology==

Mare Serenitatis is located within the Serenitatis basin, which is of the Nectarian epoch. The material surrounding the mare is of the Lower Imbrian epoch, while the mare material is of the Upper Imbrian epoch. The mare basalt covers a majority of the basin and overflows into Lacus Somniorum to the northeast. The most noticeable feature is the crater Posidonius on the northeast rim of the mare. The ring feature to the west of the mare is indistinct, except for Montes Haemus. Mare Serenitatis connects with Mare Tranquillitatis to the southeast and borders Mare Vaporum to the southwest. Mare Serenitatis is an example of a mascon, an anomalous gravitational region on the Moon.

A mass concentration (mascon), or gravitational high, was identified in the center of Mare Serenitatis from Doppler tracking of the five Lunar Orbiter spacecraft in 1968. The mascon was confirmed and mapped at higher resolution with later orbiters such as Lunar Prospector and GRAIL.

==Names==
Like most of the other maria on the Moon, Mare Serenitatis was named by Giovanni Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized. Previously, William Gilbert had cited it as within the Regio Magna Occidentalis (&quot;Large Western Region&quot;) in his map of &quot;c&quot;.1600. Pierre Gassendi had included it as part of the &#x27;Homuncio&#x27; (&#x27;little man&#x27;), referring to a small humanoid figure that he could see among the maria; Gassendi also referred to it as &#x27;Thersite&#x27; after Thersites, the ugliest warrior in the Trojan War. Michael van Langren had labelled it the Mare Eugenianum (&quot;Eugenia&#x27;s Sea&quot;) in his 1645 map, in honour of Isabella Clara Eugenia, queen of the Spanish Netherlands. And Johannes Hevelius included it within Pontus Euxinus (after the classical name for the Black Sea) in his 1647 map.
==Exploration==
Both Luna 21 and Apollo 17 landed near the eastern border of Mare Serenitatis, in the area of the Montes Taurus range. Apollo 17 landed specifically in the Taurus-Littrow valley, and Luna 21 landed in Le Monnier crater. SpaceIL&#x27;s &quot;Beresheet&quot; lunar lander was planned to land in Mare Serenitatis, but crashed into the surface on 11 April 2019. Its final resting place was about 33°N, 19°E, near to the centre of the mare.

<text>Mare Smythii (Latin for &quot;Smyth&#x27;s Sea&quot;) is a lunar mare located along the equator on the easternmost edge of the Moon&#x27;s near side, named for the 19th-century British astronomer William Henry Smyth. It is one of only two lunar maria that are named after people, the other being Mare Humboldtianum (named after German explorer Alexander von Humboldt).

The Smythii basin where the mare is located is of the Pre-Nectarian epoch, while the surrounding features are of the Nectarian system. It is contained within a minimal diameter of , and has been excavated to a depth of . The mare material, which makes up the floor of the mare, is a low alumina basalt, and consists of Upper Imbrian basalt covered by Eratosthenian basalt. Features observed within the basin include wrinkle ridges, submerged &quot;ghost&quot; craters, domes, crater chains, and rilles.

The overall shape of the mare is circular, likely the result of a large impact. Further bombardment followed, creating the irregular shape. Subsequent volcanism laid down the mare material. As a result of this sequence, only the northeastern portion and a smaller area in the western central contain significant regions of smooth mare material. The remaining surface is more hummocky with a higher albedo. The geological features suggest that lava flowed from the southeast and west toward the northeast, where it accumulated in the lowest parts of the basin. Mare Smythii contains a relatively high number of craters with fractured floors, including the noticeably unusual crater Haldane. This is probably a result of uplift from injection of magma below the mare.

The crater Neper is located to the north of the mare. This crater makes up part of the southern rim of Mare Marginis. Just off to the northwest of the mare are the craters Schubert and Schubert B. The dark mare-filled crater at the southern edge of Smythii is the crater Kästner.

<text>Mare Spumans (Latin &quot;spūmāns&quot;, the &quot;foaming sea&quot;) is a lunar mare located just south of Mare Undarum on the lunar near side. It is one of the many elevated lakes contained in the Crisium basin, surrounding Mare Crisium. The surrounding basin material is of the Nectarian epoch, while the mare basalt being of the Upper Imbrian epoch. The crater Petit (formerly ) is located on the western rim of the mare. This crater is white and surrounded by a well-defined ray system.

==Apollo Landmark==
A small, bright-rayed crater located in northern Mare Spumans was known as landmark A-1/11 (1.7981° N, 65.0741° E). Astronaut Michael Collins tracked this landmark on revolution 4 of Apollo 11. Tracking the crater with a sextant and feeding the information into the onboard computer enhanced orbital information. Collins referred to this crater as KAMP, after his three children and wife (Kate, Ann, Michael, and Patricia).

<text>Mare Undarum (Latin &quot;undārum&quot;, the &quot;sea of waves&quot;) is a shallow, irregular lunar mare located just north of Mare Spumans on the lunar near side, between the crater Firmicus and the eastern limb. It lies within a trough between the third and fourth raised rings formed by the impact that created the Mare Crisium. The selenographic coordinates of this mare are 7.5° N, 68.7° E. It has a maximum diameter of 245 km.

There are five known lunar domes within the mare. The surrounding basin material is of the Nectarian epoch, with the mare basalt being of the Upper Imbrian epoch. The crater Dubyago can be seen on the southern edge of the mare. On the northeastern edge of the mare is the crater Condorcet P.

When Mädler observed this area in the 1830s, he noted variations in the curved dark streaks that form this mare, leading him to speculate that the changes were caused by vegetation.

<text>Mare Vaporum (Latin &quot;vapōrum&quot;, the &quot;sea of vapors&quot;) is a lunar mare located between the southwest rim of Mare Serenitatis and the southeast rim of Mare Imbrium. It was named by Giovanni Battista Riccioli in 1651.

The mare lies in an old basin or crater that is within the Procellarum basin. It is in diameter and in area, and is bordered to the northeast by the mountain range Montes Apenninus. In the south of the mare is Rima Hyginus, a rille intersected by the crater Hyginus. The lunar material surrounding the mare is from the Lower Imbrian epoch, and the mare material is from the Eratosthenian epoch.

<text>The Queensland tropical rain forests ecoregion (WWF ID: AA0117) covers a portion of the coast of Queensland in northeastern Australia and belongs to the Australasian realm. The forest contains the world&#x27;s best living record of the major stages in the evolutionary history of the world&#x27;s land plants, including most of the world&#x27;s relict species of plants from the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana. The history of the evolution of marsupials and songbirds is also well represented.

==Location and description==
The ecoregion covers of northeastern coastal Queensland, from the coast up a series of plateaus and tablelands to the mountains behind the coast. The ecoregion comprises three separate sections. The northern area, which includes Cairns, is the largest, from 15°30’ to 19°25’ south latitude. This northern section is also known as the Wet Tropics bioregion, and is just east of the Einasleigh Uplands. The middle section is centred on Mackay, Queensland, and the southern section is just south of Shoalwater Bay. These latter two sections correspond to the Central Mackay Coast bioregion and are bounded on the west by the Brigalow tropical savanna ecoregion. Elevations in the ecoregion rise from sea level to 1,477 metres, with a mean of 301 metres.

==Climate==
The climate of the ecoregion is a borderline tropical rainforest climate (Af) and &quot;Dry-winter humid subtropical climate&quot; (Köppen climate classification (Cwa)). The latter climate is characterized as having no month averaging below , at least one month averaging above , and four months averaging over . Precipitation in the wet summer months is ten times or more the average of the winter months. In this particular ecoregion, annual precipitation is highly variable, with annual averages between 1,200 and 8,000 mm. The rainy season is November to April.

==Flora and fauna==
The Queensland tropical rain forests are designated one of the Global 200 ecoregions. The ecoregion is the largest remnant of Australia&#x27;s rain forest flora, home to ancient assemblage of plants, called the Antarctic flora, presently characteristic of New Zealand and southern Chile. Fossil pollen records indicate closed forest covered most of Australia between 50 and 100 million years ago. These forests represent the closest living remnant of the vegetation type from which all of Australia&#x27;s unique vegetation developed. The vegetation remained across Australia and Antarctica until about 15 million years ago.
Currently, about 65% of the ecoregion is closed forest of broadleaf evergreens. Conifers of the southern hemisphere family Araucariaceae are the characteristic tree species. In the northern section of the ecoregion, Kauri commonly form the forest canopy, with &quot;Agathis robusta&quot; most common at lower elevations, and &quot;A. microstachya&quot; and &quot;A. atropurpurea&quot; predominant at higher elevations. In the southern sections, &quot;Araucaria cunninghamii&quot; is predominant, with &quot;Araucaria bidwillii&quot; dominant in two small areas. Conifers in the family Podocarpaceae are also present, including genera &quot;Podocarpus&quot; and &quot;Sundacarpus&quot;. The forests are thick with vines, ferns, epiphytes, and palms.

These forests are limited to areas of high rainfall and good soils. In waterlogged soils, the rainforest flora gives way to &quot;Melaleuca&quot; thickets, and on poor soils and in drier areas &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; becomes dominant. The rainforest flora is intolerant of fire, and where periods of drought have allowed devastating fires, the rainforest flora has retreated, allowing fire-tolerant &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; to become established. If a relatively wet period persists, the rainforest flora may reestablish itself. It is thought that the land management practices of the aboriginal Australians, which involve setting regular fires to keep the eucalyptus woodlands open, may have encouraged the expansion of eucalyptus forests at the expense of the rainforest flora. These rainforests seem to have retreated considerably since the arrival of the aboriginals&#x27; ancestors 50,000 years ago, and are presently limited to isolated pockets comprising less than 2% of the continent&#x27;s area.

Animal biodiversity is high, also. 672 species of terrestrial vertebrates have been recorded in the ecoregion, 370 species of birds, 70 species of reptile, and 78 species of freshwater fish (of Australia&#x27;s total of 180 fish species). 11% of the vertebrates are endemic to the region, and 22% of the reptiles. Most of the endemic species live about 400 metres in the rainforest.

==Conservation==
These forests are particularly interesting because of their southern location and the high degree of endemism of their plant and animal species. Deforestation caused by logging, road building and farming has led to habitat fragmentation and diminishing populations of species such as spotted-tailed quoll &quot;(Dasyurus maculatus)&quot;, cassowary &quot;(Casuarius casuarius)&quot;, and ring-tail possum &quot;(Hemibelideus lemuroides)&quot;. Introduced species also pose a serious threat to many native species.

In an effort to preserve the Daintree Rainforest north of the Daintree River it was decided by the Government of Queensland in 1993 to halt the spread of the electricity network north of that point, providing a limit to tourist development.

Protected areas include the following:
* Homevale National Park
* Eungella National Park
* Dryander National Park
* Conway National Park
* Whitsunday Islands National Park
* Paluma Range National Park
* Halifax Bay Wetlands National Park

* Hinchinbrook Island National Park
* Girramay National Park
* Girringun National Park
* Hull River National Park
* Kurrimine Beach National Park
* Eubenangee Swamp National Park

* Ella Bay National Park
* Wooroonooran National Park
* Barron Gorge National Park
* Daintree National Park
* Cedar Bay National Park
* Kalkajaka National Park
==Tourism==

The forests, together with the Great Barrier Reef, have been identified and promoted as a major tourist attraction of Tropical North Queensland, one of five within the state. One of the most significant tourist attractions in the rain forests is the Skyrail Rainforest Cableway.

<doc id="206301" wikidata="Q839752" url="?curid=206301" title="Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy of birds">
<text>The Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy is a bird taxonomy proposed by Charles Sibley and Jon E. Ahlquist. It is based on DNA–DNA hybridization studies conducted in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s.

DNA–DNA hybridization is among a class of comparative techniques in molecular biology that produce distance data (versus character data) and that can be analyzed to produce phylogenetic reconstructions only using phenetic tree-building algorithms. In DNA–DNA hybridization, the percent similarity of DNA between two species is estimated by the reduction in hydrogen bonding between nucleotides of imperfectly complemented heteroduplex DNA (i.e., double stranded DNAs that are experimentally produced from single strands of two different species), compared with perfectly matched homoduplex DNA (both strands of DNA from the same species).

==Characteristics==
The classification appears to be an early example of cladistic classification because it codifies many intermediate levels of taxa: the &quot;trunk&quot; of the family tree is the class Aves, which branches into subclasses, which branch into infraclasses, and then &quot;parvclasses&quot;, superorders, orders, suborders, infraorders, &quot;parvorders&quot;, superfamilies, families, subfamilies, tribes, subtribes and finally genera and species. However the classification study did not employ modern cladistic methods, as it relies strictly on DNA-DNA hybridization as the sole measure of similarity.

The Sibley–Ahlquist arrangement differs greatly from the more traditional approach used in the Clements taxonomy.

Showing major changes from Clements, the Sibley–Ahlquist orders are as follows:
* Enlarged Struthioniformes replaces the ratite orders Rheiformes (rheas), Casuariiformes (cassowaries and emus), and Apterygiformes (kiwis) and Struthioniformes (ostriches).
* Tinamiformes (tinamous) is unchanged.
* A greatly enlarged Ciconiiformes includes the previous Sphenisciformes (penguins), Gaviiformes (divers), Podicipediformes (grebes), Procellariiformes (tubenoses), Pelecaniformes (pelicans and allies), Ciconiiformes (storks and allies), Falconiformes (birds of prey), Charadriiformes (waders, gulls, terns, and auks), and the family Pteroclidae (sandgrouse).
* Anseriformes (ducks and allies) is unchanged.
* Modified Galliformes landfowl. Chachalacas moved to Craciformes.
* New Craciformes chachalacas etc. Previously part of Galliformes.
* Modified Gruiformes Cranes. Button-quails moved to Turniciformes.
* New Turniciformes button-quails etc. Previously part of Gruiformes.
* Modified Columbiformes doves. Sandgrouse moved to Ciconiiformes.
* Psittaciformes cockatoos and parrots unchanged.
* New Musophagiformes turacos. Previously part of Cuculiformes.
* Modified Cuculiformes cuckoos. Turacos moved to Musophagiformes.
* Modified Strigiformes owls. Enlarged to include Caprimulgiformes (nightjars, owlet-nightjars, frogmouths, oilbirds, potoos).
* Modified Apodiformes swifts. Hummingbirds moved to Trochiliformes.
* New Trochiliformes hummingbirds. Previously part of Apodiformes.
* Coliiformes mousebirds unchanged.
* Trogoniformes trogons unchanged.
* Modified Coraciiformes rollers.
* New Upupiformes Hoopoe. Previously part of Coraciiformes.
* New Bucerotiformes hornbills. Previously part of Coraciiformes.
* New Galbuliformes jacamars and puffbirds. Previously part of Piciformes.
* Modified Piciformes woodpeckers
* Passeriformes perching birds unchanged.

Some of these changes are minor adjustments. For instance, instead of putting the swifts, treeswifts, and hummingbirds in the same order that includes nothing else, Sibley and Ahlquist put them in the same superorder that includes nothing else, consisting of one order for the hummingbirds and another for the swifts and treeswifts. In other words, they still regard the swifts as the hummingbirds&#x27; closest relatives.

Other changes are much more drastic. The penguins were traditionally regarded as distant from all other living birds. For instance, Wetmore put them in a superorder by themselves, with all other non-ratite birds in a different superorder. Sibley and Ahlquist, though, put penguins in the same superfamily as divers (loons), tubenoses, and frigatebirds. According to their phylogenetic analysis, penguins are closer to those birds than herons are to storks.

The Galloanserae (waterfowl and landfowl) has found widespread acceptance. The DNA evidence of Sibley–Ahlquist for the monophyly of the group is supported by the discovery of the fossil bird &quot;Vegavis iaai&quot;, an essentially modern but most peculiar waterfowl that lived near Cape Horn some 66–68 million years ago, still in the age of the dinosaurs.

<text>Montes Haemus is a mountain range that forms the southwestern edge of the Mare Serenitatis basin on the Moon. It forms a less prominent mirror image of the Montes Apenninus range to the west, and curves up to nearly join at the northern end. The eastern edge terminates with the Promontorium Archerusia, to the northwest of the crater Plinius. This end reaches a gap where the Mare Serenitatis to the north joins the Mare Tranquillitatis to the south.

The selenographic coordinates of this range are , and the length is 560 km. The tallest peaks in this range climb as high as 2.4 km.

This range is named after Haemus Mons, an old Thracian name of the Balkan Mountains. It appeared on the map of Moon due to Johannes Hevelius. But he assigned this name (in the form &quot;Mons Æmus&quot;) to another feature – remains of the rim of crater Alexander, located on the other side of Mare Serenitatis. Later the name moved to the subject of this article. The same name, but with reversed order of words – &quot;Haemus Montes&quot; – belongs to one of mountain systems on Io.

Several rille systems lie along the eastern side of this range. The eastern end of the range forms the western terminus of a rille system designated Rimae Plinius. 100 km farther to the west the craters Menelaus and Auwers are embedded within the range, and to their northeast are the Rimae Menelaus. Where the mountain range curves up to the northwest, the cup-shaped crater Sulpicius Gallus lies nearby on the lunar mare. Just to the northwest of this crater, and paralleling the mountains, are the Rimae Sulpicius Gallus.

Several small lakes, formed from basaltic lava, lie along the southwest face of the range. From the northwest to the southeast these are Lacus Odii, Lacus Doloris, Lacus Gaudii, and Lacus Hiemalis. The Lacus Lenitatis lies farther to the south.

<text>Montes Riphaeus (Latin for &quot;Riphaeus Mountains&quot;) is an irregular range of lunar mountains that lie along the west-northwestern edge of Mare Cognitum, on the southeastern edge of Oceanus Procellarum. The range trends generally from north-northeast to south-southwest. It includes a number of slender ridge lines with valleys flooded by intruding flows of lava.

This range is located at selenographic coordinates 7.7° S, 28.1° W. It has a diameter of , although it is typically only about wide. The nearest feature of note is Euclides, a small but prominent crater to the west. About to the north is the crater Lansberg.

The range is named after the Riphean Mountains in the geography of classical antiquity. Johannes Hevelius was the first astronomer to apply the Riphean label to a feature of the lunar landscape, but Johann Heinrich von Mädler is responsible for the current designation of the Montes Riphaeus.

<text>Halfaya Pass ( ) is in northwest Egypt, 11.5 kilometres east of the border with Libya and 7.5 kilometres south of the other, more major pass in the ridge today. A high, narrow escarpment extends south then southeastwards for a total of from a short distance east of the border. It hems in east-facing small harbour town of as-Salum, continuing as an east-facing sea cliff further north. Land to the east is lower than that to the west and the east side has steep slopes. 

The pass is centred inland from the closest part of the shore. It makes for a subtle wind gap in the escarpment for the east-west land route. It made for the southern Mediterranean coastal road useful to Mediterranean civilizations until the pass at as-Salum was enlarged after World War II.

Among veterans of Allied forces from 15 June 1941 and thereafter it was nicknamed Hellfire Pass.

The escarpment is known as &quot;Akabah el-Kebir&quot; &quot;great ascent&quot;. To El-Edrisi it was known as &quot;ʿAqaba as-Sallūm&quot; &quot;graded ascent&quot;, whence the modern name of the gulf/bay and the town of Salum. To ancient Rome it was known as &quot;Catabathmus Magnus&quot;, in the peak of whose empire it divorced Aegyptus from Marmarica. The range was seen as a demarcator of Africa and Asia in some Hellenistic geography.

==World War II==

In World War II, the engineered route up the escarpment had been destroyed and the pass had great strategic importance. The only ways westwards into Libya were to assault the pass or to out-flank it to the south.

After the defeat of the Italian Tenth Army on 7 February 1941 during Operation Compass, the Italians were reinforced by German units (Afrika Korps under Erwin Rommel) and the British forces were forced out of Libya, leaving besieged garrison at Tobruk. On 14 April 1941, Rommel&#x27;s main force reached Sollum and occupied the Halfaya Pass. Allied attempts to recapture the pass and relieve Tobruk followed.

The first attempt, on 15 May, was Operation Brevity. Rommel counter-attacked; the British withdrew and by 27 May the Germans had recaptured Halfaya Pass, a passage of time in which Major Edward Thomas earned his Military Cross. Supply shortages obliged the Germans to curtail their advance, so they dug in and fortified their positions at Halfaya with 88 mm guns. This was the anchor for the Axis positions, which opposed the Allied forces during the next allied attack.

This was Operation Battleaxe on 15 June. German armour was deployed to draw the British tanks (11th Hussars) onto the concealed 88mm guns and the first wave was cut down in a few minutes (11 out of 12 tanks were destroyed), earning the pass the nickname &quot;Hellfire Pass&quot;. The German commander, Major Wilhelm Bach, in his conduct of the Axis defence of Halfaya Pass earned himself the nickname German: (an allusion to his peacetime occupation as a Lutheran minister and the English nickname &quot;Hellfire Pass&quot;). The commander of the larger Italian contingent, General Fedele de Giorgis, General Officer Commanding 55th Infantry Division Savona, was awarded the highest German decoration, the Knight&#x27;s Cross for the defense he conducted. A British tank commander was last heard on the radio reporting, &quot;They are tearing my tanks apart.&quot;

The third attempt, Operation Crusader opened on 18 November, with an attack on Sidi Omar to the west of the pass and an attempt to outflank Rommel to the south and relieve Tobruk. This was achieved on 29 November. Rommel, now under pressure, on 7 December withdrew to El Agheila. Axis garrisons at Sollum, Bardia as well as the Pass were left behind, a temporary thorn in the Allies side. Isolated after the fall of Bardia on 2 January 1942, besieged by Commonwealth forces, cut off from supplies, and bombarded from the air and the sea, Bach and de Giorgis finally surrendered the Halfaya garrison of 4,200 Italians of the 55th Savona and 2,100 Germans, to the South African 2nd Infantry Division on 17 January 1942.

The pass was scene of the accidental death of Major-General &#x27;Jock&#x27; Campbell (VC), then commander of the British 7th Armoured Division. On 26 February 1942, a month after assuming command, his staff car overturned on the newly laid clay surface, killing him outright.

== In Popular Culture ==
The pass and its according battles play a role in the Sniper Elite III game plot.

The pass inspires a Battlefield V map, Hamada.

<text>Hellfire Pass (, known by the Japanese as &quot;Konyu Cutting&quot;) is the name of a railway cutting on the former Burma Railway (&quot;Death Railway&quot;) in Thailand, which was built with forced labour during World War II. More than 250,000 Southeast Asian civilians and 12,000 Allied soldiers built the railway line, including Hellfire Pass. The pass is noted for the harsh conditions and heavy loss of life suffered by its labourers during construction. It was called Hellfire Pass because the sight of emaciated prisoners labouring by burning torchlight resembled a scene from Hell.

==History==
Hellfire Pass in the Tenasserim Hills was a particularly difficult section of the line to build, a dramatic cutting some 75 metres long and 25 metres deep. It was the largest rock cutting on the railway, coupled with its general remoteness and the lack of proper construction tools during building. A tunnel would have been possible to build instead of a cutting, but this could only be constructed at the two ends at any one time, whereas the cutting could be constructed at all points simultaneously despite the excess effort required by the prisoners of war (POWs). The Australian, British, Dutch and other allied prisoners of war were required by the Japanese to work 18 hours a day to complete the cutting. Sixty-nine men were beaten to death by Japanese guards in the six weeks it took to build the cutting, and many more died from cholera, dysentery, starvation, and exhaustion (Wigmore 568). However, the majority of deaths occurred amongst civilian labourers, whom the Japanese enticed to come to help build the line with false promises of good jobs. These labourers, mostly Malayans (Chinese, Malays and Tamils from Malaya), suffered mostly the same as the POWs at the hands of the Japanese.

The railway was never built to a level of lasting permanence and was frequently bombed by the Royal Air Force during the Burma Campaign. After the war, all but the present section was closed and the line is now only in service between Bangkok and Nam Tok Sai Yok Noi.

===Present day===
There are no longer any trains running on this stretch of the line. The nearest railway station is at Nam Tok Sai Yok Noi, where trains of the State Railway of Thailand can be taken for a trip over the Wang Pho Viaduct and across the bridge over the River Kwai to Kanchanaburi, which is the nearest major town and tourist base. Visitors to the site usually base themselves in Kanchanaburi.

==Historical preservation and museum==
The Hellfire Pass Memorial Museum and the preservation of the Hellfire Pass itself had its origins in 1983, when former POW J.G. (Tom) Morris toured the area in Thailand and resolved to convince the Australian Government that portions of the Thai-Burma Death Railway should be preserved as a historical site. Thanks to his efforts, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC) was commissioned in 1984 to make a survey of the railway to choose a suitable site. Jim Appleby, a SMEC engineer at the Khao Laem dam site on the upper Kwai Noi, did much of the ground work and passed his reports to the Australian-Thai Chamber of Commerce in 1985. 

The first dawn service was held at the Hellfire Pass on Anzac Day 1990. The museum is co-sponsored by the Royal Thai Armed Forces Development Command and the Australian government to commemorate the suffering of those involved in the construction of the railway. It was built by the Office of Australian War Graves and opened by the then Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard. 

Renovated in 2018, the Hellfire Pass Interpretive Centre provides information and exhibits about the construction of the Death Railway, and the suffering and sacrifices endured during its construction. The museum includes multimedia displays, artifacts, and a memorial to those who lost their lives. As a part of the museum experience, it is possible to walk through the cutting itself and along a section of the former railway track bed. An audio tour, including recorded memories of surviving POWs, is available at the centre.

==Recent developments==
In 2006, proposals to create a railway network linking eight south-east Asia countries would see a railway link restored between Thailand and Myanmar. It is not clear if this would follow the original Death Railway route through Hellfire Pass, since this route was necessarily built quickly and to low standard of curves and gradients.

==Hintok==

Hintok (also: Hintock) was an area just beyond Hellfire Pass. It was the beginning of the highlands, and the railway line needed a gradual gradient to climb. There were four camps: the river camp, which was subdivided into British, Australian and Tamil camps; and the mountain camp, which housed Australian, British and Dutch prisoners. The mountain camp was commanded by Weary Dunlop, and had a bamboo fence to protect against tigers.

The first prisoners arrived on 26 January 1943 and were tasked to clear the forest and construct the camps. By March 1943, there were 800 prisoners in the camps. Beyond the Hellfire Pass was the Three-Tiered Bridge, a trestle bridge to gain height, followed by another 400-metre-long and 25-metre-high trestle bridge which was later named the Pack of Cards Bridge because it collapsed three times during construction, and was later abandoned in favour of an embankment.

On 19 June 1943, there was an outbreak of cholera at the Hintok mountain camp, killing 57 Australian prisoners. 31 prisoners died during the Pack of Cards Bridge&#x27;s collapses, and 29 died from guard brutality. 130 sick prisoners were sent to Tarsao. Construction of the bridges was finished in August 1943. The Three-Tiered Bridge was often photographed after the war, but is now lost in the jungle.

<doc id="206313" wikidata="Q703583" url="?curid=206313" title="Operation Foxley">
<text>Operation Foxley was a code name of the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) plan to assassinate Adolf Hitler in 1944. At the height of World War II, one option to swiftly end the war was killing Hitler. The SOE developed two potential assassination modules, one was to poison, and the other, shooting with a special gun. Although detailed preparations were made, no attempt was made to carry out the plan. The secret document, a 20-page dossier, was declassified in July 1998 by the British Public Record Office following the 30-year confidentiality limit.

==Prior plans==
At the start of World War II in 1939, British secret services had thought of scheming assassination plans against Hitler. However, the propositions were never equivocally initiated. As Winston Churchill became the British Prime Minister in 1940, he had keen interest in various military tactics and authorised in 1941 to hatch plots for assassinations of Nazi leaders. In one of the most successful high-ranking assassinations, name Operation Anthropoid, Czech soldiers, Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš ambushed Reinhard Heydrich, chief of the Reich Security Main Office (including the Gestapo, Kripo, and SD) on 27 May 1942. Heydrich died of his injuries on 4 June. Trainings and planning for the operatives were done by SOE. One of the first actual British plans to assassinate Hitler was to bomb the special train &quot;Amerika&quot; (in 1943 renamed &quot;Brandenburg&quot;) he travelled in; SOE had extensive experience of derailing trains using explosives. The plan was dropped because Hitler&#x27;s schedule was too irregular and unpredictable: stations were informed of his arrival only a few minutes beforehand.

== Background ==
In June 1944, an anonymous informer tipped the SOE office in Algiers, North Africa, there would be an opportunity to kill Hitler as he was to visit a chateau in Perpignan, southern France. Although the SOE did not take any action upon the suggestion, the message inspired Major General Colin Gubbins, head of the SOE, to devise more a surreptitious plan. 

== Plan ==

Ultimately a sniper attack was considered to be the method most likely to succeed. In the summer of 1944, a German who had been part of Hitler&#x27;s personal guard at the Berghof had been taken prisoner in Normandy. He revealed that at the Berghof, Hitler always took a 20-minute morning walk at around the same time (after 10:00). Hitler liked to be left alone during this walk, leaving him unprotected near some woods, where he was out of sight of sentry posts. When Hitler was at the Berghof, a Nazi flag visible from a cafe in the nearby town was flown. 

The plan was to assassinate Hitler during his morning exercise, as he walked unprotected to the &quot;Teehaus&quot; on Mooslahnerkopf Hill from the Berghof residence. The scheme called for the SOE to parachute a German-speaking Pole and a British sniper into Austria. An &quot;inside man&quot; was recruited, the uncle of a prisoner of war named Dieser, who was a shopkeeper living in nearby (20 km) Salzburg, identified as &quot;Heidentaler&quot;, who was vehemently anti-Nazi. Heidentaler would shelter the agents and transport them to Berchtesgaden disguised as German mountain troops (&quot;Gebirgsjäger&quot;), from where they would make the approach to the vantage point for the attack.

A sniper was recruited and briefed, and the plan was submitted. The sniper practised by firing at moving dummy targets with an accurized Kar 98k with a Mauser telescopic sight, the standard rifle of the Wehrmacht, under conditions that simulated the planned attack. Additionally, a 9mm parabellum Luger pistol fitted with a British-made silencer was provided so that the sniper could quietly deal with any threats while approaching the target. The Luger is now on display at the Combined Military Services Museum in Maldon, Essex.

Another plan was to put some tasteless but lethal poison in the drinking water supply on Hitler&#x27;s train. However, this plan was considered too complicated because of the need for an inside man.

There was some opposition to the assassination plan among the British authorities, particularly from the Deputy Head of SOE&#x27;s German Directorate, Lt. Col. Ronald Thornley. However, his superior, Sir Gerald Templer, and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill supported it. 

Hitler left the Berghof for the last time on 14 July 1944, never to return; six days later, anti-Nazi Wehrmacht officers attempted to assassinate him as part of the 20 July plot.

<doc id="206314" wikidata="Q74526" url="?curid=206314" title="Annibale Bergonzoli">
<text>Annibale Bergonzoli (1 November 1884 – 31 July 1973), nicknamed &quot;barba elettrica&quot;, &quot;Electric Whiskers&quot;, was an Italian lieutenant general who served during World War I, the Spanish Civil War and World War II. In 1940 he commanded the defences of Bardia, Libya. In February 1941, after the disastrous Battle of Beda Fomm, Bergonzoli surrendered to Australian forces. He was held as a prisoner in India and the USA before being repatriated to Italy. Bergonzoli settled in his birthplace, Cannobio, and died there in 1973.

== Biography ==
===Italian colonial wars===
He entered the Italian Regio Esercito in 1911, beginning his military career as a second lieutenant. Bergonzoli then took part in the occupation of Libya during the Italo-Turkish War in 1911, continuing to be prominent in Libya for several years, dedicated to mop-up operations against Libyan rebels opposed to Italian colonization.

He also took part in the First World War, a conflict in which he received several decorations for his performance at the front.

In 1935 he participated in the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, which culminated in the annexation of Ethiopia to the Kingdom of Italy, distinguishing especially in the capture of the Ethiopian city of Neghelli.

===Spanish Civil War===
Between 1936 and 1939, Bergonzoli was ordered by Benito Mussolini to Spain, forming part of the &quot;Corpo Truppe Volontarie&quot;, in support of General Francisco Franco and the military rebels during the Spanish Civil War, with Bergonzoli taking charge of the 4th Infantry Division Littorio. After the defeat suffered by the Italian troops at the battle of Guadalajara, he was the only Italian general posted to Spain who was not replaced by Benito Mussolini.

For his performance in the capture of Santander during the northern campaign, he received an Italian decoration, the Gold Medal of Military Valour. Throughout his career, he received two other silver and one bronze medals. He was one of the architects of the so-called Pact of Santoña, by which the Italians accepted the agreed surrender of the Republican People&#x27;s Army militants affiliated with the Basque Nationalist Party. He also participated in the Aragon Offensive against the troops of the Republican Popular Army.

===Second World War===
In 1940 he was the commander-in-chief of the XXIII Italian Army Corps when the invasion of Egypt was attempted.

Bergonzoli was the commander of the Italian garrison in Bardia, which fell on 5 January 1941 following an assault by Commonwealth forces. While most of his men were taken prisoner, Bergonzoli managed to avoid being captured when he escaped through the desert with other soldiers, arriving in Tobruk on 7 January 1941 after crossing some 120 km of desert on foot.

He left Tobruk before the town was captured by Commonwealth forces on 22 January, but on 7 February 1941 Bergonzoli, along with the remnants of the 10th Army, was taken prisoner by troops of the 6th Australian Division in the Battle of Beda Fomm. He was taken first to India and then to the United States as a prisoner of war.

===Last years===
He returned to Italy in 1946, settling in Cannobio, his place of birth, until his death on 31 July 1973.

==Popular culture==
In the 1941 film, &quot;Love Crazy&quot;, starring Myrna Loy and William Powell, Powell&#x27;s character refers to another character played by Vladimir Sokoloff in the film, as looking like &quot;General Electric Whiskers&quot;. This may be a reference to General Bergonzoli in a pun on his nickname and General Electric.

Bergonzoli is mentioned in C.S. Forester&#x27;s wartime short story &quot;An Egg for the Major&quot; (later published in Forester&#x27;s &quot;Gold from Crete&quot;, 1971), which describes the Battle of Beda Fomm from the perspective of a British light tank commander in an unnamed unit that historically would be the 7th Hussars.

<doc id="206318" wikidata="Q2895978" url="?curid=206318" title="Desert Air Force">
<text>The Desert Air Force (DAF), also known chronologically as Air Headquarters Western Desert, Air Headquarters Libya, the Western Desert Air Force, and the First Tactical Air Force (1TAF), was an Allied tactical air force created from No. 204 Group RAF under RAF Middle East Command in North Africa in 1941 to provide close air support to the British Eighth Army against Axis forces. Throughout the Second World War, the DAF was made up of squadrons from the Royal Air Force (RAF), the South African Air Force (SAAF), the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and other Allied air forces.

In October 1941, the Western Desert Air Forces had 16 squadrons of aircraft (nine fighter, six medium bomber and one tactical reconnaissance) and fielded approximately 1,000 combat aircraft by late 1941. By the time of the Second Battle of El Alamein, the DAF fielded 29 squadrons (including nine South African and three USAAF units) flying Boston, Baltimore and Mitchell medium bombers; Hurricane, Kittyhawk, Tomahawk, Warhawk and Spitfire fighters and fighter-bombers. There were over 1,500 combat aircraft, more than double the number of aircraft the Axis could field.

==History==
Prior to the establishment of the Desert Air Force, several RAF formations operated in North Africa. On 3 September 1939, RAF Middle East Command—under Air Chief Marshal Sir William Mitchell, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Middle East—comprised four separate commands: for Egypt (designated Middle East), RAF Iraq, Mediterranean at Malta, and RAF Aden (No. 8, No. 203, and No. 94 Squadrons). Mitchell handed over to Air Vice Marshal Sir Arthur Longmore in early May 1940. When Italy declared war in June 1940, Longmore had just 29 squadrons numbering less than 300 aircraft in the four commands detailed above.

===AHQ Egypt===

On 10 June 1940, RAF bomber squadrons in AHQ Egypt—under the direction of No. 202 Group RAF—totalled five squadrons of Bristol Blenheims, one of Vickers Valentias and one of Bristol Bombays. The Valentia and Bombay could be used as troop transports or medium bombers.
* HQ 202 Group, Ma&#x27;aten Bagush
** No. 250 Wing RAF, Ismailia
*** No. 30 Squadron RAF, Blenheim, Ismailia
*** No. 55 Squadron RAF, Blenheim, Fuka
*** No. 113 Squadron RAF, Blenheim, Ma&#x27;aten Bagush
** No. 253 Wing RAF, Advanced HQ Ma&#x27;aten Bagush
*** No. 45 Squadron RAF, Blenheim, Fuka
*** No. 211 Squadron RAF, Blenheim, Daba
** No. 70 (Bomber-Transport) Squadron RAF, Valentia, Helwan
** No. 216 (Bomber-Transport) Squadron RAF, Bombay, Heliopolis
AHQ Sudan had 254 Wing with No. 14, No. 223 and No. 47 squadrons, AHQ Aden had No. 8, No. 11, and No. 39 squadrons, and No. 84 Squadron RAF was at Shaibah in Iraq with Blenheims.

Prior to the Italian invasion of Egypt, under Air Commodore Raymond Collishaw, the RAF in Egypt—which comprised nine squadrons—focused its activities on ground support, reconnaissance, and only when necessary aerial combat with the Italian &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;. The force at Collishaw&#x27;s disposal consisted of No. 33, No. 80, and No. 112 Squadrons with Gloster Gladiators, No. 208 Squadron RAF with Westland Lysanders, four Blenheim squadrons (No.s 30, 55, 113, and 211) and No. 216 Squadron RAF with Bombays. With this small force, the RAF had to &quot;equate its attempt to dominate the front line with avoidance of unnecessary losses&quot;. Aggressive actions induced a &quot;defensive mentality among the Italians&quot;, aided by expedients such as using the single Hawker Hurricane in the Middle East, rapidly switched between landing grounds, to provide an exaggerated picture of British strength in the eyes of Italian reconnaissance aircraft. There were occasional single successes as well; on 17 August 1940, Gladiators covering the Mediterranean Fleet shot down eight Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers without loss.

The force in the Middle East was clearly too small, reinforcement by sea was a 14,000-mile trip that required three months to complete, and reinforcement via the Western Mediterranean was hardly practical due to the ranges involved, which only bombers could achieve. Thus, an alternate reinforcement route began to be pioneered via Takoradi in the Gold Coast, from which new aircraft were received by sea, assembled, test flown, and ferried across Africa to Khartoum, a route first pioneered by Air Vice-Marshal Arthur Coningham in 1925. By this and other means, by the end of November 1940 the RAF in Egypt had been bolstered by No. 73 and No. 274 Squadrons with Hurricanes and No. 37 and No. 38 Squadrons with Vickers Wellingtons, as well as several South African Air Force squadrons, ready for the beginning of Operation Compass. During Compass, &quot;the squadrons of Hurricanes, Lysanders, and Blenheims … strove hard to keep pace [with the ground forces], often landing after a combat sortie at a more advanced strip than from which they had set out.&quot;

On 19 April 1941, RAF No. 204 Group was created under the command of Air Commodore Raymond Collishaw and consisted of:
* No. 73 Squadron (Hurricanes) at Tobruk
* No. 274 Squadron (Hurricanes) at Gerawla
* No. 14 Squadron (Blenheim IVs and Marauders) at Burg el Arab
* Detachment of No. 39 Squadron (Marylands) at Maaten Baggash
* Detachment of No. 24 Squadron SAAF (Marylands) at Fuka
* No. 45 Squadron (Blenheim IVs) at Fuka
* No. 55 Squadron (Blenheim IVs) at Zimla
* No. 6 Squadron (Hurricanes and Lysanders) at Tobruk.

On 30 July 1941, Collishaw handed over No. 204 Group to Coningham. Later that year, RAF Middle East Command came under the command of Air Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder. On 21 October 1941, Air Headquarters Western Desert was created by upgrading 204 Group to command status.

Three wings operated in North Africa at first, 258 and 269 Wings operated over the front line and 262 Wing defended the Nile Delta. On 20 January 1942, the command was renamed Air Headquarters Libya; however, on 3 February it reverted to its former name of the Air Headquarters Western Desert.

===Allied restructuring===
In January 1943, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, American President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and their staffs reorganised the Allied air forces in the North African and Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) at the Casablanca Conference. The Western Desert Air Force became a sub-command of Coningham&#x27;s Northwest African Tactical Air Force (part of Northwest African Air Forces) in February 1943 and Air Vice Marshal Harry Broadhurst became its Air Officer Commanding. On 18 February 1943, the Mediterranean Air Command (MAC) was established with Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder in charge of all Allied air forces in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO).
When the Allied forces invaded Sicily (Operation Husky) on 10 July 1943, Desert Air Force (DAF) was created by simply renaming Western Desert Air Force. For Operation Husky, DAF contained &quot;Advanced&quot; and &quot;Rear&quot; elements.

Advanced Headquarters, Desert Air Force,No. 211 (Offensive Fighter) Group with Spitfires:
Other &quot;Advanced&quot; units included:
* 40 Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, SAAF (Spitfires)
* 1/2 No. 600 Squadron (TEF/N) operating on Malta under A.O.C. Malta (Beaufighters)
* No. 325 Wing RAF (Beaufighters)
** 1/2 No. 600 Squadron
** No. 153 Squadron (TEF/N) operating from North Africa

Rear Headquarters, Desert Air Force.
Operating from Tripoli Area

* No. 285 Wing RAF (Reconnaissance)
** No. 1437 Flight RAF (SR) (Baltimores)
** 60 Squadron SAAF
** No. 682 Squadron RAF
(60 and 682 were Photographic Reconnaissance (PR) squadrons assigned from the Northwest African Photographic Reconnaissance Wing)
* Other RAF units
** No. 6 Squadron (TD) (Hurricane IIDs)
** No. 249 Air Transport Wing

DAF continued to provide close tactical support to the British Eighth Army as a subordinate element of NATAF. MAC was disbanded in December 1943 and reorganised into the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces (MAAF) which absorbed NAAF, RAFM, and possibly some units of RAFME. DAF, still under Broadhurst, became a component of the Mediterranean Allied Tactical Air Force (MATAF) under Major General John K. Cannon. The successful tactical air support of ground forces in Egypt and Libya pioneered by Tedder and Coningham was the model for the establishment of NAAF at the Casablanca Conference and the tri-force (strategic, coastal, tactical) elements of this air interdiction model were retained in the new MAAF structure which generally persisted until the end of the Second World War. DAF existed until 30 June 1946, when it was renamed the Advanced AHQ Italy.

==Aircraft==
The air defence of Britain always received priority, so the DAF was generally equipped with older aircraft types. Initially equipped with obsolete types like the Gloster Gladiator biplane fighter and the Bristol Blenheim light bomber, the DAF made a good showing against the equally obsolete Italian Air Force. After the direct threat to Britain receded, newer types were assigned to the DAF, such as the Hawker Hurricane and Douglas Boston medium bomber in 1941.

US-built P-40 Tomahawks/Kittyhawks also went to the DAF as it was unsuited to European operations which were generally fought at much higher altitudes and against more formidable opposition. The P-40 was used initially as an air superiority fighter but it was also adapted (and found to be ideally suited) to ground attack missions.

The DAF always outnumbered its Axis opponents and concentrated on long-range interdiction and direct tactical Eighth Army support. Unfortunately, these tactics meant that the faster Messerschmitt Bf 109s of &quot;Jadgdeschwader&quot; 27 usually had the advantage of height and surprise over the low-level, slow-flying DAF fighters and losses were correspondingly high. In 1942, the DAF reorganised its tactics and introduced better aircraft. Spitfires were eventually used for air superiority, becoming operational in August 1942, which allowed the DAF to gain air superiority.

The DAF adapted the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; concept of tactical air support by using fighter-bombers linked via radio to &quot;Forward air controllers&quot; attached to Army units. The DAF improved the concept by introducing &quot;cab ranks&quot; of fighter-bombers in the air waiting to be called on. The DAF provided air support to the Eighth Army until the end of the war, fighting over Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Sicily and mainland Italy. The tactical concepts which had proven so successful in the latter part of the North African campaign were adopted with even greater success during the Invasion of Europe in 1944.

==Personnel==
The SAAF provided over a dozen squadrons to the DAF. This was their main theatre of operations, as the South African government had decided their military should not operate outside Africa. Between April 1941 and May 1943, the 11 squadrons of the SAAF flew almost 34,000 sorties and claimed 342 enemy aircraft destroyed.

The Australian contribution included fighter and bomber squadrons, including No. 3 Squadron RAAF, which arrived in North Africa in late 1940 and served with the DAF until the closing stages of the war in Europe. By that time, 3 Sqn had the most substantial service record of any DAF squadron, including the greatest number of kills (217 claims). Many Australian pilots also flew with RAF or SAAF squadrons in the DAF.

Many exiles from Occupied Europe—especially Polish airmen— flew in DAF squadrons. No. 112 Squadron RAF was largely made up of Poles and in 1943, the Polish Fighting Team (&quot;Skalski&#x27;s Circus&quot;) was attached to No. 145 Squadron RAF.

From July 1942, the United States Army Middle East Air Force (USAMEAF, Major-General Lewis H. Brereton) attached USAAF personnel from the 57th Fighter Group and 12th Bombardment Group to DAF fighter and bomber units, as &quot;observers&quot;. This was technically a violation of the Arnold-Portal-Towers agreement, which included a stipulation that American personnel should serve only in US units. From mid-September, the P-40 Warhawk squadrons of the 57th FG and the B-25 squadrons of the 12th BG were officially attached to DAF units. On 12 November 1942, USAMEAF was dissolved and replaced by the 9th Air Force, although some US units remained with Commonwealth formations for some time.

British and Commonwealth personnel who served with the DAF were awarded the Africa Star campaign medal with the clasp &#x27;North Africa 1942–43&#x27;, denoted by a silver rosette when only ribbons were worn.

==Commanders==
The following were the air officers commanding either the Air Headquarters Western Desert or the Desert Air Force:
* AHQ Western Desert
** 21 October 1941 Air Vice-Marshal Arthur Coningham (also AOC AHQ Libya)
** 31 January 1943 Air Vice-Marshal Harry Broadhurst
* Desert Air Force
** 10 July 1943 Air Vice-Marshal Broadhurst
** 6 April 1944 Air Vice-Marshal William Dickson
** 3 December 1944 Air Vice-Marshal Robert Foster
** 30 August 1945 Air Commodore Colin Falconer

<text>The mayor of New York City, officially mayor of the City of New York, is head of the executive branch of the government of New York City and the chief executive of New York City. The mayor&#x27;s office administers all city services, public property, police and fire protection, most public agencies, and enforces all city and state laws within New York City.

The budget, overseen by New York City Mayor&#x27;s Office of Management and Budget, is the largest municipal budget in the United States, totaling $100.7 billion in fiscal year 2021. The city employs 325,000 people, spends about $21 billion to educate more than 1.1 million students (the largest public school system in the United States), and levies $27 billion in taxes. It receives $14 billion from the state and federal governments.

The mayor&#x27;s office is located in New York City Hall; it has jurisdiction over all five boroughs of New York City: Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Staten Island and Queens. The mayor appoints numerous officials, including deputy mayors and the commissioners who head city agencies and departments. The mayor&#x27;s regulations are compiled in title 43 of the &quot;New York City Rules&quot;. According to current law, the mayor is limited to two consecutive four-year terms in office but may run again after a four-year break. The limit on consecutive terms was changed from two to three on October 23, 2008, when the New York City Council voted 29–22 in favor of passing the term limit extension into law. However, in 2010, a referendum reverting the limit to two terms passed overwhelmingly. The position of mayor of New York has been branded as the &quot;second toughest job&quot; in the United States of America, behind only the U.S. president.

The current mayor is Eric Adams, who was elected on November 2, 2021, and took office shortly after midnight on January 1, 2022.

== History ==

In 1665, Governor Richard Nicolls appointed Thomas Willett as the first mayor of New York. For 156 years, the mayor was appointed and had limited power. Between 1783 and 1821 the mayor was appointed by the Council of Appointment in which the state&#x27;s governor had the loudest voice. In 1821 the Common Council, which included elected members, gained the authority to choose the mayor. An amendment to the New York State Constitution in 1834 provided for the direct popular election of the mayor. Cornelius W. Lawrence, a Democrat, was elected that year.

Gracie Mansion has been the official residence of the mayor since Fiorello La Guardia&#x27;s administration in 1942. Its main floor is open to the public and serves as a small museum.

The mayor is entitled to a salary of $258,750 a year. Michael Bloomberg, mayor of the city from 2002 to 2013 and one of the richest people in the world, declined the salary and instead was paid $1 yearly.

In 2000, direct control of the city&#x27;s public school system was transferred to the mayor&#x27;s office. Thereafter, in 2003, the reorganization established the New York City Department of Education.

Tammany Hall, which evolved from an organization of craftsmen into a Democratic political machine, was an American political organization founded in 1786 and incorporated on May 12, 1789. It became the main local political machine of the Democratic Party and played a major role in controlling New York City and New York State politics. The organization gained control of Democratic Party nominations in the state and city in 1861, and played a major role in New York City politics into the 1960s and was a dominant player from the mayoral victory of Fernando Wood in 1854 through the era of Robert Wagner (1954–1965). Its last political leader was an African American man named J. Raymond Jones.

== Deputies ==
The mayor of New York City may appoint several deputy mayors to help oversee major offices within the executive branch of the city government. The powers and duties, and even the number of deputy mayors, are not defined by the City Charter.

The post was created by Fiorello La Guardia (who appointed Grover Whalen as deputy mayor) to handle ceremonial events that the mayor was too busy to attend. Since then, deputy mayors have been appointed with their areas of responsibility defined by the appointing mayor. There are currently five deputy mayors, all of whom report directly to the mayor. The majority of agency commissioners and department heads report to one of the deputy mayors, giving the role a great deal of power within a mayoral administration.

Deputy mayors do not have any right to succeed to the mayoralty in the case of vacancy or incapacity of the mayor.

== Removal from office ==
According to the New York City Charter, the governor of New York has the power to remove the mayor from office in response to allegations of misconduct, but the governor must hear the mayor&#x27;s defense of the allegations before doing so. The governor can suspend the mayor for 30 days while considering the allegations. In 2024, it was reported that Governor Kathy Hochul was considering whether to use that process against Eric Adams after his indictment on federal corruption charges. Prior to 2024, the last New York governor to consider exercising this power was in 1932, when (then Governor) Franklin D. Roosevelt considered removing Jimmy Walker as mayor, who was accused of taking bribes from city contractors; however, Walker resigned before Roosevelt could remove him.

The charter also provides a separate process for the mayor&#x27;s removal without the involvement of the governor: a five-member &quot;Inability Committee&quot; is formed composed of the city&#x27;s corporation counsel (head of the New York City Law Department), the speaker of the New York City Council, a deputy mayor (the mayor gets to choose which one), the New York City comptroller, and the longest-serving borough president; by a four-fifths vote, the committee can refer allegations of misconduct or incapacity to the City Council, who can then by a two-thirds vote permanently remove the mayor from office, or temporarily suspend the mayor. This process has never been used.

In the event the mayor dies, resigns or is removed from office, the order of succession is the public advocate of the City of New York, then the comptroller of the City of New York. The successor becomes interim mayor pending a special election.

== Commentary ==

The New York City mayoralty has become known as the &quot;second toughest job in America.&quot; It has been observed that politicians are rarely elected to any higher office after serving as mayor of New York City; the last mayor who later achieved higher office was John T. Hoffman, who became governor of New York in 1869. Former mayor Ed Koch said that the post was jinxed due to divine intervention, whereas Michael Bloomberg has called the supposed curse &quot;a statistical fluke.&quot;

<doc id="206328" wikidata="Q1347163" url="?curid=206328" title="Michael A. Stackpole">
<text>Michael Austin Stackpole (born November 27, 1957) is an American science fiction and fantasy author best known for his &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;BattleTech&quot; books. He was born in Wausau, Wisconsin, but raised in Vermont. He has a BA in history from the University of Vermont. From 1977 on, he worked as a designer of role-playing games for various gaming companies, and wrote dozens of magazine articles with limited distribution within the industry. He lives in Scottsdale, Arizona.

==Game design career==
Michael Stackpole was hired full-time at Flying Buffalo after they accepted his submission for a solo &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; adventure which was published in 1978 as &quot;City of Terrors&quot;. He wrote columns on industry news and reviews for Flying Buffalo&#x27;s magazine &quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;. Stackpole worked for Coleco from 1980 to 1981 after Rick Loomis, Stackpole, and the president of Coleco met at a gaming and pinball convention. Stackpole designed the roleplaying game &quot;Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes&quot;, which Flying Buffalo published in 1983. Stackpole left Flying Buffalo after the company&#x27;s 1985 move to Scottsdale, Arizona. Stackpole, Ken St. Andre, and Liz Danforth designed the computer roleplaying game &quot;Wasteland&quot;, published by Interplay in 1988. He later returned to work with his fellow creators of Wasteland as a writer on its sequel &quot;Wasteland 2&quot;, released in 2014 by inXile Entertainment.

In response to the accusations of Patricia Pulling (among others) who felt that the &quot;occult&quot; elements of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; were driving people to suicide, Stackpole began to defend the game and the roleplaying game community. Stackpole published one of his first articles about the role-playing games misinformation from the media in &quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; #14 (Spring 1982) as an article titled &quot;Devil Games? Nonsense!&quot;, and even debated the Western Regional Director of Pulling&#x27;s BADD organization on a radio program broadcast on July 14, 1987. He compared BADD&#x27;s statistics of suicides among role-playing gamers to the rate of general teen suicide and found the percentage of roleplayers committing suicide was actually lower than those who were not gamers, and published his argument in an article called &quot;The Truth about Role-Playing Games&quot; in the 1989 book &quot;Satanism in America&quot;; he also published the document &quot;The Pulling Report&quot; in 1990, which further discredited Pulling&#x27;s stand against roleplaying games.

In the 1980s, Stackpole began designing computer games for Coleco and then Interplay Productions. His work at Interplay included &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale III&quot;, &quot;Wasteland&quot;, &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: 25th Anniversary&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Judgment Rites&quot;. He also created the role-playing game &quot;Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes&quot;, which provided the game mechanics for &quot;Wasteland&quot;, and wrote several solo adventures for the Tunnels &amp; Trolls role-playing system, including &quot;Dargon&#x27;s Dungeon&quot;, &quot;Overkill&quot;, &quot;City of Terrors&quot; and &quot;Sewers of Oblivion&quot;.

Stackpole loaned his image to Decipher for the image of Corran Horn used in their &quot;Star Wars Customizable Card Game&quot; expansion &quot;Reflections 2&quot;. Timothy Zahn did likewise for the character Talon Karrde. Stackpole teamed up with Decipher again, helping them write the background story to their &quot;WARS TCG&quot;, including e-books and other writing tie-ins for the expanded universe.

In January, 2019 Stackpole resigned from the Board of Directors of GAMA (Game Manufacturer&#x27;s Association), citing its inactivity and the poor handling of an incident involving GAMA President Stephen Brissaud. He was one of the few remaining Emeritus Directors (alongside Rick Loomis and Will Niebling).

==Writing career==

In 1986 Stackpole wrote his first novel, the fantasy story &quot;Talion: Revenant&quot;. His editors believed that a 175,000 word book was too long for an unknown author and that the story wasn&#x27;t particularly engaging. The story remained unpublished for the next 11 years until reworked by Stackpole&#x27;s editor, Anne Lesley Groell. Stackpole clarifies these issues himself in the afterword of the published version of &quot;Talion.&quot; The manuscript was published in 1997 by Bantam Books.

Stackpole&#x27;s first published novels were the Warrior trilogy for the &quot;BattleTech&quot; universe, published by FASA in 1988-1989. His &quot;Blood of Kerensky&quot; trilogy (1989-1991) were the last novels that FASA directly published; &quot;&quot; (1994) was set during the events of this trilogy. Stackpole also wrote a trilogy of novels published in 1992, which were based on the &quot;Dark Conspiracy&quot; roleplaying game by GDW.

Stackpole has found his greatest success in serial works that continue the characters and plot lines developed by other authors. In 1987 he began writing novels set in the BattleTech universe for FASA Corporation, some of which were used as the source for a television animated series. He was then selected to write several novels in the Star Wars universe for Bantam Books. He also wrote several comics based in the Star Wars universe for Dark Horse Comics. Initially these covered the period just before his &quot;X-Wing&quot; novels. Later, he also covered the marriage of Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade in the graphic novel &quot;Union&quot; and collaborated with Timothy Zahn on Mara Jade&#x27;s early career. In the foreword to his book &quot;Outbound Flight&quot;, Timothy Zahn thanks Stackpole and issues a challenge at &quot;Star Wars Trivial Pursuit&quot;.

In addition, he has written several novels and short stories with original settings. One series is the &quot;DragonCrown War Cycle&quot;. These books attempted to break fantasy conventions in order to stir reader interest, including the introduction of firearms in a fantasy setting. Reception of these books was fairly positive based on Amazon reviews, but reviews elsewhere were not as good.

Stackpole contributed one of the four stories in Roger Zelazny&#x27;s shared world anthology &quot;Forever After&quot;, published by Baen Books in 1995. He was a contributor in the 1998 anthology &quot;Lord of the Fantastic&quot; commemorating Zelazny.

&quot;The Age of Discovery&quot; trilogy is his latest complete series, with &quot;A New World&quot; released mid-2007. The trilogy is set in a fantasy world, with an attempt at an unconventional approach to magic and mastery.

&quot;The Crown Colonies&quot; is a trilogy that re-imagines the events of the American Revolutionary War. The first book, &quot;At The Queen&#x27;s Command&quot;, was released in November 2010.

At New York Comic Con 2012, it was revealed that Blizzard Entertainment had approached Stackpole to write the next novel in their series based on the popular MMORPG, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;. The novel, titled &quot;Vol’jin: Shadows of the Horde&quot;, centres around the chieftain of the Darkspear Trolls as his loyalty to the Horde is put to the ultimate test after an assassination attempt on his life. The novel was released in July 2013.

==&quot;The Secrets&quot;==

===Newsletter===
Stackpole also writes and publishes an online newsletter titled &quot;The Secrets&quot;, which offers tips, tricks, and tidbits about fan fiction writing (focusing on, but not limited to, science fiction and fantasy). It is aimed towards the serious fan fiction writer and some casual writers, and includes information about getting books published..

Topics discussed in the newsletter range from how to beat writer&#x27;s block to how to build a world, and even how to manage writing as a career.

&quot;The Secrets&quot; newsletter requires a subscription, and issues are released every two weeks.

===Podcast===
&quot;The Secrets&quot; Newsletter has an &quot;audio companion&quot; in The Secrets Podcast. The first ten podcasts were based on material from the first ten issues of The Secrets newsletter. After the first series ended, the content of the podcast diverged from the newsletter. The podcasts average twenty-five minutes long and are voiced and produced by Stackpole.

The podcasts are free and require no subscription, but older episodes have been retired and are no longer available on the main archive.

Stackpole is also one of the main hosts on &quot;The Dragon Page Cover to Cover&quot;, a book review and interview show dealing mainly with fantasy and sci fi publications, together with Michael R. Mennenga.

==Skepticism==
Stackpole has been the executive director of the Phoenix Skeptics since 1988 and is listed as the contact for the group in the magazine &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;.

==Asteroid==

===BattleTech===
The BattleTech novels were originally published by FASA Corporation up until 1991. In that year, Penguin Group/Roc Books took over the line and also reprinted the earlier novels. The last print novel of the classic BattleTech setting was published in 2002; in the same year, the first novel for the Dark Age setting (set some 100 years after the classic setting) was published, written by Stackpole. His novels were typically &quot;spine novels&quot; that moved the setting ahead, narrating large-scale or otherwise important events with far-reaching consequences in the fictional timeline.

<text>BattleTech is a wargaming and military science fiction franchise launched by FASA Corporation in 1984, acquired by WizKids in 2001, which was in turn acquired by Topps in 2003; and published since 2007 by Catalyst Game Labs. The trademark is currently owned by Topps and, for video games, Microsoft Gaming; Catalyst Game Studios licenses the franchise from Topps.

The series began with FASA&#x27;s debut of the board game &quot;BattleTech&quot; (originally named &quot;Battledroids&quot;) by Jordan Weisman and L. Ross Babcock III and has since grown to include numerous expansions to the original game, several board games, role playing games, video games, a collectible card game, a series of more than 100 novels, and an animated .

== Gameplay ==
In its most basic form, &quot;BattleTech&quot; is played on a map sheet composed of hexagonal terrain tiles. The combat units are roughly humanoid armored combat units called BattleMechs, powered by fusion reactors and armed with a variety of weapons. Typically, these are represented on the game board by two-inch-tall miniature figurines that the players can paint to their own specifications, although older publications such as the 1st edition included small scale plastic models originally created for the &quot;Macross&quot; TV series, and the 2nd and 4th edition boxed sets included small cardboard pictures (front and back images) that were set in rubber bases to represent the units. The game is played in turns, each of which represents 10 seconds of real time, with each turn composed of multiple phases.

== Setting ==
&quot;BattleTech&quot;&#x27;s fictional history covers the approximately 1,150 years from the end of the 20th century to the middle of the 32nd. Most works in the series are set during the early to middle decades of the 31st century, though a few publications concern earlier ages. &quot;MechWarrior: Dark Ages&quot; and its related novels take place in the mid 3100s.

A detailed timeline stretching from the late 20th century to the mid-32nd describes humanity&#x27;s technological, social and political development and spread through space both in broad historical terms and through accounts of the lives of individuals who experienced and shaped that history, with an emphasis on (initially) the year 3025 and creating an ongoing storyline from there. Generally, &quot;BattleTech&quot; assumes that its history is identical to real-world history up until approximately 1984, when the reported histories begin to diverge; in particular, the game designers did not foresee the fall of the Soviet Union, which plays a major role past 1991 in the fictional &quot;BattleTech&quot; history. Individual lifestyles remain largely unchanged from those of modern times, due in part to stretches of protracted interplanetary warfare during which technological progress slowed or even reversed. Cultural, political and social conventions vary considerably between worlds, but feudalism is widespread, with many states ruled by hereditary lords and other nobility, below which are numerous social classes.

A key feature of the &quot;BattleTech&quot; universe is the absence of non-human intelligent life. Other than one or two isolated encounters in novels, mankind is the only sentient species.

Above all, the central theme of &quot;BattleTech&quot; is conflict, consistent with the franchise&#x27;s wargaming core. Interstellar and civil wars, planetary battles, factionalization and infighting, as well as institutionalized combat in the shape of arena contests and duelling, form the grist of both novelized fiction and game backstories.

The level of technology evident in &quot;BattleTech&quot; is an unusual blend of the highly futuristic and the nearly modern. The universe leans towards hard science fiction concepts. Much of the technology is either similar to that of the present day, or considered plausible in the near-future, such as the railgun. There are exceptions such as faster-than-light travel and communication, without which the setting cannot function. Radically advanced tech mixes with seemingly anachronistic technologies such as internal combustion engines and projectile weapons. Artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, androids, and many other staples of future fiction are generally absent or downplayed. Incessant warfare is generally blamed for the uneven advancement, the destruction of industry and institutes of learning over the centuries of warfare having resulted in the loss of much technology and knowledge. As rivalries and conflicts have dragged on, advanced technologies are redeveloped for the battlefield.

Chicago-based FASA Corporation&#x27;s original 1984 game focused on enormous robotic, semi-humanoid battle machines battling in a science-fiction feudalistic Dark Age setting. The game was at first called &quot;Battledroids&quot;. The name of the game was changed to &quot;BattleTech&quot; in the second edition because George Lucas and Lucasfilm claimed the rights to the term &quot;droid&quot;; the machines themselves were renamed BattleMechs from the second edition onward.

The game components included:
*First edition: two full-color terrain maps, 48 stand-up BattleMech counters, four sheets of playing markers, plastic counter stands, dice, and a rule book.
*Third edition: two color maps, a pack of record sheets, and fourteen 2&quot; plastic miniatures of various BattleMech war machines.
*Fourth edition: two rule-books, a booklet of record sheets, 48 stand-up playing pieces, and a sheet of 144 insignia stickers.

===Illustrations &amp; imagery===
Rather than create their own original robot art, FASA decided to use already-extant designs that had originally been created for a variety of different Japanese anime, including &quot;Dougram&quot;, &quot;Crusher Joe&quot;, and &quot;Macross&quot;. The rights to these images were licensed from &quot;Twentieth Century Imports (TCI)&quot;. In later years, FASA abandoned these images as a result of a lawsuit brought against them by Playmates Toys and Harmony Gold over the use of said images. 

The anime-sourced BattleMechs continued to be referenced in-universe, but their images were no longer seen in new sourcebooks. This led them to be termed by fans as &quot;the Unseen&quot;. When Fantasy Productions licensed the property, these &quot;Unseen&quot; images were expanded to include all art produced &quot;out-of-house&quot; – that is, whose copyrights resided with the creators, not the company. Catalyst Game Labs has continued this practice.

=== Expansions ===
The game&#x27;s popularity spawned several variants and expansions to the core system, including &quot;CityTech&quot; which fleshed out urban operations, infantry, and vehicle combat, &quot;AeroTech&quot; which focused on air and space-based operations, and &quot;BattleSpace&quot; which detailed large spacecraft combat. FASA also published numerous sourcebooks, known as Technical Readouts, which featured specifications for new combat units that players could select from. However, despite the large number of such pre-designed BattleMechs, vehicles, aerospace units and other military hardware, the creators also established a system of custom design rules, enabling players to generate their own units and field them in combat. In addition to game rule books, FASA published several background books detailing the history, political and social structures of various factions in the game, including all five Great Houses of the Inner Sphere, ComStar, the Periphery states and the fallen Star League.

FASA launched two additional systems to complement the core game: &quot;BattleTroops&quot;, an infantry combat system, and &quot;BattleForce&quot;, a large-scale combat simulator governing the actions of massed &quot;BattleTech&quot; units. &quot;The Succession Wars&quot;, a board game released in 1987, is one of only two purely strategic titles of the series (the other being &quot;The Inner Sphere in Flames&quot; from the Combat Operations book). &quot;The Succession Wars&quot; is played on a political star map, with players trying to capture regions of space.

Recent years have seen a trend of consolidating the expansions into &quot;core products&quot; for efficiency. Beginning under FanPro&#x27;s aegis, then continued under Catalyst Game Labs, the various rulesets have been combined into a series of Core Rulebooks:

*Total Warfare (TW) integrates the original boardgame with &quot;CityTech&quot;, &quot;BattleTroops&quot;, and parts of &quot;AeroTech 2&quot; (itself a consolidation of &quot;AeroTech&quot; and &quot;BattleSpace&quot;) pertaining to atmospheric operations (such as simplified rules for Dropship operations, and the use of AeroTech Fighters in atmospheric combat).
*Tactical Operations (TO) supplements &quot;Total Warfare&quot; with rules for expanded game-play (advanced rules). These include an expanded weapons / equipment table listing (Lostech), advanced unit types (such as &quot;mobile structures&quot;, planetary fortresses, and &quot;large support vehicles&quot;) as well as numerous optional gameplay enhancements for planetary-level conquests (consolidating &quot;Maximum Tech&quot; and other expansion packs, like &quot;Explorer Corps&quot;).
*Strategic Operations (SO) consolidates the rules for multi-game campaigns within a single star system (such as unit morale and management, repair and maintenance, equipment salvage, in-game construction, and unit-level economics) with the remaining &quot;AeroTech 2&quot; rules omitted from TW. These include the introduction of capital-level spacecraft (Jumpships / Warships / Space Stations / Fighter Squadrons) and equipment, space warfare rules, and the use of space travel as a gameplay element. A revised version of &quot;BattleForce&quot; is also consolidated into the book.
*TechManual (TM) consolidates the customization rules with technical fluff from various products for units compliant to &quot;Total Warfare&quot; rules. (Construction rules for the missing units are listed in TO or SO, as these units are not considered to be &quot;tournament legal&quot; for gameplay).
* Interstellar Operations (IO) was originally a project that had been available in beta form. The book was designed to introduce rules for faction-wide operations (such as entire Clans / Succession Houses / Empires) across multiple campaigns and star systems—up to and including the entire Inner Sphere. The book itself would have also included an expansion of additional technologies which stipulated per time period in the game universe&#x27;s history, including revised rules for more advanced types of vehicles such as Land-Air &#x27;Mechs, Superheavy BattleMechs, and unique period technologies. The size of the materials slated for the book forced its splitting into two volumes; the second, which was initially known as the &quot;Campaign Companion&quot;, was renamed.
* Campaign Operations (CO) is the self-contained companion book to Interstellar Operations. The book provides core rules handling player campaigns, using different rules sets. Taking older legacy rules found in previous source books, CO presented them in a singular core rulebook for better accessibility for the player. Included in the publication are rules to build environments for players to create and maintain combat units to be played in the game universe and rules allowing them to design their own worlds and star systems if desired.
*BattleMech Manual is an alternative Core Rulebook to Total Warfare. Unlike Total Warfare, the Battlemech Manual ignores all elements of combined operations, instead presenting concise and developed rules for playing games of Battletech focused exclusively on BattleMechs fighting against Battlemechs. The book is marketed as &quot;table usage friendly&quot; and serves as a complete, standalone game experience for players who want a single book for Mech focused combat.

===After FASA===
After the FASA Corporation closed in 2000, Wizkids bought the rights to the game in January 2001. They reworked the IP to launch their collectible miniatures game, but licensed the rights to continue to publish products for the old game to FanPro (itself a subsidiary of Fantasy Productions). Topps bought Wizkids in 2003, but this did not change any publishing agreements at that time. FanPro held the license to the original tabletop game (which they rebranded as &quot;Classic BattleTech&quot;) until 2007. At that point Catalyst Game Labs (CGL) acquired the license from Topps. CGL continues to hold the license to this day; with the end of the &quot;MechWarrior: Dark Age&quot; miniatures game, the name of the traditional tabletop game has reverted to simply &quot;BattleTech&quot;.

On June 24, 2009, Catalyst Game Labs announced that they had secured the rights to the &quot;Unseen&quot; art. As a result, art depicting the original &#x27;Mechs could be legally used again. However, an update on August 11, 2009, stated that the part of the deal regarding designs that originated in images from &quot;Macross&quot; had fallen through, returning the original images to Unseen status once again. Since then, designs that originated in images from &quot;Dougram&quot; and &quot;Crusher Joe&quot; are no longer considered Unseen.

== Reception ==
In the March 1988 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 131), Jim Bambra called the first edition &quot;BattleTech&quot; tabletop game &quot;a brilliantly conceived and presented game of robotic combat set in the war-torn universe of the Successor States&quot;, and complimented the high production values of the game components. Bambra concluded with a recommendation: &quot;Try the &quot;Battletech&quot; game. If you like it, it might inspire you to form your own BattleMech unit and battle your way across the Successor States.&quot;

In the June 1993 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 194), Rick Swan reviewed FASA&#x27;s third edition and liked the rules revisions &quot;presenting the fundamentals in clear, simple language&quot;. Swan also admired the game&#x27;s post-apocalyptic vision, calling it &quot;one of the hobby&#x27;s richest settings.&quot; He concluded with a recommendation to buy the third edition: &quot;While the previous version was a class act ... the third edition stands as the definitive treatment, a handsome upgrade worth the purchase price even for owners of the old editions.&quot;

In the August 1997 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 238), Rick Swan reviewed FASA&#x27;s fourth edition of &quot;BattleTech,&quot; and called it &quot;A snap to learn... as exciting as it is addictive; there are few gaming experiences more satisfying than blasting giant robots into scrap metal.&quot; However, for people who already owned the third edition, Swan suggested that &quot;there&#x27;s no compelling reason to invest in version four.&quot;

== Spin-offs ==

The &quot;BattleTech&quot; franchise first extended beyond the tabletop wargame format with the release of &quot;MechWarrior&quot;, a role-playing game in which players portray BattleMech pilots or other characters in the 31st century. The RPG system has been republished in several editions and expanded by various sourcebooks and supplements. In 1996, FASA also introduced the &quot;BattleTech Collectible Card Game&quot;, a CCG developed by Wizards of the Coast, creators of the popular &quot;&quot;.

WizKids, owners of the &quot;BattleTech&quot; franchise after 2001, introduced a collectable miniatures-based variant of the classic tabletop game called &quot;&quot; in 2002 (later renamed &quot;&quot;). The game incorporates WizKids&#x27; &quot;Clix System&quot;, a means of tracking the combat statistics and abilities of each figure by turning a dial in its base.

BattleMechs, the hulking flagship units of the franchise, made a natural subject for computer emulation, and so in 1988 Infocom released a PC/Commodore 64/Amiga based RPG called &quot;&quot;. It was later followed up with a sequel, &quot;&quot; in 1990. Both games were reasonably well received, although aside from storyline continuity the second game held few similarities to its predecessor. The first pure simulation of BattleMech combat, however, was released for computers in 1989. Titled &quot;MechWarrior&quot; and published by Activision, the single-player game gave users the opportunity to pilot a range of Mechs and engage in combat against computer-controlled opponents. Sequels &quot;MechWarrior 2&quot; (1995), &quot;MechWarrior 2: Mercenaries&quot; (1996), &quot;MechWarrior 3&quot; (1999) and &quot;MechWarrior 4&quot; (2000), and &quot;MechWarrior 4: Mercenaries&quot; (2002) created simulations of progressively higher technical sophistication. &quot;Mekpaks&quot; for &quot;MechWarrior 4: Mercenaries&quot; made by Mektek were released, adding new weapons, Mechs and graphics. A group also modded &quot;Crysis&quot; for the release of a &quot;BattleTech&quot; game known as &quot;&quot; and the first public beta was released on December 26, 2009. A possible &quot;MechWarrior 5&quot; was being produced, though it lingered in development for about a year and was eventually canceled. Originally, Smith &amp; Tinker owned the &quot;BattleTech&quot; electronic rights, but, after failing to find funding for a new &quot;MechWarrior&quot; game, the rights to the series were bought by Piranha Games in 2011, who had originally been working with Smith &amp; Tinker to create MechWarrior 5. On July 9, 2009, it was confirmed that the franchise would be rebooted. Further trailers were released and it was confirmed that the timeline would be set around 3015. Though it seemed that the legal troubles which originally plagued FASA due to the similarities between &quot;BattleTech&quot; mechs and those in Robotech/Macross had returned to cause some troubles for Piranha Games, the company later released a statement noting that their primary troubles had been with finding a publisher, which eventually led to the announcement of a free-to-play reboot called &quot;Mechwarrior Online&quot;, set around the start of the clan invasions. The game was published in 2013 by Infinite Games Publishing, the same company which later published &quot;MechWarrior Tactics&quot;. IGP filed for bankruptcy and sold off the rights in December 2014. Piranha Games continued work on &quot;MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries&quot;, was released as an Epic Games exclusive in December 2019. Piranha Games will be releasing a stand-alone sequel to &quot;MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries&quot; called &quot;MechWarrior 5: Clans&quot; on October 3, 2024. 

The franchise saw its first online-dedicated game with &quot;Multiplayer BattleTech: EGA&quot; in 1992, which was followed by &quot;Multiplayer Battletech: Solaris&quot; in 1996. 1994 saw the series&#x27; first console original title, the simply titled &quot;BattleTech&quot; for the Sega Genesis. Other notable titles include the &quot;MechCommander&quot; series for the PC (&quot;MechCommander&quot; in 1998 and &quot;MechCommander 2&quot; in 2001), the &quot;MechAssault&quot; series (&quot;MechAssault&quot; and &quot;MechAssault 2: Lone Wolf&quot; in 2002 and 2004, respectively, for the Xbox, and &quot;&quot; in 2006 for the Nintendo DS). A new turn-based strategy game, simply titled &quot;BattleTech&quot;, was released in April 2018. The game was developed by Harebrained Schemes, and led by Jordan Weisman, the creator of the series.

== Magazines ==

BattleTech material appeared in various publications from other companies, ranging from articles in professional gaming magazines to fanzines devoted exclusively to the game. FASA provided some material to gaming magazines, allowed associated fan clubs like MechForce to publish newsletters, and treated some magazines like BattleTechnology as semi-official publications. Some of this material was treated as canon at the time and some of it, especially &#x27;Mech designs, came to be used in official product.

An exhaustive list is impossible but more notable publications are listed below.

== Other media==
===BattleTech Center===
The &quot;BattleTech&quot; creators&#x27; goal of creating an immersive BattleMech simulation came about 1990 with the opening of the first BattleTech Center at the North Pier Mall in Chicago. The BattleTech Center featured 16 networked, full-sized cockpits or &quot;pods&quot; that resembled a BattleMech cockpit with over 80 separate controls. Each player selected a &#x27;Mech to pilot into combat against up to seven other human players in the other cockpits. Virtual World Entertainment, the company that managed the centers, later opened many other Virtual World centers around the world. It later merged with FASA Interactive Technologies (FIT) to form Virtual World Entertainment Group (VWEG) in order to better capitalize on FASA&#x27;s properties. In 1999, Microsoft Corporation purchased VWEG to integrate FIT into Microsoft Game Studios and sold VWE. VWE continues to develop and support the current &quot;BattleTech&quot; VR platform called the Tesla II system, featuring &quot;BattleTech: Firestorm&quot;. Members of the &quot;pod&quot; ownership community continue to update the software and hardware for the Tesla II cockpits (e.g., by developing kits that allow to replace the original CRT monitors with modern LCD ones) for both private, commercial, and convention use.

===Tie-in fiction===
*More than 100 tie-in novels. The novels are set in both the Classic BattleTech era (mid-3000s) and the Dark Age era (3130s). The original (Classic) BattleTech novels were produced between 1986 and 2002, while the Dark Age era Novels were produced from 2002 to early 2008. Publication of titles under the Classic BattleTech and MechWarrior lines resumed at the end of 2008.
*An online writing project named &quot;BattleCorps&quot; produces novelettes set in different eras. The subscription-based &quot;BattleCorps&quot; offers monthly stories set across the history of the fictional universe. As of mid-2017, no new stories have been released in the first two quarters of 2017.
*&quot;The Spider and the Wolf&quot;, a comic book-style sourcebook published by FASA in 1986 as a supplement to the original board game. It depicts the inception of the &quot;Black Widow Company&quot; in 3015 and offers a brief introduction to the &quot;BattleTech&quot; universe as a prelude on the inside cover. Three potential game scenarios are presented in the back of the book.
*A series of licensed comics, published in the late 1980s by Blackthorne Publishing under the &quot;BattleTech&quot; and &quot;BattleForce&quot; monikers. The BattleTech comics included an &quot;annual&quot; and a &quot;3-D&quot; special issue, while the third of the three-issue BattleForce comic was left unpublished. The comics are not officially dated, but due to real-life publication date and plot context, speculation suggests that setting is circa 3025.
*A five-issue comic book limited series based on , &quot;BattleTech: Fallout&quot; was published by Malibu Comics from 1994 to 1995. The series is set in early 3050 during the Clan Invasion and depicts a group of disparate fugitives pairing with the Belt Pirates. The two parties form an irregular BattleMech force to remove the Clans from the &quot;Star&#x27;s End&quot; system. The first issue has two special editions, one with gold print (&quot;gold edition&quot;) and one with a holographic cover. The fifth issue (titled &quot;Issue #0&quot;), offers three very short supplemental stories outside of the main plot of the comic.
*A 13-episode television show, &quot;&quot;, aired on Fox in late 1994. The show was produced by Saban Entertainment and followed Major Adam Steiner and his unit, the First Somerset Strikers in an ongoing conflict with Clan Jade Falcon.
*Electric Entertainment, a company under contract to Paramount Studios, has leased the rights to produce a motion picture based on the &quot;BattleTech&quot; universe. Development has been slow and little is known about the project&#x27;s status.

<text>William Markham (1719 – 3 November 1807), English divine, served as Archbishop of York from 1777 until his death.

==Early life==
William Markham was born in 1719 to Major William Markham and Elizabeth (née Markham) of Kinsale in Ireland.

He was educated at Westminster School and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 6 June 1738, graduating BA 1742, MA 1745, BCL &amp; DCL 1752.

==Career==
He was one of the best scholars of his day, and attained to the headship of his old school and college: he served as Headmaster of Westminster 1753–1765, and Dean of Christ Church 1767–1776. Between those headships, he held the deanery of Rochester 1765–1767. He held from time to time a number of livings, and in 1771 was made Bishop of Chester and tutor to the Prince of Wales (later George IV). In 1776 he became Archbishop of York, and also Lord High Almoner and privy councillor.

He was a fierce critic of pamphleteer Richard Price concerning the American rebellion. He was for some time a close friend of Edmund Burke, but his strong championship of Warren Hastings caused a breach. He was accused by Lord Chatham of preaching pernicious doctrines, and was a victim of the Gordon Riots in 1780.

Bishop Markham was also the person who composed the Latin memorial for George Berkeley, the famous philosopher.

==Personal life==
In 1759, Markham married Sarah Goddard, the daughter of John Goddard, a wealthy English merchant of Rotterdam, with whom he had six sons and seven daughters:

*William Markham (1760–1815), of the East India Company, Private Secretary to Governor-General Warren Hastings
*John Markham (1761–1827), Admiral of the Royal Navy, First Sea Lord
*George Markham (1763–1822), Dean of York
*Henrietta Sarah Markham (1764–1844), married Ewan Law MP
*Elizabeth Catherine Markham (1765–1820), married William Barnett (as his second wife)
*David Markham (1766–1795), Lieutenant-Colonel of the 20th Regiment of Foot, killed in the Second Maroon War in Jamaica
*Robert Markham (1768–1837), Archdeacon of York
*Osborne Markham (1769–1827), MP for Calne
*Alicia Henrietta Markham (1771–1840), married Rev. Henry Foster Mills
*Georgina Markham (1772–1793), died unmarried
*Frederica Markham (1774–1860), married David William Murray, 3rd Earl of Mansfield
*Anne Katherine Markham (1778–1808), died unmarried
*Cecilia Markham (1783–1865), married Rev. Robert Philip Goodenough

===Descendants===
His granddaughter, Laura Markham, the second daughter of his son William, married William Mure, the Scottish scholar and politician who sat in the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1846 to 1855 as the Conservative MP for Renfrewshire and was Laird of Caldwell in Ayrshire. Their daughter, Emma Mure, (1833–1911) married Thomas Lister, 3rd Baron Ribblesdale (1828–1876) and had Thomas Lister, 4th Baron Ribblesdale.

His granddaughter, Emma Markham, another daughter of his son William, married the politician William Crompton-Stansfield who sat in the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1837 to 1853 as Whig Member of Parliament (MP) for Huddersfield.

<doc id="206337" wikidata="Q1070" url="?curid=206337" title="Ahmedabad">
<text>Ahmedabad ( ), also spelled as Amdavad (), is the most populous city in the Indian state of Gujarat. It is the administrative headquarters of the Ahmedabad district and the seat of the Gujarat High Court. Ahmedabad&#x27;s population of 5,570,585 (per the 2011 population census) makes it the fifth-most populous city in India, and the encompassing urban agglomeration population estimated at 6,357,693 is the seventh-most populous in India. Ahmedabad&#x27;s population in 2024 is estimated to be 8,854,444. Ahmedabad is located near the banks of the Sabarmati River, from the capital of Gujarat, Gandhinagar, also known as its twin city.

Ahmedabad has emerged as an important economic and industrial hub in India. It is the second-largest producer of cotton in India, due to which it was known as the &#x27;Manchester of India&#x27; along with Kanpur. Ahmedabad&#x27;s stock exchange (before it was shut down in 2018) was the country&#x27;s second oldest. Cricket is a popular sport in Ahmedabad; a newly built stadium, called Narendra Modi Stadium, at Motera can accommodate 132,000 spectators, making it the largest stadium in the world. The world-class Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Enclave is currently under construction and once complete, it will be one of the biggest sports centers (Sports City) in India. The effects of the liberalisation of the Indian economy have energised the city&#x27;s economy towards tertiary sector activities such as commerce, communication and construction. Ahmedabad&#x27;s increasing population has resulted in an increase in the construction and housing industries, resulting in the development of skyscrapers.

In 2010, Ahmedabad was ranked third in &quot;Forbes&quot;″s list of fastest growing cities of the decade. In 2012, &quot;The Times of India&quot; chose Ahmedabad as India&#x27;s best city to live in. The gross domestic product of Ahmedabad metro was estimated at $136.1 billion in 2023. In 2020, Ahmedabad was ranked as the third-best city in India to live by the Ease of Living Index. In July 2022, &quot;Time&quot; magazine included Ahmedabad in its list of world&#x27;s 50 greatest places of 2022.

Ahmedabad has been selected as one of the hundred Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under the Government of India″s flagship Smart Cities Mission. In July 2017, the historic city of Ahmedabad, or Old Ahmedabad, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage City.

== History ==
=== Toponymy ===
Based on relics found in several neighbourhoods of the old city and on writings of the Persian historian al-Biruni, it is surmised that an early Bhil tribal group settlement was known as Ashaval.

According to Merutunga, Karna, the Chaulukya (Solanki) ruler of Anhilvada (modern Patan), successfully launched a military campaign against Ashaval and founded a city nearby called Karnavati. The location of Karnavati is not definitively known. References from the 14th and 15th centuries mention Ashaval but do not mention Karnavati.

Ahmad Shah I of the Gujarat Sultanate transferred its capital from Anhilvada to Ashaval in 1411 CE; as was custom, the city was subsequently renamed Ahmedabad after the Sultan.

=== Early history ===
The area around Ahmedabad has been inhabited since the 11th century, when it was known as &quot;Ashaval&quot;. At that time, Karna, the Chaulukya (Solanki) ruler of Anhilwara (modern Patan), waged a successful war against the Bhil king of Ashaval, and established a city called &quot;Karnavati&quot; on the banks of the Sabarmati. Solanki rule lasted until the 13th century, when Gujarat came under the control of the Vaghela dynasty of Dholka. Gujarat subsequently came under the control of the Delhi Sultanate in the 14th century. However, by the earlier 15th century, the local Muslim governor Zafar Khan Muzaffar established his independence from the Delhi Sultanate and crowned himself Sultan of Gujarat as Muzaffar Shah I, thereby founding the Muzaffarid dynasty. In 1411, the area came under the control of his grandson, Sultan Ahmed Shah, who selected the forested area along the banks of the Sabarmati river for his new capital. He laid the foundation of a new walled city near Karnavati and named it Ahmedabad after himself. According to other versions, he named the city after four Muslim saints in the area who all had the name Ahmed. Ahmed Shah I laid the foundation of the city on 26 February 1411 (at 1.20 pm, Thursday, the second day of Dhu al-Qi&#x27;dah, Hijri year 813) at Manek Burj. Manek Burj is named after the legendary 15th-century Hindu saint, Maneknath, who intervened to help Ahmed Shah I build Bhadra Fort in 1411. Ahmed Shah I chose it as the new capital on 4 March 1411. Chandan and Rajesh Nath, 13th generation descendants of Saint Maneknath, perform &quot;puja&quot; and hoist the flag on Manek Burj on Ahmedabad&#x27;s foundation day and for the Vijayadashami festival every year.

In 1487, Mahmud Begada, the grandson of Ahmed Shah, fortified the city with an outer wall in circumference and consisting of twelve gates, 189 bastions, and over 6,000 battlements. In 1535 Humayun briefly occupied Ahmedabad after capturing Champaner when the ruler of Gujarat, Bahadur Shah, fled to Diu. Ahmedabad was then reoccupied by the Muzaffarid dynasty until 1573 when Gujarat was conquered by the Mughal emperor Akbar. During the Mughal reign, Ahmedabad became one of the Empire&#x27;s thriving centres of trade, mainly in textiles, which were exported as far as Europe. The Mughal ruler Shah Jahan spent the prime of his life in the city, sponsoring the construction of the Moti Shahi Mahal in Shahibaug. The Deccan Famine of 1630–32 affected the city, as did famines in 1650 and 1686. Ahmedabad remained the provincial headquarters of the Mughals until 1758, when they surrendered the city to the Marathas.

=== Modern history ===

During the period of Maratha governance, the city became the centre of a conflict between the Peshwa of Poona and the Gaekwad of Baroda. In 1780, during the First Anglo-Maratha War, a British force under James Hartley stormed and captured Ahmedabad, but it was handed back to the Marathas at the end of the war. The British East India Company took over the city in 1818 during the Third Anglo-Maratha War. A military cantonment was established in 1824 and a municipal government in 1858. Incorporated into the Bombay Presidency during British rule, Ahmedabad became one of the most important cities in the Gujarat region. In 1864, a railway link between Ahmedabad and Mumbai (then Bombay) was established by the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway (BB&amp;CI), enabling traffic and trade between northern and southern India via the city. Over time, the city established itself as the home of a developing textile industry, which earned it the nickname &quot;Manchester of the East&quot;.

The Indian independence movement developed roots in the city when Mahatma Gandhi established two ashrams – the Kochrab Ashram near Paldi in 1915 and the Satyagraha Ashram (now Sabarmati Ashram) on the banks of the Sabarmati in 1917 – which would become centres of nationalist activities. During the mass protests against the Rowlatt Act in 1919, textile workers burned down 51 government buildings across the city in protest at a British attempt to extend wartime regulations after the First World War. In the 1920s, textile workers and teachers went on strike, demanding civil rights and better pay and working conditions. In 1930, Gandhi initiated the Salt Satyagraha from Ahmedabad by embarking from his ashram on the Dandi Salt March. The city&#x27;s administration and economic institutions were rendered inoperative in the early 1930s by the large numbers of people who took to the streets in peaceful protests, and again in 1942 during the Quit India Movement.

==== Post-Independence ====
Following independence and the partition of India in 1947, the city was scarred by the intense communal violence that broke out between Hindus and Muslims in 1947. Ahmedabad was the focus of settlement by Hindu migrants from Pakistan, who expanded the city&#x27;s population and transformed its demographics and economy.

By 1960, Ahmedabad had become a metropolis with a population of slightly under half a million people, with classical and colonial European-style buildings lining the city&#x27;s thoroughfares. It was chosen as the capital of Gujarat after the partition of the State of Bombay on 1 May 1960. During this period, a large number of educational and research institutions were founded in the city, making it a centre for higher education, science, and technology. Ahmedabad&#x27;s economic base became more diverse with the establishment of heavy and chemical industry during the same period. Many countries sought to emulate India&#x27;s economic planning strategy and one of them, South Korea, copied Ahmedabad&#x27;s second &quot;Five-Year Plan&quot;. Post independence Ahmedabad has seen development in manufacturing and infrastructure.

In the late 1970s, the capital shifted to the newly built city of Gandhinagar. This marked the start of a long period of decline in Ahmedabad, marked by a lack of development. The 1974 &quot;Navnirman&quot; agitation – a protest against a 20% hike in the hostel food fees at the L.D. College of Engineering in Ahmedabad – snowballed into a movement to remove Chimanbhai Patel, then chief minister of Gujarat. In the 1980s, a reservation policy was introduced in the country, which led to anti-reservation protests in 1981 and 1985. The protests witnessed violent clashes between people belonging to various castes. The city was considerably impacted by the 2001 Gujarat earthquake; up to 50 multi-storey buildings collapsed, killing 752 people and causing much damage. The following year, a three-day period of violence between Hindus and Muslims in the western Indian state of Gujarat, known as the 2002 Gujarat riots, spread to Ahmedabad; in eastern Chamanpura, 69 people were killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre on 28 February 2002. Refugee camps were set up around the city, housing 50,000 Muslims, as well as some small Hindu camps.

The 2008 Ahmedabad bombings, a series of seventeen bomb blasts, killed and injured several people. The terrorist group Harkat-ul-Jihad claimed responsibility for the attacks.

Ahmedabad is one of few cities in India that has hosted the premiers of major economies such as the US, China, and Canada. On 24 February 2020, President Donald Trump became the first US president to visit the city. The event was named Namaste Trump. Earlier, President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited the city.

== Demographics ==

=== Population ===

City population increased by 23.43% from 4,519,000 to 5,577,940 (2,938,985 males and 2,638,955 females resulting in a sex ratio of 898 females per 1,000 males) making Ahmedabad the fifth most populous city in India. The urban agglomeration centred upon Ahmedabad had a population of 6,352,254 and was the seventh most populous urban agglomeration in India . The population of children aged 0 to 6 was 621,034 (336,063 males and 284,971 females resulting in a child sex ratio of 848 females per 1,000 males) . The city had an average literacy rate of 88.29%, a male literacy rate of 92.30%, and a female literacy rate of 83.85%.

Estimated population of Ahmedabad city is 7,692,000 while that of the urban agglomeration area is 8,772,000 as of 2023. The 2021 census of India has been delayed to 2024-25 and the deadline to freeze administrative boundaries has been extended to 1 January 2024.

=== Poverty ===
In the mid-1970s and early 1980s, the textile mills that were responsible for much of Ahmedabad&#x27;s wealth faced competition from automation and domestic specialty looms. Several mills closed down, leaving between 40,000 and 50,000 people without a source of income, and many moved into informal settlements in the city centre. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), the governing and administrative body of the city, simultaneously lost much of its tax base and saw an increased demand for services. In the 1990s, newly emerging pharmaceutical, chemical, and automobile manufacturing industries required skilled labor, so many migrants seeking work ended up in the informal sector and settled in slums.

Ahmedabad has made efforts to reduce poverty and improve the living conditions of poor residents. The urban poverty rate has declined from 28% in 1993–1994 to 10% in 2011–2012. This is partly due to the strengthening of the AMC and its partnership with several civil society organizations (CSOs) representing poor residents. Through projects and programs, the AMC has provided utilities and basic services to slums. However, some challenges remain, and there are still many residents who lack access to sanitation, clean running water, and electricity. Riots, often rooted in religious tensions, threaten the stability of neighborhoods and have caused spatial segregation across religious and caste lines. There remains to be seen a concerted effort to balance pro-poor, inclusive development with national initiatives that aim to create &#x27;global cities&#x27; that are the focus of capital investment and technological innovation.

==== Informal housing and slums ====
As of 2011, about 66% of the population lives in formal housing, with the other 34% living in slums or &quot;chawls&quot;, which are tenements for industrial workers. There are approximately 700 slum settlements in Ahmedabad and 11% of the total housing stock is public housing. The population of Ahmedabad has increased while the housing stock has remained generally constant, and this has led to a rise in density of both formal and informal housing and a more economical usage of existing space. The Indian census estimates that the Ahmedabad slum population was 25.6% of the total population in 1991 and had decreased to 4.5% in 2011, but these numbers are contested and local entities maintain that the census underestimates informal populations. There is a consensus that there has been a reduction in the percentage of the population that lives in slum settlements, and that there has also been a general improvement in living conditions for slum residents.

==== Slum Networking Project ====

In the 1990s, the AMC faced increased slum populations. They found that residents were willing and able to pay for legal connections to water, sewage, and electricity, but because of tenure issues, they were paying higher prices for low-quality, informal connections. To address this, beginning in 1995, the AMC partnered with civil society organizations to create the Slum Networking Project (SNP) to improve basic services in 60 slums, benefitting approximately 13,000 households. This project, also known as &quot;Parivartan (Change)&quot;, involved participatory planning in which slum residents were partners alongside AMC, private institutions, microfinance lenders, and local NGOs. The goal of the program was to provide both physical infrastructure (including water supply, sewers, individual toilets, paved roads, storm drainage, and tree planting) and community development (i.e. the formation of resident associations, women&#x27;s groups, community health interventions, and vocational training). In addition, participating households were granted a minimum de facto tenure of ten years. The project cost a total of 4,350 million. Community members and the private sector each contributed 600 million, NGOs provided 90 million, and the AMC paid for the rest of the project. Each slum household was responsible for no more than 12% of the cost of upgrading their home.

This project has generally been regarded as a success. Having access to basic services increased the residents&#x27; working hours, since most work out of their homes. It also reduced the incidence of illness, particularly water-borne illness, and increased children&#x27;s rates of school attendance. The SNP received the 2006 UNHABITAT Dubai International Award for Best Practice to Improve the Living Environment. However, concerns remain about the community&#x27;s responsibility and capacity for the maintenance of the new infrastructure. Additionally, trust was weakened when the AMC demolished two of slums that were upgraded as part of SNP to create recreational parks.

=== Religion and ethnicity ===
According to the 2011 census, Hindus are the predominant religious community in the city comprising 81.56% of the population followed by Muslims (13.51%), Jains (3.62%), Christians (0.85%) and Sikhs (0.24%). Buddhists, people following other religions and those who did not state any religion make up the remainder.
* The Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Mirzapur is the cathedral of the Diocese of Ahmedabad.
Most of the residents of Ahmedabad are native Gujaratis, but there is a large population with origins outside the state who speak a variety of languages, mainly Hindi and Urdu (among Muslims). There is a Sindhi community dating from Partition, and a Marathi community dating back to Maratha rule over Gujarat. The city is home to some 2,000 Parsis (Zoroastrians), and some 125 members of the Bene Israel Jewish community. There is also one synagogue in the city.

At the time of the 2011 census, 68.44% of the population spoke Gujarati, 19.49% Hindi, 3.47% Urdu, 2.24% Sindhi, 2.02% Marathi and 1.90% Marwari as their first language.

== Geography ==

Ahmedabad lies in western India at 53 metres (174 ft) above sea level on the banks of the Sabarmati river, in north-central Gujarat. It covers an area of . The Sabarmati frequently dried up in the summer, leaving only a small stream of water, and the city is in a sandy and dry area. However, with the execution of the Sabarmati River Front Project and Embankment, the waters from the Narmada river have been diverted to the Sabarmati to keep the river flowing throughout the year, thereby eliminating Ahmedabad&#x27;s water problems. The steady expansion of the Rann of Kutch threatened to increase desertification around the city area and much of the state; however, the Narmada Canal network is expected to alleviate this problem. Except for the small hills of Thaltej-Jodhpur Tekra, the city is almost flat. Three lakes lie within the city&#x27;s limits—Kankaria, Vastrapur and Chandola. Kankaria, in the neighbourhood of Maninagar, is an artificial lake developed by the Sultan of Gujarat, Qutb-ud-din, in 1451.

According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the town falls under seismic zone 3, in a scale of 2 to 5 (in order of increasing vulnerability to earthquakes).

Ahmedabad is divided by the Sabarmati into two physically distinct eastern and western regions. The eastern bank of the river houses the old city, which includes the central town of Bhadra. This part of Ahmedabad is characterised by packed bazaars, the &quot;pol&quot; system of closely clustered buildings, and numerous places of worship. A pol (pronounced as pole) is a housing cluster which comprises many families of a particular group, linked by caste, profession, or religion. This is a list of pols in the old walled city of Ahmedabad in Gujarat, India. Heritage of these pols has helped Ahmedabad gain a place in UNESCO&#x27;s Tentative Lists, in selection criteria II, III and IV. The secretary-general of EuroIndia Centre quoted that if 12,000 homes of Ahmedabad are restored they could be very helpful in promoting heritage tourism and its allied businesses. The &quot;Art Reverie&quot; in &quot;Moto Sutharvado&quot; is Res Artis center. The first pol in Ahmedabad was named &quot;Mahurat Pol&quot;. The old city also houses the main railway station, the main post office, and some buildings of the Muzaffarid and British eras. The colonial period saw the expansion of the city to the western side of the Sabarmati river, facilitated by the construction of Ellis Bridge in 1875 (and later the modern Nehru Bridge). The western part of the city houses educational institutions, modern buildings, residential areas, shopping malls, multiplexes and new business districts centred around roads such as Ashram Road, C. G. Road, and Sarkhej-Gandhinagar Highway.

The Sabarmati Riverfront is a waterfront area being developed along the banks of the Sabarmati river in Ahmedabad, India. Proposed in the 1960s, its construction began in 2005, and it opened in 2012.

=== Climate ===
Ahmedabad has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: BSh), with marginally less rain than required for a tropical savanna climate. There are three main seasons: summer, monsoon, and winter. Aside from the monsoon season, the climate is extremely dry. The weather is hot from March to June; the average summer maximum is , and the average minimum is . From November to February, the average maximum temperature is , and the average minimum is . Cold winds from the north are responsible for a mild chill in January. The southwest monsoon brings a humid climate from mid-June to mid-September. The average annual rainfall is about , but infrequent heavy torrential rains cause local rivers to flood and it is not uncommon for droughts to occur when the monsoon does not extend as far west as usual. The highest temperature in the city was recorded on 20 May 2016, with it reaching .
Following a heat wave in May 2010, which reached and claimed hundreds of lives, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), in partnership with an international coalition of health and academic groups and with support from the Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network, developed the Ahmedabad Heat Action Plan. Aimed at increasing awareness, sharing information and coordinating responses to reduce the health effects of heat on vulnerable populations, the action plan is the first comprehensive plan in Asia to address the threat of adverse heat on health. It also focuses on community participation, building public awareness of the risks of extreme heat, training medical and community workers to respond to and help prevent heat-related illnesses, and coordinating an interagency emergency response effort when heat waves hit.

Ahmedabad has been ranked 7th best “National Clean Air City” (under Category 1 &gt;10L Population cities) in India according to &#x27;Swachh Vayu Survekshan 2024 Results&#x27; 

=== Cityscape ===

Early in Ahmedabad&#x27;s history, under Ahmed Shah, builders fused Hindu craftsmanship with Persian architecture, giving rise to the Indo-Saracenic style. Many mosques in the city were built in this fashion. Sidi Saiyyed Mosque was built in the last year of the Sultanate of Gujarat. It is entirely arched and has ten stone latticework windows or jali on the side and rear arches. Private mansions or haveli from this era have carvings. A pol is a typical housing cluster of Old Ahmedabad.

After independence, modern buildings appeared in Ahmedabad. Architects given commissions in the city included Louis Kahn, who designed the IIM-A; Le Corbusier, who designed the Shodhan and Sarabhai Villas, the Sanskar Kendra and the Mill Owners&#x27; Association Building, and Frank Lloyd Wright, who designed the administrative building of Calico Mills and the Calico Dome. B. V. Doshi came to the city from Paris to supervise Le Corbusier&#x27;s works and later set up the School of Architecture (now CEPT). His local works include Sangath, Amdavad ni Gufa, Tagore Memorial Hall and the School of Architecture. Charles Correa, who became a partner of Doshi&#x27;s, designed the Gandhi Ashram and Achyut Kanvinde, and the Ahmedabad Textile Industry&#x27;s Research Association complex. Christopher Charles Benninger&#x27;s first work, the Alliance Française, is located in the Ellis Bridge area. Anant Raje designed major additions to Louis Kahn&#x27;s IIM-A campus, namely the Ravi Mathai Auditorium and KLMD.

Some of the most visited gardens in the city include Law Garden, Victoria Garden, and Bal Vatika. Law Garden was named after the College of Law located nearby. Victoria Garden is located at the southern edge of the Bhadra Fort and contains a statue of Queen Victoria. Bal Vatika is a children&#x27;s park situated on the grounds of Kankaria Lake and houses an amusement park. Other gardens in the city include Parimal Garden, Usmanpura Garden, Prahlad Nagar Garden, and Lal Darwaja Garden. Ahmedabad&#x27;s Kamla Nehru Zoological Park houses a number of endangered species including flamingoes, caracals, Asiatic wolves, and chinkara.

The Kankaria Lake, built in 1451 CE, is one of the biggest lakes in Ahmedabad. In earlier days, it was known by the name &quot;Qutub Hoj&quot; or &quot;Hauj-e-Kutub&quot;. Lal Bahadur Shastri lake in Bapunagar is almost 136,000 square metres. In 2010, another 34 lakes were planned in and around Ahmedabad of which five lakes will be developed by AMC; the other 29 will be developed by the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA). Vastrapur Lake is a small artificial lake located in the western part of Ahmedabad. Beautified by local authorities in 2002, it is surrounded by greenery and paved walkways and has become a popular leisure spot for the citizens. Chandola Lake covers an area of 1200 hectares. It is home to cormorants, painted storks, and spoonbills. During the evening time, many people visit this place and take a leisurely stroll. There is a recently developed lake in Naroda, and there is also the world&#x27;s largest collection of antique cars in Kathwada at IB farm (Dastan Farm). AMC has also developed the Sabarmati Riverfront.

Other public transit options include the Ahmedabad BRTS, also known as &quot;Janmarg&quot; (people&#x27;s way), a bus rapid transit system inaugurated in October 2009 with a total fleet of 325 buses over 19 routes and a daily ridership of 190,000. Bus transportation is also provided by Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service (AMTS) with 700 buses over 149 routes. Both the Ahmedabad BRTS and the AMTS are overseen by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. Ahmedabad also has self drive car rental service provided by private companies like Just Drive Self Drive Cars.

The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation introduced &quot;AmdaBike,&quot; a public bicycle sharing system, in December 2019 to improve last mile connectivity. MYBYK is the main service provider for AmdaBike with 300 bicycle stations—including at Ahmedabad BRTS stations—and 4,000 bicycles.

=== Road ===
National Highway 48 passes through Ahmedabad and connects it with New Delhi and Mumbai. The National Highway 147 also links Ahmedabad to Gandhinagar. It is connected to Vadodara through National Expressway 1, a -long expressway with two exits. This expressway is part of the Golden Quadrilateral project.

In 2001, Ahmedabad was ranked as the most-polluted city in India out of 85 cities by the Central Pollution Control Board. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board gave auto rickshaw drivers an incentive of 10,000 to convert the fuel of all 37,733 auto rickshaws in Ahmedabad to cleaner-burning compressed natural gas to reduce pollution. As a result, in 2008, Ahmedabad was ranked as the 50th most-polluted city in India.

== Sports ==

Cricket is one of the most popular sports in the city. Narendra Modi Stadium, also known as the Motera Stadium, originally &quot;Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium&quot; built in 1982, hosts both one day internationals and test matches. It is the largest stadium in the world by capacity, with a seating capacity of 132,000 spectators. It hosted the 1987, 1996, 2011, and 2023 Cricket World Cups. It is the home ground of the Gujarat cricket team, a first-class team, which competes in domestic tournaments. Ahmedabad has a second cricket stadium at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation&#x27;s Sports Club of Gujarat. The final of 2023 Cricket World cup was held at the Narendra Modi Stadium. Ahmedabad is also home to the IPL team Gujarat Titans, who won its first title in 2022 in front of its home crowd.

Other popular sports include field hockey, badminton, tennis, squash and golf. Ahmedabad has nine golf courses. Mithakhali Multi Sports Complex is being developed by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation to promote various indoor sports. Ahmedabad has also hosted national level games for roller skating and table tennis. Kart racing is gaining popularity in the city, with the introduction of a 380 metre long track based on Formula One design concepts.
Sabarmati Marathon has been organized every year December–January since 2011; it has categories like a full and half-marathon, a 7 km dream run, a 5 km run for the visually disabled, and a 5 km wheelchair run. In 2007, Ahmedabad hosted the 51st national level shooting games. The 2016 Kabaddi World Cup was held in Ahmedabad at The Arena by Transtadia (a renovated Kankaria football ground). Geet Sethi, a five-time winner of the World Professional Billiards Championship and a recipient of India&#x27;s highest sporting award, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna, was raised in Ahmedabad.

The Adani Ahmedabad Marathon has been organized by the Adani Group every year since 2017; it attracted 8,000 participants in its first edition and also hosted its first virtual marathon in 2020 in compliance with COVID-19 guidelines.

=== 2036 Olympics ===
Ahmedabad has been identified as a potential host city for the 2036 Summer Olympics. The Gujarat government has identified 33 sites in and around Ahmedabad for the development of infrastructure to support the Olympic bid. The city&#x27;s bid is also being shaped with international expertise, including Australian consultants. A Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is being set up by the Gujarat government to manage Ahmedabad&#x27;s bid for the games. The fate of the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium is under consideration as part of the city&#x27;s preparation for the Olympics.

<text>Adherents of Zoroastrianism use three distinct versions of traditional calendars for liturgical purposes. Those all derive from medieval Iranian calendars and ultimately are based on the Babylonian calendar as used in the Achaemenid empire. &quot;Qadimi&quot; (&quot;ancient&quot;) is a traditional reckoning introduced in 1006. &quot;Shahanshahi&quot; (&quot;imperial&quot;) is a calendar reconstructed from the 10th century text &quot;Denkard&quot;. &quot;Fasli&quot; is a term for a 1906 adaptation of the 11th century Jalali calendar following a proposal by Kharshedji Rustomji Cama made in the 1860s.

A number of Calendar eras are in use:
*A tradition of counting years from the birth of Zoroaster was reported from India in the 19th century. There was a dispute between factions variously preferring an era of 389 BCE, 538 BCE, or 637 BCE.
*The &quot;Yazdegerdi era&quot; (also &quot;Yazdegirdi&quot; or &quot;Yazdgerdi&quot;) counts from the accession of the last Sassanid ruler, Yazdegerd III (16 June 632 CE). This convention was proposed by Cama in the 1860s but has since also been used in conjunctions with Qadimi or Shahanshahi reckoning. An alternative &quot;Magian era&quot; (&quot;era Magorum&quot; or &quot;Tarikh al-majus&quot;) was set at the date of Yazdegerd&#x27;s death in 652.
*&quot;Z.E.R.&quot; or &quot;Zarathushtrian Religious Era&quot; is a convention introduced in 1990 by the Zarathushtrian Assembly of California set at the vernal equinox (Nowruz) of 1738 BCE (−1737 in the astronomical year numbering).

==History==
===Achaemenid period===

The Babylonian calendar was used in the Achaemenid Empire by the 4th century BCE for civil purposes.
The earliest Zoroastrian calendar (also misleadingly called &quot;Avestan calendar&quot;) follows the Babylonian in relating the seventh and other days of the month to Ahura Mazda.

Like many ancient calendars, the Babylonian calendar was lunisolar.
It used an intercalary month roughly once every six years.

In the civil calendar, intercalations did not always follow a regular pattern, but during the reign of Artaxerxes II (circa 380 BCE) astronomers utilised a 19-year cycle which required the addition of a month called Addaru II in years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14 and 19, and the month Ululu II in year 17 of the cycle.

The first known intercalation is recorded for 309 BCE.
The first month of the year was called Frawardin, and the first day of Frawardin was the &#x27;New Year&#x27;s Day&#x27; or &quot;Nawruz&quot;, from which all other religious observances were reckoned – this day being, in theory, the day of the northern vernal equinox.

A 365-day calendar, with months largely identical to the Egyptian calendar, was introduced shortly after the conquest of Egypt by the Achaemenid ruler Cambyses (&quot;c.&quot; 525 BCE).

Scholars are divided on whether this 365 day calendar was in fact preceded by a 360-day calendar of Zoroastrian observances.

===Hellenistic period===
Following Alexander&#x27;s invasion of Persia in 330 BCE, the Seleucid (312–248 BCE) instituted the Hellenic practice of counting years from the start of a fixed era, as opposed using regnal years.

The regnal era of Alexander is now referred to as the Seleucid era.

The Parthians (150–224 CE), who succeeded the Seleucids, continued the Seleucid/Hellenic tradition.

===Parthian to Sassanid period===
In 224 CE, when the Babylonian calendar was replaced by the Zoroastrian, 1 Frawardin and the New Year celebration of Nawruz had drifted to 1 October. The older custom of counting regnal years from the monarch&#x27;s coronation was reinstated. At this point the calendar was realigned with the seasons by delaying the &quot;epagemonai&quot; by eight months (so that they now preceded the start of the ninth month) and adjusting the dates of the &quot;gahanbar&quot; (farming festivals) accordingly.

This caused confusion, since the new year now fell five days earlier than before, and some people continued to observe the old date. After 46 years (226–272 CE), with 1 Frawardin now on 19 September, another calendar reform was implemented by Ardashir&#x27;s grandson Hormazd I (272–273 CE). During the first years after implementation of the new Gatha days, the population had not universally adopted the new dates for religious festivals, resulting in &quot;official&quot; celebrations takings place five days earlier than popular celebrations. In later years the population had observed the Gatha days, but the original five day discrepancy persisted. Hormazd&#x27;s reform was to link the popular and official observance dates to form continual six-day feasts. Nawruz was an exception: the first and the sixth days of the month were celebrated as different occasions. &quot;Lesser Nawruz&quot; was observed on 1 Frawardin. 6 Frawardin became &quot;Greater Nawruz&quot;, a day of special festivity. Around the 10th century CE, the &quot;Greater Nawruz&quot; was associated with the return of the legendary king, Jamsed; in contemporary practice it is kept as the symbolic observance of Zoroaster&#x27;s birthday, or Khordad Sal.

Mary Boyce has argued that sometime between 399 CE and 518 CE the six-day festivals were compressed to five days. The major feasts, or gahambars, of contemporary Zoroastrian practice, are still kept as five-day observances today.

===Medieval period===

The &quot;Bundahishn&quot;, a pseudo-Avestan treatise written in the early Islamic period (8th or 9th century)
replaces the &quot;Age of Alexander&quot; with an &quot;Ageo of Zoroaster&quot;, placed &quot;258 years before Alexander&quot; (consistent with the date given by Ammianus Marcellinus).

By the reign of Yazdegird III (632–651 CE), the religious celebrations were again somewhat adrift with respect to their proper seasons. The calendar had continued to slip against the Julian calendar since the previous reform at the rate of one day every four years. Therefore, in 632, the new year was celebrated on 16 June. By the 9th century, the Zoroastrian theologian Zadspram had noted that the state of affairs was less than optimal, and estimated that at the time of Final Judgement the two systems would be out of sync by four years.

==Calendar eras==
The current mainstream Zoroastrian reckoning of years&#x27; start date is on 16 June 632 CE. Yazdegird III was the last monarch of the Sasanian dynasty, and since the custom at that time was to count regnal years since the monarch ascended the throne, the reckoning of years was continued, in the absence of a Zoroastrian monarch, under Islamic rule.

Zoroastrian dates are distinguished by the suffix Y.Z. for &quot;Yazdegirdi Era&quot;.
The usage &quot;AY&quot; is also found.

Isolated pockets of Asia Minor use an alternative reckoning of years which predates the Yazdegirdi Era, being based on a supposed date of the birth of Zoroaster on 3 March 389 BC. On this calendar, 22 July 2000 CE was the first day of Zoroastrian year 2390.

Yet another form of reckoning is the Zarathushtrian (Zoroastrian) Religious Era (Z.E.R./ZRE), adopted in 1990 CE by the Zarathushtrian Assembly of California. This is based on the putative association of the mission of Zoroaster with the dawn of the astrological Age of Aries, calculated for this purpose to have been the northern vernal equinox of 1738 BCE. Hence the year 3738 ZRE began in 2000 CE. The Zoroastrian community, both in Iran and in diaspora, have also been said to have accepted it, the former doing so in 1993 CE. A briefing paper from the Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe indicates that they recognise this usage to have been pragmatically adopted by Zoroastrians in Iran, while the diaspora continues to use the YZ system.

== Qadimi calendar ==
The Qadimi (also &quot;Qadmi, Kadimi, Kudmi&quot;) or &quot;ancient&quot; calendar is the traditional calendar in use since 1006 CE.

In 1006 CE, the month Frawardin had returned to the correct position so that 1 Frawardin coincided with the northern vernal equinox. The religious festivals were therefore returned to their traditional months, with Nawruz once again being celebrated on 1 Frawardin.

The Julian Day Number corresponding to 16 June 632 CE is 1952063.

The Julian Day Number of Nowruz, the first day, of Year &quot;Y&quot; of the Yazdegirdi Era is therefore 1952063 + (&quot;Y&quot; − 1) × 365.

22 July AD 2000 was Nowruz and the first day of 1370 Y.Z. (or 3738 ZRE) according to the Qadimi reckoning.

In the Julian year 1300 CE, 669 Y.Z. began on 1 January, and 670 Y.Z. on 31 December of the same year.

== Shahanshahi calendar ==

The Shahanshahi calendar (also &quot;Shahenshahi, Shahenshai&quot;) or &quot;imperial&quot; calendar
is the system described in &quot;Denkard&quot;, a 9th-century Zoroastrian text.
It explicitly acknowledged several methods of intercalation:
* a leap-day every 4 years;
* adding ten days every 40 years;
* a leap-month of 30 days once every 120 years;
* 5 months once every 600 years;
1,461 Zoroastrian years equal 1,460 Julian years.

The Denkard then states:
:The time of six hours should be kept apart from (i.e. not to be added to) the last days of the year for many years, till (the hours) amount to (a definite period of time) ... And it is the admonition of the good faith that the rectification (of the calendar) should not be made till a month is completed (i.e. till the additional six hours every year amount to a month at the end of a hundred and twenty. years). And more than a period of five months should not be allowed (to accumulate.) [Parentheses appear as in original.]

&quot;The Denkard&quot; – which was not Zoroastrian scripture but a religious manual – therefore favoured the solution of a leap-month once every 120 years, with a fall-back of adding 5 months after 600 years if this were missed. This practice was not, however, adopted by Zoroastrians living in Islamic Persia.

The Parsis had knowledge of &quot;The Denkard&#x27;s&quot; proposal: at some point between 1125 and 1129, the Parsi-Zoroastrians of the Indian subcontinent inserted such an embolismic month, named &quot;Aspandarmad vahizak&quot; (the month of Aspandarmad but with the suffix &quot;vahizak&quot;). That month would also be the last month intercalated: subsequent generations of Parsis neglected to insert a thirteenth month.

Around 1720 CE, an Iranian Zoroastrian priest named Jamasp Peshotan Velati travelled from Iran to India. Upon his arrival, he discovered that there was a difference of a month between the Parsi calendar and his own calendar. Velati brought this discrepancy to the attention of the priests of Surat, but no consensus as to which calendar was correct was reached. Around 1740 CE, some influential priests argued that since their visitor had been from the ancient &#x27;homeland&#x27;, his version of the calendar must be correct, and their own must be wrong. On 6 June 1745 CE (Julian), a number of Parsis in and around Surat adopted the calendar which had continued in use in Iran, now to be identified as the Qadimi reckoning. Other Parsis continued to use the reckoning which had become traditional in India, and call their calendar &quot;Shahanshahi&quot;.

Arzan Lali the author of Zoroastrian Calendar Services (ZCS) website (zcserv.com) comments that &quot;... adherents of other variants of the Zoroastrian calendar denigrate the Shenshai or Shahenshahi as &#x27;royalist&#x27;.&quot;

21 August 2000 CE was Nawruz, and the first day of 1370 Y.Z. (or 3738 ZRE) according to the Shahanshahi reckoning.

Because the one-off intercalation of 30 days happened sometime before the Nawruz of 1129 CE, we can be confident that in that Julian year, 498 YZ began on 12 February by the Qadimi reckoning, but 14 March by the recently introduced Shahanshahi.

The Julian Day Number of Nawruz, the first day, of all subsequent Shahanshahi years &quot;Y&quot; of the Yazdegirdi Era is therefore 1952093 + (&quot;Y&quot; − 1) × 365.

== Fasli calendar ==
At the start of the 20th century, Khurshedji Cama, a Bombay Parsi, founded the &quot;Zarthosti Fasili Sal Mandal&quot;, or Zoroastrian Seasonal-Year Society. In 1906, the society published its proposal for a Zoroastrian calendar which was synchronised with the seasons. This &quot;Fasli&quot; calendar, as it became known, was based on the Jalali calendar introduced in 1079 during the reign of the Seljuk Malik Shah and which had been well received in agrarian communities.

The Fasli proposal had two useful features: a leap-day once every four years, and harmony with the tropical year. The leap-day, called &quot;Avardad-sal-Gah&quot; (or in Pahlavi: &quot;Ruzevahizak&quot;), would be inserted, when required, after the five existing &quot;Gatha&quot; days at the end of the year. New Year&#x27;s Day would be kept on the northward vernal equinox, and if the leap-day was applied correctly, would not drift away from the spring. The &quot;Fasli&quot; society also claimed that their calendar was an accurate religious calendar, as opposed to the other two calendars, which they asserted were only political.

The new calendar received little support from the Indian Zoroastrian community, since it was considered to contradict the injunctions expressed in the Denkard. In Iran, however, the &quot;Fasli&quot; calendar gained momentum following a campaign in 1930 to persuade the Iranian Zoroastrians to adopt it, under the title of the &quot;Bastani&quot; (traditional) calendar. In AD 1925, the Iranian Parliament had introduced a new Iranian calendar, which (independent of the &quot;Fasli&quot; movement) incorporated both points proposed by the Fasili Society, and since the Iranian national calendar had also retained the Zoroastrian names of the months, it was not a big step to integrate the two. The &quot;Bastani&quot; calendar was duly accepted by many of the Zoroastrians. Many orthodox Iranian Zoroastrians, especially the Sharifabadis of Yazd, continued to use the Qadimi, however.

In 1906 CE, Nawruz of 1276 Y.Z. fell on 15 August for followers of the Qadimi calendar, and 14 September for those observing Shahanshahi. There was therefore a six-month gap between the Fasli and Qadimi New Year observances, and a seven-month gap to the Shahanshahi.

Since there is exactly one Fasli year for every Gregorian year, then day one of the proleptic Fasli calendar would be 21 March (Gregorian) 631 CE, with Year 2 beginning on 21 March 632 CE. But Yazdegird III did not ascend the throne until 19 June 632 CE (Gregorian), leading to the curious quirk that the base date for the reckoning of years ends up in Year 2 of the Fasli calendar.

=== Festivals in leap years ===
The Zoroastrian year, in Qadimi and Shahanshahi observance, concludes with ten days in memory of departed souls: five &quot;Mukhtad&quot; days on the last 5 days of the 12th month, and five more Mukhtad days, which are also the five-day festival of &quot;Hamaspathmaidyem&quot;, on the five Gatha days. The penultimate day of the twelfth month is &quot;Mareshpand Jashan&quot;.

In a common year (non-leap year) of the Fasli observance, Mukhtad is observed 11–20 March, with Hamaspathmaidyem and the Gatha days 16–20 March. Mareshpand Jashan is on 14 March.

In a leap year of the Fasli observance, Mukhtad is observed 10–19 March, with Hamaspathmaidyem and the Gatha days 15–19 March. Mareshpand Jashan is on 13 March. The leap day, 20 March, called &quot;Avardad-sal-Gah&quot;, is considered a duplication of &quot;Wahishtoisht&quot;, the fifth Gatha day, but is not reckoned as Mukhtad or Hamaspathmaidyem.

=== Relationship with the Gregorian calendar ===
21 March 2000 CE was Nowruz and the first day of 1370 Y.Z. (or 3738 ZRE) according to the Fasli reckoning.

Ali Jafarey describes the Fasli calendar as
:... an almost tropical calendar. It is corrected by observing the leap year.

Webster&#x27;s online dictionary and various unreferenced sources state that the Fasli calendar follows the Gregorian, and it is shown strictly following the Gregorian calendar in the period AD 2009–2031 in the tables published by R. E. Kadva. The Gregorian calendar itself, however, will not keep 21 March as the date of the northern vernal equinox forever – it has a deviation of one day every 5025 years.

=== Relationship with the Iranian calendar ===
The civil calendar in Iran since 31 March 1925 CE has been the Solar Hejri calendar. This is strictly tied to the actual northward equinox, rather than a mathematical approximation to it. An Iranian day is reckoned to begin at midnight. Iranian time is 3.5 hours ahead of GMT. New Year&#x27;s Day is defined to be the day, as reckoned by Iranian time, when the northward equinox (the precise moment in time when northern and southern hemispheres of the Earth pass through the point of the Earth&#x27;s orbit when they are equally illuminated by the Sun) occurs on or before noon &quot;of that day&quot;, or during the 12 hours following the noon &quot;of the preceding day&quot;. This means that the pattern of leap years in the Iranian calendar is complex – usually following a 33-year cycle where the leap day is inserted every fourth year, but in year 33 instead of year 32, but with occasional 29 year cycles.

From 1960 to 1995, the northward equinox always fell at such a time that New Year&#x27;s Day in Iran occurred on the day called 21 March in the Western calendar. But this equivalence was not always true before March 1960, and the exact correspondence broke down again in 1996. In 1959, and at four-year intervals back to 1927, Iranian New Year&#x27;s Day fell on 22 March in the Gregorian calendar. In 1996, and subsequent Gregorian leap years, Iranian New Year&#x27;s Day falls on 20 March. The pattern will shift back to a matching set of leap years in 2096 CE.

The sources cited above state that the Fasli calendar both &quot;follows the Gregorian&quot; and was such that &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day coincided with vernal equinox&quot;. These two statements are incompatible. The Fasli calendar cannot track both the Gregorian leap years and strictly start on the vernal equinox; further, any calendar strictly tied to the &#x27;day of the equinox&#x27; must define when the day starts and ends, which depends on longitude-

A briefing paper from the Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe indicates that
:... the Irani Zoroastrian calendar does not shift and commences on 21 March. But it is important to note that all Iranians including Zoroastrians celebrate NoRuz (Nawruz) on the actual day of the northward equinox, therefore some years it can be 20 / 22 March.

== Astronomical and mystical aspects ==

The three different Zoroastrian calendar-traditions are similar with regard to the principle of the beginning of the months. They are structurally similar to the Armenian calendar and the Mayan Haab calendar, but different from the Iranian (Jalaali) calendar, the Julian calendar, and the French Revolutionary Calendar, whose epochs of the months are fixed to equinoxes/solstices, as are the signs of western astrology. The Qadimi and the Shahanshahi Zoroastrian calendar use merely five epagomenal days, similar to the French Revolutionary and the Coptic calendar, (although these last two have a sixth epagemonal day every leap year), so their year count slowly travels through the tropical year.

The naming of the months recalls the time of the origination of the Zoroastrian calendar. According to Mary Boyce,
:It seems a reasonable surmise that Nawruz, the holiest of them all, with deep doctrinal significance, was founded by Zoroaster himself.

== Future developments ==
The Fasli calendar has become very popular outside India, especially in the West, but many Parsis believe that adding a leap day is against the rules, and they mostly continue to use the Shahanshahi calendar. There is a proposal to correct matters by restoring the leap month, but unless this happens, the Shahanshahi and Qadimi years will continue to start earlier and earlier ... the unrevised Qadimi calendar would eventually coincide with the Fasli calendar in Gregorian year 2508, the Shahanshahi New Year will next fall on 21 March in 2632.

In 1992, all three calendars happened to have the first day of a month on the same day. Many Zoroastrians suggested a consolidation of the calendars: no consensus could be reached, though some took this opportunity to switch to the Fasli observance. Some priests objected on the grounds that if they were to switch, the religious implements they utilised would require re-consecration, at not insignificant expense.

It has also been proposed that the Shahanshahi calendar could be brought back into harmony through the intercalation of whole months.

In the UK, most Zoroastrians are Indians who follow the Shahanshahi calendar. Nevertheless, noting that Iranian Zoroastrians mostly follow the Fasli calendar, the Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe marks observances of both calendars.

== Naming of months and days ==

Zoroastrian practice divides time into years (sal or sol), months (mah), weeks, days (ruz, roz, or roj) and watches (gah or geh).
A day is reckoned to begin at dawn, as attested by Chapter 25 of the 9th century work, the Bundahishn; morning hours before dawn are assigned to the previous calendar day. Each day is divided into five watches:
* Hawan(sunrise to noon)
* Rapithwin or Second Hawan (noon to 3 p.m.)
* Uzerin (3 p.m. to sunset)
* Aiwisruthrem (sunset to midnight)
* Ushahin (midnight to sunrise)

In medieval times, according to the Bundahishn, in winter there were only four periods, with Hawan extending from daybreak until Uziran, with the omission of Rapithwan.

The months and the days of the month in the Zoroastrian calendar are dedicated to, and named after, a divinity or divine concept. The religious importance of the calendar dedications is very significant. Not only does the calendar establish the hierarchy of the major divinities, it ensures the frequent invocation of their names since the divinities of both day and month are mentioned at every Zoroastrian act of worship.

=== Day names ===
The tradition of naming the days and months after divinities was based on a similar Egyptian custom, and dates from when the calendar was set up. &quot;The last evidence for the use ... with Old Persian month-names ... comes from 458 BCE, ... after which the Elamite tablets cease.&quot; No dated West-Iranian documents from this period survive, but the fact that the Zoroastrian calendar was created at this time can be inferred from its use in a number of far-flung lands which had formerly been parts of the Achaemenid Empire.

The oldest (though not dateable) testimony for the existence of the day dedications comes from &quot;Yasna&quot; 16, a section of the Yasna liturgy that is – for the most part – a veneration to the 30 divinities with day-name dedications. The &quot;Siroza&quot; – a two-part Avesta text with individual dedications to the 30 calendar divinities – has the same sequence.

The quaternary dedication to Ahura Mazda was perhaps a compromise between orthodox and heterodox factions, with the 8th, 15th and 23rd day of the calendar perhaps originally having been dedicated to Apam Napat, Haoma, and Dahmān Afrīn. The dedication to the Ahuric Apam Napat would almost certainly have been an issue for devotees of Aredvi Sura Anahita, whose shrine cult was enormously popular between the 4th century BCE and the 3rd century CE and who is (accretions included) a functional equal of Apam Napat. To this day these three divinities are considered &#x27;extra-calendary&#x27; divinities inasfar as they are invoked together with the other 27, so making a list of 30 discrete entities.

The 2nd through 7th days are dedicated to the Amesha Spentas, the six &#x27;divine sparks&#x27; through whom all subsequent creation was accomplished, and who – in present-day Zoroastrianism - are the archangels.

Days 9 through 13 are dedications to five yazatas of the litanies (&quot;Niyayeshes&quot;): Fire (&quot;Atar&quot;), Water (&quot;Apo&quot;), Sun (&quot;Hvar&quot;), Moon (&quot;Mah&quot;), the star Sirius (Tištrya) that here perhaps represents the firmament in its entirety. Day 14 is dedicated to the soul of the Ox (&quot;Geush Urvan&quot;), linked with and representing all animal creation.

Day 16, leading the second half of the days of the month, is dedicated to the divinity of oath, Mithra (like Apam Napat of the Ahuric triad). He is followed by those closest to him, Sraoša and Rašnu, likewise judges of the soul; the representatives of which, the Fravashi(s), come next. Verethragna, Rāman, Vāta are respectively the hypostases of victory, the breath of life, and the (other) divinity of the wind and &#x27;space&#x27;.

The last group represent the more &#x27;abstract&#x27; emanations: Religion (&quot;Daena&quot;), Recompense (&quot;Ashi&quot;), and Justice (&quot;Arshtat&quot;); Sky (&quot;Asman&quot;) and Earth (&quot;Zam&quot;); Sacred Invocation (&quot;Manthra Spenta&quot;) and Endless Light (&quot;Anaghra Raocha&quot;). 

In present-day use, the day and month names are the Middle Persian equivalents of the divine names or the concepts, but in some cases reflect Semitic influences (for instance Tištrya appears as Tir, which Boyce (1982:31–33) asserts is derived from Nabu-*Tiri). The names of the 8th, 15th, and 23rd day of the month – reflecting Babylonian practice of dividing the month into four periods – can today be distinguished from one another: These three days are named &quot;Dae-pa Adar&quot;, &quot;Dae-pa Mehr&quot;, and &quot;Dae-pa Din&quot;, Middle Persian expressions meaning &#x27;Creator of&#x27; (respectively) Atar, Mithra, and Daena.

What might loosely be called &quot;weeks&quot; are the divisions of days 1–7, 8–14, 15–22, and 23–30 of each month – two weeks of seven days followed by two weeks of eight. The Gatha days at the end of the year do not belong to any such week.

=== Month names ===
Twelve divinities to whom days of the month are dedicated also have months dedicated to them. The month dedicated to Ahura Mazda is a special case – that month is named after Mazda&#x27;s stock epithet, &quot;Creator&quot; (Avestan &quot;Dadvah&quot;, whence Zoroastrian Middle Persian &quot;Dae&quot;), rather than after His proper name.

Seven of the twelve month-names occur at various points in the surviving Avesta texts, but an enumeration similar to the ones for day names does not exist in scripture. Lists of month names are however known from commentaries on the Avesta texts, from various regional Zoroastrian calendars of the 3rd to 7th centuries, and from living usage. That these names have an Old Iranian origin and are not merely Middle Iranian innovations may be inferred from the fact that several regional variants reflect Old Iranian genitive singular forms, that is, they preserve an implicit &quot;(month) of&quot;.

The month-names (with Avestan language names in parentheses), in the ordinal sequence used today, are:

The days on which day-name and month-name dedications intersect are festival days (name-day feast days) of special worship. Because Ahura Mazda has four day-name dedications, the month dedicated to Him has four intersections (the first, eighth, fifteenth and twenty-third day of the tenth month). The others have one intersection each, for example, the nineteenth day of the first month is the day of special worship of the Fravashis.

There is some evidence that suggests that in ancient practice &quot;Dae&quot; was the first month of the year, and &quot;Frawardin&quot; the last. In a 9th century text, Zoroaster&#x27;s age at the time of his death is stated to have been 77 years and 40 days (&quot;Zadspram&quot; 23.9), but the &quot;40 days&quot; do not correspond to the difference between the traditional &quot;death day&quot; (11th of &quot;Dae&quot;) and &quot;birthday&quot; (6th of &quot;Frawardin&quot;) unless &quot;Dae&quot; had once been the first month of the year and &quot;Frawardin&quot; the last. The festival of &quot;Frawardigan&quot; is held on the last days of the year, instead of following the name-day feast of the Fravashis (nineteenth day of the month of Frawardin, and also called &quot;Frawardigan&quot;)..

<text>James McCosh (April 1, 1811 – November 16, 1894) was a philosopher of the Scottish School of Common Sense. He was president of Princeton University 1868–88.

==Biography==

McCosh was born into a Covenanting family in Ayrshire, and studied at the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, obtaining his M.A. at the latter, at the suggestion of Sir William Hamilton, for an essay on stoicism. He became a minister of the Church of Scotland in 1834, serving as minister first at Abbey Church in Arbroath and then at Brechin. He sided with the Free Church of Scotland in the Disruption of 1843, becoming minister at Brechin&#x27;s new East Free Church. In 1850 or 1851 he was appointed Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at Queen&#x27;s College, Belfast (now Queen&#x27;s University Belfast).

In 1868 he travelled to the United States to become president of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). He resigned the presidency in 1888, but continued to teach philosophy until his death. McCosh Hall (home of the English department) and a cross-campus walkway are named in his honor. The campus infirmary is named after his wife, Isabella McCosh. A school on the South Side of Chicago was named after him, but has since been renamed the Emmett Louis Till Math &amp; Science Academy.

He was immortalised by William Makepeace Thackeray in the ballad of &quot;The Last Irish Grievance&quot;.

==Philosophical work==
McCosh&#x27;s position was mainly in the tradition of Thomas Reid and other Scottish common-sense philosophers. He denied that our beliefs about the nature of the external world rest on causal or other inferences from perceptual ideas, but held that they are the direct accompaniments of sensation, and thus not open to question. He also argued for the &quot;a priori&quot; nature of fundamental principles such as those of causality and morality. Our judgements and other cognitions are regulated by such principles, though that is not to say that everyone is aware of them; they can be reached through reflection on our experience, when they are recognised as self-evidently necessary. In his moral theory, especially, McCosh differed from many of his contemporaries in being relatively uninfluenced by Kant.

==Evolution==
McCosh&#x27;s most original work concerned the attempt to reconcile evolution and Christianity. In 1874, Charles Hodge, the theologian and intellectual leader at the Presbyterian Seminary in Princeton, published &quot;What is Darwinism?&quot;, claiming that Darwinism, was, in essence, atheism. To Hodge, Darwinism was contrary to the notion of design and was therefore clearly atheistic. Hodge&#x27;s views determined the position of the Seminary until his death in 1878. Hodge simply refused to accept that natural laws alone could create complex organisms that fit into their niches so perfectly and that evolution could explain origins. While he did not consider all evolutionary ideas to be in conflict with his religion, he was concerned with its teaching in colleges. Meanwhile at the college across town (a totally separate institution) President John Maclean also rejected Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution. However in 1868, McCosh became president at the college. McCosh realized that much of Darwinism could and would be proved sound, and so he strove to prepare Christians for this event. Instead of conflict between science and religion, McCosh sought reconciliation. Insisting on the principle of design in nature, McCosh interpreted the Darwinian discoveries as more evidence of the prearrangement, skill, and purpose in the universe. He thus demonstrated that Darwinism was not atheistic nor in irreconcilable hostility to the Bible. McCosh thus argued that evolution, far from being inconsistent with belief in divine design, glorifies the divine designer (see for example his &quot;Christianity and Positivism&quot;), believing nature was entirely interconnected by natural laws God was immanent with. This aspect of his work found popularity among most Presbyterian clergy, who found his arguments useful in their attempts to cope with scientific philosophy. The Presbyterians in America thus could choose between two schools of thought on evolution, both based in Princeton. The Seminary held to Hodge&#x27;s position until his supporters were ousted in 1929, and the college (Princeton University) became a world class center of the new science of evolutionary biology.

The debate between McCosh as president of the college and Charles Hodge, head of Princeton Seminary, during the late 1860s and 1870s exemplified the classic conflict between science and religion over the question of Darwin&#x27;s evolution theory. McCosh offered the first public endorsement of evolution by an American religious leader. However, the two men showed greater similarities regarding matters of science and religion than popularly appreciated. Both supported the increasing role of scientific inquiry in natural history and resisted its intrusion into philosophy and religion. The debate vitalized the college.

He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1871.

<doc id="206346" wikidata="Q15474" url="?curid=206346" title="Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet">
<text>Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet FRSE (8 March 1788 – 6 May 1856) was a Scottish metaphysician. He is often referred to as William Stirling Hamilton of Preston, in reference to his mother, Elizabeth Stirling.

==Early life==
He was born in rooms at the University of Glasgow, He was from an academic family: his father Professor William Hamilton, had in 1781, on the recommendation of William Hunter, been appointed to succeed his own father, Dr Thomas Hamilton, as Regius Professor of Anatomy, Glasgow; he died in 1790, aged 32. William Hamilton and his younger brother, Thomas Hamilton, were brought up by their mother.

Hamilton received his early education at Glasgow Grammar School, except for two years which he spent in a private school at Chiswick in Kent, and in 1807 went as a Snell Exhibitioner, to Balliol College, Oxford. He obtained a first class in &quot;literis humanioribus&quot; and took his BA in 1811 (MA 1814). He had been intended for the medical profession, but soon after leaving Oxford he gave up this idea, and in 1813 became a member of the Scottish bar, as a qualified advocate.

Hamilton&#x27;s life continued to be that of a student, while he was gradually forming his philosophic system. Investigation enabled him to make good his claim to represent the ancient family of Hamilton of Preston, and in 1816 he took up its baronetcy, which had been in abeyance since the death of Sir Robert Hamilton of Preston (1650–1701).

==Early time as philosopher==
Two visits to Germany in 1817 and 1820 led to William&#x27;s taking up the study of German and later on that of contemporary German philosophy, which was almost entirely neglected in British universities. In 1820 he was a candidate for the chair of moral philosophy in the University of Edinburgh, which had fallen vacant on the death of Thomas Brown, colleague of Dugald Stewart, and Stewart&#x27;s consequent resignation, however he was defeated on political grounds by John Wilson (1785–1854), the &quot;Christopher North&quot; of &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. In 1821 he was appointed professor of civil history and delivered several courses of lectures on the history of modern Europe and the history of literature. The salary was £100 a year, derived from a local beer tax, and was discontinued after a time. No pupils were compelled to attend, the class dwindled, and Hamilton gave it up when the salary ceased. In January 1827 his mother, to whom he had been devoted, died. In March 1828 he married his cousin, Janet Marshall.

Around this time he moved to live in a recently built townhouse at 11 Manor Place, in Edinburgh&#x27;s west end.

==Publications==
In 1829, his career of authorship began with the appearance of the well-known essay on the &quot;Philosophy of the Unconditioned&quot; (a critique of Victor Cousin&#x27;s &quot;Cours de philosophie&quot;)–the first of a series of articles contributed by him to the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;. He was elected in 1836 to the University of Edinburgh chair of logic and metaphysics, and from this time dates the influence which, during the next 20 years, he exerted over the thought of the younger generation in Scotland. Much about the same time he began the preparation of an annotated edition of Thomas Reid&#x27;s works, intending to annex to it a number of dissertations. However before this design had been carried out, he was struck, in 1844, with paralysis of the right side which seriously crippled his bodily powers, though left his mind unimpaired.

The edition of Reid appeared in 1846, but with only seven of the intended dissertations, one unfinished. At his death he had still not completed the work; notes on the subjects to be discussed were found among his manuscripts. Considerably earlier, he had formed his theory of logic, the leading principles of which were indicated in the prospectus of &quot;an essay on a new analytic of logical forms&quot; prefixed to his edition of Reid. But the elaboration of the scheme in its details and applications continued during the next few years to occupy much of his leisure. Out of this arose a sharp controversy with Augustus De Morgan. The essay did not appear, but the results of the labour gone through are contained in the appendices to his &quot;Lectures on Logic&quot;. Hamilton had also drawn from the works of Wilhelm Esser in his explanation of laws in the language of agency. For instance, he cited Esser&#x27;s definition of universal law, to explain the sense or &quot;quality&quot; of &quot;necessary&quot;.

Hamilton also prepared extensive materials for a publication which he designed on the personal history, influence and opinions of Martin Luther. Here he advanced so far as to have planned and partly carried out the arrangement of the work; but it did not go further, and still remains in manuscript. In 1852–1853 appeared the first and second editions of his &quot;Discussions in Philosophy, Literature and Education&quot;, a reprint, with large additions, of his contributions to the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;. Soon after, his general health began to fail. Assisted by his devoted wife, he persevered in literary labour; and during 1854–1855 he brought out nine volumes of a new edition of Stewart&#x27;s works. The only remaining volume was to have contained a memoir of Stewart, but this he did not live to write. Hamilton was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855. He taught his class for the last time in the winter of 1855–1856. Shortly after the close of the session he was taken ill, and died in Edinburgh.

==Death==
He died on 6 May 1856 and was buried in St John&#x27;s Episcopal Churchyard at the east end of Princes Street in Edinburgh. The stone is not in its original location and is used to edge the enclosure at the east end of the church.

He had married Janet, the daughter of Hubert Marshall, and was succeeded by his son Sir William Stirling-Hamilton, 10th Baronet, a general in the British Army.

==Place in thought==
In 1840, the University of Leyden granted him an honorary Doctor of Divinity (DD), a rarity for persons outside the clergy.

Hamilton&#x27;s positive contribution to the progress of thought is comparatively slight, but he stimulated a spirit of criticism in his pupils by insisting on the great importance of psychology as opposed to the older metaphysical method, and by his recognition of the importance of German philosophy, especially that of Immanuel Kant. By far his most important work was &quot;Philosophy of the Unconditioned,&quot; the development of the principle that for the human finite mind, there can be no knowledge of the Infinite. The basis of his argument is the thesis, &quot;To think is to condition.&quot; Deeply impressed with Kant&#x27;s antithesis between subject and object, the knowing and the known, Hamilton laid down the principle that every object is known only in virtue of its relations to other objects. From this it follows that limitless time, space, power, etc., are inconceivable. The fact, however, that all thought seems to demand the idea of the infinite or absolute provides a sphere for faith, which is thus the specific faculty of theology. It is a weakness characteristic of the human mind that it cannot conceive any phenomenon without a beginning: hence the conception of the causal relation, according to which every phenomenon has its cause in preceding phenomena, and its effect in subsequent phenomena. The causal concept is, therefore, only one of the ordinary necessary forms of the cognitive consciousness limited, as we have seen, by being confined to that which is relative.

As regards the problem of the nature of objectivity, Hamilton simply accepts the evidence of consciousness as to the separate existence of the object: &quot;the root of our nature cannot be a lie.&quot; In virtue of this assumption, Hamilton&#x27;s philosophy becomes a &quot;natural realism.&quot; In fact, his whole position is a strange compound of Kant and Reid. Its chief practical corollary is the denial of philosophy as a method of attaining absolute knowledge and its relegation to the academic sphere of mental training. The transition from philosophy to theology, i.e. to the sphere of faith, is presented by Hamilton under the analogous relation between the mind and the body. As the mind is to the body, so is the unconditioned Absolute or God to the world of the conditioned. Consciousness, itself a conditioned phenomenon, must derive from or depend on some different thing prior to or behind material phenomena. Curiously enough, however, Hamilton does not explain how it comes about that God, who in the terms of the analogy bears to the conditioned mind the relation which the conditioned mind bears to its objects, can be unconditioned. God can be regarded only as related to consciousness, and insofar is, therefore, not absolute or unconditioned. Thus the very principles of Hamilton&#x27;s philosophy are apparently violated in his theological argument.

Hamilton regarded logic as a purely formal science; it seemed to him an unscientific mixing together of heterogeneous elements to treat as parts of the same science the formal and the material conditions of knowledge. He was quite ready to allow that on this view logic cannot be used as a means of discovering or guaranteeing facts, even the most general, and expressly asserted that it has to do, not with the objective validity, but only with the mutual relations, of judgments. He further held that induction and deduction are correlative processes of formal logic, each resting on the necessities of thought and deriving thence its several laws. The only logical laws which he recognised were the three axioms of identity, noncontradiction, and excluded middle, which he regarded as severally phases of one general condition of the possibility of existence and, therefore, of thought. The law of reason and consequent he considered not as different, but merely as expressing metaphysically what these express logically. He added as a postulate—which in his theory was of importance--&quot;that logic be allowed to state explicitly what is thought implicitly.&quot; in logic, Hamilton is known chiefly as the inventor of the doctrine of the &quot;quantification of the predicate,&quot; i.e. that the judgment &quot;All A is B &quot; should really mean &quot;All A is all B,&quot; whereas the ordinary universal proposition should be stated &quot;All A is some B.&quot; This view, which was supported by Stanley Jevons, is fundamentally at fault since it implies that the predicate is thought of in its extension; in point of fact when a judgment is made, e.g. about men, that they are mortal (&quot;All men are mortal&quot;), the intention is to attribute a quality (i.e. the predicate is used in connotation). In other words, we are not considering the question &quot;what kind are men among the various things which must die?&quot; (as is implied in the form &quot;all men are some mortals&quot;) but &quot;what is the fact about men?&quot; We are not stating a mere identity (see further, e.g., H. W. B. Joseph, &quot;Introduction to Logic&quot;, 1906, pp. 198 foll.).

The philosopher to whom above all others Hamilton professed allegiance was Aristotle. His works were the object of his profound and constant study, and supplied in fact the mould in which his whole philosophy was cast. With the commentators on the Aristotelian writings, ancient, medieval and modern, he was also familiar; and the scholastic philosophy he studied with care and appreciation at a time when it had hardly yet begun to attract attention in his country. His wide reading enabled him to trace many a doctrine to the writings of forgotten thinkers; and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to draw forth such from their obscurity, and to give due acknowledgment, even if it chanced to be of the prior possession of a view or argument that he had thought out for himself. Of modern German philosophy he was a diligent, if not always a sympathetic, student. How profoundly his thinking was modified by that of Kant is evident from the tenor of his speculations; nor was this less the case because, on fundamental points, he came to widely different conclusions.

Hamilton was more than a philosopher; his knowledge and interests embraced all subjects related to that of the human mind. He studied anatomy and physiology. He was also well-read in ancient and modern literature, being particularly interested in the 16th and 17th centuries. Among his literary projects were editions of the works of George Buchanan and Julius Caesar Scaliger. His general scholarship found expression in his library, which became part of the library of the University of Glasgow.

He also may have influenced subsequent philosophy as the inspiration for a critique by John Stuart Mill which resulted in perhaps the clearest statements ever of the idea of matter as the permanent possibility of sensation.

==Education==
His chief practical interest was in education, an interest which he manifested alike as a teacher and as a writer, and which had led him long before he was either to study of the subject both theoretical and historical. He thence adopted views as to the ends and methods of education that, when afterwards carried out or advocated by him, met with general recognition; but he also expressed in one of his articles an unfavourable view of the study of mathematics as a mental gymnastic, which excited much opposition, but which he never saw reason to alter. As a teacher, he was zealous and successful, and his writings on university organisation and reform had, at the time of their appearance, a decisive practical effect, and contain much that is of permanent value.

==Last works==
His posthumous works are his &quot;Lectures on Metaphysics and Logic&quot; (1860), 4 vols., edited by H. L. Mansel, Oxford, and John Veitch (&quot;Metaphysics&quot;; &quot;Logic&quot;); and &quot;Additional Notes to Reid&#x27;s Works, from Sir W. Hamilton&#x27;s Manuscripts.&quot;, under the editorship of H. L. Mansel, D.D. (1862). &quot;A Memoir of Sir W. Hamilton&quot;, by Veitch, appeared in 1869.

<doc id="206347" wikidata="Q458256" url="?curid=206347" title="Pharnabazus II">
<text>Pharnabazus II (Old Iranian: &quot;Farnabāzu&quot;, ; ruled 413-374 BC) was a Persian soldier and statesman, and Satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia. He was the son of Pharnaces II of Phrygia and grandson of Pharnabazus I, and great-grandson of Artabazus I. He and his male ancestors, forming the Pharnacid dynasty, had governed the satrapy of Hellespontine Phrygia from its headquarters at Dascylium since 478 BC. He married Apama, daughter of Artaxerxes II of Persia, and their son Artabazus also became a satrap of Phrygia. According to some accounts, his granddaughter Barsine may have become Alexander the Great&#x27;s concubine.

According to research by Theodor Nöldeke, he was descended from Otanes, one of the associates of Darius in the murder of Smerdis.

==Satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia==
===War with Sparta against Athens (c.413-404 BC)===
Athens was the dominant power in the Aegean in the 5th century BC, following the Greeks&#x27; victories over the Achaemenids in the Second Persian invasion of Greece (480-479 BC). Athens, powered by the alliance formed under the Delian League, has even been called the Athenian Empire at that time, and formed the largest threat to the Achaemenid possessions in Asia Minor.

Pharnabazus II was first recorded as satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia in 413 BC, when he received orders from Darius II of Persia to send in the outstanding tribute of the Greek cities on the Ionian coast, tribute he had a hard time to obtain due to Athenian interference. Thucydides described this situation, faced by both satraps Pharnabazus and Tissaphernes:


He, like Tissaphernes of Caria, entered into negotiations with Sparta and began a war with Athens. The conduct of the war was much hindered by the rivalry between the two satraps, of whom Pharnabazus was by far the more energetic and upright. Pharnabazus initially fought with the Spartans against the Athenians during the Peloponnesian war (431–404 BC), even, in one instance, coming to the rescue of the retreating Spartan forces, and riding his horse into the sea to fend off the Athenians while encouraging his regiment.

In 404 BC, Pharnabazus may also have been responsible for the assassination of the Athenian general Alcibiades, who had taken refuge in the Achaemenid Empire. The assassination was probably at the instigation of the Spartans, and specifically Lysander. As Alcibiades was about to set out for the Persian court, his residence was surrounded and set on fire. Seeing no chance of escape he rushed out on his assassins, dagger in hand, and was killed by a shower of arrows.

====Conflict with the Ten Thousand (399 BC)====

After their victory in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), the Spartans became the dominant power in the Aegean, creating a new threat for the Achaemenid Empire. The Spartans then antagonised the Achaemenid king Artaxerxes II by militarily supporting the rival bid of his brother Cyrus the Younger, their ally during the Peloponnesian war, leading to the campaign of the Ten Thousand deep into Achaemenid territory in 401-399 BC. Cyrus the Younger failed, but the relationship between Sparta and the Achaemenid Empire remained adversarial.

Pharnabazus was involved in helping the Bithynians against the plundering raids of the Greek Ten Thousand who were returning from their failed campaign in the centre of the Achaemenid Empire. He was also trying to stop them from entering Hellespontine Phrygia. His cavalry is said to have killed about 500 Greek mercenaries on that occasion, and mounted several raids on the Greek mercenaries. Pharnabazus then arranged with the Spartan admiral Anaxibius for the rest of the Greek mercenaries to be shipped out of the Asian continent to Byzantium.

===War with Athens against Sparta (395–387 BC)===
====Conflict with Spartan King Agesilaos in Asia Minor====

Hellespontine Phrygia was attacked and ravaged by the Spartan king Agesilaos in 396-395 BC, who particularly laid waste to the area around Daskyleion, the capital of Hellenistic Phrygia. Pharnabazus had several military encounters against the invading Spartans on this occasion. Pharnabazus finally met in person with Agesilaos, and Agesilaos agreed to remove himself from Hellespontine Phrygia proper and retreated to the plain of Thebe in the Troad.

In 394, while encamped on the plain of Thebe, Agesilaus was still planning a campaign in the interior of Asia Minor, or even an attack on Artaxerxes II himself, when he was recalled to Greece to fight in the Corinthian War between Sparta and the combined forces of Athens, Thebes, Corinth, Argos and several minor states.

The outbreak of the conflict in Greece had been encouraged by Persian payments to Sparta&#x27;s Greek rivals, and had for effect to remove the Spartan threat in Asia Minor. Pharnabazus sent Timocrates of Rhodes as an envoy to Greece, and tens of thousands of Darics, the main currency in Achaemenid coinage, were used to bribe the Greek states to start a war against Sparta. According to Plutarch, Agesilaus said upon leaving Asia Minor &quot;I have been driven out by 10,000 Persian archers&quot;, a reference to &quot;Archers&quot; (&quot;Toxotai&quot;) the Greek nickname for the Darics from their obverse design, because that much money had been paid to politicians in Athens and Thebes in order to start a war against Sparta.

====Participation to the Corinthian War on the side of Athens (395-393 BC)====
Pharnabazes went on to aid the Athenians against the Spartans in the Corinthian War (394–387 BC). During this period, Pharnabazus is notable for his command of the Achaemenid fleet at the Battle of Cnidus (394 BC) in which the Persians, allied with the former Athenian admiral and then commissioned into Persian service, Conon, annihilated the Spartan fleet, ending Sparta&#x27;s brief status as the dominant Greek naval power.

=====Naval raids in Ionia=====
Pharnabazus followed up his victory at Cnidus by capturing several Spartan-allied cities in Ionia, instigating pro-Athenian and pro-Democracy movements. Abydus and Sestus were the only cities to refuse to expel the Lacedaemonians despite threats from Pharnabazus to make war on them. He attempted to force these into submission by ravaging the surrounding territory, but this proved fruitless, leading him to leave Conon in charge of winning over the cities in the Hellespont.

=====Naval raids on the Peloponnesian coast=====

From 393 BC, Pharnabazus II and Conon sailed with his fleet to the Aegean island of Melos and established a base there. This was the first time in 90 years, since the Greco-Persian Wars, that the Achaemenid fleet was going so far west. The military occupation by these pro-Athenian forces led to several democratic revolutions and new alliances with Athens in the islands.

The fleet proceeded further west to take revenge on the Spartans by invading Lacedaemonian territory, where the Achaemenids laid waste to Pherae and raided along the Messenian coast. Their aim was probably to instigate a revolt of the Messanian helots against Sparta. Eventually they left due to scarce resources and few harbors for the Achaemenid fleet in the area, as well as the looming possibility of Lacedaemonian relief forces being dispatched.

They then raided the coast of Laconia and seized the island of Cythera, where they left a garrison and an Athenian governor to cripple Sparta&#x27;s offensive military capabilities. Cythera in effect became Achaemenid territory. Seizing Cythera also had the effect of cutting the strategic route between Peloponnesia and Egypt and thus avoiding Spartan-Egyptian collusion, and directly threatening Taenarum, the harbour of Sparta. This strategy to threaten Sparta had already been recommended, in vain, by the exiled Spartan Demaratus to Xerxes I in 480 BC.

Pharnabazus II, leaving part of his fleet in Cythera, then went to Corinth, where he gave Sparta&#x27;s rivals funds to further threaten the Lacedaemonians. He also funded the rebuilding of a Corinthian fleet to resist the Spartans.

Xenophon gave a detailed contemporary account of the naval campaign of Pharnabazus in his &quot;Hellenica&quot;: 
=====Rebuilding of the walls of Athens=====

After being convinced by Conon that allowing him to rebuild the Long Walls around Piraeus, the main port of Athens, would be a major blow to the Lacedaemonians, Pharnabazus eagerly gave Conon a fleet of 80 triremes and additional funds to accomplish this task. Pharnabazus dispatched Conon with substantial funds and a large part of the fleet to Attica, where he joined in the rebuilding of the long walls from Athens to Piraeus, a project that had been initiated by Thrasybulus in 394 BC.

According to Xenophon in &quot;Hellenica&quot;: 
With the assistance of the rowers of the fleet, and the workers paid for by the Persian money, the construction was soon completed. Athens quickly took advantage of its possession of walls and a fleet to seize the islands of Scyros, Imbros, and Lemnos, on which it established cleruchies (citizen colonies).

As a reward for his success, Pharnabazus was allowed to marry the king&#x27;s daughter, Apame. He was recalled to the Achaemenid Empire in 393 BC, and replaced by satrap Tiribazus.

===Final settlement with Sparta (386 BC)===

In 386 BC, Artaxerxes II betrayed his Athenian allies and came to an arrangement with Sparta, to the expense of the Greek cities of Asia Minor, which Sparta agreed to concede to the Achaemenids in exchange for Spartan domination in Greece. In the Treaty of Antalcidas he forced his erstwhile allies to come to terms. This treaty restored control of the Greek cities of Ionia and Aeolis on the Anatolian coast to the Persians, while giving Sparta dominance on the Greek mainland.

==Campaign against Egypt (373 BC)==

In 377 BC, Pharnabazus was then reassigned by Artaxerxes II to help command a military expedition into rebellious Egypt, having proven his ability against the Spartans.

After 4 years of preparations in the Levant, Pharnabazes gathered an expeditionary force had 200,000 Persian troops, 300 triremes, 200 galleys, and 12,000 Greeks under Iphicrates. The Achaemenid Empire had also been applying pressure on Athens to recall the Greek general Chabrias, who was in the service of the Egyptians, but in vain. The Egyptian ruler Nectanebo I was thus supported by Athenian General Chabrias and his mercenaries.

===Expedition===
The force landed in Egypt with the Athenian general Iphicrates near Mendes in 373 BC. The expedition force was too slow, giving time to the Egyptians to strengthen defences. Pharnabazus and Iphicrates appeared before Pelusium, but retired without attacking it, Nectanebo I, king of Egypt, having added to its former defences by laying the neighbouring lands under water, and blocking up the navigable channels of the Nile by embankments. (Diodorus Siculus xv. 42; Cornelius Nepos, &quot;Iphicrates&quot; c. 5.) Fortifications on the Pelusiac branch of the Nile ordered by Nectanebo forced the enemy fleet to seek another way to sail up the Nile. Eventually the fleet managed to find its way up the less-defended Mendesian branch. At this point, the mutual distrust that had arisen between Iphicrates and Pharnabazus prevented the enemy from reaching Memphis. Then the annual Nile flood and the Egyptian defenders&#x27; resolve to defend their territory turned what had initially appeared as certain defeat for Nectanebo I and his troops into a complete victory.

After several weeks the Persians, and their Greek mercenaries under Iphicrates, had to re-embark. The expedition against Egypt had failed. It was the end of the career of Pharnabazus, who was now over 70 years old. Pharnabazus was replaced by Datames to lead a second expedition to Egypt, but he failed and then started the &quot;Satraps&#x27; Revolt&quot; against the Great King.
From 368 BC many western satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire started to rebel against Artaxerxes II, in the Great Satraps&#x27; Revolt, so Nectanebo provided financial support to the rebelling satraps and re-established ties with both Sparta and Athens.

===Coinage===
A large number of coins have been found from that period, presumably in order to pay for the troops, particularly for the Greek troops under Iphicrates. The large coinage was minted in Tarsos, Cilicia. The coins use images of the god of war Ares wearing an Attic helmet, or a seated Baal.

==Pharnabazus in Greek literature==

Pharnabazus was one of the best known Satraps among the Greeks, and had many exchanges with them. He is one of the main characters in the &quot;Hellenica&quot; of Xenophon, also appears in his &quot;Anabasis&quot;, and is also very present in the &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot; of Thucydides.

The family of Pharnabazus was closely related to the Greek world. His son Artabazos II married a Greek noblewoman from Rhodes, and lived in exile with his family at the Macedonian court of Philip II for more than ten years. His granddaughter Barsine may have been Alexander the Great&#x27;s concubine and may have had a child by him.

<text>Michael Scott (30 October 1789 – 7 November 1835) was a Scottish author and autobiographer who wrote under the pseudonym Tom Cringle.

==Life and work==
Scott was born in Scotland at Cowlairs, near Glasgow, the son of a Glasgow merchant.

In 1806 he went to Jamaica, first managing some estates, and afterwards joining a business firm in Kingston. The latter post necessitated his making frequent journeys, on the incidents of which he based his best known book, &quot;Tom Cringle&#x27;s Log&quot;.
In 1822 he left Jamaica and settled in Glasgow, where he engaged in business. &quot;Tom Cringle&#x27;s Log&quot; began to appear serially in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1829. Scott’s second story, &quot;The Cruise of the Midge&quot;, was also first published serially in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot; in 1834–1835. The first appearance in book-form of each story was in Paris in 1834. Both stories - &quot;interesting autobiographical portraits of jamaica in the 1820s, written by a perceptive and sympathetic, but transient observer&quot; - were originally published anonymously, and their authorship was not known till after Scott&#x27;s death at Glasgow. Craig Lamont has placed Michael Scott within a &#x27;Glasgow School&#x27; of early nineteenth century Scottish novelists, along with John Galt and Thomas Hamilton.

<doc id="206351" wikidata="Q975655" url="?curid=206351" title="SEB Group">
<text>Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (), abbreviated SEB, is a Swedish bank headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. In Sweden and the Baltic countries, SEB has a full financial service offering. In Denmark, Finland, Norway, Germany, and the United Kingdom, the bank&#x27;s operations are focused on corporate and investment banking services to corporate and institutional clients. The bank was founded in 1972 by the Swedish Wallenberg family, which is still SEB&#x27;s largest shareholder through major investment company Investor AB. SEB is the largest Swedish bank by both market capitalisation and total assets.

The SEB Group traces its origins to the Stockholms Enskilda Bank and Skandinaviska Banken, established in 1856 and 1864 respectively. Both banks played an important role in Scandinavia&#x27;s industrialisation throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, especially in Sweden. After a period of strong growth throughout the twentieth century, Stockholms Enskilda Bank and Skandinaviska Banken merged in 1972 to form the SEB Group.

SEB&#x27;s German and Baltic subsidiaries, being located in eurozone countries, have been designated as Significant Institutions since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, and as a consequence are directly supervised by the European Central Bank.

==History==
In 1972, Stockholms Enskilda Bank (established in 1856 by André Oscar Wallenberg) and Skandinaviska Banken (established in 1864) merged to form SEB. Reasons for the merger included creating a bank better positioned to serve corporate clients and to fend off competition from major international banks. Through its predecessor, Stockholms Enskilda Bank, it claims to be the first bank in the world to employ women.

Stockholms Enskilda Bank was founded and run by the banking-involved Wallenberg family, and served as the lynchpin of their investment throughout most of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Even today, its successor is amongst the most valuable of the Wallenbergs&#x27; various companies, alongside corporations like SKF, Atlas Copco and Ericsson, which it used to have major shareholdings in until Swedish legislation changes in the early twentieth century; these holdings were taken over by Investor AB, still primarily owned by the Wallenberg family today.

Skandinaviska Banken was founded as the Skandinaviska Kreditaktiebolaget, one of the projects of the Scandinavian movement. Thanks to the efforts of André Oscar Wallenberg, Skandinaviska Banken was initially founded and headquartered in Gothenburg rather than Copenhagen, contrary to the wishes of Danish financier Carl Frederik Tietgen; its headquarters was later moved to Stockholm. After its founding, the bank expanded throughout Scandinavia and eventually the rest of the Nordic region until its merger in 1972.

In 1997, SEB acquired the insurance company , and in 1998, the company changed its Swedish-market logo and brand name from SE-Banken to SEB. At the end of that same year, SEB bought its first shares of the three Baltic banks Eesti Ühispank in Estonia, Latvijas Unibanka in Latvia and Vilniaus Bankas in Lithuania. This was the beginning of the bank&#x27;s expansion into the Baltic states, a market in which it still has a large share.

In the early twenty-first century, SEB was initially refused a merger with Swedbank, a decision made by the European Union. In 2007 and 2008, SEB worked with the World Bank to develop the concept of green bonds, a form of bonds designed to accelerate the green transition. Later on, SEB Group would sell its banking operations in Germany and Ukraine as a result of weak profitability, the former to Spain&#x27;s Banco Santander.

SEB Kort AB, a subsidiary of the SEB Group, was the franchisee of Diners Club International in the Nordic Countries until closing said service on 31 May 2019, citing increased competition and regulatory pressure in the Nordic payment card market.

== Markets ==

The SEB Group&#x27;s primary market is its home country, Sweden, where it is also the largest bank in the country, by both market capitalisation and total assets. It is also one of the largest Swedish banks by both employees and customers, with around 17,500 of the former and four and a half million of the latter.

Other major markets of SEB are the Baltic states, where Swedish banks are prominent. SEB is one of the largest banks in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, where Swedbank, another of Sweden&#x27;s big four banks, is amongst its primary rivals. The SEB Group also has operations in most other Nordic countries, as well as larger foreign markets like Germany and the United Kingdom.

== Business ==
In Sweden and the Baltic countries, SEB is a universal bank, offering financial advice and a wide range of financial services to all customer segments. In Denmark, Finland, Norway, Germany and the United Kingdom the bank&#x27;s operations have a strong focus on a full-service offering to corporate and institutional clients. SEB also has a presence in more than 20 locations worldwide including New York, São Paulo, London, Luxembourg, Geneva, Warsaw, Kyiv, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore and New Delhi.

SEB serves 2,000 large corporations and 1,100 financial institutions, 400,000 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and some 4 million private individuals.

The company is operating through six business divisions; Large Corporates &amp; Financial Institutions, Corporate &amp; Private Customers, Private Wealth Management &amp; Family Office, Baltic, Life and Asset Management.

The SEB Group is still owned and headed by its founding family, the Wallenbergs, with Marcus Wallenberg serving as chairman of the company&#x27;s board of directors. The Wallenbergs&#x27; investments in SEB primarily come through the family-owned investment company, Investor AB.

== Sustainability ==
SEB signed the UN Global Compact 2004 and has since then committed to several global initiatives and international codes of conduct. Among them are the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the UNEP FI Principles for Responsible Banking, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, the Principles for Responsible Investments and Net Zero Asset Managers initiative.

SEB has developed ten sector policies for agriculture, arms &amp; defence, forestry, fossil fuel, gambling, mining &amp; metals, renewable energy, shipping, tobacco and transportation. In addition, the company has thematic policies on environment (including climate change, freshwater and biodiversity) and social and human rights. In addition to having developed the green bond concept together with the World Bank in 2007 and 2008, SEB was in 2014 also part of the creation of Green Bond Principles. This is partially in line with modern Swedish ideas of focus on reducing climate change.

In 2009 SEB published its first sustainability report in line with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines.  Since 2017 the sustainability report is integrated in the Annual Report and is aligned with reporting frameworks such as Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, TCFD and the Principles for Responsible Banking. Unlike many banks, SEB is rarely in controversy in relation to its climate policy, in contrast to larger financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse.

<doc id="206353" wikidata="Q232062" url="?curid=206353" title="Oliver E. Williamson">
<text>Oliver Eaton Williamson (September 27, 1932 – May 21, 2020) was an American economist, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and recipient of the 2009 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, which he shared with Elinor Ostrom.

His contributions to transaction cost economics and the theory of the firm have been influential in the social sciences, law and economics. Williamson described his work as &quot;a blend of soft social science and abstract economic theory&quot;.

==Life and career==
Oliver &quot;Olly&quot; Williamson was born in Superior, Wisconsin, on 27 September 1932. He was the son of Sara Lucille (Dunn) and Scott Williamson, both of whom were high school teachers. As a child, Williamson attended Central High School in Superior. 

Williamson’s dual enrollment between Ripon College and MIT earned him his bachelor’s degree in management from the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1955. During his time in his undergraduate academic career, his studies in engineering sparked his initial interest in transaction costs. After graduating, he worked as a project engineer for General Electric, as well as the Central Intelligence Agency. 

Williamson received an MBA from Stanford University in 1960, and his PhD from Carnegie Mellon University, formerly Carnegie Tech, in 1963. His dissertation was titled ‘The Economics of Discretionary Behaviour: Managerial Objectives in a Theory of the Firm’. A student of Ronald Coase, Herbert A. Simon and Richard Cyert, he specialized in transaction cost economics.

From 1963 to 1965 he was an Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of California, Berkeley. From 1965 to 1983 he was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and from 1983 to 1988, a Gordon B. Tweedy Professor of Economics of Law and Organization at Yale University. While at Yale, Williamson was a founder of &quot;The Journal of Law, Economics, &amp; Organization&quot;. He held professorships in business administration, economics, and law at the University of California, Berkeley since 1988 and was the Edgar F. Kaiser Professor Emeritus at the Haas School of Business. As a Fulbright Distinguished Chair, in 1999 he taught Economics at the University of Siena.

Found to be one of the most cited authors in the social sciences, in 2009, he was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for &quot;his analysis of economic governance, especially the boundaries of the firm&quot;, sharing it with Elinor Ostrom. Williamson died on May 21, 2020, in Berkeley, California.

==Theory==
By drawing attention at a high theoretical level to equivalences and differences between market and non-market decision-making, management and service provision, Williamson was influential in the 1980s and 1990s debates on the boundaries between the public and private sectors.

His focus on the costs of transactions led Williamson to distinguish between repeated case-by-case bargaining on the one hand and relationship-specific contracts on the other. For example, the repeated purchasing of coal from a spot market to meet the daily or weekly needs of an electric utility would represent case-by-case bargaining. But over time, the utility is likely to form ongoing relationships with a specific supplier, and the economics of the relationship-specific dealings will be importantly different, he argued.

Other economists have tested Williamson&#x27;s transaction-cost theories in empirical contexts. One important example is a paper by Paul L. Joskow, &quot;Contract Duration and Relationship-Specific Investments: Empirical Evidence from Coal Markets&quot;, in &quot;American Economic Review&quot;, March 1987. The incomplete contracts approach to the theory of the firm and corporate finance is partly based on the work of Williamson and Coase.

Williamson was credited with the development of the term &quot;information impactedness&quot;, which applies in situations of unequal access to information. As he explained in &quot;Markets and Hierarchies&quot;, it exists &quot;mainly because of uncertainty and opportunism, though bounded rationality is involved as well. It exists when true underlying circumstances relevant to the transaction, or related set of transactions, are known to one or more parties but cannot be costlessly discerned by or displayed for others&quot;. Thus, Williamson is to be counted among those who have taken issue with the view that the firm is another type of market, characterized by a nexus of contracts. In his own words: &quot;But to regard the corporation only as a nexus of contracts misses much of what is truly distinctive about this mode of governance&quot;.

==Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences==

In 2009, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences cited Williamson and Elinor Ostrom to share the 10-million Swedish kronor (£910,000; $1.44 million) prize &quot;for his analysis of economic governance, especially the boundaries of the firm&quot;. Williamson, in the BBC&#x27;s paraphrase of the academy&#x27;s reasoning, &quot;developed a theory where business firms served as structures for conflict resolution&quot;.
==Personal life==
He met his wife Dolores Celini in 1957, while they both lived in Washington, D.C. They had five children.

<text>John Veitch (24 October 1829 – 3 September 1894), Scottish philosopher, poet and historian. He was born in Peebles, the only son of Peninsular War veteran James Veitch and his wife Nancy Ritchie, a woman steeped in the folk traditions of the Borders. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh.

He was assistant lecturer successively to Sir William Hamilton and Alexander Campbell Fraser (1856–60). In 1860 he was appointed to the chair of logic, metaphysics and rhetoric at the University of St Andrews, and in 1864 to the corresponding chair at the University of Glasgow.

In St. Andrews, he lived at 8 Playfair Terrace.

In Glasgow, he lectured to working men and women and between 1877 and 1883 put on courses for the Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of Women. He founded the Scottish Mountaineering Club in 1892. He deplored the damaging environmental impacts of industrialisation and campaigned to save old buildings.

In philosophy an intuitionist, he was dismissive of idealist arguments. He is remembered chiefly for his work on the literature and antiquities of the Scottish Borders. See &quot;Memoir&quot; by his niece, Mary RL Bryce (1896).

<text>The Baháʼí calendar used in the Baháʼí Faith is a solar calendar consisting of nineteen months and four or five intercalary days, with new year at the moment of Northern spring equinox. Each month is named after a virtue (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Perfection, Mercy), as are the days of the week. The first year is dated from 1844 CE, the year in which the Báb began teaching.

Years on the calendar are annotated with the date notation of BE (Baháʼí Era). The Baháʼí year 182 BE on 20 March 2025.

==History==
The Baháʼí calendar started from the original Badíʿ calendar, created by the Báb in the &quot;Kitabu&#x27;l-Asmáʼ&quot; and the &quot;Persian Bayán&quot; (5:3) in the 1840s. An early version of the calendar began to be implemented during his time. It used a scheme of nineteen months of nineteen days, with the product of 361 days, plus intercalary days to make the calendar a solar calendar. The first day of the early implementation of the calendar year was Nowruz, while the intercalary days were assigned differently than the later Baháʼí implementation. The calendar contains many symbolic meanings and allusions including connections to prophecies of the Báb about the next Manifestation of God termed He whom God shall make manifest.

Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, who claimed to be the one prophesied by the Báb, confirmed and adopted this calendar. Around 1870, he instructed Nabíl-i-Aʻzam, the author of &quot;The Dawn-Breakers&quot;, to write an overview of the Badíʿ calendar. In the &quot;Kitáb-i-Aqdas&quot; (1873) Baháʼu&#x27;lláh made Naw-Rúz the first day of the year, and also clarified the position of the Intercalary days to immediately precede the last month. Baháʼu&#x27;lláh set Naw-Rúz to the day on which the sun passes into the constellation Aries. Baháʼís interpret this formula as a specification of the vernal equinox, though where that should be determined was not defined.

The calendar was first implemented in the West in 1907.

The Baháʼí scriptures left some issues regarding the implementation of the Badíʿ calendar to be resolved by the Universal House of Justice before the calendar can be observed uniformly worldwide.

On 10 July 2014 the Universal House of Justice announced provisions that will enable the common implementation of the Badíʿ calendar worldwide, beginning at sunset 20 March 2015, coinciding with the completion of the ninth cycle of the calendar (see below). Before that time, the Baháʼí calendar was synchronized to the Gregorian calendar by starting the year at sunset on March 20, regardless of when the vernal equinox technically occurs, meaning that the extra day of a leap year occurred simultaneously in both calendars. The intercalary days always stretched from 26 February to 1 March, automatically including the Gregorian leap day so that there were four intercalary days in a regular year, and five in a Gregorian leap year. The Universal House of Justice selected Tehran, the birthplace of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, as the location at which the time and date of the vernal equinox is to be determined according to astronomical tables from reliable sources. These changes, which &quot;unlocked&quot; the Badíʿ calendar from the Gregorian calendar, came into effect at the start of year 172 BE.

== Significance ==
As the name Badíʿ (&quot;wondrous&quot; or &quot;unique&quot;) suggests, the Baháʼí calendar is indeed a unique institution in the history of human culture. Sociologist Eviatar Zerubavel notes that the nineteen-day cycle creates a distinctive rhythm which enhances group solidarity. (Zerubavel argues that the nineteen-day cycle is more properly defined as a week, rather than a month, because it bears &quot;no connection whatsoever&quot; to the lunar cycle.) Furthermore, by finding the closest approximation of the square root of the annual cycle, Baháʼís &quot;have managed to establish the most symmetrical relationship possible between the week and the year, which no one else throughout history has ever managed to accomplish.&quot;

==Years==
Years in the Baháʼí calendar are counted from Thursday 21 March 1844, the beginning of the Baháʼí Era or Badíʿ Era (abbreviated &quot;BE&quot; or &quot;B.E.&quot;). Year 1 BE thus began at sundown 20 March 1844.

The length of each year is strictly defined as the number of days between the opening and closing days of the year, with the number of intercalary days adjusted as needed. The year ends on the day before the following vernal equinox.

===Vernal Equinox===

The first day of each year (Naw-Rúz) is the day (from sunset to sunset) in Tehran containing the moment of the vernal equinox. This is determined in advance by astronomical computations from reliable sources.

Since the Gregorian calendar is not tied to the equinox, the Gregorian calendar shifts around by a day or two each year, as shown in the following table.

==Months==
The Baháʼí calendar is composed of nineteen months, each with nineteen days. The intercalary days, known as Ayyám-i-Há, occur between the eighteenth and nineteenth months.

The names of the months were adopted by the Báb from the Du&#x27;ay-i-Sahar, a Ramadan dawn prayer by Imam Muhammad al-Baqir, the fifth Imam of Twelver Shiʻah Islam. These month names are considered to be referring to attributes of God.

In the &quot;Persian Bayan&quot; the Báb divides the months into four groups known as &quot;fire&quot;, &quot;air&quot;, &quot;water&quot; and &quot;earth&quot; – which are three, four, six and six months long respectively. Robin Mirshahi suggests a possible link with four realms described in Baháʼí cosmology. Ismael Velasco relates this to the &quot;arc of ascent&quot;.

In the following table, the Gregorian date indicates the first full day of the month when Naw-Rúz coincides with 21 March. The month begins at sunset of the day previous to the one listed.

===Ayyám-i-Há===

The introduction of intercalation marked an important break from Islam, as under the Islamic calendar the practice of intercalation had been specifically prohibited in the Qurʼan.

The number of the intercalary days is determined in advance to ensure that the year ends on the day before the next vernal equinox. This results in 4 or 5 intercalary days being added. These days are inserted between the 18th and 19th months, falling around the end of February in the Gregorian calendar. The number of days added is unrelated to the timing of the Gregorian leap year.

===Significance in the Baháʼí Faith===
The annual Nineteen Day Fast is held during the final month of ʻAláʼ. The month of fasting is followed by Naw-Rúz, the new year.

The monthly Nineteen Day Feast is celebrated on the first day of each month, preferably starting any time between the sunset on the eve of the day to the sunset ending the day.

==Days in a Month==
The nineteen days in a month have the same names as the months of the year (above), so, for example, the 9th day of each month is Asmá, or &quot;Names&quot;.

==Weekdays==
The Baháʼí week starts on Saturday, and ends on Friday. As in Judaism and Islam, days begin at sunset and end at sunset of the following solar day. Baháʼí writings indicate that Friday is to be kept as a day of rest. The practice of keeping Friday as a day of rest is currently not observed in all countries; for example, in the UK, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʼís confirmed it does not currently keep this practice.

==Cycles==
Also existing in the Baháʼí calendar system is a nineteen-year cycle called Váḥid and a 361 year (19×19) supercycle called Kull-i-S͟hayʼ (literally, &quot;All Things&quot;). The expression Kull-i-Shayʼ was used frequently by the Báb. It has its origins in Sufism and the significance of the numbers 19 and 361 were possibly already associated by Ibn Arabi (1165–1240).

Each of the nineteen years in a Vahid has been given a name as shown in the table below. The tenth Váḥid of the 1st Kull-i-S͟hayʼ started on 21 March 2015, and the eleventh Váḥid will begin in 2034.

The current Baháʼí year, year 181 BE (20 March 2024 – 20 March 2025), is the year Ḥubb of the tenth Váḥid of the first Kull-i-S͟hayʼ. The second Kull-i-S͟hayʼ will begin in 2205.

The concept of a nineteen-year cycle has existed in some form since the fourth century BCE. The Metonic cycle represents an invented measure that approximately correlates solar and lunar markings of time and which appears in several calendar systems.

<text>Alexander Campbell Fraser (3 September 1819 – 2 December 1914) was a Scottish theologian and philosopher.

==Life==

He was born in the manse at Ardchattan, Argyll, the son of the parish minister, Rev Hugh Fraser, and his wife, Maria Helen Campbell. He was the eldest of twelve children.

Due to ill-health he was educated by his mother then sent to Glasgow aged 14 to study divinity at the University of Glasgow under Prof James Mylne. However, he did not find Glasgow to his liking as a city and stayed there only one year. He completed his studies at University of Edinburgh, graduating at Divinity Hall in 1843. This was a tumultuous year in the Scottish church, and Fraser decided to join the Free Church following the Disruption. He was ordained in 1844 and became minister of the small parish of Cramond on the Firth of Forth just on the outer edge of Edinburgh. Remaining in Edinburgh he succeeded Sir William Hamilton as professor of logic at New College in 1846 and remained in this role until 1856.

He edited the &quot;North British Review&quot; from 1850 to 1857, and in 1856, having previously been a Free Church of Scotland minister, he succeeded Sir William Hamilton as professor of Logic and Metaphysics at Edinburgh University. In 1859 he became Dean of the Faculty of Arts at the university and retained this role for 30 years.

In 1831 Sir William Hamilton was appointed to the chair of logic and metaphysics, and Fraser became his pupil. He himself said &quot;I owe more to Hamilton than to any other influence.&quot; It was about this time also that he began his study of Berkeley and Coleridge, and deserted his early phenomenalism for the conception of a spiritual will as the universal cause. In the &quot;Biographia&quot; this &quot;Theistic faith&quot; appears in its full development (see the concluding chapter), and is especially important as perhaps the nearest approach to Kantian ethics made by original English philosophy. Apart from the philosophical interest of the &quot;Biographia&quot;, the work contains valuable pictures of the Lam of Lorne and Argyllshire society in the early 19th century, of university life in Glasgow and Edinburgh, and a history of the &quot;North British Review&quot;.

In 1858 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Philip Kelland.

In 1897 he was presented to Queen Victoria during her diamond jubilee tour of Scotland.

In 1904 he published an autobiography entitled &quot;Biographia philosophica&quot;, in which he sketched the progress of his intellectual development. From this work and from his Gifford Lectures (1894–96) we learn objectively what had previously been inferred from his critical work. After a childhood spent in an austerity which stigmatised as unholy even the novels of Sir Walter Scott, he began his college career at the age of fourteen at a time when Christopher North and Dr Ritchie were lecturing on Moral Philosophy and Logic. His first philosophical advance was stimulated by Thomas Brown&#x27;s &quot;Cause and Effect&quot;, which introduced him to the problems which were to occupy his thought. From this point he embraced the scepticism of David Hume.

Fraser was a personal idealist.

He received an honorary Doctorate of Letters (D.Litt.) from the University of Dublin in June 1902.

Until his wife&#x27;s death in 1907, he lived at a house in Hawthornden near Lasswade. Thereafter he lived at 34 Melville Street in Edinburgh&#x27;s fashionable West End.

Fraser is buried in the small northern cemetery at Lasswade with his wife, Jemima Gordon (1819–1907), against the north boundary.

==Family==

In 1850 at St Cuthberts in Edinburgh he married Jemima Gordon Dyce (1819-1907) daughter of William Dyce.

His eldest son Hugh John Edward Fraser (1851–1908) was an advocate and died without issue. He is buried in Dean Cemetery. His daughter Maria Helen (1859–1947) married Robert Forman died 1914 without issue. His youngest son The Rev Alexander Campbell Fraser (1860–1941) married Mary Matthew (1863–1946). One son Alexander Campbell Fraser (1889–1968)

His great grandson, Patrick Alexander Campbell Fraser (b 1933), married Kalitza Spurway, daughter of Marcus Spurway in 1961.

==Artistic Recognition==

Fraser&#x27;s portrait, by George Reid PRSA, hangs in the Old College in Edinburgh University.

==Selected publications==

Fraser devoted himself to the study of British and Irish philosophers, especially George Berkeley, and published:
* &quot;Collected Edition of the Works of Bishop Berkeley with Annotations, etc.&quot; (1871; enlarged 1901). Charles Peirce praised this edition for both including some writing not in other editions, and offering a more carefully edited texts. While Peirce praised the book for the provision of useful introductions, he opined that the explanatory notes disfigured every page in an unnecessary and useless manner.
* &quot;Biography of Berkeley&quot; (1881),
* &quot;Annotated Edition of Locke&#x27;s Essay&quot; (1894),
* &quot;Philosophy of Theism&quot; (1896)
* A biography of &quot;Thomas Reid&quot; (1898) in the &quot;Famous Scots Series&quot;. He contributed the article on John Locke to the Encyclopædia Britannica.

<doc id="206358" wikidata="Q192891" url="?curid=206358" title="Holism">
<text>Holism is the interdisciplinary idea that systems possess properties as wholes apart from the properties of their component parts.
The aphorism &quot;The whole is greater than the sum of its parts&quot;, typically attributed to Aristotle, is often given as a summary of this proposal. The concept of holism can inform the methodology for a broad array of scientific fields and lifestyle practices. When applications of holism are said to reveal properties of a whole system beyond those of its parts, these qualities are referred to as emergent properties of that system. Holism in all contexts is often placed in opposition to reductionism, a dominant notion in the philosophy of science that systems containing parts contain no unique properties beyond those parts. Proponents of holism consider the search for emergent properties within systems to be demonstrative of their perspective.

==Background==

The term &quot;holism&quot; was coined by Jan Smuts (1870–1950) in his 1926 book &quot;Holism and Evolution&quot;. While he never assigned a consistent meaning to the word, Smuts used holism to represent at least three features of reality. First, holism claims that every scientifically measurable thing, either physical or psychological, does possess a nature as a whole beyond its parts. His examples include atoms, cells, or an individual&#x27;s personality. Smuts discussed this sense of holism in his claim that an individual&#x27;s body and mind are not completely separated but instead connect and represent the holistic idea of a person. In his second sense, Smuts referred to holism as the cause of evolution. He argued that evolution is neither an accident nor is it brought about by the actions of some transcendent force, such as a God. Smuts criticized writers who emphasized Darwinian concepts of natural selection and genetic variation to support an accidental view of natural processes within the universe. Smuts perceived evolution as the process of nature correcting itself creatively and intentionally. In this way, holism is described as the tendency of a whole system to creatively respond to environmental stressors, a process in which parts naturally work together to bring the whole into more advanced states. Smuts used Pavlovian studies to argue that the inheritance of behavioral changes supports his idea of creative evolution as opposed to purely accidental development in nature.
Smuts believed that this creative process was intrinsic within all physical systems of parts and ruled out indirect, transcendent forces. Finally, Smuts used holism to explain the concrete (nontranscendent) nature of the universe in general. In his words, holism is &quot;the ultimate synthetic, ordering, organizing, regulative activity in the universe which accounts for all the structural groupings and syntheses in it.&quot; Smuts argued that a holistic view of the universe explains its processes and their evolution more effectively than a reductive view.

Professional philosophers of science and linguistics did not consider &quot;Holism and Evolution&quot; seriously upon its initial publication in 1926 and the work has received criticism for a lack of theoretical coherence. Some biological scientists, however, did offer favorable assessments shortly after its first print. Over time, the meaning of the word holism became most closely associated with Smuts&#x27; first conception of the term, yet without any metaphysical commitments to monism, dualism, or similar concepts which can be inferred from his work.

==Scientific applications==
===Physics===
====Nonseparability====
The advent of holism in the 20th century coincided with the gradual development of quantum mechanics. 
Holism in physics is the nonseparability of physical systems from their parts, especially quantum phenomena. Classical physics cannot be regarded as holistic, as the behavior of individual parts represents the whole. However, the state of a system in quantum theory resists a certain kind of reductive analysis. For example, two spatially separated quantum systems are described as &quot;entangled,&quot; or nonseparable from each other, when a meaningful analysis of one system is indistinguishable from that of the other. There are different conceptions of nonseparability in physics and its exploration is considered to broadly present insight into the ontological problem.

====Variants====
In one sense, holism for physics is a perspective about the best way to understand the nature of a physical system. In this sense, holism is the methodological claim that systems are accurately understood according to their properties as a whole. A methodological reductionist in physics might seek to explain, for example, the behavior of a liquid by examining its component molecules, atoms, ions or electrons. A methodological holist, on the other hand, believes there is something misguided about this approach; one proponent, a condensed matter physicist, puts it: “the most important advances in this area come about by the emergence of qualitatively new concepts at the intermediate or macroscopic levels—concepts which, one hopes, will be compatible with one&#x27;s information about the microscopic constituents, but which are in no sense logically dependent on it.” This perspective is considered a conventional attitude among contemporary physicists.
In another sense, holism is a metaphysical claim that the nature of a system is not determined by the properties of its component parts. There are three varieties of this sense of physical holism.
*Ontological holism: some systems are not merely composed of their physical parts
*Property holism: some systems have properties independent of their physical parts
*Nomological holism: some systems follow physical laws beyond the laws followed by their physical parts

The metaphysical claim does not assert that physical systems involve abstract properties beyond the composition of its physical parts, but that there are concrete properties aside from those of its basic physical parts. Theoretical physicist David Bohm (1917-1992) supports this view head-on. Bohm believed that a complete description of the universe would have to go beyond a simple list of all its particles and their positions, there would also have to be a physical quantum field associated with the properties of those particles guiding their trajectories. Bohm&#x27;s ontological holism concerning the nature of whole physical systems was literal. But Niels Bohr (1885-1962), on the other hand, held ontological holism from an epistemological angle, rather than a literal one. Bohr saw an observational apparatus to be a part of a system under observation, besides the basic physical parts themselves. His theory agrees with Bohm that whole systems were not merely composed of their parts and it identifies properties such as position and momentum as those of whole systems beyond those of its components. But Bohr states that these holistic properties are only meaningful in experimental contexts when physical systems are under observation and that these systems, when not under observation, cannot be said to have meaningful properties, even if these properties took place outside our observation. While Bohr claims these holistic properties exist only insofar as they can be observed, Bohm took his ontological holism one step further by claiming these properties must exist regardless.

===Linguistics===
Semantic holism suggests that the meaning of individual words depends on the meaning of other words, forming a large web of interconnections. In general, meaning holism states that the properties which determine the meaning of a word are connected such that if the meaning of one word changes, the meaning of every other word in the web changes as well. The set of words that alter in meaning due to a change in the meaning of some other is not necessarily specified in meaning holism, but typically such a change is taken straightforwardly to affect the meaning of every word in the language.

In scientific disciplines, reductionism is the opposing viewpoint to holism. But in the context of linguistics or the philosophy of language, reductionism is typically referred to as atomism. Specifically, atomism states that each word&#x27;s meaning is independent and so there are no emergent properties within a language. Additionally, there is meaning molecularism which states that a change in one word alters the meaning of only a relatively small set of other words.

The linguistic perspective of meaning holism is traced back to Quine but was subsequently formalized by analytic philosophers Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, and Ernest Lepore.
While this holistic approach attempts to resolve a classical problem for the philosophy of language concerning how words convey meaning, there is debate over its validity mostly from two angles of criticism: opposition to compositionality and, especially, instability of meaning. The first claims that meaning holism conflicts with the compositionality of language. Meaning in some languages is compositional in that meaning comes from the structure of an expression&#x27;s parts. Meaning holism suggests that the meaning of words plays an inferential role in the meaning of other words: &quot;pet fish&quot; might &quot;imply&quot; a meaning of &quot;less than 3 ounces.&quot; Since holistic views of meaning assume meaning depends on which words are used and how those words confer meaning onto other words, rather than how they are structured, meaning holism stands in conflict with compositionalism and leaves statements with potentially ambiguous meanings. The second criticism claims that meaning holism makes meaning in language unstable. If some words must be used to infer the meaning of other words, then in order to communicate a message, the sender and the receiver must share an identical set of inferential assumptions or beliefs. If these beliefs were different, meaning may be lost.

Many types of communication would be directly affected by the principles of meaning holism such as informative communication, language learning, and communication about psychological states. Nevertheless, some meaning holists maintain that the instability of meaning holism is an acceptable feature from several different angles. In one example, &quot;contextual&quot; holists make this point simply by suggesting we often do not actually share identical inferential assumptions but instead rely on context to counter differences of inference and support communication.

===Biology===

Scientific applications of holism within biology are referred to as systems biology. The opposing analytical approach of systems biology is biological organization which models biological systems and structures only in terms of their component parts. &quot;The reductionist approach has successfully identified most of the components and many of the interactions but, unfortunately, offers no convincing concepts or methods to understand how system properties emerge...the pluralism of causes and effects in biological networks is better addressed by observing, through quantitative measures, multiple components simultaneously and by rigorous data integration with mathematical models.&quot;
The objective in systems biology is to advance models of the interactions in a system. Holistic approaches to modelling have involved cellular modelling strategies, genomic interaction analysis, and phenotype prediction.

====Systems medicine====

Systems medicine is a practical approach to systems biology and accepts its holistic assumptions. Systems medicine takes the systems of the human body as made up of a complete whole and uses this as a starting point in its research and, ultimately, treatment.

==Lifestyle applications==
The term holism is also sometimes used in the context of various lifestyle practices, such as dieting, education, and healthcare, to refer to ways of life that either supplement or replace conventional practices. In these contexts, holism is not necessarily a rigorous or well-defined methodology for obtaining a particular lifestyle outcome. It is sometimes simply an adjective to describe practices which account for factors that standard forms of these practices may discount, especially in the context of alternative medicine.

<text>Scania AB ( , ), stylised SCANIA in its products, is a major Swedish manufacturer headquartered in Södertälje, focusing on commercial vehicles—specifically heavy lorries, trucks and buses. It also manufactures diesel engines for heavy vehicles as well as marine and general industrial applications.

Scania was formed in 1911 through the merger of Södertälje-based Vabis and Malmö-based Maskinfabriks-aktiebolaget Scania. Since 1912, the company headquarters have been based in Södertälje after the merger. Today, Scania has production facilities in Sweden, France, the Netherlands, Thailand, China, India, Argentina, Brazil, Poland and Finland. In addition, there are assembly plants in ten countries in Africa, Asia and Europe. Scania&#x27;s sales and service organisation and finance companies are worldwide. In 2022, the company employed approximately 56,927 people around the world.

Scania was listed on the NASDAQ OMX Stockholm stock exchange from 1996 to 2014. The company is a subsidiary of Traton, part of the Volkswagen Group.

Scania&#x27;s logo shows a griffin, from the coat of arms of the province of Scania ().

==History==


===Vabis and Maskinfabriks-aktiebolaget Scania===

AB Scania-Vabis was established in 1911 as the result of a merger between Södertälje-based Vabis and Malmö-based Maskinfabriks-aktiebolaget Scania. Vagnfabriks Aktiebolaget i Södertelge (Vabis) was established as a railway car manufacturer in 1891, while Maskinfabriks-aktiebolaget Scania was established as a bicycle manufacturer in 1900. Both companies had tried their luck at building automobiles, trucks and engines, but with varied success. In 1910, Maskinfabriks-aktiebolaget Scania had succeeded in constructing reliable vehicles, while Vabis was at the brink of closing down. An offer from Per Alfred Nordeman, managing director of Maskinfabriks-aktiebolaget Scania, to steel manufacturer Surahammars Bruk, owner of Vabis, led to an agreement in November 1910, and in 1911 the merger was a reality.
Development and production of engines and light vehicles were set to Södertälje, while trucks were manufactured in Malmö. The company&#x27;s logo was redesigned from Maskinfabriks-aktiebolaget Scania&#x27;s original logo with the head of a griffin, the coat of arms of the Swedish region Scania (Skåne), centered on a three-spoke bicycle chainset. Initially the headquarters were located in Malmö, but in 1912 they were moved to Södertälje.

===First World War and 1920s===
Because there were many inexpensive, imported cars in Sweden at the time, Scania-Vabis decided to build high-class, luxury cars, for instance the type III limousine from 1920 that had a top hat holder in the roof. Prince Carl of Sweden owned a 1913 Scania-Vabis 3S, a type which was fitted with in-car buttons so the passenger could communicate with the driver. Scania-Vabis also built two-seat sports cars (or &quot;sportautomobil&quot;).

For the next few years the company&#x27;s profits stagnated, with around a third of their orders coming from abroad. The outbreak of the First World War, however, changed the company, with almost all output being diverted to the Swedish Army. By 1916, Scania-Vabis was making enough profit to invest in redeveloping both of their production facilities.

Following the war, in 1919, Scania decided to focus completely on building trucks, abandoning other outputs including cars and buses. However, they were hurt by the swamping of the market with decommissioned military vehicles from the war, and by 1921 the company was bankrupt.

After some economic difficulties in 1921, new capital came from Stockholms Enskilda Bank owned by the Wallenberg family, and Scania-Vabis became a solid and technically, high standing, company.

;Denmark
Towards the end of 1913, the company established a subsidiary in Denmark. The following year the first Danish-built car, a four-seater Phaeton, was built at the company&#x27;s Frederiksberg factory in Copenhagen. In 1914, the factory produced Denmark&#x27;s first Scania-Vabis truck, and following this developed a V8 engine, one of the first in the world. In 1921, having sold around 175 trucks, and 75 cars, the Danish operation was closed down.

;Norway
In 1917 an agreement was established with the newly formed Norwegian company Norsk Automobilfabrik A/S about production under license of Scania-Vabis cars and lorries. Production began in 1919, but was ended in 1921 after production of only 77 lorries, mostly built from Swedish produced parts.

===1930s and 1940s===
During the Second World War, Scania produced a variety of military vehicles for the Swedish Army, including Stridsvagn m/41 light tanks produced under licence.

===1950s and 1960s===
During the 1950s, the company expanded its operations into new customer segments, becoming agents for the Willys Jeep and the Volkswagen Beetle, the latter being very profitable for Scania-Vabis. It also started to become a genuine competitor to Volvo with their new L71 Regent truck which was introduced in 1954.

During this period, Scania-Vabis expanded its dealer network and country-wide specialist workshop facilities. By the end of the 1950s, their market-share in Sweden was between 40 and 50%, and was achieving 70% in the heaviest truck sector – helped by the entrepreneurial efforts of their dealers into the haulier market.

Probably their largest impact was in export markets. Before 1950, exports accounted for only 10 percent of production output, but a decade later, exports were at 50% of output. Beers in the Netherlands became a very important partner. Beers became official importers for Scania-Vabis in the Netherlands, and established a dealer network, along with training programmes for both mechanics and drivers. Beers also offered free twice-yearly overhauls of their customers vehicles, and offered a mobile service throughout the Netherlands with their custom-equipped service trucks. Due to Beers concerted efforts, Scania-Vabis market share in the country remained at a consistent 20% throughout this period. Scania-Vabis were to adopt the business model of Beers in their own overseas sales operations.

The 1960s saw Scania-Vabis expanding its production operations into overseas locations. Until now, all Scania-Vabis production had been carried out solely at Södertälje, but the 1960s saw the need to expand production overseas. Brazil was becoming a notable market for heavy trucks, and was also dependent on inter-urban buses, with particular requirement for Brazil&#x27;s mountainous roads which became nigh-on impassable at times. On 2 July 1957, Brazilian subsidiary &quot;Scania-Vabis do Brasil S.A.&quot; (today known as &quot;Scania Latin America Ltda.&quot;) was established and started assembling some vehicles themselves in 1958. On 29 May 1959, a new engine plant was inaugurated in the Ipiranga district of São Paulo, and from June 1960, Scania-Vabis do Brasil assembled all vehicles themselves. Scania-Vabis vehicles had already been assembled in Brazil by a local company called Vemag (&quot;Veículos e Máquinas Agrícolas S.A.&quot;) for several years. Scania-Vabis established its first full manufacturing plant outside Södertälje, by building a new facility in São Bernardo do Campo near São Paulo, which was opened on 8 December 1962, and this was to set the standard for Scania-Vabis international operations.

Closer to home, the recently formed European Economic Community (EEC) offered further opportunities. Based on their now strong presence in the Dutch markets, Scania-Vabis constructed a new plant in Zwolle, which was completed in 1964. This new Dutch facility provided Scania-Vabis with a stepping stone into the other five EEC countries, particularly the German and French markets.

In 1966, Scania-Vabis acquired ownership of a then valuable supplier – Be-Ge Karosserifabrik, who were based in Oskarshamn. Be-Ge had been making truck cabs since 1946, and had been supplying cabs not only to Scania-Vabis, but also to their Swedish competitors Volvo. It was normal practice for truck manufacturers to outsource production of cabs to independent bodybuilders, so their acquisition by Scania-Vabis seemed a good move. Be-Ge owner Bror Göthe Persson had also established an additional cab factory at Meppel.

Scania-Vabis continued their expansion of production facilities through acquisitions. In 1967, they acquired Katrineholm based coachwork company Svenska Karosseriverkstäderna (SKV), and created a new subsidiary, Scania-Bussar. A year later, all bus production, along with R&amp;D was moved to Katrineholm. Further production locations were added at Sibbhult and Falun, and Scania&#x27;s employee numbers rose, particularly at Södertälje, which was to help double the town&#x27;s population.

Scania-Vabis at some point in their history also manufactured trucks in Botswana, Brazil, South-Korea, Tanzania, the Netherlands, Zimbabwe and the United States.

For some time Daimler-Benz waged a &#x27;logo war&#x27; with Scania-Vabis, claiming a possible confusion between the Scania-Vabis &#x27;pedal crank&#x27; design featuring on Scania bicycles around 1900 and the Mercedes &#x27;three-pointed star&#x27;. In 1968, Daimler-Benz won and the Scania-Vabis logo changed to a simple griffin&#x27;s head on a white background.

In February 1968, a new range of trucks was launched, and at the same time the company was rebranded as just &quot;Scania&quot;. In addition to &quot;Vabis&quot; disappearing from the name and a new logo, all current models received new model designations.

===1970s and 1980s===

In 1976, the Argentine industrial complex was launched. A few months later, on 10 September, the first gearbox outside of Sweden was manufactured and finally in December an L111 truck became the first Scania made in Argentina. Soon the plant specialised in the production of gearboxes, axles and differentials that equipped both the units produced in Tucumán and those built in Brazil.

Also in Argentina, in 1982 the Series 2 was launched as part of the &quot;Scania Program&quot;, consisting of the T-112 and R-112 trucks with two cab versions and different options in engine and load capacity. In 1983, was launched the K112 made in Tucuman (like the rest models) for replace the BR-116.

In mid-1985 Scania entered the US market for the first time (aside from having sold 12,000 diesel engines installed in Mack trucks from 1962 until 1975), starting modestly with a goal of 200 trucks in all of 1987 (121 trucks were sold during calendar year 1986). Scania limited their marketing to New England, where conditions resemble those in Europe more closely.

Many examples of Scania, Vabis and Scania-Vabis commercial and military vehicles can be seen at the Marcus Wallenberg-hallen (the Scania Museum) in Södertälje.

==Ownership==

===Saab-Scania AB (1969–1995)===
On 1 September 1969, Scania merged with Saab AB, and formed Saab-Scania AB. When Saab-Scania was split in 1995, the name of the truck and bus division changed simply to &quot;Scania AB&quot;. One year later, Scania AB was introduced on the stock exchange, which resulted in a minor change of name to &quot;Scania AB (publ)&quot;.

===Aborted Volvo takeover===
On 7 August 1999, Volvo announced it had agreed to acquire a majority share in Scania. Volvo was to buy the 49.3% stake in Scania that was owned by Investor AB, Scania&#x27;s then main shareholder. The acquisition, for US$7.5 billion (60.7 billion SEK), would have created the world&#x27;s second-largest manufacturer of heavy trucks, behind DaimlerChrysler. The cash for the deal was to come from the sale of Volvo&#x27;s car division to Ford Motor Company in January 1999.

The merger failed, after the European Union disapproved, announcing one company would have almost 100% market share in the Nordic markets.

===Aborted MAN takeover===
In September 2006, the German truckmaker MAN AG launched a €10.3bn hostile offer to acquire Scania AB. Scania&#x27;s CEO Leif Östling was forced to apologise for comparing the bid of MAN to a &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;. MAN AG later dropped its hostile offer, but in January 2008, MAN increased their voting rights in Scania up to 17%.

===Volkswagen Group era===
The German automotive company Volkswagen Group gained ownership of Scania by first buying Volvo&#x27;s stake in 2000, after the latter&#x27;s aborted takeover attempt, increasing it to 36.4% in the first quarter 2007. It then bought out Investor AB in March 2008, raising its share to 70.94%. The deal was approved by regulatory bodies in July 2008. Scania then became the ninth marque in the Volkswagen Group. By 1 January 2015, the Volkswagen Group controlled 100% of the shares in Scania AB. In 2018, Volkswagen Truck &amp; Bus was rebranded Traton.

==Controversies==
===Price-fixing fines===
In September 2017, Scania was fined 880 million euros (8.45bn Swedish krona) by the EU for taking part in a 14-year price fixing cartel. The other five members of the cartel – Daimler, DAF, MAN, Iveco and Volvo/Renault – settled with the commission in 2016.

===Business in Russia===

On 13 September 2022, following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Scania declared a cessation of operations in Russia. Export sanctions and restrictions were enacted on Russia. In March, Scania stopped deliveries of trucks and parts to Russia, and ceased production in Saint Petersburg.

Scania announced the sale of assets of their company in Russia for 560 million USD. MAN Truck &amp; Bus SE and Scania AB are subsidiaries of Traton. They are selling their assets in Russia to local partners, while Scania is also divesting its Russian financing business, Traton said. The company said that all transactions will be completed in the first quarter of 2023.

==Products==
===Trucks and special vehicles===

Scania develops, manufactures and sells trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of more than 16 tonnes (Class 8), intended for long-distance haulage, regional, and local distribution of goods, as well as construction haulage.

The 1963 forward-control LB76 forged Scania-Vabis&#x27;s reputation outside Sweden, being one of the first exhaustively crash-tested truck cabs.

====Current====
All current trucks from Scania are part of the PRT-range, but are marketed as different series based on the general cab height.
*L-series – launched in December 2017. It has an even lower cab than the P-series, and is optimised for distribution and other short-haul duties.
*P-series – launched in August 2004, typical applications are regional and local distribution, construction, and various specialised operations associated with locally based transportation and services. P-series trucks have the new P cabs, which are available in several variations: a single-berth sleeper, a spacious day cab, a short cab and a crew cab
*G-series – launched in September 2007, the series offer an enlarged range of options for operators engaged in national long haul and virtually all types of construction applications. All models have a G cab, and each is available as a tractor or rigid. The G-series truck comes with five cab variants: three sleepers, a day cab and a short cab. There are different axle configurations, and in most cases a choice of chassis height and suspension
*R-series – launched in March 2004, and won the prestigious International Truck of the Year award in 2005 and again in 2010. The range offers various trucks optimised for long haulage. All models have a Scania R cab, and each vehicle is available as a tractor or rigid. There are different axle configurations and a choice of chassis height and suspension. The Scania R 730 is the most powerful variant of the R-series. Its 16.4-litre DC16 Turbo Diesel V8 engine produces at 1,900 rpm and of torque at 1,000–1,350 rpm.
*S-series – launched in August 2016. It is the highest cab Scania has ever built. It features a completely flat floor and a low bed that is extendable up to 100 cm (about 3.28 feet).

===Buses and coaches===
Scania&#x27;s bus and coach range has always been concentrated on chassis, intended for use with anything between tourist coaches to city traffic, but ever since the 1950s, when the company was still known as Scania-Vabis, they have manufactured complete buses for their home markets of Sweden and the rest of Scandinavia, and since the 1990s even for major parts of Europe.

====Chassis====

Scania-Vabis was involved in bus production from its earliest days, producing mail buses in the 1920s.
In 1946, the company introduced their B-series of bus chassis, with the engine mounted above the front-axle, giving a short front overhang and the door behind the front-axle. The first generation consisted of the B15/B16, the B20/B21/B22 and the B31, primarily divided by weight class, and then by wheelbase. The latter became upgraded in 1948 and renamed 2B20/2B21/2B22 and 3B31. The T31/T32 trolleybus chassis was also available from 1947. In 1950, the next generation was introduced, with the B41/B42, the B61/B62/B63/B64 and later the B83. From then, Scania-Vabis also offered the BF-series chassis, available as BF61/BF62/BF63, which had the engine more conventionally mounted before the front-axle, leaving room for the door on a longer front overhang. From 1954, the B-series came as B51 and B71, and the BF as BF71 and later BF73. In 1959, the B55, B65 and B75, plus the BF75 were introduced, and were from 1963 available as B56, B66 and B76, plus the BF56 and BF76.

Before the rebranding to Scania in 1968, Scania-Vabis had delivered a very limited number of CR76 chassis-frameworks (less actual bodywork) with transversally rear-mounted engine for external bodying, based on the complete bus with the same name. From 1968 it was also delivered as a standard bus chassis known as BR110. The other chassis models were renamed too, so the Scania-Vabis B56/B76 became the Scania B80/B110 and the BF56/BF76 became BF80/BF110. The numbers in the new model designations were based on the engine displacement (8 and 11-litre), a scheme that Scania used for almost 40 years.

In 1971, a new range of longitudinally mounted rear-engined chassis was launched, with the BR85 and its larger brother, the V8-powered 14-litre BR145, targeted at the coach market. In Brazil, the higher powered version was equipped with the standard 11-litre instead of the V8, known as the BR115. Also the BR111 was launched as the replacement for the BR110, being derived from the CR111 complete bus. In 1976, many of the models were renewed, and designations were upped from 80 and 85 to 86, and from 110 to 111, except the BR145 which was later replaced by the BR116 in 1978.

The BR112 was launched in 1978 as a forerunner to the 2-series, replacing the BR111. The rest of the 2-series were launched in 1981 with the F82/F112 replacing the BF86/BF111 and the S82/S112 replacing the B86/B111, and then in 1982 the K82/K112 replacing the BR86/BR116. The BR112 was then updated to the N112 in 1984, and a tri-axle version of the K112 became available, known as the K112T. In 1985, the K82 and F82 were replaced by the 8.5-litre engined K92 and F92. Front-engined versions were in general discontinued on the European markets in the mid-1980s, but production continued in Brazil.

In 1988, the 3-series was introduced, continuing the main models of the 2-series. In 1990, the new L113 became available, with a longitudinally rear-mounted engine which was inclined 60° to the left, to make a lower height than the K113. The 4-series was launched in 1997, continuing all model characteristics from the 3-series, but with all of them being just modular configurations of the basic chassis. The 8.5-litre engine was replaced by a 9-litre, and the 11-litre was replaced by an 11.7-litre. They were joined by a 10.6-litre engine in 2000.

The current &quot;Scania&#x27;s bus and coach range&quot; has been available since 2006, and is marketed as the K-series, N-series and F-series, based on the engine position.

====Complete buses====

Scania-Vabis&#x27; first complete bus model was the transversally rear-engined commuter bus Metropol (C50), which was built in the workshop in Södertälje on licence from the Mack C50 in 1953–1954 for customer Stockholms Spårvägar. It was followed in 1955 by the slightly shorter city bus version Capitol (C70/C75/C76), which was manufactured until 1964. In 1959, the front-engined CF-series was introduced with the CF65 and CF75 (later CF66 and CF76). The CF-series was built until 1966.

In 1965, the rear-engined CR76 was introduced as a replacement for the Capitol. It was available in two versions; the CR76M with double doors (2-2-0) for city and suburban traffic, and the CR76L with single doors (1-1-0) for longer distances. Because of Sweden&#x27;s switch to right-hand traffic in September 1967 and the need for new buses with doors on the right-hand side, the model sold well. With the rebranding from Scania-Vabis to Scania in 1968, the model was renamed CR110 (CR110M and CR110L). In 1967, the coachwork manufacturer Svenska Karosseri Verkstäderna (SKV) in Katrineholm was acquired, and all production of bus chassis soon moved there too. Together with the rebranding in 1968, Scania re-introduced the front-engined CF range for customers in Sweden as a body-on-chassis product with the newly acquired SKV&#x27;s former bodywork model &quot;6000&quot; on standard Scania chassis, but less than 100 were delivered until 1970. The CF110L (BF110 chassis) was the most successful, while a handful of C80L (B80) and C110L (B110) were made.

In 1971, the CR110 was upgraded and became the CR111. With extended sound-proofing for its time, it was marketed as the &quot;silent bus&quot;. The same year, Scania also introduced a new range of longitudally rear-engined coaches known as the CR85 and the CR145. While CR85 had the small 8-litre engine, the CR145 was powered by a 14-litre V8 engine. The coaches were built until 1978, but never sold very well. In 1973, one right-hand drive CR145 prototype was built in Sweden, with the finishing touches done by MCW, but it remained the only one of its kind. The CR111 was replaced by the all-new CR112 in 1978. With its angular design, the CR112 was called a &quot;shoebox&quot;. As with the BR112 chassis being renamed the N112, the CR112 was renamed the CN112 in 1984, and it was also launched in an articulated version. A North American version of the CN112 was built in around 250 units between 1984 and 1988. The CK112 was launched as a simple coach or intercity bus in 1986, sharing most of the styling with the CN112. With the launch of the 3-series in 1988, both the CN112 and CK112 were upgraded to CN113 and CK113. The CK113 was replaced by the L113-based CL113 in 1991 with new rectangular headlights, but production ended in 1992. Less than 100 units of the CK112/CK113/CL113 were ever built.

The MaxCi (CN113CLL), launched in 1992, was Scania&#x27;s first ever low-entry bus, with a low floor between the front and centre doors, and kneeling to make entering even easier. The bodywork was based on the CN113, but with a lowered window line in the front half, and a new front including the headlights from the CL113. In 1996, the aluminium body OmniCity was launched as Scania&#x27;s first full low-floor bus, and in 1998 the MaxCi was replaced by the OmniLink, which shared styling with the OmniCity. A step-entrance intercity bus returned with the OmniLine in 2000. In 2007, Scania returned to the complete coach market with the Finnish-built OmniExpress, which in 2011 even replaced the OmniLine, which had gone out of production in 2009.

Scania&#x27;s current styling was first seen in 2009, with the launch of the Touring coach, manufactured by Higer Bus in China, and in 2011 the Citywide was launched to replace both the OmniCity and the OmniLink. Scania in India launched their very own Metrolink coach in 2013, built at their plant there. The Interlink was then launched in October 2015 to replace the OmniExpress. The latest addition to Scania&#x27;s complete bus models is the Fencer range featuring buses to coaches, the F1 single decker bus was launched in May 2021 initially for the UK market and available in diesel and electric drivetrains.

====Buses through collaborations====

In addition to supplying chassis for external bodywork, and their own bodyworks, Scania have also collaborated with some bodywork manufacturers to deliver buses through Scania&#x27;s distribution lines, both on a global base and on smaller markets.

In 1969, Scania teamed up with MCW to make the Metro-Scania single-decker for the UK market based on the BR110MH, and since 1971 the BR111MH chassis. In 1973, it was replaced by the Metropolitan double-decker, built on the BR111DH chassis. Production ended in 1978, when the BR111 was replaced by the BR112. East Lancashire Coachbuilders (ELC) launched their low-entry MaxCi in 1993, one year after Scania&#x27;s own left-hand drive version. It was followed by the L113-based European in 1995 until 1996. In 2003, ELC was back with both the OmniDekka double-decker and the OmniTown midibus to complement Scania&#x27;s own OmniCity.

Since the mid-1990s, Scania started a long-lasting collaboration with Spanish bus builder Irizar to sell their coaches through Scania&#x27;s global distribution network. The agreement meant that Scania had exclusive distribution rights for all Irizar coaches in Northern Europe for many years. The most widespread model was the Irizar Century, but later also the Irizar PB was sold as Scania&#x27;s premium coach.

In 1985, Scania&#x27;s Norwegian distributor and the Finnish bus builder Ajokki announced the &quot;Scania Classic&quot;, a coach built exclusively for Norway. It was technically based on Ajokki&#x27;s own Royal coach model, but received its own styling details. In 1990, when Ajokki had become Carrus, the second generation was launched based on the Vector/Regal models. The third generation from 1995 was also available in Sweden and Finland in limited numbers, and the fourth and last generation from 2001 was built with the same bodywork as the Volvo 9700. Volvo, who had bought Carrus in 1998, put the foot down against any further Scanias with this bodywork from 2002, and since then Scania instead put the &quot;Classic&quot; sticker on all Irizar Century sold in Norway for several years. The collaboration also led to some Norway-exclusive intercity buses; the &quot;Scania Cruiser&quot; (Ajokki Victor), &quot;Scania Universal&quot; (Carrus Fifty) and &quot;Scania InterClassic&quot; (Carrus Vega), but neither of these had special styling, nor as successful as the Classic.

In 2006, Scania and Higer Bus announced the A80, the first coach in the Higer A Series of coaches built on Scania chassis in China. The coaches are generally available in Asia, but the A30 is also available in Europe as an affordable intercity bus or simple coach. Even the A80 is globally available, but under make-up known as the Scania Touring HD, also referred to as the A80T.

Since 2012, Scania and Belgian bus manufacturer Van Hool offer some of their most luxurious coaches from their TX series on Scania K EB chassis, including the Astronef with theatrical floor, the Astromega double-decker and the Altano. Since 2014, also the Exqui.City BRT concept is available on Scania N UA chassis with CNG-powered engines.

===Diesel engines===
In addition to bus and truck engines, Scania&#x27;s industrial and marine engines are used in generator sets and in earthmoving and agricultural machinery, as well as on board ships and pleasure crafts.

Scania&#x27;s involvement with internal combustion engine production dates back to 1897, when engineer Gustav Erickson designed the engine for the company&#x27;s first motor car. Over the subsequent years, Scania has grown to be one of the world&#x27;s most experienced engine manufacturers, building engines not only for trucks and buses, but also for marine and general industrial applications, which are exported across the globe.

Year in parentheses is first year of application in road vehicles.

<text>Constraint may refer to:
* Constraint (computer-aided design), a demarcation of geometrical characteristics between two or more entities or solid modeling bodies
* Constraint (mathematics), a condition of an optimization problem that the solution must satisfy
* Constraint (mechanics), a relation between coordinates and momenta
* Constraint (computational chemistry)
* Constraint (information theory), the degree of statistical dependence between or among variables
* &quot;Constraints&quot; (journal), a scientific journal
* Constraint (database), a concept in relational database

== Particular types of constraint ==
* Biological constraints, factors which make populations resistant to evolutionary change
* Carrier&#x27;s constraint on lung function in long thin animals
* Finite domain constraint, in mathematical solution-finding
* Integrity constraints in databases
** Check constraint
** Foreign key constraint
* Observational constraint in science, a constraint on a solution implied by previous observations
* Specific types of mechanical constraints:
** First-class constraint and second-class constraint in Hamiltonian mechanics
** Primary constraint, secondary constraint, etc. in Hamiltonian mechanics
** Holonomic constraints, also called integrable constraints, (depending on time and the coordinates but not on the momenta)
** Nonholonomic constraints
** Pfaffian constraint
** Scleronomic constraint (not depending on time)
** Rheonomic constraint (depending on time)

== See also ==
* Constrained optimization, in finance, linear programming, economics and cost modeling
* Constrained writing, in literature
* Constraint algorithm, such as SHAKE, or LINCS
* Constraint programming
* Constraint logic programming
* Constraint satisfaction, in computer science
