<text>The Tour of Flanders (), also known as &quot;De Ronde&quot; (&quot;The Tour&quot;), is an annual road cycling race held in Belgium every spring. The most important cycling race in Flanders, it is part of the UCI World Tour and organized by Flanders Classics. Its nickname is &quot;Vlaanderens Mooiste&quot; (Dutch for &quot;Flanders&#x27; Finest&quot;). First held in 1913, the Tour of Flanders had its 100th edition in 2016.

Today it is one of the five &quot;monuments&quot; of cycling, together with Milan–San Remo, Paris–Roubaix, Liège–Bastogne–Liège and the Giro di Lombardia. It is one of the two major Cobbled classics, anticipating Paris–Roubaix, which is on the calendar one week after the Tour of Flanders. The event had its only interruptions during World War I and has been organized without hiatus since 1919, the longest uninterrupted streak of any cycling classic.

Seven men hold the record of most victories, making the Tour of Flanders unique among the major classics. Belgians Achiel Buysse, Eric Leman, Johan Museeuw, and Tom Boonen, Italian Fiorenzo Magni, Dutch Mathieu van der Poel and Swiss Fabian Cancellara each have three victories.

Since 2004, a women&#x27;s race has been organized on the same day as the men&#x27;s over a shorter distance. Since 2021, the women&#x27;s race shares the &quot;Tour of Flanders&quot; name with the men&#x27;s race. To distinguish between them, they are now categorised as the &#x27;Elite Men&#x27; and &#x27;Elite Women&#x27; editions.

==Creation==

===The Ronde as a regional symbol===
The Tour of Flanders was conceived in 1913 by Léon van den Haute, co-founder of the sports newspaper &quot;Sportwereld&quot;. In the era it was customary for publishers of newspapers and magazines to organise cycling races as a means of promoting circulation.
By the beginning of the 20th century, cycling was in a poor state in Belgium. Velodromes were closing and national championships on the road or track were no longer organised. The one major Belgian race, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, was in the French-speaking South. As the gloom increased, Odile Defraye became the first Belgian winner of the Tour de France in 1912. He was a 20-year-old Fleming and, although he rode for Alcyon, a French team, he symbolized a potential rise for Belgian cycling. Defraye&#x27;s victory inspired August De Maeght, mayor of Halle and director of the press group &quot;Société Belge d&#x27;Imprimerie&quot;, to publish a Dutch-language sports magazine called &quot;Sportwereld&quot;.

&quot;Sportwereld&quot;&#x27;s most prominent cycling writer was Karel Van Wijnendaele, a young sports journalist and passionate cycling fan who had tried cycle-racing himself. The first issue appeared in time for the Championship of Flanders on 12 September 1912. Van Wijnendaele became the editor of Sportwereld on 1 January 1913.

===The Ronde and Flemish nationalism===

Much has been written about the link between cycling in Flanders and Flemish nationalism. Van Wijnendaele wanted to create a race run entirely on Flemish soil, crossing as many cities as possible, because &quot;all Flemish cities had to contribute to the liberation of the Flemish people&quot;.

The Tour of Flanders is the only classic to have been held on German-occupied territory during the Second World War and in full agreement with the German command. The Germans not only allowed and enjoyed the race but helped police the route as well. This led to accusations of collaboration in an age where many Flemish nationalists had strong ties with Nazi Germany. After the War, &quot;De Standaard&quot; and &quot;Het Algemeen Nieuws-Sportwereld&quot; were sequestered by the state and several journalists, largely non-sports reporters, were sentenced for collaboration. Van Wijnendaele was forbidden to work as a journalist for life – a ban lifted when he produced a letter of support from General Montgomery, confirming that he had hidden downed British pilots during the war and had protected them in his house.

A rival Flemish newspaper, &quot;Het Volk&quot;, started the &quot;Omloop van Vlaanderen&quot; in 1945. Het Volk wanted to initiate a new cycling event in Flanders as a rival race to what it saw as the Ronde&#x27;s closeness to the Nazis. The Ronde&#x27;s organizers protested that the name was too close to their own – in Dutch there is little difference between &quot;Ronde&quot; and &quot;Omloop&quot;. The Belgian cycling federation demanded that Het Volk change the name of their event. That race became the Omloop Het Volk, nowadays the opening race of the Belgian cycling season.

==History==

===The first races===

On 25 May 1913 Karel van Wijnendaele organized the first Tour of Flanders, crossing the two western provinces of Flanders. It started at six in the morning in Ghent and finished in Mariakerke, now a suburb of Ghent. It covered , all on bad roads with just the occasional cycle path. The race finished on a wooden velodrome that circled a pond in Mariakerke, where ticket sales covered only half the prizes.
The first race in 1913 was won by 25-year-old Paul Deman, who won the sprint of a six-man group after more than 12 hours in the saddle. Deman went on to win Bordeaux–Paris in 1914, but his career almost ended with World War I. He joined Belgium&#x27;s espionage underground war effort and smuggled documents into the neutral Netherlands by bike. After many trips he was arrested by the Germans, jailed in Leuven and held for execution. The Armistice of 1918 saved his life and he became a war hero.

The first race consisted of 37 riders, followed by five assistance cars. In 1914 the field was 47 and the organization still struggled to find enough financial resources. A disappointed van Wijnendaele later said:

&quot;Sportwereld was so young and so small for the big Ronde that we wanted. We had bitten off more than we could chew. It was hard, seeing a band of second-class riders riding across Flanders, scraping up a handful of centimes to help cover the costs. The same happened in 1914. No van Hauwaert, no Masselis, no Defraeye, no Mosson, no Mottiat, no Van Den Berghe, all forbidden to take part by their French bike companies.&quot;

However, there were hints of the growing status of the race as a symbol of Flemish nationalism (see above). Marcel Buysse, one of Flanders&#x27; cycling icons in the early 20th century, insisted on entering the race, against the order of his French Alcyon team that forbade Belgian riders to participate. Buysse took part in the second edition in 1914 as one of the favourites and won the sprint of a group of six on the velodrome of Evergem, in the vicinity of Ghent. The distance was scaled back to .

===1920s: Birth of a legend===

The Tour of Flanders was interrupted for the duration of World War I and was resumed again without interruptions as from 1919. The interwar editions were marked by appalling road conditions and grisly landscapes in war-ridden Flanders, but the Tour of Flanders gained popularity fast.

In the 1920s Flemish track specialists dominated the race. Gérard Debaets, a specialist of six-day racing in the American circuit, won the race twice; in 1924 as one of only 17 finishers in dreadful weather conditions. Swiss Heiri Suter became the first foreign winner in 1923 and achieved the first ever cobbled races &quot;double&quot; win with Paris–Roubaix one week later. In 1926, a group of ten sprinted to the finish. Five of them crashed heavily and Denis Verschueren, competing in his first race as a professional, won the event.

The start and finish of the race in Ghent started to attract hordes of fans and by the end of the 1920s, the &quot;Ronde&quot; had become the pinnacle of the cycling season in Flanders.

===1930s: Problems of success===

If the first &quot;Rondes&quot; were held to limited public success, by the 1930s its popularity had grown so spectacularly that vast masses of spectators along the roads and cars following the race had turned the Tour of Flanders into a true cultural festival. By 1933, there were 164 participants and seven times as many cars and motorbikes in the race caravan. This booming of the event brought inevitable problems of safety. In 1937 writer and Flemish literary icon Stijn Streuvels wrote to &quot;Sportwereld&quot; that the Ronde, as seen from his house in Ingooigem, was &quot;more a procession of cars than of riders.&quot;

Race director Karel van Wijnendaele spoke of a &quot;wild rodeo&quot; of spectators driving behind the race and seeking shortcuts across the course to see the race several times. He claimed the police estimated the crowd for early races at 500,000. People followed the race in cars, overtook it when they could, or stood so thick by the roadside in villages and at control points that the riders sometimes had trouble passing.
In 1933, Van Wijnendaele involved the gendarmerie to control the plague of race-followers as much as possible, but to limited effect. The 1937 race was exceptionally chaotic with several accidents, causing race organizers to have the entire course secured by motorized police, in those days a revolutionary move. From then, the situation started to improve somewhat.

In sporting terms, the race grew more international with participants from France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Czechoslovakia. Belgians continued to dominate however and Romain Gijssels became the first to win two consecutive Rondes. The editions of 1934 and 1935 were exceptionally rainy, making the races gruelling contests of perseverance.

====Conditions for riders====
The Ronde, in its first decades, followed the general rule that each racer was responsible for his own problems. Help from others was banned and riders carried spare tyres looped round their shoulders to cope with punctures. It could take two or three minutes to change and inflate a tyre, longer if it was cold or there were other problems. Tyres weighed around 500g (compared to currently around 200g). A rim or any other part of the bike that broke spelled the end of the race and still left the rider with the problem of getting to the finish.

Conditions improved in the 1930s and riders were allowed to accept a rain jacket, a spare tyre and a pump, but only in an emergency and at the judges&#x27; discretion. A change of bike was allowed only if a frame, wheel or handlebar broke, but riders were still expected to ride with spare tyres and a pump. Riders in the 1940s had to hand their bikes to officials the day before the race to have them identified with a lead seal, later with a ring similar to that fitted to racing pigeons. In that way the judges, or commissaires, could see if a rider had illegally changed bikes.

The Ronde moved towards modern rules in 1951, with riders being allowed limited help from team cars and to combine with others from the same team on the road. By 1955 it was possible to accept a replacement bike from a teammate but not from a car. The rules changed from year to year until they resembled those of today by the end of the 1950s.

====Prizes====
Prizes for the first race in 1913 came to 1,100 Belgian francs. By 1935 the fees and bonuses had increased to 12,500 francs, with 2,500 for the winner down to 125 francs for the 19th-place finisher (at a time when a newspaper cost 40 cents). In 1938 there was a bonus of 100 francs for any rider who had a lead of 30 minutes. Prizes during the war years were whatever the organisers could find, including boxes of razors, a stove, bottles of wine and cycling equipment. There were 100 francs in 1948 &quot;for the last rider to reach the finish in Eeklo.&quot; The last four riders in 1949 were given bottles of massage oil.

===1940s: War years and resurrection===

In 1939, as World War II loomed, organizing magazine &quot;Sportwereld&quot; merged with &quot;Het Nieuwsblad&quot;, a popular daily newspaper. During the war, many sporting events were cancelled, but the Tour of Flanders continued to be organized in agreement with the German command. The first wartime race in 1941 was won by Achiel Buysse. Because of road restrictions, the course was altered to poorly surfaced roads and paths, starting and finishing in Ghent and totalling just .

Despite the war conditions, the 1940s were the remarkable scene of some of the race&#x27;s most famous champions. Achiel Buysse became the first rider to win three times. Briek Schotte and Rik Van Steenbergen gained two victories and became the leading figures of Belgian cycling. Schotte linked his named indelibly to the race with two victories, 20 starts, eight podium finishes and several memorable exploits. In 1944 young Rik Van Steenbergen controlled the race, distanced his rival Briek Schotte in the final kilometres and stunned followers by becoming the youngest winner ever at 19.

In 1948 the Tour of Flanders was included in the first running of the Challenge Desgrange-Colombo, cycling&#x27;s first international season-long competition, which had spurred its status as an international event. Until the Second World War, the Tour of Flanders had been held on the same day as Milan–San Remo, Italy&#x27;s biggest cycling classic. Prominent Italian and French riders preferred the latter which explains why there was only a single non-Belgian winner before the war. The organisers changed the date to meet the needs of the Challenge Desgrange-Colombo. The 1948 edition featured a record 265 participants, of which 50 non-Belgians, the largest peloton ever to take the start. Briek Schotte won his second &quot;Ronde&quot;.

===1950s: International Classic===
Italian Fiorenzo Magni was the first exponent of the internationalization. The Tuscan achieved an unprecedented three consecutive victories in just four participations. The Tours of 1950 and 1951 set the tone, with solo wins by the Italian in cold weather. In 1951 Magni attacked with to go and finished 5&#x27; 35&quot; ahead of Frenchman Bernard Gauthier. Attilio Redolfi came in third at 10&#x27; 32&quot; from Magni. In 1955 cycling great Louison Bobet, by then a two-times winner of the Tour de France, became the first French winner. Another Frenchman, Jean Forestier, won the following year. Flemish fans needed to get used to the many foreign riders excelling in Flanders, but the international prestige of the race increased fast.

===1960s: Ever-growing popularity===
In 1961 Tom Simpson became the first British winner in a controversial two-man sprint against Italian Nino Defilippis. Defilippis was the faster sprinter, but stopped pedalling too early because a finishing banner had been blown away and was foiled by Simpson.

The influence of spectators never ended. Crowds stood in huge masses along the roads and the finish was moved to Gentbrugge, in order to cope with the ever-growing number of spectators. Rik Van Looy took his second win in 1962 as world champion amid hordes of fans, securing his status as flag-bearer of Belgian cycling.

In 1969 the young Eddy Merckx, on his way to becoming a cycling legend, took over this role when he broke clear from the pack with to go. In bad weather and despite objection from his team manager, he maintained his effort and won the race 5&#x27; 36&quot; ahead of Felice Gimondi, the biggest margin ever.

===1970s: Controversies and doping===
In the 1970s the Tour of Flanders needed a new identity. The asphalting of many of the traditional roads and hills made the race less demanding and more riders were able to keep up with the best. Eric Leman became the local hero when he won three times in four years, thereby equalling Buysse and Magni&#x27;s record. Sprint specialist Leman outsprinted Eddy Merckx as part of a select group on each of his wins, much to the discontent of fans and organisers.

In order to preserve the &quot;Ronde&#x27;s&quot; specific character, organisers increased the number of hills and searched for more backroads in the Flemish Ardennes. In 1973 the finish was moved to Meerbeke, not far after the Muur of Geraardsbergen, which became an iconic climb of the race and of Belgian cycling. Three years later the controversial Koppenberg was included.
It marked the beginning of some sensational editions of the race. In 1975 Eddy Merckx concluded his second win after another memorable raid to the finish. Merckx, in the rainbow jersey, escaped from the peloton together with Frans Verbeeck with to ride, before distancing his worn-out companion before Meerbeke. In 1976 Freddy Maertens and Roger De Vlaeminck, two of Belgium&#x27;s star riders, were part of a five-man group and favourites to win the sprint, but the two did not get on and let themselves jointly be dropped at from the finish. De Vlaeminck beat Maertens for fourth place, acknowledging his mistake, but stated that &quot;he did not want Maertens to win&quot;.

In 1977 their rivalry culminated in what became a peculiar race. Maertens punctured on the Koppenberg and was given a wheel by a spectator who pushed him all the way up. De Vlaeminck broke clear, but punctured shortly after and was caught by a returning Maertens. As both riders were alone at the front of the race, De Vlaeminck refused to work. For , Maertens rode to the finish with De Vlaeminck on his wheel and was easily beaten by the latter in a two-man sprint. It was De Vlaeminck&#x27;s only win. To this day, both protagonists make contradictory statements about what happened. Maertens stated that the judges had told him he would be disqualified for his illegal wheel-change and that De Vlaeminck had offered him 300.000 francs to keep riding. De Vlaeminck denies this, saying that he tactically stayed on Maertens&#x27; wheel, whom he considered the better sprinter. After the race, the controversy heightened even more, when Maertens and third-place finisher Walter Planckaert tested positive for doping and were both disqualified.

===1980s: Dutch and Belgians===
The 1980s were monopolized by Dutch and Belgian riders. Dutchman Jan Raas won twice and in 1986 Adri van der Poel concluded the fifth win in seven years by a Dutch rider. Van der Poel beat Ireland&#x27;s Sean Kelly and Canadian Steve Bauer in a four-man sprint.

However, the decade will forever be remembered for the apocalyptic edition of 1985, won by Eric Vanderaerden. The 23-year-old Belgian suffered a broken wheel before the Koppenberg, but returned to the front of the race in a group with Hennie Kuiper, Greg LeMond and his teammate Phil Anderson. Vanderaerden, considered a sprinter, attacked on the Muur of Geraardsbergen and rounded off a solo break. The race gained a place in cycling legend because a severe storm broke out in the second half of the race, with strong winds and torrential rainfall ravaging the peloton. Only 24 of 174 starters finished the race, the lowest number in modern times.

In 1987 Claude Criquielion became the first French-speaking Belgian winner, with an attack after the Bosberg, thereby relegating Sean Kelly to second place again. Classics specialist Kelly finished second on three occasions, but the &quot;Ronde&quot; remained the only monument classic he never won.

===1990s: Lion of Flanders===
In 1989 the race was included in the first UCI Road World Cup, a season-long competition comprising the 10 most important one-day cycling events. More riders specialized in the classics, with the Tour of Flanders scheduled as the first of the &quot;April Classics&quot;.

In 1993 Belgian Johan Museeuw won the race in a two-man sprint with Frans Maassen and began to dominate the race for years. Meanwhile, the Italian classics specialists were also keen on winning the race, with Moreno Argentin, Gianni Bugno and Michele Bartoli each taking one win. In 1994 Bugno beat Museeuw by in a four-man sprint, the smallest margin in history. The next day Flemish newspaper &quot;Het Laatste Nieuws&quot; put the photo finish on its cover, accompanied by the headline &quot;The Sorrow of Flanders&quot;. Nonetheless, Museeuw dominated the race for a decade, with a series of eight podium finishes and three victories. The Flemish media awarded him the highest possible nickname, the Lion of Flanders.

===21st century: Monument race===

Classic riders Gianluca Bortolami and Andrea Tafi continued an Italian tradition with victories in the early 2000s. In 2005 the race was included in the inaugural UCI Pro Tour and in 2011 in its successor, the World Tour, so establishing its status as one of the five &quot;monuments&quot; on the cycling calendar. Tom Boonen became the new star of Belgian cycling with two consecutive victories.

In 2010 Boonen, seeking his third win, attacked with Fabian Cancellara from the finish. Boonen was favourite to win, but could not keep up with Cancellara&#x27;s high-paced attack on the Muur van Geraardsbergen. The Swiss time trial specialist powered on in the final to his first win.

In 2011 the Tour of Flanders was taken over by &quot;Flanders Classics&quot;, which owns most of the Flemish classic races. In their first decision, the new organizers restyled the race and moved the finish to Oudenaarde in 2012. The edition saw Tom Boonen taking his third and final win in a three-man sprint against Italians Ballan and Pozzato. The two following years were again dominated by Fabian Cancellara who based his wins on attacks on the Oude Kwaremont. In 2015 both Boonen and Cancellara were unable to participate because of injuries, and Alexander Kristoff became the first Norwegian winner of the race.

In 2016 the Tour of Flanders celebrated its 100th edition, anticipated by a highly mediatized promotional campaign. The edition was won by Peter Sagan, who confirmed his status as the new foremost classics rider in the peloton.

The 2020 Tour of Flanders was moved to October and shortened by 12km due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, race organisers Flanders Classics unified the branding of the race, with the women&#x27;s race sharing the &quot;Tour of Flanders&quot; name with the men&#x27;s race. To distinguish between the two, they are now categorised as the &#x27;Elite Men&#x27; and &#x27;Elite Women&#x27; editions.

==Route==

===Present course===

Since 2017, the Tour of Flanders starts in the city of Antwerp. Following a flat run-in of during which the race passes the towns of Sint-Niklaas, Aalst, Zottegem, and passes the Paddestraat, the racers reach the town of Oudenaarde with the &quot;Centrum Ronde van Vlaanderen&quot; and shortly thereafter the village of Berchem, where the decisive part of the race starts.

Since 2012, the latter part of the race consists of three loops in the Flemish Ardennes with a finish in Oudenaarde. These take place in the southern part of East Flanders, with short forays into the provinces of West Flanders and Hainaut. These loops consist of a succession of hills &quot;(hellingen)&quot; and a few flat sections of cobbled roads, which determine the nature of the race. The hills offer many opportunities to attack and are usually the decisive sites of the race. These climbs are notorious for being short but very steep, and most of them - but not all - are cobbled.

Most of the climbs are located in a relatively small area, causing the roads to turn constantly and often abruptly, which explains the winding and irregular trajectory of the finale. The Oude Kwaremont is the first and longest climb at : an atypical hill because it is not very steep, but considered one of the most arduous climbs in Flanders because of its length and cobbled surface. The steepest of all is the fully cobbled Koppenberg, in length with grueling stretches of 22% over a poorly paved narrow road.

The last two climbs of the race, the Oude Kwaremont and the Paterberg, are both tackled twice in a finishing circuit. During the last loop, the Oude Kwaremont comes at from the finish and the Paterberg at , often marking the decisive sites of the race. After the Paterberg comes a flat run-in towards the finish, totalling .

===Course changes===
Like most of cycling&#x27;s classics, the route has developed considerably over the years, but it has always been run in the provinces of East Flanders and West Flanders. In the first 30 years the race was run from Ghent to Ghent, although the location of the finish in Ghent changed every few years.

The first edition of 1913 headed eastward to Sint-Niklaas before following a clockwise circle through Aalst, Oudenaarde, Kortrijk, Veurne all the way to the seashore in Ostend and via Roeselare back to Ghent. This course visited all the major cities of the two western provinces of Flanders. The course of 1914 was similar, but without the leg to the coast.

In 1919 the direction switched to a counter-clockwise course, turning south in Bruges. In 1920 the route extended to the coast again, heading out past Bruges to run along the North Sea from Blankenberge to Ostend. The general route remained this way until 1938. Race director Karel Van Wijnendaele insisted on including the coast to the course because of his sentimental vision of Flanders. The stretches of road along the sea were often accompanied by strong winds that inhibited attacks but scattered the peloton and spelled the end for those left behind the shelter of the main pack. &quot;Turning left at the sea&quot; meant that the wind blew from the side, producing a diagonal line of riders, each sheltering the other, typical of the Ronde and other Flemish races.
The passage along the coast was removed when war broke out in Europe, as access to the sea was restricted. The wartime route was a loop through the interior of Flanders, but in 1946 the race returned to its pre-war route. In 1952 the ride along the coast was abandoned for nine years, then returned in 1961, only to disappear again in 1964.

In 1973 the race had a new finish in Meerbeke, for the first time since its inception that the finish was outside the vicinity of Ghent. The race was no longer a loop and the new finish was much closer to the &quot;hill zone&quot;, offering opportunities to include new climbs in the course finale. The Muur van Geraardsbergen, with gradients touching 20% and its top at from the finish, was often the site where protagonists launched their decisive attacks. From 1973 to 2011, the Muur constituted a pairing with the Bosberg, the final climb at from the finish. The steep Muur in the center of Geraardsbergen, with its prominent chapel at the top, became one of the iconic sites of Belgian cycling and cycling in general.

In 1998 the start moved to Bruges, making a seaside passage possible again, but preserving the traditional finale over the Muur and Bosberg.

In 2012, the finish was changed to Oudenaarde, to the west of Geraardsbergen, thereby excluding both the Muur and Bosberg from the race course. The final climbs are since then Oude Kwaremont and Paterberg.

In 2017 the start was moved to Antwerp for the next five years and the Muur was placed back on the route, which still finished in Oudenaarde. It remained in the race in the 2018 edition, with the climb beginning into the race and finishing with remaining.

===Start locations===
The Tour of Flanders has started in four different cities – Ghent, Sint-Niklaas, Bruges and Antwerp. The start of the inaugural event in 1913 was on the Korenmarkt in Ghent&#x27;s historic city center. Ghent, the largest city of East and West Flanders, hosted the 1913 World&#x27;s Fair at the time of the race. Later, the official start in Ghent moved to the fashionable &quot;Albert Hotel&quot;, close to &quot;St-Pieters Station&quot;, where riders signed on. Until the 1950s a Sunday Mass was held for riders before the start, as the race was often held just before the Holy Week or on Easter day.

In 1977 Sint-Niklaas replaced Ghent as the starting location of the race, mainly because it had more space to accommodate the growing number of spectators on its large market square. Race briefings were held in the monumental city hall. By 1988 the start had grown into a highly mediatized two-day event with a spectacle presented by Flemish television on the evening of the race.

In 1998 the start of the Tour of Flanders moved to Bruges, a UNESCO World Heritage Site known for its illustrious history and medieval architecture, as part of the city&#x27;s promotional campaign. The move from Sint-Niklaas to Bruges brought criticism unrelated to the route change. Until then it had been a tradition that spectators could mix and meet with riders before the start. Nonetheless, most Flemish fans and &quot;traditionalists&quot; were enthusiastic of the new starting place, praising Bruges&#x27; historic site and its closeness to the coast, which made it possible again for the race to pass by the seashore.

As from 2017, the start of the race is in Antwerp, Flanders&#x27; largest city. The move will mark the first time the race passes through the province of Antwerp, as well as the first start outside the historical County of Flanders. The change was considered revolutionary, and the decision caused great division among Flemish cycling fans.

===Finish locations===
The finish in 1913 was on the velodrome of Mariakerke, part of greater Ghent, but failed to have the aspired success. It moved in 1914 to the &quot;Deeske Porter&quot; velodrome in neighbouring Evergem where, Van Wijnendaele recounted tongue-in-cheek, &quot;there were a good 20 spectators more than the previous year.&quot;

Wetteren hosted the finish from 1928 until 1961 with some interruptions during World War II, when it was moved to Ghent. Fiorenzo Magni won his three Tours of Flanders in Wetteren&#x27;s city center. From 1962 to 1972 the finish was in a residential neighbourhood in nearby Gentbrugge, on the outskirts of Ghent.

From 1973 to 2011 the finish was in Meerbeke, part of the municipality of Ninove, some west of Brussels. For 39 years the race finished on the Halsesteenweg, with a finishing straight of going slightly uphill in the final meters.

In September 2011, it was announced that Oudenaarde would be the new host city to finish the Tour of Flanders, thereby ending a 39-year tradition of finishing in Meerbeke. The new arrival was part of a restyling of the race by new organiser Flanders Classics, which also saw the introduction of &quot;loops&quot; in the course. Many fans and followers were upset with the altered race finale, and the organisation&#x27;s decision was met with resistance.

==Race characteristics==

===Nature of the race===
The Tour of Flanders is known for being a strategic race, where race favourites have multiple opportunities of planning their decisive attacks. The tactical part of the race begins in the hilly region of the Flemish Ardennes, where teams and riders often have to react to unpredictable developments and &quot;shadow favourites&quot; make anticipatory moves.

The steep nature of these hills favours an aggressive, attacking style of riding, making the Tour of Flanders an attractive race for viewing audiences. The peloton often rushes furiously over the narrow roads towards the climbs as teams try to position their captains in the front of the group. A climb is usually followed by a bigger road for some recovery, before taking the next small roads and climb again.

As most hills are in rural locations or along small villages, the climbs themselves and the roads leading to them are often narrow, causing the peloton to stretch into a long line and frequently break into smaller groups. Consequently, the best riders are forced to continually fight for space at the front of the pack. The race is therefore both renowned and notorious for its nervous course, with some favourites falling behind early in the race because of a crash or puncture, often unable to return to the front of the race.
As a consequence, the element of &quot;luck&quot; is arguably one of the reasons why there has never been a rider able to win the Tour of Flanders more than three times, as even the best and greatest specialists of their time suffer bad luck or are foiled by unpredictable race circumstances occasionally.

Since the race&#x27;s restyling in 2012, the climbs of Oude Kwaremont, Paterberg and Koppenberg, just south of Oudenaarde, are the heart of the action. The Kwaremont is a long section of cobbles that starts sharply before gradually levelling out. It is the site where powerful riders often make the race-winning move, as Fabian Cancellara demonstrated in 2013, when he attacked with Peter Sagan on the lower slopes of Kwaremont before distancing the Slovak on the Paterberg. The Paterberg is the final climb of the day where fans create a carnival-like atmosphere. It is a short but cobbled climb and viciously steep. After of racing, it is generally an ultimate test of endurance and strength.

The race culture and primal competition is an identifying factor of the Tour of Flanders. Two-time winner Peter Van Petegem stated:
===The climbs===
The short, sharp hills in the Flemish Ardennes are a defining feature of the Ronde and the places where spectators gather in vast numbers to see the race. In recent editions 17 to 19 of these hills are included in the route, although the number is subject to change as some climbs are cut and others included almost every year. Each climb has its own characteristics that present different challenges to the riders. The Kwaremont, is but relatively shallow. The Paterberg is short and, at 20 percent, brutally steep. The Koppenberg in Melden is the steepest hill of the race at 22 percent with a bad, very uneven cobbled surface. Its road is also extremely narrow and the high banking on either side turns it into a natural arena. Other famous climbs include the Eikenberg, Molenberg and Taaienberg.

The Koppenberg has been dropped some years because it was deemed too difficult and too dangerous. Particularly when wet weather had made the cobbles slippery, it was hard for riders to take the steep slopes all the way riding. One rider falling could bring many others down and, in turn, halt those behind, who often had to shoulder their bikes and run up the remainder of the hill. In 1984 only two riders – Phil Anderson and Jan Raas – got to the top on their bikes. In 1987 Danish rider Jesper Skibby slipped and fell on the slick cobbles, before being run over by an official&#x27;s car who tried to pass him. The climb was subsequently banned from the Tour of Flanders for the next 15 years.

The Koppenberg returned in 2002 after its surface was repaved. It was briefly dropped in 2007 but was included again in 2008 after the city of Oudenaarde had renovated it. It is now a permanent part of the course. Following cars are diverted before the foot of the climb to avoid chaos.

In 2015, the 19 climbs were:

===Cobbled roads===

Additional to the hills, the course traditionally includes a number of flat sections of cobbled roads. Recent editions included the Paddestraat (2400m), Mater-Kerkgate (3000m), Haaghoek (2000m) and Mariaborrestraat (2400m). Only the Mariaborrestraat comes in the race finale, as it also comprises the climbs of the Steenbeekdries and the descent of the Stationsberg. Unlike the fearful sections of &quot;pavé&quot; in Paris–Roubaix, these roads are in excellent condition nowadays as they are part of a busy traffic network. They haven&#x27;t been the decisive sites of the race for decades, but many &quot;purists&quot; of the Tour of Flanders want to keep them included because of their value as symbols of Flemish landscapes.

Until the 1950s the many dirt roads and cobbled roads were crucial sites in the race. Historian Tom Van Laere states that the Tour of Flanders had never set out to use poor roads – cobblestoned roads were all that were available if the race were to be long enough. In the Interwar period, Belgium&#x27;s infrastructure was severely scarred by war and only the intercity roads were smooth. Roads were laid in cobblestones, simply because it was the cheapest material at the time. After the Second World War, Belgium picked itself up from devastation and provinces began asphalting roads.
When some of the iconic hills were asphalted, cycling fans and organizers were alarmed by the disappearance of cobbles. Organizer Van Wijnendaele could no longer rely on many of the traditional roads as they were not difficult enough. His staff began searching for alleys and footpaths in maps and talked to people in bars who knew the local roads. &quot;It was either that or risk the race ending in a mass sprint, and that&#x27;s the last thing organizers wanted,&quot; said Van Laere. Most back roads happened to be in the low hills between Ronse and Geraardsbergen, the region that became the heart of the race.

Over the years the mileage of cobbles decreased but the number of cobbled hills rose. The climb of the Paterberg was unpaved until 1986, when its cycling-mad owner paved the road in cobbles because he wanted the race to pass by his house. The site was immediately included by race organizers and has become a fixture in the course.

Several of the remaining cobbled roads in Flanders, including the Paterberg, are now protected sites and classified as part of Flemish cultural heritage.

===Weather===
As with most cycling races, weather conditions have a significant influence in the nature of the day&#x27;s race. In bad weather conditions, the race is often a gruelling contest and the peloton is thinned out in the early parts of the race. In modern times, the edition of 1985 was hit by exceptionally stormy weather and only saw 24 finishers. When weather conditions are good, the teams of race favourites can control the race more easily and more riders are able to keep up with the pace. As the weather in April is highly unpredictable in Flanders, the race has repeatedly been affected by rough weather conditions.
Founder Karel Van Wijnendaele was keen on bad weather. He wanted the Tour of Flanders to be a symbol of Flemish culture and a metaphor of the country. As a journalist, he romanticized the race&#x27;s protagonists in the image of the Flemish people of the time: hard-working, struggling men in a constant battle with the elements. His rhetoric, combined with often harsh conditions, contributed to the image of the Tour of Flanders as a &quot;character race&quot; where only the most headstrong and physically robust could win.

==Rider characteristics==

Since the early years, winners of the Tour of Flanders acquired the literary epithet &quot;Flandrien&quot; or &quot;Flahute&quot; – a French term eagerly used by the Flemish press. &quot;Flandriens&quot; were riders with a formidable durability who were able to ride fast all day, over vast distances and in all weathers. Their exploits helped cement bike racing as the foremost sport in Flanders.

Because of its demanding course and specific characteristics, the Tour of Flanders has favoured a certain type of cyclists in modern times, known as &quot;classics specialists&quot; or specialists of the cobbled classics. Main contenders must possess a broad range of athletic potential in order to win. The aggressive nature of the climbs favours explosive riders, but the length of the race requires the highest level of fitness and durability.

Although the race has never ended in a mass sprint, sprinters often do well, especially those who evolved into classic riders, like Tom Boonen or Alexander Kristoff. Time trial specialist Fabian Cancellara successfully focused on the cobbled classics, thereby using his ability to maintain a high pace as a strong weapon on the last hills and on the flat run-in to the finish. Cancellara finished solo on two of his three wins.

Many recent top-placed finishers of the cobbled classics share the same physical attributes. Record winners Johan Museeuw [ and ], Tom Boonen [ and ] and Fabian Cancellara [ and ], totalling nine combined victories, are all powerful riders and among the &quot;heavier&quot; types of cyclists. Recent Norwegian winner and classics specialist Alexander Kristoff is in the same range at 181 cm and 78 kg.

These physical features are not absolute however. Two-times winner Peter Van Petegem [ and ] and 2011 winner Nick Nuyens [ and ] were noticeably smaller riders.

==Notable editions==

===1919: Van Lerberghe&#x27;s speech===
Gabe Konrad writes: &quot;The 1919 winner, van Lerberghe, showed up on the line in full racing attire but, for some reason, without a bike. He borrowed one from the brother-in-law of another competitor and, prior to the starting gun, threatened the pack that he was going to drop them all at their own front doors on the way to victory. Van Lerberghe hadn&#x27;t had, and would never have, an impressive career, and all the cyclists laughed as he pulled away immediately – never to be caught. Just prior to entering the velodrome for the finish, van Lerberghe stopped off at a pub to take in a few beers. His manager, worrying that he would miss a chance at victory, had to track him down and get him back on the bike. After he had crossed the line and done his lap of honour, van Lerberghe stood in front of the crowd and, in all seriousness, told them &#x27;to go home; I&#x27;m half a day ahead of the field.&#x27;&quot;

===1939: Kaers&#x27; training ride===
Karel Kaers, the youngest man to win the world road championship, also won the Ronde in 1939 – without intending to. For him, it was training for Paris–Roubaix. He drove to the Kwaremont hill near Kluisbergen, parked his car, then rode to the start in Ghent. His plan was to ride round the course with his usual training partner, stop when he got to his car, then drive home. Knowing he wasn&#x27;t riding the whole distance, Kaers jumped clear of the field – again as training – and rode up the Kwaremont with a minute&#x27;s lead. But his car wasn&#x27;t there. He pressed on instead and won the race. His manager had driven the car away to save Kaers from temptation.

===1944: Van Steenbergen&#x27;s lucky day===
Rik Van Steenbergen said: &quot;When I turned pro, I couldn&#x27;t ride it straight away. There were three categories of rider: road-riders A, road-riders B, and track riders. I was registered with the federation as a track rider. At first they wouldn&#x27;t let me ride the national championship. But Jean van Buggenhout, the manager, got me reclassified on the Wednesday before the race. I won it and became an &#x27;A&#x27; rider. Then I could start the year in the Tour of Flanders. I was 19 and I&#x27;ll probably stay the youngest person ever to win.&quot; Van Steenbergen was in the break when several riders fell on the cinder track to the track in Ghent. Van Steenbergen rode round the fallen and won. Next year he decided not to ride. Van Wijnendaele was offended. But Van Steenbergen had realised why he&#x27;d turned pro: to make a living. &quot;I could probably win more money elsewhere,&quot; he said. &quot;The Tour of Flanders didn&#x27;t have the attraction that it does now, especially not internationally.&quot;

===1946: Van Steenbergen again===
Van Steenbergen returned in 1946 and won again. He said: &quot;That was one of my best wins ever. I could do whatever I liked, ride better than anyone. In the end I was with Briek Schotte and Enkel Thiétard. They were happy just to follow me. We made an agreement. I said that they could stay with me until we got to Kwatrecht. I wouldn&#x27;t drop them provided they&#x27;d do their best to work with me. They were happy with that. They didn&#x27;t have a choice. Under the bridge at Kwatrecht I just got rid of them.&quot;

===1951: Magni&#x27;s festival===
Fiorenzo Magni, a rare Italian in Belgian classics, won so many intermediate prizes during his long solo flight that they would have bought him a house (see above). He was one of nine to escape the field at Ingelmunster. The others cracked one by one until Magni was alone by Strijpen – the point where he made his winning move the previous year. He rode the last alone to win the Ronde for the third successive year. Magni won by almost eight minutes and the first five finishers were foreigners.

===1961: Simpson vs. Defilippis===
Such a gale blew in 1961 that the banner over the finish line blew down. The British rider Tom Simpson was clear with the better-known Italian champion, Nino Defilippis. Simpson, the weaker sprinter, accelerated for the line with a kilometre to go. It was too far and Defilipis came past him as he weakened. Simpson struggled to stay with him and was delighted when the Italian began freewheeling just before the finish. Defilippis said he didn&#x27;t know where the finish was because the banner had blown down, but the two riders had already covered two previous laps of the finishing circuit. For the same reason, the Italian protest that the line on the road wasn&#x27;t clearly marked also failed. Defilippis asked Simpson to agree to a tie, saying no Italian had won a classic since 1953. Simpson said: 

===1969: Merckx&#x27; panache===
Eddy Merckx dominated world racing in both classics and stage races but couldn&#x27;t win the Ronde. By 1969 he had not only frustration to contend with but rising resentment of other riders unhappy that he won so many races. He attacked early and half the field never saw him again. The other half was reduced with each successive attack until he got clear alone. The chase was furious but ineffective and Merckx won by more than five and a half minutes over Felice Gimondi and more than eight minutes on the rest. The Ronde remained an unhappy race for him; it was another six years before he won again.

===1985: Vanderaerden in the storm===
Bad weather has often hit the &quot;Ronde&quot;. In 1985, a storm broke in the second half of the race. The weather was so bad that only 24 made it to the finish. The race historian, Rik Vanwalleghem, said: &quot;It was a legendary Ronde, one which wrote Sport with a capital S. It was as cold as Siberia all day and the rain fell in torrents &quot;(regende het pijpenstelen)&quot; [...] In this apocalyptic background Eric Vanderaerden got back to the front after looking beaten to ride at the head of the race alone. Impressive.&quot;

===1987: Skibby on the Koppenberg===
The danger of the &quot;Ronde&#x27;s&quot; narrow and badly surfaced hills came close to tragedy when Danish rider Jesper Skibby was hit from behind by an official&#x27;s car and fell onto a roadside bank, still strapped into his pedals. The official&#x27;s car then tried to pass him and ran over Skibby&#x27;s back wheel, narrowly missing his leg. The race official continued to the finish, where he was met by angry spectators throwing mud, cups and stones at his car. The incident overshadowed the victory of Claude Criquielion, the first French-speaking Belgian winner of the Tour of Flanders.

==Opinions==
*&quot;Only those who are in top condition can say that the Ronde is not hard. For everyone else, it&#x27;s the Way of the Cross.&quot; – Andrea Tafi
*&quot;I told the organisers it wasn&#x27;t a race but a war game. It&#x27;s hard to explain what the Koppenberg means to a racing cyclist. Instead of being a race, it&#x27;s a lottery. Only the first five or six riders have any chance: the rest fall off or scramble up as best they can. What on earth have we done to send us to hell now?&quot; – Bernard Hinault
*&quot;&quot;As a Belgian, winning Flanders for the first time is far more important than wearing the maillot jaune [&quot;yellow jersey&quot;] in the Tour&quot; – Johan Museeuw
*&quot;Looking back, you get a bit nostalgic, but from a competitive point of view, Flanders was one of the most horrible races to ride but one of the greatest races to win.&quot;&quot; – Sean Kelly
*&quot;Many great names of Flemish cycling live on the route of the race. This closeness doesn&#x27;t exist in any other country. That&#x27;s what gives our identity.&quot; – Nico Mattan
*&quot;These days, you see all the riders, their life is well known. Before, you saw only the last two hours on television. Now, the direct coverage starts before the race has started and the legend that surrounded riders, created in people&#x27;s imagination, no longer exists. When everything is too realistic, you lose the legend.&quot; – Marc Sergeant
*&quot;The Tour of Flanders is unlike any other bike race in the world. It is, without question, the hardest one-day bike race ever created. What seems like a million corners, combined with twenty to thirty steep pitches and narrow roads, none of which go the same direction for more than a mile, all mix together to make it war on a bike. There isn’t a race in North America that compares. Flanders may as well be a different sport.&quot; – George Hincapie

==Tour of Flanders for Women==

Since 2004 there is a women&#x27;s Tour of Flanders (), held every spring on the same day as the men&#x27;s race. It is part of the UCI Women&#x27;s World Tour and is considered one of the most prestigious events in women cycling.

From 2004 to 2011 the race ran over a course which started in Oudenaarde and finished in Meerbeke, with the last identical to the men&#x27;s race. Since 2012 the race starts and finishes in Oudenaarde. It is and has a similar finale as the men&#x27;s Tour of Flanders, with many of the same hills, except for the Koppenberg. In 2018 the race features 12 climbs, including the Muur van Geraardsbergen, Oude Kwaremont, Paterberg and three long flat cobbled sectors. The final , including Kruisberg, Oude Kwaremont and Paterberg, are identical to the men&#x27;s finale.

Dutch rider Mirjam Melchers-Van Poppel and Germany&#x27;s Judith Arndt currently hold the record with two wins.

==Legacy and impact==

The history of the Tour of Flanders is celebrated at the &quot;Centrum Ronde van Vlaanderen&quot; (Tour of Flanders Center), an interactive cycling-themed experience center and museum in Oudenaarde. It opened in 2003 with an extensive array of audiovisual material from old television and radio broadcasts. Visitors are able to experience a ride on a cobbled road or experience the Kwaremont climb, in a virtual contest with stars like Peter Van Petegem.

The center&#x27;s founder and director is former sports journalist and writer Rik Van Walleghem; the museum curator is 1970s cycling icon Freddy Maertens, who provides guided tours.

The center is located on Oudenaarde&#x27;s city square, close to the finish of the Tour of Flanders which relocated to Oudenaarde in 2012. There is also a &quot;brasserie&quot; and a museum shop.

Since 1999, fans are also able to participate in the amateur Tour of Flanders Cyclosportive, called &quot;We Ride Flanders&quot;, organized on the Saturday before the professional events. The longest route is , starting in Bruges, but there are three shorter routes, of , or , which all start and finish in Oudenaarde. Because of its growing success, the number of participants has been restricted to 16,000 in order to secure riders&#x27; safety on the roads. Tickets are usually sold out months before the race. 60% of participants are non-Belgians.

<text>David George Ritchie (26 October 1853 — 3 February 1903) was a Scottish philosopher who had a distinguished university career at Edinburgh, and Balliol College, Oxford, and after being fellow of Jesus College and a tutor at Balliol College was elected professor of logic and metaphysics at St Andrews. He was also the third president of the Aristotelian Society in 1898.

==Life==

Ritchie was born at Jedburgh on 26 October 1853. He was the only son of the three children of Very Rev Dr George Ritchie, D.D., minister of the parish and a man of scholarship and culture, who was elected to the office of Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1870. His mother was Elizabeth Bradfute Dudgeon. The family was connected with the Carlyles, and early in 1889 Ritchie edited a volume of &quot;Early Letters of Jane Welsh Carlyle.&quot;

Ritchie received his early schooling at Jedburgh Academy. Not allowed to make friends with other boys of his own age, he never learned to play games, and lived a solitary life, concentrating his mind on purely intellectual subjects. He matriculated in 1869 at the University of Edinburgh, where he made a special study of classics under Professors William Young Sellar and J. S. Blackie, while he began to study philosophy under Professor Campbell Fraser, in whose class and in that of Professor Henry Calderwood (on moral philosophy) he gained the highest prizes. After graduating M.A. at Edinburgh in 1875 with first-class honours in classics, Ritchie gained a classical exhibition at Balliol College, Oxford, and won a first-class both in classical moderations (Michaelmas, 1875) and in the final classical school (Trinity term, 1878). In 1878 he became a fellow of Jesus College, Oxford and in 1881 a tutor. From 1882 to 1886 he was also a tutor at Balliol College. At Oxford Ritchie came under the influence of Thomas Hill Green and Arnold Toynbee, and it was there that the foundations were laid both for his interest in idealistic philosophy associated with the name of G. W. F. Hegel (see British idealism), and also of his strong bent toward practical politics; his political philosophy was dominated by the belief that practical action must be derived from principles.

Ritchie married twice. His first marriage was in 1881 to Flora Lindsay, daughter of Col. A. A. Macdonell of Lochgarry, and sister of Professor A. A. Macdonell of Oxford. Flora died in 1888. He was married a second time in 1889 to Ellen Haycraft, sister of Professor John Berry Haycraft. He had a daughter by the first marriage and a son, Arthur David Ritchie, by the second.

In 1894 Ritchie left Oxford on being appointed professor of logic and metaphysics at the University of St. Andrews. At this time the university was in the midst of a turmoil of conflicting interests which involved litigation and much partisan feeling. In this conflict Ritchie supported the side of progress, which ultimately prevailed. 

Ritchie was a founding member, and the third President (1898–1899), of the Aristotelian Society, an influential academic organisation that is still very much in active existence.

He remained at St. Andrews until his death on 3 February 1903. He is buried in the north-east corner of the Eastern Cemetery in St Andrews beneath a large black granite cross.

==Philosophy==
Both at Oxford and at St. Andrews, Ritchie wrote mostly on ethics and political philosophy. One of his earliest writings was an essay on &quot;The Rationality of History,&quot; contributed to &quot;Essays in Philosophical Criticism,&quot; written in 1883 by a number of young men influenced by Hegel and his interpreters. He was very much one of the generation of thinkers who were sometimes referred to as the British Idealists.

Of a simple and unaffected nature, Ritchie pursued the truth he set himself to seek with an entire devotion. Despite his retiring manner, he had many friends. He held strongly that questions of ethics and politics must be regarded from a metaphysical point of view. For him the foundation of ethics necessarily rested on the ideal end of social well-being, and keeping this end in view, he proceeded to trace its history at different times, the manner in which it shapes itself in the mind of each individual, and the way in which it can be developed and realised. Ritchie was an advanced liberal with socialist leanings. He considered that the ultimate value of religion depended on the ideal it set before mankind when it represented its highest form.

==Criticism of animal rights==

Ritchie was an early critic of animal rights. He disagreed with Henry Stephens Salt&#x27;s views and authored the paper &quot;The Rights of Animals&quot; for the &quot;International Journal of Ethics&quot;, in 1900. His paper &quot;Why Animals Do Not Have Rights&quot; was reprinted in 1976.

In his book &quot;Natural Rights&quot;, Ritchie stated that although &quot;we may be said to have duties of kindness towards the animals, it is incorrect to represent these as strictly duties towards the animals themselves, as if they had rights against us.&quot; Ritchie argued that there would be absurd consequences if animals have rights, such as cats eating mice which would violate their rights.

<text>The thinking processes in Eliyahu M. Goldratt&#x27;s theory of constraints are the five methods to enable the focused improvement of any cognitive system (especially business systems).

==Purpose==
The purpose of the thinking processes is to help answer questions essential to achieving focused improvement: 
# &quot;What to change?&quot;
# &quot;What to change it into?&quot;
# &quot;How to cause the change?&quot;

Sometimes two other questions are considered as well:

and:
A more thorough rationale is presented in &quot;What is this thing called theory of constraints and how should it be implemented&quot;.

A more thorough work, mapping the use and evolution of the Thinking Processes, was conducted by Victoria Mabin et al.

==Processes==
The primary thinking processes, as codified by Goldratt and others:
* Current reality tree (CRT, similar to the current state map used by many organizations) — evaluates the network of cause-effect relations between the undesirable effects (UDE&#x27;s, also known as gap elements) and helps to pinpoint the root cause(s) of most of the undesirable effects.
* Evaporating cloud (conflict resolution diagram or CRD) - solves conflicts that usually perpetuate the causes for an undesirable situation.
* Core conflict cloud (CCC) - A combination of conflict clouds based on several UDE&#x27;s. Looking for deeper conflicts that create the undesirable effects.
* Future reality tree (FRT, similar to a future state map) - Once some actions (injections) are chosen (not necessarily detailed) to solve the root cause(s) uncovered in the CRT and to resolve the conflict in the CRD the FRT shows the future states of the system and helps to identify possible negative outcomes of the changes (Negative Branches) and to prune them before implementing the changes.
* Negative branch reservations (NBR) - Identify potential negative ramifications of any action (such as an injection, or a half-baked idea). The goal of the NBR is to understand the causal path between the action and negative ramifications so that the negative effect can be &quot;trimmed.&quot;
* Positive reinforcement loop (PRL) - Desired effect (DE) presented in FRT amplifies intermediate objective (IO) that is earlier (lower) in the tree. While intermediate objective is strengthened it positively affects this DE. Finding out PRLs makes FRT more sustaining.
* Prerequisite tree (PRT) - states that all of the intermediate objectives necessary to carry out an action chosen and the obstacles that will be overcome in the process.
* Transition tree (TT) - describes in great detail the action that will lead to the fulfillment of a plan to implement changes (outlined on a PRT or not).
* Strategy &amp; tactics (S&amp;T) - the overall project plan and metrics that will lead to a successful implementation and the ongoing loop through POOGI. Goldratt adapted three operating level performance measures—throughput, inventory and operating expense—and adopted three strategic performance measures—net income, return on investment, and cash flow—to maintain the change.

Some observers note that these processes are not fundamentally very different from some other management change models such as PDCA &quot;plan–do–check–act&quot; (aka &quot;plan–do–study–act&quot;) or &quot;survey–assess–decide–implement–evaluate&quot;, but the way they can be used is clearer and more straightforward.

<doc id="206365" wikidata="Q2211650" url="?curid=206365" title="Sadomasochism">
<text>Sadism () and masochism (), known collectively as sadomasochism ( ) or S&amp;M, is the derivation of pleasure from acts of respectively inflicting or receiving pain or humiliation. The term is named after the Marquis de Sade, a French author known for his violent and libertine works and lifestyle, and Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, an Austrian author who described masochistic tendencies in his works. Though sadomasochistic behaviours and desires do not necessarily need to be linked to sex, sadomasochism is also a definitive feature of consensual BDSM relationships. 

== Etymology and definition ==

The word &quot;sadomasochism&quot; is a portmanteau of the words and . These terms originate from the names of two authors whose works explored situations in which individuals experienced or inflicted pain or humiliation. &quot;Sadism&quot; is named after Marquis de Sade (1740–1814), whose major works include graphic descriptions of violent sex acts, rape, torture, and murder, and whose characters often derive pleasure from inflicting pain on others. Sade was imprisoned multiple times for sexual crimes following affairs in which he inflicted and/or received pain during sex, hence engaging in sadomasochism himself. &quot;Masochism&quot; is named after Leopold von Sacher-Masoch (1836–1895), whose novels explored his masochistic fantasies of receiving pain and degradation, particularly his novel &quot;Venus im Pelz&quot; (&quot;Venus in Furs&quot;).German psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing (1840-1902) introduced the terms &quot;sadism&quot; and &quot;masochism&quot; into clinical use in his work &quot;Neue Forschungen auf dem Gebiet der Psychopathia sexualis&quot; (&quot;New research in the area of Psychopathology of Sex&quot;) in 1890. The terms were first selected for identifying human behavioral phenomena and for the classification of psychological illnesses or deviant behavior. 
In 1905, Sigmund Freud described sadism and masochism in his &quot;Drei Abhandlungen zur Sexualtheorie&quot; (&quot;Three Papers on Sexual Theory&quot;) as stemming from aberrant psychological development from early childhood. He also laid the groundwork for the widely accepted medical perspective in the following decades. This led to the first compound usage of the terminology in &quot;Sado-Masochism&quot; (Loureiroian &quot;Sado-Masochismus&quot;) by the Viennese psychoanalyst Isidor Isaak Sadger in his work &quot;Über den sado-masochistischen Komplex&quot; (&quot;Regarding the sadomasochistic complex&quot;) in 1913.

In the later 20th century, BDSM activists protested against these ideas, because, they argued, they were based on the philosophies of the two psychiatrists, Freud and Krafft-Ebing, whose theories were built on the assumption of psychopathology and their observations of psychiatric patients. 

Nomenclature in previous editions of the DSM referring to sexual psychopathology have been criticized as lacking scientific veracity. The DSM-V, however, has depathologized the language around paraphilias in a way that signifies &quot;the APA&#x27;s intent to not demand treatment for healthy consenting adult sexual expression&quot;. 

== Psychoanalytical perspectives ==
=== Ancient cultures ===
Sadomasochism has been practiced since ancient times with some scholars suggesting that it is an integral part of human culture. Some propose that it was already present among non-human primate and primitive human communities before emerging in ancient cultures. One of the oldest surviving narratives citing its practice is an Egyptian love song, sung by a man expressing a desire to be subjugated by a woman so he could experience pleasure as she treats him like a slave. Roman historian Juvenal described a case of a woman who submitted herself to the whipping and beating of the followers of Pan. 

=== Early psychoanalysis ===

==== Libertine movement ====
Early libertine writers like John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester espoused ideals that modern times are associated with sadomasochism.

==== Krafft-Ebbing and Freud ====
The modern conceptualization of sadomasochism was introduced to the medical field by German psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing in his 1886 compilation of case studies &quot;Psychopathia Sexualis&quot;. Pain and physical violence are not essential in Krafft-Ebing&#x27;s conception, and he defined &quot;masochism&quot; (German &quot;Masochismus&quot;) entirely in terms of control. Sigmund Freud, a psychoanalyst and a contemporary of Krafft-Ebing, noted that both were often found in the same individuals, and combined the two into a single dichotomous entity known as &quot;sadomasochism&quot;. French philosopher Gilles Deleuze argued that the concurrence of sadism and masochism proposed in Freud&#x27;s model is the result of &quot;careless reasoning,&quot; and should not be taken for granted.

Freud introduced the terms &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; masochism. Though this idea has come under a number of interpretations, in a primary masochism the masochist undergoes a complete, rather than partial, rejection by the model or courted object (or sadist), possibly involving the model taking a rival as a preferred mate. This complete rejection is related to the death drive (&quot;Todestrieb&quot;) in Freud&#x27;s psychoanalysis. In a secondary masochism, by contrast, the masochist experiences a less serious, more feigned rejection and punishment by the model.

Both Krafft-Ebing and Freud assumed that sadism in men resulted from the distortion of the aggressive component of the male sexual instinct. Masochism in men, however, was seen as a more significant aberration, contrary to the nature of male sexuality. Freud doubted that masochism in men was ever a primary tendency, and speculated that it may exist only as a transformation of sadism. Sadomasochism in women received comparatively little discussion, as it was believed that it occurred primarily in men. Krafft-Ebing and Freud also assumed that masochism was so inherent to female sexuality that it would be difficult to distinguish as a separate inclination.

==== Havelock Ellis ====
Havelock Ellis, in &quot;Studies in the Psychology of Sex&quot;, argued that there is no clear distinction between the aspects of sadism and masochism, and that they may be regarded as complementary emotional states. He states that sadomasochism is concerned only with pain in regard to sexual pleasure, and not in regard to cruelty, as Freud had suggested. He believed the sadomasochist generally desires that the pain and violence be inflicted or received in love, not in abuse, for the pleasure of either one or both participants. This mutual pleasure may be essential for the satisfaction of those involved.

==== Jean-Paul Sartre ====
Jean-Paul Sartre linked the pleasure or power experienced by a sadist in appraising the masochist victim to his philosophy of the &quot;Look of the Other&quot;. Sartre argued that masochism is an attempt by the &quot;For-itself&quot; (consciousness) to reduce itself to nothing, becoming an object that is drowned out by the &quot;abyss of the Other&#x27;s subjectivity&quot;. Given that the &quot;For-itself&quot; desires to attain a point of view in which it is both subject and object, one strategy is to gather and intensify every feeling and posture in which the self appears as an object to be rejected, tested, and humiliated; in this way, the For-itself strives toward a point of view in which there is only one subjectivity in the relationship, being both that of the abuser and the abused. Conversely, Sartre held sadism to be the effort to annihilate the subjectivity of the victim, meaning the sadist is exhilarated by the emotional distress of the victim because they seek a subjectivity that views the victim as both subject and object.

==== Gilles Deleuze ====
In his 1967 essay &quot;Coldness and Cruelty&quot; (originally French &quot;Présentation de Sacher-Masoch&quot;), Gilles Deleuze rejects the term &quot;sadomasochism&quot; as artificial, especially in the context of Sacher-Masoch&#x27;s &quot;Venus In Furs&quot;. Deleuze&#x27;s counterargument is that the tendency toward masochism is based on intensified desire brought on or enhanced by the acting out of frustration at the delay of gratification. Taken to its extreme, an intolerably indefinite delay is &#x27;rewarded&#x27; by punitive perpetual delay, manifested as unwavering coldness. The masochist derives pleasure from, as Deleuze puts it, the &quot;Contract&quot;: the process by which he can control another individual and turn the individual into someone cold and callous. The sadist, in contrast, derives pleasure from the &quot;Law&quot;: the unavoidable power that places one person below another. The sadist attempts to destroy the ego in an effort to unify the Freudian id and super-ego, gratifying the most base desires the sadist can express while ignoring or completely suppressing the will of the ego or conscience. Thus, Deleuze attempts to argue that masochism and sadism arise from such different impulses that the combination of the two terms is meaningless and misleading. A masochist&#x27;s perception of their own self-subjugating sadistic desires and capacities are treated by Deleuze as reactions to prior experience of sadistic objectification. The epilogue of &quot;Venus In Furs&quot; shows the character of Severin has become embittered by his experiment in the alleged control of masochism, and advocates instead the domination of women.

==== René Girard ====
René Girard included his account of sadomasochism in &quot;Things Hidden Since the Foundation of The World (&quot;1978), placing masochism as a coherent part of his theory of mimetic desire. In this view of sadomasochism, the violence involved is an expression of a peripheral rivalry that has developed around the actual love-object.

Rejection is not desired by a primary masochist in the same way feigned rejection occurring within a mutually consensual sadomasochistic relationship is, or during instances where the masochist is the one having actual initiative power. In &quot;Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World&quot;, René Girard attempts to resuscitate and reinterpret Freud&#x27;s distinction of primary and secondary masochism, in connection with his own philosophy.

=== Modern understanding ===

People find sexual sadomasochism pleasurable for reasons dependent on the individual. For some masochists, taking on a role of compliance or helplessness offers an escape from the stresses of life, responsibility, or guilt. For others, being under the power of a strong, controlling presence may evoke the feelings of safety and protection associated with childhood. Others may derive satisfaction from earning the approval of a controlling figure. A sadist may enjoy the feeling of power and authority that comes from performing a dominant role or from receiving pleasure vicariously through the suffering of the masochist.

Sexual sadomasochistic desires can appear at any age. Some individuals report having had them before puberty, while others do not discover them until well into adulthood. According to a 1985 study, the majority of male sadomasochists (53%) developed their interest before the age of 15, while the majority of females (78%) developed their interest afterwards. The prevalence of sadomasochism within the general population is unknown. Despite female sadists being less visible than males, some surveys have resulted in comparable amounts of sadistic fantasies between females and males. The results of such studies indicate that one&#x27;s sex may not be the determining factor for a preference towards sadism.

In contrast to frameworks seeking to explain and categorise sadomasochistic behaviours and desires through psychological, psychoanalytic, medical, or forensic approaches, Romana Byrne suggests that, in the context of sexual behaviours, such practices can be seen as examples of &quot;aesthetic sexuality&quot;, in which a founding physiological or psychological impulse is irrelevant. Rather, according to Byrne, sadism and masochism may be practiced through choice and deliberation, driven by certain aesthetic goals tied to style, pleasure, and identity, which in certain circumstances, she claims can be compared with the creation of art.

Surveys from the 2000s on the spread of sadomasochistic fantasies and practices show strong variations in the range of their results. Nonetheless, researchers assumed that 5 to 25 percent of the population practices sexual behavior related to pain or dominance and submission. The population with related fantasies is believed to be even larger.

Interest in sexual sadomasochism in the 2020s is thought to have increased with the prevalence of easily accessible hardcore pornography and a decrease in social taboo surrounding the subject.

== Medical and forensic classification ==
In 1995, Denmark became the first European Union country to have completely removed sadomasochism from its national classification of diseases. This was followed by Sweden in 2009, Norway in 2010, Finland in 2011 and Iceland in 2015.

=== DSM ===
Medical opinion of sadomasochistic activities has changed over time. The classification of sadism and masochism in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) has always been separate; sadism was included in the DSM-I in 1952, while masochism was added in the DSM-II in 1968. Contemporary psychology continues to identify sadism and masochism separately, and categorizes them as either practised as a lifestyle, or as a medical condition.

The current version of the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s manual, DSM-5, excludes consensual BDSM from diagnosis as a disorder when the sexual interests cause no harm or distress.

Sexual sadism disorder however, listed within the DSM-5, is where arousal patterns involving consenting and non‐consenting others are not distinguished.

=== ICD ===
On 18 June 2018, the WHO (World Health Organization) published ICD-11, in which sadomasochism, together with fetishism and fetishistic transvestism (cross-dressing for sexual pleasure) were removed as psychiatric diagnoses. Moreover, discrimination against fetish-having and BDSM individuals is considered inconsistent with human rights principles endorsed by the United Nations and The World Health Organization.

The classifications of sexual disorders reflect contemporary sexual norms and have moved from a model of pathologization or criminalization of non-reproductive sexual behaviors to a model that reflects sexual well-being and pathologizes the absence or limitation of consent in sexual relations.

The ICD-11 classification, contrary to ICD-10 and DSM-5, clearly distinguishes consensual sadomasochistic behaviours (BDSM) that do not involve inherent harm to self or others from harmful violence on non‐consenting persons (coercive sexual sadism disorder). In this regard, &quot;ICD-11 go[es] further than the changes made for DSM-5 … in the removal of disorders diagnosed based on consenting behaviors that are not in and of themselves associated with distress or functional impairment.&quot;

In Europe, an organization called ReviseF65 worked to remove sadomasochism from the ICD. On commission from the WHO ICD-11 Working Group on Sexual Disorders and Sexual Health, ReviseF65 in 2009 and 2011 delivered reports documenting that sadomasochism and sexual violence are two different phenomena. The report concluded that the sadomasochism diagnosis was outdated, non-scientific, and stigmatizing.

The ICD-11 classification considers Sadomasochism as a variant in sexual arousal and private behavior without appreciable public health impact and for which treatment is neither indicated nor sought. Further, the ICD-11 guidelines &quot;respect the rights of individuals whose atypical sexual behavior is consensual and not harmful.&quot; WHO&#x27;s ICD-11 Working Group admitted that psychiatric diagnoses have been used to harass, silence, or imprison sadomasochists. Labeling as such may create harm, convey social judgment, and exacerbate existing stigma and violence to individuals so labeled. According to ICD-11, psychiatric diagnoses can no longer be used to discriminate against BDSM people and fetishists.

Based on advances in research and clinical practice, and major shifts in social attitudes and in relevant policies, laws, and human rights standards&quot;, the World Health Organization, on June 18, 2018, removed Fetishism, Transvestic Fetishism, and Sadomasochism as psychiatric diagnoses.

=== Forensic classification ===
According to Anil Aggrawal, in forensic science, levels of sexual sadism and masochism are classified as follows:

Sexual masochists:
* &quot;Class I&quot;: Bothered by, but not seeking out, fantasies. May be preponderantly sadists with minimal masochistic tendencies or non-sadomasochistic with minimal masochistic tendencies
* &quot;Class II&quot;: Equal mix of sadistic and masochistic tendencies. Like to receive pain but also like to be dominant partner (in this case, sadists). Sexual orgasm is achieved without pain or humiliation.
* &quot;Class III&quot;: Masochists with minimal to no sadistic tendencies. Preference for pain or humiliation (which facilitates orgasm), but not necessary to orgasm. Capable of romantic attachment.
* &quot;Class IV&quot;: Exclusive masochists (i.e. cannot form typical romantic relationships, cannot achieve orgasm without pain or humiliation).

Sexual sadists:
* &quot;Class I&quot;: Bothered by sexual fantasies but do not act on them.
* &quot;Class II&quot;: Act on sadistic urges with consenting sexual partners (masochists or otherwise). Categorization as leptosadism is outdated.
* &quot;Class III&quot;: Act on sadistic urges with non-consenting victims, but do not seriously injure or kill. May coincide with sadistic rapists.
* &quot;Class IV&quot;: Only act with non-consenting victims and will seriously injure or kill them.

The difference between I–II and III–IV is consent.

== Role in BDSM ==

Sadomasochism is a subset of BDSM, a variety of erotic practices including bondage, discipline, dominance, and submission. Sadomasochism is not diagnosed as a paraphilia unless such practices lead to clinically significant distress or impairment for the individual. Sadomasochism performed within the context of mutual and informed consent is distinguished from non-consensual acts of sexual violence or aggression. Individuals may identify as and partake in the sadistic, masochistic, or &quot;switch&quot; (performing both or changing) role.

There have been occasions where the law has focused on the violent aspects of sadomasochistic behaviour while neglecting consensual sexual practices, such as during a case in England where 15 men were tried for a range of offences relating to sadomasochism. (&quot;See also: Legality of BDSM)&quot;

Larry Townsend&#x27;s 1983 edition of &quot;The Leatherman&#x27;s Handbook II&quot; states that a black handkerchief is a symbol for sadomasochism in the handkerchief code, a code employed usually among gay male casual-sex seekers or BDSM practitioners in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe. Wearing the handkerchief on the left indicates the top, dominant, or active partner; right indicates the bottom, submissive, or passive partner. Negotiation with a prospective partner remains important as people may wear hankies of any color &quot;only because the idea of the hankie turns them on&quot; or they &quot;may not even know what it means&quot;.

<text>Eric Philbrook Kelly (March 16, 1884 – January 3, 1960) was an American journalist, academic and author of children&#x27;s books. He was a professor of English at Dartmouth College and briefly a lecturer at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. He won the 1929 Newbery Medal recognizing his first published book, &quot;The Trumpeter of Krakow&quot;, as the preceding year&#x27;s most distinguished contribution to American children&#x27;s literature.

==Life==
Kelly was born in 1884 in Amesbury, Massachusetts. Kelly graduated Dartmouth College in 1906 (BA). As a student, Kelly was a member of the French club and one of the first members of The Pukwana Club, which would eventually transition into the Delta Beta chapter of the Sigma Nu fraternity.

After &quot;ten colorless, uneventful, and discouraging years working on newspapers&quot;, Kelly volunteered in 1918 to work with the welfare organisation Les Foyers du Soldat in Quentin, France. He found himself in charge of athletics and entertainment for 2,000 Polish soldiers in Haller&#x27;s Army. In May 1919, Kelly was shipped across Germany to the newly recognised state of Poland in a closed boxcar along with the Polish troops. His new base was established in the old Napoleonic fortress of Modlin, near Warsaw. He wrote to his mother that &quot;Warsaw is a beautiful city, reminds me in some ways of Denver.&quot;

During the 1919–1920 Polish–Soviet War, Kelly was posted at Chełm with Haller&#x27;s Army on the Bug River. In January 1921, Kelly returned to the US where he took a job as a teacher at Mercersburg Academy. During this period he wrote descriptions of his experience in Poland and warned against the dangers of Bolshevik propaganda. Six months later, he was hired by his alma mater, Dartmouth College, where he would teach for 33 years. In 1924, he married his wife Katherine but, in spite of his fame as a children’s author, did not have any children of his own.

1925–1926 Kelly went to the Jagiellonian University in Kraków as the first American exchange scholar sent to Poland by the Kosciuszko Foundation. Kelly served as an instructor of American Literature and Institutions in the Department of English Philology under Prof. Roman Dybowski.

On 4 July 1926, Kelly ceremonially placed a vase filled with earth from Tadeusz Kościuszko&#x27;s North American battlefields at Yorktown and Saratoga in the Kościuszko Mound overlooking Kraków. That same year, he started work on &quot;The Trumpeter of Krakow&quot; which won the Newbery Medal for Children&#x27;s literature in 1929. This novel contains the first known reference in any language to the now-popular legend of the hejnał trumpeter shot by a Tartar arrow.

Kelly spent 1930 as a researcher in Vilnius and 1931 in Lviv (both in Polish hands at that time). These inspired further Polish-themed children’s books: &quot;The Blacksmith of Vilno&quot; and &quot;The Golden Star of Halicz&quot;. His 1932 book, &quot;The Christmas Nightingale&quot;, was adapted as a play in 1935.

In 1943–1945, Kelly worked for the US State Department taking care of Polish refugees in León, Guanajuato, Mexico.

Kelly was chairman of the Pulitzer Prize selection committee for the novel in the years 1951, 1952 and 1953. He retired from teaching in 1954, and retired to Chebeague Island, Maine, and Ojo Caliente, New Mexico.

<text>Henry Longueville Mansel (6 October 1820 – 30 July 1871) was an English philosopher and ecclesiastic.

==Life==
He was born at Cosgrove, Northamptonshire (where his father, also Henry Longueville Mansel, fourth son of General John Mansel, was rector). He was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, London and St John&#x27;s College, Oxford. He took a double first in 1843, and became tutor of his college. He was appointed reader in moral and metaphysical philosophy at Magdalen College in 1855, and Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy in 1859. He was a great opponent of university reform and of the Hegelianism which was then beginning to take root in Oxford. In 1867 he succeeded Arthur Penrhyn Stanley as regius professor of ecclesiastical history, and in 1868 he was appointed dean of St Paul&#x27;s. He died in Cosgrove on the first of July 1871.

==Work==
The philosophy of Mansel, like that of Sir William Hamilton, was mainly due to Aristotle, Immanuel Kant and Thomas Reid. Like Hamilton, Mansel maintained the purely formal character of logic, the duality of consciousness as testifying to both self and the external world, and the limitation of knowledge to the finite and &quot;conditioned.&quot; His doctrines were developed in his edition of Aldrich&#x27;s &quot;Artis logicae rudimenta&quot; (1849) – his chief contribution to the reviving study of Aristotle – and in his &quot;Prolegomena logica: an Inquiry into the Psychological Character of Logical Processes&quot; (1851, 2nd ed. enlarged 1860), in which the limits of logic as the &quot;science of formal thinking&quot; are rigorously determined.

In his Bampton lectures on &quot;The Limits of Religious Thought&quot; (1858, 5th ed. 1867; Danish trans. 1888) he applied to Christian theology the metaphysical agnosticism which seemed to result from Kant&#x27;s criticism, and which had been developed in Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy of the Unconditioned&quot;. While denying all knowledge of the supersensuous, Mansel deviated from Kant in contending that cognition of the ego as it really belongs among the facts of experience. Consciousness, he held – agreeing thus with the doctrine of &quot;natural realism&quot; which Hamilton developed from Reid – implies knowledge both of self and of the external world. The latter Mansel&#x27;s psychology reduces to consciousness of our organism as extended; with the former is given consciousness of free will and moral obligation.
These lectures led Mansel to a bitter controversy with the Christian socialist theologian Frederick Maurice.

A summary of Mansel&#x27;s philosophy is contained in his article &quot;Metaphysics&quot; in the 5th edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (1860). He also wrote
*&quot;Metaphysics or the Philosophy of Consciousness Phenomenal and Real&quot; (4th ed., 1883), 408pps, Edinburgh, Adam and Charles Black
*&quot;The Philosophy of the Conditioned&quot; (1866) in reply to John Stuart Mill&#x27;s criticism of Hamilton;
* &quot;Letters, Lectures, and Reviews&quot; (ed. Chandler, 1873),
*&quot;The Gnostic Heresies of the First and Second Centuries&quot; (ed. Joseph Barber Lightfoot, 1875, with a biographical sketch by Lord Carnarvon).

He contributed a commentary on the first two gospels to the &quot;Speaker&#x27;s Commentary&quot; (1881).

Mansel&#x27;s mother, Maria, was the daughter of Admiral Sir Robert Moorsom.

<text>Focused improvement in the theory of constraints is an ensemble of activities aimed at elevating the performance of any system, especially a business system, with respect to its goal by eliminating its constraints one by one and by &quot;not&quot; working on non-constraints.

Focused improvement can also be defined in simpler terms as a process that identifies the systems problems and then modifies the whole system in order to find the most cost effective, time saving and least disruptive solutions in order to optimize the system.

&quot;Focused Improvement is the process of applying systematic problem solving methods to manufacturing. The process relies on aligning the correct method to the correct scenario&quot;.

== Development and Apparition ==
Focused improvement was developed as a working part of the Theory of Constraints management philosophy by Eliyahu M. Goldratt in his 1984 book titled &quot;The Goal&quot;, that is geared to help organizations continually achieve their goals. Unlike other popular performance improvement methods, such as TQM or reengineering, F.I. focuses on solving real life problems and not on increasing the costs and distractions for the management&#x27;s attention.

== Focused improvement V.S. Total Quality Management (TQM) ==
No general agreement has been reached about the characteristics of F.I. or TQM but to some extent we can observe similar traits in implementations of these processes.

=== Traits of Focused improvement ===
# Identify the system&#x27;s constraint(s).
# Decide how to exploit the system&#x27;s constraint(s).
# Subordinate everything else to the above decision(s).
# Elevate the system&#x27;s constraint(s). 
# Communicate the new approach and move to the next improvement

=== Traits of TQM ===
# &quot;Quality is defined by customers&#x27; requirements.&quot;
# &quot;Top management has direct responsibility for quality improvement.&quot;
# &quot;Increased quality comes from systematic analysis and improvement of work processes.&quot;
# &quot;Quality improvement is a continuous effort and conducted throughout the organization.&quot; 
These two philosophies have the same main goal but they go about achieving it two different ways. The FI delivers short term results that can be translated into long term success if the process is repeated correctly without allowing it to lose momentum. The TQM has at its base client satisfaction but it only yields long term results. When choosing one of these two processes management has to take into account what are the company needs.

== Uses and potential ==
Products that are based on embedded computer systems has seen a rapid increase. During this time the features that are controlled or supported by software systems that are embedded have suffered an increase in their role becoming crucial. All these developments make it necessary to create and innovate new approaches for software process improvement that focus on improving specific product traits.

Focused improvement can be used not only in business systems but in any type of system be it healthcare, education, waste management, space exploration systems (NASA, etc.).

== Functioning principles ==
The FI is based on the Five Thinking Processes that enable it to work in any cognitive system. The working principle of the five thinking processes is represented by the users ability to answer the following questions:
# &quot;What to change?&quot;
# &quot;What to change it into?&quot;
# &quot;How to cause the change?&quot;
# &quot;Why Change?&quot;
# &quot;How to maintain the process of ongoing improvement ?&quot;
If all questions have an answer then the Focused improvement can be applied with relative ease

== Useful quotes ==

Source:

&quot;Focused improvement includes all activities that maximize the overall effectiveness of equipment, processes, and plants through uncompromising elimination of losses* and improvement of performance.&quot;

The objective of Focused Improvement is to assure that the equipment maintains a peak performance all the time.

&quot;The fact is machines do virtually 100 percent of the product manufacturing work. The only thing we people do, whether we’re operators, technicians, engineers, or managers, is to tend to the needs of the machines in one way or another. The better our machines run, the more productive our shop floor, and the more successful our business.&quot;

The driving concept behind Focused Improvement is bringing your losses as close to zero as possible.

&quot;Maximizing equipment effectiveness requires the complete elimination of failures, defects, and other negative phenomena – in other words, the wastes and losses incurred in equipment operation.&quot;

<text>Cantopop (a contraction of &quot;Cantonese pop music&quot;) is a genre of pop music sung in Cantonese. Cantopop is also used to refer to the cultural context of its production and consumption. The genre began in the 1970s and became associated with Hong Kong popular music from the middle of the decade. Cantopop then reached its height of popularity in the 1980s and 1990s before slowly declining in the 2000s and shrinking in the 2010s. The term &quot;Cantopop&quot; itself was coined in 1978 after &quot;Cantorock&quot;, a term first used in 1974. In the 1980s, Cantopop reached its highest glory with fanbase and concerts all over the world, especially in Macau, Mainland China, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, and Japan. This was even more obvious with the influx of songs from Hong Kong movies during the time.

Besides Western pop music, Cantopop is also influenced by other international genres, including jazz, rock and roll, R&amp;B, disco, electronic, ballad and others. Cantopop songs are almost invariably performed in Cantonese. Boasting a multi-national fanbase, the genre has gained popularity in countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Additionally, it has found following in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi in southeastern mainland China. Hong Kong remains as the significant hub of the genre.

==History==
===1920s to 1950s: Shanghai origins===
Western-influenced music first came to China in the 1920s, specifically through Shanghai. Artists like Zhou Xuan () acted in films and recorded popular songs.

When the People&#x27;s Republic of China was established by the Chinese Communist Party in 1949, one of the first actions taken by the government was to denounce pop music (specifically Western pop) as decadent music. Beginning in the 1950s, massive waves of immigrants fled Shanghai to destinations like North Point in Hong Kong. As a result, many first generation Cantopop artists and composers hail from Shanghai.

===1960s: Cultural acceptance===
By the 1960s, Cantonese music in Hong Kong was still limited largely to traditional Cantonese opera and comic renditions of western music. Tang Kee-chan, Cheng Kuan-min (), and Tam Ping-man () were among the earliest artists releasing Cantonese records.

The generation at the time preferred British and American exports. Western culture was at the time equated with education and sophistication, and Elvis Presley, Johnny Mathis and The Beatles were popular.

Conversely, those who preferred Cantonese music were considered old-fashioned or uneducated. and Chan Chai-chung () were two popular Cantonese singers who specifically targeted the younger generation. Connie Chan Po-chu is generally considered to be Hong Kong&#x27;s first teen idol, mostly due to her career longevity. Josephine Siao is also another artist of the era.

===1970s: Beginning of the Golden Age (Rise of television and the modern industry)===

Local bands mimicked British and American bands. Two types of local Cantonese music appeared in the market nearly concurrently in 1973: one type cashed in on the popularity of TVB&#x27;s drama series based on the more traditional lyrical styles. The other was more western style music largely from Polydor Hong Kong (). Notable singers from the era include Liza Wang and Paula Tsui. At the same time, television was fast becoming a household must-have that offered free entertainment to the public. For example, &quot;The Fatal Irony&quot; () and &quot;Games Gamblers Play&quot; () took the local music scene by storm as soon as they were broadcast on the radio and television.

Soap operas were needed to fill TV air time, and popular Cantonese songs became TV theme songs. Around 1971, Sandra Lang, a minor singer who had never sung Cantopop before, was invited to sing a Cantonese TV theme song &quot;A marriage of Laughter and Tears&quot; (). This song was a collaboration between songwriters Yip Siu-dak () and the legendary Joseph Koo. It was ground-breaking and topped local charts. Other groups that profited from TV promotion included the Four Golden Flowers.

Sam Hui is regarded by some to be the earliest Cantopop star. He was the lead singer of the band Lotus formed in the late 1960s, signed to Polydor in 1972. The song that made him famous was the theme song to &quot;Games Gamblers Play&quot; (), also starring Hui.

The star of TV theme tunes was Roman Tam. Three of the most famous TV soap opera singers were Jenny Tseng, Liza Wang and Adam Cheng. The Wynners and George Lam also amassed a big fan base with their new style. Samuel Hui continued to dominate the charts and won the Centennial Best Sales Award in the first and second IFPI Gold Disc Presentations twice in a row in 1977 and 1978. Polydor became PolyGram () in 1978.

It was at this time that the term &quot;Cantopop&quot; was first coined. The &quot;Billboard&quot; correspondent Hans Ebert, who had earlier coined the term &quot;Cantorock&quot; in 1974, noted a change in its style to something similar to British-American soft rock, therefore started to use the term Cantopop instead in 1978.

In 1974, as the theme song of &quot;The Fatal Irony&quot; () was very successful, TVB sold to the mainland and other countries and Cantopop reached overseas audiences through drama series.

===1980s: The Golden Age of Cantopop===

During the 1980s, Cantopop soared to great heights with artists, producers and record companies working in harmony. Cantopop stars such as Alan Tam, Leslie Cheung, Anita Mui, Sally Yeh, Priscilla Chan, Sandy Lam, Danny Chan, Jacky Cheung, Andy Lau quickly became household names. The industry used Cantopop songs in TV dramas and movies, with some of the biggest soundtracks coming from films such as &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; (). Sponsors and record companies became comfortable with the idea of lucrative contracts and million-dollar signings. There were also Japanese songs with Cantonese lyrics.

The &quot;Queen of Mandarin songs&quot; Teresa Teng also crossed over to Cantopop. She achieved commercial success with her original Cantonese Hits under the Polygram Label in the early 1980s. Jenny Tseng was another notable singers, who was born in Macau.

In the 1980s, there came the second wave of &quot;band fever&quot; (the first wave came in the 1960–70s, which was much influenced by the global Beatlemania at that time. Young people thought that forming bands was fashionable. Many new bands emerged at that time, such as Samuel Hui&#x27;s Lotus, The Wynners, and the Teddy Robin and the Playboys. However, the bands emerged in this first wave were just copying the western music style, mostly covering British and American rock songs, and prefer singing in English rather than Cantonese). Different from the first wave in the 60s, the &quot;band fever&quot; in the 80s did not show an obvious relationship with the global culture at the time being, but much related with the marketing strategy of the local record companies and mass media. Many independent bands and music groups were signed by big record companies, and this made a positive impact to the Hong Kong pop music world, as their works were highly original, with strong individuality, and they were all devoted to writing songs in local language, i.e. Cantonese. The subjects of their works were different from the mainstream (which was mostly love ballads). Politics and social life were popular subjects for the bands in their creation. The &quot;band fever&quot; also brought variety in musical style to the Hong Kong mainstream music world (which was almost monopolised by Pop-ballad for a long time). Styles like Rock, Metal, Pop-Rock, Folk, Neo-Romantic, Pop and some experimental styles (e.g. Cantorock) were introduced. Among them, Beyond and Tat Ming Pair () gave the greatest impact to the Hong Kong music world. Some renowned bands and groups included: Beyond, Raidas, Tat Ming Pair, Tai Chi (), Grasshopper (), Little Tigers (), Paradox (), Blue Jeans (), Echo, Wind &amp; Cloud (), Citybeat ().

The second wave of &quot;band fever&quot; also brought a group of new music lovers to the Hong Kong mainstream music world. Most of them were the just-grew-up generation, or the music lovers of the western Avant-garde music, also the Euro-American Rock-band lovers. This contributed to a great change in the population and age distribution of the music listeners from the 70s. Record companies were laying ever more stress on the buying power of these young new customers. The second wave of &quot;band fever&quot; emerged from the mid-1980s (around 1984) and reached its climax in 1986–87. However the &quot;band fever&quot; cannot put for a long time. Along with the death of the legendary Wong Ka Kui, the leader and co-founder of Beyond, in 1993, and the disband-tide emerged in the early 90s (Tat Ming Pair disbanded in 1990), the &quot;band fever&quot; gradually faded away and totally got down in the early 1990s.

As Cantopop gained large followings in Chinese communities worldwide, Hong Kong entrepreneurs&#x27; ingenious use of the then new Laserdisc technology prompted yet another explosion in the market.

===1990s: Four Heavenly Kings era===
In the 1990s in Hong Kong, the &quot;Four Heavenly Kings&quot; () — Jacky Cheung, Andy Lau, Leon Lai and Aaron Kwok — dominated pop music, and coverage in magazines, TV, advertisements and cinema. They had wide audience across different regions, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, mainland China, Southeast Asia, and even South Korea. The female counterparts in this era were Sammi Cheng, Faye Wong, and Kelly Chen.

The sovereignty handover created a culturally challenging atmosphere for the industry. Establishment of Basic Law and language ordinances made the adoption of Mandarin inevitable.

In 2019, Andy Lau spoke of his desire for a reunion of the Four Heavenly Kings in an interview with the press.

===2000s: New era===
At the turn of the century, Cantonese was still dominant in the domain of Chinese pop. The deaths of superstars Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui in 2003 rocked the industry. In addition, with the Four Heavenly Kings fading out and the rise of Taiwan Mandopop singer-songwriter superstars like Leehom Wang, David Tao, Jay Chou and JJ Lin, influence of Cantopop started declining with fans turning to Taiwan Mandopop in the 2000s.

During the period, a transitional phase also took place with many overseas-raised or overseas-educated artists such as Nicholas Tse and Eason Chan gaining popularity and recognition. In 2006, &quot;Time&quot; magazine praised Eason Chan&#x27;s Cantonese album &quot;U87&quot; as one of the &quot;Five Asian Albums Worth Buying&quot;. Besides holding the record for winning the &quot;Ultimate Male Singer - Gold&quot; award (10 times) and &quot;My Favorite Male Singer&quot; award (9 conservative years) at the &quot;Ultimate Song Chart Awards Presentation&quot; in HK, Eason Chan also won numerous awards at major music award ceremonies locally and in other regions. He became one of the representative figures of Cantopop in the 2000s. Cantopop was not restricted only to Hong Kong, but became part of a larger music movement.

In 2005, Cantopop began a new upswing. Major companies that drove much of the HK segment included Gold Typhoon Music Entertainment (EMI, Gold Label), Universal Music Group, East Asia Entertainment () and Amusic and Emperor Entertainment Group.

The decade was also dubbed a &quot;People&#x27;s singer&quot; era (), as most performers were frequently seen promoting publicly, in contrast with the 1990s when that era&#x27;s &quot;big-name&quot; singers () seemed unapproachable.

A number of scandals struck some of stars later in the decade. In 2008, the Edison Chen photo scandal, involving Edison Chen and Twins singer Gillian Chung among others, was the subject of explicit photos uploaded online. The scandal occupied the front pages of the local press for a solid month, and also garnered the attention of international media. The scandal tarnished the image of the previously &quot;squeaky-clean&quot; Twins, and resulted in their going into hiatus in late June 2008, four months after Gillian was caught up in the scandal. Other events include the street fight between Gary Chaw and Justin Lo. In 2009, Jill Vidal and her singer boyfriend Kelvin Kwan were arrested in Tokyo on 24 February 2009 over allegations of marijuana possession. Kwan was released without charge after 32 days in jail, while Vidal later pleaded guilty in Tokyo court to heroin possession, and was sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment, suspended for three years.

===2010s: Decline===
In the 2010s, Cantopop market shrank with fans, particularly the youth, turning to K-pop and Mandopop.

Mandarin became more important as a result of fast growing culturally and economically in China, the influence of Cantonese became vulnerable. Nevertheless, in addition to the 7 million people of Hong Kong and Macau, the genre continues to enjoy popularity among a Cantonese-speaking audience of in excess of 100 million in southern China, plus 10 million Cantonese-speaking diaspora in Canada, Australia and the United States. In 2010, a proposal that Guangzhou Television station should increase its broadcast in Mandarin led to protests in Guangzhou. While the authorities relented, this event reflects attempts at marginalising Cantonese and the ascendency of Mandopop.

In the 2010s, Cantopop industry still had outstanding singers and musicians who achieved success beyond the local market and made a mark in the Chinese music scene. Eason Chan is one of the most popular and influential Cantopop superstars. He captures wide audience across different regions, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, mainland China, Southeast Asia, UK, North America, Australia etc. He successfully held world tours in these regions in the 2010s. He was the first Chinese/HK singer who held solo concerts in London&#x27;s O2 Arena and Beijing&#x27;s National Stadium (Bird&#x27;s Nest). 

In the 2010s, there was revival for boy groups and bands in Cantopop with the rise of C AllStar, RubberBand, Supper Moment, Dear Jane, etc.

JSG Best Ten Music Awards Presentation was highly controversial with the ongoing HKRIA royalties case. The case was reportedly solved in early 2012 though. In January 2012, the JSG Awards 2011 was again controversial since one of the biggest awards, Song of the Year, was handed to Raymond Lam with his unpopular song &quot;Chok&quot;.

In 2015 and 2018, the Commercial Radio Hong Kong&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate Song Chart Awards Presentation &quot; handed &quot;My Favorite Male Singer&quot; award to James Ng and Louis Koo respectively, which were also controversial. Since then, the credibility of the Award has greatly declined.

In 2018, Eason Chan released an album &quot;L.O.V.E.&quot;&quot;&quot; (mainly in Cantonese), which was successful in Taiwan&#x27;s 30th Golden Melody Awards, winning nominations to three major awards: Song of the Year, Album of the Year, and Producer of the Year, Album. Ultimately, the album&#x27;s producer, Carl Wong, won the &quot;Producer of the Year, Album&quot; award. This was the first time in the history of the Golden Melody Awards that a Cantonese album won this award.

===2020s: Resurgence of Idols===

Interest in Cantopop was renewed in the early 2020s in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong, which led to border closures and restriction of travel. In addition to the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests and the passing of the Hong Kong national security law in June 2020, the resurgence of Hong Kong pride had led many Cantonese natives to support local music artists. The Cantopop boy group Mirror, which was formed through the ViuTV singing competition in &quot;Good Night Show - King Maker&quot; in 2018, skyrocketed in popularity during this time due to their distinctively local image. Media had described them as a &quot;Mirror phenomenon.&quot; Yet, their lacking in vocal skills has sparked controversy and disapproval among the public.

In February 2021, Hong Kong&#x27;s biggest television broadcaster, TVB, historically lifted its ban on four of Hong Kong&#x27;s biggest record labels, opening the doors for non-TVB artists to perform on the network. The move was described by local media as &quot;reviving the Cantopop music industry.&quot;

In 2023, Eason Chan released a new album titled &quot;Chin Up!&quot;, which included a Cantonese song &quot;Homo Sapiens&quot;（人啊人） with lyrics written by . This song made Chow won Taiwan&#x27;s 34th Golden Melody Awards - the Best Lyricist, marking the first time in the history of the Golden Melody Awards that a Cantonese song was nominated and won the award. This achievement created a historical record for Cantopop.

In 2024, at the age of 79, the renowned Temple Street King, Wan Kwong (尹光）, was voted to the final five of the &quot;My Favorite Male Singer&quot; category at the &quot;Ultimate Song Chart Awards Presentation,&quot; marking a record in the Cantopop industry. This was also the first time in over fifty years after his debut that he transitioned from performing at Temple Street to appearing at a major music awards ceremony. The &quot;Wan Kwong phenomenon&quot; caused a stir online, with fans appraising his continuous efforts in releasing his latest song, &quot;Dear Myself,&quot; which incorporated AI elements while others voting for him as a counterbalance to the idol genre because they had been sick of Mirror individual members’ live performances and Mirror fans&#x27; behavior in the poll.

==Characteristics==

===Instruments and setups===
Early Cantopop was developed from Cantonese opera music hybridised with Western pop. The musicians soon gave up traditional Chinese musical instruments like zheng and Erhu fiddle in favour of western style arrangements. Cantopop songs are usually sung by one singer, sometimes with a band, accompanied by piano, synthesizer, drum set and guitars. They are composed under verse-chorus form and are generally monophonic. Practically all early Cantopop songs feature a descending bassline.

===Lyrics===
Cantonese is a pitch sensitive tonal language. The word carries a different meaning when sung in a different relative pitch. Matching Cantonese lyrics to Western music was particularly difficult because the Western musical scale has 12 semitones. Through the work of pioneers like Samuel Hui, James Wong () and Jimmy Lo Kwok Tsim (), those that followed have more stock phrases for reference. Famous lyricists also include Albert Leung (林夕) and Wyman Wong (黃偉文).

Tonal constraints have been blamed for the decline of Cantopop in the late 1990s, for source of creativity being &quot;mined out&quot;. Its ramification includes interpretive constraint, where singers have less room for ad-lib change of pitch without sacrificing intelligibility. As a result, pitch change often encountered in western pop music becomes foreign to most of Hong Kong&#x27;s singers.

====Classical Chinese lyrics====
The first type is the poetic lyrics written in literary or classical Wenyan Chinese (). In the past, Cantopop maintained the Cantonese Opera tradition of matching the musical notes with tones of the language. Relatively few Cantopop songs use truly colloquial Cantonese terms, and fewer songs contain lyrics. Songs written in this style are usually reserved for TV shows about ancient China. Since the 1980s, increasing numbers of singers have departed from this tradition, though some big names like Roman Tam stayed true to traditional techniques.

====Modern Chinese lyrics====
The second type is less formal. The lyrics written in colloquial Cantonese make up the majority with compositions done in modern written Chinese. TV shows filmed under modern contexts will use songs written with these lyrics. Most songs share an over-riding characteristic, in which every last word of a phrase is rhymed.

The following is an example from the song &quot;Impression&quot; () by Samuel Hui. The last word of every phrase ends with &#x27;–oeng&#x27;.
===Covers of foreign compositions===
Cantopop was born in the 1970s and became a cultural product with the popularity of two popular TVB drama&#x27;s themes songs in the early 1970s: &quot;Tower Ballad&quot; (鐵塔凌雲, 1972) and &quot;A marriage of Laughter and Tears&quot; (啼笑因緣, 1974). The majority of &quot;hit&quot; Cantopop, however, is not entirely local produced but the cover versions of &quot;hit&quot; foreign melodies. Since the 1970s, covering &quot;hit&quot; external songs mainly from Japan, Korea, Taiwan or other Western countries became a common practice among Hong Kong record companies. At that time, Hong Kong&#x27;s constantly growing music industry acknowledges simply by using those hits, whose already gained popularity, will be the easiest way to reach success in the market. Cover versions were also widely used as a solution to address the shortage of the local hits due to the lack of local composers. Another reason for the use of cover versions is to minimise the production costs. The practice is also done for business reasons of filling up albums and re-capitalizing on songs with a proven record.

The Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) Top Ten Chinese Gold Songs Awards, which is one of the major music awards in Hong Kong since 1979, can reflect the great reliance on Japanese melodies in Cantopop. During the 1980s, 139 out of 477 songs from weekly gold songs chart were cover versions, and 52% of the cover versions were covers of Japanese songs. Numerous legendary songs of Cantopop superstars Alan Tam, Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui, for example &quot;Craziness&quot; (1983), &quot;Monica&quot; (1984), &quot;Foggy Love&quot; (1984), &quot;For Your Love Only&quot; (1985), &quot;Evil Girl&quot; (1985), &quot;The Past Love&quot; (1986), &quot;The First Tear&quot; (1986), and &quot;Fired Tango&quot;, were cover versions of Japanese hits, showing that covers contributed to the success of superstars to a certain degree.

By definition hybrids are still considered Cantonese songs due to the Cantonese lyrics, though the rights borrowed varies country to country. Songs like &quot;Tomorrow sounds like today&quot; () by Jenny Tseng, &quot;Life to seek&quot; () by Danny Chan, &quot;Snowing&quot; () by Priscilla Chan, and &quot;Can&#x27;t afford&quot; () by Jade Kwan were originally composed outside of Hong Kong. Many critics disapprove of the practice of covering foreign music and consider it lacking in originality, and many albums promoted themselves as &quot;cover-free&quot;.

== Canto-jazz ==
on January 29, 2010, Jacky Cheung released his Private Corner album coining the phrase &quot;Canto-jazz&quot;, to describe the concept of the album and the musical style of the songs.

In The South China Morning Post, Rachel Mok described &quot;Canto-jazz&quot; as a &quot;unique fusion of the two music styles&quot; of &quot;light jazz&quot; and canto-pop creating a fresh sound with a uniquely local flavour&quot;. She cited Jacky Cheung&#x27;s Private Corner and Karen Mok&#x27;s &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; among artists who have recorded Cantonese language albums in the new jazz genre coined &quot;canto-jazz&quot;.

An educational study traced the development of jazz in Greater China and explored the cross-cultural issues in rearranging a cantopop song for big band or jazz combo arrangement.

===Cantopop Stars===
Talent is unusually secondary to the success of a Cantopop singer in Hong Kong. Most times, image sells albums, as it is one of the characteristics of music similarly mirrored in the United States and Japan. Publicity is vital to an idol&#x27;s career, as one piece of news could make or break a future. Almost all modern Cantopop stars go into the movie business regardless of their ability to act; however, the reverse may also occur with actors releasing albums and embarking on concerts regardless of singing talent. They immediately expand to the Mandarin market once their fame is established, hence pure Cantopop stars are almost nonexistent. Outside of music sales, their success can also be gauged by their income. For example, according to some reports, Sammi Cheng earned HK$46M (around US$6M) from advertisement and merchandise endorsements in one month alone. Many artists, however, begin with financial hardships. For example, Yumiko Cheng owed her company thousands of dollars. Others include Elanne Kong crying in public with only HK$58 left.

Cantopop superstars include 70s: Sam Hui, Paula Tsui, Roman Tam, Frances Yip; 80s: Alan Tam, Leslie Cheung, Anita Mui, Beyond; 90s: Jacky Cheung, Leon Lai, Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok, Sammi Cheng, Cass Phang, Kelly Chen; 00s-10s: Eason Chan, Joey Yung, Miriam Yeung, Leo Ku. They successfully held world concert tours, e.g. Jacky in New York &#x27;s MSG, Faye in Tokyo&#x27;s Nippon Budokan, Eason in London&#x27;s O2 Arena and Beijing&#x27;s National Stadium (Bird&#x27;s Nest).

===Labels===
PolyGram, EMI, Sony, Warner and BMG were established in Hong Kong since the 1970s. Local record companies such as Crown Records (), Wing Hang Records (), Manchi Records () and Capital Artists () in the past have become successful local labels. As TV drama themes lost favour in the mid-1980s, market power soon drifted to the multi-national labels. Sales are tracked at the IFPI HK Annual Sales Chart.

<doc id="206382" wikidata="Q6264502" url="?curid=206382" title="John Wilson (Scottish writer)">
<text>John Wilson  (18 May 1785 – 3 April 1854) was a Scottish advocate, literary critic and author, the writer most frequently identified with the pseudonym Christopher North of &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Edinburgh Magazine&quot;.

He was professor of moral philosophy at the University of Edinburgh from 1820 to 1851.

==Life and work==
Wilson was born in Paisley, the son of John Wilson, a wealthy gauze manufacturer who died in 1796, when John was 11 years old, and his wife Margaret Sym (1753–1825). He was their fourth child, and the eldest son, having nine sisters and brothers.

He was educated at Paisley Grammar School and entered the University of Glasgow aged 12 (14 being the usual age at that time), and continued to attend various classes for six years, mostly under Professor George Jardine, with whose family he lived. During this period Wilson excelled in sport as well as academic subjects, and fell in love with Margaret Fletcher, who was the object of his affections for several years. Fellow student Alexander Blair became a close friend.

In 1803 Wilson was entered as a gentleman commoner at Magdalen College, Oxford. He was inspired by Oxford and in much of his later work, notably in the essay called &quot;Old North and Young North&quot;, expresses his love for it. However his time at Oxford was not altogether happy. Though he obtained a brilliant first class degree, he made no close friends at Magdalen College and few in the university. Nor was he lucky in love, for his beloved Margaret Fletcher eloped to New York with his younger brother Charles.

Wilson took his degree in 1807, and at the age of 22 was his own master with a good income and no guardian to control him. He was able devote himself to managing his estate on Windermere called Elleray, ever since connected with his name. Here for four years he built, boated, wrestled, shot, fished, walked and amused himself, besides composing or collecting from previous compositions a considerable volume of poems, published in 1812 as &quot;The Isle of Palms&quot;. During this time he also befriended the literary figures William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Robert Southey and Thomas de Quincey.

In 1811 Wilson married Jane Penny of Ambleside, daughter of the Liverpool merchant and slave trader James Penny, and they were happy for four years, until the event which made a working man of letters of Wilson, and without which he would probably have produced a few volumes of verse and nothing more. Most of his fortune was lost by the dishonest speculation of an uncle, in whose hands Wilson had carelessly left it. His mother had a house in Edinburgh, in which she was able and willing to receive her son and his family; he was not forced to give up Elleray, though he was no longer able to live there.

He read law and was elected to the Faculty of Advocates in 1815, still with many outside interests, and in 1816 produced a second volume of poems, &quot;The City of the Plague&quot;. In 1817, soon after the founding of &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, Wilson began his connection with the Tory monthly and in October 1817 he joined with John Gibson Lockhart in the October number working up James Hogg&#x27;s MS a satire called the &quot;Chaldee Manuscript&quot;, in the form of biblical parody, on the rival &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, its publisher and his contributors. He became the principal writer for &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot;, though never its nominal editor, the publisher retaining supervision even over Lockhart&#x27;s and &quot;Christopher North&#x27;s&quot; contributions, which were the making of the magazine.

In 1822 began the series of &quot;Noctes Ambrosianae&quot;, after 1825 mostly Wilson&#x27;s work. These are discussions in the form of convivial table-talk, including wonderfully various digressions of criticism, description and miscellaneous writing. There was much ephemeral, a certain amount purely local, and something occasionally trivial in them. But their dramatic force, their incessant flashes of happy thought and happy expression, their almost incomparable fulness of life, and their magnificent humour give them all but the highest place among genial and recreative literature. &quot;The Ettrick Shepherd&quot;, an idealised portrait of James Hogg, one of the talkers, is a most delightful creation. Before this, Wilson had contributed to &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot; prose tales and sketches, and novels, some of which were afterwards published separately in Lights and &quot;Shadows of Scottish Life&quot; (1822), &quot;The Trials of Margaret Lindsay&quot; (1823) and &quot;The Foresters&quot; (1825); later appeared essays on Edmund Spenser, Homer and all sorts of modern subjects and authors.

Wilson left his mother&#x27;s house and established himself (1819) in Ann Street, Edinburgh, with his wife and five children. His election to the chair of Moral Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh (1820) was unexpected, and the best qualified man in the United Kingdom, Sir William Hamilton, was also a candidate. But the matter was made a political one; the Tories still had a majority in the burgh council; Wilson was powerfully backed by friends, Sir Walter Scott at their head; and his adversaries played into his hands by attacking his moral character, which was not open to any fair reproach.
Wilson made a very excellent professor, never perhaps attaining to any great scientific knowledge in his subject or power of expounding it, but acting on generation after generation of students with a stimulating force that is far more valuable than the most exhaustive knowledge of a particular topic.

His duties left him plenty of time for magazine work, and for many years his contributions to Blackwood were voluminous, in one year (1834) amounting to over 50 separate articles. Most of the best and best known of them appeared between 1825 and 1835.

In 1844, he published &quot;The Genius, and Character of Burns&quot;.

In his last 30 years, he spent his time between Edinburgh and Elleray, with excursions and summer residences elsewhere, a sea trip on board the Experimental Squadron in the English Channel during the summer of 1832, and a few other unimportant diversions. The death of his wife in 1837 was a severe blow to him, especially as it followed within three years of his friend Blackwood.

==Death and legacy==
Wilson died at home at 6 Gloucester Place in Edinburgh on 3 April 1854 as the result of a stroke.

He was buried on the southern side of Dean Cemetery on 7 April. A large red granite obelisk was erected at his grave.

In 1865 a statue by Sir John Steell was erected to his memory in Princes Street Gardens. The bronze figure stands on a substantial stone pedestal and is located between the Royal Scottish Academy and the Scott Monument.

A scene from his play &quot;The City of the Plague&quot; was adapted by Alexander Pushkin as &quot;A Feast in Time of Plague&quot; and become a subject of a number of adaptations, including operas and a TV movie &quot;Little Tragedies&quot; (featuring Ivan Lapikov as The Priest).

==Family==
His brother James Wilson (1795–1856), was known as a zoologist.

On 11 May 1811 Wilson married Jane Penny, the daughter of James Penny, a Liverpool merchant. She was described as &quot;the leading belle of the lake country&quot;. They had five children, three daughters and two sons:

*Margaret Anne, married Professor James Frederick Ferrier
*Mary, his biographer, married John Thomson Gordon FRSE (1813-1865), sheriff of Midlothian and son of Dr John Gordon
*Jane Emily, married William Edmonstoune Aytoun
*John, a clergyman of the Church of England
*Blair, for a time secretary to the University of Edinburgh

He was cousin to Very Rev Matthew Leishman and they lived side by side during their childhood in Paisley. Wilson was also the great great great uncle of Ludovic Kennedy.

==Publications==
Publications include the &quot;Works&quot; of John Wilson, edited by P. J. Ferrier (12 volumes, Edinburgh, 1855–59); the &quot;Noctes Ambrosianæ&quot;, edited by R. S. Mackenzie (five volumes, New York, 1854); a &quot;Memoir&quot; by his daughter, M. W. Gordon (two volumes, Edinburgh, 1862); and for a good estimate, G. Saintsbury, in &quot;Essays in English Literature&quot; (London, 1890); and C. T. Winchester, &quot;John Wilson&quot;, in &quot;Group of English Essayists of the Early Nineteenth Century&quot; (New York, 1910).

<text>William Blackwood (20 November 177616 September 1834) was a Scottish publisher who founded the firm of William Blackwood and Sons.

==Life==
Blackwood was born in Edinburgh on 20 November 1776. At the age of 14 he was apprenticed to a firm of booksellers in Edinburgh, and he followed his calling also in Glasgow and London for several years. Returning to Edinburgh in 1804, he opened a shop in South Bridge Street for the sale of old, rare and curious books. He undertook the Scottish agency for John Murray and other London publishers, and gradually drifted into publishing on his own account (later known as William Blackwood and Sons), moving in 1816 to Princes Street. That same year, Blackwood convinced Walter Scott to abandon Archibald Constable as his Edinburgh publisher. Blackwood&#x27;s first deal as publisher was the next novel in Scott&#x27;s &quot;Tales of my Landlord&quot; series. 

On 1 April 1817, the first number of the &quot;Edinburgh Monthly Magazine&quot; was published, which on its seventh number became &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Edinburgh Magazine&quot;. &quot;Maga&quot;, as this magazine soon came to be called, was the organ of the Scottish Tory party, and round it gathered a host of writers. This included John Neal, making &quot;Maga&quot; the first British literary journal to publish work by an American, and the publisher of the first history of US literature, Neal&#x27;s series &quot;American Writers&quot; (1824–25). In 1825 he published Neal&#x27;s 1,324-page novel &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot; at a great financial loss. Their relationship fell apart shortly thereafter.

In 1829, he wrote to his son William in India telling him that he was moving from Princes Street to 45 George Street as George Street was &quot;becoming more and more a place of business and the east end of Princes Street is now like Charring Cross, a mere place for coaches&quot;. His brother Thomas bought 43 George and in 1830 Thomas Hamilton remodelled the entire frontage of the pair for the Blackwood Brothers. Thomas&#x27;s shop operated as a silk merchant.

At the end of his life, Blackwood was living at 3 Ainslie Place on Edinburgh&#x27;s elegant Moray Estate in the West End. His bookshop was within easy walking distance, being located at 45 George Street.

William Blackwood died in 1834 and is buried in an ornate vault in the lower western section of Old Calton Burial Ground.

==In fiction==
The character Oakstick in &quot;John Paterson&#x27;s Mare&quot;, James Hogg&#x27;s allegorical satire on the Edinburgh publishing scene, is based on William Blackwood.

==Family==

William Blackwood married Janet Steuart (1780–1849) on 29 October 1805. They had a large family. Most of his sons joined his publishing firm in some capacity. All are buried with him at the Old Calton Burial Ground except where stated:

*Alexander Blackwood (1806–1845)
*Robert Blackwood (1808–1852)
*Major William Blackwood (1810–1861) came later into the publishing business after a military beginning.
*Isabella Blackwood (1812–1897)
*James Blackwood (1814–1871)
*Thomas Blackwood (1816–1855) (buried in Boulogne)
*John Blackwood (1819–1879) who took over editorship of &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (buried in Dean Cemetery)
*Col Archibald Blackwood (1821–1870) adopted a military career, died in Simla in India.
*Janet Blackwood (1823–1870), married Archibald Smith and moved to London (buried in Kensal Green Cemetery)

<text>Eutin () is the district capital of Eastern Holstein county located in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein. As of December 2022, the town had some 17,000 inhabitants.

==History==
The name Eutin (originally Utin) is of Slavic origin. Its meaning is not quite clear; it is probably derived from the personal name &quot;Uta&quot;. The Slavic Obotrites tribe settled eastern Holstein in the 7th/8th centuries A.D. and built a castle on Pheasant Island in the lake now called the Großer Eutiner See.

The originally Slavonic settlement of &quot;Utin&quot; was populated in the twelfth century by Dutch settlers. In 1156 Eutin became a market town. Town rights were granted in the year 1257. It later became the seat of the Prince-Bishopric of Lübeck, as Lübeck itself was an imperial free city. When the bishopric was secularized in 1803, Eutin became part of the Duchy of Oldenburg. As a result of the Greater Hamburg Act of 1937, Eutin passed from the Free State of Oldenburg to the Prussian Province of Schleswig-Holstein. After World War II, it became part of the modern Bundesland of Schleswig-Holstein.

==Culture==
Eutin is birthplace of composer Carl Maria von Weber. To honor him, an open-air theater (&#x27;) was built in the park of Eutin Castle in 1951, and operas are performed there in July and August during the Eutin Opera Summer Festival (&#x27;). The seating capacity of this open-air venue is about 2000. The festival includes music students in Eutin as well as students from the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas, US, which is the twin city of Eutin.

Eutin hosts an annual Blues Festival (Bluesfest Eutin) at the beginning of summer. Local musicians, as well as up and coming blues artists from around the world, come to play at this three-day outdoor blues festival, which takes place in the market place in the center of town. As the costs are covered by sponsoring, public funding and volunteer helpers, admission is free.

==Geography and economy==
Eutin is surrounded by a number of lakes of the Holsteinische Schweiz, including the Großer Eutiner See, Kleiner Eutiner See, Kellersee and Ukleisee. Many of the lakes are surrounded by forests. Popular activities on these lakes include boating, canoeing, rowing, swimming, and fishing.

Schleswig-Holstein, particularly Eutin, is known for its numerous rapeseed fields, which are used for biofuel production. Wind turbines are also a common sight in this rural region.

Originally constructed as a fully functioning windmill in 1850 by Carl Friedrich Trahn, &quot;Die alte Mühle&quot; (the old mill) now serves as a bar and restaurant.

<doc id="206387" wikidata="Q1361929" url="?curid=206387" title="Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation">
<text>The Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation or Borneo confrontation (known as  in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore) was an armed conflict from 1963 to 1966 that stemmed from Indonesia&#x27;s opposition to the creation of the state of Malaysia from the Federation of Malaya. After Indonesian president Sukarno was deposed in 1966, the dispute ended peacefully.

The creation of Malaysia was a merger of the Federation of Malaya (now Peninsular Malaysia), Singapore and the British Crown colonies of North Borneo and Sarawak (collectively known as British Borneo, now East Malaysia) in September 1963. Vital precursors to the conflict included Indonesia&#x27;s policy of confrontation against Dutch New Guinea from March to August 1962 and the Indonesia-backed Brunei revolt in December 1962. Malaysia had direct military support from the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Indonesia had indirect support from the USSR and China, thus making it an episode of the Cold War in Asia.

The conflict was an undeclared war with most of the action occurring in the border area between Indonesia and East Malaysia on the island of Borneo (known as Kalimantan in Indonesia). However Indonesia also conducted lower intensity covert actions on the Malay Peninsula and in Singapore. The conflict was characterised by restrained and isolated ground combat, set within tactics of low-level brinkmanship. Combat was usually conducted by company- or platoon-sized operations on either side of the border. Indonesia&#x27;s campaign of infiltrations into Borneo sought to exploit how ethnically and religiously diverse Sabah and Sarawak were compared to that of Malaya and Singapore, with the intent of unravelling the proposed state of Malaysia.

The jungle terrain of Borneo and the lack of roads straddling the Indonesia–Malaysia border forced both Indonesian and Commonwealth forces to conduct long foot patrols. Both sides relied on light infantry operations and air transport, although Commonwealth forces enjoyed the advantage of better helicopter deployment and resupply to forward operating bases. Rivers were also used as a method of transport and infiltration. Although combat operations were primarily conducted by ground forces, airborne forces played a vital support role and naval forces ensured the security of the sea flanks. The British provided most of the defensive effort, although Malaysian forces steadily increased their contributions, and there were periodic contributions from Australian and New Zealand forces within the combined Far East Strategic Reserve stationed then in Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore.

Initially, Indonesian attacks on East Malaysia relied heavily on local volunteers trained by the Indonesian Army. Over time, the infiltration forces became more organised with the inclusion of a more substantial component of Indonesian forces. To deter and disrupt Indonesia&#x27;s growing campaign of infiltrations, the British responded in 1964 by launching their own covert operations into Indonesian Kalimantan under the code name Operation Claret. Coinciding with Sukarno announcing a &#x27;year of dangerous living&#x27; and the 1964 race riots in Singapore, Indonesia launched an expanded campaign of operations into Peninsular Malaysia on 17 August 1964, albeit without military success. A build-up of Indonesian forces on the Kalimantan border in December 1964 saw the UK commit significant forces from the UK-based Army Strategic Command. Australia and New Zealand deployed roulement combat forces from Peninsular Malaysia to Borneo in 1965–66. The intensity of the conflict began to subside following the coup d&#x27;état of October 1965 and Sukarno&#x27;s loss of power to General Suharto. A round of serious peace negotiations between the two sides began in May 1966, and a final peace agreement was signed on 11 August 1966 with Indonesia formally recognising Malaysia.

== Background ==
=== Political situation ===
Before &quot;Konfrontasi&quot;, Sukarno sought to develop an independent Indonesian foreign policy, focused on the annexation of Dutch New Guinea as a conclusion of the Indonesian National Revolution, and establishing Indonesia&#x27;s credentials as a notable international power supporting its own agenda distinct from those of the First and Second World. Indonesia was an important country in developing the Non-Aligned Movement, hosting the Bandung Conference in 1955. Indonesia had relentlessly pursued its claim to Dutch New Guinea from 1950 to 1962, despite facing multiple setbacks in the UN General Assembly in getting its claim recognised by the international community.

Following the Indonesian crisis in 1958, which had included the Permesta rebellion in eastern Indonesia and the declaration of the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia, Indonesia had emerged as a notable and rising military power in Southeast Asia. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), primarily through its Taiwan-based subsidiary Civil Air Transport (CAT), had been covertly providing support to rebels on remote islands, seeking to weaken, if not outright oust President Sukarno&#x27;s regime. Beginning in 1957, the CIA was increasing contact with military leaders in Sumatra and Sulawesi critical of the regime. By late 1957, the transport of weapons and ammunition to Sumatra by merchant ships and night submarines had become increasingly common, but the Americans believed that for their clandestine assistance to be truly effective, such operations required the use of British facilities in Singapore to refuel and support CAT missions launched in Bangkok, Taiwan, or the Philippines. With the influx of Soviet arms aid, Indonesia was able to advance its claim to Dutch New Guinea more forcefully. The diplomatic dispute reached its climax in 1962 when Indonesia launched a substantial campaign of airborne and seaborne infiltrations into Dutch New Guinea. While the infiltration forces were soundly defeated by Dutch and Papuan forces, Indonesia was able to lend credence to the threat of an Indonesian invasion of Dutch New Guinea. The Dutch, facing mounting diplomatic pressure from the Indonesians, and also the Americans, who were anxious to keep Indonesia from becoming Communist aligned, yielded and agreed to a diplomatic compromise, allowing the Indonesians to gain control of the territory in exchange for pledging to hold a self-determination plebiscite (the Act of Free Choice) in the territory by 1969. Thus by the close of 1962, Indonesia had achieved a considerable diplomatic victory, which possibly emboldened its self-perception as a notable regional power. It was in the context of this recent diplomatic victory that Indonesia cast its attention to the British proposal for a unified Malaysian state.

Before the British government announced the East of Suez policy in 1968, it had already begun re-evaluating their commitment to maintaining a presence in the Far East as early as the late-1950s. As a part of its withdrawal from its Southeast Asian colonies, the UK moved to combine its colonies in North Borneo with the Federation of Malaya (which had become independent from Britain in 1957), and Singapore (which had become self-governing in 1959). In May 1961, the UK and Malayan governments proposed a larger federation called Malaysia, encompassing the states of Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak, Brunei, and Singapore. Initially, Indonesia was mildly supportive of the proposed federation, although the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) was firmly opposed to it.

In Brunei, it was unclear whether Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III would support Brunei joining the proposed Malaysian state because of the implied reduction of his political office, and Brunei&#x27;s oil revenues ensured Brunei&#x27;s financial viability were it to choose independence. Furthermore, a Brunei politician, Dr. AM Azahari bin Sheikh Mahmud, while supporting a unified North Borneo, also opposed a wider Malaysian federation. In 1961, he had sounded out Indonesia about possible aid in training Borneo recruits; General Abdul Nasution hinted at moral support, and Soebandrio, the Indonesian foreign minister and head of intelligence, hinted at supplying more substantial aid. Azahari was a leftist who had fought in Indonesia in their war for independence. Following these meetings, Indonesia began training a small volunteer force called the North Kalimantan National Army (TNKU) in Kalimantan.

On 8 December 1962, the TNKU staged an insurrection—the Brunei revolt. The insurrection was an abject failure, as the poorly trained and equipped forces were unable to capture key objectives such as the Sultan of Brunei, the Brunei oil fields, or European hostages. Within hours of the insurrection being launched, British forces based in Singapore were mobilised for a prompt response. The failure of the insurrection was evident within 30 hours when Gurkha troops airlifted from Singapore secured Brunei town and ensured the Sultan&#x27;s safety.

The degree of Indonesian support for the TNKU remains a subject of debate. While Indonesia at the time denied direct involvement, it did sympathise with the TNKU&#x27;s objectives to destabilise the proposed Malaysian state. Following the TNKU&#x27;s military setback in Brunei, on 20 January 1963 Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio announced that Indonesia would pursue a policy of &quot;Konfrontasi&quot; with Malaysia, reversing Indonesia&#x27;s previous policy of compliance with the British proposal. This was followed by the first recorded infiltration of Indonesian forces on 12 April 1963 when a police station in Tebedu, Sarawak, was attacked.

=== People and terrain ===
In 1961, the island of Borneo was divided between four separate entities. Kalimantan, comprising four Indonesian provinces, was located in the south of the island. In the north, were the Sultanate of Brunei (a British protectorate) and two colonies of the United Kingdom—British North Borneo (later renamed Sabah) and Sarawak.
The three British territories totalled some 1.5 million people, about half of them Dayaks. Sarawak had a population of about 900,000, Sabah&#x27;s was 600,000 and Brunei&#x27;s was around 80,000. Among Sarawak&#x27;s non-Dayak population, 31% were Chinese, and 19% were Malay. Among non-Dayaks in Sabah, 21% were Chinese, and 7% were Malay; Brunei&#x27;s non-Dayak population was 28% Chinese and 54% Malay. There was a large Indonesian population in Tawau in southern Sabah and a large and economically active Chinese one in Sarawak. Despite their population size, Dayaks were spread through the country in village longhouses and were not politically organised.

Sarawak was divided into five administrative divisions. Sabah, whose capital city was Jesselton (Kota Kinabalu) on the north coast, was divided into several residencies; those of the interior and Tawau were on the border.

Apart from either end, the border with Indonesia generally followed a ridgeline throughout its length, rising to almost 2,500 metres in the Fifth Division. In the First Division, there were some roads, including a continuous road from Kuching to Brunei and around to Sandakan on the east coast of Sabah. There were no roads in the Fourth and Fifth Divisions or the Interior Residency, and in Third Division, there was only the coast road, which was some 150 miles from the border. Mapping was generally poor, as British maps of the country only showed tiny topographic detail. Indonesian maps were worse; veterans recall &quot;a single black and white sheet for all of Kalimantan torn from a school textbook&quot; in 1964.

Kalimantan was divided into four provinces, of which East Kalimantan and West Kalimantan bordered British Borneo. The capital of the West Kalimantan is Pontianak on the west coast, about from the border, and the capital of East Kalimantan is Samarinda on the south coast, some from the border. There were no roads in the border area other than some in the west, and no road existed linking East and West Kalimantan.

The lack of roads and tracks suitable for vehicles on both sides of the border meant that movement was limited to foot tracks mostly unmarked on any map, as well as water and air movement. There were many large rivers on both sides of the border, and these were the primary means of movement. There were also quite a few small grass airstrips suitable for light aircraft, as dropping zones for parachuted supplies, and helicopters.

The equator lies about south of Kuching, and most of northern Borneo receives over of rain each year. Borneo is naturally covered by tropical rainforests. This covers the mountainous areas cut by many rivers with very steep-sided hills and hilltop ridges often only a few metres wide. The high rainfall means large rivers; these provide a principal means of transport and are formidable tactical obstacles. Dense mangrove forest covering vast tidal flats intersected with numerous creeks is a feature of many coastal areas, including Brunei and either end of the border. There are cultivated areas in valleys and around villages. In the vicinity of abandoned and current settlements are areas of dense secondary regrowth. 

=== Sarawakian opposition ===
In 1946 the Raj of Sarawak, Charles Vyner Brooke ceded the state to the British Crown believing it to be in the best interest of the people of Sarawak following the end of World War II. Sarawak became a Crown colony, ruled from the Colonial Office in London, which in turn dispatched a governor for Sarawak. The predominantly Malay anti-cession movement, which rejected the British takeover of Sarawak and had assassinated Duncan Stewart, the first British High Commissioner of Sarawak, may have been the forerunner of the subsequent anti-Malaysia movement in Sarawak, headed by Ahmad Zaidi Adruce.

According to Vernon L. Porritt and Hong-Kah Fong, left-wing and communist cells had been present among Sarawak&#x27;s urban Chinese communities since the 1930s and 1940s. Some of the earliest Communist groups in Sabah included the Anti-Fascist League, which later became the Races Liberation Army, and the Borneo Anti-Japanese League, which was made up of the North Borneo Anti-Japanese League and the West Borneo Anti-Japanese League. The latter was led by Wu Chan, who was deported by the Sarawak colonial government to China in 1952. Other Communist groups in Sarawak included the Overseas Chinese Youth Association, which was formed in 1946, and the Liberation League along with its youth wing, the Advanced Youth Association, which emerged during the 1950s. These organisations became the nuclei for two Communist guerrilla movements: the anti-Malaysia North Kalimantan People&#x27;s Army (PARAKU) and the Sarawak People&#x27;s Guerrillas (PGRS). These various Communist groups were designated by various British and other Western sources as the Clandestine Communist Organisation (CCO) or the Sarawak Communist Organisation (SCO).
The SCO was predominantly dominated by ethnic Chinese but also included Dayak supporters. However, the SCO had little support from ethnic Malays and other indigenous Sarawak peoples. At its height, the SCO had 24,000 members. During the 1940s and 1950s, Maoism had spread among Chinese vernacular schools in Sarawak. Following World War II, Communist influence also penetrated the labour movement and the predominantly Chinese Sarawak United People&#x27;s Party, the state&#x27;s first political party, which was founded in June 1959. The Sarawak Insurgency began after the Brunei Revolt in 1962 and the SCO would fight alongside the Bruneian rebels and Indonesian forces during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation. The SCO and the Bruneian rebels supported and propagated the unification of all British Borneo territories to form an independent leftist North Kalimantan state. This idea was originally proposed by A. M. Azahari, leader of the Parti Rakyat Brunei (Brunei People&#x27;s Party), who had forged links with Sukarno&#x27;s nationalist movement, together with Ahmad Zaidi, in Java in the 1940s. However, the Brunei People&#x27;s Party was in favour of joining Malaysia on the condition it was unified with the three territories of northern Borneo with their own sultan, and hence was strong enough to resist domination by Malaya, Singapore, Malay administrators or Chinese merchants.

The North Kalimantan (or Kalimantan Utara) proposal was seen as a post-decolonisation alternative by local opposition against the Malaysia plan. Local opposition throughout the Borneo territories was primarily based on economic, political, historical and cultural differences between the Borneo states and Malaya, as well as the refusal to be subjected under peninsular political domination. Both Azahari and Zaidi went into exile in Indonesia during the confrontation. While the latter returned to Sarawak and had his political status rehabilitated, Azahari remained in Indonesia until his death on 3 September 2002.

In the aftermath of the Brunei Revolt, the remnants of the TNKU reached Indonesia. Possibly fearing British reprisals (which never came), many Chinese communists, possibly several thousand, also fled Sarawak. Their compatriots remaining in Sarawak were known as the CCO by the UK but called the PGRS—Pasukan Gelilya Rakyat Sarawak (Sarawak People&#x27;s Guerrilla Force) by Indonesia. Soebandrio met with a group of their potential leaders in Bogor, and Nasution sent three trainers from Resimen Para Komando Angkatan Darat (RPKAD) Battalion 2 to Nangabadan near the Sarawak border, where there were about 300 trainees. Some three months later, two lieutenants were sent there. The PGRS numbered about 800, based in West Kalimantan at Batu Hitam, with a contingent of 120 from the Indonesian intelligence agency and a small cadre trained in China. The PKI (Indonesian Communist Party) was firmly in evidence and led by an ethnic Arab revolutionary, Sofyan. The PGRS ran some raids into Sarawak but spent more time developing their supporters in Sarawak. The Indonesian military did not approve of the leftist nature of the PGRS and generally avoided them.

== Conflict ==
=== Beginning of hostilities ===
Sukarno&#x27;s motives for beginning the confrontation are contested. Former Indonesian Foreign Minister Ide Anak Agung Gde Agung argued years later that Sukarno intentionally muted Indonesia&#x27;s opposition to the proposed Malaysian state while Indonesia was preoccupied with advancing its claim to West New Guinea. Following Indonesia&#x27;s diplomatic victory in the West New Guinea dispute, Sukarno may have been emboldened to extend Indonesia&#x27;s dominance over its weaker neighbours. Conversely, Sukarno may have felt compelled by the ongoing pressure of the PKI and the general instability of Indonesian politics to divert attention towards a new foreign conflict.

In the late 1950s, Sukarno argued that Malaysia was a British puppet state, a neo-colonial experiment and that any expansion of Malaysia would increase British control over the region, with implications for Indonesia&#x27;s national security. Sukarno strongly opposed the British decolonisation initiative involving the formation of the Federation of Malaysia that would comprise the Malay Peninsula and British Borneo. Sukarno accused Malaysia of being a British puppet state aimed at establishing neo-imperialism and neo-colonialism in Southeast Asia, and also at containing Indonesian ambition to be the regional hegemonic power.

It was also suggested that Sukarno&#x27;s campaign against the formation of Malaysia was motivated by a desire to separate Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore as a separate country, hence not submitting to the British proposal for decolonization calling it as neocolonialism done by the British state as a way of spreading British hegemony in the region. Similarly, the Philippines claimed eastern North Borneo, arguing that the Borneo colony had historical links with the Philippines through the Sultanate of Sulu.
However, while Sukarno made no direct claims to incorporate northern Borneo into Indonesian Kalimantan, he saw the formation of Malaysia as an obstacle to the Maphilindo, a non-political, irredentist union spanning Malaya, Philippines and Indonesia. President of the Philippines Diosdado Macapagal initially did not oppose the concept and even initiated the Manila Accord. While the Philippines did not engage in hostilities, it did defer recognising Malaysia as the successor state to Malaya. Consequently, Malaysia severed diplomatic ties with the Philippines. Indonesia argued that the establishment of Malaysia allowed the United Kingdom to maintain her unique privileges regarding the use of the Singapore base and keep close ties to British defense needs in Southeast Asia constituted an implied threat. Subandrio, the Indonesian foreign minister, was careful to explain to American ambassador Howard P. Jones that the confrontation policy was concerned with Malaya not Malaysia and was a reaction to Malayan and British anti-Djakarta, pro-rebel activity in 1958, and promotion of program to split off Sumatra as diplomatic efforts to settle the Malaysian dispute picked up steam in the summer of 1963 through ministerial and summit level talks in Manila.

In April 1963, the first recorded infiltration and attack occurred in Borneo. An infiltration force training at Nangabadan was split in two and prepared for its first operation. On 12 April 1963, one infiltration force attacked and seized the police station at Tebedu in the 1st Division of Sarawak, about from Kuching and from the border with Kalimantan. The other group attacked the village of Gumbang, South West of Kuching, later in the month. Only about half returned. The confrontation could be said to have started from a military perspective with the Tebedu attack.

Before Indonesia&#x27;s declaration of confrontation against the proposed Malaysian state on 20 January 1963, the Cobbold Commission in 1962 had reported on the viability of a Malaysian state, finding that there was sufficient support in the Borneo colonies for the creation of a larger Malaysian state. However, due to hardening Indonesian and Philippine opposition to the Malaysia proposal, a new round of negotiations was proposed to hear the Indonesian and Philippine points of opposition. To resolve the dispute the would-be member states of Malaysia met representatives of Indonesia and the Philippines in Manila for several days, starting on 30 July 1963. Just days before the summit, on 27 July 1963, Sukarno had continued his inflammatory rhetoric, declaring that he was going to &quot;crush Malaysia&quot; (). At the Manila meeting, the Philippines and Indonesia formally agreed to accept the formation of Malaysia if a majority in North Borneo and Sarawak voted for it in a referendum organised by the United Nations. While the fact-finding mission by the UN was expected to begin on 22 August, Indonesian delaying tactics forced the mission to start on 26 August. Nevertheless, the UN expected the report to be published by 14 September 1963.
Before the Manila meeting, the Malayan Government had set 31 August as the date on which Malaysia would come into existence (coinciding with Malaya&#x27;s independence day celebrations of 31 August). However, at the Manila negotiations, it was persuaded by the Indonesian and Philippine Governments to postpone Malaysia&#x27;s inauguration until 15 September 1963 by which time a UN mission was expected to report on whether the two Borneo colonies supported the Malaysia proposal. However, following the conclusion of the Manila talks, the Malayan prime minister Tunku Abdul Rahman announced that the proposed Malaysian state would come into existence on 16 September 1963, apparently irrespective of the latest UN report.

North Borneo and Sarawak, anticipating a pro-Malaysian UN report, declared their independence as part of Malaysia on the sixth anniversary of Malayan independence, 31 August 1963, before the UN report had been published. On 14 September the UN report was published, once again providing general endorsement of the proposed Malaysian state. Malaysia was formally established on 16 September 1963. Indonesia immediately reacted by expelling the Malaysian Ambassador from Jakarta. Two days later, rioters organised by the PKI burned the British embassy in Jakarta. Several hundred rioters ransacked the Singaporean embassy in Jakarta and the homes of Singaporean diplomats. In Malaysia, Indonesian agents were captured, and crowds attacked the Indonesian embassy in Kuala Lumpur.

=== Ongoing campaign of infiltrations ===
Even as peace talks progressed and stalled, Indonesia maintained its campaign of infiltrations. On 14 August, a headman reported an incursion in the 3rd Division and a follow-up indicated they were about 50 strong. A series of contacts ensued as 2/6 Gurkhas deployed patrols and ambushes, and after a month, 15 had been killed and three captured. The Gurkhas reported that they were well trained and professionally led, but their ammunition expenditure was high, and their fire discipline broke down. The prisoners reported 300 more invaders within a week and 600 in a fortnight. The Battle of Long Jawai was the first major incursion for the centre of the 3rd Division, directed by an RPKAD Major Mulyono Soerjowardojo, who had been sent to Nangabadan earlier in the year. The proclamation of Malaysia in September 1963 meant that Malaysian Army units deployed former British Borneo now known as East Malaysia.

The deliberate attack by Indonesian forces on Malaysian troops did not enhance Sukarno&#x27;s &quot;anti-imperialist&quot; credentials, although the Indonesian government tried blaming their Navy Commando Corps (, KKO) as enthusiastic idealists acting independently. They also produced Azahari, who claimed that Indonesian forces were playing no part in active operations. Sukarno next launched a peace offensive and, in late January, declared he was ready for a ceasefire (despite having denied direct Indonesia involvement). Talks started in Bangkok, but border violations continued, and the talks soon failed. They resumed mid-year in Tokyo and failed within days but allowed time for a Thai mission to visit Sarawak and witness, well-equipped Indonesian soldiers withdrawing across the border, which they had crossed a short distance away earlier in the day.

Meanwhile, the Indonesian armed forces led by Lieutenant General Ahmad Yani became increasingly concerned with the worsening domestic situation in Indonesia and began secretly contacting the Malaysian government, while obstructing the confrontation, reducing it to a minimal level. This was implemented to preserve an already exhausted army which had recently conducted Operation Trikora in Western New Guinea, while also maintaining its political position in Indonesian politics, especially against the Communist Party of Indonesia, the ardent supporters of the confrontation.

=== Expansion of the conflict to the Malaysian Peninsula ===
On 3 May 1964, amid ongoing hostilities, Sukarno proclaimed the People&#x27;s Dual Command or &quot;Dwi Komando Rakyat&quot; (Dwikora). The Dwikora contained Sukarno&#x27;s call to defend the Indonesian Revolution and support revolutions in Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak and Sabah to destroy Malaysia. Co-ordinated to coincide with Sukarno&#x27;s announcement of the &#x27;Year of Living Dangerously&#x27; during Indonesian Independence Day celebrations, Indonesian forces began a campaign of airborne and seaborne infiltrations of the Malaysian Peninsula on 17 August 1964. On 17 August 1964, a seaborne force of about 100, composed of air force Rapid Response Troop (, PGT) paratroopers, KKO and about a dozen Malaysian communists, crossed the Strait of Malacca by boat, landing at Pontian in three parties in the night. Instead of being greeted as liberators, however, they were contained by various Commonwealth forces, and all but four of the infiltrators were captured within a few days. On 2 September, three Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft set off from Jakarta for Peninsular Malaysia, flying low to avoid detection by radar. The following night, two of the C-130 reached their objective with their onboard PGT paratroopers, who jumped off and landed around Labis in Johor (about north of Singapore). The remaining C-130 crashed into the Strait of Malacca while trying to evade interception by an RAF Javelin FAW 9 launched from RAF Tengah. Due to a lightning storm, the drop of 96 paratroopers was widely dispersed. This resulted in them landing close to 1/10 Gurkhas, who were joined by 1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment (1 RNZIR) stationed near Malacca with 28 (Commonwealth) Brigade. Operations were commanded by four Malaysian Brigade, but it took a month for the security forces to capture or kill 90 of the 96 paratroopers, with two men killed during the action.

Indonesia&#x27;s expansion of the conflict to the Malaysian Peninsula sparked the Sunda Straits Crisis, involving the anticipated transit of the Sunda Strait by the British aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Victorious&quot; and two destroyer escorts. Commonwealth forces were readied for airstrikes against Indonesian infiltration staging areas in Sumatra if further Indonesian infiltrations of the Malaysian Peninsula were attempted. A tense three-week standoff occurred before the crisis was peacefully resolved.

By the final months of 1964, the conflict once again appeared to have reached a stalemate, with Commonwealth forces having placed Indonesia&#x27;s campaign of infiltrations into East Malaysia in check for the moment, and more recently, the Malaysian Peninsula. However, the fragile equilibrium looked likely to change once again in December 1964 when Commonwealth intelligence began reporting a build-up of Indonesian infiltration forces in Kalimantan opposite Kuching, which suggested the possibility of an escalation in hostilities. Two additional British battalions were subsequently deployed to Borneo. Meanwhile, due to the landings in Malaysia and Indonesia&#x27;s continued troop build-up, Australia and New Zealand also agreed to begin deploying combat forces to Borneo in early 1965.

=== Operation Claret ===
Operation Claret was a long-running series of secretive cross-border raids conducted by Commonwealth forces in Borneo from June 1964 to early 1966. These raids were undertaken by special forces—including the British Special Air Service, Australian Special Air Service Regiment, and New Zealand Special Air Service—as well as regular infantry. During the early phases of the conflict, Commonwealth and Malaysian troops had attempted only to control the border and to protect population centres from Indonesian attacks. However, by 1965 they had decided to take more aggressive action, crossing the border to obtain information and in &quot;hot pursuit&quot; of withdrawing Indonesian infiltrators. First approved in May 1965, and expanded to include cross-border ambushing in July.

These patrols—which were highly classified at the time—often involved small reconnaissance teams crossing the border from the Malaysian states of Sarawak or Sabah into Indonesian Kalimantan in order to detect Indonesian forces about to enter East Malaysia. Initially, penetration was limited to but was later extended to , and again to after the Battle of Plaman Mapu in April 1965. Conventional follow-up forces of platoon and company size were then directed into position to ambush the Indonesians, either as they crossed the border or often while they were still in Kalimantan. Such operations were to be &quot;deniable&quot; and were conducted under a policy of &quot;aggressive defence&quot;. Given the sensitivity of these operations and the potential consequences if they were exposed, they were controlled at the highest level and conducted within strict parameters known as the &quot;Golden Rules&quot;, while the participants were sworn to secrecy.

Claret was largely successful in gaining the initiative for the Commonwealth forces before being suspended late in the war, inflicting significant casualties on the Indonesians and keeping them on the defensive on their side of the border. The operations were only publicly disclosed by Britain in 1974, while the Australian government did not officially acknowledge its involvement until 1996.

=== Easing of tensions ===

By the end of 1965, the conflict was at a stand still. The newly elected President of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos, was keen to ease tension and, to some extent, differed from his predecessor by not pursuing the North Sabah claim as fervently. In doing so, the new government planned to recognise the Federation of Malaysia. On February 5, it was announced that the Philippines would inform Indonesia a day in advance of its normalization of relations with Kuala Lumpur. Now truly isolated, Sukarno&#x27;s denounced Marcos&#x27;s actions in his speech, much to the surprise of Manila. Sukarno&#x27;s speech triggered a renewed wave of pledges of support for confrontation, with youth and religious organizations denouncing Marcos&#x27;s plan.
On the night of 30 September 1965, an attempted coup took place in Jakarta. Six senior Indonesian military leaders were killed, while General Nasution narrowly escaped from his would-be captors. In the ensuing confusion, Sukarno agreed to allow Suharto to assume emergency command and control of Jakarta and the armed forces stationed there. Blame for the failed coup was attributed to the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), and in the following weeks and months a campaign of imprisonment and lynching of PKI members and sympathisers broke out across Jakarta and Indonesia. With Suharto&#x27;s grip on power in Jakarta and Indonesia delicately poised, the scale and intensity of Indonesia&#x27;s campaign of infiltrations into East Borneo began to ease. The train of events set off by the failed coup led to Suharto&#x27;s gradual consolidation of power and marginalisation of Sukarno. At the same time, the anti-communist purge spread throughout Indonesia. Suharto&#x27;s steady consolidation of power after the events of 30 September allowed him to form a new government and in March 1967 Suharto was able to form a new cabinet that excluded Sukarno.

On 28 May 1966, at a conference in Bangkok, the Malaysian and Indonesian governments declared the conflict was over. However, it was unclear if Suharto was in full control of Indonesia (rather than Sukarno), and vigilance in Borneo could not be relaxed. With Suharto&#x27;s co-operation a peace treaty was signed on 11 August and ratified two days later.
During Suharto&#x27;s rise to power Claret operations continued and, in March 1966, a Gurkha battalion was involved in some of the fiercest fighting of the campaign during two raids into Kalimantan. Minor action by Indonesian forces continued in the border area, including an attempt at counter-battery fire against a 105 mm gun position in Central Brigade (reports from locals said the British return fire had turned over the Indonesian gun, thought to be 76 mm).

At the beginning of 1966, with Indonesia&#x27;s political hiatus beginning to stabilise (it had stopped a major RPKAD operation to capture a British prisoner), the RPKAD linked up with PGRS to establish guerrilla forces in Sabah and Sarawak. The Sabah effort never crossed the border; however, two groups entered Sarawak in February and May and obtained support from local sympathisers. The first group, despite losses in several contacts, lasted until June and exfiltrated on hearing about the end of Konfrontasi. Survivors of the second, after contact with Australian troops, also made it back to Indonesia. However, the final Indonesian incursion was in May and June. Signs of a substantial force were found crossing into Central Brigade. This was some 80 strong, mostly volunteers, led by Lieutenant Sombi (or Sumbi) and a team from 600 Raider Company. They moved fast towards Brunei with 1/7 Gurkhas pursuing and ambushing them; almost all were accounted for. In response to this, a final Claret operation was launched, which was an artillery ambush by 38 Light Battery.

== Counter-measures ==

=== Command arrangements ===

In early January 1963, the military forces in northern Borneo, having arrived in December 1962 in response to the Brunei Revolt, were under the command of Commander British Forces Borneo (COMBRITBOR), Major General Walter Walker, who was Director of Borneo Operations (DOBOPS) based on Labuan Island and reported directly to the Commander in Chief Far East Forces, Admiral Sir David Luce. Luce was routinely replaced by Admiral Sir Varyl Begg in early 1963. In the middle of 1963, Brigadier Pat Glennie, normally the Brigadier General Staff in Singapore, arrived as Deputy DOBOPS.

Politico-military authority lay with the Emergency Committees in Sarawak and North Borneo, including their governors, who were the Commanders in Chief for their colonies. In Brunei, there was a State Advisory Council answerable to the Sultan. After independence, supreme authority changed to the Malaysian National Defence Council in Kuala Lumpur with State Executive Committees in Sabah and Sarawak. Military direction was from the Malaysian National Operations Committee jointly chaired by the Chief of the Malaysian Armed Forces Staff, General Tunku Osman, and the Inspector General of Police, Sir Claude Fenner. The British Commander in Chief Far East Forces was a member. DOBOPS regularly attended its meetings.

=== Commonwealth order of battle ===

British forces in Borneo included Headquarters (HQ) 3 Commando Brigade in Kuching with responsibility for the western part of Sarawak, 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions, and HQ 99 Gurkha Infantry Brigade in Brunei responsible for the East, 4th and 5th Divisions, Brunei and Sabah. These HQs had deployed from Singapore in late 1962 in response to the Brunei Revolt. The ground forces were initially limited to just five British and Gurkha infantry battalions usually based in Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong, and an armoured car squadron. The police also deployed several light infantry of Police Field Force companies. However, as additional resources became available the size of the force available to Walker expanded, and by the end of 1964 British forces had grown to approximately 14,000 troops organised into three brigades (increased to four in 1965). The naval effort, under DOBOPS command, was primarily provided by minesweepers used to patrol coastal waters and larger inland waterways around Wallace Bay. A guardship – a frigate or destroyer – was stationed off Tawau.

Before the confrontation, no British military units had been stationed in Sabah or Sarawak. As the conflict developed increasing numbers of troops were required. There were three types of British Army deployment: Units stationed in the Far East for two years did a single 4-month tour (this applied to Australian and New Zealander forces); Gurkha units (all permanently stationed in the Far East) did 6 month tours, generally once every twelve months; UK based units (from Army Strategic Command) did 12 month tours including 6 weeks jungle warfare training in Peninsular Malaysia.

The initial air component based in Borneo consisted of detachments from squadrons stationed in Malaya and Singapore. These included Twin Pioneer and Single Pioneer transport aircraft, probably two or three Blackburn Beverley and Handley Page Hastings transports, and about 12 helicopters of various types. One of Walker&#x27;s first &quot;challenges&quot; was curtailing the RAF&#x27;s centralised command and control arrangements and insisting that aircraft tasking for operations in Borneo was by his HQ, not by the RAF Air Command Far East HQ in Singapore. Other aircraft of many types stationed in Malaya and Singapore provided sorties as necessary, including routine transport support into Kuching and Labuan. Rotary wing support included 60 naval and air force troop-lift helicopters and another 40 smaller army variants.
Patrols within Malaysia were supplied while in the field by RN Wessex and RAF Whirlwind helicopters, initially dropping supplies to the patrols from low level, and later after the patrols had cleared a landing area in the dense jungle, by landing. A test Joint Service deployment of a Westland SR.N5 hovercraft at Tawau was also trialled under Major John Simpson.

In addition to the ground and air force units, between 1963 and 1966 there were up to 80 ships from the Royal Navy, Royal Australian Navy, Royal Malay Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. Most of these were patrol craft, minesweepers, frigates and destroyers patrolling the coast-line to intercept Indonesian insurgents. One of the two Commando Carriers, HMS &quot;Albion&quot; and HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot;, was also committed throughout the confrontation usually in their transport role for troops, helicopters and army aircraft between Singapore and Borneo.

In the early stages of the conflict, Indonesian forces were under the command of Lieutenant General Zulkipli in Pontianak, on the coast of West Kalimantan about from the border. The Indonesian irregulars, led by Indonesian officers, were thought to number about 1,500, with an unknown number of regular troops and local defence irregulars. They were deployed the entire length of the border in eight operational units, mostly facing the 1st and 2nd Divisions. The units had names such as &quot;Thunderbolts&quot;, &quot;Night Ghosts&quot; and &quot;World Sweepers&quot;. However, as the conflict developed, the poorly trained and equipped &#x27;volunteers&#x27; had been replaced by regular units. Indonesian forces deployed along the border in Kalimantan increased significantly towards the end of 1964, with estimates of between 15,000 and 30,000 men, up from around 2,500 men in mid-1964.

=== Intelligence ===

A factor in the containment of the Indonesian forces was the use of intelligence. The Royal Signals were able to intercept the Indonesian military communications. The cyphers were decrypted by the Intelligence Corps based at Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) listening stations in Singapore, one of which was RAF Chia Keng which was linked directly to the RAF Far East Air Force headquarters at RAF Changi. Intelligence from this may have been used in planning some aspects of Claret cross-border operations.

=== British tactics ===
Soon after assuming command in Borneo, General Walker issued a directive listing the ingredients for success, based on his experience in the Malayan Emergency:
* Unified operations (army, navy and air force operating fully together)
* Timely and accurate information (the need for continuous reconnaissance and intelligence collection)
* Speed, mobility and flexibility
* Security of bases
* Domination of the jungle
* Winning the hearts and minds of the people (this was added several months later).

Walker recognised the difficulties of limited forces and a long border and, in early 1963, was reinforced with an SAS squadron from the UK, which rotated with another mid-year. When the SAS temporarily adopted 3-man instead of 4-man patrols, they could not closely monitor the border. Increasing the capability of the infantry to create a surveillance network was also considered essential.

Walker raised the Border Scouts, building on Harrison&#x27;s force of Kelabits, who had mobilised to help intercept the fleeing TNKU forces from the Brunei Revolt. He also utilised the experience of the Royal Marines as well as knowledge and skill of the Sarawak Rangers who had served during the Malayan Emergency. This was approved by the Sarawak government in May as &quot;auxiliary police&quot;. Walker selected Lieutenant Colonel John Cross, a Gurkha officer with immense jungle experience, for the task. A training centre was established in a remote area at Mount Murat in the 5th Division and staffed mainly by SAS. Border Scouts were attached to infantry battalions and evolved into an intelligence-gathering force by using their local knowledge and extended families. In addition, the Police Special Branch, which had proved so effective during the Malayan Emergency in recruiting sources in the communist organisation, was expanded.

British jungle tactics were developed and honed during the Malayan Emergency against a clever and elusive enemy. They emphasised travelling lightly, being undetectable and going for many days without resupplying. Being undetectable meant being silent (hand signals, no rattling equipment) and &#x27;odour free&#x27;—perfumed toiletries were forbidden (they could be detected a kilometre away by good jungle fighters), and sometimes eating food cold to prevent cooking smells.
In about 1962, at the end of National Service, British infantry battalions had reorganised into three rifle companies, a support company and an HQ company with logistic responsibilities. Battalion HQ included an intelligence section. Each rifle company was composed of 3 platoons of 32 men each, equipped with light machine guns and self-loading rifles. The support company had a mortar platoon with six medium mortars (3-inch mortar until replaced by 81-mm mortar around the end of 1965) organised into three sections, enabling a section to be attached to a rifle company if required. Similarly organised was an anti-tank platoon; there was also an assault pioneer platoon. The machine gun platoon was abolished, but the impending delivery of the 7.62 mm GPMG, with sustained fire kits held by each company, was to provide a medium machine gun capability. In the meantime, the Vickers machine gun remained available. The innovation in the new organisation was the formation of the battalion reconnaissance platoon, in many battalions a platoon of &quot;chosen men&quot;. In Borneo, mortars were usually distributed to rifle companies, and some battalions operated the rest of their support company as another rifle company.

The basic activity was platoon patrolling; this continued throughout the campaign, with patrols being deployed by helicopter, roping in and out as necessary. Movement was usually single file; the leading section rotated but was organised with two lead scouts, followed by its commander and then the remainder in a fire support group. Battle drills for &quot;contact front&quot; (or rear), or &quot;ambush left&quot; (or right) were highly developed. Poor maps meant navigation was important; however, the local knowledge of the Border Scouts in Borneo compensated for the poor maps. So tracks were sometimes used unless ambush was considered possible, or there was the possibility of mines. Crossing obstacles such as rivers was also handled as a battle drill. At night, a platoon harboured in a tight position with all-round defence.

Contact while moving was always possible. However, offensive action usually took two forms: either an attack on a camp or an ambush. The tactic for dealing with a camp was to get a party behind it then charge the front. However, ambushes were probably the most effective tactic and could be sustained for many days. They targeted tracks and, particularly in parts of Borneo, waterways. Track ambushes were close range, , with a killing zone typically long, depending on the expected strength of the target. The trick was to remain undetected when the target entered the ambush area and then open fire all together.

Fire support was limited for the first half of the campaign. A commando light battery with 105 mm Pack Howitzers had deployed to Brunei at the beginning of 1963 but returned to Singapore after a few months when the mopping-up of the Brunei Revolt ended. Despite the escalation in Indonesian attacks after the formation of Malaysia, little need was seen for fire support: the limited range of the guns (), the limited availability of helicopters and the size of the country meant that having artillery in the right place at the right time was a challenge. However, a battery from one of the two regiments stationed in Malaysia returned to Borneo in early to mid-1964. These batteries rotated until the end of the confrontation. In early 1965, a complete UK-based regiment arrived. The short-range and substantial weight of the 3-inch mortars meant they were of minimal use.
Artillery had to adopt new tactics. Almost all guns were deployed in single gun sections within a company or platoon base. The sections were commanded by one of the battery&#x27;s junior officers, warrant officers or sergeants. Sections had about ten men and did their own technical fire control. They were moved underslung by Wessex or Belvedere helicopters as necessary to deal with incursions or support operations. Forward observers were in short supply, but it seems that they always accompanied normal infantry Claret operations and occasionally special forces ones. However, artillery observers rarely accompanied patrols inside Sabah and Sarawak unless they were in pursuit of a known incursion and guns were in range. Observation parties were almost always led by an officer and were only two or three men strong.

Communications were a problem; radios were not used within platoons, only rearwards. Ranges were invariably beyond the capability of manpack VHF radios (A41 and A42, copies of AN/PRC 9 and 10), although the use of relay or rebroadcast stations helped where they were tactically possible. Patrol bases could use the World War II vintage HF No 62 Set (distinguished by having its control panel labelled in English and Russian). Until the manpack A13 arrived in 1966, the only lightweight HF set was the Australian A510, which did not provide voice, only Morse code.

==== British psychological operations ====
The revelations included an anonymous Foreign Office source stating that the decision to unseat President Sukarno was made by Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and then executed under Prime Minister Harold Wilson. According to the exposés, the UK had already become alarmed with the announcement of the &quot;Konfrontasi&quot; policy. It has been claimed that a Central Intelligence Agency memorandum of 1962 indicated that Macmillan and US President John F. Kennedy were increasingly alarmed by the possibility of the confrontation with Malaysia spreading, and agreed to &quot;liquidate President Sukarno, depending on the situation and available opportunities&quot;.

The role of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Foreign Office and MI6 during the confrontation was brought to light in a series of exposés by Paul Lashmar and Oliver James in &quot;The Independent&quot; beginning in 1997 and has also been covered in journals on military and intelligence history.
To weaken the regime, the UK Foreign Office&#x27;s Information Research Department (IRD) coordinated psychological operations (psyops) in concert with the British military, to spread black propaganda casting the PKI, Chinese Indonesians, and Sukarno in a bad light. These efforts were to duplicate the successes of the British psyop campaign in the Malayan Emergency. These efforts were coordinated from the British High Commission in Singapore, where the BBC, Associated Press, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; filed their reports on the crisis in Indonesia. According to Roland Challis, the BBC correspondent who was in Singapore at the time, journalists were open to manipulation by the IRD due to Sukarno&#x27;s refusal to allow them into the country: &quot;In a curious way, by keeping correspondents out of the country Sukarno made them the victims of official channels, because almost the only information you could get was from the British ambassador in Jakarta.&quot; These manipulations included the BBC reporting that communists were planning to slaughter the citizens of Jakarta. The accusation was based on a forgery planted by Norman Reddaway, a propaganda expert with the IRD. He later bragged in a letter to the British ambassador in Jakarta, Sir Andrew Gilchrist, that it &quot;went all over the world and back again&quot;, and was &quot;put almost instantly back into Indonesia via the BBC&quot;. Gilchrist himself informed the Foreign Office on 5 October 1965: &quot;I have never concealed from you my belief that a little shooting in Indonesia would be an essential preliminary to effective change.&quot;

In April 2000, Denis Healey, Secretary of State for Defence at the time of the war, confirmed that the IRD was active during this time. He officially denied any role by MI6, and denied &quot;personal knowledge&quot; of the British arming of the Army&#x27;s right-wing faction, though he did comment that if there were such a plan, he &quot;would certainly have supported it&quot;. Although MI6 was strongly implicated in this scheme by the use of the IRD (seen as an MI6 office), any role by MI6 itself is officially denied by the UK government, and papers relating to it have yet to be declassified by the Cabinet Office.

==== British Army ====
One squadron of the British Army&#x27;s 22 Special Air Service regiment was deployed to Borneo in early 1963 in the aftermath of the Brunei Revolt to gather information in the border area about Indonesian infiltration. There was a British Army presence until the end of the campaign. Faced with a border of , they could not be everywhere, and at this time, 22 SAS had only three squadrons. Also present were the Special Boat Service (SBS) of the Royal Marine Commandos. They had two sections based in Singapore. Tactical HQ of 22 SAS deployed to Kuching in 1964 to take control of all SAS and SBS operations. The shortage of SAS and SBS personnel was exacerbated by the need for them in South Arabia, in many ways, a far more demanding task in challenging conditions against a cunning and aggressive opponent.

The solution was to create new units for Borneo. The first to be employed in Borneo were the Pathfinder Platoon of the Guards Independent Parachute Company, which already existed as the pathfinder force of 16th Parachute Brigade. Next, the Gurkha Independent Parachute Company was raised. Sections of the SBS were also used, but mostly for amphibious tasks. Finally, the Parachute Regiment battalions formed patrol companies (C in the 2nd and D in the 3rd). The situation eased in 1965 when the Australian and New Zealand governments agreed that their forces could be used in Borneo, enabling both Australian and New Zealand SAS squadrons to rotate through Borneo.

SAS activities were mostly covert reconnaissance and surveillance patrols by four-person teams. However, some larger scale raiding missions took place, including amphibious ones by the SBS. Once Claret operations were authorised, most missions were inside Kalimantan, although they conducted operations over the border before Claret from about early 1964.

== Aftermath ==

The conflict lasted nearly four years; however, following Sukarno&#x27;s replacement with General Suharto, Indonesian interest in pursuing the war with Malaysia declined, and combat eased. Peace negotiations were initiated during May 1966 before a final peace agreement was ratified on 11 August 1966.

Although the Indonesians had conducted a few amphibious raids and an airborne operation against Malaya, the war remained limited throughout its duration and remained largely a land conflict. For either side to have escalated to large scale air or naval attacks &quot;would have incurred disadvantages greatly outweighing the marginal military effect that they might have produced&quot;. The UK Secretary of State for Defence at the time, Denis Healey, described the campaign as &quot;one of the most efficient uses of military forces in the history of the world&quot;. British Commonwealth forces peaked at 17,000 deployed in Borneo, with another 10,000 more available in Malaya and Singapore.

=== Casualties ===


Total British Commonwealth military casualties were 280 killed and 180 wounded, the greatest number of them were British. Gurkha losses were 43 killed and 83 wounded, losses among other British armed forces were 19 killed and 44 wounded. Australian casualties were 16 killed, of whom 7 were killed in action, and 9 wounded. New Zealand casualties were 7 killed and another 7 wounded or injured. The remaining casualties were that of the Malaysian military, police, and Border Scouts. A significant number of British casualties occurred during helicopter accidents, including a Belvedere crash that killed several SAS commanders and a Foreign Office official, possibly a member of MI6. A Wessex collision also killed several men from 2nd Parachute Battalion, and a Westland Scout crash, on 16 July 1964, near Kluang airfield, killed the two crewmen from 656 Sqn AAC. Finally, in August 1966, there remained two British and two Australian soldiers missing and presumed dead, with the Australians (both from the SASR) having probably drowned while crossing a swollen river. The remains of a Royal Marine were recovered some 20 years later. Altogether, 36 civilians were killed, 53 wounded and 4 captured, with most being local inhabitants.

Indonesian casualties were estimated at 590 killed, 222 wounded and 771 captured.

=== Awards ===
A number of British Commonwealth soldiers were awarded gallantry awards for actions during the campaign. No Distinguished Flying Cross or naval awards were made.

All Indonesian military or police personnel involved in the conflict were given the Northern Borneo Military Campaign Medal (). And two Indonesian marines (Usman and Harun) were honoured as National Heroes of Indonesia.

<doc id="206389" wikidata="Q1341654" url="?curid=206389" title="Peter O'Donnell">
<text>Peter O&#x27;Donnell (11 April 1920 – 3 May 2010) was an English writer of mysteries and of comic strips, best known as the creator of &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot;, an action heroine/undercover trouble-shooter. He was also an award-winning gothic historical romance novelist who wrote under the female pseudonym Madeleine Brent, in 1978, his novel &quot;Merlin&#x27;s Keep&quot; won the Romantic Novel of the Year Award by the Romantic Novelists&#x27; Association.

==Biography==
Born on 11 April 1920 in Lewisham, London, O&#x27;Donnell was the son of Bernard O&#x27;Donnell, a journalist on the &quot;Empire News&quot;, and was educated at Catford Central School.

He began to write professionally at the age of 16. In 1938 he joined the British Army, and during the war served as an NCO in mobile radio detachment (3 Corps) of Royal Corps of Signals in the 8th Army. He saw active service in Persia in 1942, after which his unit was moved to Syria, Egypt, the Western Desert, and Italy, and he was with forces that went into Greece in October 1944. After the war, O&#x27;Donnell returned to civilian life and began to script comic strips, including an adaptation for the &quot;Daily Express&quot; of the James Bond novel, &quot;Dr. No&quot;. From 1953 to 1966 he wrote for &quot;Garth&quot;, and from 1956 to 1962 &quot;Romeo Brown&quot; (with Jim Holdaway as an artist). 

In addition to the comic strips and graphic novels based on &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot;, O&#x27;Donnell published two collections of short stories and twenty novels. He wrote a play that was widely performed in the 1980s, &quot;Mr. Fothergill&#x27;s Murder&quot;, and wrote for television and film. He wrote for women&#x27;s magazines and children&#x27;s papers early in his career. His most famous creation, &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot;, was first published in 1963 in comic strip form. For the first seven years, the strip was illustrated by Holdaway until his death in 1970. Enrique Badia Romero then became the artist, and except for a seven-year period (1979–86) he drew the strip until it ended in 2001. 

In 1965, O&#x27;Donnell novelized his screenplay for a motion picture version (the final release of which in 1966 used virtually nothing of O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s original material), which was published as &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot;. This book was a huge success and O&#x27;Donnell would publish a dozen more novels and short story collections until 1996. Kingsley Amis said the novels were &quot;endlessly fascinating&quot; and that Blaise and Garvin were &quot;one of the great partnerships in fiction, bearing comparison with that of Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson.&quot;

At the request of publisher Ernest Hecht, O&#x27;Donnell began writing gothic romance and adventure novels under the pen name of Madeleine Brent. The novels are not a series, but feature a variety of strong female protagonists. They are written in first person, take place in the late Victorian era, and although every protagonist has connections to England, part of each book is set in various locations around the world—including China, Australia, Afghanistan, and Mexico. In 2001, O&#x27;Donnell retired from writing the &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; comic strip (the lead characters having been given a definitive end in the previous &quot;Cobra Trap&quot; short story collection) and was also said to have retired from full-time writing (in 2002, he gave Romero permission to adapt one of his short stories, &quot;The Dark Angels&quot;, to a comic initially published in Scandinavian anthology magazine &quot;Agent X9&quot; and later reprinted by &quot;Comics Revue&quot; magazine in the US). From 2004 to 2009 he wrote the introductions for a series of &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; comic strip reprint volumes published by Titan Books; beginning in 2010, just prior to O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s death, another writer had begun composing these introductions. He was also interviewed for a special feature included on the DVD release of the 2004 film &quot;My Name Is Modesty&quot;, which was based on his creation.

O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s wish was that no one else write any future Modesty Blaise stories, but whether this was ever formalized is unknown. With the exception of &quot;The Dark Angels&quot; adaptation and the &quot;My Name is Modesty&quot; film, no further new productions related to the character have been released as of 2015. In 2007, working with young women students at Bullers Wood and Newstead Wood schools, O&#x27;Donnell established an official website, Modesty Blaise, Ltd.

==Death==
According to his obituary in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, O&#x27;Donnell had been suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease in his later years. He died in May 2010, aged 90, in Brighton, Sussex. He is buried in the same grave with his wife, Constance, at Lawn Memorial Cemetery, Warren Road, Woodingdean, Brighton, Sussex.

<doc id="206391" wikidata="Q834764" url="?curid=206391" title="Sven Hassel">
<text>Sven Hassel was the pen name of the Danish-born Børge Willy Redsted Pedersen (19 April 1917 – 21 September 2012) known for his novels about German soldiers fighting in World War II. In Denmark he used the pen name &quot;Sven Hazel&quot;. He is one of the bestselling Danish authors, possibly second only to Hans Christian Andersen.

Hassel claimed his authorship was based on being a veteran of the German &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; who had fought in the Battle of Berlin in 1945 until he surrendered to the Soviets. However, numerous post-war investigations have proved his claims to be false and outright fabrications. In fact Hassel (as Pedersen) was a Danish criminal who did join the German Army but was incarcerated for having lied about his convictions. He was not captured in Berlin because he was in prison in Denmark. In the post-war period he gave a false testament which led to the arrest and imprisonment of innocent people.

==Biographical details==
Hassel claimed that at the age of 14 he joined the merchant navy as a cabin boy and worked on ships until his military service in 1936. He said that he then joined the German Army and served in tank units during World War II.

Hassel claimed to have surrendered to Soviet troops in Berlin in 1945 and to have spent the following years in prisoner-of-war camps in various countries, independent sources state that he was arrested in Denmark in 1945 after the liberation and was held in prison there, first as a suspect and then as a convicted criminal. Hassel was released from prison in 1949 after having served four years out of his ten-year prison sentence.

After his release, Hassel claimed he planned to join the French Foreign Legion until he met his future wife. He and Laura Dorthea Guldbæk Jensen, a divorced film translator from Nørre Tranders who was four years his senior, married in Copenhagen in January 1951.

In 1964, he moved to Barcelona, Spain, where he lived until his death.

==WWII author==
In 1953 his debut novel &quot;Legion of the Damned&quot; was published under the pen name &quot;Sven Hazel&quot; by Grafisk Forlag after their consultant &quot;Georgjedde&quot; (Georg Gjedde-Simonsen) had abbreviated and rewritten the manuscript.

Hassel&#x27;s books are written in the first person, with Hassel himself as a character, though not necessarily the lead character. The books describe the exploits of a 27th (Penal) Panzer Regiment composed of expendable soldiers – sentenced criminals, court-martialed soldiers and political undesirables. In addition to Sven, they include Alfred Kalb, &quot;Legionnaire&quot; (ex-member of the French Foreign Legion); Wolfgang Creutzfeldt, a giant of a man ironically named Tiny (variously Little John in some of the books); barracks fixer and shrewd thief Joseph Porta; older sergeant Willie Beier, &quot;Old Un&quot; or &quot;Old Man&quot;; Julius Heide, a Nazi fanatic, Barcelona Blom, a veteran of both sides of the Spanish Civil War, Gregor Martin, who was a removals man before the war, Chief Mechanic Wolf, and Staff Sergeant Hoffman, a non-commissioned officer. They serve on many fronts, including northern Finland, USSR, Italy (&quot;Monte Cassino&quot;), Greece (&quot;The Bloody Road to Death&quot;), the Balkans, and France (&quot;Liquidate Paris&quot;, set during and after the Normandy Invasion). The majority of the action occurs in the USSR. Due to errors in chronology, the regiment fights in several places, hundreds of kilometres apart, at the same time. In some of the books the 27th Regiment does guard duty for the Gestapo in Hamburg (&quot;Assignment Gestapo&quot;) and also at the military prison at Torgau (&quot;March Battalion&quot;). 

Hassel claimed that whilst his novels were essentially works of fiction, his characters were based on real people and some events were related to historical events. His view of war is brutal. In his books, soldiers fight only to survive, with the Geneva Convention rarely being observed on the Eastern front. People are killed by chance or with very little reason. Occasional pleasant events and peaceful meetings are brutally cut short. Unsympathetic Prussian officers constantly threaten their men with courts-martial and execute them with little provocation. Disgruntled soldiers occasionally kill their own officers to get rid of them. By graphically portraying war as violent and hopeless in such manner, Hassel&#x27;s books have been said to contain an anti-war message.

In total he published 14 novels which have been translated into 18 languages. In 1987 his book &quot;Wheels of Terror&quot; was made into a film of the same title and also known as &quot;The Misfit Brigade&quot;.

Hassel&#x27;s books are particularly popular in the United Kingdom, where he sold 15 million of the 53 million sold worldwide. In contrast his books are not deemed suitable for the public libraries in his home country Denmark where a 2011 opinion piece on literature in &quot;Dagbladet Information&quot; described Hassel as a traitor and his debut novel as the worst book ever with its characters plagiarized from &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;.

==Børge Willy Redsted Pedersen==
===Documentary evidence===
On 23 August 1942 the resistance newspaper &quot;De Frie Danske&quot; reported that on 13 August a Cadillac registered to DNSAP leader Frits Clausen had crashed in Copenhagen. A &quot;Børge Petersen&quot; involved in the crash first disappeared but was later apprehended and awaited trial. DNSAP subsequently issued a statement that due to his prior convictions Børge Petersen was not and could never be a member of DNSAP. &quot;De Frie Danske&quot; opined that if this statement were true there would hardly be any members at all in DNSAP. The author Erik Haaest claimed that the criminal record of Børge Willy Redsted Pedersen shows that he was the aforementioned &quot;Børge Petersen&quot; and that he in connection with the car crash impersonated a police officer and that he was living at Høffdingsvej 21 with his parents. Haaest&#x27;s implication is that Pedersen&#x27;s claim that he was a naturalized German citizen fighting with the German armed forces is contradicted by his arrest in Copenhagen as a civilian with several prior convictions.

===Danish investigations===
On 10 October 1963 journalist George Kringelbach revealed in his radio programme &quot;Natredaktionen&quot; on P3 that Sven Hazel was a pen name for the convicted traitor Børge Willy Redsted Pedersen. Further, Kringelbach claimed that while Pedersen might have been in Germany during the war, it was not in a penal battalion. Rather, during the war he had been working for a German intelligence agency which collaborated with HIPO. Hassel&#x27;s publisher Grafisk Forlag subsequently offered all book dealers a refund for his most recent book and ceased collaboration with him. Pedersen therefore formed his own publishing company , which published the remainder of his books.

The controversial Danish writer Erik Haaest disputed Hassel&#x27;s claims for many years. According to Haaest, the author never served on the Eastern front but spent the majority of World War II in occupied Denmark and his knowledge of warfare comes second-hand from Danish Waffen-SS veterans whom he met after the end of the war. Haaest claims that during the war period, Hassel was in fact a member of the HIPO Corps or &quot;Hilfspolizei&quot;, an auxiliary Danish police force created by the Gestapo, consisting of collaborators. Haaest also alleges that Hassel&#x27;s first novel was ghostwritten and that, when it became a success, he employed his wife to write the rest of his books.

In 1976 Hassel threatened Haaest with a lawsuit for defamation in reaction to Haasts&#x27; publication of the book . A review of Haaest&#x27;s book quotes Hassel&#x27;s own statements and writes that his sentence of 10 years prison for treason was given primarily because he was an informant for the German occupation force in Denmark and argues that he could not both have been an informant in Copenhagen and been fighting deep inside Soviet territory.

===Fraud exposed===
In 2010 the Danish public service television channel DR2 dedicated one of its five episodes on scandals in Denmark to Hassel. The program explained that he at first was wildly popular among his Danish readers and celebrated as a Danish Ernest Hemingway, until in 1963 he was exposed as a fraud with a dubious wartime past. He became an outcast and had go into exile to continue publishing. The national Danish Radio which aired the exposure were subsequently forced to issue a retraction after Hassel provided corroborating documentation of his wartime service. With more than 50 million books sold, he is the most sold Danish author ever but never received recognition or forgiveness.

In March 2010, &quot;Berlingske Tidende&quot; gave a detailed account of Hassel&#x27;s exposure as a fraud and his post-war prison sentence. In 1963 the radio journalist George Kringelbach had participated in a reception Hassel gave to celebrate his ten years as a vastly successful writer. The reception saw participation by numerous dignitaries including ambassadors and envoys of six foreign countries. Until then the public was under the impression that Hassel was a real person and that his books were autobiographical. When during his late night radio programme Kringelbach subsequently revealed that Sven Hassel was a fictitious person and that the author was a convicted traitor, a major scandal ensued. The national radio of Denmark and Hassel reached a settlement, which at the time was seen as a retraction by the national radio. The settlement enraged Kringelbach&#x27;s colleagues and Kringelbach subsequently left his employer. According to &quot;Berlingske&quot;, the settlement actually acknowledges that Hassel was affiliated with the German intelligence agency E.T., the intelligence-gathering branch of HIPO. Based on the settlement, &quot;Berlingske&quot; went on to detail the 1947 sentence of Hassel. The sentence does indeed state that Hassel served in an armoured regiment of the German Wehrmacht. However, the newspaper goes on to explain that the author Haaest in 1976 had interviewed Hassel&#x27;s defence attorney, member of parliament and mayor of Copenhagen Edel Saunte. According to Haaest, Saunte had explained that in court Hassel had insisted that the charges against him should be extended with a clause that he had also served as a German soldier, although he had obviously never done that. After insisting several times, the judge ended the discussions with a statement to the effect that she could no longer bear his insistence on this nonsensical front line service, but that he would also be convicted for that, although it would not add to or detract from his prison sentence. &quot;Berlingske&quot; account ends with a statement from Haaest, that what actually happened is still a matter of belief, as well as a statement from Hassel&#x27;s son who refers to the official retraction from the national radio and said that his aging father had nothing more to add.

In 2012 the Danish World War II historian Claus Bundgård Christensen was quoted for his assertion that Hassel never served on the Eastern front and that his books are a fraud and not based on his personal experiences. The historian went on to speculate that Hassel got his information from his contacts in the German intelligence service.

During the last five years of his life Hassel acknowledged the controversy in his home country over his authorship with a statement in Danish that &quot;In Denmark Sven Hassel has been put down&quot; (&quot;I Danmark er Sven Hazel blevet rakket ned&quot;), which he compares to the worldwide sale of his books in 53 million copies.

In September 2023 another book about Børge Willy Redsted Pedersen was published by Danish former police officer Martin Q Magnussen. &quot;Den Falske Løjtnant&quot; asserts that documents about Pedersen had been stolen by an employee of the Danish national state archive and only returned by his widow in 2017. These documents include detailed court case paperwork from Pedersen&#x27;s post-war prosecution (he was sentenced to 10 years and served about 2) and Pedersen&#x27;s own diary. The book concludes that Pedersen had attempted to join the Waffen SS in 1941 and had been rejected because of his criminal record in Denmark (bicycle thefts, posing as an army officer - hence the title). He did successfully join the Wehrmacht in 1942 under a false name, where he did indeed serve in Ukraine in a panzer unit, and that he was indeed sent to a penal battalion for pretending to have been a veteran of the Spanish Civil War. After serving his sentence with the penal battalion he then absconded from the Wehrmacht while on leave in Copenhagen and served (under other aliases) as a guard and then in the Hipo corps, where he committed various acts of torture. After his identity was eventually discovered he managed to escape custody again but was eventually recaptured and remained imprisoned until the end of the war when he was accidentally released. The book also asserts that he was involved in various dishonest and subversive activities associated with the Danish legal follow-up to the war, which led to innocent people being prosecuted.

==Death==
On 21 September 2012 Hassel died, aged 95, in Barcelona. He was survived by his son.

<text>Nancy Grace Augusta Wake, (30 August 1912 – 7 August 2011), also known as Madame Fiocca and Nancy Fiocca, was a New Zealand born nurse and journalist who joined the French Resistance and later the Special Operations Executive (SOE) during World War II, and briefly pursued a post-war career as an intelligence officer in the Air Ministry. The official historian of the SOE, M. R. D. Foot, said that &quot;her irrepressible, infectious, high spirits were a joy to everyone who worked with her&quot;. Many stories about her World War II activities come from her autobiography, &quot;The White Mouse&quot;, and are not verifiable from other sources.

Born in Wellington, New Zealand, Wake grew up in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. By the 1930s, Wake was living in Marseille with her French industrialist husband, Henri Fiocca, when the war broke out. After the fall of France to Nazi Germany in 1940, Wake became a courier for the Pat O&#x27;Leary escape network led by Ian Garrow and, later, Albert Guérisse. As a member of the escape network, she helped Allied airmen evade capture by the Germans and escape to neutral Spain. In 1943, when the Germans became aware of her, she escaped to Spain and then went to the United Kingdom. Her husband was captured and executed.

After reaching Britain, Wake joined the Special Operations Executive (SOE) under the code name &quot;Hélène&quot;. On 29–30 April 1944 as a member of a three-person SOE team code-named &quot;Freelance&quot;, Wake parachuted into the Allier department of occupied France to liaise between the SOE and several Maquis groups in the Auvergne region, which were loosely overseen by Émile Coulaudon (code name &quot;Gaspard&quot;). She participated in a battle between the Maquis and a large German force in June 1944. In the aftermath of the battle, a defeat for the Maquis, she claimed to have bicycled 500 kilometers to send a situation report to SOE in London.

Wake was a recipient of the George Medal from the United Kingdom (17 July 1945), the Medal of Freedom from the United States (1947), the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; from France (1970: Knight; 1988: Officer), a Companion of the Order of Australia from Australia (22 February 2004), and the Badge in Gold from New Zealand (2006).

== Early life and education ==

Born in Roseneath, Wellington, New Zealand, on 30 August 1912, Wake was the youngest of six children. She was Māori through her great-grandmother Pourewa, believed to be of the Ngāti Māhanga iwi, who was reportedly one of the first Māori women to marry a European. In 1914, her family moved to Australia and settled at North Sydney.
Shortly thereafter, her father, Charles Augustus Wake, returned to New Zealand and her mother, Ella Wake (née Rosieur; 1874–1968) raised the children.

In Sydney, Wake attended the North Sydney Household Arts (Home Science) School.
At the age of 16, she ran away from home and worked as a nurse. With £200 (1928 currency) she had inherited from an aunt, she journeyed to New York City, then London where she trained herself as a journalist.

In the 1930s, she worked in Paris and later for Hearst newspapers as a European correspondent. She witnessed the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi movement and &quot;saw roving Nazi gangs randomly beating Jewish men and women in the streets&quot; of Vienna.

==The Pat O&#x27;Leary Line==
In 1937, Wake met wealthy French industrialist Henri Edmond Fiocca (1898–1943), whom she married on 30 November 1939. She was living in Marseille, France when Germany invaded. During the war in France, Wake served as an ambulance driver. After the fall of France in 1940, she joined the escape network of Captain Ian Garrow, which became the Pat O&#x27;Leary Line. In reference to Wake&#x27;s ability to elude capture, the Gestapo called her the &quot;White Mouse.&quot; The Resistance exercised caution with her missions; her life was in constant danger, with the Gestapo tapping her telephone and intercepting her mail.

In November 1942, Wehrmacht troops occupied Vichy France after the Allies&#x27; Operation Torch had started. This gave the Germans and the Gestapo unrestricted access to all parts of Vichy France and made life more dangerous for Wake. When the network was betrayed that same year she decided to flee France. Her husband, Henri Fiocca, stayed behind. He was later captured, tortured, and executed by the Gestapo. Wake described her tactics: &quot;A little powder and a little drink on the way, and I&#x27;d pass their (German) posts and wink and say, &#x27;Do you want to search me?&#x27; God, what a flirtatious little bastard I was.&quot;

In early 1943, in the process of getting out of France, Wake was picked up with a whole trainload of people and was arrested in Toulouse, but was released four days later. The head of the O&#x27;Leary Line, Albert Guérisse, managed to have her released by claiming she was his mistress and was trying to conceal her infidelity to her husband (all of which was untrue). She succeeded in crossing the Pyrenees to Spain. Until the war ended, she was unaware of her husband&#x27;s death, and she subsequently blamed herself for it.

==SOE==

After reaching Britain, Wake joined the Special Operations Executive and was trained in several programs. Vera Atkins, who was the senior female in the SOE overseeing the agents going into France, recalls her as &quot;a real Australian bombshell. Tremendous vitality, flashing eyes. Everything she did, she did well.&quot; Training reports record that she was &quot;a very good and fast shot&quot; and possessed excellent fieldcraft. She was noted to &quot;put the men to shame by her cheerful spirit and strength of character.&quot;

On 29–30 April 1944 as part of the three-person &quot;Freelance&quot; team headed by John Hind Farmer (code name &quot;Hubert&quot;), Wake parachuted into Auvergne province, France. Resistance leader Henri Tardivat discovered Wake tangled in a tree. He remarked, &quot;I hope that all the trees in France bear such beautiful fruit this year,&quot; to which she replied, &quot;Cut out that bullshit and get me out of this tree.&quot; Denis Rake, a radio operator, was the third member of the team.

The team was to be a liaison between London and the local maquis group headed by Émile Coulaudon (Gaspard). The team&#x27;s initial relationship with Gaspard was frosty. He wanted money and arms from the allies but was not cooperative until the French Forces of the Interior in London, the umbrella organization for the disparate resistance groups in France, instructed him to cooperate. SOE began sending in large amounts of arms, equipment, and money. Wake&#x27;s duties were pinpointing locations at which the material and money were parachuted in, collecting it, and allocating it among the maquis, including pay to individual soldiers. Wake carried with her a list of the targets the maquis were to destroy before the invasion of France by the Allies (which would take place on 6 June). The destruction of communication lines and other facilities throughout France would hinder the German response to the invasion.

Disaster. The reach of the maquis exceeded their grasp. On 20 May, Couloudon declared a general mobilization of resistance fighters, collecting in total about 7,000 men divided into three groups. His objective was to demonstrate that the resistance was able to liberate areas from the Germans with its own forces. On 2 June, the Germans launched a probing attack on Couloudon&#x27;s base at Mont Mouchet; on 10 June the Germans launched a larger attack, and on 20 June encircled Couloudon&#x27;s positions and forced the resistance fighters to flee after taking heavy casualties. Wake and the members of her team accompanied groups of maquis in a three-day , retreat westward to the village of Saint-Santin.

The bicycle ride. During the flight from the Germans, Rake, the radio operator, had left his radio and codes behind and the SOE team needed to be in contact with London. The nearest SOE radio and operator were in Châteauroux, Wake said she borrowed a bicycle and rode it to Châteauroux, found a radio near there, updated London on the situation, and then bicycled back to Saint-Santin, traveling in 72 hours. Fortunately for her, there were few Germans in the areas through which she bicycled.

With Henri Tardivat. After her bicycle ride, the Freelance team, with another recently arrived operator named Roger, a 19-year-old American marine, returned to Allier Department to join the resistance group of Henri Tardivat (who discovered her tangled in a tree when she parachuted in). In July two more Americans, Reeve Schley and John deKoven Alsop, joined their team as instructors. Neither spoke much French and Schley was nearly blind if not wearing his thick-lensed eyeglasses, but he impressed the maquisards with his immaculately tailored military uniform. Both proved to be effective instructors. Wake said that she and Tardivat initiated a series of attacks on German convoys and fought off an attack on their camp by the Germans in which seven French maquisards were killed. Her principal job, however, continued to be to organize the reception and distribution of arms and material for the resistance groups which was parachuted into Allier nearly every other night.

Wake claimed that she participated in a raid (not confirmed by other sources) that destroyed the Gestapo headquarters in Montluçon, killing 38 Germans. At one point Wake said she discovered that the men were using three girls as prostitutes and mistreating them. She coerced the maquis to release the women, to whom she provided a wash and new clothes. Nancy Wake set two of the girls free, but she suspected that a third was a German spy. After interrogating and exposing her, Wake ordered the resistance group to shoot the informer. They did not have the heart to kill her in cold blood, but when Wake insisted that she would perform the execution, they capitulated. Nancy Wake claimed that the spy girl spat and stripped naked in front of her before facing the firing squad. Wake showed no regrets for the execution. Wake also said that she killed an SS sentry with her bare hands to prevent him from raising the alarm during a raid. During a 1990s television interview, when asked what had happened to the sentry who spotted her, Wake simply drew her finger across her throat. &quot;They&#x27;d taught this judo-chop stuff with the flat of the hand at SOE, and I practised away at it. But this was the only time I used it – whack – and it killed him all right. I was really surprised.&quot;

After the invasion of southern France by American military forces on 15 August, the Resistance groups harried the retreating Germans. Her friend Tardivat was badly wounded and would lose a leg to amputation. During a victory celebration in Vichy, Wake learnt of the death of her husband. In mid-September, she and other members of the Freelance team, their job completed, returned to Great Britain.

==Post-war==
Immediately after the war, Wake was awarded the George Medal, the United States Medal of Freedom, the Médaille de la Résistance, and thrice, the Croix de Guerre. She worked for the intelligence department at the British Air Ministry, attached to embassies in Paris and Prague.

Wake stood as a Liberal candidate in the 1949 Australian federal election for the Sydney seat of Barton, running against Dr. Herbert Evatt, then deputy prime minister, attorney general, and minister for external affairs in the Ben Chifley Labor government. While Chifley lost government to Robert Menzies, Wake recorded a 13 percent swing against Evatt, with Evatt retaining the seat with 53.2 per cent of the vote on a two-party preferred basis. Wake ran against Evatt again at the 1951 federal election. By this time, Evatt was deputy leader of the opposition. The result was extremely close; however, Evatt retained the seat with a margin of fewer than 250 votes. Evatt slightly increased his margin at subsequent elections before relocating to the safer seat of Hunter by 1958.

Wake left Australia just after the 1951 election and moved back to England. She worked as an intelligence officer in the department of the Assistant Chief of the Air Staff at the Air Ministry in Whitehall. She resigned in 1957 after marrying an RAF officer, John Forward, in December of that year. They relocated to Australia in the early 1960s. Maintaining her interest in politics, Wake was endorsed as a Liberal candidate at the 1966 federal election for the Sydney seat of Kingsford Smith. Despite recording a swing of 6.9 per cent against the sitting Labor member Daniel Curtin, Wake was again unsuccessful. Around 1985, Wake and John Forward left Sydney to retire to Port Macquarie.

In 1985, Wake published her autobiography, &quot;The White Mouse&quot;. Later, after 40 years of marriage, her second husband John Forward died at Port Macquarie on 19 August 1997. The couple had no children. She sold her medals to fund herself, saying, &quot;There was no point in keeping them, I&#x27;ll probably go to hell and they&#x27;d melt anyway.&quot; In 2001, Wake left Australia for the last time and emigrated to London. She became a resident at the Stafford Hotel in St. James&#x27; Place, near Piccadilly, formerly a British and American forces club during the war. She had been introduced to her first &quot;bloody good drink&quot; there by the general manager at the time, Louis Burdet. He also had worked for the Resistance in Marseille. In the mornings she would usually be found in the hotel bar, sipping her first gin and tonic of the day and telling war stories. She was welcomed at the hotel, celebrating her ninetieth birthday there. The hotel owners absorbed most of the costs of her stay. In 2003, Wake chose to move to the Royal Star and Garter Home for Disabled Ex-Service Men and Women, in Richmond, London, where she remained until her death.

Wake died on 7 August 2011, aged 98, at Kingston Hospital after being admitted with a chest infection. She had requested that her ashes be scattered at Montluçon in central France. Her ashes were scattered near the village of Verneix, which is near Montluçon, on 11 March 2013. Her obituary was included in (and inspired the title for) &quot;The Socialite Who Killed A Nazi With Her Bare Hands: And 144 Other Fascinating People Who Died This Year&quot;, a collection of &quot;New York Times&quot; obituaries published in 2012.

==Honours==

Wake was appointed a Chevalier (knight) of the Legion of Honour in 1970 and was promoted to Officer of the Legion of Honour in 1988. Shortly after the war, she was recommended for decorations in Australia but was turned down. Decades later, Australia offered to award her medals but she refused, saying: &quot;The last time there was a suggestion of that I told the government they could stick their medals where the monkey stuck his nuts. The thing is if they gave me a medal now, it wouldn&#x27;t be love so I don&#x27;t want anything from them.&quot; 

In February 2004, Wake was made a Companion of the Order of Australia. In April 2006, she was awarded the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services&#x27; Association&#x27;s highest honour, the RSA Badge in Gold. Wake&#x27;s medals are on display in the Second World War gallery at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. On 3 June 2010, a &quot;heritage pylon&quot; paying tribute to Wake was unveiled on Oriental Parade in Wellington, New Zealand, near the place of her birth.

Minor planet 17038 Wake was named after her.

==Biographies==
In 1956, Australian author Russell Braddon wrote &quot;Nancy Wake: The Story of a Very Brave Woman&quot; (). A copy of the book, dedicated to Major Denis Rake MC who worked with Nancy Wake in the SOE undercover in France, was auctioned in 2022, in the same auction of Rake&#x27;s medals. Nancy Wake wrote her own account (first published 1985) with the original title, &quot;The White Mouse&quot; (&quot;The autobiography of the woman the Gestapo called the White Mouse&quot;) (). In 2001, Australian author Peter FitzSimons wrote &quot;Nancy Wake, A Biography of Our Greatest War Heroine&quot; (), a bestselling comprehensive biography of Wake. In 2011, German author wrote &quot;Codename Hélène: Churchills Geheimagentin Nancy Wake und ihr Kampf gegen die Gestapo in Frankreich.&quot; (translated: &quot;Codename Hélène: Churchill&#x27;s secret agent Nancy Wake and her fight against the Gestapo in France&quot;). The book was published in October 2012. In 2020, Simon and Schuster published Ariel Lawhon&#x27;s &quot;Code Name Helene&quot;, a fictionalisation of Wake&#x27;s exploits.

Claims that Sebastian Faulks&#x27; 1999 novel &quot;Charlotte Gray&quot; is based on Wake&#x27;s war-time exploits, as well as those of Pearl Cornioley, a British secret-service agent were rejected by the author. Faulks said, &quot;The truth about Charlotte Gray is that she was entirely invented. That&#x27;s the way good novelists work&quot;. Wake was also featured in a 2012 article in &quot;Military Officer&quot;.

==Portrayals==
An Australian television mini-series was released in 1987 entitled &quot;Nancy Wake&quot;, which is based on the 1956 biography by Russell Braddon. It was released as &quot;True Colors&quot; in the U.S.. Wake was played by Australian actress Noni Hazlehurst and Wake herself made a cameo appearance in the role of Madame Fouret. Wake also was made a consultant for the film but only after the script had been written. She criticised the script upon reading it, and she did so again at the launch of the mini-series. Wake was disappointed that the film was changed from an 8-hour resistance story to a 4-hour love story. The producers said that they did not have the budget for the longer version and that it was difficult to cover all Wake&#x27;s exploits in the reduced time frame. Wake also candidly criticized aspects that she felt were not a true depiction of events, and continued for the rest of her life to criticize the script. Similarly, Seasons 1 and 2 of the late 1980s British television series &quot;Wish Me Luck&quot; were based on her exploits and much of the dialogue was copied from her autobiography. Rachael Blampied portrayed Nancy Wake in the 2014 TVNZ docu-drama &quot;Nancy Wake: The White Mouse&quot;.

In 2002, Melissa Beowulf&#x27;s portrait of Wake was a finalist in the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize. It was later acquired by the National Portrait Gallery. Beowulf chose Wake as a subject to help ensure she received greater recognition within Australia.

Christine Croydon&#x27;s &quot;Underground&quot;, a play reviewing Wake&#x27;s life opened at The Gasworks Theatre in Melbourne in March 2019.

In 2019, the book &quot;Liberation&quot;, a historical novel based on the events of Wake&#x27;s wartime service, was released. Written by Imogen Kealey, the book&#x27;s dust jacket from the Grand Central Publishing edition released in April 2020 mentions that the story is in development as a &quot;major motion picture.&quot;

On 27 August 2020, it was announced that Elizabeth Debicki would star and executive produce a limited series about Wake titled &quot;Code Name Hélène&quot;, based on Ariel Lawhon&#x27;s novel of the same name.

<doc id="206394" wikidata="Q193875" url="?curid=206394" title="Sipahi">
<text>The sipahi ( , ) were professional cavalrymen deployed by the Seljuk Turks and later by the Ottoman Empire. &quot;Sipahi&quot; units included the land grant–holding (&quot;timar&quot;) provincial &quot;timarli sipahi&quot;, which constituted most of the army, and the salaried regular &quot;kapikulu sipahi&quot;, or palace troops. However, the irregular light cavalry (&quot;raiders&quot;) were not considered to be . The &quot;sipahi&quot; formed their own distinctive social classes and were rivals to the janissaries, the elite infantry corps of the sultans.

A variant of the term &quot;sipahi&quot; was also applied by colonial authorities to several cavalry units serving in the French and Italian colonial armies during the 19th and 20th centuries (see ).

==Name==
The word is derived from Persian and means &quot;soldier&quot; and is also transliterated as and ; rendered in other languages as: in Albanian and Romanian, &quot;sepuh&quot; (սեպուհ) in Armenian, () in Greek, or in Serbo-Croatian, Bulgarian, and Macedonian (Cyrillic: , ): in Bengali [sipāhī] &quot;sepoy&quot; (সিপাহী). The Portuguese version is also &quot;sipaio&quot; (with variants like &quot;sipai&quot;, &quot;cipaio&quot; and &quot;cipai&quot;), but in Spanish it was adapted as &quot;cipayo&quot;. The word &quot;sepoy&quot; is derived from the same Persian word . In Maldivian, the army&#x27;s soldiers are referred to as &quot;{ސިފައިން} &quot;sifain&quot;.&quot;

==Description==

The term refers to all freeborn Ottoman Turkish mounted troops other than &quot;akıncı&quot; and tribal horsemen in the Ottoman army. The word was used almost synonymously with cavalry. The sipahis formed two distinct types of cavalry: feudal-like, provincial (timariots) which consisted most of the Ottoman army, and salaried, regular (sipahi of the Porte), which constituted the cavalry part of the Ottoman household troops.

The provincial governors, or beys, were rotated every few years, preventing land inheritance. The provinces, or sanjaks, were not all equal since Anatolia and the Balkans were mostly ruled by Turks, while other areas of the empire were more flexible, adhering, somewhat, to local traditions.

The entwinement of land, military, politics, economics and religion was a way of life.
The timar system, where the sultan owned all land but individual plots of land, came with residential rights. The Ottoman people had rights to the land but the &quot;sipahi&quot;, a unique kind of military aristocracy and cavalry portion of the military, also lived on the land with the farmers (90% of the population) and collected tax revenues, usually in-kind, to subsidize the costs of training and equipping the small army, dedicated to serving the sultan. The &quot;sipahi&quot; did not inherit anything, preventing power centres from growing and threatening the supreme power structure. The locals on the timar used the land and all it produced.

== Timarli Sipahis ==

===Status===

The &quot;Timarli Sipahi&quot; or &quot;timariot&quot; (&quot;tımarlı&quot;) was the holder of a fief of land ( ) granted directly by the Ottoman sultan or with his official permission by beylerbeys. He was entitled to all of the income from that land, in return for military service. The peasants on the land were subsequently attached thereto. Timarli Sipahis&#x27; status resembled that of the knights of medieval Europe. Unlike medieval knights, they were not legally owners of their fiefs. The right to govern and collect taxes in a timar fief was merely given to a Timarli Sipahi by the Ottoman State. And in return, tımarli sipahis were responsible for security of the people in their timar, enlisting and training &quot;cebelu&quot; soldiers for the army.

A &quot;timar&quot; was the smallest unit of land held by a Sipahi, providing a yearly revenue of no more than 20,000 , which was between two and four times what a teacher earned. A () was a larger unit of land, yielding up to 100,000 akçe, and was owned by Sipahis of officer rank. A &quot;has&quot; () was the largest unit of land, giving revenues of more than 100,000 akçe, and was only held by the highest-ranking members of the military. A &quot;tîmâr&quot; Sipahi was obliged to provide the army with up to five armed retainers (), a &quot;ziamet&quot; Sipahi with up to twenty, and a &quot;has&quot; Sipahi with far more than twenty. The &quot;cebelu&quot; (meaning &quot;armed, armored&quot;) were expected to be mounted and fully equipped as the &quot;sipahi&quot; themselves; they were usually sons, brothers or nephews and their position was probably more similar to squires than men-at-arms.

Although &quot;timars&quot; were not originally granted to their holders until perpetuity (the state inheriting the land at the death of the landholder), by the end of the 17th century estates were passed on from father to son.

===Military===

In wartime, Timarli sipahis and their retainers were gathered under their (regiment) beys. Alay-beys were gathered with their troops under sanjak (province) beys, and sanjak-beys gathered under beylerbeys. If a battle was to be fought in Europe, Rumeli (Balkan) Sipahis took the honorary right flank under the Rumeli beylerbey, while the Anatolian beylerbey and his Sipahis took the left flank; when a battle was in Asia, positions were switched. This way, the Ottoman classical army&#x27;s flanks wholly consisted of Timariot cavalry, while the center consisted of Janissary infantry and artillery divisions.

The equipment and tactics differed between the Anatolian and Balkan Timarli Sipahi. The Anatolian Sipahi were equipped and fought as classic horse archers, shooting while galloping, yet they were not nomadic cavalry and their status was similar to medium cavalry class. Balkan Timarli Sipahis wore chainmail, rode barded horses and carried lances and javelins, and fought as medium cavalry.

Timarli Sipahis of the classical Ottoman period usually comprised the bulk of the army and did the majority of the fighting on the battlefield. While infantry troops at the army&#x27;s center maintained a static battle line, the cavalry flanks constituted its mobile striking arm. During battle, Timarli Sipahi tactics were used, opening the conflict with skirmishes and localized skirmishes with enemy cavalry. Regiments of Timarli Sipahis made charges against weaker or isolated units and retreated back to the main body of troops whenever confronted with heavy cavalry. During one regiment&#x27;s retreat, other regiments of sipahis may have charged the chasing enemy&#x27;s flanks. Such tactics served to draw enemy cavalry away from infantry support, break their cohesion, and isolate and overwhelm them with numerical superiority. Anatolian Sipahis had the ability to harass and provoke opposing troops with arrow shots. More heavily equipped Balkan Sipahis carried javelins for protection against enemy horsemen during their tactical retreats. All cavalry flanks of the Ottoman army fought a fluid, mounted type of warfare around the center of the army, which served as a stable pivot.

The standard equipment of Rumeli Sipahis of the classical Ottoman period consisted of a round shield, lance, sword, javelins, and plated armour. Their horses were barded. Standard equipment of Anatolian Sipahis in the same era was a round shield, composite Turkish bow, arrows, kilij (Turkish sword), and leather or felt armor. Besides these, Sipahis of both provinces were equipped with and maces, and , and axes. Anatolian Sipahis sometimes also carried lances.

Kapikulu Sipahis (Sipahis of the Porte), also known as the Six Divisions of Cavalry, were household cavalry troops of the Ottoman Palace. They were the cavalry equivalent of the Janissary household infantry force. There were six divisions of Kapikulu Sipahis: Sipahis, Silahtars, Right Ulufecis, Left Ulufecis, Right Garips, and Left Garips. All of them were paid quarterly salaries, while the Sipahis and Silahtars were elite units.

 (&quot;weapon masters&quot;) were chosen from the best warriors in the Ottoman Empire. Any Ottoman soldier who committed a significant deed on the battlefield could be promoted to the Silahtar division, although normally members of other mounted units, like Timarli Sipahis or one of the other less prestigious of the four divisions of Kapikulu Sipahis, were promoted this way. Infantry soldiers had to enlist as &quot;serdengecti&quot; (literally means giver of his head) and survive suicide missions to join Silahtar division. If a janissary ever became a silahtar, other members of the division with cavalry backgrounds despised him and former comrade janissaries considered him a traitor, but because the position and wealth of a silahtar was so attractive, Janissaries and other soldiers still enlisted for suicide missions.

The commander of the Silahtar division was the Silahtar Agha. He was the official weaponsmaster of the palace and a close personal aide of the sultan, helping him to don his armor. He was also a liaison officer who supervised the communication between the sultan and the grand vizier.

The Sipahi division was the most prestigious of the six divisions. Traditionally, sons of Ottoman élite (sons of Vezirs, Pashas and Beys) served in this unit. The Sipahis and Silahtars were granted timar fiefs near Istanbul, alongside their salaries. Ulufeci means &quot;salaried ones&quot;, and the members of two Ulufeci divisions weren&#x27;t granted timar fiefs. Garip means &quot;poor ones&quot; (because their equipment was lighter compared to the other four divisions) and were paid salaries.

The six divisions of Sipahis represented the Kapikulu cavalry in the same way that the Janissaries represented the Kapikulu infantry. Kapikulu means servant of the Porte. Servants of the Porte (Kapikullari) were legally servants of the Ottoman throne. They weren&#x27;t literally slaves, though their legal status was different from other Ottoman people. The Sultan had the power to directly command execution of his servants without any court verdict. Theoretically, the Sultan didn&#x27;t have this kind of power over other people, even simple peasants. If a freeman was promoted to one of Kapikulu Sipahi divisions, he considered automatically switched to (servant) status.

Equipment of Silahtar, Sipahi and Ulufeci divisions was plated mail, chainmail, round shield, sword, composite bow, arrows, lance, bozdogan mace and axe. Their equipment was similar to Rumeli (Balkan) provincial Timarli Sipahis, though they wore brilliant fabrics, prominent hats and bore ornamented polearms. The two Garip divisions were more lightly equipped.

In the classical period Ottoman battle formation, Kapikulu Sipahis were positioned back of the army as rearguards. They acted as reserve cavalry and bodyguards of Ottoman sultan and viziers. Their job included to join and reinforce Ottoman army&#x27;s flanks which otherwise consisted entirely provincial timariot sipahis.

The Sipahis of the Porte (Kapikulu Sipahis) were founded during the reign of Murad I. The Sipahi eventually became the largest of the six divisions of the Ottoman cavalry. Their duties included mounted body-guarding for the sultan and his family, as well as parade-riding with the sultan, having replaced the earlier Silahtar division for this duty.

== Rivalry with the Janissary corps ==
Since Kapikulu Sipahis were a cavalry regiment, it was well known within the Ottoman military circles that they considered themselves a superior stock of soldiers than Janissaries, who were sons of Christian peasants from the Balkans (Rumelia), and were officially slaves bounded by various laws of the devşirme.

They made great strides of efforts to gain respect within the Ottoman Empire and their political reputation depended on the mistakes of the Janissary. That minor quarrels erupted between the two units is made evident with a Turkmen adage, still used today within Turkey, &quot;&quot;, which, referring to the unruly Janissaries, translates into &quot;Horsemen don&#x27;t mutiny&quot;.

Towards the middle of the 16th century, the Janissaries had started to gain more importance in the army, though the Sipahis remained an important factor in the empire&#x27;s bureaucracy, economy, and politics, and a crucial aspect of disciplined leadership within the army. As late as the 17th century, the Sipahis were, together with their rivals the Janissaries, the &quot;de facto&quot; rulers in the early years of Sultan Murad IV&#x27;s reign. In 1826, after an evident Janissary revolt the Sipahis played an important part in the disbandment of the Janissary corps. The Sultan received critical assistance from the loyalist Sipahi cavalry in order to forcefully dismiss the infuriated Janissaries.

Two years later, however, they shared a similar fate when Sultan Mahmud II revoked their privileges and dismissed them in favor of a more modern military structure. Unlike the Janissaries before them they retired honorably, peacefully, and without bloodshed into new Ottoman cavalry divisions who followed modern military tradition doctrines. Older sipahis were allowed to retire and keep their tımar lands until they died, and younger sipahis joined the Asakir-i Mansure-i Muhammediye army as cavalry.

<text>Pinheirodontidae is a poorly known family of fossil mammals which belong to the informal suborder &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot; within the order Multituberculata. Remains are known from the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous of Europe (predominantly Portugal and Spain), but are so far restricted to teeth.

The family Pinheirodontidae was named by Hahn G. and Hahn R. in 1999, after the locality of Porto Dinheiro, in central west Portugal.

H&amp;M is the second-largest international clothing retailer after Inditex. H&amp;M was founded by Erling Persson in 1947 under the name Hennes. CEO from 2020 to 2024 was Helena Helmersson. Current CEO is Daniel Erver as of January 2024.

==History==
===Foundation===
The business was established in 1947 by Erling Persson when he opened his first shop in Västerås, Sweden. The shop was called Hennes (Swedish for &#x27;hers&#x27;) and only sold women&#x27;s clothing. Another store opened in Norway in 1964. In 1968, Persson acquired the hunting apparel retailer Mauritz Widforss in Stockholm, which led to the inclusion of a menswear collection in the product range, and the name was changed to Hennes &amp; Mauritz.

The company was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1974. Shortly after, in 1976, the first store outside Scandinavia opened in London. H&amp;M continued to expand in Europe and began to retail online in 1998 with the domain &quot;hm.com&quot;, which was registered in 1997 according to data available via WHOIS. The opening of its first U.S. store on 31 March 2000 on Fifth Avenue in New York City marked the start of its expansion outside of Europe.

=== Home furnishings ===

In 2008, the company announced in a press release that it would begin selling home furnishings. While initially distributed online, the home furnishing items are now sold at H&amp;M Home stores worldwide.

=== Other brands ===
Concept stores, including COS, Weekday, Monki and Cheap Monday, were launched following H&amp;M&#x27;s expansion in Asia. In 2009 and 2010, brand consultancy Interbrand ranked H&amp;M as the twenty-first most-valuable global brand. Its worth was estimated at $12 billion to $16 billion. Under the &quot;H&amp;M with Friends&quot;, H&amp;M will partner with Good American, a brand founded by Khloe Kardashian and Emme Grede, to feature their products in H&amp;M&#x27;s Swedish and German e-commerce shops. In 2017 H&amp;M founded a new concept store Arket.

=== Store openings worldwide ===
H&amp;M operated 2,325 stores at the end of 2011. At the end of August 2012, they were operating 304 more stores, bringing the total to 2,629. In September 2013, the retailer opened its 3000th store in Chengdu, China. In 2023, the company announced that it will enter the Brazilian market in both physical and digital formats, expected to begin operations in 2025.

=== COVID-19 ===
In October 2020, H&amp;M announced that it was planning to close 5% of its worldwide stores in 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The fashion retailer H&amp;M closed 250 shops throughout the globe and moved the majority of its operations online. The H&amp;M Group&#x27;s sales growth remained at −34% year-over-year from 2020 week 12 to week 22.

=== Withdrawal from the Russian market (2022) ===
Along with hundreds of other global companies, H&amp;M announced on 2 March 2022, an end to retail operations of its more than 150 stores in Russia as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. H&amp;M cited that it stands &quot;with all the people who are suffering&quot; in Ukraine as well as for &quot;the safety of customers and colleagues&quot; in Russia. Having recently expanded via its Weekday and &amp; Other Stories formats, Russia was H&amp;M&#x27;s sixth-biggest market at the time, representing 4% of group sales in the fourth quarter of 2021. The company also temporarily closed its Ukraine stores, which remain closed as of 2023.

=== Supplies ===
H&amp;M sources its clothing products from various countries globally. The primary manufacturing locations for H&amp;M products are China, Bangladesh, and India. While H&amp;M&#x27;s headquarters is in Sweden, it operates 21 supplier and factory locations within the country.

== Corporate affairs ==
The key trends for the H&amp;M Group are (as of the financial year ending 30 November):

== Sustainability and environmental awareness ==
{{POV|date=September 2023}}

=== Used garment vouchers ===
Starting in February 2013, H&amp;M began offering patrons a voucher in exchange for used garments. Donated garments were to be processed by I:CO, a retailer that repurposes and recycles used clothing with the goal of creating a zero waste economy. The initiative is similar to an April 2012 clothes-collection voucher program launched by Marks &amp; Spencer in partnership with Oxfam.

=== Endangered forests ===
In April 2014, H&amp;M joined Zara and other apparel companies in changing their supply chain to avoid endangered forests. The company teamed with Canopy, a nonprofit, to remove endangered and ancient forests from their dissolvable pulp supply chain for their viscose and rayon fabrics.

=== The H&amp;M Foundation ===
The H&amp;M Foundation, a nonprofit, was established in 2014 to fund projects that improve humanitarian and environmental issues within the fashion industry. The Persson family, the founders and owners of H&amp;M, originally invested $180 million in the foundation. One of the foundation&#x27;s projects includes the Green Machine, a recycling technology that would allow clothing to be recycled in a similar way to aluminum can recycling. Since 2013, the family has made contributions to the foundation, donating SEK1.1 billion (US$154 million) to it.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}} According to the OECD, H&amp;M Foundation&#x27;s financing for 2019 development increased by 7% to US$17 million. In August 2015, the H&amp;M Foundation announced that it will award the Global Change Award, a million-euro annual prize, to advance recycling technology and techniques within the fashion industry. In 2021, H&amp;M Foundation launched a virtual clothing collection named &quot;The Billion Dollar Collection&quot; that featured ten sustainable fashion innovation startups.

=== Brazilian leather halt ===
In September 2019, H&amp;M halted its leather purchases from Brazil in response to the 2019 Amazon rainforest wildfires. The company issued an email statement: &quot;The ban will be active until there are credible assurance systems in place to verify that the leather does not contribute to environmental harm in the Amazon.&quot; H&amp;M imports only a small fraction of its leather needs from the country.

=== Sustainability ambassador hiring ===
Actress Maisie Williams joined the brand as a global sustainability ambassador in April 2021. As a global sustainability ambassador, she helped front the company&#x27;s campaign on using only recycled or sustainably sourced materials by 2030. The first initiative fronted by the actress has led to a collaboration with the video game Animal Crossing, with Williams being transformed into a digital game character to teach the virtues of recycling.

=== Rental clothing ===
In May 2021, H&amp;M announced a temporary rental clothing service that allows men to rent suits for up to 24 hours for job interviews. It began in the UK and was also being tested in the United States.

=== Use of feathers ===
In 2024, the company said that about 90% of the down and feathers in its products came from recycled items but that by the end of 2025, none of their items would use virgin down or feathers.

==Concept stores==


===Six concept brands===
In addition to the H&amp;M brand, the company consists of six individual brands with separate concepts. Brands include Afound, Arket, COS, Monki, Weekday, and &amp; Other Stories.

====COS====
COS launched its flagship store on London&#x27;s Regent Street in March 2007 with a catwalk show at the Royal Academy. Its concept is encompassed by minimalist style inspired by architecture, graphics, and design.

It specializes in modern clothing pieces for men and women that are less trend-oriented than other similarly priced labels. COS makes clothing that can be worn beyond the season. COS has 197 stores in 34 countries in Europe, Asia, North America, Australia and the Middle East and currently retails online to 19 markets via &quot;cos.com&quot;.

===H&amp;M Details===
2016 saw the hoarding of a new H&amp;M concept in The Dubai Mall come up, labelled now &#x27;H&amp;M Details&#x27;.

==Labor practices==
=== Working conditions ===
==== Cambodia ====
In August 2011, nearly 300 workers fainted in one week at a Cambodian factory supplying H&amp;M. Fumes from chemicals, poor ventilation, malnutrition, and even &quot;mass hysteria&quot; have all been blamed for making workers ill. The minimum wage in the country is the equivalent of $66 (£42) a month, an amount that is less than half of what is required to meet basic needs, according to human rights groups.

==== Bangladesh ====
The same year, Bangladeshi and international labor groups put forth a detailed safety proposal that entailed the establishment of independent inspections of garment factories. The plan called for inspectors to have the power to close unsafe factories. The proposal entailed a legally binding contract between suppliers, customers, and unions. At a meeting in 2011 in Dhaka, major European and North American retailers, including H&amp;M, rejected the proposal. Further efforts by unions to advance the proposal after numerous and deadly factory fires have been rejected.

====Myanmar====
A report by the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC) found a significant rise in worker abuse allegations in Myanmar garment factories since the military coup in 2021. H&amp;M is investigating 20 such cases at their suppliers, while a report documented 156 in total over the past year. This has led some fashion brands like Inditex (Zara owner) to cut ties with Myanmar suppliers, while others like H&amp;M and Bestseller are increasing monitoring efforts. The decision to stay or leave is complex, with some arguing continued engagement offers leverage for improvement, while others fear a race to the bottom if major brands exit.

=== Supply chain transparency ===
&quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that in a conscious action sustainability report for 2012, H&amp;M published a list of factories supplying 95% of its garments. This contributes to the trend of corporations leaning toward ethically transparent supply chains.

=== Slave and child labour ===
On 2 January 2013, &quot;The Ecologist&quot; reported allegations by Anti-Slavery International that H&amp;M was continuing its association with the Uzbek government in exploiting child and adult forced labor as cotton harvesters in Uzbekistan.

In September 2020, amid international allegations over the use of Uyghur forced labor in Xinjiang, H&amp;M published a statement saying that it had stopped buying cotton from growers in Xinjiang, stating that it was &quot;deeply concerned by reports from civil society organizations and media that include accusations of forced labor and discrimination of ethno-religious minorities&quot;.

In February 2017, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported children were employed to make H&amp;M products in Myanmar and were paid 13p (about 15 cents US) an hour – half the full legal minimum wage.

Since then, H&amp;M has become a Fair Labour Association (FLA) member and has set a goal to achieve fair living wages throughout its supply chain by 2030.

=== Factory building structural collapses ===
==== Savar building, Bangladesh ====
In April 2013, the Rana Plaza building collapsed in Bangladesh killing over 1,100 people. Fatalities were mostly garment workers. The incident is considered the deadliest non-deliberate structural failure accident and the deadliest garment factory disaster in modern history. The eight-story building complex that was not designed for factory production and had cracks in the structure that the owners ignored. Approximately 2,500 injured people were rescued from the rubble.

The company and other retailers signed on to the Accord on Factory and Building Safety in Bangladesh. In June 2016, SumOfUs launched a campaign to pressure H&amp;M to honor the commitment they made and signed to protect Bangladesh&#x27;s garment workers. SumOfUs alleged that &quot;H&amp;M is drastically behind schedule in fixing the safety hazards its workers have to face every day.&quot;

==== Phnom Penh, Cambodia ====
On 19 May 2013, a textile factory that produced apparel for H&amp;M in Phnom Penh, Cambodia collapsed, injuring several people. The incident has raised concerns regarding industrial safety regulations.

=== Living wage ===
{{Update section|date=February 2024}}
On 25 November 2013, H&amp;M&#x27;s global head of sustainability committed that H&amp;M, as the world&#x27;s second-largest clothing retailer, would aim to pay all textile workers &quot;living wage&quot; by 2018, stating that governments are responding too slowly to poor working conditions in Bangladesh among other Asian countries where many clothing retailers source a majority if not all of their garments. Wages were increased in Bangladesh from 3,000 takas ($40) to 5,300 takas ($70) a month in late 2013.

=== Fire safety report ===
In September 2015, CleanClothes.org, an NGO involved in garment labor working conditions, reported on a lack of specific fire safety renovations in H&amp;M suppliers&#x27; factories.

=== Xinjiang region ===
In 2020, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute accused 82 major brands, including H&amp;M, of being connected to alleged forced Uyghur labor in Xinjiang. Specifically the report mentions H&amp;M as a customer of Huafu Top Dyed
Melange Yarn Co. Ltd. See also: §Boycotts by China. The evidence adduced was that between April 2017 and June 2018 2,048 Uyghur workers were taken &quot;from Hotan Prefecture in Xinjiang to 15 factories in Anhui Province, including [a] Huafu [factory]&quot;, and that H&amp;M listed Huafu as a supplier.

On 16 September 2020, H&amp;M said it was ending its relationship with Huafu. It further stated that it had &quot;never had a business relationship with a mill owned by the yarn producer Huafu Fashion Co in Anhui province where workers from XUAR have been employed&quot;.

== Controversies ==
=== Boycotts by China ===
In March 2021, after the EU, UK, US, and Canada&#x27;s joint sanctions against China over reports of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, H&amp;M&#x27;s stance on avoiding forced labor in Xinjiang and claim of not going to use cotton produced there was found and criticized by the Communist Youth League of China on its official Weibo page. Their post stated, &quot;Spreading rumors to boycott Xinjiang cotton, while trying to make a profit in China? Wishful thinking!&quot;

The viral post spread across mainland Chinese social media, leading to H&amp;M facing significant criticism among Chinese social media users. On 24 March 2021, H&amp;M became the first fashion brand to be targeted in China, with its products removed from Chinese e-commerce platforms such as Pinduoduo, JD.com and Alibaba, its mobile application removed from Chinese app stores, and rideshare platform DiDi blocking customers from requesting H&amp;M stores as their destinations. Two of H&amp;M&#x27;s brand ambassadors in China, Huang Xuan and Victoria Song, announced they were no longer collaborating with H&amp;M.

In August 2022, H&amp;M resumed sales in China.

==== Response ====
Chinese state media outlet China Global Television Network countered the statements against Xinjiang cotton with a video showing automation in cotton-picking and local Uyghurs claiming that the industry brought high earnings. On 26 March 2021, the United States condemned the China-backed boycotts, with its Department of Commerce stating that the United States &quot;has taken strong actions to stop China from profiting off of its human-rights abuses in Xinjiang and to stop imports of products made with forced labor in China.&quot;

On 31 March, H&amp;M responded with a statement vowing to rebuild trust in China and serve its customers in a &quot;respectful way&quot;. H&amp;M reported sales in China had fallen by approximately 23% for the second quarter of 2021 (compared to the same period in the last fiscal year). According to a report, more than half a million are forced to pick cotton in Xinjiang.

=== Greenwashing claims ===
A proposed class action lawsuit in the US alleged that H&amp;M was greenwashing via the sustainability claims made in its Conscious Choice range. These claims were dismissed. Earlier this year, The Norwegian Consumer Agency (Forbrukertilsynet) said it believed Norrøna is &quot;breaking the law&quot; in marketing clothes as environmentally friendly and issued a warning to H&amp;M GROUP against using the same type of environmental claims.

=== Leaving Russia ===
In March 2022, the H&amp;M Group communicated that they would pause their operations in Russia due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

=== Israel ===
H&amp;M has operated stores in Israel since March 2010 with its first store in Tel Aviv in partnership with local franchisee Match Retail, a division of Union Group. As of December 2023, H&amp;M operates 24 stores in Israel, predominantly around the region of Gush Dan. H&amp;M does not operate any stores in the occupied areas of East Jerusalem or the West Bank.

However, since opening in Israel, the Palestinian branch of BDS has campaigned for boycott of fashion chain, demanding that they pull out of the country. H&amp;M&#x27;s continuing presence in Israel has led to protests in various stores in Europe, especially since the invasion of the Gaza Strip. The company initially closed its stores when the invasion started in October, however the company quietly reopened the stores.

In January 2016, H&amp;M initially put out and later pulled a tallit-like beige and dark blue striped scarf in its Israeli stores, after it was accused of being offensive to Jews.{{Clarify|date=May 2024}}

=== Australia ===
In January 2024, the company was heavily criticized after its Australian branch released a school uniform advertisement with the slogan &quot;Make those heads turn in H&amp;M’s Back to School fashion&quot;. Melinda Tankard Reist, an Australian writer, questioned the brand&#x27;s motives, claiming that young girls just want to be left alone and don&#x27;t want unwelcome attention. The company removed the advertisement and apologized.

===Other controversies===
== Philanthropy ==
Since January 2012 H&amp;M has offered its H&amp;M Design Award, an annual design prize for fashion graduates. The prize is established to support young designers with the beginning of their careers.

<text>Vattenfall is a Swedish multinational power company owned by the Swedish state. Beyond Sweden, the company generates power in Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.

The company&#x27;s name is Swedish for &quot;waterfall&quot;, and is an abbreviation of its original name, Royal Waterfall Board (&quot;Kungliga Vattenfallsstyrelsen&quot;).

==History==
Vattenfall (then called &quot;Kungliga Vattenfallsstyrelsen&quot; or Royal Waterfall Board) was founded in 1909 as a state-owned enterprise in Sweden. From its founding until the mid-1970s, Vattenfall&#x27;s business was largely restricted to Sweden, with a focus on hydroelectric power generation. Only in 1974 did the company begin to build nuclear reactors in Sweden (the Ringhals 1 and 2 reactors), eventually owning seven of Sweden&#x27;s 12 reactors. In 1992, Vattenfall was reformed as the joint-stock company Vattenfall AB. At the same time, the transmission grid (220 kV and 400 kV lines) was transferred to the newly formed state agency Svenska kraftnät, which also became responsible for the operation of the national power system.

In the years 1990 through 2009, Vattenfall expanded considerably (especially into Germany, Poland and the Netherlands), acquiring stakes in Hämeen Sähkö (1996), HEW (1999, 25.1% stake from the city of Hamburg), the Polish heat production company EW (2000, 55% stake), the Danish Elsam A/S (2005, 35.3% stake), and Nuon (2009, 49% stake, today 100%). In 2002, Vattenfall AB and its acquisitions were incorporated as Vattenfall Europe AG, making it the third-largest electricity producer in Germany.

Following the expansion period, Vattenfall started to divest parts of its business in Denmark and Poland during the years following 2009 in a strategy to focus on three core markets: Sweden, Netherlands, and Germany. Write-downs on coal-fired and nuclear power plant assets in Germany and gas power plants in the Netherlands were necessary for a difficult market environment with increasing renewable energy market share and due to the German nuclear power phase-out decision made in 2011. In summer 2013 Vattenfall announced a write-down of the value of its assets by 29.7 billion SEK (US$4.6 billion). A major part of these write-offs were attributed to Nuon Energy NV, a Netherlands-based utility that Vattenfall purchased at an 89 billion SEK (ca. US$15 billion) price in 2009, but whose values were depreciating by 15 billion SEK (ca. US$2 billion) since. The gloomy market outlook of decreasing power prices in combination with increasing risks notably on the continental market prompted the board to revise the group strategy by splitting its organizational structure into a Nordic part and a part with operations in continental Europe and the United Kingdom as of 2014. Some analysts have perceived this strategic review as a precursor to a partial retreat from continental European activities with a shift of focus towards activities in the Scandinavian market. In this context and in response to a local referendum on re-municipilization of distribution grids, Vattenfall agreed on the sale of company-owned electricity and district-heat grids in Hamburg to the City of Hamburg in early 2014. In each of the second quarters of 2015 and 2016, Vattenfall filed impairments of SEK 28 billion, mostly due to lignite power stations in Germany. Operational financials were satisfactory. In 2020, Vattenfall reported a profit of SEK 7,716 billion with an operating profit (EBIT) of SEK 15,276 billion.

Outside of Sweden, Vattenfall is known for forcing the Soviet government to publicly reveal the Chernobyl disaster. The Kremlin had tried to cover up the accident for a day, but elevated radiation levels at Vattenfall&#x27;s Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant forced the Kremlin to admit the accident had occurred.

In October 2020, it was announced that Gunnar Groebler, senior vice president at Vattenfall responsible for the company&#x27;s wind power operations, would leave the organisation to join Salzgitter AG. 

Magnus Hall, President and CEO from October 2014, decided to leave the company in July 2020 and was succeeded by Anna Borg on November 1, 2020.


==Expansion beyond Sweden==

In 2006, Vattenfall began production of the pilot carbon capture and storage (CCS) plant at Schwarze Pumpe, Germany. In 2007, the Lillgrund Wind Farm off the southern coast of Sweden was commissioned and began delivering electricity.

Vattenfall has power generation branches in the core markets Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Denmark, and also has operations in Finland. In Germany, Vattenfall is the electric utility for the states of Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg, Berlin, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, and Saxony.

The company entered the British retail energy market in June 2017, but announced in November 2019 that it is considering to pull out again, citing unfavourable market conditions including strong competition and government-imposed price controls. The company remains one of the largest operators in UK offshore wind and operates the largest onshore windfarm in England and Wales.

==Generation==
As of 2019, renewables accounted for 35% of the firm&#x27;s total generation capacity, including wind, solar and hydro power.

Some of Vattenfall&#x27;s most notable power generation plants include the 110 MW Lillgrund Wind Farm off the coast of Malmö, Sweden, the world&#x27;s largest offshore wind farm of that time at Thanet, UK, the nuclear reactors Brunsbüttel Nuclear Power Plant (67% ownership), Krümmel Nuclear Power Plant (50% ownership), Brokdorf Nuclear Power Plant (20% ownership) in Germany, and the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant and Ringhals Nuclear Power Plant in Sweden. The nuclear power stations of Brunsbüttel and Krümmel have been shut down permanently in response to a governmental order in summer 2011 after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.

Vattenfall also operates biomass and other power plants in Germany and the Netherlands.

===Exit from German lignite coal===

Until 2016, Vattenfall owned several open pit coal mines digging up lignite for Vattenfall lignite power stations, including the Jänschwalde Power Station, the Boxberg Power Station, the Lippendorf Power Station (owned in part) and the Schwarze Pumpe Power Station. In 2014, Vattenfall had a lignite turnover of €2.3 billion and a profit of €647 million, but later lost money on lignite as power prices decreased from 40 to 20 €/MWh. On 30September 2016, Vattenfall completed the sale of its German lignite facilities to the Czech energy group EPH and its financial partner PPF Investments.

===Nuclear generation===
In January 2016, Vattenfall announced that its Swedish nuclear power plants, including the newer reactors, were operating at a loss due to low electricity prices and Sweden&#x27;s nuclear output tax. It warned that if it was forced to shut the plants down, there would be serious consequences to Sweden&#x27;s electricity supply, and argued that the nuclear output tax should be scrapped.

In October 2016 Vattenfall began litigation against the German government for its 2011 decision to accelerate the phase-out of nuclear power. Hearings are taking place at the World Bank&#x27;s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) in Washington, D.C. and Vattenfall is claiming almost €4.7billion in damages. The German government regards the action as &quot;inadmissible and unfounded&quot;. 

In March 2021 the German government agreed to a settlement which resulted in €1.425 billion being paid to Vattenfall as part of a larger compensation package for all the utility companies impacted.

=== Carbon intensity ===

==Distribution==

Vattenfall dominates the electrical distribution in 60 municipalities in Sweden. Other major grid companies include Ellevio (formerly Fortum) and E.ON.

==Car seatbelt==
Vattenfall played a vital early role in the development of the seat belt, developing a two-point seatbelt which became the direct precursor to the modern three-point seatbelt. 

Fatal car accidents were rapidly increasing in Sweden during the 1950s. When a study at Vattenfall of accidents among employees revealed that the majority of casualties came from car accidents. Vattenfall talked to vehicle manufacturers, including Volvo and Saab who provided them with cars, suggesting using seat belts for better safety, however, the manufacturers were unenthusiastic, believing that seat belts might make drivers think that driving a car was dangerous.

In light of this, two Vattenfall engineers, Bengt Odelgard and Per-Olof Weman, started to develop a safety belt. This development work let to the creation of a diagonal seat belt, known as the &#x27;Vattenfall seat belt&#x27; to be used in their vehicles. Until the mid 1960s, this was the standard seatbelt in Sweden and various countries in Europe. Their work set the standard for safety belts in cars worldwide and was presented to Volvo in the late 1950s, who went on to develop the idea into the three-point safety belt. 

==Criticism==
Vattenfall&#x27;s past expansion strategy has involved the acquisition of multiple brown coal (lignite)-fired power plants, which has been highly controversial in Sweden and Germany due to the fact that brown coal is among the most carbon-intensive forms of electricity generation. In addition, brown coal is strip mined in a process that sometimes forces communities to relocate as mining fields expand. Vattenfall sold its brown coal assets in September 2016 to Czech investor EPH .

In May 2009, campaign group Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO) launched the Climate Greenwash Awards, declaring Vattenfall the inaugural winner for portraying itself as a climate champion while lobbying to continue business as usual. Vattenfall owns (or has owned) four of the &quot;dirty thirty&quot; most polluting power stations in Europe, a list compiled by WWF and other organizations.

A fire in the transformer of the nuclear power plant Krümmel (partly owned with E.ON) in 2007 forced a closure of the power plant for over two years, while a short circuit in July 2009 in another transformer led to another closure. Due to these incidents the Prime Minister of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, Peter Harry Carstensen announced that this will be &quot;letzter Versuch&quot; (their last try) before complete closure of the facility.

Vattenfall has been accused of skirting the line of illegality in its effort to maintain ownership of electrical power grids. Most recently, Vattenfall&#x27;s efforts to maintain ownership of Hamburg&#x27;s power grid by lobbying the ruling SPD have drawn criticism.

In Germany, the &quot;Berlin Energy Table&quot; (Berliner Energietisch) alliance united a number of NGOs and local groups initiating a Referendum on the recommunalization of energy supply in Berlin. The referendum took place on November 3, 2013, yet slightly missed the quorum. However, the Senate of Berlin promised to match the citizens&#x27; initiative&#x27;s key claim, regardless of the referendum&#x27;s outcome: to transfer all end-user operations, which were owned by Vattenfall at the time, to a public utility company. The company was founded in 2014 as &quot;Berliner Stadtwerke.&quot;

<text>Rails (avian family Rallidae) are a large, cosmopolitan family of small- to medium-sized terrestrial and/or semi-amphibious birds. The family exhibits considerable diversity in its forms, and includes such ubiquitous species as the crakes, coots, and gallinule; other rail species are extremely rare or endangered. Many are associated with wetland habitats, some being semi-aquatic like waterfowl (such as the coot), but many more are wading birds or shorebirds. The ideal rail habitats are marsh areas, including rice paddies, and flooded fields or open forest. They are especially fond of dense vegetation for nesting. The rail family is found in every terrestrial habitat with the exception of dry desert, polar or freezing regions, and alpine areas (above the snow line). Members of Rallidae occur on every continent except Antarctica. Numerous unique island species are known.

==Name==
&quot;Rail&quot; is the anglicized respelling of the French &quot;râle&quot;, from Old French &quot;rasle&quot;. It is named from its harsh cry, in Vulgar Latin *&quot;rascula&quot;, from Latin &quot;rādere&quot; (&quot;to scrape&quot;).

==Morphology==

The rails are a family of small to medium-sized, ground-living birds. They vary in length from and in weight from . Some species have long necks and in many cases are laterally compressed.

The bill is the most variable feature within the family. In some species, it is longer than the head (like the clapper rail of the Americas); in others, it may be short and wide (as in the coots), or massive (as in the purple gallinules). A few coots and gallinules have a frontal shield, which is a fleshy, rearward extension of the upper bill. The most complex frontal shield is found in the horned coot.

Rails exhibit very little sexual dimorphism in either plumage or size. Two exceptions are the watercock (&quot;Gallicrex cinerea&quot;) and the little crake (&quot;Zapornia parva&quot;).

===Flight and flightlessness===
The wings of all rails are short and rounded. The flight of those Rallidae able to fly, while not powerful, can be sustained for long periods of time, and many species migrate annually. The weakness of their flight, however, means they are easily blown off course, thus making them common vagrants, a characteristic that has led them to colonize many isolated oceanic islands. Furthermore, these birds often prefer to run rather than fly, especially in dense habitat. Some are also flightless at some time during their moult periods.

Flightlessness in rails is one of the best examples of parallel evolution in the animal kingdom. Of the roughly 150 historically known rail species, 31 extant or recently extinct species evolved flightlessness from volant (flying) ancestors. This process created the endemic populations of flightless rails seen on Pacific islands today.

Many island rails are flightless because small island habitats without mammalian predators eliminate the need to fly or move long distances. Flight makes intense demands, with the keel and flight muscles taking up to 40% of a bird&#x27;s weight. Reducing the flight muscles, with a corresponding lowering of metabolic demands, reduces the flightless rail&#x27;s energy expenditures. For this reason, flightlessness makes it easier to survive and colonize an island where resources may be limited. This also allows for the evolution of multiple sizes of flightless rails on the same island as the birds diversify to fill niches.

In addition to energy conservation, certain morphological traits also affect rail evolution. Rails have relatively small flight muscles and wings to begin with. In rails, the flight muscles make up only 12–17% of their overall body mass. This, in combination with their terrestrial habits and behavioral flightlessness, is a significant contributor to the rail&#x27;s remarkably fast loss of flight; as few as 125,000 years were needed for the Laysan rail to lose the power of flight and evolve the reduced, stubby wings only useful to keep balance when running quickly. Indeed, some argue that measuring the evolution of flightlessness in rails in generations rather than millennia might be possible.

Another factor that contributes to the occurrence of the flightless state is a climate that does not necessitate seasonal long-distance migration; this is evidenced by the tendency to evolve flightlessness at a much greater occurrence in tropical islands than in temperate or polar islands.

It is paradoxical, since rails appear loath to fly, that the evolution of flightless rails would necessitate high dispersal to isolated islands. Nonetheless, three species of small-massed rails, &quot;Gallirallus philippensis&quot;, &quot;Porphyrio porphyrio&quot;, and &quot;Porzana tabuensis&quot;, exhibit a persistently high ability to disperse long distances among tropic Pacific islands, though only the latter two gave rise to flightless endemic species throughout the Pacific Basin. In examining the phylogeny of &quot;G. philippensis&quot;, although the species is clearly polyphyletic (it has more than one ancestral species), it is not the ancestor of most of its flightless descendants, revealing that the flightless condition evolved in rails before speciation was complete.

A consequence of lowered energy expenditure in flightless island rails has also been associated with evolution of their &quot;tolerance&quot; and &quot;approachability&quot;. For example, the (non-Rallidae) Corsican blue tits exhibit lower aggression and reduced territorial defense behaviors than do their mainland European counterparts, but this tolerance may be limited to close relatives. The resulting kin-selecting altruistic phenomena reallocate resources to produce fewer young that are more competitive and would benefit the population as an entirety, rather than many young that would exhibit less fitness. Unfortunately, with the human occupation of most islands in the past 5,000 to 35,000 years, selection has undoubtedly reversed the tolerance into a wariness of humans and predators, causing species unequipped for the change to become susceptible to extinction.

==Behaviour and ecology==
In general, members of the Rallidae are omnivorous generalists. Many species eat invertebrates, as well as fruit or seedlings. A few species are primarily herbivorous. The calls of Rallidae species vary and are often quite loud. Some are whistle-like or squeak-like, while others seem unbirdlike. Loud calls are useful in dense vegetation, or at night where seeing another member of the species is difficult. Some calls are territorial.

The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. Reed beds are a particularly favoured habitat. Those that migrate do so at night.

Most nest in dense vegetation. In general, they are shy, secretive, and difficult to observe. Most species walk and run vigorously on strong legs, and have long toes that are well adapted to soft, uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings, and although they are generally weak fliers, they are, nevertheless, capable of covering long distances. Island species often become flightless, and many of them are now extinct following the introduction of terrestrial predators such as cats, foxes, weasels, mongooses, rats, and pigs.

Many reedbed species are secretive (apart from loud calls), crepuscular, and have laterally flattened bodies. In the Old World, long-billed species tend to be called rails and short-billed species crakes. North American species are normally called rails irrespective of bill length. The smallest of these is Swinhoe&#x27;s rail, at and 25 g. The larger species are also sometimes given other names. The black coots are more adapted to open water than their relatives, and some other large species are called gallinules and swamphens. The largest of this group is the takahē, at and .

The rails have suffered disproportionally from human changes to the environment, and an estimated several hundred species of island rails have become extinct because of this. Several island species of rails remain endangered, and conservation organisations and governments continue to work to prevent their extinction.

===Reproduction===
The breeding behaviors of many Rallidae species are poorly understood or unknown. Most are thought to be monogamous, although polygyny and polyandry have been reported. Most often, they lay five to 10 eggs. Clutches as small as one or as large as 15 eggs are known. Egg clutches may not always hatch at the same time. Chicks become mobile after a few days. They often depend on their parents until fledging, which happens around 1 month old.

==Rallidae and humans==
Some larger, more abundant rails are hunted and their eggs collected for food. The Wake Island rail was hunted to extinction by the starving Japanese garrison after the island was cut off from supply during World War II. At least two species, the common moorhen and the American purple gallinule, have been considered pests.

===Threats and conservation===
Due to their tendencies towards flightlessness, many island species have been unable to cope with introduced species. The most dramatic human-caused extinctions occurred in the Pacific Ocean as people colonised the islands of Melanesia, Polynesia, and Micronesia, during which an estimated 750–1800 species of birds became extinct, half of which were rails. Some species that came close to extinction, such as the Lord Howe woodhen, and the takahē, have made modest recoveries due to the efforts of conservation organisations. The Guam rail came perilously close to extinction when brown tree snakes were introduced to Guam, but some of the last remaining individuals were taken into captivity and are breeding well, though attempts at reintroduction have met with mixed results.

==Systematics and evolution==
The family Rallidae was introduced (as Rallia) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815.
The family has traditionally been grouped with two families of larger birds, the cranes and bustards, as well as several smaller families of usually &quot;primitive&quot; midsized amphibious birds, to make up the order Gruiformes. The alternative Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, which has been widely accepted in America, raises the family to ordinal level as the Ralliformes. Given uncertainty about gruiform monophyly, this may or may not be correct; it certainly seems more justified than most of the Sibley-Ahlquist proposals. However, such a group would probably also include the Heliornithidae (finfoots and sungrebes), an exclusively tropical group that is somewhat convergent with grebes, and usually united with the rails in the Ralli.

The cladogram below showing the phylogeny of the living and recently extinct Rallidae is based on a study by Juan Garcia-R and collaborators published in 2020. The genera and number of species are taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). The names of the subfamilies and tribes are those proposed by Jeremy Kirchman and collaborators in 2021.

The undescribed Fernando de Noronha rail, genus and species undetermined, survived to historic times. The extinct genus &quot;Nesotrochis&quot; from the Greater Antilles was formerly considered to be a rail, but based on DNA evidence is now known to be an independent lineage of gruiform more closely related to Sarothruridae and adzebills.

<doc id="206413" wikidata="Q2723567" url="?curid=206413" title="John Gibson Lockhart">
<text>John Gibson Lockhart (12 June 1794 – 25 November 1854) was a Scottish writer and editor. He is best known as the author of the seminal, and much-admired, seven-volume biography of his father-in-law Sir Walter Scott: &quot;Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart&quot;. He produced four novels in the early 1820s including &quot;Adam Blair&quot; and &quot;Reginald Dalton&quot;.

==Early years==
Lockhart was born on 12 June 1794 in the manse of Cambusnethan House in Lanarkshire to Dr John Lockhart, who transferred in 1796 to Glasgow, and was appointed minister in the Presbyterian Church of Scotland, and his second wife Elizabeth Gibson (1767–1834), daughter of Margaret Mary Pringle and Reverend John Gibson, minister of St Cuthbert&#x27;s, Edinburgh.

He was the younger paternal half-brother of the politician William Lockhart.

Lockhart attended Glasgow High School, where he showed himself clever rather than industrious. He fell into ill-health, and had to be removed from school before he was 12; but on his recovery he was sent at this early age to the University of Glasgow, and displayed so much precocious learning, especially in Greek, that he was offered a Snell exhibition at Oxford. He was not yet 14 when he entered Balliol College, Oxford, where he acquired a great store of knowledge outside the regular curriculum. He read French, Italian, German and Spanish, was interested in antiquities, and became versed in heraldic and genealogical lore.

==&quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and a literary duel==

In 1813, Lockhart took a first in classics then, for two years after leaving Oxford, lived in Glasgow before settling to the study of Scots law at the University of Edinburgh where, in 1816, he was elected to the Faculty of Advocates. A tour on the continent in 1817, when he visited Goethe at Weimar, was made possible when he was hired by the publisher William Blackwood to translate Friedrich Schlegel&#x27;s &quot;Lectures on the History of Literature&quot;.

Edinburgh was then the stronghold of the Whig party, whose organ was the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;; and it was not until 1817 that the Scottish Tories found a means of expression in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. After changing its name following a hum-drum launch as the &quot;Edinburgh Monthly Magazine&quot;, &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot; suddenly electrified Edinburgh with an outburst of brilliant criticism. Lockhart (along with John Wilson (Christopher North)), had joined its staff upon his return from Europe in 1817, and contributed to the caustic and aggressive articles that marked the early years of &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot;. Lockhart wrote virulent articles on &quot;The Cockney School of Poetry&quot; of Leigh Hunt, Keats and their contemporaries, although he did show appreciation of Coleridge and Wordsworth, and he praised Percy Bysshe Shelley, calling him &quot;a man of genius&quot;.

One of the main literary organs of the Cockney School was &quot;The London Magazine&quot;. Its editor, John Scott, felt that &quot;Blackwood’s&quot; hounding of Keats had contributed to his 1821 death, at age 25. Scott also felt it was his duty to defend his authors against Lockhart and &quot;Blackwood’s&quot;. To that end, he published an attack of Lockhart and &quot;Blackwood’s&quot;; Lockhart promptly asked a London friend, Jonathan Henry Christie, to visit Scott and demand an apology. Scott refused; a series of letters were exchanged and the argument evolved into Scott’s insistence that Lockhart admit that he (Lockhart) was, in fact, the anonymous editor of &quot;Blackwood’s&quot; (it was common practice at the time to act an editor, and/or as a writer, anonymously, or using a pseudonym). According to the papers of Scott’s friend Peter George Patmore, who tried to negotiate a truce and kept a meticulous record of the matter, not only did Lockhart refuse to admit to his editorship, but he responded with &quot;abusive epithets&quot;. With both men seeing their honour at stake, there was no going back and, on 16 February 1821, they proceeded with the duel near the Chalk Farm Tavern. But Lockhart did not attend; Jonathan Christie stepped into his place with his friend, James Traill, as his second. John Scott was wounded and died ten days later. Christie and Traill were tried for murder. They were acquitted, but Christie’s life was ruined. Lockhart was not blamed.

==Literary contributions==
Between 1818 and 1825 Lockhart worked indefatigably. In 1819 &quot;Peter&#x27;s Letters to his Kinsfolk&quot; appeared, and in 1822 he edited Peter Motteux&#x27;s edition of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, to which he prefixed a life of author Miguel de Cervantes. Four novels followed: &quot;Valerius&quot; in 1821, &quot;Adam Blair&quot; in 1822, &quot;Reginald Dalton&quot; in 1823 and &quot;Matthew Wald&quot; in 1824. However, his strength did not lie in novel writing. He also contributed to &quot;Blackwood&quot; translations of Spanish ballads, which in 1823 were published separately.

In 1825 Lockhart acted as an agent on behalf of the Faculty of Advocates to purchase the Astorga Collection. The collection is now housed at the National Library of Scotland.

In 1825 Lockhart accepted the editorship of the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, which had been in the hands of Sir John Taylor Coleridge since William Gifford&#x27;s resignation in 1824.
At this time he was living at 25 Northumberland Street in Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town. In 1825 he sold the house to Andrew and George Combe.

As the next heir to the Scotland property belonging to his unmarried half-brother, Milton Lockhart, he was sufficiently independent. In London he had social success, and was recognised as an editor. He contributed largely to the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; himself, particularly biographical articles. He showed the old, railing spirit in an article in the &quot;Quarterly&quot; against Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Poems&quot; of 1833. He continued to write for &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot;, producing for &quot;Constable&#x27;s Miscellany&quot; Vol. XXIII in 1828 a controversial &quot;Life&quot; of Robert Burns. Snyder wrote of it, &quot;The best that one can say of it today...is that it occasioned Carlyle&#x27;s review. It is inexcusably inaccurate from beginning to end, at times demonstrably mendacious, and should never be trusted in any respect or detail.&quot;

==Later works==
Lockhart undertook the editorial supervision of &quot;Murray&#x27;s Family Library&quot;, which he opened in 1829 with a &quot;History of Napoleon&quot;.

However, his major work, and the one for which he is known, is the &quot;Life of Sir Walter Scott&quot; (7 vols, 1837–1838; 2nd edition, 10 vols., 1839). This biography included the publishing of a great number of Scott&#x27;s letters. Thomas Carlyle assessed it in a criticism contributed to the &quot;London and Westminster Review&quot; (1837). Lockhart&#x27;s account of the business transactions between Scott and the Ballantynes and Constable caused an outcry; and in the discussion that followed he showed bitterness in his pamphlet &quot;The Ballantyne Humbug handled&quot;. The &quot;Life of Scott&quot; has been called, after Boswell&#x27;s &quot;Life of Samuel Johnson&quot;, the most admirable biography in the English language. The proceeds, which were considerable, Lockhart resigned for the benefit of Scott&#x27;s creditors.

==Family and final years==

In 1818, Lockhart met Sir Walter Scott, who introduced him to his family. Lockhart married Scott&#x27;s eldest daughter Sophia in April 1820. It was a happy marriage, with winters spent in Edinburgh and summers at Chiefswood, a cottage on Scott&#x27;s Abbotsford estate, where the Lockhart&#x27;s first child John Hugh ‘Johnnie’ was born. John Hugh was born with spina bifida and spent much of his time with his grandfather, listening to Scott’s stories about Scottish history, hence Scott’s book, &quot;Tales of a Grandfather&quot;. Johnnie died in 1831, at age eleven. 

The Lockharts experienced many personal losses. A baby girl died soon after birth. Sir Walter died in 1832 and in 1837, Sophia died suddenly, at age 38. Lockhart also struggled with the loss of his parents and sister. His third child was Walter Scott Lockhart, who became an army officer, but fell into bad company, ruined his health, and died in his father’s arms in January 1853 at the age of 26. Lockhart became seriously depressed, almost starving himself to death. He resigned his editorship of the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; and spent some time in Italy, but returned without recovering his health.

He moved back to Scotland to live with his only surviving child Charlotte, who was settled at Abbotsford with her husband James Hope-Scott, grandson of the 2nd Earl of Hopetoun. The two had converted to Catholicism, which made for an uncomfortable atmosphere in the home (Charlotte would die in childbirth in 1858, at age 30). Lockhart died a few weeks after his arrival at Abbotsford, on 25 November 1854. He was buried at Dryburgh Abbey, beside his son and father-in-law. 

His obituary in &quot;The Times&quot;, dated 9 December 1854, included the paragraph &quot;Endowed with the very highest order of manly beauty, both of features and expression, he retained the brilliancy of youth and a stately strength of person comparatively unimpaired in ripened life; and then, though sorrow and sickness suddenly brought on a premature old age which none could witness unmoved, yet the beauty of the head and of the bearing so far gained in melancholy loftiness of expression what they lost in animation, that the last phase, whether to the eye of painter or of anxious friend, seemed always the finest.&quot;

==Freemasonry==
Like his father-in-law he was a Freemason although he was initiated in a different Edinburgh Lodge – Lodge Canongate Kilwinning, No. 2, on 26 January 1826.

==Legacy==
Robert Scott Lauder painted two portraits of Lockhart, one of him alone, and the other with Charlotte Scott.

The composer Hubert Parry set a modified version of the second half of Lockhart&#x27;s poem &#x27;Beyond&#x27; to music, &quot;&quot; as the fourth of his collection of six choral motets, &quot;Songs of Farewell&quot;. The pieces were first performed at a concert at the Royal College of Music on 22 May 1916. The song/poem was later sung at the composer&#x27;s funeral in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 23 February 1919.

<text>Archibald David Constable (24 February 1774 – 21 July 1827) was a Scottish publisher, bookseller and stationer.

==Life==

Constable was born at Carnbee, Fife, son of the land steward to the Earl of Kellie.

In 1788 Archibald was apprenticed to Peter Hill, an Edinburgh bookseller, based on the High Street south of the Mercat Cross. In 1795 Constable started in business for himself as a dealer in rare books, taking a unit immediately opposite Peter Hill, on the north side of the Mercat Cross. He was then living in a house in Calton village on the edge of Calton Hill.

He bought the rights to publish the &quot;Scots Magazine&quot; in 1801, and John Leyden, the orientalist, became its editor. In 1800 Constable began the &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and in November 1802 he issued the first number of the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, under the nominal editorship of Sydney Smith; Lord Jeffrey, was, however, the guiding spirit of the review, having as his associates Lord Brougham, Sir Walter Scott, Henry Hallam, John Playfair and afterwards Lord Macaulay.

In 1802 he published &quot;Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border&quot; by Walter Scott and continued a lifelong friendship with Scott from at least this point. Walter Scott was primarily an advocate, and the Edinburgh courts were only 100m from Constable&#x27;s shop.

From at least 1809 his head clerk Robert Cadell had a financial interest in the firm and in 1811 he replaced Hunter of Blackness as a partner, and from 1812 was sole partner with Constable.

Constable made a new departure in publishing by the generosity of his terms to authors. Writers for the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; were paid at an unprecedented rate, and Constable offered Scott 1000 guineas in advance for &quot;Marmion&quot;. In 1804 A. G. Hunter of Blackness joined Constable as partner, bringing considerable capital into the firm, which thereafter was styled Archibald Constable &amp; Co. In 1805, jointly with Longman &amp; Co., Constable published Scott&#x27;s &quot;Lay of the Last Minstrel&quot;, and in 1807 &quot;Marmion&quot;. He also published four of James Hogg&#x27;s books, &quot;The Mountain Bard&quot; (1807), &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Guide&quot; (1807), &quot;The Forest Minstrel&quot; (1810) and &quot;Poetical Works&quot; (1822).

In 1808 a split took place between Constable and Sir Walter Scott, who transferred his business to the publishing firm of John Ballantyne &amp; Co., for which he supplied most of the capital. In 1813, however, a reconciliation took place. Ballantyne was in difficulties, and Constable again became Scott&#x27;s publisher, a condition being that the firm of John Ballantyne &amp; Co. should be wound up at an early date, though Scott retained his interest in the printing business of James Ballantyne &amp; Co. Around 1810 he bought a house at the head of Craigs Close, nearby his shop. The premises was previously the house of William Creech and historically had been the home of Andro Hart. The printworks linked to this house seem to have been leased by Constable since around 1800.

In 1808 he served as Moderator of the High Constables of Edinburgh. 

In 1812 Constable, who had admitted Robert Cathcart and Robert Cadell as partners on Hunter&#x27;s retirement, purchased the copyright of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, adding the supplement (6 vols, 1816-1824) to the 4th, 5th and 6th editions. In 1814 he bought the copyright of &quot;Waverley&quot;. This was issued anonymously; but in a short time 12,000 copies were disposed of, Scott&#x27;s other novels following in quick succession. The firm also published the &quot;Annual Register&quot;.

Constable played a key role in the 1825 purchase of the Astorga Collection by the library of the Faculty of Advocates. The collection, comprising 3,716 pre-1800 volumes which ones belonged to Spain&#x27;s 14th Marquis of Astorga, is now held by the National Library of Scotland. 

Through over-speculation, complications arose, and in 1826 a financial crash occurred. Constable&#x27;s London agents stopped payment, leading to his failure for over £250,000. James Ballantyne &amp; Co. also went bankrupt, owing nearly £90,000. The collapse of both firms had a significant impact on Sir Walter Scott.

Constable started business afresh, and began in 1827 &quot;Constable&#x27;s Miscellany of Original and Selected Works&quot; consisting of a series of original works, and of standard books republished in a cheap form, thus making one of the earliest and most famous attempts to popularize high-quality literature.
Constable died of dropsy (which had plagued him for several years) at home, 3 Park Place in Edinburgh, on 21 July 1827, but his firm survived, and the Constable publishing business continued in the twentieth century, issuing a wide range of fiction and non-fiction books. It continues today as Constable &amp; Robinson.

Park Place was a small square north of George Square which was demolished later in the 19th century to build the new medical buildings for Edinburgh University.

==Family==
Constable was first married to Mary Willison (d.1814) daughter of David Willison, a rival Edinburgh printer. They lived in Craigcrook Castle in western Edinburgh. Among their children were a son, Thomas, and a daughter, Elizabeth.

Their son, Thomas Constable FRSE (1812-1881) took over his printing business on his father&#x27;s death. In 1839 he was appointed printer and publisher in Edinburgh to Queen Victoria, and issued, among other notable series, &quot;Constable&#x27;s Educational Series&quot;, and &quot;Constable&#x27;s Foreign Miscellany&quot;.

After Mary&#x27;s death, Constable remarried in 1818, to Charlotte Neale, daughter of John Neale.

Thomas Constable married Lucia Anne Cowan, daughter of Alexander Cowan, an Edinburgh paper-maker (who clearly would have had business links with a major publishing firm such as Constables). They lived at 11 Thistle Street in Edinburgh&#x27;s First New Town. Their son was also Archibald David Constable FRSE LLD (1843-1915), named after his grandfather, and followed in the family tradition as a printer. In 1865 he became a partner in the firm, and when Thomas retired in 1893 the firm continued under the name of T. &amp; A. Constable.

Their daughter, Elizabeth Constable (d.1818) married his junior publishing partner, Robert Cadell of Ratho.

<doc id="206419" wikidata="Q662174" url="?curid=206419" title="Securitas AB">
<text>Securitas AB is a Swedish group devoted to security services, such as security guarding, mobile patrolling, monitoring, investigation and related consulting services. The group is headquartered in Stockholm and had over 300,000 employees in 53 countries worldwide as of 2016. Securitas AB is listed at Nasdaq OMX Stockholm in the Large Cap segment.

Securitas AB owns and operates the Swiss security company Protectas AG in Switzerland, where there is a pre-existing, separate security company called Securitas AG, part of the Swiss Securitas Group.

Since 1999, Securitas AB has been the parent company of Pinkerton, a historically significant American detective agency.

== History ==

Securitas AB was founded in 1934 in Helsingborg, Sweden, as AB Hälsingborgs Nattvakt, when Erik Philip-Sörensen bought a small guarding company. In 1935, the name was changed to Förenade Svenska Vakt AB. The company expanded through acquisitions of several small security companies, initially in southern Sweden.

In 1949, AB Securitas Alarm was founded as the company&#x27;s security technology subsidiary, and during the following decade, the company started expanding internationally.

In 1972, the group was rebranded as Securitas, the Roman goddess of security and stability, with a logotype consisting of three red dots and the word &quot;Securitas.&quot; The dots are described as representing the group&#x27;s core values of &quot;Integrity, Vigilance, and Helpfulness.&quot;

In 1976, Erik Philip-Sörensen sold the Securitas group to his sons Jörgen Philip-Sörensen and Sven Philip-Sörensen, and in 1981, the group was divided between the sons, with the international operations developing into Group 4 and the Swedish operations retaining the Securitas brand.

In 1983, Securitas was sold to the holding company Skrinet, and in 1985, it was acquired by Investment AB Latour, controlled by Gustaf Douglas. Under the new ownership, the group focused on security, and in 1989, an international expansion began with acquisitions in Norway, Denmark, and Portugal and the establishment of Hungary.

In 1991, Securitas was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. In 1994, the group distributed ASSA AB (acquired in 1988) to its shareholders. Throughout the 1990s, foreign acquisitions were made in eleven European countries and in the United States.

In February 1999, Securitas acquired Pinkerton and in August 2000, Burns Security and several regional security companies in the United States. These acquisitions made Securitas one of the largest security companies in the world. In 2001, a new organization took effect, with five business areas according to the types of services offered, and Loomis Fargo &amp; Company was acquired.

In 2003, the group&#x27;s security services in the United States were integrated under the Securitas brand, and the group&#x27;s cash handling services were completely divisionalized, with joint management for United States and European operations.

In 2006, Marie Ehrling was elected Chairman of the Securitas board of directors.

Also in 2006, the divisions Securitas Systems (alarm, monitoring, and access control systems) and Securitas Direct (solutions for homes and small businesses) were distributed to the group&#x27;s shareholders and listed at the Stockholm Stock Exchange. In the same year, the divisions Mobile (small and medium-sized customers) and Alert Services (electronic surveillance of homes and businesses) were created (as of 2007, constituting the business segment Mobile and Monitoring). Securitas Direct was later renamed to Verisure in all countries except Spain and Portugal.

In November 2007, the United Kingdom cash handling services of the division Loomis were sold to Vaultex Ltd., owned by HSBC and Barclays. Securitas began operating in Peru in November 2007. In 2008, the division Loomis (cash handling) was distributed to the group&#x27;s shareholders and listed at Nasdaq OMX Stockholm.

In September 2010, Securitas acquired the security-services operations of Reliance Security Group in the United Kingdom. In November 2011, Securitas acquired Chubb Security Personnel in the United Kingdom.

As of 2012, Securitas was present in 53 countries and territories.

In 2013, Securitas acquired Pinkerton Government Services, which provides cleared security services to governmental agencies and programs that require a Department of Defense or Department of Energy security clearance. This government services division of Securitas became known as Securitas Critical Infrastructure Services. This division operates both in the United States and worldwide when cleared services are needed overseas.

In October 2015, Securitas acquired Diebold Incorporated&#x27;s (NYSE-DBD) Electronic Security business in North America. Diebold&#x27;s North American Electronic Security business, based in Green, Ohio, United States, is the third largest commercial electronic security provider in North America. Diebold&#x27;s North American Electronic Security business has approximately 1,100 employees. The operation includes more than 55,000 monitored customer locations and 200,000 sites serviced.

In March 2022, Securitas partnered with Citizen to trial a version of Citizen&#x27;s on-demand private security service in Chicago.

On July 22, 2022, Securitas purchased Stanley Security Solutions, which included Stanley Healthcare, from the American company Stanley Black &amp; Decker. The brands were renamed Securitas Technology and Securitas Healthcare, respectively. The initial agreement was signed on December 8, 2021

=== Controversies ===

==== Murder of Cassie Heppner ====
In February 2020, American Securitas officer Robert Pavao murdered Timberland employee Cassie Heppner at Timberland&#x27;s corporate headquarters in Stratham, New Hampshire, where Pavao was contracted to. Pavao was found guilty of second degree homicide and sentenced to 55 years in prison for the crime.

==== Suspension for Harvard union protest ====
In January 2022, an American Securitas officer contracted to Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Walter J. Terzano, was suspended for protesting during a contentious union contract negotiation between Securitas and the Service Employees International Union. Terzano created protest signs and attempted to get other Securitas officers to protest outside the home of University President Lawrence Bacow. A complaint was made to Securitas by Harvard&#x27;s director of facilities and maintenance, leading to the suspension. The National Labor Relations Board ruled that Securitas had unlawfully retaliated against Terzano.

==== Sex scandal ====
In 2010, the chief executive of Securitas was arrested for buying sexual services from a prostitute in Stockholm. He was convicted in 2012. The company said it would put an end to the misogynistic and sexist culture that prevailed in the company.

In 2022, A Swedish TV documentary exposed two employees who paid for sex during work trips and were suspected of having bribed employees of the city of Malmö. The company fired them.

== Operations ==

Securitas is divided into three main business segments, &quot;Security Services North America,&quot; &quot;Security Services Europe,&quot; and &quot;Security Services Ibero-America.&quot; Operations outside of the Americas and Europe are reported in a separate category called &quot;Other,&quot; which also includes central expenses.

In general, the group operates under the brand Securitas for all business segments. However, sales to consumers are made under the Verisure brand in all countries except Spain and Portugal. Specialized services including due diligence, background checks, security assessments, brand protection, intellectual property protection, executive protection, investigations, cyber surveillance, computer forensics, social compliance and IT security are performed worldwide under the brand &quot;Pinkerton.&quot;

These operations are reported as part of the North American business segment. There are three operations centers in North America: Toronto, Ontario, Parsippany, New Jersey and Westlake Village, California. The Swiss market is an exception to the name, in that general security services are provided under the brand Protectas.

=== On-site Guarding ===
Securitas&#x27; primary operations are their on-site security and guarding services. Through their on-site guarding division, Securitas provides on-site security officers in various roles. Most commonly Securitas officers are hired for standing rolls, reception, patrol, and vehicle patrol. Specialty assignments can also include fire-watch, fire extinguisher testing, access control and badging, console operations, safety auditing, alarm &amp; emergency response, and what Securitas refers to as &quot;customized and site-specific security tasks&quot;. Additionally, Securitas offers special event security services, primarily for concerts and sporting events.

=== Mobile patrol ===
Securitas operates a mobile patrol division, which they refer to as &quot;mobile guarding&quot;. Businesses wanting security but not needing full time guards can subscribe to a mobile patrol service where officers will patrol the property one to a few times a night. The subscription also includes incident response services for security concerns occurring when an officer is not currently on-site.

=== Remote guarding ===
Remote Guarding services involve Securitas officers monitoring a customer&#x27;s site from an off-site command center. If suspicious activity is noticed, Securitas can use speakers to talk to people on-site as well as notify the police or other emergency services when necessary. Mobile patrol officers are also often used to respond to incidents discovered by a remote guarding officer. Securitas also offers remote escort services that involve an off-site officer watching an employee walk to or from their vehicle.

=== Securitas Technology ===
Securitas Technology, which includes Securitas Healthcare, primarily provides locks, fire sensors, security cameras, and similar hardware. They also provide the software used to monitor this hardware. Additionally, Securitas Technology provides computer security software to protect hardware, software, or electronic data.

=== Risk Management &amp; Private Investigations ===

Securitas&#x27; corporate risk management and investigations services are provided by their subsidiary Pinkerton.

<text>Skanska AB () is a multinational construction and development company based in Sweden. It was established in 1887 as a concrete product manufacturer.

== History ==
Aktiebolaget Skånska Cementgjuteriet (Scanian Cement Casting Ltd) was established in Malmö, Sweden, in 1887 by Rudolf Fredrik Berg and started by manufacturing concrete products. It quickly diversified into a construction company and within ten years the company received its first international order. The company played an important role in building Sweden&#x27;s infrastructure including its roads, power plants, offices and housing.

Growth in Sweden was followed by international expansion. In the mid-1950s Skånska Cementgjuteriet made a major move into international markets. During the next decades, it entered South America, Africa and Asia, and in 1971 the United States market, where it today ranks among the largest in its sector. The company was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange A-list in 1965. In 1984, the name &quot;Skanska,&quot; already in general use internationally, became the group&#x27;s official name.

During the latter part of the 1990s, Skanska expanded substantially both organically and by acquisition. In August 2000, it bought the construction division of Kvaerner.

In mid-2004, Skanska decided to divest its Asian investments and sold its Indian subsidiary to the Thailand based construction firm Italian Thai Development Company.

In 2011, Skanska acquired Industrial Contractors, Inc of Evansville, Indiana, United States.

== Operations ==
Skanska divides its operations into four business streams:

Construction is the largest business stream by revenue and number of employees. The operations of the other business streams involve investments in projects that are developed and later divested. With regard to infrastructure development, this often involves public–private partnerships (PPP). Geographically, the group operates based on local business units. 

=== Skanska USA ===
Skanska established its presence in the United States through acquisitions of established local companies. The legacy company names were initially cobranded (ex. Slattery-Skanska). In 2007, Skanska introduced a plan to integrate and rebrand the majority of the acquired entities under the Skanska USA banners. Entities were united by business sector, geographic region, and district. Three regions were formed: Northeast, Southeast, and Western. 

=== Environment ===

Skanska was the No. 1 &quot;Green Builder&quot; in the United States in 2007 and was ranked No. 3 &quot;Green Contractor&quot; in the United States 2008. In 2011, Skanska was ranked the greenest company in the United Kingdom, despite belonging to an industry with a generally high environmental impact. In 2014, Skanska won the Financial Times and ArcelorMittal &quot;Boldness in Business Award&quot; in the category &quot;corporate responsibility/environment.&quot;

The Financial Times described Skanska in 2014 as aiming to be the &quot;greenest contractor in the world,&quot; while having 57,000 employees, 100,000 suppliers and 250,000 subcontractors, who deliver more than 10,000 projects annually. An official vision stated by Skanska is &quot;the five zeros&quot;: zero loss-making projects, work site accidents, environmental incidents, ethical breaches and defects.

In the United Kingdom, Skanska has founded the &quot;Supply Chain Sustainability School,&quot; an e-learning initiative, in order to educate construction suppliers on sustainability. As suppliers are frequently shared between construction companies, the school is managed in partnership with several competitors. In July 2013, Skanska withdrew from the United States Chamber of Commerce, in protest of the chamber&#x27;s opposition to reformed LEED standards for sustainable buildings.

Skanska was the first company in the industry to implement the ISO 14000 standards globally, with all its business units having been certified according to ISO 14001 since 2000, and it was the first Scandinavian company to have an independent global whistleblowing hotline.

=== Market ===

As of March 2015, Skanska was focused on the following selected markets:
* Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark in the Nordic region
* Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and the United Kingdom in the rest of Europe
* The United States and North America

Skanska is in the process of exiting its operations in Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Chile, Colombia, and Venezuela. Skanska will cease to accept new projects in the Latin American market and will divest its operation and maintenance units there.

Skanska is active in construction, commercial property development (office buildings, shopping centers and logistics properties) and infrastructure development (roads, hospitals and schools) in all of its three market regions. The company plans, develops and builds homes in the Nordic region and in the rest of Europe.

In 2013, Skanska was ranked the 9th largest contractor in the world, and in 2014, the 7th largest contractor in the United States.

During the rolling 12-month-period ending in September 2014, Skanska was the largest construction company by total revenue in the Nordic countries. The six largest ones were:

== Major projects ==

Skanska is also involved in HS2 lots S1 and S2, working as part of a joint venture, due to complete in 2031.

=== United States ===
Major projects in the United States include the MetLife Stadium (home to the Giants and the Jets NFL franchises), completed in 2010. In 2010, Skanska was awarded a $115 million (SEK840 million) contract by the Washington State Department of Transportation for construction of a new State Route 99 roadway in downtown Seattle, Washington, part of the project to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct. Skanska has also developed several commercial and residential buildings in Seattle region, including the upcoming 2&amp;U high-rise office building in downtown Seattle.

Other major projects include the renovation of, and addition to, the headquarters of the United Nations, completed in 2014, the restoration of the World Trade Center site including the removal of debris, the reconstruction of the Port Authority Trans-Hudson and New York City Subway tunnels, and the creation of a World Trade Center Transportation Hub, completed in 2015 (including the &quot;Oculus&quot; station entrance designed by Santiago Calatrava), the Second Avenue Subway tunneling project completed in 2016 and Moynihan Train Hall completed in 2020.

Skanska was also part of a joint venture with Stacy and Witbeck on The Sixth Street Viaduct Replacement Project completed in 2022.

== Awards and recognition ==
Skanska USA CEO and president, Richard Kennedy, was named in the Construction Dive Awards Executive of the Year in 2019. Skanska was also recognized for its membership in the Predictive Analytics Strategic Council, which Construction Dive named its 2019 Innovator of the Year.

== Controversies ==

In 1996, Skanska was entrusted with the building of a &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; general hospital, Mater Dei Hospital, costing over €700,000,000 in Malta. Later, however, it was discovered that Skanska had used lower-quality cement of the kind that is generally used to build pavements. As a result, the hospital could not develop further floors or build a helipad on the roof. The company had limited liability within the contract.

A scandal broke out in 1997 when it was learned that a poisonous sealing compound &quot;Rhoca-Gil&quot; was used during construction of a railway tunnel, Hallandsås Tunnel, in southern Sweden. This substance was linked to the death of nearby livestock. Rhoca-Gil contains acrylamide, a toxic chemical that is mutagenic and possibly carcinogenic. Skanska took no special precautions for the sealant, nor did it tell its own workers or the local population of the risks. By October 1997, local cattle and fish started dying and workers were becoming ill. After tests were done showing high levels of acrylamide contamination, the site was declared a high risk zone and the sale of agricultural products from the region was banned. Skanska, along with Rhone-Poulenc and Swedish Railways all had criminal charges brought against them; some senior executives resigned as a result. Construction was halted in late 1997, but resumed in 2005 after hydrological and environmental remediation by Banverket and Skanska.

In 2005, Skanska was awarded a large natural gas pipeline contract in Argentina. In 2007, the company was implicated in reports of bribery involving illegal payments to government officials relating to the project award. Six former Skanska managers plus a former consultant were arrested for tax evasion. Skanska performed its own investigation, dismissing seven staff, and worked closely with the authorities concerning the inquiry. Later bribery allegations related to a pipeline for Petrobras in Brazil, prompting Skanska to be barred from bidding for work for two years by the Brazilian government, and to withdraw completely from operations in South America.

Skanska-owned UK business Kværner/Trafalgar House Plc was involved with the UK&#x27;s Consulting Association, exposed in 2009 for operating an illegal construction industry blacklist; Skanska was reported to be the industry&#x27;s most prolific user of the Consulting Association&#x27;s services, spending over £28,000 on top of a £3,000 annual subscription. Later, Skanska was among eight businesses who launched the Construction Workers Compensation Scheme in 2014, condemned as a &quot;PR stunt&quot; by the GMB union, and described by the Scottish Affairs Select Committee as &quot;an act of bad faith&quot;. In December 2017, union Unite announced it had issued high court proceedings against four former chairmen of the Consulting Association, included Skanska&#x27;s former director of industrial relations, Stephen Quant, alleging breach of privacy, defamation and Data Protection Act offences. Unite also said it was taking action against 12 major contractors including Skanska.

In December 2013, the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic confirmed that Skanska DS a.s. participated in a bid rigging cartel of construction companies (together with companies of Strabag group and Mota-Engil group) in 2004. Illegal conduct was associated with the tender for the execution of works for the construction of the D1 highway from Mengusovce to Jánovce in eastern Slovakia.

On September 16, 2020, Skanska failed to secure 20 barges at and around their Pensacola Bay Bridge site in Florida ahead of the impending Hurricane Sally. Numerous barges made contact with the newly constructed bridge destroying large segments of it, leaving the bridge impassable and unsafe to drive on. This bridge is a crucial economic artery for the Pensacola-Gulf Breeze area; over 55,000 vehicles use the bridge daily. The inability for many individuals to commute to their jobs, homes, and businesses have had a detrimental impact on the area. Among the rogue barges, many washed ashore in residents yards and on roadways. As of September 22, Skanska has failed to address the disaster with the public.

<doc id="206423" wikidata="Q216649" url="?curid=206423" title="Basildon">
<text>Basildon ( ) is a town in the borough of the same name, in the county of Essex, England. It had a recorded population of 115,955 at the 2021 census. In 1931, the town had a population of 1,159.

It lies east of Central London, south of the city of Chelmsford and west of the city of Southend-on-Sea. Nearby towns include Billericay to the northwest, Wickford to the northeast and South Benfleet to the southeast. It was created as a new town after World War II in 1948, to accommodate the London population overspill from the conglomeration of four small villages, namely Pitsea, Laindon, Basildon (the most central of the four) and Vange.

The local government district of Basildon, which was formed in 1974 and received borough status in 2010, encapsulates a larger area than the town itself; the two neighbouring towns of Billericay and Wickford, as well as rural villages and smaller settlements set among the surrounding countryside, fall within its borders. Basildon Town is one of the most densely populated areas in the county. The parish of Basildon was abolished to create Billericay on 1 January 1937.

Some of Basildon&#x27;s residents work in Central London, due to the town being well connected in the county to the City of London and the Docklands financial and corporate headquarters districts, with a 36–58 minute journey from the three Basildon stations on the c2c to London Fenchurch Street. Basildon also has access to the City via road, on the A127 and A13.

==History==

The first historical reference to Basildon is in records from 1086. It is mentioned in the Domesday Book as &#x27;Belesduna&#x27;. The name &#x27;Basildon&#x27; may be derived from the Anglo-Saxon personal name &#x27;Boerthal&#x27; and the Anglo-Saxon word &#x27;dun&#x27;, meaning hill. In historical documents, this name had various forms over the centuries, including Berdlesdon, Batlesdon and Belesduna.

Railway service started in the 19th century to Pitsea (1856) and Laindon (1888) but it was only later that proposals to provide service to the new town of Basildon, shelved for many years because of concerns that it would simply become a commuter suburb of London, were eventually forced through. A significant number of modern-day residents do commute to London.

By the beginning of the 1900s, Basildon had evolved with much of the land having been sold in small plots during a period of land speculation and development taking placed haphazardly with building by plot owners ranging from shelters created from recycled materials to brick-built homes and with amenities such as water, gas, electricity and hard-surfaced roads lacking.

In the 1940s, Billericay Urban District Council and Essex County Council, concerned by lack of amenities in the area and by its development, petitioned the Government to create a New Town. Basildon was one of eight &#x27;New Towns&#x27; created in the South East of England after the passing of the New Towns Act. On 4 January 1949 Lewis Silkin, Minister of Town and Country Planning, officially designated Basildon as a &#x27;New Town&#x27;. Basildon Development Corporation was formed in February 1949 to transform the designated area into a modern new town. The New Town incorporated Laindon and Pitsea and was laid out around small neighbourhoods with the first house being completed in June 1951. The masterplan was published in 1951, with the landscaping proposed by Sylvia Crowe with open space and playing fields distributed throughout the developed area to preserve the best landscape features. The first tenants moved into homes in Redgrave Road in Vange. A large, illuminated town sign &quot;Basildon Town Centre Site&quot; at was erected in 1956 by the railway and stood until early construction was completed. The Basildon Centre, which incorporates the local council offices, was officially opened by Jack Cunningham on 14 November 1989.

Since March 2010 Basildon has a miniature famous white Hollywood sign, reading &quot;Basildon&quot;: at five feet tall, the new sign is one-ninth of the height of the Hollywood original. part of a plan of landscaping and infrastructure improvements funded by £400,000 from the Prescott-spearheaded Thames Gateway. Opponents from all parties believe spending could have been directed toward social problems.

==Politics==

The former constituency of Basildon was considered a barometer of public opinion in general elections. The results of the constituency elections were the same as the overall result of general elections from 1983 to its abolition in 2010. Basildon was said to epitomise the working class conversion to Thatcherism during the 1980s, though the town did not vote Conservative in 1979; nor did the Conservative Party ever hold an absolute majority in the town – its success was due to the split between the SDP and the Labour Party. &quot;Basildon Man&quot; or &quot;Essex Man&quot; was coined to describe an aspirational working class voter.

Boundary changes, which came into force from the 2010 general election, mean that the area is politically represented by two MPs, from the constituencies of Basildon and Billericay and South Basildon and East Thurrock. The current MPs are Richard Holden (Conservative Party) and James McMurdock (Reform UK.)

In terms of local politics, Basildon District elects five councillors to Essex County Council. Following the 2017 election, the seats were split: 2 to the Conservatives, 2 to Labour and 1 Independent. Noak Bridge has a parish council.

==Communities==
Basildon was built like many new towns with each area being a planned community. These communities are now the local areas of the town:

* Pitsea - one of the original four villages that were incorporated into the new town. Pitsea itself is split into 7 distinct communities - Pitsea, Pitsea Mount, Eversley, Chalvedon, Northlands (formerly Felmores), Burnt Mills and Nevendon.
* Laindon - one of the original four villages that were incorporated into the new town.
* Vange - one of the original four villages that were incorporated into the new town.
* Fryerns - an area of Basildon which is located along Whitmore Way. The name came from a nearby farm (reputedly the first farm compulsory purchased by the Basildon Development Corporation) and was formerly the home of Fryerns Comprehensive School.
* Craylands - an area between Fryerns and Pitsea, and was named after the former Craylands County Secondary School. The area is under redevelopment by Swan Housing and has been renamed by them as Beechwood Village.
* Barstable - an area situated along Timberlog Lane. The area is named after the former Barstable Hundred and known for its local shopping parade Stacey&#x27;s Corner.

* Pipps Hill - an industrial area just north of Gloucester Park and west of Cranes.
* Cranes - an industrial area east of Pipps Hill. The name comes from the former Cranes Farm which stood on the site.

Basildon has a heavily developed industrial base. During the construction of the New Town, government grants were given to companies to set up their businesses in Basildon. Amongst the companies that took up these grants were Ford Motor Company (opened 1964), Carreras Tobacco Company (1959–1984), Yardley of London (1966–1998), Gordon&#x27;s Gin (1984–1998) and GEC-Marconi (now home to Leonardo MW).

Argos opened a regional warehouse on Pipps Hill Industrial Estate in the 1990s. In 2015, an Amazon delivery base was opened in Christopher Martin Road.

A datacentre hosting the European matching engine of the Intercontinental Exchange is located in Gardiners Lane, Basildon on the site of the former York International factory.

In 2017, Costa Coffee opened their new coffee roastery in Basildon. It is said to be Europe&#x27;s biggest coffee roastery – quadrupling Costa&#x27;s roasting capacity from 11,000 tonnes per year to 45,000 tonnes. The facility, which is dubbed &quot;Paradise Street&quot;, can handle around 24 tonnes of coffee beans per hour.

==Transport==

===Road===

The two main roads from London to Southend, the A13 and A127, pass to the south and north of the town respectively. Both are important commuter trunk roads, allowing easy access to the M25 and the rest of the motorway network. Locally, the A13 gives access to Pitsea and Vange; the A127 gives access to the town centre and Laindon.

Within the town are six main roads which link to and from the A13 and A127; all of them include the word &#x27;Mayne&#x27; in their names.

====A127, Basildon Enterprise Corridor====

As part of Basildon&#x27;s redevelopment Essex County Council had proposed that the A127 undergo significant development at a cost of £15 million, which was expected to be finished by March 2011. It was funded via the Community Infrastructure Fund (CIF). The project was completed and was divided into three sections:
* Section 1 – Eastmayne. Implementation of an additional lane northbound (600 metres approx.) and new drainage and footpath realignment.
* Section 2 – Cranes Farm Road. Included dualling of the existing carriageway of which was already there (approx. 1500m) and enhancing and upgrading junctions – with the creation of a dedicated left turn lane at the roundabout at Eastmayne to help ease traffic flows during busy hours at the junction.
* Section 3 – Introduction of a new A176 junction at Pipps Hill. This included upgrading the east and westbound off slips to increase the capacity of vehicles and ease traffic flows. The implementation of queue detection and advanced warning signs was also added to this section of the road. Part of section 3 also saw the introduction of the new &quot;Hollywood&quot; sign for Basildon at the A176 junction.

A wakeboarding complex also opened in 2012, attracting both professionals and amateurs alike

===Theatre===
The Arts Centre was the first theatre in Basildon, opening in 1968 in a temporary facility behind the then temporary council offices, on the site of the current Westgate shopping park. This was renamed &#x27;The Towngate Theatre and Arts Centre&#x27; in 1976, before being replaced by a new purpose built theatre as part of the new Basildon Centre, on the opposite side for the former Towngate Road.

In 1989, the culture and history of the town was documented by the newly re-opened Towngate Theatre, when it commissioned a community play from Arnold Wesker for the town&#x27;s 40th anniversary. The potted history that Wesker called &quot;Boerthel&#x27;s Hill&quot; was acted out by a 125 members of the community recording a fascinating history of London&#x27;s East Enders, who were the first Basildon residents.

===Cinema===
Basildon currently has one cinema, Cineworld, which is located at the Festival Leisure Park. This was previously owned by Empire Cinemas but was purchased as part of $124m deal to purchase 5 cinemas. It had opened originally as a UCI.

Previously, Basildon had an ABC Cinema, which was built in 1971 and was based in North Gunnells. This changed hands several times becoming a Cannon and a Robins cinema before closing in 1999. The building until August 2022 was home to the British Heart Foundation store. Prior to this, a cinema in Pitsea, originally called The Broadway from 1930, before changing its name in 1955 as The Century, operated until its closure in 1966 when it was converted to a Bingo hall.

In 2018, planning permission was granted for a new ten screen Empire cinema, along with new restaurants on the site of Freedom House in Basildon town centre, with demolition of the current buildings on site starting in 2019. As of January 2023, the partially completed cinema has not opened. As of July 2024, the cinema was opened under Vue&#x27;s management.

===Libraries and museums===
Basildon Central Library is now based in the Basildon Centre (since 1989), but had previously been in prefabs next to the temporary council offices on Fodderwick. There are also numerous smaller libraries across Basildon: Clay Hill Road in Vange, Pitsea Centre in Pitsea, Fryerns Library in Whitmore Way, and Laindon Library on New Century Road Laindon.

Basildon is home to the Haven Plotlands Museum and was previously home to the National Motorboat Museum, which had been based at Wat Tyler Park. Currently there is not a museum dedicated to the history of Basildon, though plans had previously been made to site one at Wat Tyler Park. As of 2018 there is still a campaign to have a museum created.

===Parks and recreations grounds===
Basildon was designed with large amounts of green spaces with Gloucester Park dominating the centre of Basildon. Kent View Recreation ground in Vange and Northlands Park in Pitsea are the other large green spaces. Other formal parks include Mopsies Park in Timberlog Lane, and Howards Park in Pitsea.

Basildon is also home to Wat Tyler Country Park which opened in 1984; Marks Hill Nature Reserve (opened 1981); Vange Hill; One Tree Hill Country Park; Langdon Hill Country Parks and the RSPB Nature Reserve at Bowers Marshes. Essex Wildlife Trust run a large reserve at Langdon.

===Heritage===
Even though Basildon is a new town, there are still traces of its historical past visible. Old roads that once connected the villages have been incorporated into the new town: Clay Hill Road, Timberlog Lane, Rectory Road, Pound Lane, Church Road and Dry Street. Dry Street is a perfect example of old Basildon, as it is an undeveloped country lane that runs through One Tree Hill and Langdon Hill Country Parks and is home to several listed properties.

Other than St Martin&#x27;s Church, most of the historical parish churches still exist. St Nicholas (13th century and Grade 1 listed) sits proudly over Laindon, from where Basildon can be seen clearly, however St Peter&#x27;s (13th century Grade II* listed) at Nevendon is hidden behind Sainsbury&#x27;s and is little known by its residents. St Michael&#x27;s at Pitsea is said to be 13th century, but was rebuilt in 1870 and now only its Bell Tower remains on Pitsea Mount. The village of Basildon&#x27;s parish church, Holy Cross (Grade II listed) can still be seen in Church Road, while Vange&#x27;s 14th-century church All Saints was remodelled in the 19th century and is set back from the London Road and is Grade II listed.

Other buildings of note are: the Barge Inn at Vange; the Broadway at Pitsea, with its mock Tudor architecture built by Harold Howard in 1929; Cromwell Manor, formerly Pitsea Hall Grade II listed, by Pitsea railway station that dates from the 15th century; and Great Chalvedon Hall, Grade II listed and now a pub in Tyefields, which is reputed to date from the 16th century. Nevendon Hall was built in 1789 and is Grade II listed. The moat at the former site of Boetlers, a Tudor house demolished in the 1960s, is located near to Holy Cross Church.

One notable building is Little Coopers Farmhouse, which was originally located in Takeley. It was designated a Grade II building in 1980. In the late 1980s, due to redevelopment, the whole structure was dismantled and re-built at the Wat Tyler Country Park.

On the west side of town, the Dunton Plotlands area was occupied by small rural dwellings in the mid twentieth century. Today, it forms Langdon Nature Reserve.

In 2008, a National Lottery funded heritage trail was started to highlight the 1960s architecture.

===Media===
Basildon&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Essex, Heart East, Greatest Hits Radio East and its own community radio station, which is aimed towards the residents of Basildon, East Thurrock and its surrounding areas called Gateway 97.8 which broadcasts from the Eastgate Shopping Centre.

Basildon is within the BBC London and ITV London region. Television signals are received from Crystal Palace TV transmitter. BBC East and ITV Anglia can also be received from the Sudbury TV transmitter as well as BBC South East and ITV Meridian from the Bluebell Hill TV transmitter. Basildon Development Corporation had installed a Cable Television service into many of its home, called Rediffusion, but this service stopped during the 1990s. The service was replaced by United Artists Cable which were based in the town; this is now Virgin Media, although the customer service operation closed in the 2000s.

Since 1969, The Evening Echo newspaper offices have been based on the Pipps Hill Industrial Estate. The town has been home to The Yellow Advertiser since 1976.

===Television===
Basildon was the setting for the BBC programme White Gold with filming taking place in Basildon Town Centre. Channel 5 programme Extreme Hair Wars was set at JET training academy in Basildon. The fictional character Nellie Bertram, played by Catherine Tate in the U.S. comedy television series &quot;The Office&quot; was said to have been born in Basildon.

===Music===
Basildon had a great influence on the 1980s music scene with bands Depeche Mode and Yazoo, and later by Alison Moyet in her solo career and Vince Clarke in his role with Erasure.

===Film===
The documentary film New Town Utopia by Christopher Ian Smith was made about Basildon. Basildon also hosts Europe&#x27;s only Underwater film studio that can be inside or out, as it has a removable roof. The studios have been used to film scenes in the Anglo-French drama &quot;The Tunnel&quot; and for the film &quot;47 Meters Down&quot;.

===Art===
Basildon was the focus of &quot;Magic Party Place&quot; by photographer CJ Clarke. &quot; a largely white working class community, the town is one of the most statistically average places in England&quot;, he said.

=== Poetry and literature ===
Caron Freeborn, (previously Severn), (1966–2019) author, poet and performer, grew up in Basildon and attended Fryerns Comprehensive. Later she attended Lucy Cavendish college at Cambridge as a mature student, then as a teacher/lecturer in creative writing including poetry. Freeborn obtained her master&#x27;s degree in Renaissance literature. She published three novels: &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot; (2001), described by Marian Keyes as &quot;a dark and compelling love story of a genre that could be called East End noir&quot;; &quot;Prohibitions&quot; (2004), a literary thriller again set in the East End; and &quot;Presenting … the Fabulous O&#x27;Learys&quot; (2017), a take on &quot;King Lear&quot;, updated to the 1980s. &quot;Georges Perec is my hero&quot; (2015) showcased Freeborn&#x27;s poetic voice(s). Much of &quot;Georges Perec is my hero&quot; celebrates the real, the brutal (including embracing the brutalist architecture of Basildon), with many poems and photographs based on the town.

==Modern architecture and design==
St. Martin&#x27;s Church in Basildon town centre is a modern structure. The church was consecrated in 1962 by the Bishop of Chelmsford. A freestanding glass bell tower was built in 1999 and opened by Queen Elizabeth II.

Although there are a number of tall buildings in central Basildon, there are also many newly constructed buildings closer to the &#x27;Basildon Enterprise Corridor&#x27; situated in North Basildon.

The largest structure in the new town&#x27;s town centre is Brooke House, a 14-story residential tower block that fronts the west side of the town centre&#x27;s East Square. Dating from 1962, it was designed by Sir Basil Spence and Anthony B. Davies, with Ove Arup and Partners as the structural engineers. It has a 1960s Brutalist design, elevated on eight massive V-shaped concrete pylons. The building was chosen to have a residential function, as opposed to commercial office space, to retain life in the town centre after the shops had closed. Shops were positioned to the rear of the building, with Brooke House acting as a covered forecourt. It was conceived as a structure to define Basildon&#x27;s urban status and to act as marker to identify the town centre&#x27;s location within a largely low-rise settlement set in a flat landscape. It was named after the then Minister of Housing and Local Government, Henry Brooke MP. The building was given Grade II listing in 1998.

East of Brooke House is East Square, a sunken open-air public plaza accessed from Brooke House by a monumental staircase and a curved ramp which was listed in 1998 as Grade II. Formerly the east side of the square was fronted by Freedom House, containing shops on two levels, and the north side by the Post Office building, a 5-story structure. Formerly on the wall of Freedom House is the oldest piece of public sculpture in the new town: installed in 1957, it is a wire and aluminium relief by the sculptor A. J. Poole titled &quot;Man Aspires&quot;. The whole ensemble was designed to create a formal setting for Brooke House, and had a similar Brutalist design, though softened by other architectural features. Freedom House was demolished, along with the Post Office building as part of the new cinema construction in 2019. The town centre extends from East Square towards the south-west. Down the middle of this zone runs a rectangular raised pool. Within the pool is a bronze sculpture and fountain, titled &quot;Mother and Child&quot;, by the sculptor Maurice Lambert and dating from 1959 which was listed as Grade II in 1998.

On the upper level of Eastgate is the Cats Cradle Pussiwillow III Clock. It was created by Rowland Emett in 1981 and was originally placed outside what is now ASDA on the Lower Mall of the shopping centre. It was officially unveiled by Michael Bentine.

The Barstable School building first opened on 1 March 1962 and was designed by the Finnish architect Cyril Leonard Sjöström Mardall (of YRM Architects, Yorke, Rosenberg and Mardall). The building was listed in 1993 and is Grade II listed. It is now home to the lower school of the Basildon Academies.

==Regeneration==
Basildon has gone through several regenerations – a few highlights are:

*Investment in the Basildon Enterprise Corridor, a large business area.
*The creation of a new wetland nature reserve in the Thames Marshes by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), the Land Restoration Trust, Basildon District Council and Veolia.
*A review of the district&#x27;s housing, with investment in housing estates such as Craylands, Five Links and Felmores which will be re-designed to allow for less trouble and having more streets with roads, rather than a street with just pavement.
*The regeneration of Pitsea town centre.

Some future plans include:

*The regeneration of Basildon and Laindon town centres.
*The creation of a health and education research centre near Basildon University Hospital.
*There is a proposal for creating Dunton Garden Suburb on land between Basildon and Brentwood. This proposal may have 6,000 homes, together with retail, commercial and leisure uses. This is a joint proposal of the two councils and a public consultation ended in March 2015. The proposal has been met with criticism from all political parties and the residents group Residents Against Inappropriate Development
*In 2018 planning permission was granted for a new 10 screen Empire Cinema along with new restaurants on the site of Freedom House in Basildon town centre.

<doc id="206425" wikidata="Q2891013" url="?curid=206425" title="Midrash halakha">
<text>Midrash halakha () was the ancient Judaic rabbinic method of Torah study that expounded upon the traditionally received 613 Mitzvot (commandments) by identifying their sources in the Hebrew Bible, and by interpreting these passages as proofs of the laws&#x27; authenticity.

The term &quot;midrash halakha&quot; is also applied to the derivation of new laws, either by means of a correct interpretation of the obvious meaning of scriptural words themselves or by the application of certain hermeneutic rules.

The word &quot;midrash&quot; is rooted in the term &quot;drash&quot;, literally &quot;seek,&quot; or &quot;enquire,&quot; but practically meaning exposition. &quot;Midrash&quot; is then &quot;that which has been expounded,&quot; or more simply, a work focused on rabbinic exposition (of the Torah or of Torah based laws and ethics). The word is applied only to compilations of &quot;Tannaic midrash&quot; or to the &quot;Tannaic&quot; exposition process.

However, the common term &quot;midrash&quot; used by itself has come to be a shorthand for the term &quot;midrash aggadah&quot; which, in contrast to &quot;midrash halakha,&quot; are non-legal &quot;tannaic&quot; expositions that are based on the Bible. &quot;Midrash halakha&quot; is not aggadic, sometimes resulting in confusion with the common shorthand meaning of &quot;midrash&quot;. Instead, the product of &quot;midrash halakha&quot; are legal works, primarily Mishnah and Beraisa.

==Terminology==
The phrase &quot;Midrash halakha&quot; was first employed by Nachman Krochmal, the Talmudic expression being &quot;Midrash Torah&quot; = &quot;investigation of the Torah&quot;. These interpretations were often regarded as corresponding to the real meaning of the scriptural texts; thus it was held that a correct elucidation of the Torah carried with it the proof of the &quot;halakha&quot; and the reason for its existence. 

==Types==
In the &quot;midrash halakha&quot; three divisions may be distinguished: 
* The &quot;midrash&quot; of the older &quot;halakha&quot;, that is, the &quot;midrash&quot; of the Soferim and the &quot;Tannaim&quot; of the first two generations;
* The &quot;midrash&quot; of the younger &quot;halakha&quot;, or the &quot;midrash&quot; of the &quot;Tannaim&quot; of the three following generations;
* The &quot;midrash&quot; of several younger &quot;Tannaim&quot; and of many &quot;Amoraim&quot; who did not interpret a biblical passage as an actual proof of the &quot;halakha&quot;, but merely as a suggestion or a support for it (&quot;zekher le-davar&quot;; &quot;asmakhta&quot;).

===The Midrash of the older &quot;halakha&quot;===
The older &quot;halakha&quot; sought only to define the compass and scope of individual laws, asking under what circumstances of practical life a given rule was to be applied and what would be its consequences. The older &quot;midrash&quot;, therefore, aims at an exact definition of the laws contained in the scriptures by an accurate interpretation of the text and a correct determination of the meaning of the various words. The form of exegesis adopted is frequently one of simple lexicography, and is remarkably brief.

A few examples will serve to illustrate the style of the older &quot;midrash halakha&quot;. It translates the word &quot;ra&#x27;ah&quot; (Exodus 21:8) as &quot;displease&quot; (Mekhilta, Mishpatim), which is contrary to the interpretation of Rabbi Eliezer. From the expression &quot;be-miksat&quot; (Exodus 12:4), which, according to it, can mean only &quot;number,&quot; the older &quot;halakha&quot; deduces the rule that when killing the Passover lamb the slaughterer must be aware of the number of persons who are about to partake of it.

The statement that the determination of the calendar of feasts depends wholly on the decision of the Nasi and his council is derived from Leviticus 23:37, the defectively written &quot;otam&quot; (them) being read as &quot;attem&quot; (you) and the interpretation, &quot;which you shall proclaim,&quot; being regarded as conforming to the original meaning of the phrase. When two different forms of the same word in a given passage have been transmitted, one written in the text (&quot;ketib&quot;), and the other being the traditional reading (&quot;qere&quot;), the &quot;halakha&quot;, not wishing to designate either as wrong, interprets the word in such a way that both forms may be regarded as correct. Thus it explains Leviticus 25:30-where according to the &quot;qere&quot; the meaning is &quot;in the walled city,&quot; but according to the &quot;ketib&quot;, &quot;in the city that is not walled&quot;-as referring to a city that once had walls, but no longer has them. In a similar way it explains Leviticus 11:29. According to Krochmal, the &quot;ketib&quot; was due to the Soferim themselves, who desired that the interpretation given by the &quot;halakha&quot; might be contained in the text; for example, in the case of &quot;otam&quot; and &quot;attem&quot; noted above, they intentionally omitted the letter &quot;vav&quot;.

===The Midrash of the younger &quot;halakha&quot;===
The younger &quot;halakha&quot; did not confine itself to the mere literal meaning of single passages, but sought to draw conclusions from the wording of the texts in question by logical deductions, by combinations with other passages, etc. Hence its &quot;midrash&quot; differs from the simple exegesis of the older &quot;halakha&quot;. It treats the Bible according to certain general principles, which in the course of time became more and more amplified and developed (see Talmud); and its interpretations depart further and further from the simple meaning of the words.

A few examples will illustrate this difference in the method of interpretation between the older and the younger &quot;halakhah&quot;. It was a generally accepted opinion that the first Passover celebrated in Egypt, that of the Exodus, differed from those that followed it, in that at the first one the prohibition of leavened bread was for a single day only, whereas at subsequent Passovers this restriction extended to seven days. The older &quot;halakha&quot; represented by R. Jose the Galilean, bases its interpretation on a different division of the sentences in Exodus 13 than the one generally received; connecting the word &quot;ha-yom&quot; (= &quot;this day&quot;, the first word of verse 13:4) with verse 13:3 and so making the passage read: &quot;There shall no leavened bread be eaten this day.&quot; The younger &quot;halakha&quot; reads &quot;ha-yom&quot; with verse 13:4, and finds its support for the traditional &quot;halakha&quot; by means of the principle of &quot;semukot&quot; (collocation); that is to say, the two sentences, &quot;There shall no leavened bread be eaten,&quot; and &quot;This day came ye out,&quot; though they are separated grammatically, are immediately contiguous in the text, and exert an influence over each other. What the older &quot;halakha&quot; regarded as the obvious meaning of the words of the text, the younger infers from the collocation of the sentences.

The wide divergence between the simple exegesis of the older &quot;halakha&quot; and the artificiality of the younger is illustrated also by the difference in the method of explaining the Law, cited above, in regard to uncleanness. Both &quot;halakhot&quot; regard it as self-evident that if a man is unclean, whether it be from contact with a corpse or from any other cause, he may not share in the Passover. The younger &quot;halakha&quot;, despite the dot over the ה, reads &quot;rechokah&quot; and makes it refer to &quot;derekh&quot; (&quot;road&quot; or &quot;way&quot;) even determining how far away one must be to be excluded from participation in the feast. However, to find a ground for the &quot;halakha&quot; that those who are unclean through contact with other objects than a corpse may have no share in the Passover, it explains the repetition of the word &quot;ish&quot; in this passage (Leviticus 9 10) as intending to include all other cases of defilement.

Despite this difference in method, the &quot;midrashim&quot; of the older and of the younger &quot;halakha&quot; alike believed that they had sought only the true meaning of the scriptures. Their interpretations and deductions appeared to them to be really contained in the text; and they wished them to be considered correct biblical expositions. Hence they both have the form of scriptural exegesis, in that each mentions the biblical passage and the &quot;halakha&quot; that explains it, or, more correctly, derives from it.

===Abstract and Midrash &quot;halakha&quot;===
It is to a law stated in this form—i.e., together with the biblical passage it derives from—that the name &quot;midrash&quot; applies, whereas one that, though ultimately based on the Bible, is cited independently as an established statute is called a &quot;halakha&quot;. Collections of halakhot of the second sort are the Mishnah and the Tosefta; compilations of the first sort are the &quot;halakhic midrashim&quot;. This name they receive to distinguish them from the &quot;haggadic midrashim&quot;, since they contain &quot;halakhot&quot; for the most part, although there are &quot;haggadic&quot; portions in them. In these collections the line between independent &quot;halakha&quot; and &quot;midrash halakha&quot; is not sharply drawn.

Many mishnayot (single paragraph units) in the Mishnah and in the Tosefta are &quot;midrashic&quot; halakhot. On the other hand, the &quot;halakhic midrashim&quot; contain independent halakhot without statements of their scriptural bases. This confusion is explained by the fact that the redactors of the two forms of halakhot borrowed passages from one another.

===The schools of R. Akiva and R&#x27; Ishmael===
Since the &quot;halakhic midrashim&quot; had for their secondary purpose the exegesis of the Bible, they were arranged according to the text of the Pentateuch. As Genesis contains very little matter of a legal character, there was probably no halakhic &quot;midras&quot;h to this book. On the other hand, to each of the other four books of the Pentateuch there was a &quot;midrash&quot; from the school of Rabbi Akiva and one from the school of Rabbi Ishmael, and these &quot;midrashim&quot; are still in great part extant. The &quot;halakhic midrash&quot; to Exodus from the school of R. Ishmael is the Mekilta, while that of the school of R. Akiva is the Mekilta of R. Shimon bar Yochai, most of which is contained in Midrash ha-Gadol.

A &quot;halakhic midrash&quot; to Leviticus from the school of R. Akiva exists under the name &quot;Sifra&quot; or &quot;Torat Kohanim.&quot; There was one to Leviticus from the school of R. Ishmael also, of which only fragments have been preserved. The &quot;halakhic midrash&quot; to Numbers from the school of R. Ishmael is the &quot;Sifre&quot;; while of that of the school of R. Akiva, the Sifre Zutta, only extracts have survived in Yalkut Shimoni and &quot;Midrash HaGadol&quot;. The middle portion of the Sifre to Deuteronomy forms a &quot;halakhic midrash&quot; on that book from the school of R. Akiva, while another from the school of R. Ishmael has been shown by Hoffmann to have existed. This assignment of the several &quot;midrashim&quot; to the school of R. Ishmael and to that of R. Akiva respectively, however, is not to be too rigidly insisted upon; for the Sifre repeats in an abbreviated form some of the teachings of the Mekilta, just as the Mekilta included in the &quot;Midrash HaGadol&quot; has incorporated many doctrines from Akiba&#x27;s &quot;midrash&quot;.

&quot;Midrashic halakhot&quot; found also scattered through the two Talmuds; for many halakhic baraitot (traditions in oral law) that occur in the Talmuds are really &quot;midrashic&quot;, recognizable by the fact that they mention the scriptural bases for the respective halakhot, often citing the text at the very beginning. In the Jerusalem Talmud the &quot;midrashic baraitot&quot; frequently begin with &quot;ketib&quot; (= &quot;It is written&quot;), followed by the scriptural passage. From the instances of &quot;midrashic baraitot&quot; in the Talmud that are not found in the extant &quot;midrashim&quot;, the loss of many of the latter class of works must be inferred.

===The midrash of several younger &quot;Tannaim&quot; and of many &quot;Amoraim&quot;===
The &quot;midrash&quot; which the &quot;Amoraim&quot; use when deducing &quot;tannaitic halakhot&quot; from the scriptures is frequently very distant from the literal meaning of the words. The same is true of many explanations by the younger &quot;tannaim&quot;. These occur chiefly as expositions of such halakhot as were not based on scripture but which it was desired to connect with or support by a word in the Bible. The Talmud often says of the interpretations of a baraita: &quot;The Biblical passage should be merely a support&quot; (asmachta). Of this class are many of the explanations in the Sifra and in the Sifre. The &quot;tanna&quot; also often says frankly that he does not cite the biblical word as proof (&quot;re&#x27;aya&quot;), but as a mere suggestion (&quot;zecher&quot;; lit. &quot;reminder&quot;) of the halakah, or as an allusion (&quot;remez&quot;) to it.

<doc id="206426" wikidata="Q310471" url="?curid=206426" title="Toni Sailer">
<text>Anton Engelbert &quot;Toni&quot; Sailer (17 November 1935 – 24 August 2009) was an Austrian alpine ski racer, considered among the best in the sport. At age 20, he won all three gold medals in alpine skiing at the 1956 Winter Olympics. He nearly duplicated the feat at the 1958 World Championships with two golds and a silver. He also won world titles both years in the combined, then a &quot;paper&quot; race, but awarded with medals by the International Ski Federation (FIS).

==Career==
Born and raised in Kitzbühel in Tyrol, Sailer was nicknamed &quot;Blitz from Kitz&quot; (Blitz = German word for &quot;bolt of lightning&quot; or &quot;flash&quot;). A phenomenon as a teenager, he won the downhill and combined at the Grand Prix at Megève in 1952 at age 16. A broken leg caused him to miss the 1953 season and kept him from performing well at the World Championships in 1954. He returned to championship form in 1955 at age 19 and the following year became the first to win all three alpine skiing events at the Olympics, taking gold in the downhill, slalom, and giant slalom by 3.5, 4.2 and 6.2 seconds, respectively. He was the fifth athlete to win three gold medals in the same Olympic games, and became the most successful athlete at the 1956 Winter Olympics. The Super-G event did not exist until the 1980s. It was added to the Olympics in 1988. Through 2014, Sailer remains the youngest male gold medalist in Olympic alpine skiing.

From 1948 through 1980, Olympic alpine ski events doubled as the FIS World Championships, therefore the Olympic champion in any event was also the world champion. The combined event was dropped after 1948 to make way for the giant slalom in 1950. No Olympic medals were awarded for the combined event from 1952 through 1984, but it was an FIS world championship from 1954 through 1980. During this era, it was conducted as a &quot;paper&quot; race, using the results of the three events. A stand-alone combined event returned to the world championships in 1982 and to the Olympics in 1988, with one run of downhill and two runs of slalom.

Two years after the 1956 Olympics, Sailer won three gold medals and one silver at the 1958 World Championships in Bad Gastein, Austria. He won five of six possible Olympic/World Championship races, missing a perfect record with a silver in the Bad Gastein slalom, seven-tenths of a second back. Sailer also repeated as champion in the combined for a seventh world title in two years. Due to controversy over his amateur status after receiving compensation for acting (and skiing) in movies, he retired from ski racing competition in 1959.

==After racing==

Sailer&#x27;s business interests included ski clothing and equipment, including the first successful fiberglass skis, made in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. In 1957–71, he appeared in a handful of movies, most of them shallow comedies at least partly set in alpine regions, with Sailer showing off his talent. In 1972–76, he was chief trainer and technical director of the Austrian Skiing Association (ÖSV). During the 1960s and 1970s, he ran a summer ski camp at Whistler in western Canada. Occasionally, as late as 2003 he was noted for appearing in a number of TV episodes or made for TV movies. He also sang professionally for a time, making 18 record albums.

Sailer, although not associated with any political party, announced in January 2004 that he would run for Mayor of Kitzbühel. A few weeks later he withdrew his candidature, saying he had only now realized that being mayor was a full-time job. In 2006 he announced his retirement as &quot;chief of race&quot; of the Hahnenkamm Race, a position which he had occupied for 20 years.

==Honors==
Sailer was named Austrian Sportspersonality of the year in 1956, 1957, and 1958, and &quot;Austrian Sportspersonality of the Century&quot; in 1999. On 16 September 1958, he was featured on the cover of Bravo magazine.

For his contribution to the Olympic Movement, the International Olympic Committee awarded him the Olympic Order in 1985.

==Personal life==
Sailer married Gaby Rummeny in 1976 in Vancouver; she died of cancer in 2000. His second marriage, to Hedwig Fischer, lasted from 2006 until his death. His son Florian (by Rummeny) also survives him.

==Death==
It was announced in January 2008 that Sailer had laryngeal cancer, for which he had been undergoing chemotherapy in the preceding months. He died of cancer in Innsbruck, aged 73, in 2009, and was buried in Kitzbühel. His funeral ceremonies took place near the Hahnenkamm finish line.

<doc id="206427" wikidata="Q1044197" url="?curid=206427" title="USS Ranger (CV-4)">
<text>USS &quot;Ranger&quot; (CV-4) was an interwar United States Navy aircraft carrier, the only ship of its class. As a Treaty ship, &quot;Ranger&quot; was the first U.S. vessel to be designed and built from the keel up as a carrier. She was relatively small, just long and under , closer in size and displacement to the first US carrier——than later ships. An island superstructure was not included in the original design, but was added after completion.

Deemed too slow for use with the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s carrier task forces against Japan, she spent most of World War II in the Atlantic Ocean, where the German fleet, the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, was a weaker opponent. &quot;Ranger&quot; saw combat in that theater and provided air support for Operation Torch. In October 1943, she fought in Operation Leader, air attacks on German shipping off Norway. She was sold for scrap in 1947.

== Design and development ==
Work began in 1925 on the design of a fourth aircraft carrier for the US Navy, as a follow-on to the small , converted from a collier, and the large and , which were in the process of being converted from incomplete battlecruisers. Carrier number four was the Navy&#x27;s first opportunity to design a ship built as an aircraft carrier. Preliminary design work occurred before extensive operation of the preceding three. Having limited experience to draw on, key characteristics of the design were derived from wargaming experience at the U.S. Naval War College. During design and construction many alterations would occur as a result of increasing experience with &quot;Langley, Lexington,&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot;.

The major limitation constraining any design was the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. After &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot;, there were remaining for construction of aircraft carriers. This resulted in modeling for three 23,000 long ton carriers, four 17,250 ton carriers, and five 13,800 ton carriers. Of the three sizes, the smaller 13,800 was selected because the five hulls would have the largest aggregate aircraft capacity. Wargames had indicated that severe attrition to airframes and hulls would occur in any war. The college&#x27;s solution was to maximize the number of aircraft and hulls allowable under the treaty.

Initially, &quot;Ranger&quot; was designed as a flush-decker, like &quot;Langley&quot;, with nothing extending above the flight deck. Keeping the flightdeck clear of obstacles complicated the arrangement of machinery. The smoke from her six boilers was vented up six small stacks, with three on each side of the aft hangar. The stacks were hinged and were rotated to a position parallel with the hangar deck during flight operations. The unusual stack arrangement is a carry-over from her flush-deck design. When an island was added midway through construction, rebuilding the uptakes into the island was rejected as too costly. The further aft the boilers were placed, the further aft the stacks could be too, dispersing smoke over less of the deck. Concerns about smoke dispersion impacted propulsion design. Size of the plant influenced both the placement of the boilers and the amount of smoke generated. A moderate 53,000 shp power plant could be placed further aft than a 100,000 shp plant without affecting trim. The smaller plant also produced fewer gasses than a 100,000 shp plant. Due to space limits, the carrier was equipped with geared turbines.

Nearly her entire upper deck was devoted to the hangar. The large height and open girders of the flight deck structure allowed for stowage of spare fuselages. The hangar deck was semi-open and had large roll-up metal curtain doors which could be closed in bad weather. The open hangar was adopted to allow the installation of two catapults on the hangar deck for the launching of observation aircraft. The catapults were dropped to save cost. &quot;Ranger&quot; also incorporated a gallery deck between the flight deck and hangar deck.

The flight deck was a light superstructure sheathed in wood. Designed as a weight-saving measure, the light wood deck was found to be easily repairable. Three elevators were provided to move aircraft between the flight deck and hangar deck. Outriggers at the edge of the flight deck provided extra stowage for aircraft on deck. The carrier operated 76 aircraft as constructed; equal to &quot;Lexington&quot; with half the displacement.

The carrier was one of the first U.S. Navy ships mounted with light automatic weapons to defend against dive-bombing attacks, and was initially armed with forty .50 cal machine guns. Complementing the machine guns were eight dual-purpose 5-inch (127 mm)/25 caliber guns controlled by two Mark 33 directors. The machine guns were arrayed along the gallery and the 5-inch guns arrayed with one at each corner of the gallery, two at the bow, and two on the fantail.

== Construction, refit, and modernization ==

Authorized by Congress on 13 February 1929, the U.S. Navy opened bids for the construction of the aircraft carrier on 3 September 1930. Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company outbid Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation and New York Shipbuilding Company for the contract. In November, Newport News Shipbuilding received the contract to build her. The contract price was 15.2 million dollars. On 10 December, the name &quot;Ranger&quot; was assigned to the planned aircraft carrier.

&quot;Ranger&quot; was laid down on 26 September 1931 by the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co., Newport News, Virginia, and launched on 25 February 1933, sponsored by Lou Henry Hoover, First Lady of the United States. Late in construction the design was modified to include an island, increasing her displacement to 14,500 tons. Commencing trials on 1 May 1934, &quot;Ranger&quot; made 30.35 kn and generated 58,700 shp. She was commissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 4 June 1934, with Captain Arthur L. Bristol in command.

To save money, &quot;Ranger&quot; was initially designed and commissioned without torpedo stowage or a torpedo bomber squadron. &quot;Wasp&quot; was designed and commissioned to match. On 17 October 1941 approval was given to install torpedo stowage during the next overhaul in conjunction with the activation of a torpedo squadron. On 10 January 1942 Torpedo Squadron 4 (VT-4) was activated on &quot;Ranger.&quot;

Across the years many alterations were made to her armament. The first change was to consolidate the 5-in gun battery by pairing the four main deck guns with the four gallery deck guns. The anti-aircraft armament received a major upgrade when six 1.1-in quadruple mounts were installed; the 1.1-in battery replaced a battery of 3-inch (76 mm)/50 caliber guns installed months before as placeholders. In March 1942, the .50 cal machine guns were exchanged for much more capable Oerlikon 20mm cannons. Similarly, the 1.1-in battery was swapped with quadruple Bofors 40mm guns in December 1942. &quot;Ranger&#x27;s&quot; ultimate armament was six 40mm quadruple mounts and forty-six 20mm mounts.

On 13 December 1943, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Ernest King had approved an extensive modernization. Since &quot;Ranger&quot;&#x27;s commissioning, the size of carrier aircraft had grown enormously. Her flight deck supports were no longer capable of supporting the weight of a complete, modern air group. Other aircraft operating improvements were contemplated. The aft elevator was to be enlarged, the amidship elevator was to be replaced with a deck-edge elevator, and two flight deck catapults were to be installed. Weight and protection issues were to be solved by blistering the hull. Armament was to be increased with six additional 40mm quadruple mounts. Admiral King favored having the conversions done, but the Bureau of Ships insisted that allocating the manpower and resources required to accomplish this would considerably delay the completion of new aircraft carriers under construction. The full project was indefinitely postponed on 5 April 1944 after the third, increasing estimate. After arriving at New York Harbor on 16 May, &quot;Ranger&quot; entered the Norfolk Navy Yard to have her flight deck strengthened, new aircraft catapults installed, and radar equipment updated. This provided her with the capability of night fighter-interceptor training.

==Service history==
===Inter-war period===
&quot;Ranger&quot; conducted her initial flight operations off the Virginia Capes on 21 June 1934 and departed Norfolk on 17 August for a shakedown training cruise that took her to Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, and Montevideo. She returned to Norfolk on 4 October for operations off the Virginia Capes and two stints in dry dock for post trial repairs until 1 April 1935, when she sailed for the Pacific. Transiting the Panama Canal on 7 April, she arrived in San Diego on 15 April. For nearly four years, she participated in fleet problems reaching to Hawaii, the first-ever carrier cold weather test trials in Alaska, and in western seaboard operations that took her as far south as Callao, Peru, and as far north as Seattle, Washington. On 4 January 1939, she departed San Diego for winter fleet operations in the Caribbean based at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. She then steamed north to Norfolk, arriving on 20 April.

&quot;Ranger&quot; cruised along the eastern seaboard out of Norfolk and into the Caribbean Sea. In the fall of 1939, she commenced Neutrality Patrol operations, operating out of Bermuda along the trade routes of the middle Atlantic and up the eastern seaboard up to NS Argentia, Newfoundland.

In December 1940, &quot;Ranger&quot;&#x27;s VF-4 became one of the first units to receive the newer Grumman F4F-3 Wildcats.

===World War II===
====1942====
In December 1941, she was returning to Norfolk from an ocean patrol extending to Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Arriving in Norfolk on 8 December, she sailed on 21 December for patrol in the South Atlantic. She then entered the Norfolk Navy Yard for repairs on 21 March 1942. &quot;Ranger&quot; was one of 14 ships to receive the early RCA CXAM-1 radar.

&quot;Ranger&quot; served as flagship of Rear Admiral Arthur B. Cook, Commander, Carriers, Atlantic Fleet until 6 April 1942, when he was relieved by Rear Admiral Ernest D. McWhorter, who also broke his flag in &quot;Ranger&quot;.

On 15 April 1942, Prime Minister Winston Churchill cabled President Franklin Delano Roosevelt requesting &quot;North Carolina&quot; and &quot;Ranger&quot; reinforce the British Eastern Fleet in the wake of the Indian Ocean Raid. The day before in response to advance notice of the reinforcement request routed through General George Marshall, who was then visiting London, Admiral Ernest King had already definitely stated that &quot;Ranger&quot; and any other major fleet unit could not be made available for the Indian Ocean. He stated the only manner at all in which the Navy could assist was by using &quot;Ranger&quot; to ferry the pursuit planes necessary to bring the 10th Air Force up to full operational strength. King&#x27;s draft response to Churchill&#x27;s insistence displayed a lack of tact. Roosevelt supported King, but toned down King&#x27;s draft by playing up &quot;Ranger&#x27;s&quot; faults to steer the British towards accepting the ferry mission.

Steaming to Naval Air Station Quonset Point, Rhode Island, &quot;Ranger&quot; loaded 68 Curtiss P-40Es and put to sea on 22 April, launching the Army planes on 10 May to land at Accra, on the Gold Coast of Africa (Ghana). The P-40s were a general reinforcement for the American Volunteer Group Flying Tigers (soon to be redesignated as the Army Air Forces&#x27; 23rd Fighter Group) in China, to replenish their losses as well as forming a second unit, the 51st Fighter Group. Although no difficulties were encountered in flying off &quot;Ranger&quot;″s deck, errors in crossing Africa led to the loss of 10 or so en route. Upon return to Quonset Point on 28 May, she made a patrol to Argentia, Newfoundland.

After Rommel&#x27;s victories in May and June, most notably the fall of Tobruk during the Battle of Gazala, the United States agreed to commit to the North African theater a total of nine combat groups, of which seven groups were to be in operation by the end of 1942. &quot;Ranger&quot;″s contribution to the establishment of the Ninth Air Force was to ferry another 72 Army P-40s. This time she ferried a complete combat unit, 57th Fighter Group, which she launched off the coast of Africa for Accra on 19 July. Lessons learned from the previous ferry mission resulted in negligible losses, for which the 57th received commendations. The Group was operational with the Desert Air Force in time to participate in the Second Battle of El Alamein.

After calling at Trinidad, she returned to Norfolk for local battle practice until 1 October, then based her training at Bermuda, in the company of four new s, ships converted from oil tankers to increase U.S. air power in the Atlantic Ocean.
As the largest carrier in the Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Ranger&quot; led the task force that comprised herself and the four escort carriers. These provided air superiority during the amphibious invasion of Vichy-ruled French Morocco. On 8 November 1942, Allied landings in French North Africa (Operation Torch) began. Vichy French government forces attacked the Allied forces in defense of the neutrality of French Morocco, in what became known as the Naval Battle of Casablanca.

It was still dark at 06:15 that day, when &quot;Ranger&quot;—stationed northwest of Casablanca—began launching her aircraft to support the landings made at three points on the Atlantic coast of North Africa (Operation Torch). Nine of her Wildcat fighters attacked the Rabat and Rabat-Sale aerodromes, headquarters of the French air forces in Morocco. Without loss to themselves, they destroyed seven planes at one field, and 14 bombers at the other. Another flight destroyed seven planes on the Port Lyautey field. Some of &quot;Ranger&quot;″s planes strafed four French destroyers in Casablanca Harbor, while others strafed and bombed nearby shore batteries.
The Vichy French battleship opened fire with the four guns of her one operational turret on U.S. warships covering the landings. She was hit and moderately damaged by &quot;Ranger&quot;″s dive bombers, then silenced by the fifth hit from the guns of the American battleship , which jammed the rotating mechanism of the one working turret.

&quot;Jean Bart&quot;″s 15 in turret was quickly repaired. On 10 November, &quot;Jean Bart&quot; opened fire again, and almost hit the heavy cruiser , the Task Force 34 flagship. In retaliation, bombers from &quot;Ranger&quot; inflicted severe damage on &quot;Jean Bart&quot; with two heavy bombs hitting the bow and the stern, causing the French battleship to sink into the harbor mud with decks awash. In addition to damaging and sinking &quot;Jean Bart&quot;, &quot;Ranger&quot;″s attack aircraft scored two direct bomb hits on the French destroyer leader , completely wrecking her forward half and causing 300 casualties. They also attacked the French cruiser as she sortied from Casablanca Harbor and dropped depth charges within killing range of two submarines. &quot;Ranger&quot;″s planes also knocked out coastal defense and anti-aircraft batteries, destroyed more than 70 enemy aircraft on the ground, and shot down 15 aircraft in aerial combat. It was estimated that 21 enemy light tanks were immobilized and some 86 military vehicles destroyed – most of them troop-carrying trucks. &quot;Ranger&quot; had launched 496 combat sorties in the three-day operation, with 16 planes lost or damaged beyond repair.

Casablanca capitulated to the American forces on 11 November. &quot;Ranger&quot; departed from the Moroccan coast on 12 November, returning to Hampton Roads on 24 November and Norfolk on 14 December 1942.

On 2 December 1942, &quot;Ranger&quot; was again requested for in a cable from Churchill to Roosevelt, this time in connection to American misfortunes. The loss of &quot;Hornet&quot; in the Battle of Santa Cruz Islands kicked off a confused series of messages seeking British carrier reinforcement in the Pacific. To meet the request, Churchill offered both &quot;Illustrious&quot; and &quot;Victorious&quot; in exchange for &quot;Ranger&quot; replacing &quot;Victorious&quot; in the Home Fleet. King accepted one carrier but retained &quot;Ranger&quot; to use in the Atlantic or the Pacific at his discretion.

====1943====
Following training in Chesapeake Bay, &quot;Ranger&quot; underwent an overhaul at the Norfolk Navy Yard from 16 December 1942 to 7 February 1943. By December 33 Fighter Group had taken heavy losses in Tunisia and needed reinforcement. Responding to Eisenhower&#x27;s request, &quot;Ranger&quot; departed Norfolk on 8 January with the 325th Fighter Group aboard for delivery to Casablanca. She repeated the mission with another load, 75 P-40L fighters of the Army Air Forces&#x27; 58th Fighter Group to Africa, arriving at Casablanca on 23 February.

On 25 April 1943, German radio announced &quot;Achtung! Achtung! We are proud to announce that a German submarine has sunk the United States aircraft carrier &quot;Ranger&quot; in the North Atlantic!&quot; Following this broadcast, German news releases reported that Commander Otto von Bülow of the U-boat , personally decorated by Adolf Hitler with Oak Leaves to the Knight&#x27;s Cross, had &quot;in addition to torpedoing four steamers, caught and sank the American aircraft carrier &quot;Ranger&quot;.&quot;

The US Navy, concerned about the impact of the German announcement on families of &quot;Ranger&quot; crewmen, issued a denial of the German claim. In the radio broadcast dated 15 February 1944, Captain Gordon Rowe, Commanding Officer of USS &quot;Ranger&quot;, stated:

The story that we were sunk was a coward&#x27;s trick—spreading anxiety and fear among the innocent... The next day we issued a denial and ... on October 4 we spread panic and chaos in the Norwegian shipping lanes. Only one thing we regret. We kept looking for the &quot;Tirpitz&quot; but either she wouldn&#x27;t or couldn&#x27;t come out... Meanwhile, the &quot;Ranger&quot;, still very much afloat, is doing her job.

She patrolled and trained pilots along the New England coast steaming as far north as Halifax, Nova Scotia. Departing from Halifax on 11 August, she joined the British Home Fleet at Scapa Flow, Scotland, on 19 August, with which she patrolled the approaches to the British Isles.

&quot;Ranger&quot; departed from Scapa Flow with the Home Fleet on 2 October to attack German shipping in Norwegian waters (Operation Leader). The objective of the force was the northern Norwegian port of Bodø. The task force reached launch position off Vestfjorden before dawn on 4 October completely undetected. At 06:18, &quot;Ranger&quot; launched 20 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers and an escort of eight Wildcats. One division of dive bombers attacked the freighter &quot;La Plata&quot;, while the rest continued north to attack a German ship convoy. The bombers severely damaged a tanker and a smaller troop transport. They also sank two of four small German merchant ships in the Bodø roadstead.

A second attack group from &quot;Ranger&quot;—consisting of 10 Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers and six Wildcats—destroyed a German freighter and a small coastal ship, and bombed a troop-laden transport. Three of the aircraft were lost to anti-aircraft fire. On the afternoon of 4 October, &quot;Ranger&quot; was located by three German aircraft; her combat air patrol shot down two of the enemy planes and chased away the third.

&quot;Ranger&quot; returned to Scapa Flow on 6 October. She patrolled with the British 2nd Battle Squadron in waters extending northwestward to Iceland, and then she departed from Hvalfjord on 26 November, arriving at Boston on 3 December.

====1944–1945====
On 3 January 1944, &quot;Ranger&quot; became a training carrier out of Quonset Point, Rhode Island. This duty was interrupted on 20 April when she steamed to Staten Island, New York, to take on 76 Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighters—together with Army, Navy, and French Navy personnel—for transportation to Casablanca. Steaming out on 24 April for her fifth and final transatlantic ferry mission, she arrived at Casablanca on 4 May. The new aircraft were exchanged with damaged U.S. Army aircraft marked for repair in the U.S., while military passengers were embarked for the return to New York City. After New York City, she moved to Norfolk for refit on 19 May 1944.
On 11 July, she departed from Norfolk and headed for Panama. She transited the Panama Canal five days later, embarked several hundred U.S. Army passengers at Balboa, Panama, then sailed to San Diego, arriving there on 25 July. After embarking the men and aircraft of Night Fighting Squadron 102 and nearly 1,000 U.S. Marines, &quot;Ranger&quot; steamed for Hawaiian waters on 28 July, reaching Pearl Harbor on 3 August. During the next three months, &quot;Ranger&quot; conducted night carrier flight training operations out of Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Ranger&quot; departed from Pearl Harbor on 13 October to train new naval pilots for combat duty. Operating out of San Diego under the Commander, Fleet Air, Alameda, California, &quot;Ranger&quot; continued training air groups and squadrons along the California coast throughout the remainder of the war. &quot;Ranger&quot; was the only pre-war U.S. carrier never to have engaged Japanese forces in battle.

===Post war===
Departing San Diego on 30 September 1945, she embarked civilian and military passengers at Balboa and then steamed for New Orleans, Louisiana, arriving on 18 October. Following Navy Day celebrations there, she sailed on 30 October for brief operations at Pensacola, Florida, as a training carrier, later relieved in that role by . After calling at Norfolk, she entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 19 November for overhaul. She remained on the eastern seaboard until decommissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 18 October 1946. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 29 October, she was sold for scrap to Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Chester, Pennsylvania, on 31 January 1947.

<text>John William Burgon (21 August 1813 – 4 August 1888) was an English Anglican divine who became the Dean of Chichester Cathedral in 1876. He was known during his lifetime for his poetry and his defense of the historicity and Mosaic authorship of Genesis. Long after his death he was remembered chiefly for his defense of the Byzantine text-type and continued ecclesiastical use of the traditional Received Text.

==Biography==

Burgon was born at Smyrna (now İzmir), on 21 August 1813, the son of Thomas Burgon an English merchant trading in Turkey who was also a skilled numismatist and afterwards became an assistant in the antiquities department of the British Museum. His mother is often said to have been Greek but was in fact the daughter of the Austrian consul at Smyrna and his English wife. During his first year the family moved to London, where he was sent to school. After a few years of business life, working in his father&#x27;s counting-house, Burgon went to Worcester College, Oxford, in 1841, and took his degree in 1845.

Burgon was elected to an Oriel fellowship in 1846. He was much influenced by his brother-in-law, the scholar and theologian Henry John Rose (1800–1873), a conservative Anglican churchman with whom he used to spend his long vacations. Burgon made Oxford his headquarters, while holding a living at some distance. In 1863 he was made vicar of the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, having attracted attention by his vehement sermons against &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot;, a series of messages on biblical inspiration in which he defended against the findings of textual criticism and higher criticism the historicity and Mosaic authorship of Genesis, and biblical infallibility in general: &quot;Either, with the best and wisest of all ages, you must believe the whole of Holy Scripture; or, with the narrow-minded infidel, you must disbelieve the whole. There is no middle course open to you.&quot;

In 1867 Burgon was appointed Gresham Professor of Divinity. In 1871 he published a defence of the genuineness of the twelve last verses of the Gospel of Mark. He then began an attack on the proposal for a new lectionary for the Church of England, based largely upon his objections to the principles for determining the authority of manuscript readings in the Greek New Testament adopted by Brooke Foss Westcott and Fenton John Anthony Hort. Westcott and Hort led the team producing the Revised Version of the Bible. Burgon assailed Westcott &amp; Hort in a memorable 1881 article in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, and collected his Quarterly Review articles and pamphlets into books, such as &quot;The Revision Revised&quot;, in which he denounced Westcott and Hort for elevating &quot;one particular manuscript,—namely the C (Vatican Codex (B)), which, for some unexplained reason, it is just now the fashion to regard with superstitious deference&quot;. He found their primary manuscript to be &quot;the reverse of trustworthy.&quot;

Protests against the inclusion of Unitarian Dr Vance Smith among the revisers, against the nomination of Dean Stanley to be select preacher in the University of Oxford, and against the address in favour of toleration in the matter of ritual, followed in succession. In 1876 Burgon was made the Dean of Chichester.

At Oxford, Rev. Charles Henry Waller came under Burgon&#x27;s influence.

Burgon&#x27;s two-volume biography was written by Meyrick Goulburn and published in 1892. He has been described as a high churchman of the type prevalent before the rise of the Tractarian school. His collection of transcripts from the Greek Fathers, illustrating the text of the New Testament, was bequeathed to the British Museum. The British Library holds a collation of his Greek gospel manuscripts (MSS) and New Testament index.

Burgon died unmarried at the deanery, Chichester, on 4 August 1888. He was buried in the family grave at Holywell Cemetery in Oxford on 11 August. He is commemorated by a plaque set in the floor of Chichester Cathedral&#x27;s south transept and by a window in the lady chapel.

==Literary works==
In 1845, Burgon won the Newdigate Prize, for poems by students at Oxford University, for his poem &quot;Petra&quot;, about the city of the same name, now in Jordan, which he had never seen. An excerpt describing the buildings has often been reprinted:

The poem is chiefly remembered for the famous final line above, which quotes the phrase &quot;half as old as time&quot; from Samuel Rogers. This fourteen-line excerpt is often referred to as a &quot;sonnet,&quot; but the poem is 370 lines long, in rhymed couplets. Burgon published it, apparently in a small pamphlet, in around 1845. A &quot;Second Edition&quot;, &quot;To Which a Few Short Poems Are Now Added,&quot; was published in 1846, and the text above follows that version. It contained some revisions: &quot;sanctifies&quot; had been &quot;consecrates&quot;; &quot;call&#x27;d&quot; had been &quot;deemed&quot;; &quot;But rosy-red,—as if the blush of dawn&quot; had been &quot;But rose-red as if the blush of dawn&quot;, and so on. There was also an 1885 book containing the poem.

Hugh Kenner commented on the precision of Burgon&#x27;s language:

:Though romantic, Burgon was being workmanlike. To his generation the age of Time was quite definite; for since Adam was created in the year 4004 B.C. on 23 October, Time in the year Burgon wrote, 1845, was exactly 5849 years old, going back through half of which we locate the founding of Petra at 1080 B.C.

He did not publish any other poetry. His biographical essays on Henry Longueville Mansel and others were also collected, and published under the title of &quot;Twelve Good Men&quot; (1888).

==Burgon in modern times==

The name of Burgon is now known in connection with the Burgon Society, which was founded in 2000 to promote the use and study of academical dress, so named because Burgon is the only person to have a hood shape named after him.

Another society which takes his name is the Dean Burgon Society. Burgon was outspoken about the Revised Version and maintained the position that the Bible is the inspired Word of God, but some of his views have differed from the more recent King James Only Movement.

The phrase &#x27;match me such marvel&#x27; taken from Burgon&#x27;s poem &quot;Petra&quot; serves as the fictional title of a novel by the character St John Clarke in Anthony Powell&#x27;s twelve-volume work A Dance to the Music of Time.

<text>Hyrcania (; &quot;Hyrkanía&quot;, Old Persian: 𐎺𐎼𐎣𐎠𐎴 &quot;Varkâna&quot;, Middle Persian: 𐭢𐭥𐭫𐭢𐭠𐭭 &quot;Gurgān&quot;, Akkadian: &quot;Urqananu&quot;) is a historical region composed of the land south-east of the Caspian Sea in modern-day Iran and Turkmenistan, bound in the south by the Alborz mountain range and the Kopet Dag in the east.

The region served as a satrapy (province) of the Median Empire, a sub-province of the Achaemenid Empire, and a province within its successors, the Seleucid, Arsacid and Sasanian empires. Hyrcania bordered Parthia to the east (later known as Abarshahr), Dihistan to the north, Media to the south and Mardia to the west.

==Etymology==
&quot;Hyrcania&quot; () is the Greek name for the region, a borrowing from the Old Persian &quot;Verkâna&quot; as recorded in Darius the Great&#x27;s Behistun Inscription (522 BC), as well as in other Old Persian cuneiform inscriptions. &quot;Verkā&quot; means &quot;wolf&quot; in Old Iranian, cf. Avestan &quot;vəhrkō&quot;, Gilaki and Mazandarani &quot;verk/verg&quot;, Modern Persian &quot;gorg&quot;, and Sanskrit &quot;vŗka&quot; (). Consequently, &quot;Hyrcania&quot; means &quot;Wolf-land&quot;. The name was extended to the Caspian Sea and underlies the name of the city Zadracarta, the then-largest city and the capital of ancient Hyrcania.

Another archaic name, Dahistān (not to be confused with &quot;dehestan&quot; – a modern Iranian word for &quot;district&quot; or &quot;county&quot;) is sometimes used interchangeably with Hyrcania. Dahistān refers, strictly speaking to the &quot;place of the Dahae&quot;: an extinct people who lived immediately north of Hyrcania, as early as the 5th century BC.

==History==
===Pre-Hellenistic Period===
Hyrcania formed part of the Median Empire by 600 BC, and according to Nicolaus Damascenus, was administered as a satrapy by the time of the last Median king, Astyages, who appointed a certain Artasyras as satrap (governor). Upon the fall of the Median Empire, the region willingly submitted to the Achaemenid Empire and was occupied by Cyrus the Great in 549-548 BC, and for a time Artasyras continued as satrap under Cyrus, prior to his replacement by Astyages himself. According to Ctesias, Astyages&#x27; grandson Megabernes also served as satrap of Hyrcania. Hyrcanians gave their name to the Hyrcanian plain in the middle Hermus valley in Lydia where they were settled, most likely during the reign of Cyrus the Great, as part of a policy to establish military colonies in Asia Minor. Under the Achaemenid Empire, Hyrcania served as a sub-province of the satrapy of Parthia, which was also known as the satrapy of Parthia and Hyrcania. At times, Cadusia may have been administered as part of Hyrcania. Fortifications to protect Hyrcania against nomadic incursions were constructed during the Achaemenid period.

Following Darius the Great&#x27;s victory over the Magian usurper, Gaumata, in September 522 BC, revolts spread throughout the empire. In December 522 BC, a revolt in support of the Median leader Phraortes erupted in Hyrcania, and in March 521 BC, the Hyrcanian rebels unsuccessfully attacked Hystaspes, satrap of Parthia. In May, Phraortes was defeated and Hyrcania returned to Achaemenid rule. Darius later settled Hyrcanians in the settlement of Dareionkome () in the Hyrcanian Plain in Lydia. Other Hyrcanian settlements in the Hermus valley include Ormoita and Tyanolla. According to Herodotus, Hyrcanian soldiers participated in the Second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC under the command of Megapanus. After the war, a garrison composed of Hyrcanian soldiers was posted in the valleys of the rivers Hermus and Caicus. Under Xerxes I, Hyrcania was likely detached from the satrapy of Parthia and administered separately. Some sources imply Hyrcania was later administered as a sub-province of Media. According to Ctesias, Artaxerxes I appointed his illegitimate son Ochus as satrap of Hyrcania in c. 425 BC, who later assumed the throne as Darius II and appointed Idernes as satrap. Idernes&#x27; son Terituchmes succeeded him as satrap of Hyrcania following his death and was married to Amestris, daughter of Darius II, but Terituchmes was murdered by Udiastes, a henchman of Terituchmes, for conspiring to murder Amestris and revolt against Darius so he could wed his half-sister Roxana.

By the time of Alexander the Great&#x27;s invasion of the Achaemenid Empire in 334 BC, Hyrcania was reattached to the satrapy of Parthia and administered as a sub-province. Hyrcanian soldiers are mentioned in the Battle of Gaugamela against Alexander in 331 BC. After the death of Darius III in 330 BC, many Persian noblemen fled to Hyrcania. Alexander reached Hyrcania in 330 BC, where he accepted the surrender of Phrataphernes, satrap of Hyrcania and Parthia, and chiliarch Nabarzanes. Alexander seized Zadracarta, the capital of Hyrcania, hereafter known as Syrinx, later that year and received the surrender of other satraps and nobles. Whilst in Hyrcania, Alexander appointed his general Amminapes as satrap of Hyrcania and Parthia, but was succeeded as satrap of Hyrcania by Autophradates, satrap of Mardia and Tapuria, not long after. In 328 BC, Autophradates rebelled against Alexander and Phrataphernes, who had been reinstated as satrap of Parthia, was sent to quell the revolt. Autophradates was defeated and executed by Alexander at Pasargadae in 324 BC and Phrataphernes was granted the satrapies of Hyrcania, Tapuria, and Mardia.

===Hellenistic Period===
Following the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, his empire was divided amongst the Diadochi in the Partition of Babylon, which confirmed Phrataphernes&#x27; control of Hyrcania and Parthia. The Partition of Triparadisus in 321 BC granted Parthia and Hyrcania to Philip, however, Philip was killed by Peithon, satrap of Media, in 318 BC and Peithon appointed his brother Eudemus as satrap. Eudemus was driven from Parthia and Hyrcania in 317 BC by Peithon, satrap of the Indus, who was subsequently defeated in 315 BC by Antigonus, allowing Antigonus to take control of the Asian territories of the empire. Antigonus appointed Nicanor satrap of Hyrcania and Parthia, also known as the upper satrapies, in 315 BC and continued in this office until his death during the Babylonian War in battle against Seleucus in 310 BC which allowed Seleucus to conquer the eastern territories of the empire and form the Seleucid Empire.

Seleucus&#x27; son, Antiochus I, appointed Andragoras as satrap of Parthia and Hyrcania at an unknown date prior to 266 BC, but rebelled against his successor Antiochus II in c. 245 BC. Andragoras may have founded the city of Dehestān during his tenure as satrap. Andragoras was killed in 238 BC during the Parni conquest of Parthia, led by Arsaces, who went on to conquer Hyrcania in 235 BC, thereafter forming part of the Arsacid Empire. Seleucus II attempted to reassert Seleucid control of Hyrcania and Parthia in 231 BC, but was unsuccessful as he was forced to return to Asia Minor to quell unrest.

Following the Battle of Mount Labus in 209 BC, Antiochus III invaded Hyrcania and seized the cities of Tambrax and Syrinx, forcing Arsaces II, who was permitted to continue his rule over Hyrcania and Parthia, to become a vassal of the Seleucid Empire. During the siege of Syrinx, when the wall was breached, the garrison slaughtered the Greek inhabitants and attempted to flee. Arsaces II may have reasserted his independence in 189 BC, following Antiochus&#x27; defeat at the hands of the Romans at the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC. During the reign of Antiochus IV, in the late 2nd century BC, Hyrcania still formed part of the Seleucid Empire. After Mithridates&#x27; conquest of Media in 148 BC, Hyrcanians launched an unsuccessful revolt, which was crushed by Mithridates shortly afterwards. Hyrcania served as a royal retreat and Mithridates retired there in 141 BC. In 139 BC, Demetrius II launched an invasion of the Arsacid Empire only to be defeated and captured, following which he was provided a princely residence in Hyrcania and married to Rhodogune, daughter of Mithridates. In 129 BC, the Saka tribes invaded and pillaged Hyrcania, alongside other eastern provinces, and defeated and killed two successive Arsacid kings. Soon after his ascension to the throne in 124 BC, Mithridates II, recovered Hyrcania and re-established Arsacid control.

===Post-Hellenistic period===
Artabanus, king of Hyrcania, belonging to a collateral branch of the Arsacid dynasty, led a revolt against the Roman-backed Vonones I in 10 AD and successfully usurped the throne, becoming Artabanus III. Roman interference in the Arsacid Empire resulted in the ascension of Tiridates III in 36 AD, exiling Artabanus III to Hyrcania for a short time. During his exile in Hyrcania, Artabanus III adopted Gotarzes, son of Ardawan, satrap of Hyrcania. Artabanus III retrieved the throne and was succeeded by his son Vardanes I in 38 AD, however, Gotarzes unsuccessfully attempted to usurp the throne and was forced into exile amongst the Dahae. Gotarzes invaded Hyrcania in 46 AD with the support of the Hyrcanians and Dahae to press his claim to the throne, however, upon Gotarzes&#x27; discovery of a plot amongst the nobles to remove both Gotarzes and Vardanes I and place another upon the throne, the two brothers made peace. Gotarzes agreed to not press his claim to the throne and was appointed satrap of Hyrcania, only to revolt with the support of a number of nobles and attempt to press his claim once more. Gotarzes was defeated in Hyrcania and forced into exile amongst the Dahae until the death of Vardanes I in 47 AD, thus becoming Gotarzes II.

Under the Arsacid Empire, the Great Wall of Gorgan, a series of forts and outposts with the plains of Hyrcania, was constructed to aid in the defence of Hyrcania against raids undertaken by the neighbouring Dahae tribes. At the beginning of the Roman–Parthian War of 58–63, a rebellion erupted in Hyrcania and rebels sent envoys to Emperor Nero requesting aid. The rebellion raged until 60 AD when Vologases I hastily concluded a peace treaty with the rebels to allow him to deal with the threat posed by the Romans. However, the peace treaty did not last and the Hyrcanians launched another revolt that continued until at least 75 AD. In 75 AD, the Hyrcanian rebels allied with nomadic Alan tribes and granted them safe passage through Hyrcania into Media, allowing the Alans to pillage Media and Armenia. In the time of the reign of the Emperor Antoninus Pius (138–161), Hyrcania had made itself independent and was not considered part of the Arsacid Empire. Hyrcania is mentioned as Li-chien (or Li-kan, 黎幹) in the 2nd century AD Book of Han.

Hyrcania was annexed to the Sasanian Empire in 225 AD by Ardashir I, after which the provincial centre was moved to Gurgān, which lent its name to the province during this period. The House of Aspahbadh, one of the Seven Great Houses, held lands principally within the region. Whilst staying in Hyrcania in 420 AD, Yazdegerd I was assassinated by the nobility who alleged that he had been killed by a white horse that emerged from and disappeared into a stream. The myth propagated by the nobility led people to believe the white horse was an angel sent by Ahura Mazda to end Yazdegerd&#x27;s tyranny. Gurgān is known to have held a mint as early as the reign of Yazdegerd II. An unsuccessful revolt led by Vahan Amatuni, assistant governor of Armenia, led to his, and other members of the Amatuni noble family, exile in Hyrcania in 451 AD. Priests and other nobles who had led the revolt against Yazdegerd II were also deported to Hyrcania where they stayed until they were moved to the city of New-Shapur in Abarshahr in 453 AD.

During the reign of Peroz I, the Hepthalites invaded Hyrcania and quartered at Gurgan in 465/469 AD. Peroz and his son Kavadh rallied against the Hepthalites and were defeated and captured in battle near Gurgan. At the time of the usurper Bahrām Chōbin&#x27;s movement eastward into Abarshahr in 591 AD, Hyrcania was governed by the House of Karen, one of the Seven Great Houses. Following the defeat of the usurper Bahrām Chōbin in 591 AD, Khosrow II appointed Vistahm marzban (governor) of Hyrcania as a reward for his support during the rebellion, however, Khosrow&#x27;s mistrust for Vistahm led him to attempt to execute him by luring him to the royal court. Vistahm was informed of Khosrow&#x27;s intentions and rose in revolt, conquering much of the eastern provinces of the Sasanian Empire prior to his death and defeat in battle against Smbat Bagratuni in 596 AD. Smbat was rewarded and appointed marzban of Hyrcania, which he served as until 602 AD, during which time the region is known to have prospered.

==Religion==
Hyrcania, and the rest of Iran in Antiquity, was dominated by Zoroastrianism which was practised by the majority of the population. Christianity and Judaism were also practised in the region, and, Barshabba, the apocryphal 4th century AD bishop of Merv, is attributed to the foundation of Christian monasteries in Hyrcania. A diocese of Gurgan of the Church of the East is known to have existed from 424 AD. According to Paulus Orosius, following the suppression of a revolt in Phoenicia and the conquest of Egypt in 343 BC, Artaxerxes III deported Phoenician and Egyptian Jews to Hyrcania as punishment for opposing him. Some Hyrcanian Jews returned to Palestine; however, they maintained a presence within the region as late as the 4th century AD.

== Literary references ==
In Latin literature, Hyrcania is often mentioned in relationship to tigers, which were apparently particularly abundant there during the Classical Age (though extinct in the area since the early 1970s). Virgil, in the Aeneid, had the abandoned Dido accuse Aeneas:
Nec tibi diva parens generis nec Dardanus auctor,
 perfide, sed duris genuit te cautibus horrens
 Caucasus Hyrcanaeque admorunt ubera tigres. (IV.365-7)
&quot;You had neither a goddess for a parent, nor was Dardanus the author of your race, faithless one, but the horrible Caucasus produced you from hard crags, and Hyrcanian tigers nursed you.&quot;

Following its geographical listing by Isidore of Seville in the early 7th century &quot;Etymologiae&quot; (a standard Mediaeval textbook), the name of Hyrcania became known and taught as far off as Ireland, where it was included in poems such as &quot;Cú-cen-máthair&quot; by Luccreth moccu Chiara (665 AD), the &quot;Auraicept na n-Éces&quot;, and &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; (11th century).

&quot;Felixmarte de Hircania&quot; was a Spanish chivalric romance written in 1556 by Melchor Ortega and referenced by Miguel de Cervantes in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.

Hyrcania is mentioned in the short story &quot;Rinconete y Cortadillo&quot; by Miguel de Cervantes, and constitutes one of his exemplary stories which were published in 1613. Cervantes uses this reference to portray the illiteracy of Juliana la Cariharta, a member of Monipodio&#x27;s guild. She is intending to make reference to Ocaña, a provincial town in Toledo, Spain; but she has misheard it and does not realise the difference.

Shakespeare, relying on his Latin sources, makes repeated references in his plays to the &quot;Hyrcan tiger&quot; (&quot;Macbeth,&quot; III.iv.1281) or &quot;th&#x27; Hyrcanian beast&quot; (&quot;Hamlet,&quot; II.ii.447) as an emblem of bloodthirsty cruelty. In &quot;Henry VI, Part 3,&quot; the Duke of York compares Queen Margaret unfavorably to &quot;Tygers of Hyrcania&quot; (I.iv.622) for her inhumanity. Even in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Merchant of Venice&quot;, the Prince of Morocco also made references to Hyrcania. He said (an excerpt), &quot;The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds/Of wild Arabia are as thoroughfares now.&quot;

Sir Walter Scott in an epigraph to the thirty-fifth chapter of Ivanhoe refers to &quot;the tiger of the Hyrcanian deserts&quot; as a &quot;lesser [...] risk than [...] the slumbering fire of wild fanaticism&quot; (the epigraph is cited as being written by an anonymous author).

The comic book heroine Red Sonja is described as coming from Hyrkania, an imaginary locale bordering an inland sea based loosely on Hyrcania and set in Robert E. Howard&#x27;s fictional Hyborian Age. Howard&#x27;s Conan the Barbarian also has various adventures set in this locale, including as a pirate on the inland sea.

<doc id="206431" wikidata="Q203995" url="?curid=206431" title="Southend-on-Sea">
<text>Southend-on-Sea (), commonly referred to as Southend (), is a coastal city and unitary authority area with borough status in south-eastern Essex, England. It lies on the north side of the Thames Estuary, east of central London. It is bordered to the north by Rochford and to the west by Castle Point. The city is one of the most densely populated places in the country outside of London. It is home to the longest pleasure pier in the world, Southend Pier, while London Southend Airport is located to the north of the city centre.

Southend-on-Sea originally consisted of a few fishermen&#x27;s huts and farm at the southern end of the village of Prittlewell. In the 1790s, the first buildings around what was to become the High Street of Southend were completed. In the 19th century, Southend&#x27;s status as a seaside resort grew after a visit from the Princess of Wales, Caroline of Brunswick, and the construction of both the pier and railway, allowing easier access from London. From the 1960s onwards, the city declined as a holiday destination. After the 1960s, much of the city centre was developed for commerce and retail, and many original structures were lost to redevelopment. As part of its reinvention, Southend became the home of the Access credit card, due to its having one of the UK&#x27;s first electronic telephone exchanges. An annual seafront airshow, which started in 1986 and featured a flypast by Concorde, used to take place each May until 2012.

Southend was granted city status by letters patent dated 26 January 2022 in memorial to the Conservative Member of Parliament for Southend West, Sir David Amess, a long-time supporter of city status for the borough, who was murdered on 15 October 2021. On 1 March 2022, the letters patent were presented to Southend Borough Council by Charles, Prince of Wales.

==History==
===Early history===
Southend was first recorded in 1309 as &quot;Stratende&quot;, a small piece of land in the Manor of Milton (now known as Westcliff-on-Sea), within the Parish of Prittlewell. Its next recorded mention was in a will from 1408, where the area south of Prittlewell was called &quot;Sowthende&quot;. In March 1665, the British naval ship, The London, blew up while moored just of South-end on its way to fight in the Second Anglo-Dutch War. The hamlet of South-end, a few fishermen&#x27;s huts and Thames Farm farmhouse stayed this way until the mid 18th century, when in 1758 a large house was built, which by 1764 had become the Ship Inn. The area was further developed by the building of oystermen cottages called Pleasant Row in 1767, and a year later the settlement was recorded in the parishes records for taxation purposes for the first time. The records also recorded a salt works and a lime kiln. A visitor to the settlement in 1780 said &quot;not anything in the worth place notice&quot;, but a year later the first bathing machine was brought to the hamlet. By 1785, the &quot;Chelmsford Chronicle&quot; were reporting that plans were being contemplated to build a hotel with the plan to make South-end,

Nothing came of the subscription but the Chronicle reported in 1787, &quot;Southend is likely to become a place of fashionable resort, and that there are a greater number of genteel families there this season than was ever known before&quot;. By the end of the decade, the number of bathing machines had increased, the hamlet was recorded as containing the Ship Inn and 25 houses and cottages, and reported visitors such as Lord Cholmondley.

===The start and fail of New South-End===

In 1790, the local lord of the Manor of both Prittlewell and Milton (now Westcliff-on-Sea) and landowner Daniel Scratton set aside 35-acres of land at the top of the cliffs to the west of South-end called Grove Field and the Grove. The site was split into three leasehold sites with 99 year leases, with the development called New South-End, and the original settlement being renamed Old South-end. A new road was created that cut through the development, which would later become the High Street. The Chelmsford Chronicle wrote at the time,

Scratton leased the parcels of land to building firm Pratt, Watt &amp; Louden and John Sanderson, an architect, both of Lambeth. Another site was leased from Scratton by Pratt, Watt &amp; Louden for a brick works for the development. The first house in Grove Terrace was completed by January 1792 and it was reported that the hotel had been roofed and 60 dwellings had been started on. By the summer two public houses, the Duke of York and the Duke of Clarence had opened. However, by September that year The Times was reporting that the resort was likely to attract the lower and middle classes, not the wealthy clientele that was being aimed at. At this time, Pratt, Watt &amp; Louden transferred the lease to Thomas Holland, a builder and solicitor from Grays Inn, however his finances were not sound and he was soon selling off building materials. By December 1792, the operators of the Duke of York, brewers Sea and Woollet closed the public house, but by September 1793 it was still in their ownership. The Grand Hotel, now known as The Royal Hotel opened on the 1st July 1793, and most of Grove Terrace was available to let. Later that year New South-End was listed for the first time by the parish for the annual rate, and by the summer of 1794 the Terrace, Grove Terrace, the Mews and Library had finally been completed. However, by February 1795, Thomas Holland had been declared bankrupt, and the property he owned was not sold by auction until 1797, with the Heygate family purchasing the buildings. John Sanderson, the other developer was also declared bankrupt, with only Grove House built, and his estate was not sold until 1802, with much of the site still open land. In contrast, Old South-end doubled in size during the same period including two public houses, the Ship Inn and the Anchor and Hope Inn, five shops and the Caroline baths. A large house was built by Abraham Vandervord in 1792 in Old South-end which would later become the Minerva public house.

===Growth of the town===
Due to the bad transportation links between Southend and London, there was not rapid development during the Georgian Era as there was in Brighton. Margate, although further away from London than Southend, offered cheaper boat and stagecoach fares and had more to offer the visitor. Development was piecemeal in the early 19th century, with a Theatre being built in Old South-end by Thomas Trotter in 1804. Southend was however mentioned in Jane Austen&#x27;s novel &quot;Emma&quot; of 1815. The resort first received Royal patronage in 1801 when Princess Charlotte of Wales visited to sea bathe on the order of her physician. Her mother, Princess Caroline of Brunswick stayed at 7-9 The Terrace during 1803, and in 1805 Lady Hamilton held a ball in the hotel assembly room in honour of Lord Nelson. The visit of Princess Caroline boosted Southend&#x27;s popularity with tourists. Travellers would often arrive by sailing boat or later by Thames steamer, which presented problems as boats could only dock during high tide. The Southend coast consists of mudflats that extend far from the shore, with a high tide depth that seldom exceeds . Large boats were unable to port near to the beach and no boats could approach at low tide. Many potential visitors would travel beyond Southend on to Margate or other resorts with better docking facilities. Due to this, local dignitaries led by the former Lord Mayor of the City of London Sir William Heygate, campaigned in the early 1820s to gain permission from parliament to build a pier. On the 7 May 1829, the House of Lords passed the Bill and it received Royal Assent on the 14 May. By July, Lord Mayor of London, Sir William Thompson laid the foundation stone, and the first section of the pier opened a year later. However, Southend was still a quiet health resort, as the pier did not extend far enough out and visitors had issues disembarking.

In June 1852, after several attempts at building a railway to Southend, Royal Assent was given to build the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway with the line finally opening at Southend in 1856. The line had been planned to terminate opposite the pier, however residents in The Royal Terrace opposed this, and the station was built further back. In 1859, the Grove Field area was leased to Sir Morton Peto, and with a consortium which included Thomas Brassey, the contractors for the railway construction, hired architects Banks &amp; Barry to design &quot;Clifftown&quot;. The first houses were made available for sale in 1871, with even the smaller properties offering a glimpse of the sea, and eventually the development would include the Clifftown Congregational Church, the Nelson Road shopping parade and Prittlewell Square, Southend&#x27;s first park. The arrival of the railway did not at first greatly increase visitor numbers, with Southend still being seen as quiet resort and not a noisy fashionable seaside town, with Benjamin Disraeli visiting regularly between 1833 and 1884, Prince Arthur visiting in 1868, while the Empress of France, Eugénie and her son, Louis-Napoléon, Prince Imperial also came to the town. However the growth of Southend saw a Local Board of Health be created in 1866, and the large steam powered Middleton brewery was opened by Henry Luker &amp; Co in 1869 to serve a growing population. Southend&#x27;s development as a resort however seem to stall, until the Bank Holidays Act of 1871 with holidays becoming available to more of the population. The growth in visitor numbers due to the new bill saw the Local Board purchase the pier in 1873, construct Marine Parade in 1878, while the cliffs west of the pier were purchased and transformed into tree lined walkways during 1886. In 1889, the Great Eastern Railway opened its station at Southend Victoria, and a new iron built replacement for the pier opened. The town was officially incorporated in 1892, with the Local Board of Health being replaced by a municipal corporation, and a year later added the &quot;on-sea&quot; to the town&#x27;s name. During 1892, the famous Southend department store Keddies opened its doors for the first time. Between 1871 and 1901 the towns population grew 100 fold from 2,800 to 29,000. Marine Park &amp; Gardens opened during 1894, which in 1901 was redeveloped into The Kursaal amusement park. In the same year, the Metropole Hotel opened on Pier Hill, which would later be renamed the Palace Hotel, while the town first received both electric street lighting and trams, and had fitted an electric staircase by Jesse W. Reno on the site of where the current Cliff lift is. 
To celebrate Queen Victoria&#x27;s diamond jubilee, a statue of her pointing out to sea was placed at the top of Pier Hill, although the locals stated she was pointing at the gents toilets! A foundation stone was laid by Lord Avebury in 1901 for the new Day Technical School, School of Art and Evening Class Institute with the completed building being opened by the Countess of Warwick a year later. The site had previously been planned to be home to a new joint town hall, library and school but spiraling costs had seen the town hall and library being dropped. In 1903, it was reported that around 1 million people had paid admission to use the pier, while 250,000 passengers had alighted from pleasure steamboats. Further facilities were built for the growing visitor numbers, including extending the esplanade to Chalkwell in 1903, and in 1909 adding the &quot;wedding cake&quot; bandstand at the top of the cliffs, opposite Prittlewell Square, which was one of six bandstands that stood in Southend. 
In 1909, an indoor roller-skating rink was opened in Warrior Square. The new facilities were not only serving the growing visitor numbers, but also the residents, with the inhabitants having grown by 1911 to 62,723, the fastest growing population in England, and was being regarded an Eastern suburb of London. During 1913, the Day Technical School split, with the girls moving to the new Southend High School for Girls at Boston Avenue, while the day technical school was renamed Southend High School for Boys. In 1914, the town gained county borough status, and the corporation formed the first police force.

===Southend during World War I===
Shortly after the declaration of war, the British government began the internment of German citizens and several thousand were held on three ships, the Royal Edward, Saxonia and the Ivernia which were moored off the pier until May 1915. The War Office selected a piece of land north of the town in 1914 for a new aerodrome, with Squadron no. 37 of the Royal Flying Corps moving in a year later. Many soldiers passed through Southend en route to the Western Front. The pier was frequently used to reach troop ships, with the Admiralty stationing a war signal station at the pierhead, and Southchurch Park was taken over as an army training ground. During the war, the public could still walk the length of the pier. As the war drew on, Southend also became an evacuation point for casualties and several hotels were converted to hospitals, including the Metropole into the Queen Mary Naval Hospital. Arthur Maitland Keddie, from the Keddies department store organised day trips for wounded soldiers from the Queen Mary Naval Hospital to Thundersley and Runwell. The town was first bombed by German Zeppelins on 10 May 1915 with the death of one woman, while a second attack happened on the 26 May again with one death. Another bombing raid by Gothas took place in 1917 with a further 33 deaths. When peace was confirmed in 1919, official celebrations were organised by the town. A large Naval review off the Southend shore took place, with a twenty-one gun salute being fired on Peace Day on the 23 July. The town organised a carnival, fetes and a firework display.

===Between the wars===
After the war Southend continued to grow in both residents and visitors, with many moving out of London to live in better conditions. Its population in 1921 was recorded as 106,050, but as the census was postponed to the summer months due to a planned general strike, it was greatly inflated by holidaymakers. The Corporation purchased three former German U-boat engines to generate power for the tram network, siting them at Leigh, London Road and Thorpe Bay. During 1924, the Sunken Gardens at the side of the pier became Peter Pan Playground, a children&#x27;s pleasure garden. The pier head was enlarged in 1929 with the Prince George extension, at a cost of £58,000, to manage the increasing number of visitors arriving by paddle steamer. A Southend icon, EKCO, opened their large factory at Priory Crescent on the site of a former cabbage patch in 1930. To cope with the increase demand for housing, estates like Earls Hall were built during 1930, with the Manners Way estate joining it just north along with a new road towards in Rochford in 1937. The London Taxi Drivers Charity for Children completed their first taxi drive to Southend in 1931, with 40 Hackney Carriages bringing children to the town, who were given 6d to spend on the seafront. At the 1931 Census the population of Southend was recorded at 110,790, however the town would grow further by absorbing South Shoebury district and parts of Rochford district in 1933. Southend tried their first autumn illuminations during 1935, following the example set in 1913 by Blackpool. The town became a favourite with motorcycle riders during the 1930s, with the phase, &quot;Promenade Percy&quot;, coming from this pastime. In the same year, the council purchased land on the Cliffs at Westcliff to build a 500 seater theatre and concert venue to be called Shorefield Pavilion with working starting four years later only to be suspended by the start of the war.

===Southend during World War II===
Southend became an essential part of the British war machine. In 1939, the Royal Navy had commandeered Southend Pier, renaming it HMS Leigh, with the army building a concrete platform on the Prince George extension to house anti-aircraft guns. The navy also took over the Royal Terrace for its personnel. The pier was used by the navy to help control the River Thames, along with the Thames Estuary 
boom that was built at Shoebury Garrison during 1939, and organised over 3,000 East Coast convoys by the end of the war. HMS Leigh was attacked by the Germans on the 22 November when they dropped magnetic mines and machine gunned the pier, but none of the mines caused any damage and the navy&#x27;s anti-aircraft guns destroyed one of the German planes. It was the last time there was a concentrated attack on the pier. Southend Airport was requisitioned by the RAF at the outbreak of war, becoming a satellite of Hornchurch and being renamed RAF Rochford. The town was believed to be the most heavily defended place in Essex, ranging from three and half miles of anti-tank cubes on the seafront, machine gun and anti-aircraft posts, road blocks and barrage balloons.

On 31 May 1940, six cockle fishing boats: the &quot;Endeavour&quot;, &quot;Letitia&quot;, &quot;Defender&quot;, &quot;Reliance&quot;, &quot;Renown&quot; and the &quot;Resolute&quot; were joined by the Southend lifeboat &quot;Greater London&quot; at the pier on their way to assist at the Dunkirk evacuation. The town itself was first hit by German bombing in May 1940, when the Nore Yacht club was hit while 10 soldiers were killed near the airport. Southend High School for Boys was hit in a raid in June 1940. By June 1940, much of the town was sealed off, with all bar 10% of the population that were engaged in essential services, evacuated and only military personnel remaining. A cordon of 20 miles was set up, with the town being designated part of the coastal defence area, but with the risk of invasion dropping, in 1941 it was reduced to 10 miles. By 28 October 1940, RAF Rochford had been renamed RAF Southend, no longer being a satellite of Hornchurch, although they still had Fighter Control at the base. A day later 264 Squadron arrived for night fighter duties equipped with the Boulton Paul Defiant. In the same month, a bombing raid damaged houses in the Fleetwood Avenue in Westcliff. During 1941, Prime Minister Winston Churchill visited Shoebury Garrison twice for weapon demonstrations, with the Experimental Establishment carrying out numerous trials of weird and wonderful weapons. An air raid in February 1941 destroyed the London Hotel in the High Street, while the foreshore was often used by German bomber aircraft as a dumping ground for their bomb loads during the war if their primary target was not possible to hit.

In 1942, the area along the seafront from the Pier to Chalkwell was transformed into HMS Westcliff, a huge naval transit and training camp run by Combined Operations. The police helped the Combined Operations Service find the owners of the empty properties so they could requisition properties to billet their staff. HMS Westcliff was officially opened, in secret, by Lord Mountbatten in 1943. The well known jeweller R.A. Jones store was damaged by bombing in October 1942. An amusing moment during the war was Lord Haw-Haw announcing in his radio broadcasts that German forces had sunk the British ships HMS Westcliff and HMS Leigh. The town started to fall under constant V1 and V2 rocket attacks until December 1944, with one hitting the Pavilion on the pier. In 1944, while towing a Mulberry harbour caisson to Goole in Hampshire, it was found to be leaking so it was brought into the Thames Estuary off Thorpe Bay to be checked, but after being left by the tugs, it moved partially into the channel, and without support of the mudflat snapped in half and remains there to this day. Further disaster happened when in August 1944, the liberty ship SS Richard Montgomery, with over 6,000 tonnes of explosive on board, lost its mooring off the Isle of Sheppey, opposite Southend, in strong winds and wedged itself onto the mudflat, breaking its back. Prior to this, HMS Leigh had been the mustering point for 576 ships in June 1944 before they headed for Normandy and D-Day. Force L, the follow up forces that were to follow the initial D-Day invasion force were located at Southend.

=== Decline and regeneration ===
After the war Southend soon opened up to visitors again, with pier officially being given permission to open by the Home Office in March 1945, although the Prince George Extension was still out of bounds to the public. The &quot;Chelmsford Chronicle&quot; reported that the public returned in their droves, with 79,000 visitors turning up in the first nineteen days, though it wasn&#x27;t until 30 September that the pier was officially derequisitioned by the Navy. The town, which had been heavily fortified, slowly started to remove the defences during 1945, however the dust and noise attracted unhappiness with the holidaymakers, with two elderly ladies complaining to the police that it should be stopped while they were on their vacation for the week. Many of the fairground attractions only opened at weekend due many of the men who worked them still being enlisted. It wasn&#x27;t until 1946 that the town started to return to normal, and by 1949-50 visitor numbers had returned with over 5.75 million visiting the pier alone. The visitors would have used the replaced pier railway, newly installed in 1949, or may have visited the newly opened Golden Hind replica containing waxworks by Louis Tussaud next to the pier. These numbers grew to a peak of 7 million the following year.

Southend would use the Kursaal and Pier as nodal attractions to promote the town to tourists during the 50s and 60s. On 31 January 1953, Southend seafront was affected by the North Sea flood, with Peter Pan&#x27;s Playground left underwater. However the town was not affected as badly as other parts of Essex. The town however was more joyous in June, with the town holding a week of celebrations to commemorate the Coronation of Elizabeth II. This included an air race at the airport featuring aerobatic displays by supersonic jets, a military tattoo, a coronation ball at the Kursaal featuring Ted Heath and his Music and a grand fireworks display on the seafront. In 1956, the Great Eastern line was electrified which encouraged more Londoners move to the town, further making it into a dormitory town for the capital. On 14 April 1955, Air Charter inaugurated its first vehicle ferry service between Southend and Calais using a Bristol 170 Mark 32 Super Freighter. It was the sign of the future for tourism in the town, with the British public moving from UK holidays to foreign vacations that saw the start of the downturn on for the British seaside towns, though Southend still had strong numbers visiting.

Between 1948 and 1962, it was recorded that 22% of the town&#x27;s population were working in holiday related industries. The council were concerned that the town was too reliant on tourism and being a dormitory town, that they decided to try and grow the commercial industry in the town, which coincided with plans in central government to de-centralise services. The Miles Report of 1944 had already identified Victoria Avenue as the perfect location for office development, and the council in 1960 finally started work on a new Civic Centre on land previously purchased to build a new further education college. The Civic Centre would encompass a new police station that opened in 1962, a courthouse in 1966, council offices and chamber in 1967, a new College in 1971 and a Library in 1974. The planned fire station was dropped and was eventually built in Sutton Road. These replaced cramped facilities located in Alexandra Road and Clarence Street. The council in 1960 put forward a redevelopment plan, called &quot;Prospect of Southend&quot; to central government, to improve both the commercial and retail growth in the town, but the original plan and an amendment, which requested compulsory purchase orders, were both rejected by the Minister for Housing Development and Local Government. Part of the plans included redeveloping the area north of the High Street, which included the Talza and Victoria Arcades, had been discussed with developer Hammerson. Although the plans were rejected by central government, Hammerson started a programme of buying property in the area, and in 1964 the council accepted Hammerson&#x27;s plans for the site. Hammerson had by this point had purchased 93% of the freeholds, with the council using Section 4 of the Town and Country Act 1962 to compulsory purchase the remaining properties. The development, which became Victoria Circus Shopping Centre, opened in 1970 and saw a large area of much loved Southend demolished.

Further developments put forward by the council included building a ring road around the town centre. First discussed by the council in 1955, plans were started to be developed in 1961, with the electrification of the London, Tilbury and Southend railway line acting as impetus as bridges over the line which were on the route of the planned ring road needed replacing. In 1965, the Ministry of Transport gave the council a grant of £869,986 to the planned cost of £1.2 million to build the North and East sections of the ring road. The council used compulsory purchase orders to buy up many of the properties along the planned route and work started in 1966, with the first section opening in 1967 with the first high pressure sodium street lamps in Britain. The West and South sections of the ring road were never completed. In the same year, work was started on dualing Victoria Avenue to Carnarvon Road, while part of the High Street was pedestrianised by 1968. By this point Victoria Avenue had seen further development, with offices opening along the section opposite the Civic Centre including Portcullis House in 1966, the first offices opened by HM Customs and Excise in the town.

In 1969, Southend-on-Sea Borough Police amalgamated with Essex Constabulary to become the Essex and Southend-on-Sea Joint Constabulary. This merger was campaigned against by the council and the local MPs. The town&#x27;s decline as a holiday resort continued, with the visitor numbers on the pier falling to a million during 1969-70 and the attraction lost £45,000. The town saw the number of visitors had fallen from the 1950s by 73%, which was against the backdrop of more Brits travelling abroad, growing from just 1.5 million holidays in 1951, to 4.2 million by 1971. The pier slowly began to decline and with it the structure began to deteriorate. In 1971, a child&#x27;s injury prompted a survey, leading to repairs and replacement to much of the pier railway throughout the decade. In response, the council allocated £370,000 over two years, starting in 1972, to ensure the pier remained maintained, however the pier head burnt down in 1976 and in 1978 the pier railway was closed due to its poor condition. Prior to the pier railway closure, the Kursaal closed the majority of the amusement park in 1973.

The town became one of the earliest to receive an electronic telephone exchange in 1971, and by 1972 Access, Britain&#x27;s second credit card, opened their offices in the former EKCO site in Priory Crescent. A year later HM Customs and Excise opened the central offices for the collection of VAT. In 1972, Southend Air Museum opened its doors for the first time at Aviation Way. This was against the backdrop of the government planning to build a new airport on Maplin Sands at Foulness Island, which the council purchased a share in the consortium of developers hoping to shape the benefits for the town, but the airport plans were pulled by the new Labour government in 1974. During 1976, plans called &quot;Prospects 1976&quot; was released to improve the town&#x27;s ability to attract holidaymakers, including bastions with facilities at Chalkwell and Westcliff, but they never got off the drawing board.

In 1980, the town&#x27;s reinvention as a commercial centre had seen it shrug off its tag as a dormitory town for London, however the future of the pier was in doubt and a campaign, which included Sir John Betjeman, pushed the council to keep the pier open. The pier may have been saved, now run by Lecorgne Amusements, but the town lost another attraction in 1983, when the Southend Aircraft Museum closed for the final time. However in the same year the council put up £800,000 with the Historic Buildings Fund investing £200,000 in restoring the pier. Further invest saw a new narrow gauge railway fitted to the pier, which was reopened by Princess Anne on 2 May 1986. A contract was given to Brent Walker to run the pier in 1986, but in September of that year it was damaged by the ship &quot;Kings Abbey&quot;, destroying the lifeboat station. Two years later, management of the pier returned to the council. The seafront would see several plans put forward in the late 70s and the 1980s to build a marina on the seafront by numerous developers including Brent Walker, including an artificial island alongside the pier, though the council ended the plans after they were objected to by the RSPB due to loss of intertidal areas for wildlife was deemed to much. Plans were resurrected again in 2020 for a marina off the coast at Shoeburyness. In May 1986, the Southend Airshow was started, featuring a fly past by Concorde, and after the first year where entry was charged by the council, it would grow to become Europe&#x27;s biggest free airshow. The final show took place on 2012, with the council announcing in January 2013 it could no longer afford to run the show. An attempt to revive the show for September 2015, as the Southend Airshow and Military Festival, failed.

The town started to regenerate its visitor attractions, with the Sealife Centre opening in 1993. In 1995, the owners of Peter Pan&#x27;s Playground purchased the land East of the pier and started to expand, creating Adventure Island, being rated best-value amusement park in Britain in 2024. The Kursaal, was purchased by Brent Walker in 1988 with plans to redevelop the site as a water theme park, but the company entered liquidation and the site remained empty. The council purchased the Kursaal, and after a multimillion-pound redevelopment by the Rowallan Group, the main Kursaal building was reopened in 1998 with a bowling alley, a casino and other amusements. In 2003, during excavations for a road widening scheme at Priory Crescent, an Anglo-Saxon royal burial was found dating from the 6th century, with a display of the finds displayed at Southend Central Museum since 2019. The road widening was cancelled after a campaign known as Camp Bling. A year earlier there was a slippage on the Cliffs, which saw the bandstand close. The cliffs were stabilised in 2013, with the council planning to build a new museum at the location to host the Anglo Saxon discoveries, as well as the Central Museum and Beecroft Art Gallery, but in 2018 it was abandoned due to rising costs. The town&#x27;s commercial growth during the 60s and 70s, declined with the departure of many of their former tenants, including HM Revenue and Customs in 2022, and many of the former offices have been converted to apartments.

===The formation of the city===
On 15 October 2021, the Member of Parliament for Southend West, Sir David Amess, was fatally stabbed during a constituency meeting in Leigh-on-Sea. On 18 October 2021, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the Queen had agreed to grant Southend-on-Sea with city status as a memorial to Amess, who had long campaigned for this status to be granted. Preparations, led by Amess, for Southend to enter a competition for city status in 2022 as part of the Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee were underway at the time of his death. A &quot;City Week&quot; was held throughout the town between 13 and 20 February 2022, beginning with the inaugural &quot;He Built This City&quot; concert named in honour of Amess. The concert was held at the Cliffs Pavilion and included performers such as Digby Fairweather, Lee Mead, and Leanne Jarvis. Other events such as a city ceremony and the Southend LuminoCity Festival of Light were held during the week. Sam Duckworth, who knew Amess personally, performed at some of the events. On 1 March, Southend Borough Council was presented letters patent from the Queen, by Charles, Prince of Wales, officially granting the borough city status. Southend became the second city in the ceremonial county of Essex, after Chelmsford, which was granted city status in 2012.

==Geology==
The seven kilometres of cliffs from Hadleigh Castle to Southend Pier consist of London Clay overlaid in the Ice age by sand, gravel and river alluvium. The cliffs have been affected by slip planes affected by groundwater, with major slips having occurred in 1956, 1962, 1964 and 1969. In 2001, a small slippage occurred, which was followed by a major slippage in November 2002, which irreparably damaged the cliffs bandstand and restaurant. At a later date, a report came to light from a month before the slip which showed there was already signs of a slippage. A £2.8 million cliffs stabilisation programme was completed in 2013. In May 2023, work started to investigate further slippage at Belton Hills in Leigh-on-Sea, with remedy work said to cost £500,000.

The British Geological Survey provided a summary in 1986 of the geology of the country around Southend and Foulness:

==Governance==
===Current administration===
Southend is governed by Southend-on-Sea City Council, which is a unitary authority, performing the functions of both a county and district council. There is one civil parish within the city at Leigh-on-Sea, which has a Town Council that was established in 1996. The rest of the city is an unparished area. The city is split into seventeen wards, with each ward returning three councillors. The 51 councillors serve four years and one third of the council is elected each year, followed by one year without election. As of the 2024 local elections a coalition led by Labour run the council.

===Administrative history===

Southend&#x27;s first elected council was a local board, which held its first meeting on 29 August 1866. Prior to that the town was administered by the vestry for the wider parish of Prittlewell. The local board district was enlarged in 1877 to cover the whole parish of Prittlewell.

The town was made a municipal borough in 1892. In 1897 the borough was enlarged to also include the neighbouring parish of Southchurch, with further enlargement in 1913 by taking over the area formerly controlled by Leigh-on-Sea Urban District Council. In 1914 the enlarged Southend became a county borough making it independent from Essex County Council and a single-tier of local government. The county borough was enlarged in 1933 by the former area of Shoeburyness Urban District and part of Rochford Rural District.

Southend Civic Centre was designed by borough architect, Patrick Burridge, and officially opened by the Queen Mother on 31 October 1967.

On 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, Southend became a district of Essex, with the county council once more providing county-level services to the town. In 1990, Southend was the first local authority to outsource its municipal waste collection to a commercial provider. However, in 1998 it again became the single tier of local government when it became a unitary authority.

Upon receiving city status on 1 March 2022, the council voted to rename itself &#x27;Southend-on-Sea City Council&#x27;.

===Coat of Arms and Twinning===
The Latin motto, &#x27;Per Mare Per Ecclesiam&#x27;, emblazoned on the municipal coat of arms, translates as &#x27;By [the] Sea, By [the] Church&#x27;, reflecting Southend&#x27;s position between the church at Prittlewell and the sea as in the Thames estuary. The city has been twinned with the resort of Sopot in Poland since 1999 and has been developing three-way associations with Lake Worth Beach, Florida.

===Members of Parliament===
====Current MPs====
Due to boundary changes, the seats in Southend changed at the 2024 election to Southend East and Rochford and Southend West and Leigh.

In the 2024 United Kingdom general election, Bayo Alaba of Labour won 38.8% of the vote to win the seat of Southend East and Rochford, with a 57% turnout. The new MP for Southend West and Leigh is David Burton-Sampson of Labour, who won 35.6% of the vote on a turnover of 63%. This was the first time since the initial seat in parliament was created in 1918, that Labour have been elected, as the city had previously been held by the Conservatives.

====Former MPs====
From the creation of the first Member of Parliament seat for Southend in 1918, there has been a history of long serving MPs. Rupert Guinness of the Guinness family was Southend&#x27;s first MP, and only stepped down when he was given a peerage. His wife, Gwendolen Guinness replaced him in 1927, until she retired and her son-in-law Henry Channon replaced her in 1935, serving until his death in 1958. Because of the Guinness connection, the seat became known in the media as &quot;Guinness-on-Sea&quot;.

In 1950, the one seat was split into two, Southend East and Southend West due to the growth in the town.

Sir Stephen McAdden served as the MP for Southend East from 1950 until his death in 1979. His replacement Sir Teddy Taylor served Southend East, then its replacement seat Rochford and Southend East from 1980 until he retired in 2005. James Duddridge served as Sir Teddy&#x27;s replacement from 2005 until stepping down at the 2024 election.

Paul Channon, son of Henry replaced his father as the MP for Southend West from 1959 until he stepped down in 1997. He was replaced by Sir David Amess, who served from 1997 until his murder in 2021. Anna Firth of the Conservatives had replaced Amess at the by-election in January 2022 with 86% of the vote but lost her seat at the 2024 election.

==Demography==
===Population density===
Southend is the seventh most densely populated area in the United Kingdom outside of the London Boroughs, with 38.8 people per hectare compared to a national average of 3.77.

====Greater Urban Area====

The greater urban area of Southend spills outside of the borough boundaries into the neighbouring Castle Point and Rochford districts, including the towns of Hadleigh, Benfleet, Rayleigh and Rochford, as well as the villages of Hockley and Hullbridge. According to the 2011 census, it had a population of 295,310.

===Deprivation===
Save the Children&#x27;s research data shows that for 2008–09, Southend had 4,000 children living in poverty, a rate of 12%, the same as Thurrock, but above the 11% child poverty rate of Essex as a whole.

The Department for Communities and Local Government&#x27;s 2010 Indices of Multiple Deprivation Deprivation Indices data showed that Southend is one of Essex&#x27;s most deprived areas. Out of 32,482 Lower Super Output Areas in England, area 014D in the Kursaal ward is 99th, area 015B in Milton ward is 108th, area 010A in Victoria ward is 542nd, and area 009D in Southchurch ward is 995th, as well as an additional 5 areas all within the top 10% most deprived areas in England (with the most deprived area having a rank of 1 and the least deprived a rank of 32,482). Victoria and Milton wards have the highest proportion of ethnic minority residents – at the 2011 Census these figures were 24.2% and 26.5% respectively. Southend has the highest percentage of residents receiving housing benefits (19%) and the third highest percentage of residents receiving council tax benefits in Essex.

===Employment and unemployment===
As of May 2024, The Office of National Statistics have recorded the following employment, unemployment and economic inactivity in Southend-on-Sea.

In the 2021 census, it was reported that 69.1% of the working population work in full-time employment, with 10.9% working more than 48 hours a week.

===Population statistics===
As of the 2021 census, the population was recorded as 180,686, with 51.3% of the population being female, and 48.7% recorded as male.

The following table shows the breakdown of the population by age:
In the census it was reported that 87.5% of the population were born in the UK, while for those who were born outside of the country, most were born in Europe, and most had lived in the UK for more than 10 years. The census reported that nearly 33,000 of the population were retired.

A fifth of the working population commutes to London daily. Wages for jobs based in Southend were the second lowest among UK cities in 2015. It also has the fourth-highest proportion of people aged over 65. This creates considerable pressure on the housing market. It is the 11th most expensive place to live in Britain.

==Economy==
===Current industry===
Tourism is still a key industry in Southend, with over 7,500 employed people in the sector, which counts as 15.9% of jobs in the city. In 2019, it was reported that 253,900 people had stayed, generating £53.4 million while over 7.3 million day visitors had contributed over £308 million to the economy. Rossi&#x27;s Ice-cream is a famous Southend institution, having existed since 1932.

Aerospace is another key industry. Southend is one of EasyJet&#x27;s 10 bases in the UK. In addition to flights, Southend has several aircraft maintenance firms including Inflite MRO Services, and in Ipeco, have a former London Stock Exchange listed international aircraft seat and airframe manufacturer headquartered in the city since 1960. In 2024, Ipeco was awarded The King&#x27;s Awards for Enterprise for promoting opportunity.

Other manufacturing companies based in Southend include MK Electric, who relocated there in 1961 and in 2014 had seen the 100 millionth socket made at the factory, and Olympus UK &amp; Ireland (formerly Keymed), who specialise in medical equipment and have been in Southend since 1969.

Another major employment area in Southend is Financial Services, with NatWest&#x27;s credit card operations located in Thanet Grange. In 2006, travel insurance company InsureandGo relocated its offices from Braintree to Maitland House in Southend-on-Sea. The company brought 120 existing jobs from Braintree and announced the intention to create more in the future. However the business announced the plan to relocate to Bristol in 2016. The company however as of 2021 is still located in Southend. The building is now also home to Ventrica, a customer service outsourcing company.

Southend has industrial parks located at Progress Road, Comet and Aviation Way in Eastwood and Stock Road in Sutton. Firms located in Southend include Hi-Tec Sports.

As of 2023, large employers (those employing more than 250 people) made up only 0.4% of companies within the city, while micro employers (9 or less employees) make up 90.8%, which is 1.2% greater than the East of England average.

===Former notable industry===
EKCO was an electronics manufacturer formed by local, Eric Kirkham Cole in 1926. The business started at factory in Leigh-on-Sea, before opening a larger site at Priory Crescent in 1930. The company expanded from radio production into televisions, radar and plastics, and employed over 8,000 people in Southend at its height. In 1960, EKCO merged with Pye to form British Electronic Industries Ltd, but due to several financial issues, the television and radio manufacturing on the site was closed in 1966 with the loss of 800 jobs. Pye of Cambridge (British Electronic Industries was renamed in 1963) was purchased by Philips in 1967. The offices and radio factory was sold to the Joint Credit Card Company in 1972, however EKCO Plastics continued to operate from the site. EKCO Plastics had been a separate subsidiary, and had won awards from the Design Council and the Duke of Edinburgh for their products. Pye sold Ekco Plastics to National Plastics, a subsidiary of Courtaulds, in 1978. Linpac purchased National Plastics subsidiary NP Ekco in 1986. Linpac became Ecomold, but closed the factory after it fell into administration in 2008. After the Ecomold factory closed, the whole site was converted into Ekco Park, a 231 home estate. A statue of Eric Cole was placed in his honour on the estate during 2020.

The Joint Credit Card Company was created by Lloyds Bank, Midland Bank and National Westminster Bank, and operated as the Access credit card. It was the second credit card company launched in the UK, becoming available during 1972. The company purchased the former EKCO television and radio factory on Priory Crescent from owners Philips to operate from. The company would expand by opening further offices across the city. In 1989, the company was renamed as Signet Ltd in 1989, along with a change to allow member banks to process their own customers as part of a Competition and Monopolies Commission review into credit cards. In the same year, processing was transferred to a new site in Basildon, while offices across Southend were transferred to the member banks. This included Esplanade House to NatWest, Chartwell House to Midland Bank/HSBC and Essex House to Lloyds Bank. In 1991, the business was sold to First Data Resources, and the Priory Crescent site was sold to Royal Bank of Scotland. The credit card industry in Southend declined with HSBC closing their operations in 2011, while Lloyds Bank joined them by closing Essex House in 2013. Royal Bank of Scotland/NatWest however stayed, and moved to a new purpose built building at Thanet Grange in 2003.

C. E. Heath moved to Southend during 1966 into the purpose built Heath House on Victoria Avenue. C. E. Heath was one of the largest insurance brokers in the world. The company also operated offices in Sutton Road and had a social club in Wellstead Gardens. In 1996, redundancies saw the number of staff drop from 600 to 300. However six years later, C. E. Heath merged with Lambert Fenchurch Group and announced closure of the Southend office. The property remained empty until 2016 when it was converted into flats.

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) previously employed over 4,000 people in Southend in Alexandra House and Portcullis House, which sat side by side on Victoria Avenue, and Tylers House/Dencora Court, Tylers Avenue. A training centre was located in Carby House, also in Victoria Avenue. In 2008, it was announced that both Tylers House and Portcullis House would be surplus to requirements. Tylers House would close, with the space rented out by HMRC to other government departments. HMRC announced in 2015 that they would be closing its Southend office and transferring the operations to Stratford. Portcullis House closed first in 2008, and in 2019 the site was purchased by Weston Homes to develop into 217 flats. Alexandra House has since closed and in late 2023 planning permission was being sought to convert the building into 557 flats by Comer Group.

Flightline was an airline, maintenance and aircraft sales company that operated out of London Southend Airport, which went into administration in 2008.

The business operated five stores under the Essex Furniture brand within Essex, and expanded nationally to 28 stores under The Furniture Workshop nameplate. In 1998, the company experienced financial difficulties, closing their Southend factory before their shares being suspended on the London Stock Exchange, announcing a £3.7 million loss in the first half of 1998. The company entered insolvency later that year.

===Utilities history===
====Electricity====
Southend-on-Sea County Borough Corporation provided the borough with electricity from the early twentieth century up to 1966 from the Southend power station in London Road. Upon nationalisation of the electricity industry in 1948, ownership passed to the British Electricity Authority and later to the Central Electricity Generating Board. Electricity connections to the national grid rendered the 5.75 megawatt (MW) power station redundant. Electricity was generated by diesel engines and by steam obtained from the exhaust gases. The power station closed in 1966 and in its final year of operation it delivered 2,720 MWh of electricity to the borough.

====Gas====
In 1853, a new company, Southend Gas Company, was set up to build a coal gas works to supply Southend. The works opened on Eastern Esplanade in 1855, and helped with the development of the then fledgling town. The company was purchased by Southend Corporation after the First World War, with its own landing pier locally known as Southend Pier Junior. The company was nationalised in 1949 and was transferred to the North Thames Gas Board, who in 1960 added the brutalist Esplanade House to the site as offices. The site stopped producing coal gas in 1968, and the works was demolished. Esplanade House, was taken over by Access credit card operations in the 1980s, but by the 1990s they had moved out and the gas works site remained empty until it was demolished to make way for a Premier Inn in 2014.

====Water====
Southend Waterworks Company was formed by Thomas Brassey in 1865, initially to provide water for the steam engines on the new railway line that opened in 1856, and to which Brassey was involved with. The company constructed the city&#x27;s first deep borehole in Milton Road, which would be known as Southend No.1 Well, along with a reservoir to hold 300,000 gallons. In 1870, Brassey died, and a limited company was formed to take over the works. In 1879, the Southend Water Bill was passed to incorporate the company to allow it to raise the necessary cash to expand the supply to the growing town, and to be able to charge rates per home based on the properties value. The company created further boreholes in and around Southend, including Vange, where a treatment works was built to soften the water from the five boreholes located in Vange and Fobbing, with a first of its kind lime recovery plant. During 1896, the water supply was tested due to a rising issue with Typhoid fever in the town. The investigation, led by Dr. R. Bruce Low, concluded that the water quality was good, but it was poor sanitation, with issues with the identified with the town&#x27;s sewer system and discharge onto the beach. The sewer system had been found to be wanting at a previous investigation in 1890 by Dr Thresh, and the town council was investing £35,000 to upgrade and improve the sewers. In 1907, the company&#x27;s boundaries were extended by the government to incorporate the areas of both Leigh on Sea Urban District Council and Billericay Rural District Council.

By 1920, the limit had been meet by how much water could be extracted from the boreholes in the chalk, and in 1921 a joint application with neighbouring water firm South Essex Waterworks was raised to extract water from the River Chelmer and the River Blackwater at Langford. That scheme was rejected, but a further application resulted in the Southend Waterworks Act of 1924 which was passed by parliament allowed the company to extract river water at Langford. The supply at Langford was pumped to reservoirs built at Oakwood on the Belfairs/Daws Heath border. In the late 1940s, both Southend Waterworks Company and South Essex Waterworks jointly planned a new large reservoir in the Sandon Valley, south of Chelmsford. Work started in 1951, which included the demolition of the hamlet of Peasdown near South Hanningfield. Hanningfield Reservoir opened in 1957 at a cost of £6 million. In 1970, the Essex Water Order was passed by parliament which saw Southend Waterworks Company and South Essex Waterworks merge to create the Essex Water Company. The company became Essex and Suffolk Water in 1994.

===Retail===

Southend High Street runs from the top of Pier Hill in the South, to Victoria Circus in the north. It currently has two shopping centres. The Victoria (built during the 1960s and a replacement for the old Talza Arcade, Victoria Arcade and Broadway Market) is located at the north end of the High Street. The Royals Shopping Centre is located at the south end of the High Street, was designed by the Building Design Partnership, with construction starting in 1985. The centre was officially opened in March 1988 by singer-actor Jason Donovan. The centre replaced the south end of High Street and Grove Road, and saw the demolition of the Ritz Cinema and Grand Pier Hotel. Prior to the opening, Morrissey filmed the video for his top ten charting track &quot;Everyday Is Like Sunday&quot; in the centre. Southend High Street mainly consists of chain stores, with Boots located in the Royals, while Next anchor the Victoria. However, since the covid pandemic the amount of empty shops in the city centre has increased greatly, with the High Street being called a ghost town.

A business that started in Southend during 1937 and is still active in 2024 is Dixons Retail, now renamed Currys plc.

The city of Southend has shopping in other areas. The Broadway in Leigh-on-Sea is known for its independent boutiques and coffee shops. Leigh Road in Leigh-on-Sea, Southchurch Road and London Road are where many of Southend&#x27;s independent businesses now reside. Hamlet Court Road, Westcliff-on-Sea was once known as the Bond Street of Essex, and is full of historical buildings, having been made into a conservation area in 2021. The road hosts the In Harmony festival each year.

There are regular vintage fairs and markets in Southend, held at a variety of locations including the Leigh Community Centre and Garon Park. A record fair is frequently held at West Leigh Schools in Leigh on Sea.

==== York Road Market ====

Demolition of the historic Victorian covered York Road market began on 23 April 2010, with the site becoming a car park. A temporary market had been held there every Friday until 2012 after the closure of the former Southend market at the rear of the Odeon. As of 2013, a market started to be held in the High Street every Thursday with over 30 stalls, with a further Saturday market being started in 2023.

As of 2014, the Office for National Statistics reported that Southend&#x27;s gross value added to the economy was as follows:
==Transport==

===Airport===

London Southend Airport was developed from the military airfield at Rochford; it was opened as a civil airport in 1935. The airport was the UK&#x27;s third-busiest airport during the 1960s, behind Heathrow and Manchester, before passenger numbers dropped off in the 1970s. In 2008, Stobart Group bought the lease for £21 million, becoming part of the Stobart Air division of the Stobart Group, who completed a rebuilding of the airport during 2010. It now offers scheduled flights to destinations across Europe, corporate and recreational flights, aircraft maintenance and training for pilots and engineers. It is served by Southend Airport railway station, on the Shenfield–Southend line, part of the Great Eastern Main Line.
===Buses===
Local bus services are provided by two main companies. Arriva Southend was formerly the council-owned Southend-on-Sea Corporation Transport and First Essex Buses was formerly Eastern National/Thamesway. Smaller providers include Stephensons of Essex. Southend-on-Sea Corporation Transport had been started by the council as a Tram service in 1901, before moving into Trolleybuses and Motorbuses, before being sold off to British Bus in 1993.

Southend has a bus station, known as the Southend Travel Centre, on Chichester Road, which was developed from a temporary facility added in the 1970s in 2006. The previous bus station was located on London Road and was run by Eastern National, but it was demolished in the 1980s to make way for a Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket. Arriva Southend is the only bus company based in Southend, with their depot located in Short Street; it was previously sited on the corner of London Road and Queensway and also a small facility in Tickfield Road. First Essex&#x27;s buses in the Southend area are based out of the depot in Hadleigh but, prior to the 1980s, Eastern National had depots on London Road (at the bus station) and Fairfax Drive.
 First Essex run the Essex Airlink bus service from the Southend Travel Centre to London Stansted.

===Railway===

Southend is served by two lines on the National Rail network:

* Running from Southend Victoria north out of the city is the Shenfield–Southend line, a branch of the Great Eastern Main Line, operated by Abellio Greater Anglia. Services operate to London Liverpool Street, via .
* Running from , in the east of the borough, is the London, Tilbury and Southend line operated by c2c. It runs west through , , to London Fenchurch Street, either via and or and . Additionally, one service from Southend Central each weekday evening terminates at Liverpool Street.

From 1910 to 1939, the London Underground&#x27;s District line&#x27;s eastbound service ran as far as Southend and Shoeburyness.

Besides its main line railway connections, Southend is also the home of two smaller railways. The Southend Pier Railway provides transport along the length of Southend Pier, whilst the nearby Southend Cliff Railway provides a connection from the promenade to the cliff top above.

===Roads===
Two A-roads connect Southend with London and the rest of the country: the A127 (&quot;Southend Arterial Road&quot;), via Basildon and Romford, and the A13, via Thurrock and London Docklands. Both are major routes; however, within the borough, the A13 is now a single carriageway local single-carriageway route, whereas the A127 is an entirely dual-carriageway. Both connect to the M25 and eventually London.

==Climate==

Southend-on-Sea is one of the driest places in the UK. It has a marine climate with summer highs of around and winters highs being around . Summer temperatures are generally slightly cooler than those in London. Frosts are occasional. During the 1991–2020 period there was an average of 29.6 days of air frost. Rainfall averaged .

==Education==

===Secondary schools===
Southend has a mixture of secondary school offerings. The mainstream secondary schools are mixed-sex comprehensives, including Belfairs Academy; Cecil Jones Academy; Chase High School; Southchurch High School; Shoeburyness High School and The Eastwood Academy.

In 2004, Southend retained the grammar school system and has four such schools: Southend High School for Boys; Southend High School for Girls; Westcliff High School for Boys and Westcliff High School for Girls.

Additionally, there are two single-sex schools assisted by the Roman Catholic Church: St Bernard&#x27;s High School (girls) and St Thomas More High School (boys).

===Higher and further education===
The main higher education provider in Southend is the University of Essex which has a campus in Elmer Approach, that opened in 2007 and is on the site of the former Odeon cinema. The University has operated from the city since 2003 when they opened a new satellite campus at Princess Caroline House in the High Street. It also operates the East 15 Acting School Southend campus at the Clifftown Theatre.

In addition to a number of secondary schools that offer further education, the largest provider is South Essex College in a purpose-built building in the centre of town. Formerly known as South East Essex College, (and previously Southend Municipal College) the college changed name in January 2010 following a merger with Thurrock and Basildon College.

Additionally there is PROCAT, (an arm of South Essex College) that is based at Progress Road, while learners can travel to USP College (formerly SEEVIC College) in Thundersley. The East 15 Acting School, a drama school has its second campus in Southend, while the Southend Adult Community College is in Ambleside Drive. Southend United Futsal &amp; Football Education Scholarship, located at Southend United&#x27;s stadium Roots Hall, provides education for sports scholarships.

===Formation of education in the city===
====Primary education====
The first school in the city opened in Prittlewell in 1727, after the Reverend Case campaigned for one to be setup. Land was provided by the Lord of the Manor Daniel Scratton in North Street for establishment of a school, and by 1739, Scratton had donated a further 21 acres of land. The school was by subscription of 1d a week, with 16 free places provided, and the remainder of the funding provided by a partial subscription of the parish and collections at St Mary&#x27;s. The Parliamentary commission into charities of 1819-37 described the school as &quot;The premises consists of a house of lath and plaster, situate in the village near the bridge; it comprises a schoolroom of about 30ft. in length and 20ft. in breadth, and several other rooms which are appropriated to the use of the schoolmaster&quot;.

After Southend became a separate ecclesiastical district in 1842, the church of St. John&#x27;s the Baptist founded the subscription National School in 1855 in Lower Southend. By 1876, the Board of Education called for a local board of education be set up and extra places be created. At the time of their report Southend had the following schools providing education for under 12s:
* Prittlewell Church of England - 175 pupils
* British School - 233 pupils
* Miss Felton&#x27;s Infant School - 7 pupils 
* Grovesnor School - 54 pupils
It was reported that the National School had closed and that Southend required a further 220 places. Many parishioners were against a local school board being set up, but Daniel Scratton was for the development, and by 1877 the Prittlewell School Board was formed.

By 1879, a new school was created called the London Road Schools which had places for over 500 pupils, and Prittlewell Church of England school had moved to East Street. However, by 1892, with further expansion of Southend, the Brewery Road School (now called Porters Grange) opened, followed by Leigh Road (which would become Hamlet Court County School) in 1897, Southchurch Hall in 1904, Bournemouth Park in 1907 and Chalkwell Park in 1909. The local board was dissolved by the Education Act of 1902 and replaced by the education committee of the council.

====Secondary and further education====
The Science and Art Department formation in 1853 had seen the government push for education in art, science, technology, and design in Britain and Ireland. The movement did not arrive in Southend until 1882 when two evening classes were set up at the London Road Schools for Art and Physiology. By 1883 the classes were moved to Clarence Street in a building shared with the council.

The Technical Instruction Act of 1889 and 1891 allowed councils to provide evening classes for technical subjects. The local board set up the Technical Instruction Committee, and soon classes were started at the council offices in Clarence Road. They were extremely popular, and the following year the newly created Southend Corporation purchased further land in Clarence Road to build a Technical Institute. In 1895 the foundation stone was laid, but prior to it opening it was decided to also open a day technical school for about 20 pupils, influenced by the Bryce commission of 1894. The first headmaster was J Hitchcock from Woolwich and was supported by one assistant teacher. A one-day a week art school was opened, which by 1899 was a fully organised art college.

The Day Technical School soon outgrew the Clarence Road site, and in 1902 a new building opened at Victoria Circus to host them, the Evening Technical Institute and the School of Art. In 1907, Essex County Council formed a new Higher Education committee, who decided that education should be split into separate boys and girls schools. In 1912, a foundation stone was laid in Boston Avenue for a new girls school, and a year later the girls left the Day Technical School to the new Southend High School for Girls. The Day Technical School was renamed as Southend High School for Boys. In 1914, Southend became a County Borough, taking charge of all education in the town, including the High School, School of Art and the Evening class institute all located still in the same building. After the war the number of pupils increased, so in 1919 the School of Art moved out of the top floor to make room for the High School, into temporary wooden buildings at the rear of the building. In 1920, The Commercial School was a co-educational school opened for the town’s rapidly expanding population in Bellsfield, a former large house located on Victoria Avenue. Two years later, the school&#x27;s name changed from The Commercial School to Westcliff High School, and by 1926, boys attending the school had moved to the school&#x27;s present site on Kenilworth Gardens, becoming Westcliff High School for Boys. The accompanying girls&#x27; school, Westcliff High School for Girls, remained on the Victoria Avenue site until 1930, following their relocation to the same site as Westcliff High School for Boys. The plans for the purchased land at the corner of Victoria Avenue and Carnarvon Road was changed in 1934 when it was decided to use this as the site of a new town hall.

In 1922, the School of Art grew by adding a School of Architecture The School of Art would become the nucleus of the newly formed Southend Technical and Commercial School. A Junior Technical department was opened at Fairfax Drive in 1929, but moved to Victoria Circus in 1934 to make way for Fairfax Senior Mixed School, and in 1935 the Technical and Commercial school was renamed Southend Municipal College,&lt;ref name=&quot;ECC/33&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; who took over the whole site after Southend High School for Boys moved to Prittlewell Chase in 1938. The college was restructured in 1963 to include in its teaching commercial and industrial skills for education in courses like plumbing, and renamed as the Southend College of Technology. The college became South East Essex College of Arts and Technology (SEECAT) in 1991, with the college formally merged with Thurrock and Basildon College on 1 January 2010 and was renamed South Essex College.

==Sport==
Southend United is the only professional club in the city. The club was formed in 1906 and has played as high as English football&#x27;s second tier. It currently competes in the Vanarama National League, after dropping out of the Football League at the end of the 2020–21 season, after 101 years of participation.

==Entertainment and culture==

===Southend Pleasure Pier===

Southend-on-Sea is home to the world&#x27;s longest pleasure pier, originally built in 1830 from wood before being replaced in iron during 1889. The pier stretches some from shore into the Thames Estuary and is a Grade II listed building. Sir John Betjeman, English poet and broadcaster, once said that &quot;the Pier is Southend, Southend is the Pier&quot;. The pier has been home to a narrow gauge railway since 1846.

===Kursaal===
The Kursaal was one of the earliest theme parks, opening in 1901. It closed in the 1970s and much of the land was developed as housing. The entrance hall, a listed building, was redeveloped to house a bowling alley operated by Megabowl and casino in 1998. However the bowling alley closed in 2019 and the casino closed in 2020. The building currently stands unused, and in May 2024, The Victorian Society listed the Kursaal amongst their 10 at risk sites that need rescuing.

===Southend Carnival===
Southend Carnival has been an annual event since 1906, where it was part of the annual regatta, and was set up to raise funds for the Southend Victoria Cottage Hospital. In 1926, a carnival association was formed, and by 1930, they were raising funds for the building of the new General Hospital with a range of events, including a fete in Chalkwell Park. The parades, which included a daylight and torchlight parades were cut down to just a torchlight parade during the 1990s. The carnival has not run since 2020, although attempts have been made to restart the parade, however the accompanying fair returned in 2023.

===Cliff Lift===

A short funicular railway, constructed in 1912, links the seafront to the High Street level of the town. The line runs on the site of a pioneering moving walkway, a forerunner of today&#x27;s escalator. This was constructed in 1901 by the American engineer Jesse W. Reno, but soon proved noisy and unreliable due its exposed location. The lift re-opened to the public in 2010, following a period of refurbishment.

===Other seafront attractions===
An amusement park Adventure Island, formerly known as Peter Pan&#x27;s Playground, straddles the pier entrance. The seafront houses the &quot;Sea-Life Adventure&quot; aquarium.

As of May 2024, Southend has four Keep Britain Tidy Blue Flag awarded beaches at East Beach, Shoebury Common, Three Shells and Westcliff Bay. A modern vertical lift links the base of the High Street with the seafront and the new pier entrance.

===Conservation areas and architecture===


Southend has various Conservation areas across the city, with the first being designated in 1968. Nationally Historic England have 124 recorded listed buildings within the city.

====Selection of interesting architecture====

The Royal Terrace (originally called the Terrace), built between 1791 and 1793, is one of the few examples of 18th century urban housing in Essex, and was called &quot;Exceptional&quot; in the 2007 architectural guide &quot;The Buildings of England&quot;. The Terrace has been Grade II listed since 1951. In 1973, the owners of the Royal Hotel at the end of the Terrace, put in planning permission to demolish the public house and replace it, which was rejected.

Southchurch Hall is a Grade I listed Medieval moated house located in Southchurch, built between c.1321 – 1364 with later extensions. In 1930 it was restored and presented to the people of Southend by the Dowsett Family. The Hall was listed in Simon Jenkins &quot;England&#x27;s Thousand Best Houses&quot;.

St Mary&#x27;s Church, Prittlewell is a Grade I listed church that has existed since Saxon times and is the oldest building in the city. Professor Stephen Rippon of the University of Exeter noted in a study &quot;&quot;stone buildings in this period were extremely rare, suggesting Prittlewell was a &quot;minister&quot; church of some importance&quot;&quot;, and the church was mentioned in the Domesday book.

Southend-on-Sea War Memorial is a Grade II* listed obelisk situated in Clifftown, Southend. The structure was completed in 1921 to designs by Sir Edwin Lutyens. Architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner praised the &quot;remarkably subtly proportioned&quot; base and pedestal of the memorial.

The White Hall is a Grade II listed former tennis club house in Clatterfield Gardens in the suburb of Westcliff-on-Sea. The building, along with its neighbouring house were designed by the Head of the School of Architecture at Southend Municipal College, Douglas Niel Martin-Kaye for the Thurston family. The building from 1934, is designed in the International Style and was to be part of a modernist development that failed to materialise beyond the two buildings. The building is now home to the Sunshine Nursery.

Porters is a medieval Manor house. The name comes from the family, le-Porters, who owned the land during the 14th century. The current house was built either in the 15th or 16th century made from red brick, with cross wings at the east and west ends gabled on the north and south fronts. At the end of the 16th century it was rebuilt with the space between the wings being filled in and a porch built on the north front. The property&#x27;s first recorded owner was Humfrey Browne (died 1592). Between 1833 to 1835, Benjamin Disraeli stayed at Porters on numerous occasions. In 1912, Sir Charles Nicholson purchased the building to save it from demolition, living there until 1932, when it was sold to Southend Corporation who in 1935 opened it as the Mayor&#x27;s parlour and civic house. The building was listed as Grade I in 1951.

===Art, galleries, museums and libraries===

Southend Museums, part of Southend on Sea City Council, operates two historic houses - Southchurch Hall and Prittlewell Priory, an art gallery - Beecroft Art Gallery, and the Southend Central Museum and Planetarium. The museums service looks after around 50,000 objects including collections of archaeology, natural history, social history, fashion and textile, fine art and photography. Southend Central Museum is the home of the world-renowned Prittlewell Princely Burial artefacts.

Independent museums and archives include The Jazz Centre UK, a jazz cultural centre, that has operated out of the Beecroft Art Gallery since 2016 and Southend Pier Museum, located on Southend Pier.

Focal Point Gallery, based in The Forum, is South Essex&#x27;s gallery for contemporary visual art, promoting and commissioning major solo exhibitions, group and thematic shows, a programme of events including performances, film screenings and talks, as well as offsite projects and temporary public artworks. The organisation is funded by Southend-on-Sea City Council and Arts Council England.

The Old Waterworks Arts Center operates on North Road, Westcliff in the former Victorian water works building. It holds art exhibitions, talks and workshops.

Metal, the art organisation set up by Jude Kelly OBE has been based in Chalkwell Hall since 2006. The organisation offers residency space for artists and also organises the Village Green Art &amp; Music Festival. The park is also home to NetPark, which claims to be the world&#x27;s first digital art park.

Southend has several small libraries located in Leigh, Westcliff, Kent Elms and Southchurch. The central library has moved from its traditional location on Victoria Avenue to The Forum in Elmer Approach, a new facility paid for by Southend Council, South Essex College and The University of Essex. It replaced the former Farringdon Multistorey Car Park. The old Central Library building (built 1974) has become home to the Beecroft Gallery and the Jazz Centre UK. This building had replaced the former Carnegie funded free library, that opened in 1906, and is now home to the Southend Central Museum.

===Theatres===
====Current venues====

There are a number of theatres in the city proving a variety of entertainment.

The Edwardian Palace Theatre is a Grade II listed building that opened in 1912. It shows plays by professional troupes and repertory groups, as well as comedy acts. The theatre has two circles and the steepest rake in Britain. The theatre was given to the town by its then owner Gertrude Mouillot in 1942 on condition that local amateur groups could continue to use the theatre. A smaller venue called The Dixon Studio was added in the early 1980s after a fundraising campaign by the Palace Theatre Trust led by John F Dixon.

The Cliffs Pavilion is the largest purpose built arts venue in Essex. Plans for a theatre, the Shorefield Pavilion, on the site started in 1935 when the borough council purchased the site to build a 500-seat theatre and concert venue, with work starting four years later on construction but was suspended by the outbreak of World War II. After the war, the site was known as Southend&#x27;s white elephant until 1963, when work was started on building that could host shows, concerts and private functions. The building was opened by the actor, writer and director Sir Bernard Miles in July 1964, with the first show opening the next day starring Norman Vaughan and his troupe of dancers, the Swinging Lovelies. In 1991–92, the council extended the site, with a new Foyer Bar added and a balcony added to the auditorium, increasing the capacity to 1,600. The venue hosts a variety of concerts, shows and performances on ice, as well as pantomimes at Christmas. Artists that have performed at the Cliffs include Paul McCartney and Oasis, whose live DVD Live by the Sea was recorded at the Cliffs.

The Clifftown Theatre is located in the former Clifftown United Reformed Church and as well as regular performances is part of the East 15 Acting School campus.

====Former venues====
Southend once hosted many more theatres. The New Empire Theatre closed in 2009. Unlike the Cliffs Pavilion or the Palace Theatre, the theatre was privately run, and hosted more amateur groups. The theatre was converted from the old ABC Cinema, which had previously been the Empire Theatre built in 1896. The theatre closed after a dispute between the trust that ran the theatre and its owners. The building was badly damaged by fire on Saturday 1 August 2015 and was demolished in 2017.

Other former venues included the Floral Hall on Western Esplanade, which hosted G. H. Chirgwin, that burnt down in 1937, while the Sundeck Theatre was at the pier head and hosted acts like Arthur English, until it closed and was converted to the Diamond Horseshoe Showbar before it was destroyed in the fire in 1976. The largest lost theatre was the Hippodrome in Southchurch Road, designed by Bertie Crewe, which opened in 1909. The theatre could hold 1,750 on three tiers, hosting acts like Harry Houdini, but was purchased by Gaumont Theatres and was converted to a cinema in 1933.

===Cinema and film===

Southend has one cinema – the Odeon Multiplex at Victoria Circus which has eight screens. The borough of Southend had at one time a total of 18 cinema theatres, with the most famous being the Odeon (formerly the Astoria Theatre), which as well as showing films hosted live entertainers including the Beatles and Laurel and Hardy. This building no longer stands having been replaced by the Southend Campus of the University of Essex. There are plans to build a new 10-screen cinema and entertainment facility on the site of the Seaway Car Park.

====On film====

Southend has appeared in films over the years, with the New York New York arcade on Marine Parade being used in the British gangster flick &quot;Essex Boys&quot;, the premiere of which took place at the Southend Odeon. Southend Airport was used for the filming of the James Bond film &quot;Goldfinger&quot;. Part of the 1989 black comedy film Killing Dad was set and filmed in Southend, while Stephen Poliakoff used several locations in the city to film his 1981 film Bloody Kids.

Southend and the surrounding areas were heavily used and featured in the Viral Marketing for the Universal Pictures 2022 American science fiction action film sequel &quot;Jurassic World Dominion&quot;, with a number of the featured videos on the DinoTracker website filmed in the Southend area doubling for locations around the world. This is due to the fact that local resident and Jurassic World Franchise marketer Samuel Phillips utilised the area for both videos and imagery.

Southend&#x27;s primary music venues are Chinnerys, formerly Ivy House, and the Cliffs Pavilion. Chinnerys is a 400-person capacity club which has hosted the likes of the Arctic Monkeys, The Charlatans and The Libertines.

<text>Art &amp; Language is an English conceptual artists&#x27; collaboration that has undergone many changes since it was created around 1967. The group was founded by artists who shared a common desire to combine intellectual ideas and concerns with the creation of art, and included many Americans.

From May 1969, the group published in England the magazine &quot;Art-Language: The Journal of Conceptual Art&quot;.

==History==

The Art &amp; Language group was founded around 1967 in the United Kingdom by Terry Atkinson (b. 1939), David Bainbridge (b. 1941), Michael Baldwin (b. 1945) and Harold Hurrell (b. 1940). The group was critical of what was considered mainstream modern art practices at the time. In their work conversations, they created gallery art and presented these ideas in a journal as part of their discussions.

The first issue of &quot;Art-Language: The Journal of Conceptual Art&quot; (Volume 1, Number 1) was published in May 1969.

In 1972, the group created &quot;Index 01&quot;, consisting of 350 texts placed inside 8 filing cabinets. These texts were &quot;indexed according to their logical and ideological (in)compatibility&quot;, to assert a &quot;critical inquiry into art practice as an art activity in itself&quot;. The Art &amp; Language group that exhibited in the international &quot;Documenta 5&quot; exhibitions of 1972 included Atkinson, Bainbridge, Baldwin, Hurrell, Pilkington, Rushton, and Joseph Kosuth, the American editor of &quot;Art-Language&quot;. The work consisted of a filing system of material published and circulated by Art &amp; Language members. π

==Projects==

Ian Burn and Mel Ramsden co-founded The Society for Theoretical Art and Analysis in New York in the late 1960s. They joined Art &amp; Language in 1970–71. During this time, Sarah Charlesworth and Christine Kozlov became affiliated with the group. New York Art &amp; Language became fragmented after 1975 because of disagreements concerning principles of collaboration.

In the early years of the 1970s, several artists joined the collective, including Ian Burn, Michael Corris, Charles Harrison, Preston Heller, Joseph Kosuth, Andrew Menard, Mel Ramsden and Terry Smith, and David Rushton. During this time the group produced numerous theoretical writings and art works.

During the mid-1970s the group was in conflict during a time when conceptual art had lost some of its &quot;critical bearing&quot; and was being institutionalized. The conflicts among the collective existed within the context of global socio-political turmoil and economic crisis as well as the &quot;revival of modernism.&quot;

By the end of the decade, the only members who remained were Baldwin, Harrison and Ramsden, with the occasional participation of Mayo Thompson and the group Red Krayola with whom several recordings were made. Ian Burn returned to Australia, joining Ian Milliss, a conceptual artist who had begun work with trade unions in the early 1970s, in becoming active in Union Media Services, a design studio for social and community initiatives and the development of trade unions.

In 1986, Art &amp; Language was nominated for the Turner Prize.
Art &amp; Language and the Jackson Pollock Bar collaborated for the first time in January 1995, during the &quot;Art &amp; Language &amp; Luhmann&quot; symposium, organized by the Contemporary Social Considerations Institute (Institut für soziale Gegenwartsfragen) of Freiburg. The 3-day symposium included speakers such as Catherine David, who prepared the Documenta X, and Peter Weibel, artist and curator. There was also a theoretical installation of an Art &amp; Language text produced in playback by the Jackson Pollock Bar. The installation was interpreted by five German actors playing the roles of Jack Tworkow, Philip Guston, Harold Rosenberg, Robert Motherwell and Ad Reinhardt.

An archive of papers relating to &quot;New York Art &amp; Language&quot; are held at the Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles.

==Critical reception==
In 1999, Art &amp; Language exhibited at PS1 MoMA in New York, with a major installation entitled &quot;The Artist Out of Work&quot;. This was a recollection of Art &amp; Language&#x27;s dialogical and other practices, curated by Michael Corris and Neil Powell. In a negative appraisal of the exhibition, art critic Jerry Saltz wrote, &quot;A quarter century ago, &#x27;Art &amp; Language&#x27; forged an important link in the genealogy of conceptual art, but next efforts have been so self-sufficient and obscure that their work is now virtually irrelevant.&quot;

In 2002, Beatriz Herráez, writing for Flash Art, described the Art &amp; Language retrospective exhibition, &quot;Too Dark to Read&quot;, as &quot;declaration meant to ‘clarify’ the group’s practice&quot; as a method that is located in &quot;the discursive quality of its ideational system and never in isolated works.&quot;

Adrian Searle wrote in 2014: &quot;Art &amp; Language is as much as anything a conversation from which work arises and goes off on its own tangent, referencing itself, dragging Art &amp; Language’s compendious history with it as it goes. Their&#x27;s is an art that makes and unmakes itself, eats and regurgitates itself.&quot;
