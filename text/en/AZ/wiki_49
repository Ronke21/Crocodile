<text>Aimee Elizabeth Semple McPherson (née Kennedy; October 9, 1890 – September 27, 1944), also known as Sister Aimee or Sister, was a Canadian-born Pentecostal evangelist and media celebrity in the 1920s and 1930s, famous for founding the Foursquare Church. McPherson pioneered the use of broadcast mass media for wider dissemination of both religious services and appeals for donations, using radio to draw in both audience and revenue with the growing appeal of popular entertainment and incorporating stage techniques into her weekly sermons at Angelus Temple, an early megachurch.

In her time, she was the most publicized Protestant evangelist, surpassing Billy Sunday and other predecessors. She conducted public faith healing demonstrations involving tens of thousands of participants. McPherson&#x27;s view of the United States as a nation founded and sustained by divine inspiration influenced later pastors.

National news coverage focused on events surrounding her family and church members, including accusations that she fabricated her reported kidnapping. McPherson&#x27;s preaching style, extensive charity work and ecumenical contributions were major influences on 20th-century Charismatic Christianity.

==Biography==

===Early life===
McPherson was born Aimee Elizabeth Kennedy in Salford, Ontario, Canada, to James Morgan and Mildred Ona (Pearce) Kennedy (1871–1947). She had early exposure to religion through her mother who worked with the poor in Salvation Army soup kitchens. As a child she would play &quot;Salvation Army&quot; with classmates and preach sermons to dolls.

As a teenager, McPherson strayed from her mother&#x27;s teachings by reading novels and attending movies and dances, activities disapproved by the Salvation Army and her father&#x27;s Methodist religion. In high school, she was taught the theory of evolution. She began to ask questions about faith and science but was unsatisfied with the answers. She wrote to a Canadian newspaper, questioning the taxpayer-funded teaching of evolution. This was her first exposure to fame, as people nationwide responded to her letter, and the beginning of a lifelong anti-evolution crusade.

=== Conversion, marriage, and family ===

While attending a revival meeting in 1907, McPherson met Robert James Semple, a Pentecostal missionary from Ireland. She dedicated her life to Jesus and converted to Pentecostalism. At the meeting, she became enraptured by Semple and his message. After a short courtship, they were married in an August 1908 Salvation Army ceremony. Semple supported them as a foundry worker and preached at the local Pentecostal mission. They studied the Bible together, then moved to Chicago and joined William Durham&#x27;s Full Gospel Assembly. Durham instructed her in the practice of interpretation of tongues.

After embarking on an evangelistic tour to China, both contracted malaria. Semple also contracted dysentery, of which he died in Hong Kong. McPherson recovered and gave birth to their daughter, Roberta Star Semple. Although McPherson claimed to have considered staying in China to continue Robert&#x27;s work, she returned to the United States after receiving the money for a return ticket from her mother.

After her recuperation in the United States, McPherson joined her mother Mildred working with the Salvation Army. While in New York City, she met accountant Harold Stewart McPherson. They were married in 1912, moved to Providence, Rhode Island, and had a son, Rolf Potter Kennedy McPherson. During this time, McPherson felt as though she denied her &quot;calling&quot; to go preach. Struggling with emotional distress and obsessive–compulsive disorder, she would weep and pray. In 1914, she fell seriously ill with appendicitis. McPherson later stated that after a failed operation, she heard a voice asking her to go preach. After accepting the voice&#x27;s challenge, she said, she was able to turn over in bed without pain. In 1915, her husband returned home and discovered that McPherson had left him and taken the children. A few weeks later, he received a note inviting him to join her in evangelistic work.

Harold McPherson followed her to bring her home but changed his mind after seeing her preaching. He joined her in evangelism, setting up tents for revival meetings and preaching. The couple sold their house and lived out of their &quot;gospel car&quot;. Despite his initial enthusiasm, Harold began leaving the crusade for long periods of time in the late 1910s. Initially attempting to launch his own career as a traveling evangelist, he eventually returned to Rhode Island and his secular job. The couple were divorced in 1921.

McPherson remarried in 1932 to actor and musician David Hutton. After she fell and fractured her skull, she visited Europe to recover. While there, she was angered to learn Hutton was billing himself as &quot;Aimee&#x27;s man&quot; in his cabaret singing act and was frequently photographed with scantily clad women. Hutton&#x27;s personal scandals were damaging the reputation of the Foursquare Church and its leader. McPherson and Hutton separated in 1933 and divorced in 1934. McPherson later publicly repented of the marriage for both theological and personal reasons and later rejected gospel singer Homer Rodeheaver when he proposed marriage in 1935.

===Ministry===
As part of Durham&#x27;s Full Gospel Assembly in Chicago, McPherson became known for interpreting tongues, translating the words of people speaking in tongues. Unable to find fulfillment as a housewife, in 1913 McPherson began evangelizing, holding tent revivals across the sawdust trail. McPherson quickly amassed a large following, often having to relocate to larger buildings to accommodate growing crowds. She emulated the enthusiasm of Pentecostal meetings but sought to avoid excesses, in which participants would shout, tremble on the floor, and speak in tongues. McPherson set up a separate tent area for such displays of religious fervor, which could be off-putting to larger audiences.

Of great influence to McPherson was Evangelist and Faith Healer Maria Woodworth-Etter. Etter had broken the glass ceiling for popular female preachers, drawing crowds of thousands, and her style influenced the Pentecostal Movement. The two had met in person on several occasions prior to Etter&#x27;s death in 1924.

In 1916, McPherson embarked on a tour of the southern United States, and again in 1918 with Mildred Kennedy. Standing on the back seat of their convertible, McPherson preached sermons over a megaphone. In 1917, she started a magazine, &quot;Bridal Call&quot;, for which she wrote articles about women&#x27;s roles in religion; she portrayed the link between Christians and Jesus as a marriage bond. Along with taking women&#x27;s roles seriously, the magazine contributed to transforming Pentecostalism into an ongoing American religious presence.

In Baltimore in 1919 she was first &quot;discovered&quot; by newspapers after conducting evangelistic services at the Lyric Opera House, where she performed faith-healing demonstrations. During these events the crowds in their religious ecstasy were barely kept under control. Baltimore became a pivotal point for her early career.

She was ordained as an evangelist by the Assemblies of God USA in 1919. However, she ended her association with the Assemblies of God in 1922.

=== Career in Los Angeles ===
In 1918, both McPherson and her daughter Roberta contracted Spanish influenza. While McPherson&#x27;s case was not serious, Roberta was near death. According to McPherson, while praying over her daughter she experienced a vision in which God told her he would give her a home in California. In October 1918 McPherson and her family drove from New York to Los Angeles over two months, with McPherson preaching revivals along the way. McPherson&#x27;s first revival in Los Angeles was held at Victoria Hall, a 1,000-seat auditorium downtown. She soon reached capacity there and had to relocate to the 3,500 capacity Temple Auditorium on Pershing Square, where people waited for hours to enter the crowded venue. Afterwards, attendees of her meetings built a home for her family. At this time, Los Angeles was a popular vacation destination. Rather than touring the United States, McPherson chose to stay in Los Angeles, drawing audiences from both tourists and the city&#x27;s burgeoning population.

For several years, she traveled and raised money for the construction of a large, domed church in Echo Park, named Angelus Temple, in reference to the Angelus bells and to angels. Not wanting to incur debt, McPherson found a construction firm willing to work with her as funds were raised &quot;by faith&quot;, beginning with $5,000 for the foundation. McPherson mobilized diverse groups to fund and build the church, by means such as selling chairs for Temple seating. In his book &#x27;Growing up in Hollywood&#x27; Robert Parrish describes in detail attending one of her services.

Raising more money than expected, McPherson altered the plans and built a &quot;megachurch&quot;. The endeavor cost contributors around $250,000. Costs were kept down by donations of building materials and labor. The dedication took place in January 1923. Enrollment grew to over 10,000, and Angelus Temple was advertised as the largest single Christian congregation in the world. According to church records, the Temple received 40 million visitors within the first seven years.

===Charitable work===

McPherson developed a church organization to provide for physical as well as spiritual needs. McPherson mobilized people to get involved in charity and social work, saying that &quot;true Christianity is not only to be good but to do good.&quot; The Temple collected donations for humanitarian relief including for a Japanese disaster and a German relief fund. Men released from prison were found jobs by a &quot;brotherhood&quot;. A &quot;sisterhood&quot; sewed baby clothing for impoverished mothers.

In June 1925, after an earthquake in Santa Barbara McPherson interrupted a radio broadcast to request food, blankets, clothing, and emergency supplies. In 1928, after a dam failed and the ensuing flood left up to 600 dead, McPherson&#x27;s church led the relief effort. In 1933, an earthquake struck and devastated Long Beach. McPherson quickly arranged for volunteers offering blankets, coffee, and doughnuts. McPherson persuaded fire and police departments to assist in distribution. Doctors, physicians, and dentists staffed her free clinic that trained nurses to treat children and the elderly. To prevent disruption of electricity service to homes of overdue accounts during the winter, a cash reserve was set up with the utility company.
Drawing from her childhood experience with the Salvation Army, in 1927 McPherson opened a commissary at Angelus Temple offering food, clothing, and blankets. She became active in creating soup kitchens, free clinics, and other charitable activities during the Great Depression, feeding an estimated 1.5 million. Volunteer workers filled commissary baskets with food and other items, as well as Foursquare Gospel literature. When the government shut down the free school-lunch program, McPherson took it over. Her giving &quot;alleviated suffering on an epic scale&quot;. 

As McPherson refused to distinguish between the &quot;deserving&quot; and the &quot;undeserving,&quot; her commissary became known as an effective and inclusive aid institution, assisting more families than other public or private institutions. Because her programs aided nonresidents such as migrants from other states and Mexico, she ran afoul of California state regulations. Though temple guidelines were later officially adjusted to accommodate those policies, helping families in need was a priority, regardless of their place of residence.

==Ministry==

=== Style of ministry ===
In August 1925, McPherson chartered a plane to Los Angeles to give her Sunday sermon. Aware of the opportunity for publicity, she arranged for followers and press at the airport. The plane failed after takeoff and the landing gear collapsed, sending the nose of the plane into the ground. McPherson used the experience as the narrative of an illustrated sermon called &quot;The Heavenly Airplane&quot;, featuring the devil as pilot, sin as the engine, and temptation as propeller.

On another occasion, she described being pulled over by a police officer, calling the sermon &quot;Arrested for Speeding&quot;. Dressed in a traffic cop&#x27;s uniform, she sat in a police motorcycle and blared the siren. One author in attendance wrote that she drove the motorcycle across the access ramp to the pulpit, slammed the brakes, and raised a hand to shout &quot;Stop! You&#x27;re speeding to Hell!&quot;

McPherson employed a small group of artists, electricians, decorators, and carpenters, who built sets for each service. Religious music was played by an orchestra. McPherson also worked on elaborate sacred operas. One production, &quot;The Iron Furnace&quot;, based on the Exodus story, saw Hollywood actors assist with obtaining costumes.
Though McPherson condemned theater and film as the devil&#x27;s workshop, its techniques were co-opted. She became the first woman evangelist to adopt cinematic methods to avoid dreary church services. Serious messages were delivered in a humorous tone. Animals were frequently incorporated. McPherson gave up to 22 sermons a week, including lavish Sunday night services so large that extra trolleys and police were needed to help route the traffic through Echo Park. To finance the Temple and its projects, collections were taken at every meeting.

McPherson preached a conservative gospel but used progressive methods, taking advantage of radio, movies, and stage acts. She attracted some women associated with modernism, but others were put off by the contrast between her message and her presentation.
The battle between fundamentalists and modernists escalated after World War I. Fundamentalists generally believed their faith should influence every aspect of their lives. Despite her modern style, McPherson aligned with the fundamentalists in seeking to eradicate modernism and secularism in homes, churches, schools, and communities.

The appeal of McPherson&#x27;s revival events from 1919 to 1922 surpassed any touring event of theater or politics in American history. She broke attendance records recently set by Billy Sunday and frequently used his temporary tabernacle structures to hold her roving revival meetings. One such event was held in a boxing ring, and throughout the boxing event, she carried a sign reading &quot;knock out the Devil&quot;. In San Diego the city called in a detachment of Marines to help police control a revival crowd of over 30,000 people.

== Faith healing ministry ==

McPherson&#x27;s ability to draw crowds was greatly assisted by her faith healing presentations. According to Nancy Barr Mavity, an early McPherson biographer, the evangelist claimed that when she laid hands on sick or injured persons, they got well because of the power of God in her. During a 1916 revival in New York, a woman in advanced stages of rheumatoid arthritis was brought to the altar by friends. McPherson laid hands on her and prayed, and the woman apparently walked out of the church without crutches. McPherson&#x27;s reputation as a faith healer grew as people came to her by the tens of thousands. McPherson&#x27;s faith-healing practices were extensively covered in the news and were a large part of her early-career success. Over time, though, she largely withdrew from faith-healing, but still scheduled weekly and monthly healing sessions which remained popular until her death.

In 1919, Harold left her as he did not enjoy the travelling lifestyle. Her mother then joined her and the children on tour. She began her faith-healing work the same year.

McPherson said she experienced several of her own personal faith healing incidents. One occurred in 1909, when her broken foot was mended, an event that served to introduce her to the possibilities of the healing power of faith. Another was an unexpected recovery from an operation in 1914, where hospital staff expected her to die. In 1916, before a gathered revival tent crowd, Aimee experienced swift rejuvenation of blistered skin from a serious flash burn caused by a lamp that had exploded in her face.

McPherson&#x27;s first reported successful public faith healing session of another person was in Corona, New York, on Long Island, in 1916. A young woman in the advanced stages of rheumatoid arthritis was brought to the altar by friends just as McPherson preached &quot;Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever&quot;. McPherson laid her hands upon the woman&#x27;s head, and the woman was able to leave the church that night without crutches. According to Mildred Kennedy the crowds at the revivals were easily twice as large as McPherson reported in her letters and the healings were not optimistic exaggerations. Kennedy said she witnessed visible cancers disappear, the deaf hear, the blind see, and the disabled walk.

=== Spreckels Organ Pavilion (1921) ===
In late January 1921 McPherson conducted a healing ceremony at the Spreckels Organ Pavilion in Balboa Park in San Diego, California. Police, U.S. Marines, and Army personnel helped manage traffic and the estimated 30,000 people who attended. She had to move to the outdoor site after the audience grew too large for the 3,000-seat Dreamland Boxing Arena.

During the engagement, a woman paralyzed from the waist down from was presented for faith healing. McPherson feared she would be run out of town if this healing did not manifest, due to previous demonstrations that had occurred at smaller events of hers. McPherson prayed and laid hands on her, and the woman got up out of her wheelchair and walked. Other unwell persons came to the platform McPherson occupied, though not all were cured.

Due to the demand for her services, her stay was extended. McPherson prayed for hours without food or stopping for a break. At the end of the day, she was taken away by her staff, dehydrated and unsteady with fatigue. McPherson wrote of the day, &quot;As soon as one was healed, she ran and told nine others, and brought them too, even telegraphing and rushing the sick on trains&quot;. Originally planned for two weeks in the evenings, McPherson&#x27;s Balboa Park revival meetings lasted over five weeks and went from dawn until dusk.

=== 1921–1922 ===
At a revival meeting in August 1921, in San Francisco, journalists posing as scientific investigators diverted healing claimants as they descended from the platform and &quot;cross-examined as to the genuineness of the cure.&quot; Concurrently, a group of doctors from the American Medical Association in San Francisco secretly investigated some of McPherson&#x27;s local revival meetings. The subsequent AMA report stated McPherson&#x27;s healing was &quot;genuine, beneficial and wonderful&quot;. This also was the tone of press clippings, testimonials, and private correspondence in regards to the healings.

In 1921 during the Denver campaign, a Serbian Romani tribe chief, Dewy Mark and his mother stated they were faith-healed by McPherson of a respiratory illness and a &quot;fibroid tumor.&quot; For the next year the Romani king, by letter and telegram urged all other Romani to follow McPherson and &quot;her wonderful Lord Jesus.&quot; Thousands of others from the Mark and Mitchell tribes came to her in caravans from all over the country and were converted with healings being reported from a number of them. Funds in gold, taken from necklaces, other jewelry, and elsewhere, were given by Romani in gratitude and helped fund the construction of the new Angelus Temple. Hundreds of people regularly attended services at the newly built Angeles Temple in Los Angeles. Many Romani followed her to a revival gathering in Wichita, Kansas, and on May 29, 1922, heavy thunderstorms threatened to rain out the thousands who gathered there. McPherson interrupted the speaker, raised her hand to the sky, and prayed, &quot;if the land hath need of it, let it fall (the rain) after the message has been delivered to these hungry souls&quot;. To the crowd&#x27;s surprise, the rain immediately stopped and many believed they witnessed a miracle. The event was reported the following day by the &quot;Wichita Eagle.&quot; For the gathered Romani, it was a further acknowledgement &quot;of the woman&#x27;s power&quot;. Up until that time, the Romani in the US were largely unreached by Christianity. The infusion of crosses and other symbols of Christianity alongside Romani astrology charts and crystal balls was the result of McPherson&#x27;s influence.

In 1922, McPherson returned for a second tour in the Great Revival of Denver and asked about people who have stated healings from the previous visit. Seventeen people, some well-known members of the community, testified, giving credence to the audience of her belief that &quot;healing still occurred among modern Christians&quot;.

In 1928, when two clergymen were preaching against her and her &quot;divine healing,&quot; McPherson&#x27;s staff assembled thousands of documents and attached to each of them photos, medical certificates, X-rays and testimonies of healing. The information gathered was used to silence the clergymens&#x27; accusations and was also later accessed by some McPherson biographers.

In later years, McPherson identified other individuals with a faith healing gift. During regular healing sessions she worked among them but over time she mostly withdrew from the faith healing aspect of her services, as she found that it was overwhelming other areas of her ministry.

Scheduled healing sessions nevertheless remained highly popular with the public until her death in 1944. One of these was Stretcher Day, which was held behind the Angeles Temple parsonage once every five or six weeks. This was for the most serious of the infirm who could only be moved by &quot;stretcher.&quot; Ambulances would arrive at the parsonage and McPherson would enter, greet the patient and pray over them. On Stretcher Day, so many ambulances were in demand that Los Angeles area hospitals and medical centers had to make it a point of reserving a few for other needs and emergencies.

=== McPherson&#x27;s faith healing in the media ===
McPherson&#x27;s faith-healing demonstrations were extensively covered in the news media and were a large part of her early career legacy. James Robinson, an author on Pentecostalism, diverse healing and holiness traditions, writes: &quot;In terms of results, the healings associated with her were among the most impressive in late modern history.&quot;.

In April 1920, a &quot;Washington Times&quot; reporter conveyed that for McPherson&#x27;s work to be a hoax on such a grand scale was inconceivable, communicating that the healings were occurring more rapidly than he could record them. To help verify the testimonies, as per his editor, the reporter took names and addresses of those he saw and with whom he spoke. Documentation, including news articles, letters, and testimonials indicated sick people came to her by the tens of thousands. According to these sources, some healings were only temporary, while others lasted throughout people&#x27;s lives.

In 1921 a survey was sent out by First Baptist Church Pastor William Keeney Towner in San Jose, California, to 3,300 people to investigate McPherson&#x27;s healing services. 2500 persons responded and 6% indicated they were immediately and completely healed while 85% indicated they were partially healed and continued to improve ever since. Fewer than 0.5% did not feel they were at least spiritually uplifted and had their faith strengthened.

&quot;Denver Post&quot; reporter Frances Wayne wrote that while McPherson&#x27;s &quot;attack&quot; on sin was &quot;uncultured...the deaf heard, the blind saw, the paralytic walked, the palsied became calm, before the eyes of as many people that could be packed into the largest church auditorium in Denver&quot;.

After McPherson&#x27;s death, LIFE Magazine wrote that, &quot;her vast popularity in derived in part from the skill with which she applied theatrical techniques to the art of homiletics&quot;.

===Views on McPherson&#x27;s work===
In 1921, some members of Lodi California&#x27;s First Congregational Church attended McPherson&#x27;s tent revival meeting in San Jose California and returned speaking enthusiastically of healings and conversions. Their Oxford-educated Pastor Charles S. Price (1887–1947), believed what they underwent was &quot;metaphysical, psychological, nothing tangible,&quot; and &quot;they had been inoculated with a strange serum, had &quot;gotten the hallelujahs.&quot; He went to San Jose to learn how to &quot;straighten them out.&quot; Price was eventually persuaded by McPherson who &quot;won more people to Jesus Christ in one afternoon&quot; than he could recall in fourteen years of ministry. He became her assistant and starting in 1922 went on to preach as a traveling evangelist who converted tens of thousands along with many instances of miraculous divine healings that were stated to have occurred.

Although he was an agnostic, Charles Chaplin discreetly enjoyed listening to McPherson&#x27;s Sunday night illustrated sermons. He was astounded by the healings he saw in her services. He thought they might have been a combination of McPherson&#x27;s skilled hypnotism and the power she commanded over the crowds.

In October 1921, crowds filled the auditorium at Canton, Ohio, and many people who were carried to the platform for prayer walked away unassisted. Crutches and braces were left behind while the blind stated they could see and the deaf could hear. Though six local ministers concurred that the work was a &quot;genuine manifestation of God to fulfill his promises,&quot; three others did not commit and P.H. Welshimer of First Christian Church, a congregation of 6,000 members, stated the healings were the result of hypnotism and &quot;mesmeric power.&quot;. According to a church publication, psychologist and hypnotist, Professor D. H. Deamude, who was in town during the campaign, stated that, based on his expertise, whatever McPherson was doing, hypnotism could not account for it.

Actor Anthony Quinn, who for a time played in the church&#x27;s band and was an apprentice preacher, in this partial quote, recalls a service:

Biographer Daniel Mark Epstein wrote that described incidents of miraculous faith healing are sometimes clinically explained as a result of hysteria or a form of hypnosis. Strong emotions and the mind&#x27;s ability to trigger the production of opiates, endorphins, and enkephalins have also been offered as explanations, as well as the suggestion that the healings were simply faked. In an interview with the Baltimore Sun, Epstein said:

Years later, Epstein interviewed Rolf McPherson, his mother&#x27;s appointed successor who spoke of the period: &quot;more patients were open to the possibilities of faith healing.&quot; Next to him, mounted on his office wall, was a hand-tinted photo enlargement of his mother helping a woman out her wheelchair in Balboa Park. He speculated that healings occurred because people had more faith in God and less in science, and he could not &quot;imagine this sort of thing happening again.&quot;

===Personal and religious views===
When McPherson retired after a long and exhausting faith healing service, she would sometimes suffer from insomnia, a problem she would contend with for the rest of her life.

She did not abstain from visiting doctors or using medicine to treat her own illnesses.

When traveling abroad, she paid scrupulous attention to sanitation, concerned that a careless oversight might result in acquiring an exotic disease.

When asked by a journalist about her demonstrations, McPherson said, &quot;the saving of souls is the most important part of my ministry.&quot;.

McPherson considered each faith healing incident a sacred gift from God, the glory of Jesus Christ, passed through her to persons healed and not to be taken for granted.

Divine healing, in her view, was a church sacrament rather than entertainment. In her own writings and sermons, McPherson did not referred to divine healing as being accessible by faith and devotion. She disliked being given credit for the healings, considering herself the medium through which the power flowed, with the power of Christ working the cure.

==Foursquare Church==
McPherson published the weekly &quot;Foursquare Crusader.&quot; She began broadcasting on radio in the early 1920s. In April 1922, she became the first woman to preach a sermon wirelessly. With the opening of Foursquare Gospel-owned KFSG in 1924, she became the second woman granted a broadcast license by the Department of Commerce, which supervised broadcasting at the time.

In October 1922, she explained her vision of &quot;Foursquare Gospel&quot; (or &quot;Full Gospel&quot;) in a sermon in Oakland, California. This represents the four aspects of the ministry of Jesus Christ: Savior, Baptizer with the Holy Ghost, Healer and King.

McPherson racially integrated her tent meetings and church services. On one occasion in 1924, as a response to integration, hundreds of Ku Klux Klan members were in attendance. McPherson told them a parable about Jesus appearing to a Black man and telling him, he, too, had been refused admittance to an all white church, and allegedly stared at them until they exited the temple. They returned without their hoods and robes, and after the service they were found on the ground nearby. Though she did maintain some level of support for white supremacists and KKK members, sharing the pulpit at Angelus Temple with some. She is also credited with helping Hispanic ministries in Los Angeles.

McPherson caused concern among some Los Angeles churches. Though she shared many of their fundamentalist beliefs, her lavish sermons and faith-healing events, along with her status as a female divorcee, were unprecedented, and her style of dress was drawing emulators. Her illustrated sermons attracted criticism from some clergy members for allegedly turning the Gospel message into mundane entertainment. Faith healing was considered to be unique to Apostolic times. Rival radio evangelist Robert P. Shuler published a pamphlet titled &quot;McPhersonism,&quot; in which he called her ministry &quot;out of harmony with God&#x27;s word.&quot; Debates such as the Bogard-McPherson debate in 1934 drew further attention to the controversy.

The newly forming Assemblies of God denomination worked with her for a time, but it encouraged her to separate her church from established Protestant faiths. McPherson resisted trends to isolate her church as a denomination and continued her evangelical coalition-building. She was helped by the establishment of L.I.F.E. Bible College adjacent to the Temple, which was intended to train ministers so they would be able to share her new &quot;Foursquare Gospel&quot; both nationally and internationally. Methodist minister Frank Thompson ran the college, teaching students the doctrines of John Wesley, while McPherson and others infused them with Pentecostal ideals. McPherson&#x27;s efforts eventually led Pentecostals, who were previously on the periphery of Christianity, into mainstream American evangelicalism.

==Life in the media spotlight==
By early 1926, McPherson had become one of the most charismatic and influential women and ministers of her time. Her fame equaled, to name a few, Charles Lindbergh, Johnny Weissmuller, Jack Dempsey, Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Knute Rockne, Bobby Jones, Louise Brooks, and Rudolph Valentino. She was a major American phenomenon, who along with some other high-profile preachers of the time, unlike Hollywood celebrities, could be admired by their adoring public, &quot;without apparently compromising their souls.&quot;
McPherson crusaded against Darwinian evolution and became a supporter of William Jennings Bryan during the 1925 Scopes trial, about local laws prohibiting the teaching of human evolution. Bryan and McPherson worked together in the Temple, and they believed that Darwinism undermined morality, &quot;poisoning the minds of the children of the nation.&quot; McPherson organized an all-night prayer service, preceded by a Bible parade through Los Angeles.

McPherson&#x27;s political alignment was undisclosed. She endorsed Herbert Hoover but threw her support behind Franklin D. Roosevelt and his social programs after his election. She patronized organized labor, preaching that a gangster&#x27;s money was &quot;no more unclean than the dollars of the man who amasses his millions from underpaid factory workers&quot;. She was more cautious when labor strikes resulted in violent uprisings, and worried about communism&#x27;s influence in labor unions. McPherson opposed both communism and fascism as totalitarian rule; communism ruling without God and fascism wrongly stating to represent the power of God.

McPherson did not align herself consistently with any broad conservative or liberal political agenda. Instead, she wanted Christianity to occupy a central place in national life. The Foursquare Gospel Church currently qualifies the evangelist&#x27;s views &quot;in light of the political and religious climate of the 1920s, 30s, and 40s,&quot; drawing a contrast between her approach and &quot;today&#x27;s extreme fundamentalist, right-wing Christianity.&quot; She was also among the first prominent Christian ministers to defend the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine.

==Reported kidnapping==
The reported kidnapping of Aimee Semple McPherson caused a media frenzy and changed her life and career. On May 18, 1926, McPherson disappeared from Ocean Park Beach in Santa Monica, California. Presuming she had drowned, searchers combed the area. McPherson sightings were reported around the county, often many miles apart. The Temple received calls and letters claiming knowledge of McPherson, including ransom demands.

After weeks of unpromising leads, Mildred Kennedy believed her daughter to be dead. After the Temple&#x27;s memorial service on June 23, Kennedy received a phone call from Douglas, Arizona. McPherson was alive in a Douglas hospital and relating her story to officials.

McPherson said that at the beach, she had been approached by a couple who wanted her to pray over their sick child. After walking with them to their car, she was shoved inside. A cloth laced with chloroform was held against her face, causing her to pass out. Eventually, she was moved to a shack in the Mexican desert. When her captors were away, McPherson escaped out a window and traveled through the desert for 11–17 hours and an estimated 17–20 miles (27–32 km), reaching Agua Prieta, Sonora, a Mexican border town, at around 1:00 a.m. Collapsing near a house, the evangelist was taken by locals to adjacent Douglas.

Her return to Los Angeles was greeted by 30,000–50,000 people, a greater turnout than President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s 1919 visit to Los Angeles.

===Grand jury inquiries===
Los Angeles prosecutors had varying theories why she disappeared, among them a publicity stunt, and finally contended that McPherson ran off with a former employee, Kenneth Ormiston, staying with him in a California resort town cottage he had rented. After leaving the cottage at the end of May, the pair traveled for the next three weeks and remained hidden. Around June 22, Ormiston drove McPherson to Mexico, dropping her off 3 miles outside of nearby Agua Prieta, where she walked the remaining distance. In contrast, McPherson consistently maintained her kidnapping story, and defense witnesses corroborated her assertions.

Much of the evidence asserted against McPherson came from reporters, who passed it on to police. The bulk of the investigation against McPherson was funded by Los Angeles-area newspapers at an estimated amount of $500,000. The secrecy of California&#x27;s grand jury proceedings was ignored by both sides as the Los Angeles prosecution passed new developments to the press, while the evangelist used her radio station to broadcast her side of the story.

===Case dismissal and aftermath===
On November 3, the case was to be moved to a jury trial set for January 1927, charging McPherson, her mother, and other defendants with criminal conspiracy, perjury, and obstruction of justice. If convicted, McPherson faced a maximum prison time of 42 years. However, the prosecution&#x27;s case developed credibility issues. Witnesses changed testimonies, and evidence often appeared to have suspicious origins or was mishandled and lost in custody. On January 2, Ormiston identified another woman as the companion who stayed with him at the cottage. All charges against McPherson and associated parties were dropped for lack of evidence on January 10. However, months of unfavorable news reports produced enduring public belief in McPherson&#x27;s wrongdoing.

==Claims of extramarital affairs==

Allegations of love affairs directed against McPherson started during the 1926 kidnapping trial. Suspected lovers generally denied involvement. Alarmed by her style of dress and involvement with Hollywood, a Temple official hired detectives in 1929 to shadow McPherson. The detectives found no evidence of affairs. After McPherson&#x27;s death, unsubstantiated allegations of affairs continued to emerge. Canadian journalist Gordon Sinclair claimed a 1934 affair in his autobiography. Another claim by comedian Milton Berle alleged a brief affair with the evangelist. Berle asserted that he met McPherson in Los Angeles where both were doing a charity show. Another book by Berle published during McPherson&#x27;s life did not claim an affair. Biographer Matthew Sutton asserted that Berle&#x27;s story of a crucifix in McPherson&#x27;s bedroom was inconsistent with the frigidity of Pentecostal-Catholic relations during that era. Other contradictions in Milton Berle&#x27;s story were noted as well. During that period, the evangelist&#x27;s appearances and whereabouts could be traced almost every day from publications and church and travel records, and there was no record of the charity show Berle alleged; McPherson also had her own charities. Moreover, she was incapacitated with illness for five full months of that year. By 1931, McPherson kept herself chaperoned to guard against allegations.

== Later life and career ==

===Cinema===
After the kidnapping, McPherson remained nationally famous and continued her ministry, but she fell out of favor with the press. The media, which once dubbed her a &quot;miracle worker&quot;, focused on disturbances in her household, including difficulties with her mother. Despite this, up to 10% of the population in Los Angeles held Temple membership, and movie studios competed to offer her contracts. Believing that film had the potential to transform Christianity, McPherson explored Hollywood culture and appeared in newsreels alongside Mary Pickford, Frances Perkins, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. She lost weight, cut and dyed her hair, began to wear makeup and jewelry, and became known for her stylish dress. This solicitation of fame was off-putting to some church members who preferred her former uniform of a navy cape over a white servant&#x27;s dress.

In 1927, McPherson set out on a tour, taking advantage of the publicity from her kidnapping story to preach. She even visited nightclubs, including Texas Guinan&#x27;s speakeasy, where she addressed the crowd. Her visits to bars added to McPherson&#x27;s notoriety: newspapers reported heavily on them, and rumors erroneously implied she was drinking, smoking, and dancing.

===Problems with Mildred Kennedy===
Mildred Kennedy did not agree with McPherson&#x27;s strategy of tearing down barriers between the secular and religious. In 1927, Kennedy left the Temple, along with other church members including 300 members of the choir. Attempting to curtail her daughter&#x27;s influence, Kennedy initiated a staff-member confidence vote against McPherson but lost. The two had argued over management and McPherson&#x27;s changing dress and appearance. Kennedy&#x27;s administrative skills had been crucial to growing McPherson&#x27;s ministry and maintaining Temple activities. A series of management staff replaced Kennedy, and the Temple became involved in various unsuccessful projects such as hotel building, cemetery plots, and land sales, plummeting into debt. In response to the difficulties, Kennedy returned in 1929, but because of continued disagreements with McPherson, resigned again in July 1930. The following month, McPherson had a physical and nervous breakdown. For 10 months, she was absent from the pulpit, diagnosed with acute acidosis.

===Resurrecting her career===
When she returned, she introduced her &quot;Attar of Roses&quot; sermon, based on the Song of Solomon. In October 1931 McPherson held a revival in Boston, a city with large Unitarian, Episcopalian, and Catholic populations, traditionally hostile to Pentecostal messages. On opening night, McPherson spoke to fewer than 5,000 in the 22,000-seat sports arena. The following day, her campaign&#x27;s tone shifted and attendance climbed sharply. The final day of afternoon and evening services saw 40,000 people attending, exceeding the stadium venue&#x27;s capacity and breaking attendance records.

McPherson&#x27;s revival in New York City was less fruitful because of her sensationalistic reputation. McPherson went on to Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia and visited 21 states. A full crew of musicians, scene designers, and costumers accompanied McPherson. Her last national revival tour of 1933-1934 claimed two million persons heard 336 sermons.

The &quot;Boston Evening Traveller&quot; newspaper reported:

McPherson was not a radical literalist. She believed that the creation story in the Book of Genesis allowed great latitude of interpretation, and she did not insist on Young Earth creationism. In a meeting with students, McPherson heard an assertion that Christianity had outlived its usefulness. The encounter persuaded her to travel and gain new perspectives. In 1935, McPherson embarked on a six-month world tour, partly to study the women&#x27;s movement in connection with India&#x27;s independence struggle and to speak with Mahatma Gandhi, who gave her a sari made on his spinning wheel. Impressed with Gandhi, McPherson thought that he might secretly lean toward Christianity. Other highlights included visiting Shwedagon Pagoda in Myanmar, hearing Benito Mussolini speak in Italy, and sitting on a wrecked military vehicle on a still-uncleared battlefield in Verdun, France.

In mid-1936, a delegation associated with the 1906 Azusa Street Revival, including African-American evangelist Emma Cotton, asked to use the Angelus Temple for their 30th anniversary celebration. Cotton and McPherson organized a series of meetings, also marking McPherson&#x27;s re-identification with Pentecostalism. McPherson&#x27;s experiments with celebrity had been less successful than she hoped, and alliances with other church groups were failing or defunct. Therefore, she looked to her spiritual origins and considered reintroducing Pentecostal elements into her public meetings. Temple officials were concerned that the Azusa people might bring &quot;wildfire and Holy Rollerism.&quot; 

Out of the Azusa Street Revival, African-American leaders and other minorities appeared on her pulpit, including African-American founder of the Churches of God in Christ Charles Harrison Mason, a significant Pentecostal leader. McPherson recommitted herself to the dissemination of &quot;classic Pentecostalism&quot;, expressing concern that the Foursquare approach was in danger of becoming too &quot;churchy&quot;. For the first time since the Temple opened, McPherson began to publicly speak in tongues.

===Problems with the Temple===
McPherson reassigned staff in an effort to address the Temple&#x27;s financial difficulties. This worsened tensions among staff members. Rumors circulated that charismatic evangelist Rheba Crawford Splivalo, who had been working with McPherson for years, planned to take the Temple from her. McPherson asked Splivalo to &quot;leave town&quot;. In the course of the staff controversy, McPherson&#x27;s lawyer issued a strongly worded press release that upset Roberta Star Semple, McPherson&#x27;s daughter, and led her to initiate a $150,000 slander lawsuit against him. Splivalo also sued McPherson for $1,080,000 because of alleged statements calling her a Jezebel and a Judas.

The two lawsuits filed by Semple and Splivalo were unrelated, but McPherson saw both as part of the Temple takeover plot. McPherson&#x27;s mother sided with Roberta Semple, making unflattering statements about McPherson to the press. McPherson&#x27;s defense in a public trial was dramatic and theatrical; she testified tearfully about how her daughter conspired against her. Her daughter&#x27;s lawyer, meanwhile, mocked McPherson by imitating her mannerisms. The trial estranged McPherson from her daughter. The judge ruled for Semple, giving a $2,000 judgment in her favor, and she later relocated to New York. Splivalo and the Temple settled their suit out of court for the &quot;cause of religion and the good of the community.&quot;

With Kennedy, Semple, and Splivalo gone, the Temple lost much of its leadership. However, McPherson found a new administrator in Giles Knight, who brought the Temple out of debt, disposed of 40 or so lawsuits, and eliminated spurious projects. He sequestered McPherson, allowed her to receive only a few personal visitors, and regulated her activities outside the Temple. This period was one of unprecedented creativity for McPherson: no longer distracted by reporters and lawsuits, she developed her illustrative sermon style. The irreligious Charlie Chaplin secretly attended her services, and she later consulted with Chaplin on ways to improve her presentations. McPherson&#x27;s public image improved and previous critics praised her work. Robert P. Shuler, who had previously attacked McPherson, proclaimed that &quot;Aimee&#x27;s missionary work was the envy of Methodists&quot;. He also expressed his support of her Foursquare Church&#x27;s 1943 application for admittance into the National Association of Evangelicals for United Action.

Her efforts toward interracial revival continued as she welcomed African-American people into the congregation and pulpit. While race riots burned Detroit in 1943, McPherson publicly converted former African-American heavyweight champion Jack Johnson on the Temple stage and embraced him.

==War years==
In the 1930s McPherson and the Foursquare Church explored pacifism, a component of Pentecostalism. McPherson also considered Gandhi&#x27;s views on pacifism, and Clinton Howard, chairman of the World Peace Commission, was invited to speak at the Temple. In 1932, she promoted disarmament. Foursquare leaders, alarmed at rapid changes in military technology, drew up an amendment inclusive of varied opinions on military service. Two views were held acceptable: the idea that one could bear arms in a righteous cause; and the view that killing of others, even in connection to military service, would endanger their souls. McPherson monitored international events leading up to the Second World War, believing that the apocalypse and the Second Coming of Christ were at hand.

All-night prayer meetings were held at the Temple starting in 1940 as Germany occupied Europe. She asked other Foursquare churches around the country to follow suit. She sent President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s secretary, Stephen Early, an outline of her plans, and various officials expressed appreciation, including the governor of California.

At the outbreak of World War II, McPherson rejected the Christian pacifism popular in the Pentecostal movement, saying that, &quot;It is the Bible against &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. It is the cross against the swastika. It is God against the antichrist of Japan...This is no time for pacifism.&quot; The Temple became a symbol of homefront sacrifice for the war effort. Its white dome was painted black and its stained-glass windows covered in anticipation of air raids. To advertise the need to conserve gasoline and rubber, McPherson drove a horse and buggy to the Temple.

Rubber and other drives were organized, and unlimited airtime on her radio station was given to the Office of War Information. She asked listeners to donate two hours each day for such tasks as rolling bandages. Money was raised to provide military bases with comfortable furnishings and radios. &quot;Newsweek&quot; published an article about McPherson, &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Living Minister&quot; in 1943, noting that she had collected 2,800 pints of blood for the Red Cross; servicemen in her audience were honored, and she would read the National Anthem during services. McPherson gave visiting servicemen autographed Bibles. She wrote:

She insulted Adolf Hitler and Hideki Tōjō and became involved in war bond rallies. McPherson sold $150,000 worth of bonds in one hour in 1942, breaking previous records, then repeated the performance in 1944. The U.S. Treasury awarded her a special citation, and the U.S. Army made McPherson an honorary colonel. Her wartime activities included sermons linking the church and patriotism. She felt that if the Allies did not prevail, churches, homes, and everything dear to Christians would be destroyed.

McPherson&#x27;s embrace of the total war strategy of the United States left her open to some criticism. The line between the church as an independent moral authority monitoring government became blurred. Japanese Americans&#x27; internment in relocation camps was overlooked, and she refused to allow her denomination to support Christians who remained pacifist. Church members and leaders were expected to be willing to take up arms. The pacifist clause, by her proposal, was eliminated by the Foursquare Church.

==Death==
On September 26, 1944, McPherson went to Oakland, California, for a series of revivals, planning to preach her popular &quot;Story of My Life&quot; sermon. When McPherson&#x27;s son went to her hotel room at 10:00 the next morning, he found her unconscious with pills and a half-empty bottle of capsules nearby. She was dead by 11:15. It was later discovered that she had called her doctor that morning complaining of feeling ill from the medicine, but he was in surgery. She then phoned another doctor who referred her to yet another physician. McPherson lost consciousness before the third physician could be contacted.

The autopsy revealed a heart attack that was likely caused by an overdose of sleeping pills. McPherson had been taking sleeping pills following numerous health problems. Among the pills found in her hotel room was the barbiturate secobarbital, a strong sedative which had not been prescribed for her; it was unknown how she obtained the pills. Given the circumstances, there was speculation about suicide, but most sources generally agree the overdose was accidental.

Forty-five thousand people waited in long lines, some until 2 a.m., to file past the evangelist whose body lay in state for three days at the Temple. It later took 11 trucks to transport the $50,000 worth of flowers to the cemetery. Though they had left McPherson&#x27;s employ on bad terms, her former assistant pastor Rheba Crawford Splivalo, McPherson&#x27;s daughter Roberta, and her mother Mildred Kennedy were also in attendance.

An observer, Marcus Bach, wrote:

Millions of dollars passed through McPherson&#x27;s hands during her life, however her personal estate, when calculated, amounted to only $10,000. Her daughter, Roberta, received $2,000; the remainder went to her son, Rolf. By contrast, her mother Mildred Kennedy had a 1927 severance settlement amounting to as much as $200,000 in cash and property; the Foursquare Church was worth $2.8 million.

McPherson is buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. Following her death, the Foursquare Church denomination was led for 44 years by her son Rolf McPherson.

==Legacy and influence==
After her death, the largely negative aspect of her media image persisted and became the dominant factor in defining McPherson for many in the public. Shuler, whose caustic view of McPherson softened over the years, wrote that McPherson&#x27;s flaws were many, yet she ultimately made a positive lasting impact on Christianity. He recognized her appeal as a combination of identifying with average citizens and an ability to preach in simple terms. Her legacy continued through the thousands of ministers she trained and churches planted worldwide. McPherson helped to reshape evangelical Christianity, making it relevant to American culture and personally involving for listeners.
McPherson influenced later ministers including child preacher Uldine Utley and Dr. Edwin Louis Cole, who went on to found the Christian Men&#x27;s Network. Biographer Matthew Sutton wrote that McPherson helped to forestall the replacement of traditional Protestantism by new scientific and philosophical ideas. Liberal Christianity, which was growing in the late 19th century, regarded Biblical miracles as superstition or metaphor. McPherson&#x27;s faith-healing ministry promoted the idea that miraculous healings could occur in modern times.

McPherson&#x27;s ecumenical approach assisted Pentecostals in explaining their faith in the context of historic church doctrine. Mainline churches became exposed to differing beliefs about gifts of the Holy Spirit. They borrowed Pentecostal revival techniques including emotive expression, praise worship, and testimonials, forerunning the Charismatic Movement.

McPherson challenged expectations for women. Her gender and divorces were of particular concern to many fundamentalist churches with which she wanted to work. However, atheist Charles Lee Smith remarked that she had an extraordinary mind, &quot;particularly for a woman&quot;.

Her continual work at church alliance-building finally bore posthumous fruit. Foursquare Gospel Church leaders joined the National Association of Evangelicals in 1952 and helped organize the Pentecostal World Fellowship. Pentecostalism, which once advocated separatism and was on the fringes of Protestantism, became part of mainstream Christianity. The Foursquare church claims a membership of over 7.9 million worldwide in 2019.

==Portrayals==
McPherson was the subject of or inspiration for numerous books, films, plays, and television shows. A musical titled &quot;AIMEE!&quot;, by Patrick Young and Bob Ashley, was produced in 1981 in Canada. Kathie Lee Gifford, David Friedman, and David Pomeranz, wrote the biographical musical &quot;&quot;, which was produced on Broadway in 2012 starring Carolee Carmello as McPherson. (An earlier version of this musical was titled &quot;Saving Aimee&quot;.) &quot;An Evangelist Drowns&quot; (2007), a one-woman play based on McPherson&#x27;s life, includes fictionalized accounts of relationships with Charlie Chaplin and David Hutton. &quot;Spit Shine Glisten&quot; (2013), loosely based on the life of McPherson, was performed at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, Santa Clarita. The musical &quot;Vanishing Point&quot;, written by Rob Hartmann, Liv Cummins, and Scott Keys, intertwines the lives of evangelist McPherson, aviator Amelia Earhart, and mystery writer Agatha Christie. It was included in the 2010–2011 season at the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama in Pittsburgh.

A television film about the events which surrounded McPherson&#x27;s 1926 disappearance, &quot;The Disappearance of Aimee&quot; (1976), starred Faye Dunaway as McPherson and Bette Davis as her mother. The movie &quot;Sister Aimee&quot; (2019), starring Amy Hargreaves, is a fictional account of McPherson&#x27;s 1926 disappearance. In 2020, two American television series featured characters based on McPherson: Sister Molly Finnister (Kerry Bishé) in &quot;Penny Dreadful: City of Angels&quot; and Sister Alice McKeegan (Tatiana Maslany) in &quot;Perry Mason&quot;.

Characters who were modeled on McPherson included Sharon Falconer in Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s novel &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; (played by Jean Simmons in the film adaptation), faith-healing evangelist Big Sister in Nathanael West&#x27;s &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; (played by Geraldine Page in the film adaptation) and corrupt small-town minister Eli Watkins in Upton Sinclair&#x27;s novel &quot;Oil!&quot; (portrayed by Paul Dano in the novel&#x27;s loose adaptation &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot;). The characters of Mrs. Melrose Ape in Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s novel &quot;Vile Bodies&quot; and Reno Sweeney in Cole Porter&#x27;s musical comedy &quot;Anything Goes&quot; are inspired by McPherson&#x27;s habit of traveling with a troupe of young women who would portray &quot;angels&quot; in her ministry events. Frank Capra&#x27;s film &quot;The Miracle Woman&quot; (1931), starring Barbara Stanwyck, was based on John Meehan&#x27;s play &quot;Bless You, Sister&quot;, which was reportedly inspired by McPherson&#x27;s life.

The character of Edith Keeler portrayed by actress Joan Collins in the episode titled “A City on the Edge of Forever” from the television series Star Trek (The Original Series) was inspired by Aimee Semple McPherson.
In their book “These Are the Voyages: TOS, Season One”, authors Marc Cushman and Susan Osborn note that Harlan Ellison (writer of City on the Edge of Forever) was reading a biography of Aimee Semple McPherson while working on his script. This is backed up by Ellison himself, on page 77 of the published version of his original, unedited teleplay.

<doc id="205175" wikidata="Q933459" url="?curid=205175" title="Goeree-Overflakkee">
<text>Goeree-Overflakkee () is the southernmost delta island of the province of South Holland, Netherlands. It is separated from Voorne-Putten and Hoeksche Waard by the Haringvliet, from the mainland of North Brabant by the Volkerak, and from Schouwen-Duiveland by Lake Grevelingen.

Since 2013, Goeree-Overflakkee has also been a municipality consisting, from west to east, of the former municipalities of Goedereede, Dirksland, Middelharnis, and Oostflakkee. The largest towns are Sommelsdijk, Middelharnis, Ouddorp, and Dirksland.

Despite being part of the province of South Holland, the island&#x27;s scenery and dialect are more closely related to Zeeland than to Holland. On the island they speak a form of Zeelandic, namely in the west and in the east.

==History==
The island was detached from the mainland when the Haringvliet formed as a result of two major flooding events. The first was in 1216, which breached the dunes of Voorne and created a deep saltwater inlet. In the St. Elizabeth floods of 1421, this inlet connected to the Merwede and became an important estuary of the Rhine and Meuse rivers.

== Politics ==
The municipal council of Goeree-Overflakkee has of 31 members which, after the 2022 municipal elections, were divided as follows:

== Former municipalities ==

=== Goedereede ===

From west to east the former municipality of Goedereede consists of Ouddorp (with Oostdijk), Goedereede (with Havenhoofd), and Stellendam. Income comes mainly of tourism and fishery. With a long beach nearby, Ouddorp is a tourist attraction and has a number of camping sites. Goedereede and Stellendam both have an extended fishing fleet. The town of Goedereede has many old buildings and a tall church tower. Goedereede is one of two towns on the island that obtained city rights. Stellendam was hit hard in the 1953 storm flood and several monuments in the town commemorate this tragedy. Next to Stellendam lies the Haringvlietdam which shelters the Haringvliet from the North Sea, this dam is part of the Delta Project. On the island side of the dam a &#x27;Delta Expo&#x27; provides a guide to the dam.

=== Dirksland ===

The former municipality of Dirksland consisted of Melissant, Herkingen, and Dirksland. The 1953 flood did not have such an effect on these places, as they are mainly lie on higher ground than the rest of the island. Dirksland was the biggest of the three and also has the only hospital on the island. The Van Weel-Bethesda hospital is one of the smallest in the country, but has an excellent reputation, confirmed by national hospital grade polls. Dirksland is recognizable from a distance by the biggest water tower of the country. The towns are agriculturally focused and also have several camp sites. Dirksland has an inland harbor with a newly restored gate complex. Herkingen lies on the south side of the island and borders the Grevelingenmeer, a saltwater lake that has been disconnected directly from the North Sea by the Brouwersdam, but still connects to the Oosterschelde which is saltwater. The Grevelingenmeer is a large watersports area with the main recreational areas on Schouwen-Duiveland. Herkingen is trying to join in with the tourism industry and has quite a large yachting harbor. The town of Herkingen currently hosts several of the biggest modern windmills in the country.

=== Middelharnis ===

The former municipality of Middelharnis, forming the center of the island, was the biggest of the four with over 17,000 inhabitants. It consisted of Sommelsdijk, Middelharnis, Nieuwe-Tonge, and Stad aan &#x27;t Haringvliet. Middelharnis has a shopping area called &quot;D&#x27;n Diek&quot;. This shopping center settled itself on a dike which used to be the last barrier for the towns from the Haringvliet. Now extensive, this dike and the area is enjoying a huge face lift. On Fridays in the summer months, there are what are called the Diekdagen (Dike days in English), with special activities like sports car racing and bicycle racing in the middle of the town. The town hosts a public high school and a Christian high school. Middelharnis has an inland harbor with a connection to the Haringvliet. In Middelharnis the old municipality building lies on the main street. In Sommelsdijk there is a sport complex with swimming pool, called &quot;De Staver&quot;. Stad aan &#x27;t Haringvliet has a small harbor with a beach. Like most of the towns on the island the old windmill has been preserved. Nieuwe-Tonge&#x27;s main entry roads are the two dikes that form the edges of the town.

=== Oostflakkee ===

The former municipality of Oostflakkee consists of: Den Bommel (with Zuidzijde), Oude-Tonge, Ooltgensplaat, Achthuizen, and Langstraat. Oude-Tonge was the main town of the former municipality with a considerable industrial area. It also has a large bus station. Oude-Tonge suffered most in 1953 flood and was visited by the queen in 2003 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of this event. Den Bommel has a harbor and beach on the shores of the Haringvliet. A few kilometres east of Den Bommel is Zuidzijde, a very small town. Ooltgensplaat is the most eastward town on the island with a harbor on the Volkerak. The town has a very old municipal building. This town hosts the start and finish of De Omloop – an annual 100+ km walk around the island within a 24-hour period. It is held in the latter half of August and attracts thousands, both participants and spectators. Achthuizen and Langstraat are other small towns nearby Ooltgensplaat.

<doc id="205178" wikidata="Q646764" url="?curid=205178" title="TIROS-1">
<text>TIROS-1 (or TIROS-A) was the first full-scale weather satellite (the Vanguard 2 satellite was the first experimental/prototype weather satellite), the first of a series of Television Infrared Observation Satellites (TIROS) placed in low Earth orbit.

== Program ==

The TIROS Program was NASA&#x27;s first experimental step to determine if satellites could be useful in the study of the Earth. At that time, the effectiveness of satellite observations was still unproven. Since satellites were a new technology, the TIROS Program also tested various design issues for spacecraft: instruments, data and operational parameters. The goal was to improve satellite applications for Earth-bound decisions, such as &quot;should we evacuate the coast because of the hurricane?&quot;.

The TIROS-1 Program&#x27;s first priority was the development of a meteorological satellite information system. Weather forecasting was deemed the most promising application of space-based observations.

== Spacecraft ==

TIROS 1 was an 18-sided right prism, across opposite corners and high.

Spacecraft power was supplied by approximately 9000 - by silicon solar cells mounted on the cover assembly and by 21 nickel-cadmium batteries.

A single monopole antenna for reception of ground commands extended out from the top of the cover assembly. A pair of crossed-dipole antennas (235 MHz) for transmission projected down and diagonally out from the baseplate. Mounted around the edge of the baseplate were five diametrically opposed pairs of small, solid-fuel thrusters that maintained the satellite spin rate between 8 and 12 rpm.

The satellite was equipped with two -diameter vidicon TV cameras, one wide angle and one narrow angle, for taking earth cloud cover pictures. The pictures were transmitted directly to a ground receiving station or were stored in a magnetic tape recorder on board for later playback, depending on whether the satellite was within or beyond the communication range of the station. The satellite was spin-stabilized.

== Mission ==
Launched into orbit from Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 17A on 1 Apr 1960 at 11:40:09 UTC by a Thor Able II rocket.

Over its -month lifespan, TIROS 1 returned 23,000 photos of the Earth, 19,000 of them usable for weather analysis. For the first time, it was possible to view large scale cloud patterns in their totality, and from this, identify storm regions. The satellite provided the first long-term observations of a developing storm from orbit, tracking the disintegration of a large cyclonic mass off the coast of Bermuda over the course of four days. In addition, TIROS 1 returned data on smaller scale structures such as tornadoes and jet streams, and findings returned from the satellite complemented and enhanced ground-based findings.

TIROS 1 performed normally from launch until June 15, 1960, when an electrical power failure prevented further useful TV transmission.

, TIROS 1 remains in orbit.

<doc id="205187" wikidata="Q861623" url="?curid=205187" title="Education in the Netherlands">
<text>Education in the Netherlands is characterized by division: education is oriented toward the needs and background of the pupil. Education is divided over schools for different age groups, some of which are divided in streams for different educational levels. Schools are furthermore divided in public, special (religious), and general-special (neutral) schools, although there are also a few private schools. The Dutch grading scale runs from 1 (very poor) to 10 (outstanding).

The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), coordinated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), ranks the education in the Netherlands as the 16th best in the world as of 2018. The Netherlands&#x27; educational standing compared to other nations has been declining since 2006, and is now only slightly above average. School inspectors are warning that reading standards among primary school children are lower than 20 years ago, and the Netherlands has now dropped down the international rankings. A similar trend is seen in writing and reading, maths and science. The country has an on-going teacher shortage and lack of new teachers.

The average OECD performance of Dutch 15-year-olds in science and mathematics has declined, with the share of low performers in reading, mathematics and science developing a sharp upward trend. The share of top performers in mathematics and science has also declined.

==General overview==
Educational policy is coordinated by the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science with municipal governments.

Compulsory education (&#x27;) in the Netherlands starts at the age of five, although in practice, most schools accept children from the age of four. From the age of sixteen there is a partial compulsory education (&#x27;), meaning a pupil must attend some form of education for at least two days a week. Compulsory education ends for pupils aged eighteen and up or when they get a diploma on the VWO, HAVO or MBO-2 level.

Public, special (religious), and general-special (neutral) schools are government-financed, receiving equal financial support from the government if certain criteria are met. Although they are officially free of charge, these schools may ask for a parental contribution (&quot;&quot;). Private schools rely on their own funds, but they are highly uncommon in the Netherlands, to the extent that even the Dutch monarchs have traditionally attended special or public schools. Public schools are controlled by local governments. Special schools are controlled by a school board and are typically based on a particular religion; those that assume equality between religions are known as general-special schools. These differences are present in all levels of education.

As a result, there can be Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and Muslim elementary schools, high schools, and universities. A special school can reject applications of pupils whose parents or guardians disagree with the school&#x27;s educational philosophy, but this is uncommon. In practice, there is little difference between special schools and public schools, except in traditionally religious areas of the Dutch Bible Belt. All school types (public, special and private) are under the jurisdiction of a government body called &#x27; (Inspection of Education, also known as &#x27;) that can demand a school to change its educational policy and quality at the risk of closure.

In elementary and high schools, pupils are assessed annually by a team of teachers who determine whether they advanced enough to move on to the next grade. Forcing a pupil to retake the year (; literally, &quot;remain seated&quot;) has a profound impact on the pupil&#x27;s life in terms of social contacts and remaining in the educational system longer, but is very common, even in the most academic streams such as Gymnasium. Some schools are more likely to choose this option than others. In some schools mechanisms are in place to avert retaking years, such as remedial teaching and other forms of guidance or making them go to a different type of schooling, such as moving down from HAVO to VMBO. Retaking a year is also common in elementary schools. Gifted children are sometimes granted the opportunity to skip an entire year, yet this happens rarely and usually happens in elementary schools.

==Elementary education==
Between the ages of four and twelve, children attend elementary school (&#x27;; literally, &quot;foundation school&quot;). This school has eight grades, called &#x27; (group 1) through &quot;&quot; (group 8). School attendance is not necessary until group 2 (at age five), but almost all children commence school at age four (in group 1). Groups 1 and 2 used to be held in a separate institution akin to kindergarten (&quot;kleuterschool&quot;), until it was merged with elementary schools in 1985. Kindergartens continued to exist however, for children under the age of 5.

From group 3 on, children learn how to read, write and do arithmetic. Most schools teach English in groups 7 and 8, but some start as early as group 1. In group 8 the vast majority of schools administer an aptitude test called the &#x27; (literally, &quot;Cito final test [of] primary education&quot;, often abbreviated to &#x27; (Cito test), developed by the &quot;&quot; (Central Institute for Test Development)), which is designed to recommend the type of secondary education best suited for a pupil. In recent years, this test has gained authority, but the recommendation of the group 8 teacher along with the opinion of the pupil and his/her parents remains the crucial factor in choosing the right form of secondary education.

The Cito test is not mandatory; some schools instead administer the &#x27; (&quot;Dutch intelligence test for educational level&quot;, usually abbreviated to &quot;NIO-toets&quot;) or the &#x27; (&quot;School final test&quot;).

A considerable number of elementary schools are mostly based on a particular educational philosophy, for instance the Montessori Method, Pestalozzi Plan, Dalton Plan, Jena Plan, or Freinet. Most of these are public schools, but some special schools also base themselves on one of these educational philosophies.

==Secondary education==
After attending elementary education, children in the Netherlands (by that time usually 12 years old) go directly to high school (&quot;&quot;; literally &quot;continued education&quot;). Informed by the advice of the elementary school and the results of the Cito test, a choice is made for either &quot;voorbereidend middelbaar beroepsonderwijs&quot; (VMBO), &quot;hoger algemeen voortgezet onderwijs&quot; (HAVO) or &quot;voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs&quot; (VWO) by the pupil and their parents. When it is not clear which type of secondary education best suits a pupil, or if the parents insist their child can handle a higher level of education than what was recommended to them, there is an orientation year for both VMBO/HAVO and HAVO/VWO to determine this. At some schools, it is not possible to do HAVO the 1st year, instead requiring students take the combination year. After one or two years, the pupil will continue in the normal curriculum of either level. A high school can offer one or more levels of education, at one or multiple locations. A focus on (financial) efficiency has led to more centralization, with large schools that offer education on all or most educational levels.

Because the Dutch educational system normally does not have middle schools or junior high schools, the first year of all levels in Dutch high schools is referred to as the &#x27; (literally &quot;bridge class&quot;), as it connects the elementary school system to the secondary education system. During this year, pupils will gradually learn to cope with the differences between school systems, such as dealing with increased personal responsibility. Sometimes people also call the second year &quot;brugklas&quot;. Although the Dutch educational system in general does not have middle schools, there are around 10 official middle schools (called &#x27;) which replace 7th and 8th grade of middle school and 1st and 2nd year of high school.

It is possible for pupils who have attained the VMBO diploma to attend the final two years of HAVO level education and sit the HAVO exam, and for pupils with a HAVO diploma to attend the final two years of VWO level education and sit the VWO exam. The underlying rationale is that this grants pupils access to a more advanced level of higher education. This system acts as a safety net to diminish the negative effects of a child&#x27;s immaturity or lack of self-knowledge. For example, when a bright pupil was sent to VMBO because they were unmotivated but later discovered their potential or has acquired the desire to achieve better, the pupil can still attain a higher level by moving on to HAVO, spending only one more year at school. Most schools do require a particular grade average to ensure the pupil is capable of handling the increased study load and higher difficulty level.

Aside from moving up, there is also a system in place where pupils can be demoted to a lower level of education. When for example a pupil has entered secondary education at a level they cannot cope with, or when they lack the interest to spend effort on their education resulting in poor grades, they can be sent from VWO to HAVO, from HAVO to VMBO, and from any level of VMBO to a lower level of VMBO.

===VMBO===

The VMBO (&quot;voorbereidend middelbaar beroepsonderwijs&quot;; literally &quot;preparatory middle-level applied education&quot;, in international terms &quot;pre-vocational education&quot;) education lasts four years, from the age of twelve to sixteen. It combines vocational training with theoretical education in languages, mathematics, history, arts and sciences. Sixty percent of students nationally are enrolled in VMBO. Students cannot choose between the four different levels of VMBO that differ in the ratio of practical vocational training and theoretical education, but the level depends from the score. Not all levels are necessarily taught in the same high school.
*&quot;&quot; (VMBO-TL; literally &quot;theoretical learning path&quot;) has the largest share of theoretical education. It prepares for middle management and the MBO level of tertiary education, and allows students to resume vocational training at HAVO level. It was previously known as &quot;MAVO&quot;.
*&quot;&quot; (VMBO-GL; literally &quot;mixed learning path&quot;) is in between VMBO-TL and VMBO-KBL. The progression route to graduation is similar to the VMBO-TL.
*&quot;&quot; (VMBO-KBL; literally &quot;middle management-oriented learning path&quot;) is composed of an equal amount of theoretical education and vocational training. It prepares for middle management and vocational training at the MBO level of tertiary education.
*&quot;&quot; (VMBO-BBL; literally &quot;basic profession-oriented learning path&quot;) emphasizes vocational training and prepares for vocational training at the MBO level of tertiary education.
*&quot;&quot; (literally &quot;practical education&quot;) mainly consists of vocational training. It is tailored to pupils who would otherwise not be able to obtain a VMBO-diploma. This form of on-the-job training is aimed at allowing pupils to enter the job market directly.

At all of these levels, &quot;&quot; (literally &quot;learning path supporting education&quot;) is offered, which is intended for pupils with educational or behavioural problems. These pupils are taught in small classes by specialized teachers.

====VMBO curriculum====
During the first two years, Dutch pupils are taught mathematics, Dutch, English, physical education, arts, and either history, geography, or a combined subject called &#x27; or &quot;M&amp;M&quot;, meaning human and society in Dutch. They also get at least one year education in: biology, sex education (in public non-religious schools), arithmetics, economics (if not included in &#x27;), a technical subject, and a combination subject of physics and chemistry called NaSk.

===== VMBO BB and KB =====
For their third and fourth year, VMBO BB and VMBO KB students have five core subjects in the curriculum: Dutch, English, CKV (standing for &quot;&quot;, &quot;cultural and artistic education&quot;), civics, and physical education. They also get to choose two subjects via their chosen study program. There are ten official study programs.

Students also choose two vocational subjects of their liking. Most schools offer only a limited selection of these programs, and some specialised schools only offer a single study program. At the end of the four years, the students take an exam in their two chosen subjects, as well as in Dutch and English.

===== VMBO GL &amp; TL =====
VMBO GL or TL students need to follow a second foreign language in their first two years or the last two years of secondary school. Four programs are offered in this curriculum: Care &amp; Welfare, Economics, Tech, and Green (&quot;Agriculture&quot;) these are all equivalent to the programs of VMBO BB and KB. Besides this, students choose two subjects of their own liking. Because of this, more subjects are offered, such as NaSk2, arts, music, and LO2, an advanced physical education course.

===Selective secondary education===
Secondary education, which begins at the age of 12 and, as of 2008, is compulsory until the age of 18, is offered at several levels. The two programmes of general education that lead to higher education are HAVO (five years) and VWO (six years). Pupils are enrolled according to their ability, and although VWO is more rigorous, both HAVO and VWO can be characterised as selective types of secondary education. The HAVO diploma is the minimum requirement for admission to HBO (universities of applied sciences) but HBO admission is also possible upon achieving a diploma at MBO level. The VWO curriculum prepares pupils for university, and the VWO diploma grants access to WO (research universities), but it is also possible to enter WO universities after successfully completing the &quot;propaedeuse&quot; (first year) of HBO.

====Curriculum====
The first three years of both HAVO and VWO are called the (&quot;basic formation&quot;). All pupils follow the same subjects: Dutch, mathematics, English, history, arts, at least two other foreign languages (mostly German and French), biology, physical education, geography, at least some form of arithmetic which since the school year of 2022/2023 can be given in combination with math and some form of physics and chemistry, usually combined into a single subject ( or ). During the third year students get a bit more controlled curriculum because they need to be at the level VMBO students must have reached for their exam. Because of this they get physics and chemistry taught as two different subjects, and they get economics as a subject. The last two years of HAVO and the last three years of VWO are referred to as the second phase (), or upper secondary education. This part of the educational programme allows for differentiation by means of subject clusters that are called &quot;profiles&quot; (). A profile is a set of different subjects that will make up for the largest part of the pupil&#x27;s timetable. It emphasizes a specific area of study in which the pupil specializes. Compared to the HAVO route, the difficulty level of the profiles at the VWO is higher, lasts three years instead of two and requires a foreign language on atheneum and a classic language (Latin or Ancient Greek) on gymnasium level. Pupils pick one of four profiles towards the end of their third year:
*&quot;Cultuur en Maatschappij&quot; (C&amp;M; literally &quot;culture and society&quot;) emphasizes arts and foreign languages. A student needs to take a foreign language (French, German and occasionally Spanish, Russian, Arabic and Turkish). In the province of Friesland, West Frisian is also taught. An art class must be taken like drawing, visual arts or music. History is mandatory in this profile. On HAVO C&amp;M is the only profile where mathematics is not required. On VWO the mathematics classes are math A or math C, both focusing on statistics and stochastics but whilst math A in the last year focuses on harder math like parts of calculus, math C is more repetition of previous math. This profile prepares for artistic and cultural training.
*&quot;Economie en Maatschappij&quot; (E&amp;M; literally &quot;economy and society&quot;) emphasizes social sciences and economics. In this profile history and economics (macro-economics) are mandatory. The mathematics class is math A which focuses on statistics and stochastics. Beside this a student on HAVO can choose geography, business economics (micro-economics) or a foreign language. VWO can only choose one of the first two. This profile prepares for management and business administration.
*&quot;Natuur en Gezondheid&quot; (N&amp;G; literally &quot;nature and health&quot;) emphasizes biology and natural sciences. A student must take chemistry and biology The mathematics classes are math A which focuses on statistics or stochastics and math B which focuses on algebra, geometry and calculus. A student must also choose either geography or physics. This profile is necessary to attend higher medical training.
*&quot;Natuur en Techniek&quot; (N&amp;T; literally &quot;nature and technology&quot;) emphasizes natural sciences. A student must take physics, chemistry and math B which focuses on algebra, geometry and calculus, and must choose biology or either &quot;nature, life and technology&quot; (NLT) or informatics (computer science); this depends on the school. This profile is necessary to attend technological and natural science training.

Because each profile is designed to prepare pupils for certain areas of study at the tertiary level, some HBO and WO studies require a specific profile because prerequisite knowledge is required. For example, one cannot study engineering without having attained a certificate in physics at the secondary educational level. Aside from the subjects in the profile, the curriculum is composed of a compulsory segment that includes Dutch, English, mathematics, civics and &quot;cultural and artistic education&quot; (CKV), and a free choice segment in which pupils can choose one subject of their liking. Picking particular subjects in the free curriculum space can result in multiple profiles, especially the profiles N&amp;G and N&amp;T that overlap to a large extent. Students then have a NG&amp;NT profile. The requirement is to have a N&amp;T profile with biology or a N&amp;G with physics and math B. In the free choice section other subjects not offered in the profiles can also be offered like &quot;—BSM&quot; (advanced physical education) and &quot;maatschappijwetenschappen&quot; (social sciences).

====HAVO====

The HAVO (&quot;hoger algemeen voortgezet onderwijs&quot;; literally &quot;higher general continued education&quot;) has five grades and is attended from age twelve to seventeen. A HAVO diploma provides access to the HBO level (polytechnic) of tertiary education.

====VWO====

The VWO (&quot;voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs&quot;; literally &quot;preparatory scientific education&quot;) has six grades and is typically attended from age twelve to eighteen. A VWO diploma provides access to WO training, although universities may set their own admission criteria (e.g. based on profile or on certain subjects).

The VWO is divided into &quot;atheneum&quot; and &quot;gymnasium&quot;. A gymnasium programme is similar to the atheneum, except that Latin and Greek are compulsory courses. Not all schools teach the ancient languages throughout the first three years (the &quot;basic training&quot;), but if they do, Latin may start in either the first or the second year, while Greek may start in the second or third. At the end of the third and sometimes fourth year, a pupil may decide to take one or both languages in the second three years (the second phase), when the education in ancient languages is combined with education in ancient culture. The subject that they choose, although technically compulsory, is subtracted from their free space requirement.

&quot;VWO-plus&quot;, also known as &quot;atheneum-plus&quot;, &quot;VWO+&quot;, &quot;Masterclass&quot; or &quot;lyceum&quot;, offers extra subjects like philosophy, additional foreign languages and courses to introduce students to scholarly research. Schools offer this option rarely and sometimes only for the first three years, it is not an official school level.

Some schools offer bilingual VWO (&quot;Tweetalig VWO&quot;, or TVWO), where the majority of the lessons are taught in English. In some schools near the Dutch–German border, pupils may choose a form of TVWO that offers 50% of the lessons in German and 50% in Dutch.

====VAVO====
VAVO (&quot;Voortgezet algemeen volwassenen onderwijs&quot;; literally &quot;extended general adult education&quot;) is an adult school, which teaches VMBO/MAVO, HAVO or VWO, for students who in the past were unable to receive their diploma, who want to receive certificates for certain subjects only, or who for example received their diploma for HAVO but want to receive their VWO-diploma within one or two years.

===International education===
As of January 2015, the International Schools Consultancy (ISC) listed the Netherlands as having 152 international schools. ISC defines an &#x27;international school&#x27; in the following terms &quot;ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country&#x27;s national curriculum and is international in its orientation.&quot; This definition is used by publications including The Economist.

==Vocational education and higher education==
In the Netherlands there are 3 main educational routes after secondary education:

* MBO (middle-level applied education), which is the equivalent of junior college education. Designed to prepare students for either skilled trades and technical occupations and workers in support roles in professions such as engineering, accountancy, business administration, nursing, medicine, architecture, and criminology or for additional education at another college with more advanced academic material.
* HBO (higher professional education), which is the equivalent of college education and has a professional orientation. The HBO is taught in vocational universities (hogescholen), of which there are over 40 in the Netherlands. Note that the hogescholen are not allowed to name themselves university in Dutch. This also stretches to English and therefore HBO institutions are known as universities of applied sciences.
* WO (Scientific education), which is the equivalent of university level education and has an academic orientation.

HBO graduates can be awarded with the Dutch title Baccalaureus (bc.) or Ingenieur (ing.). Usually their diploma states the English title Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Laws (LLB) or Bachelor of Science (BSc). Instead of a BA, LLB or BSc, it&#x27;s also possible that they receive a title which mentions the studied subject, for example Bachelor of Social Work or Bachelor of Nursing.

At a WO institution the following bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s titles can be awarded. Bachelor&#x27;s degrees: Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Science (BSc) and Bachelor of Laws (LLB). Master&#x27;s degrees: Master of Arts (MA), Master of Laws (LLM) and Master of Science (MSc). The PhD title is a research degree awarded upon completion and defense of a doctoral thesis.

===Vocational education===
====MBO====
The MBO (&quot;&quot;; literally &quot;middle-level applied education&quot;) is oriented towards vocational training and is the equivalent of junior college education. Many pupils with a VMBO-diploma attend MBO. The MBO lasts one to four years, depending on the level. There are 4 levels offered to students:
*MBO level 1: Assistant training. It lasts 1 year maximum. It is focused on simple executive tasks. If the student graduates, they can apply to MBO level 2.
*MBO level 2: Basic vocational education. The programme lasts 2 to 3 years and is focused on executive tasks.
*MBO level 3: The programme lasts 3 to 4 years. Students are taught to achieve their tasks independently.
*MBO level 4: Middle Management VET. It lasts 3 to 4 years and prepares for jobs with higher responsibility. It also opens the gates to Higher education.
At all levels, MBO offers 2 possible pathways: a school-based education, where Training within a company takes between 20 and 59% of the curriculum, or an apprenticeship education, where this training represents more than 60% of the study time. Both paths lead to the same certification. Students in MBO are mostly between 16 and 35. Students of the &quot;apprenticeship&quot; path are overall older (25+).
After MBO (4 years), pupils can enroll in HBO or enter the job market. Many different MBO studies are typically offered at a &quot;regionaal opleidingen centrum&quot; (ROC; literally &quot;regional education center&quot;). Most ROCs are concentrated on one or several locations in larger cities. Exceptions include schools offering specialized MBO studies such as agriculture, and schools adapted to pupils with a learning disability that require training in small groups or at an individual level.

===Higher education===

Higher education in the Netherlands is offered at two types of institutions: universities of applied sciences (&quot;hogescholen&quot;; HBO), open to graduates of HAVO, VWO, and MBO-4, and research universities (&quot;universiteiten&quot;; WO) open only to VWO-graduates and HBO graduates (including HBO &quot;propaedeuse&quot;-graduates). The former comprise general institutions and institutions specializing in a particular field, such as agriculture, fine and performing arts, or educational training, while the latter comprise twelve general universities as well as three technical universities.

Since September 2002, the higher education system in the Netherlands has been organised around a three-cycle system consisting of bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and PhD degrees, to conform and standardize the teaching in both the HBO and the WO according to the Bologna process. At the same time, the ECTS credit system was adopted as a way of quantifying a student&#x27;s workload (both contact hours, and hours spent studying and preparing assignments). Under Dutch law, one credit represents 28 hours of work and 60 credits represents one year of full-time study. Both systems have been adopted to improve international recognition and compliance.

Despite these changes, the binary system with a distinction between research-oriented education and professional higher education remains in use. These three types of degree programmes differ in terms of the number of credits required to complete the programme and the degree that is awarded. A WO bachelor&#x27;s programme requires the completion of 180 credits (3 years) and graduates obtain the degree of Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Laws degree (B.A./B.Sc./LL.B.), depending on the discipline. An HBO bachelor&#x27;s programme requires the completion of 240 credits (4 years), and graduates obtain the title Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Laws (LLB) or Bachelor of Science (BSc), or a degree indicating their field of study, for example Bachelor of Engineering (B. Eng.) or Bachelor of Nursing (B. Nursing). The old title appropriate to the discipline in question (bc., ing.) may still be used.

Master&#x27;s programmes at the WO level mostly require the completion of 60 or 120 credits (1 or 2 years). Some programmes require 90 (1.5 years) or more than 120 credits. In engineering, agriculture, mathematics, and the natural sciences, 120 credits are always required, while in (veterinary) medicine or pharmacy the master&#x27;s phase requires 180 credits (3 years). Other studies that usually have 60-credit &quot;theoretical master&#x27;s programmes&quot; sometimes offer 120-credit technical or research masters. Graduates obtain the degree of Master of Arts, Master of Science, Master of Laws or the not legally recognized degree Master of Philosophy (M.A./M.Sc./LL.M./M.Phil.), depending on the discipline. The old title appropriate to the discipline in question (drs., mr., ir.) may still be used. Master&#x27;s programmes at the HBO level require the completion of 60 to 120 credits, and graduates obtain a degree indicating the field of study, for example Master of Social Work (MSW).

The third cycle of higher education is offered only by research universities, which are entitled to award the country&#x27;s highest academic degree, the doctorate, which entitles a person to use the title Doctor (Dr.). The process by which a doctorate is obtained is referred to as &quot;promotion&quot; (&quot;promotie&quot;). The doctorate is primarily a research degree, for which a dissertation based on original research must be written and publicly defended. This research is typically conducted while working at a university as a &quot;promovendus&quot; (research assistant).

====Requirements for admission====
To enroll in a WO bachelor&#x27;s programme, a student is required to hold a VWO diploma or to have completed the first year (60 credits) of an HBO programme resulting in a propaedeuse, often combined with additional (VWO) certificates. The minimum admission requirement for HBO is either a HAVO school diploma or a level-4 (highest) MBO diploma. In some cases, pupils are required to have completed a specific subject cluster. A quota (numerus fixus) applies to admission to certain programmes, primarily in the medical sciences, and places are allocated using a weighted lottery. Applicants older than 21 years who do not possess one of these qualifications can qualify for admission to higher education on the basis of an entrance examination and assessment.

For admission to all master&#x27;s programmes, a bachelor&#x27;s degree in one or more specified disciplines is required, in some cases in combination with other requirements. Graduates with an HBO bachelor&#x27;s may have to complete additional requirements for admission to a WO master&#x27;s programme. A pre-master programme may provide admission to a master&#x27;s programme in a different discipline than that of the bachelor&#x27;s degree.

====Accreditation and quality assurance====
A guaranteed standard of higher education is maintained through a national system of legal regulation and quality assurance.

The Ministry of Education, Culture and Science is responsible for legislation pertaining to education. A system of accreditation was introduced in 2002. Since then, the new Accreditation Organization of the Netherlands and Flanders (NVAO) has been responsible for accreditation. According to the section of the Dutch Higher Education Act that deals with the accreditation of higher education (2002), degree programmes offered by research universities and universities of professional education will be evaluated according to established criteria, and programmes that meet those criteria will be accredited, that is, recognised for a period of six years. Only accredited programmes are eligible for government funding, and students receive financial aid only when enrolled in an accredited programme. Only accredited programmes issue legally recognised degrees. Accredited programmes are listed in the publicly accessible Central Register of Higher Education Study Programmes (CROHO). Institutions are autonomous in their decision to offer non-accredited programmes, subject to internal quality assessment. These programmes do not receive government funding.

====HBO====
The HBO (&quot;Hoger beroepsonderwijs&quot;; literally &quot;higher professional education&quot;) is oriented towards higher learning and professional training. After HBO (typically 4–6 years), pupils can enroll in a (professional) master&#x27;s program (1–2 years) or enter the job market. In some situations, students with an MBO or a VWO diploma receive exemptions for certain courses, so the student can do HBO in three years. The HBO is taught in vocational universities (&quot;hogescholen&quot;), of which there are over 40 in the Netherlands, each of which offers a broad variety of programs, with the exception of some that specialize in arts or agriculture. Note that the &quot;hogescholen&quot; are not allowed to name themselves &quot;university&quot; in Dutch. This also stretches to English and therefore HBO institutions are known as universities of applied sciences.

====WO====
The WO (&quot;wetenschappelijk onderwijs&quot;; literally &quot;scientific education&quot;) is only taught at research universities. It is oriented towards higher learning in the arts or sciences. After the bachelor&#x27;s programme (typically 3 years), students can enroll in a master&#x27;s programme (typically 1, 2 or 3 years) or enter the job market. After gaining a master, a student can apply for a 3 or 4 year PhD candidate position at a university (NB a master&#x27;s degree is the mandatory entry level for the Dutch PhD program). There are four technical universities, an Open University, six general universities and four universities with unique specializations in the Netherlands, although the specialized universities have increasingly added more general studies to their curriculum.

==History of education==
A national system of education was introduced in the Netherlands around the year 1800. The &quot;Maatschappij tot Nut van &#x27;t Algemeen&quot; (&quot;Society for the Common Good&quot;) took advantage of the revolutionary tide in the Batavian Republic to propose a number of educational reforms. The School Act of 1806 encouraged the establishment of primary schools in all municipalities and instated provincial supervision. It also introduced a mandatory curriculum comprising Dutch language, reading, writing, and arithmetics. History, geography, and modern languages such as French, German and English were optional subjects. All newly established schools needed consent from the authorities or would be disbanded as freedom of education was not proclaimed until the Constitutional Reform of 1848. In addition to primary education, gymnasia (or Latin schools) and universities constituted higher education. What could be considered secondary education or vocational training was unregulated.

This situation changed in the second half of the nineteenth century in the wake of social and economic modernisation. In 1857, a Lower Education Act replaced the 1806 act, supplementing the mandatory curriculum with geometry, geography, history, natural sciences, and singing. Modern languages, mathematics, agronomy, gymnastics, drawing and needlework for girls were included as elective subjects. Schools offering one or more of these elective subjects were known as &quot;meer uitgebreid lager onderwijs&quot; (&quot;more comprehensive lower education&quot;) or mulo, which became a new type of secondary education. The Middle Education Act of 1863 introduced more types of secondary education at an intermediary level between mulo and gymnasium: the two-year &quot;burgerschool&quot; (&quot;civic school&quot;), the three or five-year &quot;hogere burgerschool&quot; (&quot;higher civic school&quot; or hbs) and the &quot;middelbare meisjesschool&quot; (&quot;middle girls&#x27; school&quot; or mms).

The 1857 Lower Education Act retained the strictly secular nature of public education, but introduced the right of religious communities to establish private schools of an explicitly religious nature. However, these &quot;special schools&quot; received no funding from the government. In 1878, the liberal government introduced a bill that significantly increased the quality of education school were required to offer. While for public schools the accompanying costs were compensated by the government, special schools were still expected to bear the costs themselves, which threatened the continued existence of many special schools. This led the confessionals to start a campaign for the equal funding of special religious education that would become known as the school struggle. Equal funding was achieved in the Pacification of 1917.

What resulted from the 1857 and 1863 acts was a stratified system where school types were grouped into three &quot;layers&quot; intended for different socioeconomic classes and designed around different educational philosophies. Lower education (primary schools, mulo and vocational schools) was designed to prepare children from working class or lower middle class backgrounds for a specific vocation. &quot;Middle&quot; education (mms, hbs and polytechnics) was intended to equip children from middle class backgrounds with general knowledge about modern society with which they could occupy leading positions in areas such as commerce and technology. Finally, higher education (gymnasium and university) was intended for the classical and intellectual education of children from upper middle and upper class backgrounds. This distinction between middle and higher education based on the type of education rather than the students&#x27; age would gradually alter in the twentieth century. From 1917 onward, an hbs diploma would grant access to a number of courses at universities, while the lyceum, combining hbs and gymnasium, became an increasingly common type of school.

The introduction of the so-called &quot;Kinderwetje&quot; (literally &quot;little children&#x27;s act&quot;) by legislator Samuel van Houten in 1874 forbade child labour under the age of 12. An amendment in 1900 led to compulsory education for children aged 6 to 12 in 1901. The introduction of compulsory education, in combination with the increasing complexity of the economy, led to a significant increase in children attending secondary education, especially from the 1920s onward.

Thus, by the 1960s, a range of school types existed:
* &quot;Kleuterschool&quot; - kindergarten (ages 4–6).
* &quot;Lagere school&quot; - primary education, (ages 6–12), followed by either;
** &quot;Individueel technisch onderwijs&quot; (ito; literally &quot;individual technical education&quot;) - now &quot;vmbo - praktijkonderwijs&quot; (ages 12–16).
** &quot;Ambachtsschool&quot; (vocational school) - comparable with &quot;vmbo - gemengde leerweg&quot;, but there was more emphasis on thorough technical knowledge (ages 12–16).
** &quot;(Meer) Uitgebreid lager onderwijs&quot; (mulo, later ulo; literally &quot;(more) comprehensive lower education&quot;) - comparable with &quot;vmbo - theoretical learning path&quot; (ages 12–16).
** &quot;Hogere burgerschool&quot; (hbs; literally &quot;higher civic school&quot;) - comparable with atheneum (ages 12–17).
** &quot;Middelbare meisjesschool&quot; (mms; literally &quot;middle girls&#x27; school&quot;) - comparable with havo (ages 12–17).
** &quot;Gymnasium&quot; - secondary education, comparable with atheneum with compulsory Greek and Latin added (ages 12 to 18). At the age of 15 one could choose between the alpha profile (&quot;gymnasium-α&quot;; mostly languages, including compulsory Greek and Latin) or the beta profile (&quot;gymnasium-β&quot;; mostly natural sciences and mathematics). A student wanting to complete &quot;gymnasium-β&quot; would have to pass exams in the languages Ancient Greek, Latin, French, German, English, Dutch (all consisting of three separate parts: an oral book report, a written essay, and a written summary), pass the sciences physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics (in mathematics, students were assigned to two of the three sub-fields analytic geometry/algebra, trigonometry, and solid geometry based on a draw), and attend history and geography, which were taught until the final year without examinations.
** &quot;Lyceum&quot; - a combination of gymnasium and hbs, with alpha and beta streams which pupils elected after a two-year (sometimes one-year) bridging period (ages 12–18).
* &quot;Middelbare&quot; and &quot;hogere technische school&quot; (mts/hts; literally middle and higher applied/technical training), similar to polytechnic education.
* University - only after completing hbs, mms, gymnasium or hts.

The different forms of secondary education were streamlined in the &quot;Wet op het voortgezet onderwijs&quot; (literally &quot;law on secondary education&quot;) in 1963 at the initiative of legislator Jo Cals. The law is more widely known as the &quot;Mammoetwet&quot; (literally, &quot;mammoth act&quot;), a name it got when ARP member of parliament Anton Bernard Roosjen was reported to have said &quot;Let that mammoth remain in fairyland&quot; because he considered the reforms too extensive. The law was enforced in 1968. It introduced four streams of secondary education, depending on the capabilities of the students (lts/vbo, mavo, havo and vwo) and expanded compulsory education to 9 years. In 1975 this was changed to 10 years.

The law created a system of secondary education on which the current secondary school is based albeit with significant adaptations. Reforms in the late 1990s aimed at introducing information management skills, increasing the pupils&#x27; autonomy and personal responsibility, and promoting integration between different subjects. Lts/vbo and mavo were fused into vmbo, while the structure of havo and vwo were changed by the introduction of a three-year &quot;basisvorming&quot; (primary secondary education; literally, &quot;basic forming&quot;), followed by the &quot;tweede fase&quot; (upper secondary education; literally, second phase&quot;). The &quot;basisvorming&quot; standardized subjects for the first three years of secondary education and introduced two new compulsory subjects (technical skills and care skills), while the &quot;tweede fase&quot; allowed for differentiation through profiles.

The influx and emancipation of workers from Islamic countries led to the introduction of Islamic schools. In 2003, in total 35 Islamic schools were in operation.

By 2004, the municipalities of the Netherlands were obliged to activate a regional care structure for individual students dealing with health and social problems. Each school was obliged to activate a care team at least composed by a physician/nurse, a school social worker and the school care coordinator. In the context of the schoolBeat project, each primary and secondary school of the Maastricht region designated a professional advisor who was employed by a drug prevention, welfare or mental health organization closely linked to the regional public health institute.

== Terms and school holidays ==
In general, all schools in the Netherlands observe a summer holiday, and several weeks of one or two-week holidays during the year. Also schools are closed during public holidays. Academic terms only exist at the tertiary education level. Institutions are free to divide their year, but it is most commonly organized into four quadmesters.

The summer holiday lasts six weeks in elementary school, and starts and ends in different weeks for the northern, middle and southern regions of the country to prevent the national population from all going on vacation simultaneously. For the six-week summer holidays of all high schools, the same system applies. Universities have longer holidays (about two months, but this may include re-examinations) and usually start the year in late August or early September. The summer holiday is followed by a one-week autumn holiday in the second half of October at all levels except for most research universities. At elementary and high school levels, the week depends on the north/middle/south division also used around the summer holidays. There is a two-week Christmas holiday that includes New Year&#x27;s in the second half of December, and a one-week spring holiday in the second half of February (around Carnival). The last school holiday of the year is a one- or two-week May holiday around 27 April (Kings Day); sometimes including Ascension Day. Easter does not have a week of holiday, schools are only closed on Good Friday and Easter Monday. The summer holiday dates are compulsory, the other dates are government recommendations and can be changed by each school, as long as the right number of weeks is observed.

The Dutch educational system divides children in educational levels around the age of 12. In the last year of primary school, a test, most commonly the &quot;Cito Eindtoets Basisonderwijs&quot;, is taken to help choose the appropriate level of secondary education/school type. Although the ensuing recommendation is not binding, it does have great influence on the decision making process. Unless caretakers identify the need, in most cases an IQ test is not given to a child, which may result in some children who for various secondary reasons do not function well at school, but who do have the academic ability to learn at the higher levels, mistakenly being sent to the lower levels of education. Within a few years these children can fall far behind in development compared to their peers who were sent to the higher levels.

It is possible for students to move up (or down) from one level to another level. If there is doubt early on about the level chosen, an orientation year may be offered. However, moving up a level later on may require a lot of extra effort, motivation and time resulting in some students not reaching their full potential.

Research has shown that 30% of gifted children are (mistakenly) advised to attend the VMBO, the lower level to which 60% of twelve-year-olds are initially sent. In this particular group of children there is a higher than normal percentage of drop-outs (leaving school without any diploma).

Although IQ testing may aid to reduce mistakes in choosing levels, research has also shown that IQ is not fixed at the age of 12 and may still improve with exposure to the proper educational stimuli, which the current Dutch system by design (early separation into levels) may fail to provide.

Another area of concern is that although parents have the right to have their voice heard in the school&#x27;s decision making process, not all parents make use of this right equally, resulting in unequal opportunities for children.

A recent study by the University of Groningen has also shown strong correlation between lower parental income and advice given to students to follow lower education.

The Programme for International Student Assessment has found that the Netherlands&#x27; educational standing compared to other nations has been declining since 2006, and is now only slightly above average. School inspectors are warning that reading standards among primary school children are lower than 20 years ago, and the Netherlands has now dropped down the international rankings. A similar trend is seen in arithmetic, maths and science.

<text>Progeria is a specific type of progeroid syndrome, also known as Hutchinson–Gilford syndrome or Hutchinson–Gilford progeroid syndrome (HGPS). A single gene mutation is responsible for causing progeria. The affected gene, known as lamin A (&quot;LMNA&quot;), makes a protein necessary for holding the cell nucleus together. When this gene mutates, an abnormal form of lamin A protein called progerin is produced. Progeroid syndromes are a group of diseases that cause individuals to age faster than usual, leading to them appearing older than they actually are. People born with progeria typically live until their mid- to late-teens or early twenties. Severe cardiovascular complications usually develop by puberty, later on resulting in death.

==Signs and symptoms==

Most children with progeria appear normal at birth and during early infancy. Children with progeria usually develop the first symptoms during their first few months of life. The earliest symptoms may include a failure to thrive and a localized scleroderma-like skin condition. As a child ages past infancy, additional conditions become apparent, usually around 18–24 months. Limited growth, full-body alopecia (hair loss), and a distinctive appearance (a small face with a shallow, recessed jaw and a pinched nose) are all characteristics of progeria.

Signs and symptoms of this progressive disease tend to become more marked as the child ages. Later, the condition causes wrinkled skin, kidney failure, loss of eyesight, and atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular problems. Scleroderma, a hardening and tightening of the skin on trunk and extremities of the body, is prevalent. People diagnosed with this disorder usually have small, fragile bodies, like those of older adults. The head is usually large relative to the body, with a narrow, wrinkled face and a beak nose. Prominent scalp veins are noticeable (made more obvious by alopecia), as well as prominent eyes. Musculoskeletal degeneration causes loss of body fat and muscle, stiff joints, hip dislocations, and other symptoms generally absent in the non-elderly population. Individuals usually retain typical mental and motor function.

==Pathophysiology==
Hutchinson-Gilford progeroid syndrome (HGPS) is an extremely rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder in which symptoms resembling aspects of aging are manifested at an early age. Its occurrence is usually the result of a sporadic germline mutation; although HGPS is genetically dominant, people rarely live long enough to have children, preventing them from passing the disorder on in a hereditary manner.

HGPS is caused by mutations that weaken the structure of the cell nucleus, making normal cell division difficult. The histone mark H4K20me3 is involved and caused by &quot;de novo&quot; mutations that occur in a gene that encodes lamin A. Lamin A is made but is not processed properly. This poor processing creates an abnormal nuclear morphology and disorganized heterochromatin. Patients also do not have appropriate DNA repair, and they also have increased genomic instability.

In normal conditions, the &quot;LMNA&quot; gene codes for a structural protein called prelamin A, which undergoes a series of processing steps before attaining its final form, called lamin A. Prelamin A contains a &quot;CAAX&quot; where C is a cysteine, A an aliphatic amino acid, and X any amino acid. This motif at the carboxyl-termini of proteins triggers three sequential enzymatic modifications. First, protein farnesyltransferase catalyzes the addition of a farnesyl moiety to the cysteine. Second, an endoprotease that recognizes the farnesylated protein catalyzes the peptide bond&#x27;s cleavage between the cysteine and -aaX. In the third step, isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase catalyzes methylation of the carboxyl-terminal farnesyl cysteine. The farnesylated and methylated protein is transported through a nuclear pore to the interior of the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the protein is cleaved by a protease called zinc metallopeptidase STE24 (ZMPSTE24), which removes the last 15 amino acids, which includes the farnesylated cysteine. After cleavage by the protease, prelamin A is referred to as lamin A. In most mammalian cells, lamin A, along with lamin B1, lamin B2, and lamin C, makes up the nuclear lamina, which provides shape and stability to the inner nuclear envelope.

Before the late 20th century, research on progeria yielded very little information about the syndrome. In 2003, the cause of progeria was discovered to be a point mutation in position 1824 of the &quot;LMNA&quot; gene, which replaces a cytosine with thymine. This mutation creates a 5&#x27; cryptic splice site within exon 11, resulting in a shorter than normal mRNA transcript. When this shorter mRNA is translated into protein, it produces an abnormal variant of the prelamin A protein, referred to as progerin. Progerin&#x27;s farnesyl group cannot be removed because the ZMPSTE24 cleavage site is lacking from progerin, so the abnormal protein is permanently attached to the nuclear rim. One result is that the nuclear lamina does not provide the nuclear envelope with enough structural support, causing it to take on an abnormal shape. Since the support that the nuclear lamina normally provides is necessary for the organizing of chromatin during mitosis, weakening of the nuclear lamina limits the ability of the cell to divide. However, defective cell division is unlikely to be the main defect leading to progeria, particularly because children develop normally without any signs of disease until about one year of age. Farnesylated prelamin A variants also lead to defective DNA repair, which may play a role in the development of progeria. Progerin expression also leads to defects in the establishment of fibroblast cell polarity, which is also seen in physiological aging.

To date, over 1,400 SNPs in the &quot;LMNA&quot; gene are known. They can manifest as changes in mRNA, splicing, or protein amino acid sequence (e.g. Arg471Cys, Arg482Gln, Arg527Leu, Arg527Cys, and Ala529Val). Progerin may also play a role in normal human aging, since its production is activated in typical senescent cells. Unlike other &quot;accelerated aging diseases&quot;, such as Werner syndrome, Cockayne syndrome, or xeroderma pigmentosum, progeria may not be directly caused by defective DNA repair. These diseases each cause changes in a few specific aspects of aging but never in every aspect at once, so they are often called &quot;segmental progerias&quot;.

A 2003 report in &quot;Nature&quot; said that progeria may be a de novo dominant trait. It develops during cell division in a newly conceived zygote or in the gametes of one of the parents. It is caused by mutations in the &quot;LMNA&quot; (lamin A protein) gene on chromosome 1; the mutated form of lamin A is commonly known as progerin. One of the authors, Leslie Gordon, was a physician who did not know anything about progeria until her own son, Sam, was diagnosed at 22 months. Gordon and her husband, pediatrician Scott Berns, founded the Progeria Research Foundation.

A subset of progeria patients with heterozygous mutations of &quot;LMNA&quot; have presented an atypical form of the condition, with initial symptoms not developing until late childhood or early adolescence. These patients have had longer lifespans than those with typical-onset progeria. This atypical form is extremely rare, with presentations of the condition varying between patients with even the same mutation. The general phenotype of atypical cases is consistent with typical progeria, but other factors (severity, onset, and lifespan) vary in presentation.

===Lamin A===

Lamin A is a major component of a protein scaffold on the inner edge of the nucleus called the nuclear lamina that helps organize nuclear processes such as RNA and DNA synthesis.

Prelamin A contains a CAAX box at the C-terminus of the protein (where C is a cysteine and A is any aliphatic amino acids). This ensures that the cysteine is farnesylated and allows prelamin A to bind membranes, specifically the nuclear membrane. After prelamin A has been localized to the cell nuclear membrane, the C-terminal amino acids, including the farnesylated cysteine, are cleaved off by a specific protease. The resulting protein, now lamin A, is no longer membrane-bound and carries out functions inside the nucleus.

In HGPS, the recognition site that the enzyme requires for cleavage of prelamin A to lamin A is mutated. Lamin A cannot be produced, and prelamin A builds up on the nuclear membrane, causing a characteristic nuclear blebbing. This results in the symptoms of progeria, although the relationship between the misshapen nucleus and the symptoms is not known.

A study that compared HGPS patient cells with the skin cells from young and elderly normal human subjects found similar defects in the HGPS and elderly cells, including down-regulation of certain nuclear proteins, increased DNA damage, and demethylation of histone, leading to reduced heterochromatin. Nematodes over their lifespan show progressive lamin changes comparable to HGPS in all cells but neurons and gametes. These studies suggest that lamin A defects are associated with normal aging.

=== Mitochondria ===
The presence of progerin also leads to the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria within the cell. These mitochondria are characterized by a swollen morphology, caused by a condensation of mtDNA and TFAM into the mitochondria, which is driven by a severe mitochondrial dysfunction (low mitochondrial membrane potential, low ATP production, low respiration capacity and high ROS production). Therefore, contributing substantially to the senescence phenotype. Although, the explanation for this defective-mitochondria accumulation in progeria is about to be elucidated, it has been proposed that low PGC1-α expression (important for mitochondrial biogenesis, maintenance and function) along with low LAMP2 protein level and lysosome number (both important for mitophagy: the degradation of defective mitochondria pathway), could be implicated.

==Diagnosis==
Skin changes, abnormal growth, and loss of hair occur. These symptoms normally start appearing by one year of age. A genetic test for LMNA mutations can confirm the diagnosis of progeria. Prior to the advent of the genetic test, misdiagnosis was common.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Other syndromes with similar symptoms (non-laminopathy progeroid syndromes) include:
* Acrogeria
* Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy (congenital generalized lipodystrophy)
* Cockayne syndrome
* Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, progeroid form
* Gerodermia osteodysplastica
* Hallermann-Streiff syndrome
* Mandibuloacral dysplasia
* Neonatal progeroid syndrome (Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome)
* Nestor-Guillermo syndrome
* Penttinen syndrome
* Petty-Laxova-Weidemann progeroid syndrome
* POLR3A-related Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome
* PYCR1-related Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch-like syndrome
* Werner syndrome

==Treatment==
In November 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved lonafarnib, which helps prevent buildup of defective progerin and similar proteins. A clinical trial in 2018 points to significantly lower mortality rates – treatment with lonafarnib alone compared with no treatment (3.7% vs. 33.3%) – at a median post-trial follow-up time span of 2.2 years. The drug, given orphan drug status and Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher, is taken twice daily in the form of capsules and may cost US$650,000 per year, making it prohibitive for the vast majority of families. It is unclear how it will be covered by health insurance in the United States. Common side effects of the drug include &quot;nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, infections, decreased appetite, and fatigue&quot;.

Other treatment options have focused on reducing complications (such as cardiovascular disease) with coronary artery bypass surgery and low-dose acetylsalicylic acid. Growth hormone treatment has been attempted. The use of Morpholinos has also been attempted in mice and cell cultures in order to reduce progerin production. Antisense Morpholino oligonucleotides specifically directed against the mutated exon 11–exon 12 junction in the mutated pre-mRNAs were used.

A type of anticancer drug, the farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs), has been proposed, but their use has been mostly limited to animal models. A Phase II clinical trial using the FTI lonafarnib began in May 2007. In studies on the cells another anti-cancer drug, rapamycin, caused removal of progerin from the nuclear membrane through autophagy. It has been proved that pravastatin and zoledronate are effective drugs when it comes to the blocking of farnesyl group production.

Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) are drugs that inhibit the activity of an enzyme needed to make a link between progerin proteins and farnesyl groups. This link generates the permanent attachment of the progerin to the nuclear rim. In progeria, cellular damage can occur because that attachment occurs, and the nucleus is not in a normal state. Lonafarnib is an FTI, which means it can avoid this link, so progerin can not remain attached to the nucleus rim, and it now has a more normal state.

Studies of sirolimus, an mTOR Inhibitor, demonstrate that it can minimize the phenotypic effects of progeria fibroblasts. Other observed consequences of its use are abolishing nuclear blebbing, degradation of progerin in affected cells, and reducing insoluble progerin aggregates formation. These results have been observed only &quot;in vitro&quot; and are not the results of any clinical trial, although it is believed that the treatment might benefit HGPS patients.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that the CRM1 protein (a key component of the nuclear export machinery in mammalian) is upregulated in HGPS cells, which drives to the abnormal localization of NES containing proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Moreover, the inhibition of CRM1 in HGPS alleviates the associated-senescence phenotype as well as the mitochondrial function (an important determinant in senescence) and lysosome content. These results are under &quot;in vivo&quot; validation with selinexor (a more suitable CRM1 inhibitor for human use).

==Prognosis==
As there is no known cure, life expectancy of people with progeria is 15 years, as of 2024. At least 90 percent of patients die from complications of atherosclerosis, such as heart attack or stroke.

Mental development is not adversely affected; in fact, intelligence tends to be average to above average. With respect to the features of aging that progeria appears to manifest, the development of symptoms is comparable to aging at a rate eight to ten times faster than normal. With respect to those that progeria does not exhibit, patients show no neurodegeneration or cancer predisposition. They also do not develop conditions that are commonly associated with accumulation of damage, such as cataracts (caused by UV exposure) and osteoarthritis.

Although there may not be any successful treatments for progeria itself, there are treatments for the problems it causes, such as arthritic, respiratory, and cardiovascular problems, and recent medicinal breakthroughs enabled one patient to live until age 28. People with progeria have normal reproductive development, and there are known cases of women with progeria who delivered healthy offspring.

==Epidemiology==
A study from the Netherlands has shown an incidence of 1 in 20 million births. According to the Progeria Research Foundation, as of September 2020, there are 179 known cases in the world, in 53 countries; 18 of the cases were identified in the United States. Hundreds of cases have been reported in medical history since 1886. However, the Progeria Research Foundation believes there may be as many as 150 undiagnosed cases worldwide.

There have been only two cases in which a healthy person was known to carry the LMNA mutation that causes progeria. One family from India had four of six children with progeria.

==Research==
===Mouse model===
A mouse model of progeria exists, though in the mouse, the LMNA prelamin A is not mutated. Instead, ZMPSTE24, the specific protease that is required to remove the C-terminus of prelamin A, is missing. Both cases result in the buildup of farnesylated prelamin A on the nuclear membrane and in the characteristic nuclear LMNA blebbing.

In 2020, BASE editing was used in a mouse model to target the LMNA gene mutation that causes the progerin protein instead of the healthy Lamin A while in 2023 a study designed a peptide that prevented progerin from binding to BubR1 which is known to regulate aging in mice.

===DNA repair===

Repair of DNA double-strand breaks can occur by either of two processes, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). A-type lamins promote genetic stability by maintaining levels of proteins that have key roles in NHEJ and HR. Mouse cells deficient for maturation of prelamin A show increased DNA damage and chromosome aberrations and have increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. In progeria, the inability to adequately repair DNA damages due to defective A-type lamin may cause aspects of premature aging (also see DNA damage theory of aging).

===Epigenetic clock analysis of human HGPS===
Fibroblast samples from children with progeria syndrome exhibit accelerated epigenetic aging effects according to the epigenetic clock for skin and blood samples.

== History ==
Progeria was first described in 1886 by Jonathan Hutchinson. It was also described independently in 1897 by Hastings Gilford. The condition was later named Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome. Scientists are interested in progeria partly because it might reveal clues about the normal process of aging.

===Etymology===
The word &quot;progeria&quot; comes from the Greek words (πρό) &#x27;before, premature&#x27;, and (γῆρας), &#x27;old age&#x27;.

==Society and culture==
===Notable cases===
Yan Hui, a student of Confucius, aged rapidly and died at a young age, appearing as an old man by his late 20s. He may be one of the earliest potential examples of progeria in history. In 1987, fifteen-year-old Mickey Hays, who had progeria, appeared along with Jack Elam in the documentary &quot;I Am Not a Freak&quot;. Elam and Hays first met during the filming of the 1986 film &quot;The Aurora Encounter&quot;, in which Hays was cast as an alien. The friendship that developed lasted until Hays died in 1992, on his 20th birthday. Elam said, &quot;You know I&#x27;ve met a lot of people, but I&#x27;ve never met anybody that got next to me like Mickey.&quot;

Harold Kushner, who among other things wrote the book &quot;When Bad Things Happen to Good People&quot;, had a son, Aaron, who died at the age of 14 in 1977 of progeria. Margaret Casey, a 29-year-old woman with progeria who was then believed to be the oldest survivor of the premature aging disease, died on Sunday, May 26, 1985. Casey, a freelance artist, was admitted to Yale-New Haven Hospital on the night of May 25 with respiratory problems, which caused her death. Sam Berns was an American activist with the disease. He was the subject of the HBO documentary &quot;Life According to Sam&quot;. Berns also gave a TEDx talk titled &quot;My Philosophy for a Happy Life&quot; on December 13, 2013.

Hayley Okines was an English progeria patient who spread awareness of the condition. Leon Botha, the South African painter and DJ who was known, among other things, for his work with the hip-hop duo Die Antwoord, lived with progeria. He died in 2011, aged 26. Tiffany Wedekind of Columbus, Ohio, is believed to be the oldest survivor of progeria at 44 years old as of September 2022. Alexandra Peraut is a Catalan girl with progeria; she has inspired the book &quot;Una nena entre vint milions&quot; (&#x27;A girl in 20 million&#x27;), a children&#x27;s book to explain progeria to youngsters. Adalia Rose Williams, born December 10, 2006, was an American girl with progeria, who was a notable YouTuber and vlogger who shared her everyday life on social media. She died on January 12, 2022, at the age of 15.

Amy Foose, born September 12, 1969, was an American girl with progeria, who died at the age of 16 on December 19, 1985. Sister of American automobile designer, artist, and TV star, Chip Foose, who started a foundation in her name called Amy&#x27;s Depot. The Progeria Research Foundation gives out The Amy Award every few years, in honor of Amy. 

Sammy Basso, born December 1, 1995, was an Italian biologist, activist and writer who studied progeria and campaigned to raise awareness of the disease, died at the age of 28 on October 5, 2024. At the time of his death he was the longest-living survivor of the condition.

<text>The Salem witch trials were a series of hearings and prosecutions of people accused of witchcraft in colonial Massachusetts between February 1692 and May 1693. More than 200 people were accused. Thirty people were found guilty, nineteen of whom were executed by hanging (fourteen women and five men). One other man, Giles Corey, died under torture after refusing to enter a plea, and at least five people died in the disease-ridden jails.

Arrests were made in numerous towns beyond Salem Village (known today as Danvers) and its regional center Salem Town, notably in Andover and Topsfield. The grand juries and trials for this capital crime were conducted by a Court of Oyer and Terminer in 1692 and by a Superior Court of Judicature in 1693, both held in Salem Town, where the hangings also took place. It was the deadliest witch hunt in the history of colonial North America. Fourteen other women and two men were executed in Massachusetts and Connecticut during the 17th century. The Salem witch trials only came to an end when serious doubts began to arise among leading clergymen about the validity of the spectral evidence that had been used to justify so many of the convictions, and due to the sheer number of those accused, &quot;including several prominent citizens of the colony&quot;.

In the years after the trials, &quot;several of the accusers – mostly teen-age girls – admitted that they had fabricated their charges.&quot; In 1702, &quot;the General Court of Massachusetts declared the trials unlawful&quot;, and in 1711 the Massachusetts legislature annulled the convictions, passing a bill &quot;mentioning 22 individuals by name&quot; and reversing their attainders.

The episode is one of colonial America&#x27;s most notorious cases of mass hysteria. It was not unique, but a colonial manifestation of the much broader phenomenon of witch trials in the early modern period, which took the lives of tens of thousands in Europe. In America, Salem&#x27;s events have been used in political rhetoric and popular literature as a vivid cautionary tale about the dangers of isolation, religious extremism, false accusations, and lapses in due process. Many historians consider the lasting effects of the trials to have been highly influential in the history of the United States. According to historian George Lincoln Burr, &quot;the Salem witchcraft was the rock on which the [New England] theocracy shattered.&quot;

At the 300th anniversary events held in 1992 to commemorate the victims of the trials, a park was dedicated in Salem and a memorial in Danvers. In 1957, an act passed by the Massachusetts legislature absolved six people, while another one, passed in 2001, absolved five other victims. As of 2004, there was still talk about exonerating or pardoning all of the victims. In 2022, the last convicted Salem witch, Elizabeth Johnson Jr., was officially exonerated, 329 years after she had been found guilty.

In January 2016, the University of Virginia announced its Gallows Hill Project team had determined the execution site in Salem, where the 19 &quot;witches&quot; had been hanged. The city dedicated the &quot;Proctor&#x27;s Ledge Memorial&quot; to the victims there in 2017.

==Background==
While witch trials had begun to fade out across much of Europe by the mid-17th century, they continued on the fringes of Europe and in the American Colonies. The events in 1692–1693 in Salem became a brief outburst of a sort of hysteria in the New World, while the practice was already waning in most of Europe.

In 1668, in &quot;Against Modern Sadducism&quot;, Joseph Glanvill claimed that he could prove the existence of witches and ghosts of the supernatural realm. Glanvill wrote about the &quot;denial of the bodily resurrection, and the [supernatural] spirits.&quot;

In his treatise, Glanvill claimed that ingenious men should believe in witches and apparitions; if they doubted the reality of spirits, they not only denied demons but also the almighty God. Glanvill wanted to prove that the supernatural could not be denied; those who did deny apparitions were considered heretics, for it also disproved their beliefs in angels. Works by men such as Glanvill and Cotton Mather tried to prove that &quot;demons were alive&quot;.

=== Accusations ===

The trials began after a few local women in Salem Village were accused of witchcraft by four young girls, Betty Parris (9), Abigail Williams (11), Ann Putnam Jr. (12), and Elizabeth Hubbard (17). The accusations centered around the concept of &quot;affliction&quot;, and the women accused of having caused physical and mental harm to the girls through witchcraft.

===Recorded witchcraft executions in New England===

The earliest recorded witchcraft execution was that of Alse Young in 1647 in Hartford, Connecticut, the start of the Connecticut Witch Trials which lasted until 1663. Historian Clarence F. Jewett included a list of other people executed in New England in his 1881 book.

===Political context===

New England had been settled by religious dissenters seeking to build a Bible-based society according to their own chosen discipline. The original 1629 Royal Charter of the Massachusetts Bay Colony was vacated in 1684, after which King James II installed Sir Edmund Andros as the governor of the Dominion of New England. Andros was ousted in 1689 after the &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot; in England replaced the Catholic James II with the Protestant co-rulers William and Mary.

Simon Bradstreet and Thomas Danforth, the colony&#x27;s last leaders under the old charter, resumed their posts as governor and deputy governor, but lacked constitutional authority to rule because the old charter had been vacated. At the same time, tensions erupted between English colonists settling in &quot;the Eastward&quot; (the present-day coast of Maine) and French-supported Wabanaki people of that territory in what came to be known as King William&#x27;s War. This was 13 years after the devastating King Philip&#x27;s War with the Wampanoag and other indigenous tribes in southern and western New England. In October 1690, Sir William Phips led an unsuccessful attack on French-held Quebec. Between 1689 and 1692, Native Americans continued to attack many English settlements along the Maine coast, leading to the abandonment of some of the settlements and resulting in a flood of refugees into areas like Essex County.

A new charter for the enlarged Province of Massachusetts Bay was given final approval in England on October 16, 1691. Increase Mather had been working on obtaining the charter for four years, with William Phips often joining him in London and helping him gain entry to Whitehall. Increase Mather had published a book on witchcraft in 1684 and his son Cotton Mather published one in 1689. Increase Mather brought out a London edition of his son&#x27;s book in 1690. Increase Mather claimed to have picked all the men to be included in the new government. News of Mather&#x27;s charter and the appointment of Phips as the new governor had reached Boston by late January, and a copy of the new charter reached Boston on February 8, 1692. Phips arrived in Boston on May 14 and was sworn in as governor two days later, along with Lieutenant Governor William Stoughton. One of the first orders of business for the new governor and council on May 27, 1692, was the formal nomination of county justices of the peace, sheriffs, and the commission of a Special Court of Oyer and Terminer to handle the large numbers of people who were &quot;thronging&quot; the jails.

===Local context===
Salem Village (present-day Danvers, Massachusetts) was known for its fractious population, which not only suffered from many internal disputes, but also had a strained relationship with Salem Town (present-day Salem). Arguments about property lines, grazing rights, and church privileges were rife, and neighbors considered the population to be &quot;quarrelsome&quot;. In 1672, the villagers had voted to hire a minister of their own, apart from Salem Town. The first two ministers, James Bayley, who served from 1673 to 1679, and George Burroughs, who served from 1680 to 1683, stayed only a few years each, departing after the congregation failed to pay their full rate. Burroughs was subsequently arrested at the height of the witchcraft hysteria and was hanged as a witch in August 1692.

Despite the ministers&#x27; rights being upheld by the General Court and the parish being admonished, each of the two ministers still chose to leave. The third minister, Deodat Lawson, who served from 1684 to 1688, stayed for a short time, leaving after the church in Salem refused to ordain him rather than over issues with the congregation. The parish disagreed about Salem Village&#x27;s choice of Samuel Parris as its first ordained minister. On June 18, 1689, the villagers agreed to hire Parris for £66 annually, &quot;one third part in money and the other two third parts in provisions&quot;, and use of the parsonage.

On October 10, 1689, however, they raised Parris&#x27; benefits, voting to grant him the deed to the parsonage and two acres (0.8 hectares) of land. This conflicted with a 1681 village resolution which stated that &quot;it shall not be lawful for the inhabitants of this village to convey the houses or lands or any other concerns belonging to the Ministry to any particular persons or person: not for any cause by vote or other ways&quot;.

Though the prior ministers&#x27; fates and the level of contention in Salem Village were valid reasons for caution in accepting the position, Rev. Parris increased the village&#x27;s divisions by delaying his acceptance. He did not seem able to settle his new parishioners&#x27; disputes: by deliberately seeking out &quot;iniquitous behavior&quot; in his congregation and making church members in good standing suffer public penance for small infractions, he contributed significantly to the tension within the village. Its bickering increased unabated. Historian Marion Starkey suggests that, in this atmosphere, serious conflict may have been inevitable.

===Religious context===

Prior to the constitutional turmoil of the 1680s, the Massachusetts government had been dominated by conservative Puritan leaders. While Puritans and the Church of England both shared a common influence in Calvinism, Puritans had opposed many of the traditions of the Church of England, including use of the Book of Common Prayer, the use of clergy vestments during services, the use of the sign of the cross at baptism, and kneeling to receive communion, all of which they believed constituted popery. King Charles I was hostile to this viewpoint, and Anglican church officials tried to repress these dissenting views during the 1620s and 1630s. Some Puritans and other religious minorities had sought refuge in the Netherlands but ultimately many made a major migration to colonial North America to establish their own society.

These immigrants, who were mostly constituted of families, established several of the earliest colonies in New England, of which the Massachusetts Bay Colony was the largest and most economically important. They intended to build a society based on their religious beliefs. Colonial leaders were elected by the freemen of the colony, those individuals who had had their religious experiences formally examined and had been admitted to one of the colony&#x27;s Puritan congregations. The colonial leadership were prominent members of their congregations and regularly consulted with the local ministers on issues facing the colony.

In the early 1640s, England erupted in civil war. The Puritan-dominated Parliamentarians emerged victorious, and the Crown was supplanted by the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell in 1653. Its failure led to restoration of the old order under Charles II. Immigration of Puritans to New England slowed significantly in these years. In Massachusetts, a successful merchant class began to develop that was less religiously motivated than the colony&#x27;s early settlers.

=== Gender context ===

A majority of people accused and convicted of witchcraft were women (about 78%). Overall, the Puritan belief and prevailing New England culture was that women were inherently sinful and more susceptible to damnation than men were. Throughout their daily lives, Puritans, especially Puritan women, actively attempted to thwart attempts by the Devil to overtake them and their souls. Indeed, Puritans held the belief that men and women were equal in the eyes of God, but not in the eyes of the Devil. Women&#x27;s souls were seen as unprotected in their so-called &quot;weak and vulnerable bodies&quot;. Several factors may explain why women were more likely to admit guilt of witchcraft than men. Historian Elizabeth Reis asserts that some likely believed they had truly given in to the Devil, and others might have believed they had done so temporarily. However, because those who confessed were reintegrated into society, some women might have confessed in order to spare their own lives.

Quarrels with neighbors often incited witchcraft allegations. One example of this is Abigail Faulkner, who was accused in 1692. Faulkner admitted she was &quot;angry at what folk said&quot;, and the Devil may have temporarily overtaken her, causing harm to her neighbors. Women who did not conform to the norms of Puritan society were more likely to be the target of an accusation, especially those who were unmarried or did not have children.

===Publicising witchcraft===
Cotton Mather, a minister of Boston&#x27;s North Church, was a prolific publisher of pamphlets, including some that expressed his belief in witchcraft. In his book &quot;Memorable Providences Relating to Witchcrafts and Possessions&quot; (1689), Mather describes his &quot;oracular observations&quot; and how &quot;stupendous witchcraft&quot; had affected the children of Boston mason John Goodwin.

Mather illustrates how the Goodwins&#x27; eldest child had been tempted by the devil and had stolen linen from the washerwoman Goody Glover. Glover, of Irish Catholic descent, was characterized as a disagreeable old woman and described by her husband as a witch; this may have been why she was accused of casting spells on the Goodwin children. After the event, four out of six Goodwin children began to have strange fits, or what some people referred to as &quot;the disease of astonishment&quot;. The manifestations attributed to the disease quickly became associated with witchcraft. Symptoms included neck and back pains, tongues being drawn from their throats, and loud random outcries; other symptoms included having no control over their bodies such as becoming limber, flapping their arms like birds, or trying to harm others as well as themselves. These symptoms fueled the craze of 1692.

==Timeline==
===Initial events===
In Salem Village in February 1692, Betty Parris (age 9) and her cousin Abigail Williams (age 11), the daughter and the niece, respectively, of Reverend Samuel Parris, began to have fits described as &quot;beyond the power of epileptic fits or natural disease to effect&quot; by John Hale, the minister of the nearby town of Beverly. The girls screamed, threw things about the room, uttered strange sounds, crawled under furniture, and themselves into peculiar positions, according to the eyewitness account of Reverend Deodat Lawson, a former minister in Salem Village.

The girls complained of being pinched and pricked with pins. A doctor, historically assumed to be William Griggs, could find no physical evidence of any ailment. Other young women in the village began to exhibit similar behaviors. When Lawson preached as a guest in the Salem Village meetinghouse, he was interrupted several times by the outbursts of the afflicted.

The first three people accused and arrested for allegedly afflicting Betty Parris, Abigail Williams, 12-year-old Ann Putnam, Jr., and Elizabeth Hubbard, were Sarah Good, Sarah Osborne, and Tituba. Some historians believe that the accusation by Ann Putnam Jr. suggests that a family feud may have been a major cause of the witch trials. At the time, a vicious rivalry was underway between the Putnam and Porter families, one which deeply polarized the people of Salem. Citizens would often have heated debates, which escalated into full-fledged fighting, based solely on their opinion of the feud. Some of the physical symptoms resembled convulsive ergot poisoning, proposed 284 years later.

Sarah Good was a destitute woman accused of witchcraft because of her reputation. At her trial, she was accused of rejecting Puritan ideals of self-control and discipline when she chose to torment and &quot;scorn [children] instead of leading them towards the path of salvation&quot;.

Sarah Osborne rarely attended church meetings. She was accused of witchcraft because the Puritans believed that Osborne had her own self-interests in mind following her remarriage to an indentured servant. The citizens of the town disapproved of her trying to control her son&#x27;s inheritance from her previous marriage.

Tituba, an enslaved South American Kalina woman from the West Indies, likely became a target because of her ethnic differences from most of the other villagers. She was accused of attracting girls like Abigail Williams and Betty Parris with stories of enchantment from &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;. These tales about sexual encounters with demons, swaying the minds of men, and fortune-telling were said to stimulate the imaginations of girls and made Tituba an obvious target of accusations.

Each of these women was a kind of outcast and exhibited many of the character traits typical of the &quot;usual suspects&quot; for witchcraft accusations; they were left to defend themselves. Brought before the local magistrates on the complaint of witchcraft, they were interrogated for several days, starting on March 1, 1692, then sent to jail.

In March, others were accused of witchcraft: Martha Corey, child Dorothy Good, and Rebecca Nurse in Salem Village, and Rachel Clinton in nearby Ipswich. Martha Corey had expressed skepticism about the credibility of the girls&#x27; accusations and thus drawn attention. The charges against her and Rebecca Nurse deeply troubled the community because Martha Corey was a full covenanted member of the Church in Salem Village, as was Rebecca Nurse in the Church in Salem Town. If such upstanding people could be witches, the townspeople thought, then anybody could be a witch, and church membership was no protection from accusation. Dorothy Good, the daughter of Sarah Good, was only four years old but was not exempted from questioning by the magistrates; her answers were construed as a confession that implicated her mother. In Ipswich, Rachel Clinton was arrested for witchcraft at the end of March on independent charges unrelated to the afflictions of the girls in Salem Village.

The initial examinations included physical exams where the accused were examined for unique markings such as moles, birth marks that were commonly believed to be associated with the Devil&#x27;s influence. It was thought that those markings represented the Devil drinking the accused women&#x27;s blood.

===Accusations and examinations before local magistrates===
When Sarah Cloyce (Nurse&#x27;s sister) and Elizabeth (Bassett) Proctor were arrested in April, they were brought before John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin at a meeting in Salem Town. The men were both local magistrates and also members of the Governor&#x27;s Council. Present for the examination were Deputy Governor Thomas Danforth, and Assistants Samuel Sewall, Samuel Appleton, James Russell and Isaac Addington. During the proceedings, objections by Elizabeth&#x27;s husband, John Proctor, resulted in his arrest that day.

Within a week, Giles Corey (Martha&#x27;s husband and a covenanted church member in Salem Town), Abigail Hobbs, Bridget Bishop, Mary Warren (a servant in the Proctor household and sometime accuser), and Deliverance Hobbs (stepmother of Abigail Hobbs), were arrested and examined. Abigail Hobbs, Mary Warren, and Deliverance Hobbs all confessed and began naming additional people as accomplices. More arrests followed: Sarah Wildes, William Hobbs (husband of Deliverance and father of Abigail), Nehemiah Abbott Jr., Mary Eastey (sister of Cloyce and Nurse), Edward Bishop Jr. and his wife Sarah Bishop, and Mary English.

On April 30, Reverend George Burroughs, Lydia Dustin, Susannah Martin, Dorcas Hoar, Sarah Morey, and Philip English (Mary&#x27;s husband) were arrested. Nehemiah Abbott Jr. was released because the accusers agreed he was not the person whose specter had afflicted them. Mary Eastey was released for a few days after her initial arrest because the accusers failed to confirm that it was she who had afflicted them; she was arrested again when the accusers reconsidered. In May, accusations continued to pour in, but some of the suspects began to evade apprehension. Multiple warrants were issued before John Willard and Elizabeth Colson were apprehended; George Jacobs Jr. and Daniel Andrews were not caught. Until this point, all the proceedings were investigative, but on May 27, 1692, William Phips ordered the establishment of a Special Court of Oyer and Terminer for Suffolk, Essex and Middlesex counties to prosecute the cases of those in jail. Warrants were issued for more people. Sarah Osborne, one of the first three persons accused, died in jail on May 10, 1692.

Warrants were issued for 36 more people, with examinations continuing to take place in Salem Village: Sarah Dustin (daughter of Lydia Dustin), Ann Sears, Bethiah Carter Sr. and her daughter Bethiah Carter Jr., George Jacobs Sr. and his granddaughter Margaret Jacobs, John Willard, Alice Parker, Ann Pudeator, Abigail Soames, George Jacobs Jr. (son of George Jacobs Sr. and father of Margaret Jacobs), Daniel Andrew, Rebecca Jacobs (wife of George Jacobs Jr. and sister of Daniel Andrew), Sarah Buckley and her daughter Mary Witheridge.Also included were Elizabeth Colson, Elizabeth Hart, Thomas Farrar Sr. Roger Toothaker, Sarah Proctor (daughter of John and Elizabeth Proctor), Sarah Bassett (sister-in-law of Elizabeth Proctor), Susannah Roots, Mary DeRich (another sister-in-law of Elizabeth Proctor), Sarah Pease, Elizabeth Cary, Martha Carrier, Elizabeth Fosdick, Wilmot Redd, Sarah Rice, Elizabeth Howe, Capt. John Alden (son of John Alden and Priscilla Mullins), William Proctor (son of John and Elizabeth Proctor), John Flood, Mary Toothaker (wife of Roger Toothaker and sister of Martha Carrier) and her daughter Margaret Toothaker, and Arthur Abbott. When the Court of Oyer and Terminer convened at the end of May, the total number of people in custody was 62.

Cotton Mather wrote to one of the judges, John Richards, a member of his congregation, on May 31, 1692, expressing his support of the prosecutions, but cautioning him:
===Formal prosecution: The Court of Oyer and Terminer===

The Court of Oyer and Terminer convened in Salem Town on June 2, 1692, with William Stoughton, the new Lieutenant Governor, as Chief Magistrate, Thomas Newton as the Crown&#x27;s Attorney prosecuting the cases, and Stephen Sewall as clerk. Bridget Bishop&#x27;s case was the first brought to the grand jury, who endorsed all the indictments against her. Bishop was described as not living a Puritan lifestyle, for she wore black clothing and odd costumes, which was against the Puritan code. When she was examined before her trial, Bishop was asked about her coat, which had been awkwardly &quot;cut or torn in two ways&quot;.

This, along with her &quot;immoral&quot; lifestyle, affirmed to the jury that Bishop was a witch. She went to trial the same day and was convicted. On June 3, the grand jury endorsed indictments against Rebecca Nurse and John Willard, but they did not go to trial immediately, for reasons which are unclear. Bishop was executed by hanging on June 10, 1692.

Immediately following this execution, the court adjourned for 20 days (until June 30) while it sought advice from New England&#x27;s most influential ministers &quot;upon the state of things as they then stood.&quot; Their collective response came back dated June 15 and composed by Cotton Mather:

Thomas Hutchinson sums the letter, &quot;The two first and the last sections of this advice took away the force of all the others, and the prosecutions went on with more vigor than before.&quot; (Reprinting the letter years later in &quot;Magnalia&quot;, Cotton Mather left out these &quot;two first and the last&quot; sections.) Major Nathaniel Saltonstall, Esq., resigned from the court on or about June 16, presumably dissatisfied with the letter and that it had not outright barred the admission of spectral evidence. According to Upham, Saltonstall deserves the credit for &quot;being the only public man of his day who had the sense or courage to condemn the proceedings, at the start.&quot; (chapt. VII) More people were accused, arrested and examined, but now in Salem Town, by former local magistrates John Hathorne, Jonathan Corwin, and Bartholomew Gedney, who had become judges of the Court of Oyer and Terminer. Suspect Roger Toothaker died in prison on June 16, 1692.

From June 30 through early July, grand juries endorsed indictments against Sarah Good, Elizabeth Howe, Susannah Martin, Elizabeth Proctor, John Proctor, Martha Carrier, Sarah Wildes and Dorcas Hoar. Sarah Good, Elizabeth Howe, Susannah Martin and Sarah Wildes, along with Rebecca Nurse, went to trial at this time, where they were found guilty. All five women were executed by hanging on July 19, 1692. In mid-July, the constable in Andover invited the afflicted girls from Salem Village to visit with his wife to try to determine who was causing her afflictions. Ann Foster, her daughter Mary Lacey Sr., and granddaughter Mary Lacey Jr. all confessed to being witches. Anthony Checkley was appointed by Governor Phips to replace Thomas Newton as the Crown&#x27;s Attorney when Newton took an appointment in New Hampshire.

In August, grand juries indicted George Burroughs, Mary Eastey, Martha Corey and George Jacobs Sr. Trial juries convicted Martha Carrier, George Jacobs Sr., George Burroughs, John Willard, Elizabeth Proctor, and John Proctor. Elizabeth Proctor was given a temporary stay of execution because she was pregnant. On August 19, 1692, Martha Carrier, George Jacobs Sr., George Burroughs, John Willard, and John Proctor were executed:

===September 1692===

In September, grand juries indicted 18 more people. The grand jury failed to indict William Proctor, who was re-arrested on new charges. On September 19, 1692, Giles Corey refused to plead at trial, and was killed by &quot;peine forte et dure&quot;, a form of torture in which the subject is pressed beneath an increasingly heavy load of stones, in an attempt to make him enter a plea. Four pleaded guilty and 11 others were tried and found guilty.

On September 20, Cotton Mather wrote to Stephen Sewall: &quot;That I may be the more capable to assist in lifting up a standard against the infernal enemy&quot;, requesting &quot;a narrative of the evidence given in at the trials of half a dozen, or if you please, a dozen, of the principal witches that have been condemned.&quot; On September 22, 1692, eight more persons were executed, &quot;After Execution Mr. Noyes turning him to the Bodies, said, what a sad thing it is to see Eight Firebrands of Hell hanging there.&quot;

Dorcas Hoar was given a temporary reprieve, with the support of several ministers, to make a confession of being a witch. Mary Bradbury, aged 77, managed to escape with the help of family and friends. Abigail Faulkner Sr. was pregnant and given a temporary reprieve (some reports from that era say that Abigail&#x27;s reprieve later became a stay of charges).

Mather quickly completed his account of the trials, &quot;Wonders of the Invisible World&quot; and it was given to Phips when he returned from the fighting in Maine in early October. Burr says both Phips&#x27; letter and Mather&#x27;s manuscript &quot;must have gone to London by the same ship&quot; in mid-October:

On October 29, Judge Sewall wrote: &quot;the Court of Oyer and Terminer count themselves thereby dismissed [...] asked whether the Court of Oyer and Terminer should sit, expressing some fear of Inconvenience by its fall, [the] Governour said it must fall&quot;. Perhaps by coincidence, Governor Phips&#x27; own wife, Lady Mary Phips, was among those who had been &quot;called out upon&quot; around this time. After Phips&#x27; order, there were no more executions.

===Superior Court of Judicature, 1693===

In January 1693, the new Superior Court of Judicature, Court of Assize and General Gaol [Jail] Delivery convened in Salem, Essex County, again headed by William Stoughton as Chief Justice, with Anthony Checkley continuing as the Attorney General, and Jonathan Elatson as Clerk of the Court. Unlike its predecessor, this court &quot;did not allow spectral evidence&quot; to be used as evidence of guilt.

The first five cases tried in January 1693 were of the five people who had been indicted but not tried in September: Sarah Buckley, Margaret Jacobs, Rebecca Jacobs, Mary Whittredge (or Witheridge) and Job Tookey. All were found not guilty. Grand juries were held for many of those remaining in jail. Charges were dismissed against many, but 16 more people were indicted and tried, three of whom were found guilty: Elizabeth Johnson Jr., Sarah Wardwell, and Mary Post.

When Stoughton wrote the warrants for the execution of these three and others remaining from the previous court, Governor Phips issued pardons, sparing their lives. In late January/early February, the Court sat again in Charlestown, Middlesex County, and held grand juries and tried five people: Sarah Cole (of Lynn), Lydia Dustin and Sarah Dustin, Mary Taylor and Mary Toothaker. All were found not guilty but were not released until they paid their jail fees. Lydia Dustin died in jail on March 10, 1693.

At the end of April, the Court convened in Boston, Suffolk County, and cleared Capt. John Alden by proclamation. It heard charges against a servant girl, Mary Watkins, for falsely accusing her mistress of witchcraft. In May, the Court convened in Ipswich, Essex County, and held a variety of grand juries. They dismissed charges against all but five people. Susannah Post, Eunice Frye, Mary Bridges Jr., Mary Barker and William Barker Jr. were all found not guilty at trial, finally putting an end to the series of trials and executions.

==Legal procedures==
===Overview===
After someone concluded that a loss, illness, or death had been caused by witchcraft, the accuser entered a complaint against the alleged witch with the local magistrates. If the complaint was deemed credible, the magistrates had the person arrested and brought in for a public examination—essentially an interrogation where the magistrates pressed the accused to confess.

If the magistrates at this local level were satisfied that the complaint was well-founded, the prisoner was handed over to be dealt with by a superior court. In 1692, the magistrates opted to wait for the arrival of the new charter and governor, who would establish a Court of Oyer and Terminer to handle these cases. The next step, at the superior court level, was to summon witnesses before a grand jury.

A person could be indicted on charges of afflicting with witchcraft, or for making an unlawful covenant with the Devil. Once indicted, the defendant went to trial, sometimes on the same day, as in the case of the first person indicted and tried on June 2, Bridget Bishop, who was executed eight days later, on June 10, 1692.

There were four execution dates, with one person executed on June 10, 1692, five executed on July 19, 1692 (Sarah Good, Rebecca Nurse, Susannah Martin, Elizabeth Howe and Sarah Wildes), another five executed on August 19, 1692 (Martha Carrier, John Willard, George Burroughs, George Jacobs Sr., and John Proctor), and eight on September 22, 1692 (Mary Eastey, Martha Corey, Ann Pudeator, Samuel Wardwell, Mary Parker, Alice Parker, Wilmot Redd and Margaret Scott).

Several others, including Elizabeth (Bassett) Proctor and Abigail Faulkner, were convicted but given temporary reprieves because they were pregnant. Five other women were convicted in 1692, but the death sentence was never carried out: Mary Bradbury (in absentia), Ann Foster (who later died in prison), Mary Lacey Sr. (Foster&#x27;s daughter), Dorcas Hoar and Abigail Hobbs.

Giles Corey, an 81-year-old farmer from the southeast end of Salem (called Salem Farms), refused to enter a plea when he came to trial in September. The judges applied an archaic form of punishment called &quot;peine forte et dure,&quot; in which stones were piled on his chest until he could no longer breathe. After two days of &quot;peine fort et dure,&quot; Corey died without entering a plea. His refusal to plead is usually explained as a way of preventing his estate from being confiscated by the Crown, but, according to historian Chadwick Hansen, much of Corey&#x27;s property had already been seized, and he had made a will in prison: &quot;His death was a protest [...] against the methods of the court&quot;. A contemporary critic of the trials, Robert Calef, wrote, &quot;Giles Corey pleaded not Guilty to his Indictment, but would not put himself upon Tryal by the Jury (they having cleared none upon Tryal) and knowing there would be the same Witnesses against him, rather chose to undergo what Death they would put him to.&quot;

As convicted witches, Rebecca Nurse and Martha Corey had been excommunicated from their churches and denied proper burials. As soon as the bodies of the accused were cut down from the trees, they were thrown into a shallow grave, and the crowd dispersed. Oral history claims that the families of the dead reclaimed their bodies after dark and buried them in unmarked graves on family property. The record books of the time do not note the deaths of any of those executed.

===Spectral evidence===
Much, but not all, of the evidence used against the accused was spectral evidence, or the testimony of the afflicted who claimed to see the apparition or the shape of the person who was allegedly afflicting them. The theological dispute that ensued about the use of this evidence was based on whether a person had to give permission to the Devil for his or her shape to be used to afflict. Opponents claimed that the Devil was able to use anyone&#x27;s shape to afflict people, but the Court contended that the Devil could not use a person&#x27;s shape without that person&#x27;s permission; therefore, when the afflicted claimed to see the apparition of a specific person, that was accepted as evidence that the accused had been complicit with the Devil.

Cotton Mather&#x27;s &quot;The Wonders of the Invisible World&quot; was written with the purpose to show how careful the court was in managing the trials. Unfortunately the work did not get released until after the trials had already ended. In his book, Mather explained how he felt spectral evidence was presumptive and that it alone was not enough to warrant a conviction. Robert Calef, a strong critic of Cotton Mather, stated in his own book titled &quot;More Wonders of the Invisible World&quot; that by confessing, an accused would not be brought to trial, such as in the cases of Tituba and Dorcas Good.

Increase Mather and other ministers sent a letter to the Court, &quot;The Return of Several Ministers Consulted&quot;, urging the magistrates not to convict on spectral evidence alone. The court later ruled that spectral evidence was inadmissible, which caused a dramatic reduction in the rate of convictions and may have hastened the end of the trials. A copy of this letter was printed in Increase Mather&#x27;s &quot;Cases of Conscience&quot;, published in 1693. The publication &quot;A Tryal of Witches&quot;, related to the 1662 Bury St Edmunds witch trial, was used by the magistrates at Salem when looking for a precedent in allowing spectral evidence. Since the jurist Sir Matthew Hale had permitted this evidence, supported by the eminent philosopher, physician and author Thomas Browne, to be used in the Bury St Edmunds witch trial and the accusations against two Lowestoft women, the colonial magistrates also accepted its validity and their trials proceeded.

===Witch cake===
According to a March 27, 1692 entry by Parris in the &quot;Records of the Salem-Village Church&quot;, a church member and close neighbor of Rev. Parris, Mary Sibley (aunt of Mary Walcott), directed John Indian, a man enslaved by Parris, to make a &quot;witch cake.&quot; This may have been a superstitious attempt to ward off evil spirits. According to an account attributed to Deodat Lawson (&quot;collected by Deodat Lawson&quot;) this happened around March 8, over a week after the first complaints had gone out and three women were arrested. Lawson&#x27;s account describes this cake &quot;a means to discover witchcraft&quot; and provides other details such as that it was made from rye meal and urine from the afflicted girls and was fed to a dog.

In the Church Records, Parris describes speaking with Sibley privately on March 25, 1692, about her &quot;grand error&quot; and accepted her &quot;sorrowful confession&quot;. After the main sermon on March 27, and the wider congregation was dismissed, Parris addressed covenanted church-members about it and admonished all the congregation against &quot;going to the Devil for help against the Devil.&quot; He stated that while &quot;calamities&quot; had begun in his own household &quot;it never brake forth to any considerable light, until diabolical means were used, by the making of a cake by my Indian man, who had his direction from this our sister, Mary Sibley.&quot; This doesn&#x27;t seem to square with Lawson&#x27;s account dating it around March 8. The first complaints were February 29 and the first arrests were March 1.
Traditionally, the allegedly afflicted girls are said to have been entertained by Parris&#x27; slave, Tituba. A variety of secondary sources, starting with Charles W. Upham in the 19th century, typically relate that a circle of the girls, with Tituba&#x27;s help, tried their hands at fortune telling. They used the white of an egg and a mirror to create a primitive crystal ball to divine the professions of their future spouses and scared one another when one supposedly saw the shape of a coffin instead. The story is drawn from John Hale&#x27;s book about the trials, but in his account, only one of the girls, not a group of them, had confessed to him afterward that she had once tried this. Hale did not mention Tituba as having any part of it, nor did he identify when the incident took place. But the record of Tituba&#x27;s pre-trial examination holds her giving an energetic confession, speaking before the court of &quot;creatures who inhabit the invisible world&quot;, and &quot;the dark rituals which bind them together in service of Satan&quot;, implicating both Good and Osborne while asserting that &quot;many other people in the colony were engaged in the devil&#x27;s conspiracy against the Bay.&quot;

Tituba&#x27;s race has often been described in later accounts as of Carib-Indian or African descent, but contemporary sources describe her only as an &quot;Indian&quot;. Research by Elaine Breslaw has suggested that Tituba may have been captured in what is now Venezuela and brought to Barbados, and so may have been an Arawak Indian. Other slightly later descriptions of her, by Gov. Thomas Hutchinson writing his history of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the 18th century, describe her as a &quot;Spanish Indian&quot;. In that day, that typically meant a Native American from the Carolinas/Georgia/Florida.

===Touch test===
The most infamous application of the belief in effluvia was the &quot;touch test&quot; used in Andover during preliminary examinations in September 1692. Parris had explicitly warned his congregation against such examinations. If the accused witch touched the victim while the victim was having a fit, and the fit stopped, observers believed that meant the accused was the person who had afflicted the victim. As several of those accused later recounted:

...we were blindfolded, and our hands were laid upon the afflicted persons, they being in their fits and falling into their fits at our coming into their presence, as they said. Some led us and laid our hands upon them, and then they said they were well and that we were guilty of afflicting them; whereupon we were all seized, as prisoners, by a warrant from the justice of the peace and forthwith carried to Salem.

The Rev. John Hale explained how this supposedly worked: &quot;the Witch by the cast of her eye sends forth a Malefick Venome into the Bewitched to cast him into a fit, and therefore the touch of the hand doth by sympathy cause that venome to return into the Body of the Witch again&quot;.

===Other evidence===
Other evidence included the confessions of the accused; testimony by a confessed witch who identified others as witches; the discovery of &quot;poppits&quot; (&quot;poppets&quot;), books of palmistry and horoscopes, or pots of ointments in the possession or home of the accused; and observation of what were called &quot;witch&#x27;s teats&quot; on the body of the accused. A witch&#x27;s teat was said to be a mole or blemish somewhere on the body that was insensitive to touch; discovery of such insensitive areas was considered &quot;de facto&quot; evidence of witchcraft.

==Primary sources and early discussion==
Puritan ministers throughout the Massachusetts Bay Colony were exceedingly interested in the trial. Several traveled to Salem in order to gather information about the trial. After witnessing the trials first-hand and gathering accounts, these ministers presented various opinions about the trial starting in 1692.

Deodat Lawson, a former minister in Salem Village, visited Salem Village in March and April 1692. The resulting publication, entitled &quot;A Brief and True Narrative of Some Remarkable Passages Relating to Sundry Persons Afflicted by Witchcraft, at Salem Village: Which happened from the Nineteenth of March, to the Fifth of April 1692&quot;, was published while the trials were ongoing and relates evidence meant to convict the accused. Simultaneous with Lawson, William Milbourne, a Baptist minister in Boston, publicly petitioned the General Assembly in early June 1692, challenging the use of spectral evidence by the Court. Milbourne had to post £200 bond (equal to £, or about US$42,000 today) or be arrested for &quot;contriving, writing and publishing the said scandalous Papers&quot;.
The most famous primary source about the trials is Cotton Mather&#x27;s &quot;Wonders of the Invisible World: Being an Account of the Tryals of Several Witches, Lately Executed in New-England&quot;, printed in October 1692. This text had a tortured path to publication. Initially conceived as a promotion of the trials and a triumphant celebration of Mather&#x27;s leadership, Mather had to rewrite the text and disclaim personal involvement as suspicion about spectral evidence started to build. Regardless, it was published in both Boston and London, with an introductory letter of endorsement by William Stoughton, the Chief Magistrate. The book included accounts of five trials, with much of the material copied directly from the court records, which were supplied to Mather by Stephen Sewall, a clerk in the court.

Cotton Mather&#x27;s father, Increase Mather, completed &quot;Cases of Conscience Concerning Evil Spirits&quot; at the same time as &quot;Wonders&quot; and published it in November 1692. This book was intended to judiciously acknowledge the growing doubts about spectral evidence, while still maintaining the accuracy of Cotton&#x27;s rewritten, whitewashed text. Like his son, Increase minimized his personal involvement, although he included the full text of his August petition to the Salem court in support of spectral evidence. Judging from the apologetic tone of &quot;Cases of Conscience&quot; that the moral panic had subsided, Thomas Brattle directly ridiculed the &quot;superstitions&quot; of Salem and Increase&#x27;s defense of his son in an open letter notable for its openly sarcastic tone.

Samuel Willard, minister of the Third Church in Boston was a onetime strong supporter of the trials and of spectral evidence but became increasingly concerned as the Mathers crushed dissent. Writing anonymously to conceal his dissent, he published a short tract entitled &quot;Some Miscellany Observations On our present Debates respecting Witchcrafts, in a Dialogue Between S. &amp; B.&quot; The authors were listed as &quot;P. E. and J. A.&quot; (Philip English and John Alden), but the work is generally attributed to Willard. In it, two characters, S (Salem) and B (Boston), discuss the way the proceedings were being conducted, with &quot;B&quot; urging caution about the use of testimony from the afflicted and the confessors, stating, &quot;whatever comes from them is to be suspected; and it is dangerous using or crediting them too far&quot;. This book lists its place of publication as Philadelphia, but it is believed to have been secretly printed in Boston.

==Aftermath and closure==
Although the last trial was held in May 1693, public response to the events continued. In the decades following the trials, survivors and family members (and their supporters) sought to establish the innocence of the individuals who were convicted and to gain compensation. In the following centuries, the descendants of those unjustly accused and condemned have sought to honor their memories. Events in Salem and Danvers in 1992 were used to commemorate the trials. In November 2001, years after the celebration of the 300th anniversary of the trials, the Massachusetts legislature passed an act exonerating all who had been convicted and naming each of the innocent, with the exception of Elizabeth Johnson, who was cleared by the Massachusetts Senate on 26 May 2022, the last conviction to be reversed, after pressure from schoolchildren who discovered the anomaly. The trials have figured in American culture and been explored in numerous works of art, literature and film.

===Reversals of attainder and compensation to the survivors===

The first indication that public calls for justice were not over occurred in 1695 when Thomas Maule, a noted Quaker, publicly criticized the handling of the trials by the Puritan leaders in Chapter 29 of his book &quot;Truth Held Forth and Maintained&quot;, expanding on Increase Mather by stating, &quot;it were better that one hundred Witches should live, than that one person be put to death for a witch, which is not a Witch&quot;. For publishing this book, Maule was imprisoned twelve months before he was tried and found not guilty.

On December 17, 1696, the General Court ruled that there would be a fast day on January 14, 1697, &quot;referring to the late Tragedy, raised among us by Satan and his Instruments.&quot; On that day, Samuel Sewall asked Rev. Samuel Willard to read aloud his apology to the congregation of Boston&#x27;s South Church, &quot;to take the Blame &amp; Shame&quot; of the &quot;late Commission of Oyer &amp; Terminer at Salem&quot;. Thomas Fiske and eleven other trial jurors also asked forgiveness.

From 1693 to 1697, Robert Calef, a &quot;weaver&quot; and a cloth merchant in Boston, collected correspondence, court records and petitions, and other accounts of the trials, and placed them, for contrast, alongside portions of Cotton Mather&#x27;s &quot;Wonders of the Invisible World&quot;, under the title &quot;More Wonders of the Invisible World&quot;,

Calef could not get it published in Boston and he had to take it to London, where it was published in 1700. Scholars of the trials—Hutchinson, Upham, Burr, and even Poole—have relied on Calef&#x27;s compilation of documents. John Hale, a minister in Beverly who was present at many of the proceedings, had completed his book, &quot;A Modest Enquiry into the Nature of Witchcraft&quot; in 1697, which was not published until 1702, after his death, and perhaps in response to Calef&#x27;s book. Expressing regret over the actions taken, Hale admitted, &quot;Such was the darkness of that day, the tortures and lamentations of the afflicted, and the power of former presidents, that we walked in the clouds, and could not see our way.&quot;

Various petitions were filed between 1700 and 1703 with the Massachusetts government, demanding that the convictions be formally reversed. Those tried and found guilty were considered dead in the eyes of the law, and with convictions still on the books, those not executed were vulnerable to further accusations. The General Court initially reversed the attainder only for those who had filed petitions, only three people who had been convicted but not executed: Abigail Faulkner Sr., Elizabeth Proctor and Sarah Wardwell. In 1703, another petition was filed, requesting a more equitable settlement for those wrongly accused, but it was not until 1709, when the General Court received a further request, that it took action on this proposal. In May 1709, 22 people who had been convicted of witchcraft, or whose relatives had been convicted of witchcraft, presented the government with a petition in which they demanded both a reversal of attainder and compensation for financial losses.

Repentance was evident within the Salem Village church. Rev. Joseph Green and the members of the church voted on February 14, 1703, after nearly two months of consideration, to reverse the excommunication of Martha Corey. On August 25, 1706, when Ann Putnam Jr., one of the most active accusers, joined the Salem Village church, she publicly asked forgiveness. She claimed that she had not acted out of malice, but had been deluded by Satan into denouncing innocent people, mentioning Rebecca Nurse, in particular, and was accepted for full membership.

On October 17, 1711, the General Court passed a bill reversing the judgment against the twenty-two people listed in the 1709 petition (there were seven additional people who had been convicted but had not signed the petition, but there was no reversal of attainder for them). Two months later, on December 17, 1711, Governor Joseph Dudley authorized monetary compensation to the 22 people in the 1709 petition. The amount of £578 12s was authorized to be divided among the survivors and relatives of those accused, and most of the accounts were settled within a year, but Phillip English&#x27;s extensive claims were not settled until 1718. Finally, on March 6, 1712, Rev. Nicholas Noyes and members of the Salem church reversed Noyes&#x27; earlier excommunications of Rebecca Nurse and Giles Corey.

===Memorials===

Rebecca Nurse&#x27;s descendants erected an obelisk-shaped granite memorial in her memory in 1885 on the grounds of the Nurse Homestead in Danvers, with an inscription from John Greenleaf Whittier. In 1892, an additional monument was erected in honor of forty neighbors who signed a petition in support of Nurse.
Not all the condemned had been exonerated in the early 18th century. In 1957, descendants of the six people who had been wrongly convicted and executed but who had not been included in the bill for a reversal of attainder in 1711, or added to it in 1712, demanded that the General Court formally clear the names of their ancestral family members. An act was passed pronouncing the innocence of those accused, although it listed only Ann Pudeator by name. The others were listed only as &quot;certain other persons&quot;, phrasing which failed specifically to name Bridget Bishop, Susannah Martin, Alice Parker, Wilmot Redd and Margaret Scott.
The 300th anniversary of the trials was marked in 1992 in Salem and Danvers by a variety of events. A memorial park was dedicated in Salem which included stone slab benches inserted in the stone wall of the park for each of those executed in 1692. Speakers at the ceremony in August included playwright Arthur Miller and Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel. Danvers erected its own new memorial, and reinterred bones unearthed in the 1950s, assumed to be those of George Jacobs Sr., in a new resting place at the Rebecca Nurse Homestead.

In 1992, The Danvers Tercentennial Committee also persuaded the Massachusetts House of Representatives to issue a resolution honoring those who had died. After extensive efforts by Paula Keene, a Salem schoolteacher, state representatives J. Michael Ruane and Paul Tirone, along with others, issued a bill whereby the names of all those not previously listed were to be added to this resolution. When it was finally signed on October 31, 2001, by Governor Jane Swift, more than 300 years later, all were finally proclaimed innocent.

===Gallows Hill and Proctor&#x27;s Ledge===
Land in the area was purchased by the city of Salem in 1936 and renamed &quot;Witch Memorial Land&quot; but no memorial was constructed on the site, and popular misconception persisted that the executions had occurred at the top of Gallows Hill. Rebecca Eames of Boxford, who was brought to Salem for questioning, stated that she was held at &quot;the house below the hill&quot; where she could see people attending executions. This helped researchers rule out the summit as the execution site. In January 2016, the University of Virginia announced its project team had determined the execution site on Gallows Hill in Salem, where nineteen &quot;witches&quot; had been hanged in public. Members of the Gallows Hill Project had worked with the city of Salem using old maps and documentation, as well as sophisticated GIS and ground-penetrating radar technology, to survey the area of what became known as Proctor&#x27;s Ledge, located at the base of the hill, which they say was easier for spectators to reach than the top of Gallows Hill. The city owns the property and dedicated the &quot;Proctor&#x27;s Ledge Memorial&quot; to the victims there in 2017. A documentary, &quot;Gallows Hill – Nineteen,&quot; is in production about these events.

==In literature, media and popular culture==

The story of the witchcraft accusations, trials and executions has captured the imagination of writers and artists in the centuries since the event took place. Their earliest impactful use as the basis for an item of popular fiction is the 1828 novel &quot;Rachel Dyer&quot; by John Neal.

Many interpretations have taken liberties with the facts of the historical episode in the name of literary and/or artistic license—including the popular but false idea that witches in America were burned. As the trials took place at the intersection between a gradually disappearing medieval past and an emerging enlightenment, and dealt with torture and confession, some interpretations draw attention to the boundaries between the medieval and the post-medieval as cultural constructions.

==Medical theories about the reported afflictions==

The cause of the symptoms of those who claimed affliction continues to be a subject of interest. Various medical and psychological explanations for the observed symptoms have been explored by researchers, including psychological hysteria in response to Indian attacks, convulsive ergotism caused by eating rye bread made from grain infected by the fungus &quot;Claviceps purpurea&quot; (a natural substance from which LSD is derived), an epidemic of bird-borne encephalitis lethargica, and sleep paralysis to explain the nocturnal attacks alleged by some of the accusers. Some modern historians are less inclined to focus on biological explanations, preferring instead to explore motivations such as jealousy, spite, and a need for attention to explain the behavior.

<doc id="205247" wikidata="Q128829" url="?curid=205247" title="Michael Owen">
<text>Michael James Owen (born 14 December 1979) is an English former professional footballer who played as a striker for Liverpool, Real Madrid, Newcastle United, Manchester United and Stoke City, as well as the England national team. Since retiring from football in 2013, he has become a racehorse breeder and owner and regularly features as a sports pundit and commentator. Owen is widely considered to be one of the greatest strikers of his generation and in Premier League history. In 2001, Owen was the recipient of the Ballon d&#x27;Or. In 2004, he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players.

The son of former footballer Terry Owen, Owen was born in Chester and began his senior career at Liverpool in 1996. Displaying rapid pace and composed finishing, he progressed through the Liverpool youth team and scored on his Premier League debut in May 1997, becoming the club&#x27;s youngest goalscorer, at . In his first full season in the Premier League, Owen finished as joint top scorer with 18 goals, sharing the Premier League Golden Boot. He repeated this the following year and was Liverpool&#x27;s top goal-scorer from 1997 to 2004, gaining his name as a proven goal-scorer despite suffering from a recurring hamstring injury. In 2001, Liverpool won a cup treble of the UEFA Cup, FA Cup (with Owen scoring two late goals in the final) and Football League Cup. He went on to score 118 goals in 216 appearances in the Premier League for Liverpool, and 158 goals in 297 total appearances.

After Liverpool had fallen behind their title rivals under Gérard Houllier&#x27;s final two seasons, Owen opted not to renew his contract and then moved to Real Madrid for £8 million in the summer of 2004. There he was frequently used as a substitute. He scored 13 goals in La Liga before returning to England the following season where he joined Newcastle United for £16.8 million. This was after Owen&#x27;s disappointment that Real had rejected a bid from Liverpool to re-sign him. After a promising start to the 2005–06 season, injuries largely ruled him out over the next 18 months. After his return, he became team captain and was the team&#x27;s top scorer for the 2007–08 season. Newcastle were relegated in the 2008–09 season and, in a surprise move, Owen moved to Manchester United as a free agent. He spent three years at Old Trafford before joining Stoke City in September 2012. Owen is one of ten players to have scored 150 or more goals in the Premier League. He is also the youngest player to have reached 100 goals in the Premier League. On 19 March 2013, Owen announced his retirement from playing at the end of the 2012–13 season.

Internationally, Owen first played for the senior England team in 1998, becoming England&#x27;s youngest player and youngest goalscorer at the time. His performance at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, which included a goal against Argentina in which he ran from the halfway line, brought him to national and international prominence, making him one of the most sought after players in world football. He went on to score in UEFA Euro 2000, the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004. He was the first player to have scored in four consecutive major tournaments for England. He played at the 2006 World Cup, but suffered an injury which took him a year to recover from. Occasionally playing as captain, he is England&#x27;s 11th-most-capped player and has scored a former national record (since overtaken by Wayne Rooney) of 26 competitive goals, with 40 in total from 89 appearances, most recently in 2008.

==Early life==
Owen was born in Chester, Cheshire, the fourth child of Jeanette and Terry Owen. His father is a former professional footballer and played for clubs such as Chester City and Everton. Owen was introduced to football at the age of seven by his father who soon saw Michael as the most promising athlete in the family. A boyhood Everton fan, Owen attended Rector Drew Primary School in Hawarden, Flintshire, Wales and by the age of ten, some of the nation&#x27;s leading scouts were monitoring his progress.

At eight, Owen was selected for the Deeside Area Primary School&#x27;s Under-11 team. At nine, he was captain and at ten he had smashed Ian Rush&#x27;s 20-year record for the same team by scoring 97 goals in a single season, improving on Rush&#x27;s record by 25 goals. Owen also broke Gary Speed&#x27;s appearance record having played in all three seasons for the 11-year-olds since he was eight. Owen turned out for the youth team of Mold Alexandra, playing with the under-10s at the age of eight after a local physical education teacher, Howard Roberts, persuaded the league to allow an under-age player. Owen scored on his debut for Mold Alexandra, a 2–0 victory over local rivals Bagillt. He went on to score 34 goals in 24 games in his first season with Mold Alexandra. After leaving Deeside, Owen attended Hawarden High School, where he also played for the school team.

==Club career==

===Liverpool===
====1991–1996: Youth career====

At age 12, when Owen started attending secondary school, he became eligible to sign a schoolboy contract with a club. The first major club to spot him playing for Deeside was Liverpool. Brian Kidd came down from Manchester United and there was also interest from Chelsea and Arsenal. But Steve Heighway, the Liverpool youth development officer, wrote to Owen personally. Terry Owen stated: &quot;[Heighway] wrote us a smashing letter and it was love at first sight for Michael, he was impressed from day one.&quot; Owen subsequently signed with the Liverpool youth team. The club then persuaded Owen to attend the FA&#x27;s School of Excellence at Lilleshall in Shropshire at age 14. Owen was soon playing for England teams from under-15 upwards, breaking several scoring records with 28 goals in 20 games for the England u-15s and u-16s. Owen also scored prolifically as he rose rapidly through the Anfield youth ranks. Throughout this time, Owen had continued his studies and achieved ten GCSEs. Despite the academic success, Owen was unshakeable, his future was a professional football career with the Liverpool youth team.

In the 1995–96 season, Owen played for Liverpool&#x27;s youth team even though he was still at Lilleshall. Most of the players were 18, but Owen was only 16. He scored a hat-trick against FA Youth Cup holders Manchester United in the quarter-finals, scoring the winner in extra time. Owen subsequently scored another hat-trick in a 4–2 win in the first leg of the semi against Crystal Palace. Liverpool were 3–0 down after only 50 minutes in the second leg, but with Owen taking control of the match and scoring twice, the team ran out as 7–5 winners. Liverpool faced West Ham United in the final, played over two legs as well. West Ham had not lost in 24 consecutive games, and had future England stars Rio Ferdinand and Frank Lampard. Owen missed the first leg at Upton Park as he was on tour duty with the England under-16 team in the European youth championship in Austria. He returned for the second-leg where Liverpool had fallen behind early against West Ham but Owen equalised with his eleventh goal in five cup matches and Liverpool won the match 2-1. It was the first time Liverpool had won the FA Youth Cup in the club&#x27;s history and Owen was widely considered the star of the FA Youth Cup campaign.

====1996–2000: Breakthrough and prolific goal-scoring====
Owen celebrated his 17th birthday by signing a professional contract with Liverpool. He was handed a place in Roy Evans&#x27; senior squad, with Steve Heighway stating that, &quot;[Owen] is ready for whatever you throw at him; nothing fazes Michael Owen. He&#x27;s ready. If the manager wants a recommendation from me, Michael gets it.&quot; Owen also declared his aim was &quot;a first-team place in the next year or so&quot;. Karl-Heinz Riedle, who prior to joining Liverpool in the summer of 1997 had never heard of Owen, declared, &quot;It&#x27;s unbelievable when you see him play to realise that he&#x27;s only 17,&quot; he said. &quot;He&#x27;s such a good player, so very quick and for his age he has excellent vision and awareness. He&#x27;s a great player already and in one or two years he will become a very great player.&quot; Owen was rated as &quot;the best attacker of his age in the country&quot; in January 1997. Ted Powell, the championship-winning coach of the England under-18 side, declared Owen to be the best of a generation of young players that included Paul Scholes, David Beckham and Robbie Fowler. On 6 May 1997, Owen scored on his Liverpool debut against Wimbledon at Selhurst Park. Liverpool were league title challengers to Manchester United but their failure to beat Wimbledon in the penultimate game of the league season handed the championship to United. The &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; wrote, &quot;[Only] Michael Owen could emerge with any credit from a performance that mocked Anfield&#x27;s rich traditions.&quot; Owen, who had come on as a substitute in the second half, &quot;[breathed] new life into the Reds&#x27; championship corpse,&quot; and &quot;began [Liverpool&#x27;s] best spell of the night&quot;, but was ultimately not able to salvage a win. The &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; stated, &quot;It was a debut marked in the grand manner.&quot;

Owen replaced the injured Robbie Fowler as Liverpool&#x27;s first choice striker in 1997–98. He won the Premier League Golden Boot and was awarded the PFA Young Player of the Year award. Owen also finished in third place in the PFA Player of the Year voting behind Dennis Bergkamp and Tony Adams. Owen recorded many personal feats during the season and helped Liverpool challenge for the league championship, but ultimately a run of bad form in February saw the club bowing out of the title race. The &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; wrote that, &quot;[Owen] has become Liverpool&#x27;s most precious performer and, quite simply, their saviour.&quot; Owen signed a five-year contract with Liverpool worth £2.5 million during the season. His £10,000-a-week deal made him the highest-paid teenager in the history of British football. Owen was runner-up to Zinedine Zidane in the World Player of the Year award, also finishing in fourth position in the FIFA World Player of the Year and European Player of the Year international awards. Owen retained the Premier League Golden Boot in 1998–99 despite incurring a hamstring injury against Leeds United that prematurely brought his season to an end on 12 April. With his pace identified as his greatest strength, Liverpool&#x27;s game had revolved around feeding him with through passes and long balls. Owen constantly moved from static positions to full speed in a matter of split seconds. ESPN wrote, &quot;It [would] eventually [prove] too much for [Owen&#x27;s] hamstring to handle. Liverpool failed to challenge for the league title that season despite Owen&#x27;s brilliant form. The club had appointed a new manager in Gérard Houllier and were transitioning out of the Spice Boys era. Owen ended the 1998–99 season as runners-up to Nicolas Anelka in the PFA Young Player of the Year award.

Owen returned to action after almost five months of layoff during the 1999–2000 season. He played intermittently throughout the season and ended up ceding the Golden Boot to Kevin Phillips. He had completed only six full games by January and, during a frustrating spell punctuated by recurring breakdowns, had managed to stay the 90 minutes only three times since mid-October. Owen injured his hamstring once again while playing against Middlesbrough in January. He remained out of action for well over a month and later received treatment from German doctor Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfahrt. The persistent hamstring problems ended up robbing Liverpool of Owen for a third of a season in which a lack of goals eventually cost them a place in the Champions League.

====2000–2002: Ballon d&#x27;Or and continental treble====
Owen helped Liverpool to a treble in 2000–01, as the team won the League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup to end a six-year trophy drought. Owen was thus the recipient of the Ballon d&#x27;Or in recognition of his performances that season. He became the most recent English winner of the European Footballer of the Year award, and the first Englishman to win the award since Kevin Keegan in 1979. Owen scored both of Liverpool&#x27;s goals in their triumph over Arsenal in the 2001 FA Cup Final as they came back from 1–0 down to win 2–1.

Liverpool and Owen challenged for the league championship during the 2001–02 season. The team eventually finished runners-up to Arsenal, with Owen playing a key part in the campaign. On 29 December 2001, Owen scored his 100th goal for Liverpool during the season against West Ham United. He also led them to success in the Charity Shield and the UEFA Super Cup during the start of the season in 2001. Liverpool thus became the first English team to win five trophies in one calendar year. Owen signed a four-year contract worth £70,000-a-week with Liverpool during the season, making him one of the highest earners in the English Premiership. Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez started as early as in March 2002 to pursue Owen. Pérez declared his intentions to make Owen the next &quot;Galáctico&quot;, stating that &quot;the best players must play for Real Madrid&quot;. Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier laughed off any apparent interest, saying, &quot;They might be able to afford Ronaldo but they cannot afford Michael Owen. For that kind of money they could only buy his left foot but he is not going anywhere. Michael is Liverpool through and through and he is staying with me.&quot;

====2002–2004: Maintained performances and transfer rumours====
Owen continued with strong performances in the 2002–03 season which saw Liverpool top the league table and remain unbeaten for several months. However, a run of disastrous results starting from November and culminating in January saw the team bow out of the title race. Chelsea pipped Liverpool to the fourth and final Champions League spot on the final day of the season. Owen was also controversially overlooked for the PFA Player of the Year award during the season. He had continued establishing personal records with Liverpool and had scored his 100th Premier League goal on 26 April against West Bromwich Albion. Success in the League Cup also meant that Liverpool had ended up with a trophy for a third consecutive season. Owen had scored in the League Cup Final against Manchester United to clinch the trophy for Liverpool. However, Liverpool&#x27;s failure to qualify for the Champions League led to speculation about Owen&#x27;s long-term future. Transfer speculation had continued linking him to Real Madrid and Barcelona. Owen was quoted as saying, &quot;I really have to be playing in the Champions League and that is something [Liverpool] have to remedy.&quot; Owen would later refute the quote, stating, &quot;Some of the words I never even said and the rest were taken completely out of context.&quot; Houllier moved to re-shape the Liverpool squad in 2003 to reassure Owen. He stated, &quot;We want to win the title. This is our vision at Liverpool – and we want to win it with Michael in our team. Michael is a genuine world-class player. He has had a great season and I think he will be even better next season.&quot; Bolton Wanderers manager Sam Allardyce was quoted as saying, &quot;Stop Michael Owen scoring and you are 50 per cent towards getting a result at Anfield,&quot; while Owen had admitted to being frustrated at the lack of support play from his teammates.

After a shaky start to the 2003–04 season, Liverpool emerged as title contenders once more, with Owen leading the charge. Owen, however, would suffer an ankle injury while playing against Arsenal on 3 October and consequently went through &quot;three months of injury nightmare&quot;. Owen only played intermittently over the following months, suffering from niggling ankle and hamstring injuries, while Liverpool&#x27;s season fell apart. After a goal drought lasting nine games and three months, Owen returned to fitness and scoring form with a goal against Manchester City on 11 February. Owen helped reignite Liverpool&#x27;s hunt for fourth spot, scoring his 150th goal for Liverpool in the subsequent match against Portsmouth on 15 February, and although suffering from further injuries, ultimately led Liverpool to the fourth and final Champions League spot. Following Gérard Houllier&#x27;s sacking as Liverpool manager, speculation about Owen&#x27;s departure from the club began. During the first few Champions League games at the start of the 2004–05 season, Owen sat on the bench to avoid being cup-tied for the Champions League, something that would have meant he would be unable to play in European competitions for any other club that season. Since 1998, Owen had been Liverpool&#x27;s top scorer every season until he left the club. Real Madrid signed him for a fee of £8 million on 13 August 2004, with midfielder Antonio Núñez moving in the other direction as a make-weight.

===Real Madrid===

Following their successful bid, on 14 August 2004, Real Madrid officially presented Owen with the number 11 shirt. Owen joined the club during its &quot;Galácticos&quot; era, and played alongside the &quot;big four&quot; of preceding star signings, namely Luís Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, and David Beckham, as well as prominent team players from the pre-Galácticos era; Raúl, Roberto Carlos, and Iker Casillas. He also became the second Liverpool player to join Real Madrid in five years after Steve McManaman, who played for the club from 1999 to 2003.

Owen was regarded as having a slow start to his Madrid career, often being confined to the bench. Owen sometimes drew criticism from fans and the Spanish press for his lack of form. A successful return to action with the England squad in October 2004 seemed to revive his morale however, and in the first following match, he scored his first goal for the club, the winner in a 1–0 Champions League victory over Dynamo Kyiv. A few days later, he scored his first La Liga goal in a 1–0 victory over Valencia. The scoring spree continued, as he found the back of the net in three of the next four matches to make it five goals in seven matches. On 10 April 2005, Owen scored Real Madrid&#x27;s fourth goal in a 4–2 &quot;El Clásico&quot; win over Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. Owen ended the 2004–05 season with 13 goals in La Liga, with the season&#x27;s highest ratio of goals scored to number of minutes played. Following Madrid&#x27;s signing of two high-profile Brazilian forwards, Robinho and Júlio Baptista, in the summer of 2005, the speculation arose that Owen would return to the Premier League. During his time at Real Madrid, Owen scored 16 goals from 45 games, 26 of which were starts.

===Newcastle United===
====2005–2007: Club record transfer and injuries====
On 24 August 2005, Newcastle United announced that they had agreed to a club record fee of £16.8 million to obtain Owen, although they still had to negotiate with the player&#x27;s advisers. Liverpool and local rivals Everton entered the fray, but were unwilling to match Madrid&#x27;s asking price. As the 2006 World Cup was less than a year away, Owen wanted to get more playing time to secure his position as the first-choice striker in the England squad and joined Newcastle amid rumours that he had inserted an escape clause valued at £12 million. On 31 August 2005, Owen signed a four-year contract to play for Newcastle, despite initial press speculation that he would rather have returned to Liverpool. Some 20,000 fans were present at Newcastle&#x27;s home ground of St James&#x27; Park for Owen&#x27;s official unveiling as a Newcastle player. Several days after signing, he suffered a thigh-injury in pre-season, which ruled him out for the start of the 2005–06 season. He scored his first goal for the club on his second appearance, the second goal in a 3–0 away win at Blackburn Rovers on 18 September, Newcastle&#x27;s first win of the season. Owen scored his first hat-trick for Newcastle in the 4–2 away win over West Ham United on 17 December. It was also a &quot;perfect hat trick&quot;, with one goal scored with each of his left foot, right foot and head.

On 31 December 2005, Owen broke a metatarsal bone in his foot in a match against Tottenham Hotspur. He underwent surgery to place a pin in the bone, to help speed the healing process. He was expected to be out of action until late March, but the healing process did not go as hoped and on 24 March he underwent a second, minor operation. Owen then stated that he should be fit for the final few weeks of the season with Newcastle. His return to action finally came against Birmingham City on 29 April when he came off the substitutes&#x27; bench in the 62nd minute. After the match, Owen stated that he was &quot;not 100% happy&quot; with his foot. He underwent a further X-ray and made himself unavailable for Newcastle&#x27;s final game of the season. A damaged anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his right knee, sustained in the first minute of the group match against Sweden at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, kept Owen out of regular football for nearly a year, until April 2007. The seriousness of Owen&#x27;s injury at the World Cup inflamed the so-called &quot;club-versus-country&quot; row in England, centring on the liability of the world governing body FIFA and The Football Association (FA) for the cost of injuries to players incurred while on international duty. Newcastle were aggrieved at the length of time Owen would now be out of action in forthcoming Premier League and Cup competitions as a result of the World Cup injury, particularly as he had been out for the half-season prior to the World Cup. Under the existing insurance arrangements between club and country, FIFA and the FA had been paying £50,000 of Owen&#x27;s £110,000 weekly wages since he suffered the injury, totalling approximately £2 million for the time he was out of action. By September 2006, Newcastle were threatening to sue the FA for further compensation, for a reported figure of £20 million. The Owen case was a high-profile follow-up to an already ongoing legal claim for compensation from FIFA over an injury incurred by Abdelmajid Oulmers on international duty. Newcastle&#x27;s compensation claim included the £10 million cost of buying Owen&#x27;s replacement, Obafemi Martins, £6.2 million towards Owen&#x27;s salary costs while injured, the possibility of long-term damage to Owen&#x27;s fitness and ability, the loss of league position and cup competition progress, depreciation of Owen&#x27;s four-year contract, and the cost of medical treatment for Owen. In February 2007, FIFA made Newcastle a &quot;final offer&quot; of £1 million. By April 2007, Newcastle were threatening to take out an injunction to stop the FA from picking Owen for England games. The club finally reached a compromise settlement figure with FIFA and the FA; FIFA indicated that the settlement was between £6 million and £7 million. The club, stating that Owen&#x27;s wages had &quot;now been paid in full&quot;, stated the overall compensation achieved totalled £10 million. Resulting from the Owen compensation claim, the FA doubled their future insurance coverage of England players to £100,000, and FIFA introduced a compensation fund for injuries sustained at World Cups.
Owen began light training on 12 February 2007, when pictures on the club&#x27;s official website highlighted Owen running and carrying out minor exercises. He made his comeback from injury on 10 April 2007 in a 4–1 behind-closed-doors friendly against Gretna, scoring after ten minutes and then setting up fellow striker Shola Ameobi before coming off an hour later. Owen then started his first game for Newcastle in over a year, a 1–0 loss against Reading on 30 April 2007. He played the full 90 minutes, having a goal disallowed for offside.
Owen was stretchered off an hour into Newcastle&#x27;s game with Watford on 13 May 2007, suffering concussion after colliding with teammate Matty Pattison. On 9 May 2007, Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd reacted angrily to reports that Owen could move on to another club at the end of the 2006–07 season due to a release clause in his contract. A report in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper suggested Owen could be available for less than £10 million and could be a target for the likes of Chelsea, Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal. Despite these reports, Shepherd warned Owen &quot;to show some loyalty&quot; and warned him that &quot;none of the big four clubs want him&quot;. In a video posted on YouTube, however, a group of Liverpool fans asked Shepherd if they could re-sign Owen, he responded by saying that he would &quot;carry Owen back to Liverpool&quot; himself. Shepherd also stated his dislike of Owen&#x27;s agent but praised Owen as a &quot;good lad&quot;. This led many to believe that Owen would exercise his right to leave if the £9 million valuation was matched. On 10 June 2007, Owen&#x27;s new manager at Newcastle, Sam Allardyce, confirmed the existence of the release clause in Owen&#x27;s contract and said he feared that the club would be powerless to prevent Owen from leaving. On 12 July 2007, however, Owen committed his immediate future to Newcastle, stating, &quot;I believe that these can be good times to be at Newcastle, which is why I am more than happy to be here.&quot;

====2007–2009: Declined form and injuries====
On 17 July 2007, he scored for Newcastle in a pre-season friendly against Hartlepool United. Several days later, Owen picked up a thigh injury in training. Newcastle manager Sam Allardyce said that Owen was likely to miss the start of the forthcoming Premier League season due to the injury which &quot;doesn&#x27;t look as encouraging as we first thought&quot;. Owen made his comeback from injury in a club friendly on 13 August 2007 and declared himself available for Newcastle&#x27;s next match, against Aston Villa, as well as England&#x27;s forthcoming international matches. On 29 August 2007, Owen scored his first competitive goal for Newcastle since December 2005 when he scored in the League Cup against Barnsley. Three days later, he scored in the league with a late winner against Wigan Athletic. In late September 2007, after an encouraging start to the season playing for both Newcastle and England, it was reported that he would urgently require an operation for a double hernia and would likely be out of action for at least a month. In his first match back from the hernia operation, he scored a late goal coming off the substitutes bench to clinch victory for Newcastle over Everton. In November 2007, Owen suffered a thigh strain while on international duty, ruling him out for six weeks. This reignited the &quot;club or country&quot; row, with then Newcastle manager Sam Allardyce voicing his disappointment that Owen was risked in a low-key friendly game against Austria. After over three months without a goal, Owen scored the first goal of the second Kevin Keegan era in a 4–1 FA Cup third round replay win over Stoke City on 16 January 2008, although Keegan was only a spectator in the stands for this game. Owen was awarded the captaincy by Keegan on 19 January 2008. He scored his first league goal of 2008 on 3 February. Owen&#x27;s goal in the 2–0 defeat of Fulham on 22 March 2008, which marked Newcastle&#x27;s first win under Keegan&#x27;s second spell as manager, also marked the first time in his Newcastle career that Owen had scored more goals for Newcastle than against them. By 5 April 2008, after his and the team&#x27;s early season poor form, Owen had scored six goals in the previous six matches, with Newcastle registering four wins and two draws, lifting Newcastle into mid-table after earlier relegation fears. In the final game of the season, Owen scored in a 3–1 loss at Everton, finishing with 11 goals in total, putting him in equal 13th position for Premier League goals for the 2007–08 season.

Owen missed all of the pre-season matches and training of the 2008–09 season due to a bout of mumps, which also kept him out of the international friendlies with the USA and Trinidad and Tobago in May 2008. He also suffered a calf strain during the summer months which kept him out of the opening game of the season against Manchester United at Old Trafford, a game which Newcastle drew 1–1. He made his return in the second game of the season against Bolton Wanderers on 23 August 2008, coming on in the 53rd minute for the injured Obafemi Martins. He scored the winning header in the 71st minute, with the game finishing 1–0. Three days later, he was named on the bench in a League Cup match away to Coventry City, he came on as a substitute and scored the winner in extra time in a 2–3 victory. In the 2008–09 season, he featured more consistently than in prior seasons, scoring four goals in twelve league appearances. Under the transfer rules, with the 2008–09 season being the final year of his contract with Newcastle, Owen would have been allowed to sign a pre-contract agreement with other clubs during January. On 22 December 2008, Owen rejected a new contract offer from Newcastle, but stated that he would not be seeking a move in the January transfer window and instead intended to postpone talks over his contract situation until the end of the season. With speculation over his future continuing in the second half of the season, Owen received &quot;substantial damages&quot; in June in the High Court in London and a public apology following a story on 15 May in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; alleging that due to a lack of interest from Premier League clubs, Owen&#x27;s career was effectively finished and he intended to retire.

After a disastrous season in general for the club, which culminated in Owen&#x27;s former Newcastle and England teammate Alan Shearer being brought in as a temporary manager for the final eight games of the season. Michael&#x27;s alleged refusal to play in this run including a crucial home against Fulham ( proved costly, as on the final day of the season on 24 May 2009, Newcastle were relegated from the Premier League for the first time in 15 years. On 14 June, it was reported that Owen&#x27;s management company Wasserman Media Group had sent out a 34-page brochure advertising Owen to several potential clubs. On 22 June, Owen confirmed he would not be re-signing for Newcastle, in preference for a move to a Premier League club, or another top-flight foreign club. It was reported that Owen would not begin negotiations with any other club until after 30 June when, on expiry of his contract, he would become eligible for a free transfer. In September 2019, Owen stated that he regretted his move to Newcastle and that he had hoped for a return to Liverpool.

===Manchester United===

====2009–2010: Impressive debut season====

On 3 July 2009, it was announced that Owen had signed a two-year deal with Manchester United, arch rivals of Liverpool. A surprise move, Owen said that the approach from manager Alex Ferguson was &quot;out of the blue&quot;. He signed a pay-as-you-play deal and was handed the number 7 shirt vacated by the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid. The shirt had previously been worn by many of United&#x27;s other illustrious players over the years, including Johnny Berry, George Best, Steve Coppell, Bryan Robson, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.

Owen scored his first goal for United on his debut, scoring an 84th-minute winner after coming on as a substitute in a pre-season friendly against a Malaysian XI; he followed this up by scoring three more goals in United&#x27;s pre-season games. Owen made his league debut for United when he came on as a substitute against Birmingham City on 16 August in a 1–0 win, and scored his first competitive goal in a Manchester United shirt against Wigan Athletic on 22 August in a 5–0 away win. On 20 September, Owen scored his first goal at Old Trafford, in the sixth minute of stoppage time against local rivals Manchester City to give United a 4–3 derby win. This meant that Owen had now scored in his third derby, after scoring in the Merseyside derby, and the Tyne–Wear derby in previous years. Owen struggled to recall the moments immediately after the goal, and said that it ranked as one of his most important. On 27 October, Owen scored a goal in the 2–0 away win against Barnsley to qualify United past the fourth round of the League Cup. On 3 November, Owen scored his first Champions League goal for Manchester United, as he grabbed United&#x27;s first in the 3–3 draw against CSKA Moscow. Owen&#x27;s seemingly slim chances of earning a place in Fabio Capello&#x27;s England squad for the 2010 World Cup finals in 2010 received a boost when on 8 December 2009, Owen scored his first hat-trick for Manchester United in a 3–1 away win against VfL Wolfsburg in the Champions League, his first hat-trick since 2005. On 28 February 2010, Owen scored United&#x27;s first goal in their 2–1 victory over Aston Villa in the 2010 League Cup final, but had to be substituted after pulling up on 42 minutes. Originally thought to be a minor injury, on 5 March it was announced Owen required surgery on his hamstring, ruling him out for the rest of the season.

====2010–2011: Premier League title====

Owen scored his first goal for United back from injury in a 7–1 pre-season victory against a League of Ireland XI on 4 August 2010 at the newly built Aviva Stadium. On 22 September 2010, Owen scored twice during a 5–2 away win over Scunthorpe United in the third round of the League Cup, his first goals of the season. Four days later, Owen scored his first league goal of the season, United&#x27;s second equaliser with his first touch in a 2–2 away draw against Bolton Wanderers. Owen&#x27;s first goal of 2011 came in United&#x27;s 2–1 FA Cup victory over Southampton at St Mary&#x27;s Stadium on 29 January. On 25 February, United manager Alex Ferguson said that Owen was a key part of his squad for the rest of the season. However, he suffered a groin injury and missed his team&#x27;s next four games. His return match was on 19 March when he returned to the bench for United&#x27;s game against Bolton.

By the time of United&#x27;s penultimate game of the season, he had reached the number of league appearances required for a title winner&#x27;s medal – his first in 15 seasons as a professional. The game, on 14 May 2011, only required United to draw with Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park to win the title, and a 1–1 draw secured it for them. Owen was an unused substitute in the game. Owen scored United&#x27;s final goal in their last league game of the season, at home to Blackpool, in which the &quot;Red Devils&quot; won 4–2. Owen was an unused substitute in United&#x27;s Champions League final defeat to Barcelona, marking the end of his season. He signed a one-year extension to his contract on 1 June 2011.

====2011–2012: Limited appearances====

Owen started his first game of the season in the third round of the League Cup against Leeds United. He scored two goals in the first half, helping United to progress to the fourth round with a 3–0 win. His first goal came after he advanced to the box and scuffed a shot into the corner of the net. The second goal came on the half-hour mark, when he met Mame Biram Diouf&#x27;s cross with instant control, before firing a right foot shot into the top. Owen started his second game of the season in the fourth round of the League Cup, against League Two club Aldershot Town. He scored the second goal of the 3–0 win. Dimitar Berbatov completed a run down the right flank before pulling the ball back into the box, with Owen scoring past Ross Worner.

Owen started in United&#x27;s home Champions League group stage match against Oțelul Galați on 2 November, however he was substituted early in the first half when he pulled up with a thigh injury; this was his last appearance for the team. In February 2012, Owen started light training with the Manchester United squad. From April 2012, Owen started full training but was not yet ready for first team games. On 13 May 2012, Owen was named as a substitute against Sunderland in United&#x27;s final fixture, but he was not brought on. On 17 May 2012, Owen announced on Twitter that Manchester United would not be offering him a new deal, ending his three-year association with the club.

===Stoke City===

On 4 September 2012, Owen joined Stoke City on a one-year contract. He was handed the number 10 shirt from the departed Ricardo Fuller and made his debut in a 1–1 draw against Manchester City on 15 September. The start to his time at Stoke was hampered by a hamstring injury. Owen scored his first and only goal for Stoke on 19 January 2013 in a 3–1 defeat at Swansea City, his first goal since 25 October 2011. In doing so, he became only the seventh player to reach 150 Premier League goals.

On 19 March 2013, Owen announced that he would retire from playing at the end of the 2012–13 season. He was restricted to just eight Premier League appearances for Stoke, all coming from the substitutes&#x27; bench, including in his final appearance on 19 May 2013 against Southampton, where he received a standing ovation from both sets of supporters.

==International career==
Owen was capped 89 times for England and scored 40 goals. He is sixth in the list of all-time top scorers for the England team, behind Harry Kane (61), Wayne Rooney (53), Bobby Charlton (49), Gary Lineker (48) and Jimmy Greaves (44). His 89 caps also place him as England&#x27;s eleventh most capped player.

Owen played for England at the 1998, 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups and the 2000 and 2004 UEFA European Championships. He scored goals in all but one of these tournaments, making him the only player ever to have scored in four major tournaments for England.

===Emergence===
Owen had a highly successful record at Youth level, playing for the England under-20 team at the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship and scoring three goals in four games. He played once for the England under-21 team, scoring in a win over Greece at Carrow Road.

He made his debut for the England senior team in a 2–0 friendly loss to Chile on 11 February 1998. This made Owen the youngest player to represent England in the 20th century at 18 years and 59 days of age.

Owen&#x27;s youthful enthusiasm, pace and talent made him a popular player across the country, and many fans were keen for him to be selected for the 1998 World Cup in France. In a pre-World Cup friendly against Morocco, Owen scored his first goal for England. The goal also made him the youngest ever player to have scored for England, until his record was surpassed by Wayne Rooney in 2003.

===1998 World Cup===

Owen was selected for the World Cup squad by manager Glenn Hoddle, becoming England&#x27;s youngest ever player at a World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the opening match against Tunisia. In the following match, a 2–1 defeat to Romania, Owen again appeared as a substitute. His equalising goal made him England&#x27;s youngest ever goalscorer in the tournament at the age of 18 years and 190 days. In stoppage time, he hit the post with a long range shot, almost salvaging a point from the game. Because of his impact against Romania, Hoddle selected Owen in the starting line-up for England&#x27;s decisive group match against Colombia. England won the match and Owen retained his place for the second round match against Argentina. After Argentina had taken a sixth-minute lead, Owen was fouled in the penalty area by Roberto Ayala and Alan Shearer equalised with the penalty kick. In the 16th minute, Owen gave England a 2–1 lead with a sensational individual goal. After beating defenders Ayala and José Chamot, he struck the ball past goalkeeper Carlos Roa from just outside the penalty box. In 2013, the goal was voted as the third-greatest in England&#x27;s history. England eventually drew the match and went out of the tournament on penalties, with Owen successfully converting his kick. At the end of the year, he won a public vote to be elected winner of the prestigious BBC Sports Personality of the Year title.

===Euro 2000===
Owen started the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying phase as a regular in the England starting line-up. However, injury problems meant he missed much of the campaign as England struggled, with Hoddle being replaced by Kevin Keegan. On 4 September 1999, he scored his first goal at Wembley Stadium in a 6–0 win over Luxembourg. At the finals, Owen scored once in three matches, as England were knocked out at the group stage, after losing again to Romania.

===2002 World Cup===
After Alan Shearer&#x27;s retirement, Owen took over as England&#x27;s senior striker under new manager Sven-Göran Eriksson. He scored six times during 2002 World Cup qualifying, including a hat-trick against Germany at Munich&#x27;s Olympiastadion, as England won the qualifying group. His performances saw him named European Footballer of the Year for 2001.
In April 2002, he was named as England&#x27;s captain for a friendly match against Paraguay in place of the injured regular captain David Beckham. Owen was the youngest England captain since Bobby Moore in 1963, and in the following few seasons regularly deputised for Beckham as Eriksson&#x27;s vice-captain.

At the 2002 World Cup finals, Owen failed to score during the group stage. However, he was fouled for England&#x27;s match winning penalty kick in the 1–0 win over Argentina. Owen scored in England&#x27;s second round match against Denmark and then gave England an early lead in the 2–1 quarter-final defeat against Brazil.

===Euro 2004===
Owen scored five times in qualification for Euro 2004.

At the tournament proper, Owen again failed to score during the group stage. He then scored in the third minute of the quarter-final with Portugal, becoming the first England player to score in four consecutive major tournaments. England went on to lose on penalties after a 2–2 draw.

===2006 World Cup===

In qualification for the 2006 World Cup, Owen scored five goals.

In May 2005, he scored his second international hat-trick in a friendly match against Colombia at Giants Stadium. In another pre-World Cup friendly, Owen scored two late goals to give England a 3–2 win over rivals Argentina in November 2005.

Owen made his debut for the England B-team in a friendly against Belarus on 25 May 2006, as part of his return to match fitness ahead of the 2006 World Cup. He captained England B in this game, playing for 61 minutes before being substituted.

Owen started England&#x27;s first two games of the 2006 World Cup, against Paraguay and Trinidad and Tobago, but did not manage to score. After playing only 51 seconds of his third appearance of the tournament, and 80th cap, in the final group game against Sweden, Owen badly twisted his right knee and was forced to leave the match on a stretcher. A scan of the injury on 21 June confirmed that Owen had torn the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his knee, and was sent home, no longer able to play in the tournament. In March 2009, Owen admitted that all injuries he was sustaining were relating back to his injury in the 2006 World Cup tournament, and that he should not have returned prematurely from injury to participate in the competition.

===Final appearances===
Owen underwent successful reconstruction surgery, carried out by Richard Steadman, on 6 September 2006. The injury sidelined him until April 2007, meaning he missed England&#x27;s first six matches in qualifying for Euro 2008. He returned for the England B game against Albania, and was named in the full squad for the first England match at the new Wembley Stadium against Brazil and the Euro 2008 qualifier against Estonia, with Owen stating &quot;I feel sharp and, if given the chance, I feel confident when in front of goal.&quot; He played in both matches and scored against Estonia, breaking Gary Lineker&#x27;s record for most goals in competitive internationals for England.

On 12 September 2007, Owen scored twice for England in a 3–0 win over Russia, becoming the first player to score international goals at both the old and new Wembley Stadiums. These were to be Owen&#x27;s final goals for England.

After England failed to qualify for Euro 2008, manager Steve McClaren was replaced by Fabio Capello. Owen made only one appearance under Capello, as a substitute in a friendly against France in March 2008.

==Style of play==
In his prime, Owen was highly regarded for his great pace, opportunism and agility, as well as his technical ability and his eye for goal, which enabled him to be considered one of the greatest English and Premier League strikers of his generation. A prolific goalscorer, Owen was a powerful and accurate finisher, who was also effective with his head, despite his lack of height. He was also capable of linking up with and creating chances for teammates due to his short passing ability and vision. Despite, or even due to, his precocious talent in his youth, Owen faced many injuries throughout his career, which in later years affected his pace, fitness, mobility and the overall consistency of his performances.

==Personal life==
Owen met Louise Bonsall at primary school in 1984. The couple bought Lower Soughton Manor near Mold, Flintshire, North Wales, where they keep his cars and her horses. They were engaged on 14 February 2004, and married on 24 June 2005, at the Carden Park Hotel in Chester, Cheshire. The couple had initially planned to get married at their home, but changed plans when they were informed that if a licence was granted for a marriage ceremony the venue must be made available for other weddings for three years, so opted to marry in a register office in informal clothing and have a lavish reception the next day in the grounds of their home.

Their daughter, Gemma Rose, was born on 1 May 2003. On 6 February 2006, they had a son named James Michael. Their third child, a daughter, Emily May, was born on 29 October 2007. Their fourth child Jessica was born on 26 February 2010.

After Owen returned to the UK to play for Newcastle, he travelled to a nearby BAE Systems facility on a daily basis in order to fly, by helicopter, to train with his club. However, there is now a helipad installed within the grounds of the house to accommodate Owen&#x27;s Eurocopter Dauphin, with which he both travels and is training to become a pilot. Owen was eventually banned from training to be a pilot by Newcastle United due to excessive insurance premiums.

Owen bought multiple houses on one street for his extended family in Ewloe, which is in an area close to where he used to live.

In 2004, Owen&#x27;s sister Karen was assaulted by two youths, who attempted to kidnap her. When she revealed that she was pregnant, they fled.

Owen owns several cars and a helicopter and enjoys horse racing and gambling. He owns many race horses, trained by Tom Dascombe. He bred the horse Brown Panther which won a major race at Royal Ascot in 2011, and the 2015 Dubai Gold Cup. Owen was a brand ambassador for British bookmaker Colossus Bets.

On 24 November 2017, Owen rode on Calder Prince at Ascot and finished second, beaten by Tom Chatfield-Roberts on Golden Wedding. He was one of 10 amateur riders to take part in the seven-furlong &#x27;Prince&#x27;s Countryside Fund Charity&#x27; contest, which was attended by HRH Prince Charles and HRH Duchess of Cornwall.

Owen starred in a series of adverts that charted his life and rise to fame. In 2001, he was the advertising face of breakfast cereal &quot;Nestlé Sporties&quot;. He also appeared in several adverts for the washing powder Persil, in a contract worth £1 million. Owen was selected as one of the two cover athletes for &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 2008&quot;. He has been an ambassador of the Swiss watchmaker Tissot since 1998 and has a contract with car manufacturer Jaguar.

Owen also starred as himself in the children&#x27;s television drama show &quot;Hero to Zero&quot;. In the programme, Owen would emerge from a full-size poster of himself in Charlie Brice&#x27;s room to offer advice in times of crisis.

Owen had indicated that he would like to become involved with Chester in some capacity when he retires, as it was his local team growing up and his father played for the old Chester side which went out of business in March 2010 and was reformed at a lower level.

In January 2018, Owen participated in &quot;And They&#x27;re Off!&quot; in aid of Sport Relief, winning the episode.

In January 2022, Owen appeared on the third series of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Doughnuts&quot;. He was the seventh to be unmasked.

In May 2022, cryptocasino Punt announced Owen as their most recent global brand ambassador. Following this, in June 2022 Owen was found to have breached UK laws regarding gambling advertising, as he had used his Twitter account to promote an unlicenced cryptocurrency casino to the British public. He was instructed by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) to delete the promotions for the non-fungible token scheme, which breached rules about advertising cryptocurrency gambling products.

In June 2022, his oldest daughter Gemma, 19, took part in series 8 of ITV reality show &quot;Love Island&quot; where she finished in second place.

In a BBC interview in January 2024, Owen revealed that his son James had been diagnosed with Stargardt disease, a degenerative eye condition, when he was eight years old.

<text>Count Andrey Ivanovich Ostermann (, ; 9 June 1686 31 May 1747) was a German-born Russian statesman who came to prominence under Tsar Peter I of Russia () and served until the accession of the Tsesarevna Elizabeth in 1741. He based his foreign policy on the Austrian alliance. General Admiral (1740; dismissed 1741).

==Early career==
Born in Bochum in Westphalia, to a middle-class Lutheran pastor, his original name was Heinrich Johann Friedrich Ostermann. He studied languages at the University of Jena, learning German, Latin, French, Dutch, Italian, and Russian. Ostermann became secretary to Vice-Admiral Cornelis Kruse, who had a standing commission from Peter the Great to pick up promising young men, and soon thereafter entered the tsar&#x27;s service. The young man&#x27;s knowledge of the principal European languages made him the right hand of Vice-Chancellor Shafirov, whom he materially assisted during the troublesome negotiations which terminated in the peace of the Pruth (1711). Ostermann, together with General Bruce, represented Russia at the Åland peace congress of 1718. Shrewdly guessing that Sweden was at exhaustion point, and that Heinrich von Görtz, the Swedish plenipotentiary, was acting &quot;ultra vires&quot;, he advised Peter to put additional pressure on Sweden to force a peace.

==Diplomacy==
In 1721, Ostermann concluded the Peace of Nystad with Sweden, and was created a baron for his services. In 1723, he was made vice-president of the ministry of foreign affairs for bringing about a very advantageous commercial treaty with Persia. Peter also constantly consulted him in domestic affairs, and he introduced many administrative novelties, e.g. &quot;the Table of Ranks,&quot; and the reconstruction of the College of Foreign Affairs on more modern lines.

During the reign of Catherine I of Russia (1725–1727) Osterman&#x27;s authority still further increased. The conduct of foreign affairs was left entirely in his hands, and he held also the posts of minister of commerce and postmaster-general. On the accession of Peter II of Russia Ostermann was appointed governor to the young emperor, and on his death (1730) he refused to participate in the attempt of Demetrius Galitzne and the Dolgorukovs to convert Russia into a limited constitutional monarchy. He held aloof till the empress Anne was firmly established on the throne as autocrat. Then he got his reward. His unique knowledge of foreign affairs made him indispensable to the empress and her counsellors, and even as to home affairs his advice was almost invariably followed. It was at his suggestion that the cabinet system was introduced into Russia.

All the useful reforms introduced between 1730 and 1740 are to be attributed to his initiative. He improved the state of trade, lowered taxation, encouraged industry and promoted education, ameliorated the judicature and materially raised the credit of Russia. As foreign minister he was cautious and circumspect, but when war was necessary he prosecuted it vigorously and left nothing to chance. The successful conclusions of the War of the Polish Succession (1733–1735) and of the Russo-Turkish War (1735–1739) were entirely due to his diplomacy.

==Vice-chancellor of all Russia==
During the brief regency of Anna Leopoldovna (October 1740-December 1741) Ostermann stood at the height of his power, and the French ambassador, Marquis de La Chetardie, reported to his court that &quot;it is not too much to say that he is tsar of all Russia&quot; Ostermann&#x27;s foreign policy was based upon the Austrian alliance. He had, therefore, guaranteed the Pragmatic Sanction with the deliberate intention of defending it. Hence the determination of France to remove him at any cost. Russia, as the natural ally of Austria, was very obnoxious to France; indeed it was only the accident of the Russian alliance which, in 1741, seemed to stand between Maria Theresa of Austria and absolute ruin. The most obvious method of rendering the Russian alliance unserviceable to the queen of Hungary was by implicating Russia in hostilities with her ancient rival, Sweden, and this was brought about, by French influence and French money, when in August 1741 the Swedish government, on the most frivolous pretexts, declared war against Russia. The dispositions previously made by Ostermann enabled him, however, to counter the blow, and all danger from Sweden was over when, early in September, Field-Marshal Lacy routed the Swedish general von Wrangel under the walls of the frontier-fortress of Willmanstrand, which was carried by assault.

==Downfall==
It now became evident to La Chetardie that only a revolution would overthrow Osterman, and this he proposed to promote by elevating to the throne the tsesarevna Elizabeth, who hated the vice-chancellor because, though he owed everything to her father, he had systematically neglected her. Ostermann was therefore the first and the most illustrious victim of the coup d&#x27;état of 6 December 1741. Accused, among other things, of contributing to the elevation of the empress Anne by his cabals and of suppressing a supposed will of Catherine I made in favour of her daughter Elizabeth of Russia, he threw himself on the clemency of the new empress. He was condemned first to be broken on the wheel and then beheaded; but, reprieved on the scaffold, his sentence was commuted to lifelong banishment, with his whole family, to Beryozov in Siberia, where he died six years later, in 1747.

Ostermann&#x27;s children returned to the court during the reign of Catherine the Great. His elder son, count Feodor Andreevich (1723–1804), was the senator and governor of Moscow (1773). Another son, Ivan Andreevich (1725–1811), was the Russian ambassador in Stockholm and then, for 16 years, the Chancellor of the Russian Empire (1781–97). After his death the Ostermann titles and estates passed to his nephew, Alexander Ivanovich Tolstoy, chancellor of the Russian military orders.

<text>Gandhinagar (, ) is the capital of the state of Gujarat in India. Gandhinagar is located approximately 23 km north of Ahmedabad, on the west central point of the industrial corridor between the megacities of Delhi and Mumbai.

Gandhinagar lies on the west bank of the Sabarmati River, about 545 km (338 miles) north of Mumbai and 901 km (560 miles) southwest of Delhi. 
The Akshardham temple is located in Gandhinagar. There was a determination to make Gandhinagar a purely Indian enterprise, partly because the state of Gujarat was the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi. For this reason, the planning was done by two Indian town planners: Prakash M Apte and H. K. Mewada, who had apprenticed with Le Corbusier in Chandigarh.

==Etymology==
The name of the city means &quot;Gandhi&#x27;s city&quot; and it is named after Mahatma Gandhi.

==History==
The city was planned by Chief Architect H.K. Mewada, a Cornell University graduate, and his assistant Prakash M Apte. It was developed in the 1960s.

==Demographics==
 census of India, Gandhinagar had a population of 208,299. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Gandhinagar has an average literacy rate of 90%. Male literacy is 91%, and female literacy is 89%. In Gandhinagar, 11% of the population is under 6 years of age. Over 95% of the population of Gandhinagar are Hindus.

==Geography==

Gandhinagar has an average elevation of . The city sits on the banks of the Sabarmati River, in north-central-east Gujarat. The 20,543 km2 area around Gandhinagar is defined by Gujarat capital territory. Gandhinagar spans an area of . The river frequently dries up in the summer, leaving only a small stream of water. Gandhinagar is India&#x27;s tree capital with 54% green cover on its land area.

==Climate==
Gandhinagar has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;) with three main seasons: summer, monsoon and winter. The climate is generally dry and hot outside of the monsoon season. The weather is hot to severely hot from March to May when the maximum temperature stays in the range of , and the minimum in the range of . It is pleasant in the winter days and quite chilling in the night during December to February. The average maximum temperature is around , the average minimum is , and the climate is extremely dry. The southwest monsoon brings a humid climate from mid-June to mid-September. The average annual rainfall is around .
==Governance and politics==


On 1 May 1960, Gujarat was created out of the 17 northern districts of the former State of Bombay. These districts were further subdivided later on. There are 33 administrative districts in the state. Gandhinagar is a political hub for the state of Gujarat.

Congress won the first municipal election in 2011. Mahendrasinh Rana became the first mayor of the city. The current Member of the Lok Sabha for Gandhinagar is Amit Shah from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Gandhinagar is also situated near the west command post of the Indian Army and Indian Air force and also has a command centre in the city.

Gandhinagar has recently developed the Gujarat State Emergency Disaster Management centre.

==Transport==
===Air===
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport located in Ahmedabad is 18 km away from Gandhinagar, providing both domestic and international flights.

===Rail===
Gandhinagar Capital railway station (GNC) is located in Sector 14. Many trains running on the western zones pass through Gandhinagar. Currently, there are five trains running from this station in which three are express trains and two are MEMU trains. Jaipur-Bandra Garib Rath, Haridwar mail for Delhi and Haridwar and Shanti Express for Indore Junction BG are main express trains running through this station.

Ahmedabad Railway Station (ADI) in Kalupur Ahmedabad is the nearest rail junction (25 km away) which provides connectivity with all the major cities and towns of India. The Indian Railways transports are available for moving in northern India and eastern India from Kalol Junction railway station (KLL).

====Metro====
Under Phase II of the Ahmedabad Metro, total 22.8 km long network connecting Gandhinagar with Ahmedabad is being constructed. The north–south line of the Ahmedabad Metro is being extended from Motera station to Mahatma Mandir station. A branch line will connect GNLU station to GIFT City station.

<doc id="205264" wikidata="Q11180" url="?curid=205264" title="Internal medicine">
<text>Internal medicine, also known as general medicine in Commonwealth nations, is a medical specialty for medical doctors focused on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases in adults. Its namesake stems from &quot;treatment of diseases of the internal organs&quot;. Medical practitioners of internal medicine are referred to as internists, or physicians in Commonwealth nations. Internists possess specialized skills in managing patients with undifferentiated or multi-system disease processes. They provide care to both hospitalized (inpatient) and ambulatory (outpatient) patients and often contribute significantly to teaching and research. Internists are qualified physicians who have undergone postgraduate training in internal medicine, and should not be confused with &quot;interns&quot;, a term commonly used for a medical doctor who has obtained a medical degree but does not yet have a license to practice medicine unsupervised.

In the United States and Commonwealth nations, there is often confusion between internal medicine and family medicine, with people mistakenly considering them equivalent.

Internists primarily work in hospitals, as their patients are frequently seriously ill or require extensive medical tests. Internists often have subspecialty interests in diseases affecting particular organs or organ systems. The certification process and available subspecialties may vary across different countries.

Additionally, internal medicine is recognized as a specialty within clinical pharmacy and veterinary medicine.

== Etymology and historical development ==
The term &quot;internal medicine&quot; in English has its etymology in the 19th-century German term &quot;&quot;. Originally, internal medicine focused on determining the underlying &quot;internal&quot; or pathological causes of symptoms and syndromes through a combination of medical tests and bedside clinical examination of patients. It emphasized treatment of the diseases affecting the internal organs of the body. This approach differed from earlier generations of physicians, such as the 17th-century English physician Thomas Sydenham, known as the father of English medicine or &quot;the English Hippocrates.&quot; Sydenham developed the field of nosology (the study of diseases) through a clinical approach that involved diagnosing and managing diseases based on careful bedside observation of the natural history of disease and their treatment. Sydenham emphasized understanding the internal mechanisms and causes of symptoms rather than dissecting cadavers and scrutinizing the internal workings of the body.

In the 17th century, there was a shift towards anatomical pathology and laboratory studies, and Giovanni Battista Morgagni, an Italian anatomist of the 18th century, is considered the father of anatomical pathology. Laboratory investigations gained increasing significance, with contributions from physicians like German physician and bacteriologist Robert Koch in the 19th century. During this time, internal medicine emerged as a field that integrated the clinical approach with the use of investigations. Many American physicians of the early 20th century studied medicine in Germany and introduced this medical field to the United States, adopting the name &quot;internal medicine&quot; in imitation of the existing German term.

Internal medicine has historical roots in ancient India and ancient China. The earliest texts about internal medicine can be found in the Ayurvedic anthologies of Charaka.

== Role of internal medicine specialists ==
Internal medicine specialists, also referred to as general internal medicine specialists or general medicine physicians in Commonwealth countries, are specialized physicians trained to manage complex or multisystem disease conditions that single-organ specialists may not be equipped to handle. They are often called upon to address undifferentiated presentations that do not fit neatly within the scope of a single-organ specialty, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, weight loss, chest pain, confusion, or alterations in conscious state. They may manage serious acute illnesses that affect multiple organ systems concurrently within a single patient, as well as the management of multiple chronic diseases in a single patient.

While many internal medicine physicians choose to subspecialize in specific organ systems, general internal medicine specialists do not necessarily possess any lesser expertise than single-organ specialists. Rather, they are specifically trained to care for patients with multiple simultaneous problems or complex comorbidities.

Due to the complexity involved in explaining the treatment of diseases that are not localized to a single organ, there has been some confusion surrounding the meaning of internal medicine and the role of an &quot;internist&quot;. Although internists may serve as primary care physicians, they are not synonymous with &quot;family physicians&quot;, &quot;family practitioners&quot;, &quot;general practitioners&quot;, or &quot;GPs&quot;. The training of internists is solely focused on adults and does not typically include surgery, obstetrics, or pediatrics. According to the American College of Physicians, internists are defined as &quot;physicians who specialize in the prevention, detection, and treatment of illnesses in adults.&quot; While there may be some overlap in the patient population served by both internal medicine and family medicine physicians, internists primarily focus on adult care with an emphasis on diagnosis, whereas family medicine incorporates a holistic approach to care for the entire family unit. Internists also receive substantial training in various recognized subspecialties within the field and are experienced in both inpatient and outpatient settings. On the other hand, family medicine physicians receive education covering a wide range of conditions and typically train in an outpatient setting with less exposure to hospital settings. The historical roots of internal medicine can be traced back to the incorporation of scientific principles into medical practice in the 1800s, while family medicine emerged as part of the primary care movement in the 1960s.

==Education and training==

The training and career pathways for internists vary considerably across different countries.

Many programs require previous undergraduate education prior to medical school admission. This &quot;pre-medical&quot; education is typically four or five years in length. Graduate medical education programs vary in length by country. Medical education programs are tertiary-level courses, undertaken at a medical school attached to a university. In the US, medical school consists of four years. Hence, gaining a basic medical education may typically take eight years, depending on jurisdiction and university.

Following completion of entry-level training, newly graduated medical practitioners are often required to undertake a period of supervised practice before their licensure, or &quot;registration&quot;, is granted, typically one or two years. This period may be referred to as &quot;internship&quot;, &quot;conditional registration&quot;, or &quot;foundation programme&quot;. Then, doctors may follow specialty training in internal medicine if they wish, typically being selected to training programs through competition. In North America, this period of postgraduate training is referred to as residency training, followed by an optional fellowship if the internist decides to train in a subspecialty.

In most countries, residency training for internal medicine lasts three years and centers on secondary and tertiary levels of health care, as opposed to primary health care. In Commonwealth countries, trainees are often called senior house officers for four years after the completion of their medical degree (foundation and core years). After this period, they are able to advance to registrar grade when they undergo a compulsory subspecialty training (including acute internal medicine or a dual subspecialty including internal medicine). This latter stage of training is achieved through competition rather than just by yearly progress as the first years of postgraduate training.

==Certification==
In the US, three organizations are responsible for the certification of trained internists (i.e., doctors who have completed an accredited residency training program) in terms of their knowledge, skills, and attitudes that are essential for patient care: the American Board of Internal Medicine, the American Osteopathic Board of Internal Medicine and the Board of Certification in Internal Medicine. In the UK, the General Medical Council oversees licensing and certification of internal medicine physicians. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians confers fellowship to internists (and sub-specialists) in Australia. The Medical Council of Canada oversees licensing of internists in Canada.

=== Subspecialties ===
==== United States of America ====
In the US, two organizations are responsible for certification of subspecialists within the field: the American Board of Internal Medicine and the American Osteopathic Board of Internal Medicine. Physicians (not only internists) who successfully pass board exams receive &quot;board certified&quot; status.

In the United Kingdom, the three medical Royal Colleges (the Royal College of Physicians of London, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow) are responsible for setting curricula and training programmes through the Joint Royal Colleges Postgraduate Training Board (JRCPTB), although the process is monitored and accredited by the independent General Medical Council (which also maintains the specialist register).

Doctors who have completed medical school spend two years in foundation training completing a basic postgraduate curriculum. After two years of Core Medical Training (CT1/CT2), or three years of Internal Medicine Training (IMT1/IMT2/IMT3) as of 2019, since and attaining the Membership of the Royal College of Physicians, physicians commit to one of the medical specialties: 
* Acute internal medicine (with possible subspecialty in stroke medicine)
* Allergy
* Audio vestibular medicine
* Aviation and space medicine
* Cardiology (with possible subspecialty in stroke medicine)
* Clinical genetics
* Clinical neurophysiology
* Clinical oncology
* Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics (with possible subspecialty in stroke medicine)
* Dermatology
* Endocrinology and diabetes mellitus
* Gastroenterology (with possible subspecialty in hepatology)
* General (internal) medicine (with possible subspecialty in metabolic medicine or stroke medicine)
* Genito-urinary medicine
* Geriatric medicine (with possible subspecialty in stroke medicine)
* Haematology

Many training programmes provide dual accreditation with general (internal) medicine and are involved in the general care to hospitalised patients. These are acute medicine, cardiology, Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, endocrinology and diabetes mellitus, gastroenterology, infectious diseases, renal medicine, respiratory medicine and often, rheumatology. The role of general medicine, after a period of decline, was reemphasised by the Royal College of Physicians of London report from the Future Hospital Commission (2013).

==== European Union ====
The European Board of Internal Medicine (EBIM) was formed as a collaborative effort between the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS) - Internal Medicine Section and the European Federation of Internal Medicine (EFIM) to provide guidance on standardizing training and practice of internal medicine throughout Europe. The EBIM published training requirements in 2016 for postgraduate education in internal medicine, and efforts to create a European Certificate of Internal Medicine (ECIM) to facilitate the free movement of medical professionals with the EU are currently underway.

The internal medicine specialist is recognized in every country in the European Union and typically requires five years of multi-disciplinary post-graduate education. The specialty of internal medicine is seen as providing care in a wide variety of conditions involving every organ system and is distinguished from family medicine in that the latter provides a broader model of care the includes both surgery and obstetrics in both adults and children.

==== Australia ====
Accreditation for medical education and training programs in Australia is provided by the Australian Medical Council (AMC) and the Medical Council of New Zealeand (MCNZ). The Medical Board of Australia (MBA) is the registering body for Australian doctors and provides information to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). Medical graduates apply for provisional registration in order to complete intern training. Those completing an accredited internship program are then eligible to apply for general registration. Once the candidate completes the required basic and advanced post-graduate training and a written and clinical examination, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians confers designation Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (FRACP). Basic training consists of three years of full-time equivalent (FTE) training (including intern year) and advanced training consists of 3–4 years, depending on specialty. The fields of specialty practice are approved by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) and managed by the MBA. The following is a list of currently recognized specialist physicians.

* Cardiology
* Clinical genetics
* Clinical pharmacology
* Endocrinology
* Gastroenterology and hepatology
* General medicine
* Geriatric medicine
* Haemotology
* Immunology and allergy
* Infectious diseases
* Medical oncology
* Nephrology
* Neurology
* Nuclear medicine
* Respiratory and sleep medicine
* Rheumatology

==== Canada ====
After completing medical school, internists in Canada require an additional four years of training. Internists desiring to subspecialize are required to complete two additional years of training that may begin after the third year of internist training. The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) is a national non-profit agency that oversees and accredits medical education in Canada. A full medical license in Internal Medicine in Canada requires a medical degree, a license from the Medical Council of Canada, completion of the required post-graduate education, and certification from the RCPSC. Any additional requirements from separate medical regulatory authorities in each province or territory is also required. Internists may practice in Canada as generalists in Internal Medicine or serve in one of seventeen subspecialty areas. Internists may work in many settings including outpatient clinics, inpatient wards, critical care units, and emergency departments. The currently recognized subspecialties include the following:

* Critical care medicine
* Cardiology
* Infectious diseases
* Neurology
* Respiratory medicine
* Rheumatology
* Endocrinology and metabolism
* Gastroenterology
* General internal medicine
* Geriatrics
* Hematology
* Medical oncology
* Clinical allergy and immunology
* Dermatology
* Nephrology
==Medical diagnosis and treatment==

Medicine is mainly focused on the art of diagnosis and treatment with medication. The diagnostic process involves gathering data, generating one or more diagnostic hypotheses, and iteratively testing these potential diagnoses against dynamic disease profiles to determine the best course of action for the patient.

=== Gathering data ===
Data may be gathered directly from the patient in medical history-taking and physical examination. Previous medical records including laboratory findings, imaging, and clinical notes from other physicians is also an important source of information; however, it is vital to talk to and examine the patient to find out what the patient is currently experiencing to make an accurate diagnosis.

Internists often can perform and interpret diagnostic tests like EKGs and ultrasound imaging (Point-of-care Ultrasound – PoCUS).

Internists who pursue sub-specialties have additional diagnostic tools, including those listed below. 
* Cardiology: angioplasty, cardioversion, cardiac ablation, intra-aortic balloon pump
* Critical care medicine: mechanical ventilation
* Gastroenterology: endoscopy and ERCP
* Nephrology: dialysis
* Pulmonology: bronchoscopy
Other tests are ordered, and patients are also referred to specialists for further evaluation.  The effectiveness and efficiency of the specialist referral process is an area of potential improvement.

=== Generating diagnostic hypotheses ===
Determining which pieces of information are most important to the next phase of the diagnostic process is of vital importance. It is during this stage that clinical bias like anchoring or premature closure may be introduced. Once key findings are determined, they are compared to profiles of possible diseases.  These profiles include findings that are typically associated with the disease and are based on the likelihood that someone with the disease has a particular symptom.  A list of potential diagnoses is termed the &quot;differential diagnosis&quot; for the patient and is typically ordered from most likely to least likely, with special attention given to those conditions that have dire consequences for the patient if they were missed. Epidemiology and endemic conditions are also considered in creating and evaluating the list of diagnoses.

The list is dynamic and changes as the physician obtains additional information that makes a condition more (&quot;rule-in&quot;) or less (&quot;rule-out&quot;) likely based on the disease profile.  The list is used to determine what information will be acquired next, including which diagnostic test or imaging modality to order.  The selection of tests is also based on the physician&#x27;s knowledge of the specificity and sensitivity of a particular test.

An important part of this process is knowledge of the various ways that a disease can present in a patient.  This knowledge is gathered and shared to add to the database of disease profiles used by physicians. This is especially important in rare diseases.

=== Communication ===
Communication is a vital part of the diagnostic process. The Internist uses both synchronous and asynchronous communication with other members of the medical care team, including other internists, radiologists, specialists, and laboratory technicians.  Tools to evaluate teamwork exist and have been employed in multiple settings.

Communication to the patient is also important to ensure there is informed consent and shared decision-making throughout the diagnostic process.

=== Treatment ===
Treatment modalities generally include both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, depending on the primary diagnosis. Additional treatment options include referral to specialist care including physical therapy and rehabilitation.  Treatment recommendations differ in the acute inpatient and outpatient settings. Continuity of care and long-term follow-up is crucial in successful patient outcomes.

=== Prevention and other services ===
Aside from diagnosing and treating acute conditions, the Internist may also assess disease risk and recommend preventive screening and intervention.  Some of the tools available to the Internist include genetic evaluation.

Internists also routinely provide pre-operative medical evaluations including individualized assessment and communication of operative risk.

Training the next generation of internists is an important part of the profession.  As mentioned above, post-graduate medical education is provided by licensed physicians as part of accredited education programs that are usually affiliated with teaching hospitals. Studies show that there are no differences in patient outcomes in teaching versus non-teaching facilities. Medical research is an important part of most post-graduate education programs, and many licensed physicians continue to be involved in research activities after completing post-graduate training.

== Ethics ==
Inherent in any medical profession are legal and ethical considerations. Specific laws vary by jurisdiction and may or may not be congruent with ethical considerations. Thus, a strong ethical foundation is paramount to any medical profession. Medical ethics guidelines in the Western world typically follow four principles including beneficence, non-maleficence, patient autonomy, and justice. These principles underlie the patient-physician relationship and the obligation to put the welfare and interests of the patient above their own.

=== Patient-physician relationship ===
The relationship is built upon the physician obligations of competency, respect for the patient, and appropriate referrals while the patient requirements include decision-making and provides or withdraws consent for any treatment plan.  Good communication is key to a strong relationship but has ethical considerations as well, including proper use of electronic communication and clear documentation.

=== Treatment and telemedicine ===
Providing treatment including prescribing medications based on remote information gathering without a proper established relationship is not accepted as good practice with few exceptions. These exceptions include cross-coverage within a practice and certain public health urgent or emergent issues.

The ethics of telemedicine including questions on its impact to diagnosis, physician-patient relationship, and continuity of care have been raised. However, with appropriate use and specific guidelines, risks may be minimized and the benefits including increased access to care may be realized.

=== Financial issues and conflicts of interest ===
Ethical considerations in financial include accurate billing practices and clearly defined financial relationships.  Physicians have both a professional duty and obligation under the justice principle to ensure that patients are provided the same care regardless of status or ability to pay.  However, informal copayment forgiveness may have legal ramifications and the providing professional courtesy may have negatively impact care.

Physicians must disclose all possible conflicts of interest including financial relationships, investments, research and referral relationships, and any other instances that may subjugate or give the appearance of subjugating patient care to self-interest.

=== Other topics ===
Other foundational ethical considerations include privacy, confidentiality, accurate and complete medical records, electronic health records, disclosure, and informed decision-making and consent.

Electronic health records have been shown to improve patient care but have risks including data breaches and inappropriate and/or unauthorized disclosure of protected health information.

Withholding information from a patient is typically seen as unethical and in violation of a patient&#x27;s right to make informed decisions.  However, in situations where a patient has requested not to be informed or to have the information provided to a second party or in an emergency situation in which the patient does not have decision-making capacity, withholding information may be appropriate.

<doc id="205267" wikidata="Q1617115" url="?curid=205267" title="Belford, Northumberland">
<text>Belford is a village and civil parish in Northumberland, England, about halfway between Alnwick and Berwick-upon-Tweed, a few miles inland from the east coast and just off the Great North Road, the A1. At the 2001 census it had a population of 1,055, increasing to 1,258 at the 2011 Census.

Belford is surrounded by rich pastoral farmland, and to the west of the village is found one of the better rock climbing locations in the county, Bowden Doors.

== Governance ==
Belford is in the parliamentary constituency of Berwick-upon-Tweed and is currently served by David Smith (Labour). Belford is served by Northumberland County Council.

== Economy ==
The area attracts tourists and there are also a number of businesses based in Belford.

== Landmarks ==

===Belford Hall===

Belford Hall is a Grade I listed building, an 18th-century mansion house.

The Manor of Belford was acquired by the Dixon family in 1726 and in 1752 Abraham Dixon built a mansion house in a Palladian style to a design by architect James Paine. In 1770 heiress Margaret Dixon married William Brown. Their daughter later married Newcastle upon Tyne merchant, Lt. Col. William Clark, Deputy Lieutenant and High Sheriff of Northumberland
who, in 1818, remodelled the house and added two new wings, with the assistance of architect John Dobson.

An extensive park, created in the mid 18th century, retains several original features and has been designated a conservation area. An 18th-century folly in the park is a Grade II listed building. During World War II the Hall was requisitioned by the Army and thereafter became neglected and dilapidated. In the 1980s it was acquired by the Northern Heritage Trust, renovated and restored and converted to residential flats.

===Spindlestone Ducket Mill===
This is located about 3 km east of Belford, and is an 18th-century tapering cylindrical stone tower with a conical roof of Welsh slate. Its usage is uncertain, being sometimes classified as a windmill and sometimes as a dovecote.

===Westhall===
Westhall is a privately owned Victorian house built in the style of the castellated fortified house that it replaced on the same site. The moat that surrounded the original building can still clearly be seen. It is now in use as a farmhouse.

==History==
For much of the Middle Ages, Belford was at the forefront of the ongoing border conflict between the Scots and the English and it is believed that only Well House escaped damage or destruction at the hands of Scottish raiders. In 1272 it is recorded that Walter de Huntercombe, the Lord of the Manor, was charged with &#x27;assisting pirates&#x27;. They had seized, by force, goods belonging to some wealthy Spanish merchants and landed with their booty on Holy Island.

In 1726, A wealthy city merchant, Abraham Dixon bought the Belford Estate. He made improvements which enhanced the fortunes of its inhabitants significantly including purchasing a licence in 1742 allowing him to hold a weekly market and two annual fairs at Belford. His son continued improvements after his death in 1746 and by 1770, a visitor was able to report the existence of a woollen mill, a tannery, collieries and a &#x27;large lime kiln&#x27;. Improvements to hygiene were also imposed upon the inhabitants with the forced removal of muck heaps from the houses and the banning of swine.

Larger market towns have gradually replaced Belford in importance and the location of the station outside of the town itself did nothing to halt a gradual decline in its fortunes since the end of the 19th century. Many of the features of its heyday have been retained however.

== Transport ==

Belford was for many years a coaching stop on the main A1 road from London to Edinburgh, which passed through the village. However, in 1983 a bypass was opened, and, freed from the constant traffic and pollution, the village could hold events on the High Street and in the Market Place once again.

Belford railway station opened on 29 March 1847. Freight services ceased on 7 June 1965 and the station finally closed for passenger services on 20 January 1968. However, on 8 February 2010 Northumberland County Council agreed plans to resume passenger services by constructing a new platform, access and car parking.

== Education ==
St Mary&#x27;s Church of England Voluntary Aided Middle School in Williams Way, Belford provides mainstream education for just under 100 boys and girls aged from nine to thirteen.

==Churches==
The Church of England parish church of St Mary is an Early English Gothic stone building on a hill overlooking the village square. Its tower has two bells. St Mary&#x27;s was built in about 1200, rebuilt in 1615, and renovated in 1700 and 1828.

Belford has also a United Reformed Church.

== Sports ==
In 2008, Belford Junior Football Club was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Award for Voluntary Service.

== Public services ==
Belford has an active local history society which has published a series of books in recent years, the latest being &#x27;Bygone Belford&#x27; (2010). In 1995 the society carried out A Survey of Belford. A booklet was published and the text of the survey is available online (see external links). A similar survey had been conducted quarter of a century earlier, in 1970.

==Belford in the media==
Belford is mentioned in &quot;The Great Race&quot; episode of the 1970s sitcom &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot; when Terry claims he overtook Bob in a bicycle race by cycling through the town whereas Bob used the A1 bypass.

Belford was featured on the TV programme Countryfile on 10 April 1994, following a telephone call to the BBC by a resident. At the time, like other villages in the area, Belford was suffering from an increasing number of power cuts. Inspired by the programme a group was formed and, after much campaigning and lobbying, the electricity supply was improved.

Belford again achieved momentary fame in April 2000 when protests about the closure of Barclays Bank in the village were picked up and used by the mainstream media to illustrate stories of rural decline brought about by bank branch closures. Until the 1980s there was a branch of Lloyds Bank, with limited opening hours towards the end.

During the 2000s a series of major floods affected the villagers causing widespread damage to property. This led to the development of a flood protection scheme for the village termed Natural Flood Management which was developed by a Newcastle University research group in conjunction with the Environment Agency flood levy team

<doc id="205322" wikidata="Q806285" url="?curid=205322" title="Bandolier">
<text>A bandolier or a bandoleer is a pocketed belt for holding either individual cartridges, belts of ammunition or grenades. It is usually slung sash-style over the shoulder and chest, with the ammunition pockets across the midriff and chest. Though functionally similar, they are distinct from chest rigs, which are designed to hold magazines instead.

==History==

By the late 15th century, the earliest viable handheld firearms in Europe were the arquebus fitted with a matchlock mechanism. The user kept his shot in a leather pouch and his powder in a flask with a volumetric spout. The spout was calibrated to deliver the proper charge for the user&#x27;s arquebus. With the advent of the heavy arquebus (later known as a musket) in the early 16th century, a spout large enough to measure the required powder was impractical. Furthermore, trying to double or triple charge from a flask was time consuming and could create a “missed” charge. A bandolier from whence would hang several little flasks each filled with a dedicated premeasured charge was the solution to this problem. Since these were loaded prior to going into battle, the musketeer could take the time to accurately measure each charge.

The bandolier was fitted with small wooden bottles called charges. The charges were recommended to be turned from a single piece of wood; a two-piece design (tube with a bottom) could come apart and metal charges make too much noise. The number of charges was determined from the size of the musket, that is, the weight of the ball it fired. Each musketeer was issued a pound of lead from which they would cast their ammunition. For instance, if they had a 1⅓ ounce () musket ball, a pound of lead would provide them with 12 balls, hence, 12 charges. A “two-ouncer” would have eight charges. Throughout Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries, the number of charges varied between 8 and 16. Additionally, the bandolier would be fitted with a bullet pouch and a priming flask. It might also carry an oil flask for the lock mechanism, a match keeper, or other accessories.

The evolution of a sparking type lock mechanism, such as the flintlock, paved the way for the development of paper cartridge containing a premeasured powder charge and a lead ball wrapped in paper. The bandolier then became a shoulder strap fitted to a bag or satchel wherein the cartridges could be carried. Eventually, any bag worn in the same style may also be described as a bandolier bag or possibles bag; similarly, pocketed belts holding ammunition worn around the waist may also be called bandoliers.
A somewhat different form of bandolier came into use in the late 19th century that held modern metallic cartridges and hand grenades. Bandoliers are now less common due to the use of detachable magazines and belt-fed firearms, though extra ammunition belts are often carried around the body like a bandolier. They are, however, still often used with shotguns, hand grenades, and grenade launchers.

Shotgun shells can easily be stored in traditionally designed bandoliers. In fact, some aftermarket shotgun slings are designed in a fashion similar to traditional bandoliers, albeit with a far more limited capacity.

In World War I and World War II, bandoliers were issued primarily to riflemen. They were made of cloth, stitched into pockets which held clips of rifle ammunition. In civilian use, bandoliers are often worn by hunters and recreational shooters using shotguns.

The Chetniks of World War II made heavy use of bandoliers, often carrying two over the shoulder and two around the hip, using the latter as a holster for revolvers and daggers.

Another modern use of a bandolier is for the automatic rifleman of a military fireteam. Since a squad automatic weapon is often belt-fed, an automatic rifleman will carry an extra belt on his person; either in a separate compartment or slung over the chest in bandolier fashion.
The bandolier was used to keep ammunition off a soldier&#x27;s hips, as carrying too much weight on the hips can constrain movement and cause difficulty in retrieving the ammunition.

<text>Hjalmar Fridolf Siilasvuo (born Hjalmar Fridolf Strömberg, 18 March 1892 – 11 January 1947) was a Finnish lieutenant general (), a knight of the Mannerheim Cross and a member of the Jäger Movement. He participated in the Eastern Front of World War I, the Finnish Civil War, the Winter War, Continuation War and the Lapland War.

==Early life==
Hjalmar Fridolf Siilasvuo was born as Hjalmar Fridolf Strömberg on 18 March 1892 in Helsinki to newspaper reporter Frans Strömberg and Hulda Röman. He graduated as an ylioppilas in 1911 from Svenska normallyceum i Helsingfors and began to study law. During his studies, he became involved in the Jäger Movement, which aimed at sending Finnish volunteers to receive military training in Germany. As a member of the movement, Siilavuo left for Germany in early 1915. While in Germany, the Finnish volunteers formed the 27th Royal Prussian Jäger Battalion, fighting for the Imperial German Army on the Eastern Front of World War I. During this time, Siilasvuo took part in several battles in the regions of Misa, Gulf of Riga and Lielupe.

Siilasvuo returned to Finland in 1918 together with the bulk of the Finnish Jägers, taking part in the Finnish Civil War on the side of the Whites. First a lieutenant, but soon promoted to a captain, Siilasvuo saw action as a company commander in the Battles of Tampere and Viipuri. Siilasvuo was given command of a battalion in late 1918. In 1920, he was promoted to a major and married pharmacist Salli Kolsi. The couple had three children between 1922 and 1926.

In 1926, Siilasvuo graduated from War College, was promoted to a lieutenant colonel and transferred to the Ministry of Defence Department of War Affairs () where he was promoted to a chief of office () in 1927 and to head of department in 1928. Later in 1928, he again took command of a battalion, which was followed by a promotion to both the rank of colonel and the command of a brigade/regiment in 1933. He was given command of the Pohjanmaa Military District in 1934. In 1936, he finnicized his surname from the Swedish Strömberg to Siilasvuo and became a member of the Oulu city council. He held the position until 1940.

==Winter War and Interim Peace==

During the Finno-Soviet Winter War of 1939–1940, Siilasvuo was in charge of the Finnish forces in the region of Suomussalmi. The initially approximately brigade-sized formation under his command eventually grew to a size where it was reorganized as the 9th Division. The Battle of Suomussalmi, as the actions in the region came to be known, resulted in the shattering of the Soviet 163rd Rifle Division which had been encircled in Suomussalmi, as well as the destruction of the Soviet 44th Rifle Division, which was attempting to reinforce the 163rd Division, in the Battle of Raate Road. The defense of Siilasvuo&#x27;s forces prevented the Soviet 9th Army from reaching Oulu, which would have resulted in the bisection of Finland into two separate theatres of operation. Siilasvuo&#x27;s forces were still engaged in the Battle of Kuhmo when the war ended.

In 1940, Siilasvuo was promoted to major general and was given command of the peace-time army&#x27;s V Corps. The same year, he also published a book on the Battle of Suomussalmi. Historian Mikko Uola describes the book as &quot;taking all credit for the success of Suomussalmi and completely ignoring other commanders who influenced the events, such as Siilasvuo&#x27;s superiors Viljo Tuompo and Paavo Susitaival, as well as his subordinates such as Alpo Marttinen.&quot;

==Continuation War and Lapland War==


During the 1941 Finno-German negotiations regarding plans for a future war with the Soviet Union, the Germans proposed that the Finns would be in charge of operations in the South-Eastern Finland and east of Lake Ladoga, with overall command of both Finnish and German troops in the area falling under the Finnish commander-in-chief, Marshal Mannerheim. In turn, the Finns would subordinate Siilasvuo&#x27;s peace-time V Corps (which would become the war time III Corps) to the headquarters of the German Army of Norway. Following the start of the Finnish mobilization on 10 June 1941, the corps was subordinated to the headquarters of the German Army of Norway on 15 June 1941, and was designated III Corps on 18 June 1941.

According to the German plans, Siilasvuo&#x27;s III Corps was to secure the southern flank of Operation Silver Fox, the German-led operation whose goal was the capture of Murmansk. The corps was to advance first to the Ukhta–Kestenga line and then to the Murmansk railroad and Kem. It soon became apparent that III Corps was the only corps-level unit of the Army of Norway to make significant progress. Operations of the two German corps of the Army of Norway were thus largely halted, and German reinforcements were allocated to support the attack of the III Corp. The main objective of the III Corps was to be the Murmansk railroad in the area of Loukhi. Despite the German reinforcements, III Corps was unable to reach Loukhi and by August both sides had settled for stationary warfare.

By 6 October 1941, the situation at the front had improved to a point where Nikolaus von Falkenhorst and Siilasvuo discussed continuing the III Corps&#x27;s advance towards Loukhi. Due to Hitler&#x27;s August order that the forces in the area were to go on the defensive, the plan was phrased as III Corp improving its positions. The Finnish high command was informed about the operation on 25 October, but nobody informed the German high command, OKH. The operation began on 30 October, but already on 5 November Siilasvuo was informed by the Finnish high command that the attack should be halted for political reasons, and that no additional Finnish reinforcements would be forthcoming despite Siilasvuo&#x27;s wishes. The United States of America had given the Finnish government a note demanding the attack be stopped, which in turn had resulted in the Finnish President Risto Ryti expressing his concern over the operation to Mannerheim. By 11 November, Siilasvuo was actively slowing down the attack by ordering construction of further field fortifications and on 17 November he gave a written order to halt the attack. By December the fighting in the area had calmed down. Siilasvuo was promoted to lieutenant general in 1942 and, in late 1942, was made the inspector of military schools. Siilasvuo himself viewed this transfer as a punishment.

Following the end of the Siege of Leningrad in January 1944, the Finnish high command began preparations for a Soviet offensive. As part of these preparations it split the Kannas Group, responsible for the defence of the Karelian Isthmus, into two corps-level formations on 4 March 1944. The eastern side of the isthmus was handed to the III Corps, the headquarters of which was moved to the area from northern Finland, with Siilasvuo reinstated as the commander of the corps. The Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk offensive began on 9 July 1944. Threatened to be cut off, III Corps fell back and eventually took defensive positions along Vuoksi. The III Corps front stabilized along the Vuoksi for the rest of the war, with the Soviet forces failing to break through on the III Corps sector despite several attempts.

As one of the terms of the Moscow Armistice, Finland had to remove of any German forces remaining in Finland. German forces in the Finnish north initially fell back towards Norway in unofficial cooperation with the Finnish forces. However, following the failure of Operation Tanne Ost which involved a German attempt to capture Gogland from its Finnish defenders, the Finno-German cooperation completely broke down. During the subsequent Lapland War, Siilasvuo&#x27;s III Corps was moved to northern Finland where it took overall command of all the Finnish forces participating in the operation. Over the following months, Siilasvuo&#x27;s forces slowly pushed the Germans out of Lapland, with the final German forces leaving Finland on 27 April 1945. Siilasvuo was awarded with the Mannerheim Cross in December 1944, with the bestowal document referencing his actions in the Winter War, the Continuation War and the Lapland War.

==Death and legacy==
Following the end of the Lapland War, Siilasvuo remained in military service, acting as the commander of the 1st Division from 1944 to 1947. He died in Oulu on 11 January 1947, and is buried in the Oulu Cemetery.

Siilasvuo&#x27;s son Ensio Siilasvuo, who had served as a platoon leader, staff officer and company commander in III Corps during the Continuation War, also became a Finnish general following service in peace-keeping duties for the United Nations.

During his life, Siilasvuo was granted several Finnish awards, the most notable of which are Mannerheim Cross 2nd Class, the Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose of Finland and the Order of the Cross of Liberty. He also received the German Iron Cross (both 1st and 2nd Class) and the Order of the German Eagle; and the Swedish Order of the Sword.

<doc id="205324" wikidata="Q5385916" url="?curid=205324" title="Anti-satellite weapon">
<text>Anti-satellite weapons (ASAT) are space weapons designed to incapacitate or destroy satellites for strategic or tactical purposes. Although no ASAT system has been utilized in warfare, a few countries (China, India, Russia, and the United States) have successfully shot down their own satellites to demonstrate their ASAT capabilities in a show of force. ASATs have also been used to remove decommissioned satellites. 

ASAT roles include: defensive measures against an adversary&#x27;s space-based and nuclear weapons, a force multiplier for a nuclear first strike, a countermeasure against an adversary&#x27;s anti-ballistic missile defense (ABM), an asymmetric counter to a technologically superior adversary, and a counter-value weapon.

Use of ASATs generates space debris, which can collide with other satellites and generate more space debris. A cascading multiplication of space debris could cause Earth to suffer from Kessler syndrome.

==History==
The first anti-satellite technologies were developed during the cold war, with the Soviet Istrebitel Sputnikov programme and the American SAINT. Since, other states have also developed or researched ASAT capabilities.

===Soviet Union===

The specter of bombardment satellites and the reality of ballistic missiles stimulated the Soviet Union to explore defensive space weapons. The Soviet Union first tested the Polyot interceptor in 1963 and successfully tested an orbital anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon in 1968. According to some accounts, Sergei Korolev started some work on the concept in 1956 at his OKB-1, while others attribute the work to Vladimir Chelomei&#x27;s OKB-52 around 1959. What is certain is that at the beginning of April 1960, Nikita Khrushchev held a meeting at his summer residence in Crimea, discussing an array of defence industry issues. Here, Chelomei outlined his rocket and spacecraft program, and received a go-ahead to start development of the UR-200 rocket, one of its many roles being the launcher for his anti-satellite project. The decision to start work on the weapon, as part of the Istrebitel Sputnikov (IS) (lit. &quot;destroyer of satellites&quot;) program, was made in March 1961.

The IS system was &quot;co-orbital&quot;, approaching its target over time and then exploding a shrapnel warhead close enough to kill it. The missile was launched when a target satellite&#x27;s ground track rises above the launch site. Once the satellite is detected, the missile is launched into orbit close to the targeted satellite. It takes 90 to 200 minutes (or one to two orbits) for the missile interceptor to get close enough to its target. The missile is guided by an on-board radar. The interceptor, which weighs , may be effective up to one kilometre from a target.

Delays in the UR-200 missile program prompted Chelomei to request R-7 rockets for prototype testing of the IS. The Polyot 1 and 2, launched on 1 November 1963 and 12 April 1964 respectively, carried out one such intercept test in early 1964. Later in the year Khrushchev cancelled the UR-200 in favour of the R-36, forcing the IS to switch to this launcher, whose space launcher version was developed as the Tsyklon-2. Delays in that program led to the introduction of a simpler version, the 2A, which launched its first IS test on 27 October 1967, and a second on 28 April 1968. Further tests carried out against a special target spacecraft, the DS-P1-M, which recorded hits by the IS warhead&#x27;s shrapnel.In November 1968, 4 years after Polyot 1 and 2 were tested for a potential Satellite intercept, Kosmos 248 was successfully destroyed by Kosmos 252 which came within the 5km &#x27;kill radius&#x27; and destroyed Kosmos 248 by detonating it&#x27;s warhead. A total of 23 launches have been identified as being part of the IS test series. The system was declared operational in February 1973.

Testing resumed in 1976 as a result of the US work on the Space Shuttle. Elements within the Soviet space industry convinced Leonid Brezhnev that the Shuttle was a single-orbit weapon that would be launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, manoeuvre to avoid existing anti-ballistic missile sites, bomb Moscow in a first strike, and then land. Although the Soviet military was aware these claims were false, Brezhnev believed them and ordered a resumption of IS testing along with a Shuttle of their own. As part of this work the IS system was expanded to allow attacks at higher altitudes and was declared operational in this new arrangement on 1 July 1979. However, in 1983, Yuri Andropov ended all IS testing and all attempts to resume it failed. Ironically, it was at about this point that the US started its own testing in response to the Soviet program.

In the early 1980s, the Soviet Union also started developing a counterpart to the US air-launched ASAT system, using modified MiG-31D &#x27;Foxhounds&#x27; (at least six of which were completed) as the launch platform. The system was called 30P6 &quot;Kontakt&quot;, the missile used is 79M6. The USSR also experimented with arming the Almaz space stations with Rikhter R-23 aircraft auto-cannons. Another Soviet design was the 11F19DM Skif-DM/Polyus, an orbital megawatt laser that failed on launch in 1987.

In 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev visited Baikonur Cosmodrome and was shown an anti-satellite system called &quot;Naryad&quot; (Sentry), also known as 14F11, launched by UR-100N rockets.

===United States===

In the late 1950s, the US Air Force started a series of advanced strategic missile projects under the designation Weapon System WS-199A. One of the projects studied under the 199A umbrella was Martin&#x27;s &quot;Bold Orion&quot; air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) for the B-47 Stratojet, based on the rocket motor from the Sergeant missile. Twelve test launches were carried out between 26 May 1958 and 13 October 1959, but these were generally unsuccessful and further work as an ALBM ended. The system was then modified with the addition of an Altair upper stage to create an anti-satellite weapon with a range. Only one test flight of the anti-satellite mission was carried out, making a mock attack on the Explorer 6 at an altitude of . To record its flight path, the &quot;Bold Orion&quot; transmitted telemetry to the ground, ejected flares to aid visual tracking, and was continuously tracked by radar. The missile successfully passed within of the satellite, which is suitable for use with a nuclear weapon, but useless for conventional warheads.

A similar project carried out under 199A, Lockheed&#x27;s High Virgo, was initially another ALBM for the B-58 Hustler, likewise based on the Sergeant. It too was adapted for the anti-satellite role, and made an attempted intercept on Explorer 5 on 22 September 1959. However, shortly after launch communications with the missile were lost and the camera packs could not be recovered to see if the test was successful. In any event, work on the WS-199 projects ended with the start of the GAM-87 Skybolt project. Simultaneous US Navy projects were also abandoned although smaller projects did continue until the early 1970s.

The use of high-altitude nuclear explosions to destroy satellites was considered after the tests of the first conventional missile systems in the 1960s. During the Hardtack Teak test in 1958 observers noted the damaging effects of the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) caused by the explosions on electronic equipment, and during the Starfish Prime test in 1962 the EMP from a warhead detonated over the Pacific damaged three satellites and also disrupted power transmission and communications across the Pacific. Further testing of weapons effects was carried out under the DOMINIC I series. An adapted version of the nuclear armed Nike Zeus was used for an ASAT from 1962. Codenamed &quot;Mudflap&quot;, the missile was designated DM-15S and a single missile was deployed at the Kwajalein atoll until 1966 when the project was ended in favour of the USAF Thor-based Program 437 ASAT which was operational until 6 March 1975.

Another area of research was directed-energy weapons, including a nuclear-explosion powered X-ray laser proposal developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in 1968. Other research was based on more conventional lasers or masers and developed to include the idea of a satellite with a fixed laser and a deployable mirror for targeting. LLNL continued to consider more edgy technology but their X-ray laser system development was cancelled in 1977 (although research into X-ray lasers was resurrected during the 1980s as part of the SDI).

ASATs were generally given low priority until 1982, when information about a successful USSR program became widely known in the west. A &quot;crash program&quot; followed, which developed into the Vought ASM-135 ASAT, based on the AGM-69 SRAM with an Altair upper stage. The system was carried on a modified F-15 Eagle that carried the missile directly under the central line of the plane. The F-15&#x27;s guidance system was modified for the mission and provided new directional cuing through the pilot&#x27;s head-up display, and allowed for mid-course updates via a data link. The first launch of the new anti-satellite missile took place in January 1984. The first, and only, successful interception was on 13 September 1985. The F-15 took off from Edwards Air Force Base, climbed to and vertically launched the missile at the Solwind P78-1, a US gamma ray spectroscopy satellite orbiting at , which was launched in 1979. The last piece of debris from the destruction of Solwind P78-1, catalogued as COSPAR 1979-017GX, SATCAT 16564, deorbited 9 May 2004. Although successful, the program was cancelled in 1988.
USA-193 was an American reconnaissance satellite, which was launched on 14 December 2006 by a Delta II rocket, from Vandenberg Air Force Base. It was reported about a month after launch that the satellite had failed. In January 2008, it was noted that the satellite was decaying from orbit at a rate of per day. After publicly announcing its intention to do so a week earlier, on 21 February 2008, the US Navy destroyed USA-193 in Operation Burnt Frost, using a ship-fired RIM-161 Standard Missile 3 about 247 km (153 mi) above the Pacific Ocean. That test produced 174 pieces of orbital debris large enough to detect that were cataloged by the US military. While most of the debris re-entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere within a few months, a few pieces lasted slightly longer because they were thrown into higher orbits. The final piece of detectable USA-193 debris re-entered on 28 October 2009.

According to the US government, the primary reason for destroying the satellite was the approximately of toxic hydrazine fuel contained on board, which could pose health risks to persons in the immediate vicinity of the crash site should any significant amount survive the re-entry. On 20 February 2008, it was announced that the launch was carried out successfully and an explosion was observed consistent with the destruction of the hydrazine fuel tank.

The United States has since ceased the testing of direct-ascent anti-satellite missiles, having outlawed the practice in 2022.

===Strategic Defense Initiative and the Cold War ===
The era of the Strategic Defense Initiative (proposed in 1983) focused primarily on the development of systems to defend against nuclear warheads, however, some of the technologies developed may be useful also for anti-satellite use.

The Strategic Defense Initiative gave the US and Soviet ASAT programs a major boost; ASAT projects were adapted for ABM use and the reverse was also true. The initial US plan was to use the already-developed MHV as the basis for a space based constellation of about 40 platforms deploying up to 1,500 kinetic interceptors. By 1988 the US project had evolved into an extended four-stage development. The initial stage would consist of the Brilliant Pebbles defense system, a satellite constellation of 4,600 kinetic interceptors (KE ASAT) of each in Low Earth orbit and their associated tracking systems. The next stage would deploy the larger platforms and the following phases would include the laser and charged particle beam weapons that would be developed by that time from existing projects such as MIRACL. The first stage was intended to be completed by 2000 at a cost of around $125 billion.

Research in the US and the Soviet Union was proving that the requirements, at least for orbital based energy weapon systems, were, with available technology, close to impossible. Nonetheless, the strategic implications of a possible unforeseen breakthrough in technology forced the USSR to initiate massive spending on research in the 12th Five Year Plan, drawing all the various parts of the project together under the control of GUKOS and matching the US proposed deployment date of 2000. Ultimately, the Soviet Union approached the point of experimental implementation of orbital laser platforms with the (failed) launch of Polyus.

Both countries began to reduce expenditure from 1989 and the Russian Federation unilaterally discontinued all SDI research in 1992. Research and Development (both of ASAT systems and other space based/deployed weapons) has, however, reported to have been resumed under the government of Vladimir Putin as a counter to renewed US Strategic Defense efforts post Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. However, the status of these efforts, or indeed how they are being funded through National Reconnaissance Office projects of record, remains unclear. The US has begun working on a number of programs which could be foundational for a space-based ASAT. These programs include the Experimental Spacecraft System (USA-165), the Near Field Infrared Experiment (NFIRE), and the space-based interceptor (SBI).

===Russia===

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the MiG-31D project was put on hold due to reduced defence expenditures. However, in August 2009, Alexander Zelin announced that the Russian Air Force had resumed this program. The Sokol Eshelon is a prototype laser system based on an A-60 airplane which is reported to be restarting development in 2012.

Three more launches were reportedly held in December 2016, on 26 March 2018, and on 23 December 2018the latter two from a TEL.

A new type of ASAT missile was seen carried by a MiG-31 in September 2018.

On 15 April 2020, US officials said Russia conducted a direct ascent anti-satellite missile test that could take out spacecraft or satellites in low Earth orbit. A new test launch took place on 16 December 2020.

In November 2021, Kosmos 1408 was successfully destroyed by a Russian anti-satellite missile in a test, causing a debris field that affected the International Space Station.

In 2024, U.S. intelligence sources hinted that Russia was working on an anti-satellite weapon with some sort of nuclear technology, though it was unclear if it was a nuclear weapon or merely a nuclear-powered device.

===China===

On 11 January 2007, the People&#x27;s Republic of China successfully destroyed a defunct Chinese weather satellite, Fengyun-1C (FY-1C, COSPAR ). The destruction was reportedly carried out by an SC-19 ASAT missile with a kinetic kill warhead similar in concept to the American Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle. FY-1C was a weather satellite orbiting Earth in polar orbit at an altitude of about , with a mass of about . Launched in 1999, it was the fourth satellite in the Fengyun series.

The missile was launched from a mobile Transporter-Erector-Launcher (TEL) vehicle at Xichang () and the warhead destroyed the satellite in a head-on collision at an extremely high relative velocity. Evidence suggests that the same SC-19 system was also tested in 2005, 2006, 2010, and 2013. In January 2007 China demonstrated a satellite knock out whose detonation alone caused more than 40,000 new chunks of debris with a diameter larger than one centimeter and a sudden increase in the total amount of debris in orbit.

In May 2013, the Chinese government announced the launch of a suborbital rocket carrying a scientific payload to study the upper ionosphere. However, US government sources described it as the first test of a new ground-based ASAT system. An open source analysis by Secure World Foundation, based in part on commercial satellite imagery, found that it may indeed have been a test of a new ASAT system that could potentially threaten US satellites in geostationary Earth orbit. Similarly on 5 February 2018, China tested an exoatmospheric ballistic missile with the potential to be used as an ASAT weapon, the Dong Neng-3, with state media reporting that the test was purely defensive and it achieved its desired objectives.

===India===
In a televised press briefing during the 97th Indian Science Congress held in Thiruvananthapuram, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) Director General Rupesh announced that India was developing the necessary technology that could be combined to produce a weapon to destroy enemy satellites in orbit. On 10 February 2010, DRDO Director-General and Scientific Advisor to the Defence Minister, Dr. Vijay Kumar Saraswat stated that India had &quot;all the building blocks necessary&quot; to integrate an anti-satellite weapon to neutralize hostile satellites in low earth and polar orbits.

In April 2012, DRDO&#x27;s chairman V. K. Saraswat said that India possessed the critical technologies for an ASAT weapon from radars and interceptors developed for Indian Ballistic Missile Defence Programme. In July 2012, Ajay Lele, an Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses fellow, wrote that an ASAT test would bolster India&#x27;s position if an international regime to control the proliferation of ASATs similar to NPT were to be established. He suggested that a low-orbit test against a purpose-launched satellite would not be seen as irresponsible. The programme was sanctioned in 2017.

On 27 March 2019, India successfully conducted an ASAT test called Mission Shakti. The interceptor was able to strike a test satellite at a altitude in low earth orbit (LEO), thus successfully testing its ASAT missile. The interceptor was launched at around 05:40 UTC at the Integrated Test Range (ITR) in Chandipur, Odisha and hit its target Microsat-R after 168 seconds. The operation was named &quot;Mission Shakti&quot;. The missile system was developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)—a research wing of the Indian defence services. With this test, India became the fourth nation with anti-satellite missile capabilities. India stated that this capability is a deterrent and is not directed against any nation.
In a statement released after the test, Indian Ministry of External Affairs said that the test was conducted at low altitude to ensure that the resulting debris would &quot;decay and fall back onto the Earth within weeks&quot;. According to Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, some debris might persist for a year, but most should burn up in the atmosphere within several weeks. Brian Weeden of Secure World Foundation agreed, but warned about the possibility of some fragments getting boosted to higher orbits. US Air Force Space Command said that it was tracking 270 pieces of debris from the test.

Following the test, acting United States Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan warned about the risks of space debris caused by ASAT tests, but later added that he did not expect debris from the Indian test to last. The United States Department of State acknowledged Ministry of External Affairs&#x27; statement on space debris and reiterated its intention to pursue shared interests in space including on space security with India. Russia acknowledged India&#x27;s statement on the test not being targeted against any nation and invited India to join the Russian–Chinese proposal for a treaty against weaponisation of space.

=== Israel ===
The Arrow 3 or Hetz 3 is an anti-ballistic missile, currently in service. It provides exo-atmospheric interception of ballistic missiles. It is also believed (by experts such as Prof. Yitzhak Ben Yisrael, chairman of the Israel Space Agency), that it will operate as an ASAT.

In November 2023, Israel&#x27;s Arrow 3 missile defense system successfully intercepted a missile above the Earths atmosphere launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen. While it was not a satellite, this was the first time a missile was intercepted in space during wartime; demonstrating the theoretical capabilities of such a system to intercept a satellite.

==Limits of anti-satellite weapons==

While it has been suggested that a country intercepting the satellites of another country in the event of a conflict could seriously hinder the latter&#x27;s military operations, the ease of shooting down orbiting satellites has been questioned. Although satellites have been successfully intercepted at low orbiting altitudes, the tracking of military satellites for a length of time could be complicated by defensive measures like inclination changes. Depending on the level of tracking capabilities, the interceptor would have to pre-determine the point of impact while compensating for the satellite&#x27;s lateral movement and the time for the interceptor to climb and move.

US intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) satellites orbit at about high and move at , so if conflict was to break out between the United States and China, a Chinese Intermediate-range ballistic missile would need to compensate for of movement in the three minutes it takes to boost to that altitude. However, even if the ISR satellite is knocked out, the US possesses an extensive array of crewed and uncrewed ISR aircraft that could perform missions at standoff ranges from Chinese land-based air defences.

Global Positioning System and communications satellites orbit at higher altitudes of and respectively, and this puts them out of range of solid-fuelled intercontinental ballistic missiles. Liquid-fuelled space launch vehicles could reach those altitudes, but they are more time-consuming to launch and could be attacked on the ground before being able to launch in rapid succession. The constellation of 30 GPS satellites provides redundancy where at least four satellites can be received in six orbital planes at any one time, so an attacker would need to disable at least six satellites to disrupt the network. However, even if the attack is successful, signal degradation only lasts for 95 minutes and backup inertial navigation systems (INS) would still be available for relatively accurate movement as well as laser guidance for weapons targeting. For communications, the Naval Telecommunications System (NTS) used by the US Navy uses three elements: tactical communications among a battle group; long-haul communications between shore-based forward Naval Communications Stations (NAVCOMSTAs) and deployed afloat units; and strategic communication connecting NAVCOMSTAs with National Command Authorities (NCA). The first two elements use line-of-sight () and extended line-of-sight () radios respectively, so only strategic communications are dependent on satellites. China would prefer to cut off deployed units from each other and then negotiate with the NCA to have the battle group withdraw or stand down, but ASATs could only achieve the opposite. Moreover, even if somehow a communications satellite were hit, a battle group could still perform its missions in the absence of direct guidance from the NCA.

=== Proposed law ===

On November 1, 2022, a UN working group adopted for the first time a resolution calling on countries to ban destructive anti-satellite missile tests. Although not legally binding, the resolution reflects an increase in international political support for a ban on these weapons. Other countries have noted that the United States has already tested its ASAT destruction capability and, therefore, this U.S.-backed resolution limits the progress of the other countries.

<text>Kookaburras (pronounced ) are terrestrial tree kingfishers of the genus Dacelo native to Australia and New Guinea, which grow to between in length and weigh around . The name is a loanword from Wiradjuri &quot;guuguubarra&quot;, onomatopoeic of its call. The loud, distinctive call of the laughing kookaburra is widely used as a stock sound effect in situations that involve an Australian bush setting or tropical jungle, especially in older movies.

They are found in habitats ranging from humid forest to arid savannah, as well as in suburban areas with tall trees or near running water. Though they belong to the larger group known as &quot;kingfishers&quot;, kookaburras are not closely associated with water.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Dacelo&quot; was introduced by English zoologist William Elford Leach in 1815. The type species is the laughing kookaburra. The name &quot;Dacelo&quot; is an anagram of &quot;alcedo&quot;, the Latin word for a kingfisher. A molecular study published in 2017 found that the genus &quot;Dacelo&quot;, as then defined, was paraphyletic. The shovel-billed kookaburra was previously classified in the monotypic genus &quot;Clytoceyx&quot;, but was reclassified into &quot;Dacelo&quot; based on phylogenetic evidence.

==Classification and species==
Five species of kookaburra can be found in Australia, New Guinea, and the Aru Islands:




The laughing and blue-winged species are direct competitors in the area where their ranges now overlap. This suggests that these two species evolved in isolation, possibly during a period when Australia and New Guinea were more distant.

The Kamilaroi/Gamilaraay and Wiradjuri people named this bird “guuguubarra”. It is native to the eastern mainland part of Australia. 

Kookaburras are sexually dimorphic. This is noticeable in the blue-winged and the rufous-bellied, where males have blue tails and females have reddish-brown tails.

==Behaviour==

Kookaburras are almost exclusively carnivorous, eating mice, snakes, insects, small reptiles, and the young of other birds. Unlike many other kingfishers, they rarely eat fish, although they have been known to take goldfish from garden ponds. In zoos, they are usually fed food suitable for birds of prey.

Although most birds will accept handouts and take meat from barbecues, feeding kookaburras ground beef or pet food is not advised, because they do not include enough calcium and roughage.

=== Hunting ===
Kookaburras are usually seen waiting for their prey on powerlines or low tree branches. When they see their prey they dive down and grab them with their strong beak. If the prey is small it will be eaten whole, but if the prey is larger then the kookaburra bashes it against a tree or the ground to make it softer and easier to eat.

They are territorial, except for the rufous-bellied, which often live with their young from the previous season. They often sing as a chorus to mark their territory.

=== Diet ===
A Kookaburra&#x27;s diet includes lizards, snakes, frogs, rodents, beetles, worms, bugs, and other small mammals.

=== Habitat ===
They live in sclerophyll woodland and open forests, in almost any area with trees large enough to hold the nests and open patches with hunting areas. The kookaburras are declining in population because of predators, lack of prey, and the environment.

==Conservation==
All kookaburra species are listed as least concern. Australian law protects native birds, including kookaburras.

==In popular culture==

The distinctive sound of the laughing kookaburra&#x27;s call resembles human laughter, is widely used in filmmaking and television productions, as well as certain Disney theme-park attractions, regardless of African, Asian, or South American jungle settings. Kookaburras have also appeared in several video games, including (&quot;Lineage II&quot;, &quot;Battletoads&quot;, and &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;). The children&#x27;s television series &quot;Splatalot!&quot; includes an Australian character called &quot;Kookaburra&quot; (or &quot;Kook&quot;), whose costume includes decorative wings that recall the bird&#x27;s plumage, and who is noted for his distinctive, high-pitched laugh. Olly the Kookaburra was one of the three mascots chosen for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. The other mascots were Millie the Echidna and Syd the Platypus. The call of a kookaburra nicknamed &quot;Jacko&quot; was for many years used as the morning opening theme by ABC radio stations, and for Radio Australia&#x27;s overseas broadcasts.

===Book===
* The opening theme from ABC was the basis for a children&#x27;s book by Brooke Nicholls titled &quot;Jacko, the Broadcasting Kookaburra — His Life and Adventures.&quot;
* In William Arden&#x27;s 1969 book, &quot;The Mystery of the Laughing Shadow&quot; (one of the Three Investigators series for young readers), the laughing kookaburra is integral to the plot.

===Film===

* Heard in some of the early Johnny Weissmuller films, the first occurrence was in &quot;Tarzan and the Green Goddess&quot; (1938).
* The call is heard in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939), &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; (1948), &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; (1960), &quot;Cape Fear&quot; (1962), &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;, and other films.
* The dolphin call in the television series &quot;Flipper&quot; (1964-7) is a modified kookaburra call.

===Music===

* &quot;Kookaburra [sits in the old gum tree]&quot;, a well-known children&#x27;s song, was written in 1932 by Marion Sinclair.

===Postage stamps===

* A six-pence () stamp was issued in 1914.
* A three-pence () commemorative Australian stamp was issued for the 1928 Melbourne International Philatelic Exhibition. 
* A six-pence () stamp was issued in 1932.
* A 38¢ () Australian stamp issued in 1990 features a pair of kookaburras.
* An international $1.70 () Australian stamp featuring an illustrated kookaburra was released in 2013.
* A $1.10 () laughing kookaburra stamp issued in 2020.

===Money===

* An Australian coin known as the Silver Kookaburra has been minted annually since 1990.
* The kookaburra is featured multiple times on the Australian twenty-dollar note.

===Usage across sport===
* The Australian 12-m yacht &quot;Kookaburra III&quot; lost the America&#x27;s Cup in 1987.
* The Australia men&#x27;s national field hockey team is nicknamed after the kookaburra. They were world champions in field hockey in 1986, 2010 and 2014.
* Australian sports equipment company Kookaburra Sport is named after the bird.

<doc id="205357" wikidata="Q2410919" url="?curid=205357" title="The Domination">
<text>The Domination of the Draka (also called the Draka series or the Draka saga) is a dystopian science fiction alternate history series by American author S. M. Stirling. 

The series comprises a main trilogy of novels as well as one crossover novel set after the original and a book of short stories.

The series focuses on Draka (later The Domination), a totalitarian, expansionist nation founded in Southern Africa by British settlers in the 18th century where an especially cruel manifestation of a slavery-regime plays an increasingly central role.

==Novels==


==Fictional universe==
The world of the Domination diverges when the Dutch Republic joins the American Revolutionary War two years earlier than in our history and is forced to cede the Cape Colony to the British following a resounding defeat. Renamed after Francis Drake, the newborn Crown Colony of Drakia (later Dominion and finally Domination of the Draka) becomes a haven for displaced American loyalists, Hessian mercenaries, Icelandic refugees, and French royalists fleeing the French Revolution. In an additional divergence Patrick Ferguson is only wounded and not killed at the Battle of Kings Mountain and later moves to Drakia, where he is successful in having the new settlers adopt his Ferguson rifle. 

The new settlers rapidly assimilate the earlier Boer population. With their greater numbers, the higher firepower of the Ferguson rifle, and later augmented by German and Confederate expatriates, they overrun and enslave the native population. With its capital at Archona, the Draka develop into a militaristic slave-owning society controlled by a hereditary plantation slavocracy. Other societal groups include a technocratic subclass of industrialists, a small Boer-dominated navy, and a secret police known as the Security Directorate; controlled by Confederate immigrant families out of “Skull House.”

Draka culture draws heavy inspiration from the Mughal Empire as well as classical antiquity. English is the only legally spoken language, and the Draka accent is described as being difficult for foreigners to imitate, with some Afrikaans influence. The economy is heavily dominated by cartels known as Combines, though there is also a considerable small-business private sector. The Draka currency is gold-backed known as the Auric. 

The majority of the Domination’s free population owns at least one or two slaves. Indeed, subject races are estimated to comprise 90% of the Domination’s population; slaves, or “Serfs,” have no rights and are thus viewed less as living beings and more as expendable fodder, to be used for a variety of purposes. Politically, the Domination is ruled by a parliament of elected senators chosen by the Citizens through a fair vote, which in turn conduct a vote among themselves to appoint an “Archon,” or head of state, who serves for a seven year term. Citizens have a considerable degree of free speech, but any fundamental criticism of the State or the slave system is forbidden. 

While originally, serfs were black Africans and citizenship was open to all white individuals, the Draka eventually began to see themselves as the one true Master Race; all non-Draka existed now as threats to be subjugated. Due to a societal fixation on military training from infancy, Draka citizen soldiers are depicted as being the equal of several elite enemy soldiers in combat; they give no quarter in battle and all prefer death to capture. The rest of the army is filled out by slave troops, known as Janissaries, who are less well-equipped but still formidable. Having leveraged conquered natural resources to offer research grants and incentives, Draka technology is shown to progress more rapidly than technology in reality; their military equipment is several decades ahead of their opponents, and by later books in the series includes genetically modified animals, combat spacecraft, and advanced computer viruses.

Over the course of the 19th century, the Draka conquer and enslave all of Africa, starting with Egypt during the Napoleonic Wars and ending with the Congo. Other world powers are likewise much more expansionist in this timeline, with Brazil seizing much of South America, Gran Colombia never breaking up, and the United States eventually annexing all of North America as well as Spain&#x27;s Caribbean and Pacific possessions. Massive Draka aid to the Confederacy fails to avert a Union victory in the American Civil War. The Taiping Rebellion succeeds, but a weakened China soon cedes large territories and eventually becomes a protectorate of Japan. Joining the Allies of World War I, the Draka seize Ottoman and Bulgarian lands and then much of Central Asia from China, Afghanistan, and the collapsing Russian Empire.

==Plot summary==


The first book of the series, &quot;Marching Through Georgia&quot;, is set during the &quot;Eurasian War.&quot; The Soviet Union, weakened by civil war and overstretched from reinforcing their borders with the Domination, collapses to the Nazi invasion before a Draka attack falls on the German army in the Caucasus. While both sides&#x27; weaponry is somewhat more advanced than in our reality, with jet and rocket aircraft and advanced armored vehicles, that of the Draka proves superior. Since most European countries are loath to unite behind the Germans after the atrocities of the Nazi Party, the Draka are eventually able to conquer all of mainland Europe. Meanwhile, having already subdued what remained of China, Japanese forces are able to concentrate on the United States, seizing its Pacific possessions and raiding North America. The U.S. does not open a second front in Europe and eventually turns the tide against Japan. The Draka invade Japanese-occupied China and Korea, and the war ends in 1945 with multiple German and Japanese cities and bases destroyed by nuclear weapons. The remaining free countries of the world join the Alliance for Democracy, with the United Kingdom inundated with refugees and heavily fortified against any potential Draka attack.

The second book, &quot;Under the Yoke&quot;, depicts Europe under Draka rule. The Draka, having long applied modern science to the practice of slavery, ruthlessly crush any resistance and obliterate old institutions. Their methods even include the use of a thermonuclear weapon on the rebelling city of Barcelona. The third book, &quot;The Stone Dogs&quot;, depicts the cold war between the Draka and the Alliance, known as the Protracted Struggle, which is fought mostly on interplanetary colonies throughout the inner Solar System. The Alliance also intensifies its efforts to recruit Draka defectors, of which there are few.

In the 1970s, the exposure of an Alliance covert operation against a Hindu nationalist party leads to India formally seceding from the Alliance, only to be conquered and enslaved by the Draka within less than a week. Even so, long-term trends are depicted as favoring the Alliance; its larger economy and free population give it an advantage in physics and computer research. Both sides engineer a superweapon for the expected Final War; the Alliance creates a sophisticated computer virus which causes any Draka war machines to self destruct should they go to war-footing, while also secretly constructing a starship known as the &quot;New America&quot;, ready to escape to Alpha Centauri in the event of total defeat. 

The Draka have more advanced biological sciences; by experimenting on slave subjects, Draka geneticists eventually develop a virus known as &quot;The Stone Dogs,&quot; a heavily derived strain of HIV which can induce homicidal madness in those affected, which they infect most of the Alliances leadership with. To prevent losing the virus&#x27;s secrecy following a breach in security, the Domination uses it preemptively on the Alliance in a surprise attack. In the resulting war, costing hundreds of millions of lives on both sides, the Alliance is narrowly defeated; a truce between Draka Archon Eric Von Shrakenberg and Commander Fredrick LaFarge allows the remaining alliance personnel to launch the starship. The Draka conquer the Earth, now devastated by a years-long nuclear winter. All remaining free humans are enslaved or granted limited Draka citizenship, allowing for their children to eventually vote and join the military. 

The Domination eventually imposes “The Final Society,” securing their grip over the solar system. Soon, baseline humans are hunted to extinction by the newly ascendant Homo Drakensis, who then produce a new variant of the species known as Homo Servus that is genetically tailored for servility, as well as unable to breed with the Draka &quot;Master Race.&quot; Only a few isolated groups of baseline humans are said to survive and are kept locked in a Stone Age existence, with their former homelands used as Hunting Preserves by the Draka.

The fourth novel, &quot;Drakon&quot;, starts in 2442 when research into wormhole technology, or “Molehole” technology, needed to bridge the gap between Earth and the Alliance colony of Samothrace at Alpha Centauri, ends up sending a single Drakensis and a pursuing Alliance cyborg into an alternate 1995–2000 where the Draka never existed. In the original timeline, the Draka barely beat back a wormhole-enabled Alliance assault from Alpha Centauri, while in the alternate timeline, the Cyborg manages to prevent the Draka from reopening the wormhole and invading. Using technology captured from the interlopers, the alternate Earth begins to prepare for the next incursion of the Draka.

== Reception ==
De Witt Douglas Kilgore has described the series as an example of a &quot;thought provoking&quot; work from the military science fiction genre.

Fredric Smoler called the series &quot;eerie&quot;, &quot;distressing&quot; and &quot;perhaps the most haunting of dystopian alternate histories&quot;, commending Stirling for his courage to portray a dark, alternative scenario from which others writers may &quot;recoil from&quot;. 

=== Criticism ===

Smoler noted that series has &quot;produced angry rejections of its plausibility, built on too-confident assertions about the impossibility of economically efficient slavery&quot;.

The series has been criticized on the internet for being historically and technologically implausible. When asked about these criticisms in an interview, Stirling answered:

There&#x27;s a small internet industry of &#x27;proving&#x27; that the Domination couldn&#x27;t happen. I consider this a complement . How many people go on at great length trying to prove that vampires and werewolves don&#x27;t exist?

Stirling&#x27;s use of the Draka as point-of-view characters has led to accusations that he has some sympathy with them (for example, in his entry in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot;), to his dismay. He describes the &quot;Draka&quot; series as dystopias based on &quot;suppos[ing that] everything had turned out as &quot;badly&quot; as possible, these last few centuries.&quot;

== Analysis ==
Smoler described the Draka&#x27;s society as populist, racist, hedonistic and post-Christian, and overall, illustrative of &quot;illiberal modernity&quot;. Dennis Showalter described Drakan society as &quot;dystopian&quot;.

In 2000 the series has inspired an Internet website related to the BDSM subculture, a &quot;Master/slave Registry... that enables Masters to register their slaves by number&quot;.

<doc id="205360" wikidata="Q1107953" url="?curid=205360" title="Coldstream Guards">
<text>The Coldstream Guards is the oldest continuously serving regular regiment in the British Army. As part of the Household Division, one of its principal roles is the protection of the monarchy; due to this, it often participates in state ceremonial occasions. The Regiment has consistently provided formations on deployments around the world and has fought in the majority of the major conflicts in which the British Army has been engaged.

The Regiment has been in continuous service and has never been amalgamated. It was formed in 1650 as &#x27;Monck&#x27;s Regiment of Foot&#x27; and was then renamed &#x27;The Lord General&#x27;s Regiment of Foot Guards&#x27; after the Restoration in 1660. With George Monck&#x27;s death in 1670 it was again renamed &#x27;The Coldstream Regiment of Foot Guards&#x27; after the location in Scotland from which it marched to help restore the monarchy in 1660. Its name was again changed to the &#x27;Coldstream Guards&#x27; in 1855 and this is still its present title.

Today, the Regiment consists of: Regimental Headquarters, a single battalion (the 1st Battalion), an independent incremental company (Number 7 Company, maintaining the customs and traditions, as well as carrying the Colours of 2nd Battalion), a Regimental Band, a reserve company (Number 17 Company) and individuals at training establishments and other extra regimental employment.

==History==

===English Civil War===
The origin of the Coldstream Guards lies in the English Civil War when Oliver Cromwell gave Colonel George Monck permission to form his own regiment as part of the New Model Army. Monck took men from the regiments of George Fenwick and Sir Arthur Haselrig, five companies each, and on 13 August 1650 formed Monck&#x27;s Regiment of Foot. Less than two weeks later, this force took part in the Battle of Dunbar, at which the Roundheads defeated the forces of Charles Stuart.

After Richard Cromwell&#x27;s abdication, Monck gave his support to the Stuarts, and on 1 January 1660 he crossed the River Tweed into England at the village of Coldstream, from where he made a five-week march to London. He arrived in London on 2 February and helped in the Restoration of the monarchy. For his help, Monck was given the Order of the Garter and his regiment was assigned to keep order in London. However, the new parliament soon ordered his regiment to be disbanded along with all of the other regiments of the New Model Army.

Before that could happen, Parliament was forced to rely on the help of the regiment against the rebellion by the Fifth Monarchists led by Thomas Venner on 6 January 1661. The regiment defeated the rebels and on 14 February the men of the regiment symbolically laid down their arms as part of the New Model Army and were immediately ordered to take them up again as a royal regiment of The Lord General&#x27;s Regiment of Foot Guards, a part of the Household Troops.

The regiment was placed as the second senior regiment of Household Troops, as it entered the service of the Crown after the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards, but it answered to that by adopting the motto &quot;Nulli Secundus&quot; (&quot;Second to None&quot;) as the regiment is older than the senior regiment. The regiment always stands on the left of the line when on parade with the rest of the Foot Guards, so standing &quot;second to none&quot;. When Monck died in 1670, the Earl of Craven took command of the regiment and it adopted a new name, the Coldstream Regiment of Foot Guards.

===Overseas service (1685–1900)===
The regiment saw active service in Flanders and in the Monmouth Rebellion, including the decisive Battle of Sedgemoor in 1685. It fought in the Battle of Walcourt in 1689, the Battle of Landen and the Siege of Namur.

In 1760, the 2nd Battalion was sent to Germany to campaign under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick and fought in the Battle of Wilhelmstal and at the Castle of Amöneburg. Three Guards companies of 307 men under Coldstream commander Colonel Edward Mathew fought in the American Revolutionary War.

The Coldstream Regiment saw extensive service in the wars against the French Revolution and in the Napoleonic Wars. Under the command of Sir Ralph Abercromby, it defeated French troops in Egypt. In 1807, it took part in the investment of Copenhagen. In January 1809, it sailed to Portugal to join the forces under Sir Arthur Wellesley. In 1814, it took part in the Battle of Bayonne, in France, where a cemetery keeps their memory. The 2nd Battalion joined the Walcheren Expedition. Later, it served as part of the 2nd Guards Brigade in the Chateau Hougoumont where they resisted French assaults all day during the Battle of Waterloo. This defence is considered one of the greatest achievements of the regiment, and an annual ceremony of &quot;Hanging the Brick&quot; is performed each year in the Sergeants&#x27; Mess to commemorate the efforts of Cpl James Graham and Lt-Col James Macdonnell, who shut the North Gate after a French attack. The Duke of Wellington himself declared after the battle that &quot;the success of the battle turned upon closing the gates at Hougoumont&quot;.

The regiment was later part of the British occupation forces of Paris until 1816.

During the Crimean War, the Coldstream Regiment fought in the battles of Alma, Inkerman and Sevastopol. On its return, four men of the regiment were awarded the newly instituted Victoria Cross.

The regiment received its current name, the Coldstream Guards, in 1855. In 1882, it was sent to Egypt against the rebels of Ahmed &#x27;Urabi and in 1885 in the Suakin Campaign. In 1897, the Coldstreamers were reinforced with the addition of a 3rd battalion. The 1st and 2nd battalions were dispatched to South Africa at the outbreak of the Second Boer War. During the conflict, they would prove instrumental at the Battle of Belmont, and were also present at Graspan, Modder River, Magersfontein, Driefontein, Diamond Hill, Belfast, and were also involved in hunting Christiaan de Wet.
===1900–present===
At the outbreak of the First World War, the Coldstream Guards was among the first British regiments to arrive in France after Britain declared war on Germany. In the following battles, it suffered heavy losses, in two cases losing all of its officers. At the First Battle of Ypres, the 1st battalion was virtually annihilated: by 1 November down to 150 men and the Lt Quartermaster. The regiment fought at Mons, Loos, the Somme, Ginchy and in the 3rd Battle of Ypres. The regiment also formed the 4th (Pioneer) Battalion, which was disbanded after the war, in 1919. The 5th Reserve battalion never left Britain before it was disbanded.

When the Second World War began, the 1st and 2nd battalions of the Coldstream Guards were part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France; whilst the 3rd Battalion was on overseas service in the Middle East. Additional 4th and 5th battalions were also formed for the duration of the war. They fought extensively, as part of the Guards Armoured Division, in North Africa and Europe as dismounted infantry. The 4th battalion first became a motorized battalion in 1940 and then an armoured battalion in 1943.

Coldstreamers gave up their tanks at the end of the war, the new battalions were disbanded, and the troops distributed to the 1st and 2nd Guard Training Battalions.

After the war, the 1st and 3rd battalions served in Palestine. The 2nd battalion served in the Malayan Emergency. The 3rd battalion was placed in suspended animation in 1959. The remaining battalions served during the Mau Mau rebellion from 1959 to 1962, in Aden in 1964, in Mauritius in 1965, in the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 and several times in Northern Ireland after 1969.

The Regimental Band of the Coldstream Guards was the first act on stage at the Wembley leg of the 1985 Live Aid charity concert. It played for the Prince and Princess of Wales.

In 1991, the 1st battalion was dispatched to the first Gulf War, where it was involved in prisoner of war handling and other roles. In 1993, due to defence cutbacks, the 2nd battalion was placed in suspended animation.

For much of the 1990s, the 1st Battalion was stationed in Münster, Germany, in the Armoured Infantry Role with Warrior APCs as part of the 4th Armoured Brigade. In 1993–1994, the battalion served as an armoured infantry battalion in peacekeeping duties in Bosnia as part of UNPROFOR.

The battalion was posted to Derry, Northern Ireland, on a two-year deployment in 2001. It then deployed to Iraq in April 2005 for a six-month tour with the rest of 12th Mechanised Brigade, based in the south of the country. The battalion lost two of its soldiers, on 2 May, near Al Amarah and on 18 October at Basra.

Des Browne, Secretary of State for Defence, announced on 19 July 2007 that in October 2007 the battalion was to be sent to Afghanistan as part of 52 Infantry Brigade.

In October 2009, the battalion was deployed on Operation Herrick 11, with units deploying to the Babaji area of central Helmand Province, Afghanistan, playing a major role in Operation Moshtarak in February 2010.

Before the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010 the battalion was part of the 12th Mechanised Brigade in a light infantry role. Under Army 2020 it transferred to London District as a public duties battalion, then in 2019 it joined the 11th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters South East. It will move to 4 Light Brigade Combat Team by 2025.

==Regiment ==
=== Structure ===
The structure of the regiment and affiliated band includes:

* Regimental Headquarters, at Wellington Barracks, London
* 1st Battalion, at Victoria Barracks, Windsor (Light Infantry part of 11th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters South East)
** Battalion Headquarters
** Headquarters Company
** No. 1 Company (Senior Company)
** No. 2 Company
** No. 3 Company
** Support (No. 4) Company (includes Corps of Drums)
* No. 7 Company, based at Wellington Barracks, London (maintaining the traditions and colours of the old 2nd Battalion placed in suspended animation in 1993)
* No. 17 Company, based at Hammersmith (the regiment&#x27;s reserve unit, administered as part of 1st Battalion, London Guards).
* Band of the Coldstream Guards, based at Wellington Barracks, London, part of the Royal Corps of Army Music.

Companies that make up the regiment are traditionally numbered. New officers destined for the regiment that are at Sandhurst or at the Infantry Battle School form No. 13 Coy, while Guardsmen under training at ITC Catterick make up No. 14 Coy. No. 7 Coy is one of the incremental companies formed to undertake public duties in London and Windsor, and maintains the Colours and traditions of the former 2nd Battalion.

==Role==

Currently, the most prominent role of the 1st Battalion and No. 7 Company is the performance of ceremonial duties in London and Windsor as part of the Household Division. The 1st Battalion is based in Windsor at Victoria Barracks as an operational light infantry battalion.

In 2027 the 1st Battalion will take over a security force assistance role from 1st Battalion Irish Guards.

The Corps of Drums, in addition to their ceremonial role, which has been primarily the musical accompaniment of Changing of the Guard for Windsor Castle, has the role of machine gun platoon. All Guardsmen for public duties wear the &#x27;Home Service&#x27; Dress tunic in summer or greatcoat in winter and bearskin with a red plume. The Band of the Coldstream Guards plays at Changing of The Guard, state visits and many other events.

Unlike the other four regiments of foot guards, which recruit from each of the four home nations, the Coldstream Guards has a specific recruiting area, which encompasses the counties that Monck&#x27;s Regiment passed through on its march from Coldstream to London. The traditional recruiting area of the Coldstream Guards is the South West and North East of England.

The Coldstream Guards and other Guards Regiments have a long-standing connection to The Parachute Regiment. Guardsmen who have completed P Company have the option of being posted to the Guards Parachute Platoon, 3 PARA, still keeping the tradition of the No. 1 (Guards) Independent Parachute Company, which was the original Pathfinder Group of 16th Parachute Brigade, now renamed 16th Air Assault Brigade.

==Traditions==
The grouping of buttons on the tunic is a common way to distinguish between the regiments of Foot Guards. Coldstream buttons are arranged in pairs, and a Star of the Garter is marked on their brassware. The Coldstream Guards can also be distinguished from the other Foot Guards by the presence of a red plume (hackle) on the right side of their bearskins.

The regiment is ranked second in the order of precedence, behind the Grenadier Guards. The regiment have the motto &quot;Nulli Secundus&quot; (Second to None), which is a play on the fact that the regiment was originally the &quot;Second Regiment of Foot Guards&quot;, a position they have never accepted as the regiment is older than the Grenadier Guards.

The regiment&#x27;s nickname is Lilywhites. An ordinary soldier of the regiment is called a Guardsman, a designation granted by King George V after the First World War. The regiment is always referred to as the Coldstream, never as the Coldstreams; likewise, a member of the regiment is referred to as a Coldstreamer.

==Training==
Recruits to the Guards Division go through an intensive training programme at the British Army&#x27;s Infantry Training Centre (ITC). Their training is two weeks longer than the programme provided for recruits to the Regular line infantry regiments of the British Army; the extra training, carried out throughout the course, is devoted to drill and ceremonies.

==Colonels-in-Chief==
King Edward VII assumed the colonelcy-in-chief of the regiment on his accession, and subsequent monarchs have also been colonel-in-chief.

* 1901–1910: King Edward VII
* 1915–1936: King George V
* Jan 1936–Dec 1936: King Edward VIII

<text>Spanish omelette or Spanish tortilla is a traditional dish from Spain. It is celebrated as one of the most popular dishes of the Spanish cuisine. It is an omelette made with eggs and potatoes, usually including onion. It is often served at room temperature as a tapa.

It is commonly known in Spanish-speaking countries as , , or .

== History ==
The first reference to the tortilla in Spanish is found in a Navarrese document, as an anonymous &quot;mousehole memorial&quot; addressed to the court of Navarre in 1817. It explains the sparse conditions of Navarre&#x27;s farmers in contrast with those in Pamplona (the capital) and la Ribera (in southern Navarre). After listing the sparse food eaten by highlanders, the next quote follows: &quot;…two to three eggs in tortilla for 5 or 6 [people] as our women know how to make it big and thick with fewer eggs, mixing potatoes, breadcrumbs or whatever.&quot;

According to legend, during the siege of Bilbao, Carlist general Tomás de Zumalacárregui invented the &quot;tortilla de patatas&quot; as an easy, fast and nutritious dish to satisfy the scarcities of the Carlist army. Although it remains unknown whether this is true, it appears the tortilla started to spread during the early Carlist Wars.

Another tale is that the recipe was learnt by Spanish prisoners captured after the Battle of Montes Claros during the Portuguese Restoration War in 1665. After the Portuguese victory, more than 6,000 Spanish soldiers were kept in captivity for three years until the 1668 Treaty of Lisbon was signed. Upon their release, these prisoners brought part of the culture of Alentejo to Spain, including many recipes, which featured a potato egg pie that evolved into the modern version of &quot;tortilla&quot;.

==Nomenclature==
The word &quot;tortilla&quot;, which is the diminutive form of &quot;torta&quot;, literally means &#x27;small cake&#x27;. In European Spanish and in some variants of Latin American Spanish, it means omelette. A potato omelette is a &quot;tortilla de patatas&quot; or &quot;papas.&quot;

As the dish has gained international popularity, and perhaps to distinguish it from the thin flatbread made out of wheat or maize popular in Mexico and Central America, the &quot;española&quot; or Spanish naming gained traction. As such, &#x27;Spanish omelette&#x27; or &#x27;Spanish tortilla&#x27; are its common names in English, while &quot;tortilla española&quot; is the formally accepted name even within the peninsula. In Spain, an omelette (made simply of beaten eggs) is known as &quot;tortilla francesa&quot; () to distinguish it from the potato version.

==Consumption and traditional recipe==
The Spanish omelette is widely available in Spain, and prepared in some Spanish-speaking countries.

The two main options are either with or without onion. The addition of onion is the cause of an unresolved dispute, pitting &quot;concebollistas&quot; (the &quot;with onion&quot; group) against &quot;sincebollistas&quot; (the &quot;without onion&quot; group, considering this to be authentic). It may be related to the tenderness of the local varieties of potato. Restaurateurs are expected to say whether their tortilla has onion, and industrial producers market both options.

The most common way to cook a Spanish omelette is as follows:

* The potatoes, ideally a starchy variety, are cut into thin slices or small dice.
* They are then seasoned and simmered in vegetable oil, traditionally olive oil, with sliced onions added at this stage if used. These ingredients are stirred at a moderate temperature until they are soft but not brown.
* The potatoes, and onions, if included, are then drained and mixed with whisked eggs.
* This mixture is then returned to the pan and slowly cooked.
* Once the eggs are cooked on one side, the omelette is turned over to cook the other side, often using a plate placed over the mixture so the pan can be inverted.

The omelette may be eaten hot, at room temperature, or chilled; it is commonly served, cut into bite-size pieces (&quot;pincho de tortilla&quot;), as a &quot;tapa&quot;, or cut into wedges.

== Tortilla Day ==
&quot;Día de la Tortilla&quot; (&quot;Tortilla Day&quot;) is a popular festivity celebrated in many towns in southern and western Spain. Its date varies depending on the town; however, it normally coincides with the Thursday before Lent, the first day of Carnival, also known as &quot;Jueves lardero&quot; (Fat Thursday). Many towns in eastern Spain have a similar celebration on that day. Traditionally, the inhabitants of each town go to a nearby rural area where they spend the day among family members and friends, eating Spanish tortillas and other foods, and playing games.

<text>Snoring is the vibration of respiratory structures and the resulting sound due to obstructed air movement during breathing while sleeping. The sound may be soft or loud and unpleasant. Snoring during sleep may be a sign, or first alarm, of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Research suggests that snoring is one of the factors of sleep deprivation.
==Causes==
Snoring is the result of the relaxation of the uvula and soft palate. These tissues can relax enough to partially block the airway, resulting in irregular airflow and vibrations. Snoring can be attributed to one or more of the following:

* Genetic predisposition, a proportion of which may be mediated through other heritable lifestyle factors such as body mass index, smoking and alcohol consumption.
*Throat weakness, causing the throat to close during sleep.
* Mispositioned jaw, often caused by tension in the muscles.
* Obesity that has caused fat to gather in and around the throat.
* Obstruction in the nasal passageway.
* Obstructive sleep apnea.
* Sleep deprivation.
* Relaxants such as alcohol or other drugs relaxing throat muscles.
* Sleeping on one&#x27;s back, which may result in the tongue dropping to the back of the mouth.
* Mouth breathing

==Possible consequences==
Snoring is known to cause sleep deprivation to snorers and those around them, as well as daytime drowsiness, irritability, lack of focus and decreased libido. It has also been suggested that it can cause significant psychological and social damage to those affected. A 2008 study shows a positive correlation between loud snoring and the risk of heart attack (about +34% chance) and stroke (about +67% chance). A 2021 meta-analysis reports up to a 46% increased risk of stroke.

Though snoring is often considered a minor condition, snorers can sometimes experience severe impairment of lifestyle. The between-subjects trial by Armstrong &quot;et al.&quot; discovered a statistically significant improvement in marital relations after snoring was surgically corrected. This was confirmed by evidence from Gall et al., Cartwright and Knight and Fitzpatrick et al.

Studies have associated loud snoring with the development of carotid artery atherosclerosis. Amatoury &quot;et al.&quot; demonstrated that snoring vibrations are transmitted to the carotid artery, identifying a possible mechanism for snoring-associated carotid artery damage and atherosclerotic plaque development. These researchers also found amplification of the snoring energy within the carotid lumen at certain frequencies, adding to this scenario. Vibration of the carotid artery with snoring also lends itself as a potential mechanism for atherosclerotic plaque rupture and consequently ischemic stroke. Researchers also hypothesize that loud snoring could create turbulence in carotid artery blood flow. Generally speaking, increased turbulence irritates blood cells and has previously been implicated as a cause of atherosclerosis. While there is plausibility and initial evidence to support snoring as an independent source of carotid artery/cardiovascular disease, additional research is required to further clarify this hypothesis.

==Treatment==
So far, there is no certain treatment that can completely stop snoring. Almost all treatments for snoring revolve around lessening the breathing discomfort by clearing the blockage in the air passage. Medications are usually not helpful in treating snoring symptoms, though they can help control some of the underlying causes such as nasal congestion and allergic reactions. Doctors, therefore, often recommend lifestyle changes as a first-line treatment to stop snoring. This is the reason snorers are advised to lose weight (to stop fat from pressing on the throat), stop smoking (smoking weakens and clogs the throat), avoid alcohol and sedative medications before bedtime (they relax the throat and tongue muscles, which in turn narrow the airways) and sleep on their side (to prevent the tongue from blocking the throat).

A number of other treatment options are also used to stop snoring. These range from over-the-counter aids such as nasal sprays, nasal strips or nose clips, lubricating sprays, oral appliances and &quot;anti-snore&quot; clothing and pillows, to unusual activities such as playing the didgeridoo. Many over-the-counter snoring treatments, such as stop-snoring rings or wrist-worn electrical stimulation bands, have no scientific evidence to support their claims.

===Tongue exercises===
Myofunctional therapy, which incorporates oropharyngeal and tongue exercises, reduces snoring in adults based on both subjective questionnaires and objective sleep studies. Snoring intensity was reduced by 51%.

===Orthopedic pillows===
Orthopedic pillows are the least intrusive option for reducing snoring. These pillows are designed to support the head and neck in a way that ensures the jaw stays open and slightly forward. This helps keep the airways unrestricted as possible and in turn leads to a small reduction in snoring.

===Dental appliances===
Specially made dental appliances called mandibular advancement splints, which advance the lower jaw slightly and thereby pull the tongue forward, are a common mode of treatment for snoring. Such appliances have been proven to be effective in reducing snoring and sleep apnea in cases where the apnea is mild to moderate. Mandibular advancement splints are often tolerated much better than CPAP machines.

===Positive airway pressure===
A continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine is often used to control sleep apnea and the snoring associated with it. It is a relatively safe medical treatment. To keep the airway open, a device pumps a controlled stream of air through a flexible hose to a mask worn over the nose, mouth, or both. A CPAP is usually applied through a CPAP mask which is placed over the nose and/or mouth. The air pressure required to keep the airway open is delivered through this and it is attached to a CPAP machine which is like an air compressor.

The air that CPAP delivers is generally &quot;normal air&quot;—not concentrated oxygen. The machine utilizes the air pressure as an &quot;air splint&quot; to keep the airway open. In obstructive sleep apnea, the airway at the rear of the throat is prone to closure.

===Surgery===
Surgery is also available as a method of correcting social snoring. Some procedures, such as uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, attempt to widen the airway by removing tissues in the back of the throat, including the uvula and pharynx. These surgeries are quite invasive, however, and there are risks of adverse side effects. The most dangerous risk is that enough scar tissue could form within the throat as a result of the incisions to make the airway more narrow than it was prior to surgery, diminishing the airspace in the velopharynx. Scarring is an individual trait, so it is difficult for a surgeon to predict how much a person might be predisposed to scarring. Currently, the American Medical Association does not approve of the use of lasers to perform operations on the pharynx or uvula.

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a relatively new surgical treatment for snoring. This treatment applies radiofrequency energy and heat (between 77 °C and 85 °C) to the soft tissue at the back of the throat, such as the soft palate and uvula, causing scarring of the tissue beneath the skin. After healing, this results in stiffening of the treated area. The procedure takes less than one hour, is usually performed on an outpatient basis, and usually requires several treatment sessions. Radiofrequency ablation is frequently effective in reducing the severity of snoring, but often does not eliminate it.

Bipolar radiofrequency ablation, a technique used for coblation tonsillectomy, is also used for the treatment of snoring.

===Pillar procedure===
The pillar procedure is a minimally invasive treatment for snoring and obstructive sleep apnea. In the United States, this procedure was FDA indicated in 2004. During this procedure, three to six+ Dacron (the material used in permanent sutures) strips are inserted into the soft palate, using a modified syringe and local anesthetic. While the procedure was initially approved for the insertion of three &quot;pillars&quot; into the soft palate, it was found that there was a significant dosage response to more pillars, with appropriate candidates. As a result of this outpatient operation, which typically lasts no more than 30 minutes, the soft palate is more rigid, possibly reducing instances of sleep apnea and snoring. This procedure addresses one of the most common causes of snoring and sleep apnea—vibration or collapse of the soft palate (the soft part of the roof of the mouth). If there are other factors contributing to snoring or sleep apnea, such as conditions of the nasal airway or an enlarged tongue, it will likely need to be combined with other treatments to be more effective.

==Epidemiology==
Statistics on snoring are often contradictory, but at least 30% of adults and perhaps as many as 50% of people in some demographics snore. One survey of 5,713 American residents identified habitual snoring in 24% of men and 13.8% of women, rising to 60% of men and 40% of women aged 60 to 65 years; this suggests an increased susceptibility to snoring with age.

An observational study in the UK Biobank estimated that ~37% of 408,317 participants were habitual snorers, and confirmed positive associations with larger body-mass index, lower socio-economic status and more frequent smoking and alcohol consumption.

<doc id="205370" wikidata="Q230497" url="?curid=205370" title="Tariq ibn Ziyad">
<text>Tariq ibn Ziyad ( ; ), also known simply as Tarik in English, was an Umayyad commander who initiated the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula (present-day Spain and Portugal) against the Visigothic Kingdom in 711–718 AD. He led an army and crossed the Strait of Gibraltar from the North African coast, consolidating his troops at what is today known as the Rock of Gibraltar. The name &quot;Gibraltar&quot; is the Spanish derivation of the Arabic name (), meaning &#x27;mountain of Tariq&#x27;, which is named after him.

== Origins ==
Medieval Arabic historians give contradictory data about Ṭāriq&#x27;s origins and ethnicity. Some conclusions about his personality and the circumstances of his entry into al-Andalus are surrounded by uncertainty. The vast majority of modern sources state that Ṭāriq was a Berber &quot;mawla&quot; of Musa ibn Nusayr, the Umayyad governor of Ifriqiya.

According to Ibn Khaldun, Tariq Ibn Ziyad was from a Berber tribe in what is now Algeria. Heinrich Barth mentions that Tariq Ibn Ziyad was a Berber from the tribe of the Ulhassa, a tribe native to the Tafna that currently inhabits the Béni Saf region in Algeria. According to David Nicolle, Tariq Ibn Ziyad is first mentioned in historical records as the governor of Tangier. Additionally, as per David Nicolle, it is traditionally believed that he was born in Wadi Tafna (a region in present day Tlemcen). He had also lived there with his wife prior to his governance of Tangier.

== History ==

According to Ibn Abd al-Hakam (803–871), Musa ibn Nusayr appointed Ṭāriq governor of Tangier after its conquest in 710–711, but an unconquered Visigothic outpost remained nearby at Ceuta, a stronghold commanded by a nobleman named Julian, Count of Ceuta.

After Roderic came to power in Spain, Julian had, as was the custom, sent his daughter, Florinda la Cava, to the court of the Visigothic king for education. It is said that Roderic raped her, and that Julian was so incensed he resolved to have the Muslims bring down the Visigothic Kingdom. Accordingly, he entered into a treaty with Ṭāriq (Mūsā having returned to Qayrawan) to secretly convoy the Muslim army across the Straits of Gibraltar, as he owned a number of merchant ships and had his own forts on the Spanish mainland.

On or about April 26, 711, the army of Ṭāriq Bin Ziyad, composed of recent Berber converts to Islam, was landed on the Iberian peninsula (in what is now Spain) by Julian. They debarked at the foothills of a mountain which was henceforth named after him, Gibraltar (&quot;Jabal Tariq&quot;).

Ṭāriq&#x27;s army contained about 7,000 soldiers, composed largely of Berber stock but also Arab troops. Roderic, to meet the threat of the Umayyads, assembled an army said to number 100,000, though the real number may well have been much lower. Most of the army was commanded by, and loyal to, the sons of Wittiza, whom Roderic had brutally deposed. Ṭāriq won a decisive victory when Roderic was defeated and killed on July 19 at the Battle of Guadalete.

Ṭāriq Bin Ziyad split his army into four divisions, which went on to capture Córdoba under Mughith al-Rumi, Granada, and other places, while he remained at the head of the division which captured Toledo. Afterwards, he continued advancing towards the north, reaching Guadalajara and Astorga. Ṭāriq was &quot;de facto&quot; governor of Hispania until the arrival of Mūsā a year later. Ṭāriq&#x27;s success led Musa to assemble 12,000 (mostly Arab) troops to plan a second invasion. Within a few years, Ṭāriq and Musa had captured two-thirds of the Iberian peninsula from the Visigoths.

Both Ṭāriq and Musa were simultaneously ordered back to Damascus by the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid I in 714, where they spent the rest of their lives. The son of Musa, Abd al-Aziz, who took command of the troops of al-Andalus, was assassinated in 716. In the many Arabic histories written about the conquest of southern Spain, there is a definite division of opinion regarding the relationship between Ṭāriq and Musa bin Nusayr. Some relate episodes of anger and envy on the part of Mūsā that his freedman had conquered an entire country. Others do not mention, or play down, any such bad blood. On the other hand, another early historian, al-Baladhuri, writing in the 9th century, merely states that Mūsā wrote Ṭāriq a &quot;severe letter&quot; and that the two were later reconciled.

== Speech ==
The 16th-century historian Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari, in his &quot;The Breath of Perfume&quot;, attributes a long speech by Ṭāriq to his troops before the Battle of Guadalete.

== Legends and cultural references ==

* Ṭāriq appears in one story of the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; (nights 272-273). He is referenced as having killed the king of the city of Labtayt (probably Toledo), in accordance to a prophesy.

<doc id="205372" wikidata="Q652151" url="?curid=205372" title="Hamerkop">
<text>The hamerkop (Scopus umbretta) is a medium-sized bird. It is the only living species in the genus &quot;Scopus&quot; and the family Scopidae. The species and family was long thought to sit with the Ciconiiformes but is now placed with the Pelecaniformes, and its closest relatives are thought to be the pelicans and the shoebill. The shape of its head with a long bill and crest at the back is reminiscent of a hammer, which has given this species its name after the Afrikaans word for hammerhead. It is a medium-sized waterbird with brown plumage. It is found in mainland Africa, Madagascar and Arabia, living in a wide variety of wetlands, including estuaries, lakesides, fish ponds, riverbanks, and rocky coasts. The hamerkop is a sedentary bird that often shows local movements.

The hamerkop takes a wide range of prey, mostly fish and amphibians, but shrimps, insects and rodents are taken too. Prey is usually hunted in shallow water, either by sight or touch, but the species is adaptable and will take any prey it can. The species is renowned for its enormous nests, several of which are built during the breeding season. Unusually for a wading bird the nest has an internal nesting chamber where the eggs are laid. Both parents incubate the eggs, and raise the chicks.

The species is not globally threatened and is locally abundant in mainland Africa and Madagascar. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as being of least concern.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The hamerkop was first described by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 in his landmark &quot;Ornithologia&quot;, which was published two years after the tenth edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27; &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The species was subsequently described and illustrated by French polymath Comte de Buffon. When the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin revised and expanded Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; in 1788 he included the hamerkop and cited the earlier authors. He placed the species in the genus &quot;Scopus&quot; that had been introduced by Brisson and coined the binomial name &quot;Scopus umbretta&quot;. 

Brisson&#x27;s names for bird genera were widely adopted by the ornithological community despite the fact that he did not use Linnaeus&#x27; binomial system. The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled in 1911 that Brisson&#x27;s genera were available under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, so Brisson is considered to be the genus authority for the hamerkop. The generic name, &quot;Scopus&quot;, is derived from the Ancient Greek for &quot;shadow&quot;. The specific name &quot;umbretta&quot; is modified from the Latin for &quot;umber&quot; or &quot;dark brown&quot;.

The hamerkop is sufficiently distinct to be placed in its own family, although the relationships of this species to other families has been a longstanding mystery. The hamerkop was usually included in the Ciconiiformes, but is now thought to be closer to the Pelecaniformes. Recent studies have found that its closest relatives are the pelicans and shoebill. Although the hamerkop is the only living member of its family, one extinct species is known from the fossil record. &quot;Scopus xenopus&quot; was described by ornithologist Storrs Olson in 1984 based on two bones found in Pliocene deposits from South Africa. &quot;Scopus xenopus&quot; was slightly larger than the hamerkop and Olson speculated based on the shape of the tarsus that the species may have been more aquatic.

The hamerkop is also known as the hammerkop, hammerkopf, hammerhead, hammerhead stork, umbrette, umber bird, tufted umber, or anvilhead.

===Subspecies===
Two subspecies are recognized—the widespread nominate race &quot;S. u. umbretta&quot; and the smaller of West African &quot;S. u. minor&quot;, described by George Latimer Bates in 1931. Two other subspecies have been proposed. &quot;S. u. bannermani&quot; of south-west Kenya is usually lumped with the nominate race. Birds in Madagascar have been suggested to be distinct, in which case they would be placed in the subspecies &quot;S. u. tenuirostris&quot;. That proposed subspecies was described by Austin L. Rand in 1936. It has also been suggested that birds near the Kavango River in Namibia may be distinct, but no formal description has been made.

==Description==

The hamerkop is a medium-sized waterbird, standing high and weighing , although the subspecies &quot;S. u. minor&quot; is smaller. Its plumage is a drab brown with purple iridescence on the back; &quot;S. u. minor&quot; is darker. The tail is faintly barred with darker brown. The sexes are alike and fledglings resemble adults. The bill is long, , and slightly hooked at the end. It resembles the bill of a shoebill, and is quite compressed and thin, particularly at the lower half of the mandible. The bill is brown in young birds, but becomes black by the time a bird fledges. 

The neck and legs are proportionately shorter than those of similar looking Pelecaniformes. The bare parts of the legs are black and the legs are feathered only to the upper part of the tibia. The hamerkop has, for unknown reasons, partially webbed feet. The middle toe is comb-like (pectinated) like a heron&#x27;s. Its tail is short and its wings are big, wide, and round-tipped; it soars well, although it does so less than the shoebill or storks. When it does so, it stretches its neck forward like a stork or ibis, but when it flaps, it coils its neck back something like a heron. Its gait when walking is jerky and rapid, with its head and neck moving back and forth with each step. It may hold its wings out when running for extra stability.

==Distribution and habitat==
The hamerkop occurs in Africa south of the Sahara, Madagascar, and coastal south-west Arabia. It requires shallow water in which to forage, and is found in all wetland habitats, including rivers, streams, seasonal pools, estuaries, reservoirs, marshes, mangroves, irrigated land such as rice paddies, savannahs, and forests. In Tanzania, it has also recently begun to feed on rocky shores. In Arabia, it is found in rocky wadis with running water and trees. Most are sedentary within their territories, which are held by pairs, but some migrate into suitable habitat during the wet season only. The species is very tolerant of humans and readily feeds and breeds in villages and other human-created habitats.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The hamerkop is mostly active during the day, often resting at noon during the heat of the day. They can be somewhat crepuscular, being active around dusk, but are not nocturnal as has sometimes been reported.

===Social behaviour and calls===
The hamerkop is mostly silent when alone, but is fairly vocal when in pairs or in groups. The only call it usually makes when alone is a flight-call, a shrill &quot;nyip&quot; or &quot;kek&quot;. In groups, vocalisations include a range of calls including cackles and nasal rattles. One highly social call is the &quot;yip-purr&quot; call. This call is only made in a social context, when at least three birds, but up to 20 are gathered in a flock. Birds start by giving a number of &quot;yip&quot; calls, eventually giving way to purring notes. This call is made with the neck extended and sometimes accompanied by wing flapping, and becomes more vigorous when larger numbers of birds are present.

Another common social behaviour is &quot;false mounting&quot;, in which one bird stands on top of another and appears to mount it, but they do not copulate. This behaviour has been noted between both mated pairs and unmated birds, and even between members of the same sex and in reversed mountings, where females mount males. Because of this, the behaviour is thought to be social and not related to the pair bond. Dominant birds may signal to subordinates by opening their bills slightly and erecting their crests, but the species is not very aggressive in general towards others of its species. Birds in groups also engage in social allopreening. One bird presents its face of back of the head to the other to be preened.

===Food and feeding===
This species normally feeds alone or in pairs, but also feeds in large flocks sometimes. It is a generalist, although amphibians and fish form the larger part of its diet. The diet also includes shrimp, insects, and rodents. The type of food they take seems to vary by location, with clawed frogs and tadpoles being important parts of the diet in East and Southern Africa and small fish being almost the only prey taken in Mali. Because it is willing to take a wide range of food items and also take very small prey, it is not resource-limited and only feeds for part of the day.

The usual method of hunting is to walk in shallow water looking for prey. Prey is located differently depending on circumstances; if the water is clear, it may hunt by sight, but if the water is very muddy, it probes its open bill into water or mud and shuts it. It may shuffle one foot at a time on the bottom or suddenly open its wings to flush prey out of hiding. Prey caught in mud is shaken before swallowing to clean it, or if available, taken to clearer water to do so. The species also feeds while in flight. A bird flies slowly low over the water with legs dangling and head looking down, then dipping feet down and hovering momentarily when prey is sighted. The prey is then snatched with the bill and swallowed in flight. This method of hunting can be very successful, with one birds catching prey on 27 of 33 attempts during one 45-minute session. It is also opportunistic, and feeds on swarming termites when they conduct their nuptial flights, snatching as many as 47 alates (flying termites) in five minutes.

This species has been recorded foraging for insects flushed by grazing cattle and buffalo, in a manner similar cattle egrets, and has been observed fishing off the backs of hippopotamuses. It has also been recorded feeding in association with banded mongooses; when a band of mongooses began hunting frogs in dried mud at the side of a pool of water a pair of hamerkops attended the feeding group, catching frogs that escaped the mongooses.

===Breeding===

The strangest aspect of hamerkop behaviour is the huge nest, sometimes more than across, and strong enough to support a man&#x27;s weight. When possible, it is built in the fork of a tree, often over water, but if necessary, it is built on a bank, a cliff, a human-built wall or dam, or on the ground. A pair starts by making a platform of sticks held together with mud, then builds walls and a domed roof. A mud-plastered entrance wide in the bottom leads through a tunnel up to long to a nesting chamber big enough for the parents and young. Nests have been recorded to take between 10 and 14 weeks to build, and one researcher estimated that they would require around 8,000 sticks or bunches of grass to complete. Nesting material may still be added by the pair after the nest has been completed and eggs have been laid. Much of the nesting material added after completion is not sticks, but an odd collection of random items including bones, hide, and human waste.
Pairs of hamerkop are compulsive nest builders, constructing three to five nests per year whether they are breeding or not. Both members of the pair build the nest, and the building of nests may have a function in creating or maintaining the pair bond between them. Barn owls and eagle owls may force them out and take over the nests, but when the owls leave, the pair may reuse the nest. Owls may also use abandoned nests, as may snakes, small mammals such as genets, and various birds, and weaver birds, starlings, and pigeons may attach their nests to the outside. A few reports exist of hamerkops nesting close together, including in Uganda, where 639 nests were seen in an area of ; even if each pair had made seven nests, this would mean 80 pairs were nesting in that area. The species is not treated as colonial, as it does not habitually nest close together, but is not thought to be highly territorial, either. Even where pairs have home ranges that are more spread out those home ranges overlap and are the boundaries are poorly defined.

Breeding happens year-round in East Africa, and in the rest of its range, it peaks at different times, with a slight bias towards the dry season. Pairs engage in a breeding display, then copulate on the nest or on the ground nearby. The clutch consists of three to seven eggs which start chalky white, but soon become stained. The eggs measure on average, and weight around , but considerable variation is seen. Egg size varies by season, by the overall size of the clutch, and from bird to bird. Both sexes incubate the eggs, but the female seems to do most of the work. Incubation takes around 30 days from the first egg being laid to hatching, eggs are laid with intervals of one to three days, and they hatch asynchronously.

Both parents feed the young, often leaving them alone for long times. This habit, which is unusual for wading birds, may be made possible because of the thick nest walls. The young hatch covered with grey down. By 17 days after hatching, their head and crest plumage is developed, and in a month, their body plumage. They first leave the nest around 44 to 50 days after hatching, but continue to use the nest for roosting at night until they are two months old.

==Relationship with humans==
Many legends exist about the hamerkop. In some regions, people state that other birds help it build its nest. The ǀXam informants of Wilhelm Bleek said that when a hamerkop flew and called over their camp, they knew that someone close to them had died.

It is known in some cultures as the lightning bird, and the Kalahari Bushmen believe or believed that being hit by lightning resulted from trying to rob a hamerkop&#x27;s nest. They also believe that the inimical god Khauna would not like anyone to kill a hamerkop. According to an old Malagasy belief, anyone who destroys its nest will get leprosy, and a Malagasy poem calls it an &quot;evil bird&quot;. Such beliefs have given the bird some protection. A south African name Njaka meaning &quot;rain doctor&quot; is derived from its habit of calling loudly prior to rain.

Scopus, a database of abstracts and citations for scholarly journal articles, received its name in honour of this bird, as did the journal of the East African Natural History Society, &quot;Scopus&quot;.

<text>The Taunus is a mountain range in Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, located north west of Frankfurt and north of Wiesbaden. The tallest peak in the range is &quot;Großer Feldberg&quot; at 878 m; other notable peaks are &quot;Kleiner Feldberg&quot; (825 m) and &quot;Altkönig&quot; (798 m).

The Taunus range spans the districts of Hochtaunuskreis, Main-Taunus-Kreis, Rheingau-Taunus, Limburg-Weilburg, and Rhein-Lahn. The range is known for its geothermal springs and mineral waters that formerly attracted members of the European aristocracy to its spa towns. The car line Ford Taunus is named after it.

==Location and boundary==
The Taunus is the southeastern part of the Rhenish Slate Mountains. The low mountain range is about 75 km long from southwest to northeast and about 35 km wide across it from northwest to southeast,it covers an area of about 2700 km2. In the west, the Upper Middle Rhine Valley borders the Taunus and separates it from the western Hunsrück. In the north, the valley of the Lahn (Giessen-Koblenzer Lahntal) with the Limburg Basin forms a very sharp scenic border to the northern Westerwald. In the east, the Giessen Basin (southernmost part of the West Hessian Uplands) with Dießenbach and Kleebach border to the north, the Wetterau with Wetter and Nidda to the south of the slate mountains; in the south, the Rheingau and the Main-Taunus foothills form natural borders. The last three landscapes are part of the Rhine-Main lowlands.

On the southern edge are the towns of Rüdesheim am Rhein, Wiesbaden, Hofheim am Taunus and Bad Homburg vor der Höhe at the junctions with the valleys of the Upper Rhine and Main; the towns of Bad Nauheim and Butzbach are on the eastern edge at the junction with the Wetterau; in the north on the Lahn the towns of Wetzlar, Weilburg, Bad Ems and Lahnstein border on the Hintertaunus; in the west in the Middle Rhine is, among other things, Lorch at the seam (each in an anti-clockwise direction).

==Natural structure==
The Taunus is a heterogeneous landscape area, but it is usually quite distinct from the surrounding landscapes and is classified as a main natural area unit group. The natural landscape is divided according to morphology, geological structure, climate and partly by the prevailing vegetation into sub-landscapes that are more uniform in themselves. The cultural landscape, i.e. the natural landscape shaped by man, shows the following structure in terms of land use, the location and distribution of settlements and the course of traffic routes.

In the south are the more wooded and higher parts, namely the Vordertaunus (naturally also called Vortaunus) and the Hohe Taunus (around Taunus main ridge), where in the Feldberg massif the highest heights not only of the Taunus but of the entire Rhenish Slate Mountains are reached. That is why the climate here is rougher than in the upstream landscape areas - it is colder on average, it rains and, in particular, it snows more. The turbulent relief offers little space for settlements and agricultural use. On the mostly shallow and fertile soils, which developed from acidic rock, there is mainly forest here. The Vortaunus is more inconsistent than the main ridge, it is morphologically more fragmented and the bays of the foothills divide it more.

Hintertaunus is the name given to the area north of the Hoher Taunus up to the Lahn valley. The landscape here is lower and less mountainous than in the southern Taunus. Between the valleys, some of which are quite deep, there are pronounced plateaus (leveled areas) with heavy agricultural use. Since mostly only the slopes of the valley are forested, the Hintertaunus is generally more open. The landscape of the Hintertaunus is more inconsistent because of its different elevations. This is clearly evident in the eastern Hintertaunus. Here, for example, there is a high-altitude landscape with dense forest cover, a harsher climate and poor soil in the Pferdskopf-Bergland; but also the Usinger basin, a gently undulating, open basin landscape with fertile soil and a balanced climate.

The Hintertaunus is divided into the Western and Eastern Hintertaunus by the Idstein Depression, which developed in the Idstein–Bad Camberg area. The Idstein depression widens towards the Lahn valley towards the Limburg Basin and is also known as the Goldener Grund in the northern area, probably because agriculture found more favorable conditions here. The relief is gently undulating, the soil is fertile due to the high proportion of loess and the climate is milder due to the basin location.

==Geology and minerals==

The Taunus is geologically divided from south to north into the units Vordertaunus unit (also northern phyllite zone or metamorphic southern edge zone), Taunus ridge unit and Hintertaunus unit. Finally, south of the Lahn, the Taunus natural region has a share in the Lahn trough and the Giessen nappe.

===Vordertaunus===
The Vordertaunus Unit is a narrow zone of weakly metamorphic rocks such as phyllites, greenschists and sericite gneisses.[5] They are appear greenish through chlorite and epidote. The starting products of these rocks were mudstones and volcanic rocks. The rock strata occurring in the Vordertaunus are divided from north to south into the metavolcanic sequence, the Eppstein slate and the Lorsbach slate.

The oldest sedimentary rocks of the Taunus are the phyllites of Bierstadt from the Early Ordovician epoch, known only from a borehole in Wiesbaden, with an age of about 480 million years determined by the evidence of spores. The volcanic rocks of the metavulcanite unit are younger, they could be dated to the Upper Ordovician and Silurian using uranium-lead dating. They are overlaid by the Eppstein slates of the Silurian and the Lower Devonian Lorsbach slates. At the very southern edge and in a small deposit near Mühlbach in the east of the Vordertaunus unit, limestones are exposed that are attributed to the Middle Devonian.

===Taunus crest===
To the north of the Vordertaunus is the Taunuscrest, also known as the High Taunus, which mainly consists of Lower Devonian clastic rocks. It is composed of the stratigraphic sequences &quot;Graue Phyllite&quot;, &quot;Bunte Schiefer&quot;, &quot;Hermeskeilschichten&quot; and &quot;Taunusquarzit&quot;. The Lower Devonian sub-layer only appears in two small outcrops, metavolcanites of the type found in the Anterior Taunus rocks.
The &quot;Graue Phyllite&quot; consist of slates and sandstones. They contain impressions of Upper Silurian brachiopods and corals and were deposited in shallow water. The clay slates of the &quot;Bunte Schiefer&quot; are greenish-grey or strikingly violet in color due to finely distributed hematite. Agnaths (jawless fish) found in the &quot;Bunte Schist&quot; are from the Gedinne (Lochkovian); just like the formation of the rock, they show a deposit of the colorful slate in rivers or lakes. The rocks of the colorful slate are found on the Großer Feldberg, where they were mined in tunnels to extract roofing slate (slate tunnel below the Red Cross). Quartzite sandstones are embedded in them, from which the Brunhildis rock on the summit of the Großer Feldberg consists. The Hermeskeil layers are exposed below the Großer Feldberg and consist of mudstones, weakly consolidated micaceous sandstones and quartzites of the Lower Siegen (Lower Pragian). They are covered by several 100 m thick layers of Taunus quartzite (Middle Siegen, Pragian/Emsian). The very weather-resistant rock forms many summits of the Taunus ridge (Altkönig, Kleiner Feldberg, Glaskopf), but also individual rock elevations (such as the Hohle Stein). The Celtic ring walls and the rubble heap on the &quot;White Wall&quot; on the Altkönig consist of Taunus quartzite. The fractured groundwater of the Taunus quartzite is of local interest for water extraction. They are dammed by the underlying &quot;Hermeskeilschichten&quot; and pumped through groundwater tunnels. Four such groundwater tunnels make a significant contribution to Wiesbaden&#x27;s water supply.

===Hintertaunus===
The largest unit of the Taunus in terms of area, the Hintertaunus unit, is mainly composed of the black rock series of the Hunsrück slate and the Singhofen layers of the lower Ems tier, often greywacke-like sandstones as well as siltstone and claystone. Younger rocks are only exposed here in small occurrences near Usingen and on the very eastern edge of the Hintertaunus in the Oberkleen area. The geology of the Hintertaunus is not as well known as that of the Vortaunus and Hochtaunus in the south or that of the Lahnmulde in the north due to the often monotonous sandy and slate rocks that form only a few continuous reference horizons and provide hardly any index fossils.

The Hunsrück slate refers to a rock facies occurring mainly in the Hunsrück and Hintertaunus, which is composed of pure, mostly black mudstone and embedded sandstone banks and occurs in stratigraphically different positions in the Upper Siegen and in the Ems. The bulk of the Hunsrück Slate is attributed to the &quot;Elm Lower Stage&quot;. It is known for its exceptionally well-preserved fossils and is locally well suited for use as roofing slate. . In the western Hintertaunus, the almost sand-free Hunsrück slate can be easily separated from the sandy rocks of the Singhofen layers, in the east, rocks in the Facies of the Hunsrück slate recede. Transposed volcanic tuffes and ashes, the so-called porphyroides, are integrated into the Singhofen layers, they can be traced in some cases over several tens of kilometers.

The Middle Devonian to Lower Carboniferous of the &quot;Usinger Mulde&quot; is only about 250 m thick and strongly tectonically disturbed, in the Lahnmulde and Dillmulde typical rocks of this time such as Schalstein, Massenkalk and deck diabase absent here. The greywacke occurring here and at other places in the eastern Hintertaunus cannot or can hardly be distinguished from the Carboniferous Kulm greywacke and are considered by some scientists to be the remains of the &#x27; Viewed &#x27;Giessen Ceiling&quot;.
=== Geological structure ===
The strata of the Taunus were formed in the course of the Variscan orogeny foliated, scaled and in the southwest-northeast strike saddles and troughs folded. The folds are predominantly northwestvergent. Widespread to the northwest, the rock series were thrust onto younger ones. Thus, at the fault zone of the Taunuskamm overthrust, the entire length of the southern Taunus nappe-like was thrust over rocks of the Younger Lower Devonian. The overthrust of the Giessen Nappe, which lies flat today, on rocks from the Hintertaunus and the Lahn Mulde is of even greater extent. Their rocks are not otherwise found in the Taunus, they must have been deposited south of the Vortaunus and were thrust at least 25 km over the Taunus and Hintertaunus, possibly significantly more due to large-scale considerations. In addition to the deformation of the layers, these are clearly metamorphic in the Vordertaunus – the latter clearly decreases to the north.

In later uplift phases between the Late Jurassic and the Tertiary, cross-fractures were applied perpendicular to strike. The rift valley of the Idstein Depression divides the Hintertaunus into an eastern and western part, while the Limburg Basin divides the Lahn Mulde as it sinks. Some of the fractures are now filled with quartz. The free-standing rocks of the Eschbacher cliffs near Usingen are such a quartz vein (Härtling) exposed by erosion. This vein, also known as the Usinger quartz vein, can be traced over a length of about 12 km, making it one of the longest German quartz veins after the Bavarian Pfahl.

=== Mineral resources ===
The northwestern part of the Eastern Hintertaunus &quot;(Langhecker Lahntaunus)&quot;, which leads to the Weilburger Lahntalgebiet, belongs geologically to the &quot;Lahnmulde&quot; and is rich in magmatism. of mineral resources from the Middle Devonian such as iron in the form of red ironstone with up to 50 percent iron content, or river ironstone with up to 35% iron, as well as silver ore, roofing slate and diabase. The ore was mined in numerous mines here, as in the Montan area Lahn-Dill area; some have been converted to visitor mines. The Mining that operated from the 17th to the 20th centuries has now ceased. In the eastern Taunus between Idstein in the west and Usingen in the east, from the late Middle Ages to the early 20th century, there was a large number of pits in which there was mining of varying intensity on post-varistic, i.e. only after the varistic orogeny ore veins formed in the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous. The last active lead and silver ore mine, the Heftrich pit with the Hannibal and Hasdrubal tunnels, was closed around 1924. Exploration drilling carried out by the Hessian State Office for Soil Research in the 1980s no longer provided any indication of deposits worth building.

Due to its hardness, the Taunus quartzite was often mined in the past, currently only one quarry near Köppern is in operation. Some limestone and diabase quarries are still in operation in the part of the Lahnmulde that belongs to the Taunus. In addition, there are countless smaller quarries to supply the local population with building blocks.

==History==

The Roman Limes was built across the Taunus. The Saalburg, a restored Roman castellum, now houses a museum.

After the fall of the Limes (in 259/260 AD), the Alamanni settled in the range and for this reason there are some Alemannic cemeteries in the southern foothills of the Taunus (Eschborn). This area of the Taunus became part of the Frankish confederation of Germanic tribes after the Battle of Tolbiac around 500 AD.

Until the late 18th century, the name of the mountain range was simple and completely unspecific “die Höh(e)” (literally the height), and it has been preserved in the place names &quot;Bad Homburg vor der Höhe&quot; and &quot;Rosbach vor der Höhe&quot;. The Latin “Taunus” comes from Tacitus, who wrote in his work Annales about a “castellum in monte tauno”, which probably referred to today’s Friedberg.

In past centuries the Taunus became famous among aristocrats for its therapeutic hot springs.

Certain towns in the area, such as Bad Homburg vor der Höhe with its &quot;Kurpark&quot;, have geothermal spas that were formerly renowned. Other spa towns in the Taunus range are Bad Schwalbach (formerly &quot;Langenschwalbach&quot;) mentioned in documents dating back to the 16th century, Bad Ems, one of the most reputed therapeutic spas in Germany since the 17th century, as well as Bad Weilbach, where a spring reached wide fame for some time. By the 19th century the most famous spa towns in the area were Wiesbaden, Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, Bad Nauheim, and Bad Soden am Taunus.

<doc id="205377" wikidata="Q6538783" url="?curid=205377" title="Li Gong (computer scientist)">
<text>Gong Li (), also known in English as Li Gong, is a Chinese businessman and computer scientist. He is CEO of Linaro, a British software company headquartered in Cambridge, UK, developing systems software for the Arm ecosystem. He was previously the founder and CEO of Acadine Technologies, a systems software company specializing in mobile operating systems for mobile, wearable, and IoT devices. Acadine’s core product H5OS was a web-centric operating system that was primarily based on the open web standard HTML5. It was derived from Firefox OS, whose development Li had overseen as president of Mozilla Corporation.

==Education==

Born and raised in Beijing, Gong obtained B.S./M.S. at Tsinghua University, Beijing, and a PhD at the University of Cambridge, UK, all in computer science.

==Academic achievements==

Li Gong has 22 issued US patents and co-authored three books (published by Addison Wesley and O&#x27;Reilly), many technical articles, and 8 general articles in the science journal Nature. He won the Best Paper Award at the 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, and received the 1994 Leonard G. Abraham Prize given by the IEEE Communications Society for &quot;the most significant contribution to technical literature in the field of interest of the IEEE.&quot;

==Career==

Li Gong started his career as a researcher, primarily in the fields of computer systems, networking, and information security. He was both program chair and general conference chair for ACM CCS, IEEE S&amp;P, and IEEE CSFW. He was associate editor of ACM TISSEC and associate editor-in-chief of IEEE Internet Computing. Before going into the industry, he first worked at Odyssey Research in Ithaca, New York, and later at the Computer Science Laboratory at SRI International in Menlo Park, California. He held visiting positions at Cornell and Stanford and was a guest chair professor at Tsinghua University, Beijing.

In 1996, he joined the JavaSoft division at Sun Microsystems (in Cupertino, California) as chief Java security architect and designed the security architecture of the Java platform. He became a distinguished engineer and later headed engineering for Java Embedded Server and JXTA, and was the founding chair of the Java Expert Group at the international standard organization OSGi and led the OSGi 1.0 specification.

In 2001, he founded the Sun Microsystems Engineering and Research Institute (ERI) in China, where he was general manager and led the team working on Solaris system, browser, OpenOffice and related desktop software research and development.

In 2005, he joined Microsoft as general manager to lead MSN in China and served as vice president of the Microsoft China R&amp;D Group. He led Beijing and Shanghai teams working in many areas across all the services MSN offered — including Messenger, Hotmail, Spaces, Safety, Mobile, Search, Ads platform, and Virtual Earth.

In 2007, Gong joined Mozilla Corporation to found its China subsidiary Mozilla Online Ltd where he was chairman and CEO. Four years later, he founded Mozilla Taiwan and was CEO. Later, he worked in a number of executive roles at Mozilla’s headquarters, including senior vice president of mobile devices, president of Asia operations, chief operating officer, and president.

He left Mozilla in April 2015, and started Acadine Technologies, initially under the name &quot;Gone Fishing&quot;. It was announced on July 15, 2015 that Acadine Technologies received $100M of first-round funding from Tsinghua Unigroup International, a Hong Kong entity controlled by Tsinghua University and the Chinese government. In the same year, Li Gong stated that the company was already seeking a second round of funding from international investors, a main rationale being &quot;to dispel very early the incorrect perception that we are somehow a China-backed company. We are really a pure Silicon Valley-style startup&quot;.

Li participated (as co-founder, investor, and advisor) in a number of startups in the Silicon Valley and in China. He was venture partner and head of the China office for the US venture capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners from 2007 to 2009.

==Awards==

Li was named one of the 2003 China New Economy People by China Internet Weekly and Sina.com, and received the China Open Source Movement Leadership Award in 2003 given by the China Software Industry Association. In 2013 he was named a &quot;China Outstanding Open Source Contributor&quot; by the China Open Source Software Promotion Union, and one of the top 100 managers in China by the Chinese management magazine Manager Today.

He is a long-term member on the board of directors of the Tsinghua University Alumni Association and co-founded Tsinghua Entrepreneur and Executive Club (TEEC) and was the founding Chairman of Beijing chapter of TEEC in 2008.

<doc id="205383" wikidata="Q983263" url="?curid=205383" title="Masuccio Salernitano">
<text>Masuccio Salernitano (1410–1475), bornTommaso Guardati, was an Italian poet.

Born in Salerno or Sorrento, he is best known today for &quot;Il Novellino&quot;, a collection of 50 &quot;novelle&quot; or short stories, each prefaced by a letter of dedication to a famous person and with an epilogue containing the &quot;moral&quot; of the story.

The stories have a strongly anti-clerical bent, which caused &quot;Il Novellino&quot; to be included in the first &quot;Index of Prohibited Books&quot; in 1557.

The 33rd of these stories is the story of &quot;Mariotto and Ganozza&quot;, which was apparently adapted by Luigi da Porto (1485–1529) first as &quot;Giulietta e Romeo&quot; and later as &quot;Historia novellamente ritrovata di due nobili amanti&quot; (&quot;Newly retrieved story of two noble lovers&quot;). These three stories, plus another later version by Matteo Bandello and the English translation by Arthur Brooke in the poem &quot;Tragicall Historye of Romeus and Juliet&quot; (1562) appear to be the sources for Shakespeare&#x27;s famous play &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

<doc id="205384" wikidata="Q16148685" url="?curid=205384" title="V (franchise)">
<text>V is an American science fiction franchise created by American writer, producer and director Kenneth Johnson about a genocidal invading alien race known as the &quot;Visitors&quot;—reptilian humanoids disguised as human beings—trying to take over Earth, and the human reaction to this, including the Resistance group attempting to stop them, while others collaborate with the aliens for power and personal wealth.

The two-part television miniseries &quot;V&quot; aired in 1983, written and directed by Johnson. It had cost US$13 million to produce. It was followed in 1984 by a three-part miniseries, &quot;V: The Final Battle&quot;, and a nineteen-episode weekly television series, &quot;V&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;V: The Series&quot;) during the 1984–85 television season. ABC ran a remake series, produced by Warner Bros. Television, which ran for two seasons totalling 22 episodes from November 3, 2009, to March 15, 2011.

In the original series, the title refers to the &quot;V for Victory&quot; sign. A group of children are shown spray painting generic graffiti over the Visitors&#x27; propaganda posters, but are then shown how to spray the &quot;V&quot; over the posters by Abraham Bernstein, a Holocaust survivor, who explains the meaning of the sign to them as he defaces the first poster. In the 2009 reboot of the series, however, &quot;V&quot; is used within the show as an abbreviation for the Visitors.

A number of novels, comic books, video games and other media have been spun off from the franchise. Johnson&#x27;s novel &quot;V: The Second Generation&quot;, an alternative sequel to the first miniseries which disregards &quot;V: The Final Battle&quot; and &quot;V: The Series&quot; because of his non-involvement with them, was released on February 5, 2008. Johnson stated he was in negotiations for a TV adaptation of his sequel novel, but Warner Bros. opted to do the 2009 remake series instead.

==Television==
* &quot;V&quot; miniseries (1983)
* &quot;V: The Final Battle&quot; sequel miniseries (1984)
* &quot;V&quot; weekly series (1984–1985)
* &quot;V&quot; remake series (2009–2011)

The original miniseries debuted in the United States on NBC on May 1, 1983. Series creator Kenneth Johnson has said that the story was inspired by the 1935 novel &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot; by Sinclair Lewis. In a commentary track on the DVD release of the first miniseries, Johnson reveals that &quot;V&quot; was originally intended as a straightforward political thriller, charting the rise of a fascist movement in the United States. NBC was interested in a sci-fi hit, to capitalize on the success of films such as the &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy.

The miniseries was successful enough to spawn a sequel, &quot;V: The Final Battle&quot;, which was meant to conclude the story, but this led to a further continuation as a weekly television series in 1984–1985. Johnson left the franchise during production of &quot;The Final Battle&quot;. The abrupt cancellation of the weekly TV series in the spring of 1985 meant that the series ended with an unresolved cliffhanger. &quot;V&quot; was remade as a new weekly TV series in 2009, which initially attracted high ratings. However, ratings fell and the remake was cancelled after a brief 10-episode second season, also ending with an unresolved cliffhanger.

==Film attempts==
For many years, Kenneth Johnson tried to resurrect &quot;V&quot; as another television production. When his attempts failed, and Warner Bros (who own the television rights to the property) opted to remake the series instead, Johnson then tried to develop &quot;V&quot; as a feature film. However, his various attempts at this also failed to get off the ground.
On February 6, 2018, the reincarnated Desilu Studios announced that it would be producing a feature film of &quot;V&quot;. The film would be written and directed by Kenneth Johnson, and produced by John Hermansen, Barry Opper, and Johnson. Johnson added &quot;We are delighted to team up with Desilu to bring the timeless—and timely—story of resistance against tyranny into the 21st Century ... V will be the first of a cinematic trilogy which will tell the full epic tale in the manner I always envisioned.&quot; Johnson later updated his site to say that Desilu&#x27;s option has expired, and referred to allegations that the individual helming the new Desilu was defrauding investors. Since then, no further news has surfaced about another &quot;V&quot; production, either for film or television.

==Novels==
===Original series===
&quot;V&quot; spun off a series of original novels. Five were originally planned but the range soon extended beyond these. The first was a novelization of the first two miniseries combined into one story, originally planned as 2 books, Pinnacle later changed its mind during its writing, and decreed that it should be one book (The publishers were then left with the option of another book, this became &quot;East Coast Crisis&quot;) Because the Writers&#x27; Guide was not ready in time for the authors to consult, most of the original novels that followed did not feature characters or continuing storylines from the TV series, but rather focused on battles against the alien invaders in other parts of the world, some were also set during the &quot;unrecorded year&quot; between the end of &quot;The Final Battle&quot; and &quot;Liberation day&quot; to get around this problem.

While the series was on the air, new novels were published once a month by Pinnacle Paperbacks, and in the U.K. every 2 months by New English Library. In 1987–88, the remaining 5 books, left unpublished with the demise of Pinnacle books, were published by Tor. No U.K. publisher was found for these.
===The Second Generation===

Kenneth Johnson—V&#x27;s original creator—had been trying to bring the series back to television as a sequel to the original miniseries that would ignore the second miniseries and all the other subsequent fiction. When Warner Bros. decided to go with a complete reboot instead, Johnson wrote his story as a new novel.

==Factual books==
A number of factual books, covering all aspects of the saga including interviews, articles and episode guides, have been published, most notably the 6 volumes of &quot;The V Files&quot;, written By James Van Hise and Ed Gross, published by New Media Books/Psi Fi movie Press in the mid 1980s, and the two French books, &quot;V: l&#x27;autre guerre des mondes&quot; (V: The Other War of the Worlds) by Francis Valery, first published in paperback in 1993 by DLM editions (and reissued in 1995), covering the entire original saga up to and including, the unfilmed episode #20 &quot;The Attack&quot;, and &quot;V: les miroirs du passe&quot; (V: The Mirrors of the Past), by Didier Liardet, published by Yris Editions in 2011, this paperback features a full episode guide to both the 1980s original and the modern reboot, details the history of the show, and also includes photos of merchandise from the series over the years.

In 2017, a book by Dan Copp entitled &quot;Fascist Lizards from Outer Space: The Politics, Literary Influences and Cultural Impact of Kenneth Johnson&#x27;s V&quot; was published by McFarland &amp; Company.

Also of note is John L. Flynn&#x27;s &quot;Future Threads: Costume Design for the Science Fiction World&quot;, published in 1985 by New Media books, which has instructions and patterns for creating several different Visitor costumes, among others.

==Comics==
DC Comics published an 18-issue &quot;V&quot; comic book series from February 1985 – July 1986, with stories set to be concurrent with the events of &quot;V: The Series&quot;. The editor of the comic reported at one point in the letter (fan mail) column that DC was working to acquire permission to continue the storyline of the television series should it not be renewed for a second season. In the end, either such permission was denied or DC decided not to pursue the matter further. The cover of the 18th issue did state &quot;Final Issue&quot;, but actually featured (with issue 17) a flashback story featuring Elias Taylor. (Issue 16 led into the opening scene of the final television episode.)

In Japan, Go Nagai wrote a manga adaptation of the series with art by Tatsuya Yasuda.

==Computer game==
V is a video game based on the TV series of the same name. It was developed by Ocean Software. The programmer was Grant Harrison.

In the role of Mike Donovan, the player must infiltrate an alien mother-ship, destroy the craft, and escape alive. The opening scene is a docking bay, and the player&#x27;s objectives are to spread the red dust to take out the alien visitors and to set 5 bombs in strategic locations to blow up the mother-ship. The player must solve many puzzles in order to progress and complete the game.

==Audio dramas==
On December 23, 2024, Big Finish Productions announced a new radio drama adaptation of Kenneth Johnson&#x27;s original scripts, with the action now moved to the United Kingdom. The first set of episodes, &quot;V UK: Visitation&quot;, will be released on January 23, 2025 and covers the arrival of the Visitors and the beginning of the human rebellion. The second set, &quot;V UK: Occupation&quot;, is scheduled for release in August 2025. The series stars Jack Myers as Mike Donovan, Annabel Baldwin as Juliet Parrish, and Janie Dee as Diana.

Writer and producer Jonathan Morris commented:
Although &quot;V - UK&quot; has all the trappings of science fiction - motherships, aliens, laser guns - that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s about. It is, pretty blatantly, an allegory for living life under occupation or under a fascist government.

That tyranny will gain power by offering simple solutions and by making scapegoats. And in that situation, you have to ask - what would I do? Would I join the resistance or would I keep my head down for the sake of a quiet life?

My goal, basically, was to make it feel close to home, uncomfortably so, because that&#x27;s the power of the premise. It&#x27;s not about aliens invading a distant world. It&#x27;s about them marching down the street where you live. This is a story set in a world post-Brexit, post COVID-19, and some of the themes from the original miniseries - such as the vilification of scientists - are even more timely now.

<doc id="205385" wikidata="Q2719515" url="?curid=205385" title="Cisticola">
<text>Cisticolas (pronounced &quot;sis-TIC-olas&quot;) are a genus of very small insectivorous birds formerly classified in the Old World warbler family Sylviidae, but now usually considered to be in the separate family Cisticolidae, along with other southern warbler genera. They are believed to be quite closely related to the swallows and martins, the bulbuls and the white-eyes. The genus contains about 50 species, of which only two are not found in Africa: one in Madagascar and the other from Asia to Australasia. They are also sometimes called fantail-warblers due to their habit of conspicuously flicking their tails, or tailor-birds because of their nests.

==Taxonomy==
The genus was erected by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1829. The type species, by tautonymy, is &quot;Sylvia cisticola&quot; Temminck, 1820, now considered as a subspecies of &quot;Sylvia juncidis&quot; Rafinesque 1810, the zitting cisticola. The name &quot;Cisticola&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;kisthos&quot;, &quot;rock-rose&quot;, and Latin &quot;colere&quot;, &quot;to dwell&quot;.

==Range and habitat==
Cisticolas are widespread through the Old World&#x27;s tropical and sub-tropical regions. Africa, which is home to almost all species, is the most likely ancestral home of the group. Cisticolas are usually non-migratory with most species attached to and often distinguishable by their habitats.

A variety of open habitats are occupied. These include wetlands, moist or drier grasslands, open or rocky mountain slopes, and human-modified habitats such as road verges, cultivation, weedy areas or pasture. The species preferring wetlands can be found at the edges of mangrove, or in papyrus, common reed, or typha swamps. Cisticolas are generally quite common within what remains of their preferred habitats.

The zitting cisticola (or fan-tailed warbler) is widespread throughout the tropics and even breeds in southern Europe. It has occurred on a few occasions as a vagrant to England.

==Description==

Because of their small size (about 10 cm) and brown plumage, they are more easily heard than seen. The similar plumage of many species can make them hard to identify, particularly in winter when they seldom emerge from their grasses. Many African species, in particular, are difficult to distinguish other than by their calls. Thirteen species are named for their calls, from &quot;singing&quot; and &quot;chirping&quot; to &quot;bubbling&quot; and &quot;siffling&quot;.

==Behaviour==
Male cisticolas are polygamous. The female builds a discreet nest deep in the grasses, often binding living leaves into the soft fabric of felted plant down, cobweb, and grass: a cup shape for the zitting cisticola with a canopy of tied-together leaves or grasses overhead for camouflage, a full dome for the golden-headed cisticola. The average clutch is about 4 eggs, which take about 2 weeks to hatch. The parasitic weaver is a specialist parasite of cisticolas and prinias.

In summer, male cisticolas of smaller species make spectacular display flights while larger species perch in prominent places to sing lustily. Despite his size and well-camouflaged, brown-streaked plumage, the male golden-headed cisticola of Australia and southern Asia produces a small, brilliant splash of golden-yellow colour in the dappled sunlight of a reed bed.

==List of species==
The genus contains 53 species:

<doc id="205392" wikidata="Q444422" url="?curid=205392" title="Task Force 11">
<text>Task Force 11 (TF 11 or alternately Commander Task Force 11, CTF 11) is a designation that has been used by the United States armed forces for two separate units.

==World War II==
During World War II, Task Force 11 was a United States Navy aircraft carrier task force in the Pacific theater. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Destroyer Squadron 1 was attached to the task force, which was under the command of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, made up of the aircraft carrier and the heavy cruisers , , and . On 14 December 1941, after delays due to bad weather, the task force cleared Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, as a diversion for an expedition under Rear Admiral Frank J. Fletcher in the aircraft carrier to relieve Wake Island.

Originally formed around &quot;Lexington&quot;, TF 11 then was formed around her sister ship &quot;Saratoga&quot; until &quot;Saratoga&quot; was torpedoed and disabled by the Imperial Japanese Navy submarine on 11 January 1942. It then was formed around &quot;Lexington&quot; again for the Battle of the Coral Sea in which &quot;Lexington&quot; was sunk in early May 1942, then again around &quot;Saratoga&quot; after her repairs were completed.

TF 11 – as part of Task Force 61 along with Task Force 16 – was involved in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons in late August 1942, but &quot;Saratoga&quot; was again crippled by a submarine, and the task force shrank to just the carrier and some destroyers.

In September 1943, TF 11 was reorganized around the light aircraft carriers and under Rear Admiral Willis A. Lee and supported landings on Baker Island and Howland Island. In early 1944, its task groups TG 11.1 and 11.2, now consisting of escort carriers, supported operations in the Marshall Islands.

==War on Terrorism==
Task Force 11 was also the first designation given to the United States special operations forces composite grouping which has pursued terrorist high-value targets in Afghanistan and Iraq since October 2001. The grouping has been redesignated multiple times to avoid information leakages. Task Force 11 (seemingly in reference to 11 September) was only the first title used. It also used the title &#x27;Task Force Sword&#x27; at the same time.

Initially it operated under the United States Joint Special Operations Command in Afghanistan searching for senior Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders. The unit included elements from Canada&#x27;s JTF2 as well. JSOC frequently changed the name of the task force, and it has been designated Task Force 6-26, Task Force 121, and Task Force 145 with one of its most recently recorded names being Task Force 88.

<doc id="205393" wikidata="Q17005494" url="?curid=205393" title="Binary classification">
<text>Binary classification is the task of classifying the elements of a set into one of two groups (each called &quot;class&quot;). Typical binary classification problems include:
* Medical testing to determine if a patient has a certain disease or not;
* Quality control in industry, deciding whether a specification has been met;
* In information retrieval, deciding whether a page should be in the result set of a search or not
* In administration, deciding whether someone should be issued with a driving licence or not
* In cognition, deciding whether an object is food or not food.

When measuring the accuracy of a binary classifier, the simplest way is to count the errors. But in the real world often one of the two classes is more important, so that the number of both of the different types of errors is of interest. For example, in medical testing, detecting a disease when it is not present (a &quot;false positive&quot;) is considered differently from not detecting a disease when it is present (a &quot;false negative&quot;).

==Four outcomes==

Given a classification of a specific data set, there are four basic combinations of actual data category and assigned category: true positives TP (correct positive assignments), true negatives TN (correct negative assignments), false positives FP (incorrect positive assignments), and false negatives FN (incorrect negative assignments).
These can be arranged into a 2×2 contingency table, with rows corresponding to actual value – condition positive or condition negative – and columns corresponding to classification value – test outcome positive or test outcome negative.

==Evaluation==
From tallies of the four basic outcomes, there are many approaches that can be used to measure the accuracy of a classifier or predictor. Different fields have different preferences. 

===The eight basic ratios===
A common approach to evaluation is to begin by computing two ratios of a standard pattern. There are eight basic ratios of this form that one can compute from the contingency table, which come in four complementary pairs (each pair summing to 1). These are obtained by dividing each of the four numbers by the sum of its row or column, yielding eight numbers, which can be referred to generically in the form &quot;true positive row ratio&quot; or &quot;false negative column ratio&quot;. 

There are thus two pairs of column ratios and two pairs of row ratios, and one can summarize these with four numbers by choosing one ratio from each pair – the other four numbers are the complements.

The row ratios are:
*true positive rate (TPR) = (TP/(TP+FN)), aka sensitivity or recall. These are the proportion of the &quot;population with the condition&quot; for which the test is correct.
**with complement the false negative rate (FNR) = (FN/(TP+FN))
*true negative rate (TNR) = (TN/(TN+FP), aka specificity (SPC),
**with complement false positive rate (FPR) = (FP/(TN+FP)), also called independent of prevalence

The column ratios are:
*positive predictive value (PPV, aka precision) (TP/(TP+FP)). These are the proportion of the &quot;population with a given test result&quot; for which the test is correct.
**with complement the false discovery rate (FDR) (FP/(TP+FP))
*negative predictive value (NPV) (TN/(TN+FN))
**with complement the false omission rate (FOR) (FN/(TN+FN)), also called dependence on prevalence.

In diagnostic testing, the main ratios used are the true column ratios – true positive rate and true negative rate – where they are known as sensitivity and specificity. In informational retrieval, the main ratios are the true positive ratios (row and column) – positive predictive value and true positive rate – where they are known as precision and recall. 

Cullerne Bown has suggested a flow chart for determining which pair of indicators should be used when. Otherwise, there is no general rule for deciding. There is also no general agreement on how the pair of indicators should be used to decide on concrete questions, such as when to prefer one classifier over another.

One can take ratios of a complementary pair of ratios, yielding four likelihood ratios (two column ratio of ratios, two row ratio of ratios). This is primarily done for the column (condition) ratios, yielding likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing. Taking the ratio of one of these groups of ratios yields a final ratio, the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). This can also be defined directly as (TP×TN)/(FP×FN) = (TP/FN)/(FP/TN); this has a useful interpretation – as an odds ratio – and is prevalence-independent.

===Other metrics===

There are a number of other metrics, most simply the accuracy or Fraction Correct (FC), which measures the fraction of all instances that are correctly categorized; the complement is the Fraction Incorrect (FiC). The F-score combines precision and recall into one number via a choice of weighing, most simply equal weighing, as the balanced F-score (F1 score). Some metrics come from regression coefficients: the markedness and the informedness, and their geometric mean, the Matthews correlation coefficient. Other metrics include Youden&#x27;s J statistic, the uncertainty coefficient, the phi coefficient, and Cohen&#x27;s kappa.

==Statistical binary classification==
Statistical classification is a problem studied in machine learning in which the classification is performed on the basis of a classification rule. It is a type of supervised learning, a method of machine learning where the categories are predefined, and is used to categorize new probabilistic observations into said categories. When there are only two categories the problem is known as statistical binary classification.

Some of the methods commonly used for binary classification are:
* Decision trees
* Random forests
* Bayesian networks
* Support vector machines
* Neural networks
* Logistic regression
* Probit model
* Genetic Programming
* Multi expression programming
* Linear genetic programming

Each classifier is best in only a select domain based upon the number of observations, the dimensionality of the feature vector, the noise in the data and many other factors. For example, random forests perform better than SVM classifiers for 3D point clouds.

==Converting continuous values to binary==
Binary classification may be a form of dichotomization in which a continuous function is transformed into a binary variable. Tests whose results are of continuous values, such as most blood values, can artificially be made binary by defining a cutoff value, with test results being designated as positive or negative depending on whether the resultant value is higher or lower than the cutoff.

However, such conversion causes a loss of information, as the resultant binary classification does not tell &quot;how much&quot; above or below the cutoff a value is. As a result, when converting a continuous value that is close to the cutoff to a binary one, the resultant positive or negative predictive value is generally higher than the predictive value given directly from the continuous value. In such cases, the designation of the test of being either positive or negative gives the appearance of an inappropriately high certainty, while the value is in fact in an interval of uncertainty. For example, with the urine concentration of hCG as a continuous value, a urine pregnancy test that measured 52 mIU/ml of hCG may show as &quot;positive&quot; with 50 mIU/ml as cutoff, but is in fact in an interval of uncertainty, which may be apparent only by knowing the original continuous value. On the other hand, a test result very far from the cutoff generally has a resultant positive or negative predictive value that is lower than the predictive value given from the continuous value. For example, a urine hCG value of 200,000 mIU/ml confers a very high probability of pregnancy, but conversion to binary values results in that it shows just as &quot;positive&quot; as the one of 52 mIU/ml.

<text>A task force (TF) is a unit or formation established to work on a single defined task or activity. Originally introduced by the United States Navy, the term has now caught on for general usage and is a standard part of NATO terminology. Many non-military organizations now create &quot;task forces&quot; or task groups for temporary activities that might have once been performed by &quot;ad hoc (designated purpose)&quot; committees. In non-military contexts, working groups are sometimes called task forces.

==Military==

===Naval===
===Army===
In the U.S. Army, a task force is a battalion-sized (usually, although there are variations in size) &quot;ad hoc&quot; unit formed by attaching smaller elements of other units. A company-sized unit with an armored or mechanized infantry unit attached is called a &quot;company team&quot;. A similar unit at the brigade level is called a &quot;brigade combat team&quot; (BCT), and there is also a similar &quot;Regimental combat team&quot; (RCT).

In the British Army and the armies of other Commonwealth countries, such units are traditionally known as battlegroups.

The 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) was a brigade-sized formation which commanded Australian and New Zealand Army units deployed to South Vietnam between 1966 and 1972. More recently, Australian task forces have been designated to cover temporary support elements such the battalion-sized force which operated in Urozgan Province, Afghanistan from 2006 to 2013, and the Northern Territory Emergency Response Task Force.

===Other data regarding military US task forces===
* Some task forces are named after their commander, such as Dunsterforce.
* Task Force Tarawa, the name given the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade during the 2003 invasion of Iraq Operation Iraqi Freedom. They were a Marine Air-Ground Task Force commanded by Brigadier General Richard Natonski, attached to the I Marine Expeditionary Force.
* Task Force Leatherneck is the name given the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade during their 2009 operations in Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. They are a Marine Air-Ground Task Force commanded by Brigadier General Larry Nicholson, assigned to work under the International Security Assistance Force.
* US Army Task Force Lethal is the name for 2-12 Infantry battalion out of Fort Carson, Colorado. Part of the Army&#x27;s 4th Infantry Division, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment Task Force Lethal. Some of the heaviest firefights US troops were engaged in were in the Kunar province by teams of Task Force Lethal, there to replace members of the 173rd Airborne units and their outpost Restrepo. Task Force Lethal is assigned to work as part of the International Security Assistance Force. Task Force Lethal prides itself as one of the Army&#x27;s premier multi-task light Infantry units that has trained at home in the mountainous regions of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado and excels at high altitude warfare. The commandos of Task Force Lethal have remained one of the US Army&#x27;s most elite task forces in the global War on Terror since the start in 2003.
* Task Force 1-41 Infantry was a U.S. Army heavy battalion task force which took part in the Gulf War of January–March 1991. Task Force 1-41 Infantry was the first coalition force to breach the Saudi Arabian border on 15 February 1991 and conduct ground combat operations in Iraq engaging in direct and indirect fire fights with the enemy on 17 February 1991. It consisted primarily of the 1st Battalion, 41st Infantry Regiment, 3rd Battalion, 66th Armor Regiment, and the 4th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment, all being part of the 2nd Armored Division (Forward), based at Lucius D. Clay Kaserne, 24 kilometres (15 mi) north of Bremen, in the Federal Republic of Germany.

==Government==

In government or business a task force is a temporary organization created to solve a particular problem. It is considered to be a more formal &quot;ad hoc&quot; committee.
A taskforce, or more commonly, task force, is a special committee, usually of experts, formed expressly for the purpose of studying a particular problem. The task force usually performs some sort of an audit to assess the current situation, then draws up a list of all the current problems present and evaluates which ones merit fixing and which ones are actually fixable. The task force would then formulate a set of solutions to the problems and pick the &quot;best&quot; solution to each problem, as determined by some set of standards. For example, a task force set up to eliminate excessive government spending might consider a &quot;best&quot; solution to be one that saves the most money. Normally, the task force then presents its findings and proposed solutions to the institution that called for its formation; it is then up to the institution itself to actually act upon the task force&#x27;s recommendations.

== Business ==
In business, task forces are initiated similar to military situations to form an ad hoc group of persons that focus on a specific subject, which needs urgent addressing, resolutions or results. Subject-specific task forces are very common. NASA lessons contain information from different task forces.

<text>Franz Xaver Messerschmidt (February 6, 1736 – August 19, 1783) was a German-Austrian sculptor most famous for his &quot;character heads&quot;, a collection of busts with faces contorted in extreme facial expressions.

==Early years==
Born February 6, 1736, in the southwestern town of thence Bavarian Wiesensteig, located in the region of (now) Baden-Württemberg in Germany. Messerschmidt grew up in the Munich home of his uncle, the sculptor Johann Baptist Straub, who became his first master. He spent two years in Graz, in the workshop of his other maternal uncle, the sculptor Philipp Jakob Straub. At the end of 1755 he matriculated at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, and became a pupil of Jacob Schletterer. Graduated, he got work at the imperial arms collection. Here, in the building&#x27;s salon in 1760-63 he made his first known works of art, the bronze busts of the imperial couple and reliefs representing the heir of the crown and his wife. With these works he joined the Late Baroque art of courtly representation, which was under the determining influence of Balthasar Ferdinand Moll. To this trend belong two other, larger than lifesize tin statues representing the imperial couple, commissioned by Maria Theresa of Austria and executed between 1764 and 1766. Besides some other portraits he also made works with a religious subject. A number of statues commissioned by the Princess of Savoy have survived as well.

==Maturity==

The Baroque period of his oeuvre ended in 1769 with a bust of the court physician Gerard van Swieten, commissioned by the Empress. At the same time his first early Neo-Classic works appeared, made—characteristically—for the academy. To these and later works he applied many experiences gained in 1765 during a study trip to Rome. One of these early, severe heads from the years 1769–70, influenced by Roman republican portraits, represents the well-known doctor Franz Anton Mesmer. At about the same time, in 1770-72 Messerschmidt began to work on his so-called character heads, which were - as has been much later proposed (notably by Ernst Kris) - connected with certain paranoid ideas and hallucinations from which, at the beginning of the seventies, the master supposedly began to suffer. Messerschmidt found himself increasingly at odds with his aspirations. His material situation worsened to such an extent, that in 1774, when he applied for the newly-vacant office of a leading professor at the academy, where he had been teaching since 1769, instead of getting it he was expelled from teaching. In a letter to the Empress, Count Kaunitz praised Messerschmidt&#x27;s abilities, but suggested that the nature of his illness (referred to as a &quot;confusion in the head&quot;) would make such an appointment detrimental to the institution.

It is later suggested he suffered from Crohn&#x27;s disease, chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that may provoke pains severe enough to cause hallucinations.

==Later years==

Bitter, he left Vienna, moving to his native village, Wiesensteig, and from there in the same year, following an invitation, to Munich. Here he waited two years for a promised commission and for a permanent employment at the Court. In 1777 he went to Pressburg (now Bratislava) where his brother, Johann Adam worked as a sculptor. He spent the last six years of his life there. Being able to rebuild his career and to buy a house with a studio, he dedicated himself primarily to his character heads.

== Character heads (&quot;Charakterköpfe&quot; ) ==
In 1781, German author Friedrich Nicolai—known for his polemicist and satirical approach—visited Messerschmidt at his studio in Pressburg and subsequently published a transcript of their conversation. Nicolai&#x27;s account of the meeting is a valuable resource, as it is the only contemporary document that details Messerschmidt&#x27;s reasoning behind the execution of his character heads. Messerschmidt devised a series of pinches he administered to his right lower rib. Observing the resulting facial expressions in a mirror, Messerschmidt then set about recording them in marble and bronze. His intention, he told Nicolai, was to represent the 64 &quot;canonical grimaces&quot; of the human face using himself as a template.

During the course of the discussion, Messerschmidt went on to explain his interest in necromancy and the —not at all alien to Nicolai—and how this also inspired his character heads. Messerschmidt was a keen disciple of Hermes Trismegistus (Nicolai noted that among the few possessions that littered Messerschmidt&#x27;s workshop was a copy of an illustration featuring Trismegistus) and abided by his teachings regarding the pursuit of &quot;universal balance&quot;: a forerunner to the principles of the Golden ratio. As a result, Messerschmidt claimed that his character heads had aroused the anger of &quot;the Spirit of Proportion&quot;, an ancient being who safeguarded this knowledge. The spirit visited him at night, and forced him to endure humiliating tortures. One of Messerschmidt&#x27;s most famous heads (&quot;The Beaked&quot;) was apparently inspired by one of these encounters.

<text>Jubilee is a 1978 British drama film directed by Derek Jarman. It stars Jenny Runacre, Ian Charleson, Nell Campbell, Hermine Demoriane and a host of punk rockers. The title refers to the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 1977.

Numerous punk icons appear in the film including Adam Ant, Toyah, Jordan (a Malcolm McLaren protégé), Gene October and Jayne County. It features performances by Jayne County and Adam and the Ants. There are also cameo appearances by the Slits and Siouxsie and the Banshees. The film was scored by Brian Eno.

==Plot==
Queen Elizabeth I is transported forward in time to the film&#x27;s present day by the occultist John Dee, who commands the spirit guide Ariel (a character from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; to bring them there. Elizabeth arrives in the shattered Britain of the 1970s and moves through the social and physical decay of the city, observing the sporadic activities of a group of aimless nihilists – mostly young women, including Amyl Nitrate, Bod, Chaos, Crabs and Mad.

An early scene, set in a squat, introduces the audience to this group of characters and also to Sphinx and Angel, two incestuous bisexual brothers. Amyl Nitrate instructs a group of young women about history – in so doing, valorizing the violent criminal activity of Myra Hindley – before reminiscing about her time as a ballet dancer. Bod, a sex-hating anarchist, has just strangled and killed Queen Elizabeth II, stealing her crown in an arbitrary street robbery.

From there the group moves on to a café, where Crabs picks up a young musician called Kid, Mad tears up some postcards, and Bod attacks a waitress with a bottle of ketchup. Bod contacts impresario Borgia Ginz. On meeting Ginz, however, she is surprised to find Amyl performing a pastiche of &quot;Rule Britannia&quot;. Sphinx and Angel establish a relationship with Viv, a young former artist, whom they take to meet Max, an ex-soldier. In exchange for sexual favours, Crabs takes Kid to see Ginz, who auditions Kid&#x27;s band and signs them up under the name &quot;Scum&quot;. Sphinx and Angel try to talk Kid out of this, but he just laughs at their lecturing. Ginz is branching out into property management and has purchased &quot;abandoned&quot; properties such as Westminster Cathedral and Buckingham Palace, which are transformed into musical venues.

Meanwhile, Mad, Bod, and Crabs asphyxiate Happy Days, one of Crabs&#x27; one-night stands, with red plastic sheeting. They proceed to break into the flat of androgynous rock star Lounge Lizard, whom Bod throttles to death. A fight breaks out between Kid and a policeman, at a disco session in Westminster Cathedral. After the gang all watch Kid&#x27;s TV debut together, Viv and the three males pay a visit to Max&#x27;s bingo hall, where violent police activity causes the death of Sphinx, Angel, and the Kid. Revenge attacks on the two police officers responsible follow. One of them is castrated to death by Mad and Amyl; the other, who has just started an affair with Crabs, is blown up on his doorstep with a petrol bomb by Bod.

Finally, Ginz takes the four women off to Dorset – &quot;the only safe place to live these days&quot; – an unreconstructed right wing aristocratic enclave, where he signs a recording contract with the gang. Interspersed with these displays of contemporary anarchic violence, Dee, Ariel, and Elizabeth try to interpret the signs of anarchic modernity around them, before they undertake a pastoral and nostalgic return to the sixteenth century at the film&#x27;s end.

==Influences==
The film is heavily influenced by the 1970s punk aesthetic in its style and presentation. Shot in grainy colour, it is largely plotless and episodic. Location filming took advantage of London neighbourhoods that were economically depressed and/or still contained large amounts of rubble from the London Blitz.

==Reaction==
The film had many critics in British punk circles. Fashion designer Vivienne Westwood manufactured a T-shirt on which was printed an &quot;open letter&quot; to Jarman denouncing the film and his misrepresentations of punk. Jarman, according to biographer Tony Peake, was critical of punk&#x27;s fascination with fascism, while mocking its stupidity and petty violence.

&quot;Jubilee&quot; is now considered a cult classic, and was released by the Criterion Collection in 2003.

==Adaptations==
In November 2017, the film was adapted by Chris Goode as a play at Manchester Royal Exchange Theatre. Toyah Willcox, who played the role of Mad in the original film, performed the parts of Queen Elizabeth and Bod in this stage revival.

<text>In the metric system, a microgram or microgramme is a unit of mass equal to one millionth () of a gram. The unit symbol is μg according to the International System of Units (SI); the recommended symbol in the United States and United Kingdom when communicating medical information is mcg. In μg, the prefix symbol for micro- is the Greek letter μ (mu).

==Abbreviation and symbol confusion==
When the Greek lowercase &quot;μ&quot; (mu) is typographically unavailable, it is occasionally – although not properly – replaced by the Latin lowercase &quot;u&quot;. 

The United States–based Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommend that the symbol μg should not be used when communicating medical information due to the risk that the prefix μ (micro-) might be misread as the prefix m (milli-), resulting in a thousandfold overdose. The ISMP recommends the non-SI symbol mcg instead. However, the abbreviation mcg is also the symbol for an obsolete centimetre–gram–second system of units unit of measure known as millicentigram, which is equal to 10 μg.

Gamma (symbol: γ) is a deprecated non-SI unit of mass equal to 1 μg.

A fullwidth version of the &quot;microgram&quot; symbol is encoded by Unicode at code point for use in CJK contexts. In other contexts, a sequence of the Greek letter mu (U+03BC) and Latin letter g (U+0067) should be used.

<doc id="205427" wikidata="Q173873" url="?curid=205427" title="Azumah Nelson">
<text>Azumah Nelson (born 19 July 1958, affectionately known as the Professor) is a Ghanaian former professional boxer who competed from 1979 to 2008. He was a two-weight world champion, having held the WBC featherweight title from 1984 to 1987 and the WBC super-featherweight title twice between 1988 and 1997. He also challenged once for the unified WBC and IBF lightweight titles in 1990. At regional level, he held the ABU, and Commonwealth featherweight titles between 1980 and 1982. Widely considered one of the greatest African boxers of all time, he is currently ranked as the 69th greatest pound for pound boxer of all time by BoxRec.

== Career ==
Nelson competed at the 1978 All-Africa Games and 1978 Commonwealth Games, winning gold medals in featherweight at both events. He was awarded Amateur Boxer of the year by the Sports Writers Association of Ghana (SWAG) that same year.

However, Nelson was virtually unknown outside Ghana. Because of this, he was a decisive underdog when, on short notice, he challenged WBC featherweight champion Salvador Sánchez on 21 July 1982 at the Madison Square Garden in New York. Nelson lost the fight by fifteenth-round technical knockout.

=== Featherweight champion ===
Nelson won all four of his fights in 1983, and he began 1984 by beating Hector Cortez by decision on 9 March in Las Vegas. Then, on 8 December of that year, he became boxing royalty by knocking out Wilfredo Gómez in round 11 to win the WBC featherweight championship. Behind on the three judges&#x27; scorecards, Nelson rallied in that round to become champion in Puerto Rico.

=== Super-featherweight ===

Nelson began 1988 by defeating Mario Martinez by a split decision over 12 rounds in Los Angeles to win the vacant WBC super featherweight title. Nelson was dropped in the 10th round of their encounter and the decision was not well received.

On 1 December 1995, defeated world champion Gabriel Ruelas in the fifth round to claim the title.

His first defense took place almost a year later, when he and Jesse James Leija had their third bout. Nelson retained the title with a six-round knockout. That was the only fight Nelson had in 1996, as had become his custom.

In 1997, Nelson lost the Lineal &amp; WBC titles to Genaro Hernandez when beaten on points in twelve rounds.

==Legacy==
The Azumah Nelson Sports Complex at Kaneshie in Accra was named after him.

== Biography ==
In 2014 the biography of Azumah Nelson was published. Written by Ashley Morrison it was titled &quot;The Professor - The Life Story of Azumah Nelson&quot; () was published by Strategic Book Publishing.

==Personal life==
Nelson has 6 children; David Nelson, Dorinda Nelson, Doris Nelson, Dylis Nelson, Dalvin Nelson, Deloris Nelson, the son, Dalvin Azumah Nelson Junior, whom Nelson is training as a boxer. His mother was known as Madam Comfort Atwei Quarcoo, his brother was Joseph Awudu Nelson and his sisters are Beatrice Abiana, Theresa Louisa, Lakia Felecia and Oboshie Susana. 
Currently married to Priscilla Boakye Nelson.

In July 2018, Azumah organized a fight night to celebrate his 60th birthday at the Bukom Boxing Arena. This event brought together fighters from highly rated gyms in the country to fight contenders in their divisions. Some dignitaries including Nii Lante Vanderpuiye and Nii Amarkai Amarteifio who are two former sports ministers, Ian Walker the British High Commissioner to Ghana and Peter Zwennes the president of the Ghana Boxing Authority, graced the occasion. In all there were five bouts, three of which were won by knockout.

<text>Mabel Edeline Strickland, (8 January 1899 – 29 November 1988), was an Anglo-Maltese journalist, newspaper proprietor and politician.

==Family and personal life==

Strickland was the daughter of Sir Gerald Strickland, later the 4th Prime Minister of Malta, and Lady Edeline Sackville.

Her mother was the eldest daughter of Reginald Sackville, 7th Earl De La Warr of Knole, Kent. 

Mabel never married, leaving the bulk of her estate to her sole heir Robert Hornyold-Strickland. Mabel set up the Strickland Foundation &quot;for herself and her heirs in perpetuity&quot; in 1979. However some of her key assets including the majority shareholding of Allied Newspapers Ltd together with her family home and all of her personal, legal and administrative papers were diverted by her executors away from Mabel&#x27;s heir. This has resulted in two significant court cases filed against the Foundation and Allied Newspapers Ltd by her heir.

==Residences==
Mabel Strickland lived the most of her life at Villa Parisio in Lija, Malta. Prior to this she lived in her family home of Villa Bologna, in Attard, Malta – home of her father Lord Strickland.

==Career==

Strickland founded a newspaper group in Malta with her father and her stepmother, Lady Strickland, DBE (Margaret, daughter of Edward Hulton). In 1935 she became editor of &quot;The Times of Malta&quot; and &quot;Il Berqa&quot; before taking over as Managing Director of the Group on the death of her father in 1940. The paper never missed an issue throughout the Siege of Malta in World War Two, despite taking direct hits on several occasions. 

She was elected to the Parliament for the Constitutional Party, which was co-founded by her father, in 1950 and served until 1953 as one of only three women MPs. She departed the Constitutional to form and lead the Progressive Constitutionalist Party in 1953 and was one of the principal political leaders of the 1950s, participating in the integration talks in 1956-57 as well as opposing independence in 1964. She was re-elected to the Maltese Parliament in 1962, and served until 1966. She always fought passionately for a free and independent press and to maintain Malta&#x27;s ties with Britain and the Commonwealth. 

On her retirement she established the Strickland Foundation in the name of her family.

==Suffragist==

She is known for her work for women&#x27;s suffrage on Malta. Malta was a British colony, but when women&#x27;s suffrage was finally introduced in Great Britain in 1918, this had not been included in the 1921 Constitution on Malta, when Malta was given its own parliament, although the Labour Party did support the reform. 
In 1931, Mabel Strickland, as assistant secretary of Constitution Party, delivered a petition signed by 428 to the Royal Commission on Maltese Affairs requesting women&#x27;s suffrage without success. 

She supported the efforts of the Women of Malta Association to introduce women&#x27;s suffrage in the 1940s, and wrote: 
:&quot;The war record of the women of Malta corresponds with that which won franchise for the women in the UK after the war of 1914-1918 … Malta&#x27;s men and women, have to face the post-war period and the women have invaded the labour market … [m]any are asking, ‘When the evil of war is over, must the Maltese woman go back into a life of looker-on, a burden to the male members of the family, instead of enjoying the right of planning life and living it?’ … Malta has reached a transition stage. The clock cannot go back”.
Women&#x27;s suffrage was finally introduced in 1947.

==Death==

Mabel Strickland died on 29 November 1988, and is buried in the Strickland family crypt in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Mdina. 

Having never married or had children of her own, Mabel Strickland&#x27;s chosen sole heir was her great-nephew Robert Hornyold-Strickland. However upon Strickland&#x27;s death after Robert Hornyold-Strickland was out of Malta, Mabel, as an old lady, was persuaded to change her will by the lawyer who was to become one of her two Executors. Despite the revised will, her great nephew always remained her sole heir. But a result of the revised and very unclear will, her estate has become the subject of a legal conflict between Hornyold-Strickland and the Strickland Foundation. Mabel Strickland set up this foundation &quot;for herself and her heirs in perpetuity&quot;. 

As soon as Robert Hornyold-Strickland took legal action against the executors in 2010, having tried to find an amicable settlement for decades, the aging Executors saw fit to transfer the majority shareholding in Allied Newspapers Ltd (Times of Malta) that had been held in their own names (as executors of the estate), directly to The Strickland Foundation in a highly irregular manner. This is because The Strickland Foundation is registered as a legal person, being as it is a &quot;body corporate&quot;, and is, anyway ineligible to be a shareholder both under Maltese Company Law and also under the terms of Allied Newspapers Ltd own Articles of Associate which disallows any &quot;body corporate&quot; from being a shareholder. This irregular transfer, where no instrument of transfer has ever been produced by the executors, is now also the issue of another court case taken out by Robert Hornyold-Strickland and is still in the courts.

<text>Charles Grant Blairfindie Allen (February 24, 1848 – October 25, 1899) was a Canadian science writer and novelist, educated in England. He was a public promoter of evolution in the second half of the nineteenth century.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Allen was born on Wolfe Island near Kingston, Canada West (known as Ontario after Confederation), the second son of Catharine Ann Grant and the Rev. Joseph Antisell Allen, a Protestant minister from Dublin, Ireland. His mother was a daughter of the fifth Baron de Longueuil. Allen was educated at home until, at age 13, he and his parents moved to the United States, then to France, and finally to the United Kingdom. He was educated at King Edward&#x27;s School in Birmingham and at Merton College in Oxford, both in the United Kingdom.

After graduation, Allen studied in France, taught at Brighton College in 1870–71, and in his mid-twenties became a professor at Queen&#x27;s College, a black college in Jamaica. Despite being the son of a minister, Allen became an atheist and a socialist.

===Writing career===
After leaving his professorship, in 1876 he returned to England, where he turned his talents to writing, gaining a reputation for his essays on science and for literary works. A 2007 book by Oliver Sacks cites with approval one of Allen&#x27;s early articles, &quot;Note-Deafness&quot; (a description of what became known as amusia, published in 1878 in the learned journal &quot;Mind&quot;).

Allen&#x27;s first books dealt with scientific subjects, and include &quot;Physiological Æsthetics&quot; (1877) and &quot;Flowers and Their Pedigrees&quot; (1886) He was first influenced by associationist psychology as expounded by Alexander Bain and by Herbert Spencer, the latter who especially espoused the transition from associationist psychology to Darwinian functionalism. In Allen&#x27;s many articles on flowers and on perception in insects, Darwinian arguments replaced the old Spencerian terms, leading to a radically new vision of plant life that influenced H.G. Wells and helped transform later botanical research.

On a personal level, a long friendship that started when Allen met Spencer on his return from Jamaica grew uneasy over the years. Allen wrote a critical and revealing biographical article on Spencer that was published after Spencer&#x27;s death.

After assisting Sir W. W. Hunter with his &quot;Gazetteer of India&quot; in the early 1880s, Allen turned his attention to fiction, and between 1884 and 1899 produced about 30 novels. In 1895, his scandalous book titled &quot;The Woman Who Did&quot;, promulgating certain startling views on marriage and kindred questions, became a bestseller. The book told the story of an independent woman who has a child out of wedlock. Owing to his concern with these subjects, Allen was associated with Thomas Hardy, whose novel &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; (1895) was published the same year as &quot;The Woman Who Did&quot;.

In his career, Allen wrote two novels under female pseudonyms. One of these, the short novel &quot;The Type-writer Girl&quot;, he wrote under the name Olive Pratt Rayner.

Another work, &quot;The Evolution of the Idea of God&quot; (1897), propounds a theory of religion on heterodox lines comparable to Herbert Spencer&#x27;s &quot;ghost theory&quot;. Allen&#x27;s theory became well known and brief references to it appear in a review by Marcel Mauss, Durkheim&#x27;s nephew, in the articles of William James and in the works of Sigmund Freud. G. K. Chesterton wrote on what he considered the flawed premise of the idea, arguing that the idea of God preceded human mythologies, rather than developing from them. Chesterton said of Allen&#x27;s book on the evolution of the idea of God: &quot;it would be much more interesting if God wrote a book on the evolution of the idea of Grant Allen&quot;.

Allen also became a pioneer in science fiction, with the novel &quot;The British Barbarians&quot; (1895) This book, published about the same time as H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (which appeared in January–May 1895, and which includes a mention of Allen), also described time travel, although the plot is quite different. Allen&#x27;s short story &quot;The Thames Valley Catastrophe&quot; (published December 1897 in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;) describes the destruction of London by a sudden and massive volcanic eruption.

===Ancestry===
===Personal life===
Allen married twice, first to Caroline Ann Bootheway (1846–1871) and secondly to Ellen Jerrard (b, 1853) with whom he had one son, Jerrard Grant Allen (1878–1946), a theatrical agent/manager who in 1913 married the actress and singer Violet Englefield. They had a son, Reginald &quot;Reggie&quot; Grant Allen (1910-1985).

Grant Allen&#x27;s nephew, Grant Richards, was a writer and publisher who founded the Grant Richards publishing house. Allen encouraged his nephew&#x27;s interest in books and publishing and helped him obtain his first positions in the book trade. Richards was later to publish a number of books written by his uncle, including &quot;The Evolution of the Idea of God&quot; and those in the book series Grant Allen&#x27;s Historical Guides.

Allen&#x27;s nieces by marriage, novelist Netta Syrett, and artists Mabel Syrett and Nellie Syrret all contributed work to &quot;The Yellow Book&quot;.

In 1893 Allen left London for the hills around the Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl, enthusing on the advantages of the change of scene: &quot;Up here on the free hills, the sharp air blows in upon us, limpid and clear from a thousand leagues of open ocean; down there in the stagnant town, it stagnates and ferments.&quot;

===Death and posthumous publication===
Grant Allen died of liver cancer at his home on Hindhead, Haslemere, Surrey, England, on 25 October 1899. He died before finishing &quot;Hilda Wade&quot;. The novel&#x27;s final two episodes were completed by his friend and neighbour Dr Arthur Conan Doyle; the final episode appeared under the appropriate title &quot;The Episode of the Dead Man Who Spoke&quot; in the &quot;Strand Magazine&quot; in 1900.

==Legacy==
Many histories of detective fiction mention Allen as an innovator. The illustrious Colonel Clay is a precursor of other gentleman rogue characters; he notably bears a strong resemblance to Maurice Leblanc&#x27;s Arsène Lupin, introduced some years later. Both &quot;Miss Cayley&#x27;s Adventures&quot; and &quot;Hilda Wade&quot; feature early female detectives.

The Scene of the Crime Festival, an annual festival celebrating Canadian mystery fiction, takes place annually on Wolfe Island, Ontario, near Kingston, Allen&#x27;s birthplace and honors Allen.

A metal arch commemorating Allen, was designed by Lucy Quinnell and installed at the entrance to Allen Court in Dorking, Surrey in 2013.

<text>Rhoda Broughton (29 November 1840 – 5 June 1920) was a Welsh novelist and short story writer. Her early novels earned a reputation for sensationalism, so that her later, stronger work tended to be neglected by critics, although she was called a queen of the circulating libraries. Her novel &quot;Dear Faustina&quot; (1897) has been noted for its homoeroticism. Her novel &quot;Lavinia&quot; (1902) depicts a seemingly &quot;unmanly&quot; young man, who wishes he had been born as a woman. Broughton descended from the Broughton baronets, as a granddaughter of the 8th baronet. She was a niece of Sheridan le Fanu, who helped her to start her literary career. She was a long-time friend of fellow writer Henry James and was noted for her adversarial relationship with both Lewis Carroll and Oscar Wilde.

==Life==
Rhoda Broughton was born in Denbigh in North Wales on 29 November 1840, the daughter of the Rev. Delves Broughton, youngest son of the Rev. Sir Henry Delves-Broughton, 8th baronet, and Jane Bennett, daughter of a leading Irish barrister, George Bennett. Her aunt, Susanna Bennett, married the well-known fiction writer Sheridan le Fanu.

Rhoda Broughton developed a taste for literature as a young girl, especially poetry. She was influenced by William Shakespeare, as frequent quotations and allusions throughout her works show. Presumably, after reading &quot;The Story of Elizabeth&quot; by Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie, she had the idea of trying her own talent. She produced her first work within six weeks. Parts of this novel she took with her on a visit to her uncle Sheridan le Fanu, himself a successful author, who was highly pleased with it and assisted her in having it published – her first two novels appeared in 1867 in his &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot;. Le Fanu also introduced her to the publisher Richard Bentley, who refused her first novel on the grounds of it being improper material, but accepted the second. Broughton in turn introduced Mary Cholmondeley to her publishers in about 1887. Broughton&#x27;s writing style was to influence other writers like Mary Cecil Hay, who is thought to have a similar style of dialogue.

Bentley also published a novel of hers which he had initially rejected. She made an effort to employ the popular three-decker form and adapt it to the assumed taste of Bentley&#x27;s readers. Their professional relationship lasted until the Bentley publishing house was taken over by Macmillan in the late 1890s. By then Broughton had published 14 novels over a period of 30 years. Ten of these were in the three-volume form, which she found hard to comply with. After the commercial failure of &quot;Alas!&quot;, for which she received her highest-ever payment at the height of her career, she decided to write one-volume novels instead. This was the form for her finest works. However, she never shed her early reputation for creating fast heroines with easy morals, as in her early novels, and was still dismissed as merely slight and sensational.

After the take-over, Broughton remained with Macmillan and published another six novels there, but by then her popularity was declining. In a review published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; of 12 May 1906, a certain K. Clark complained that her latest novel was hard to procure and wondered why such a fine writer was so little appreciated.

After 1910 she moved to Stanley, Paul &amp; Co, which published three novels of hers. Her last, &quot;A Fool in Her Folly&quot; (1920), was printed posthumously with an introduction by a long-time friend and fellow writer, Marie Belloc Lowndes. This work can be seen as partially autobiographical and may have been written at an earlier time, but suppressed for personal reasons. It deals with the experiences of a young writer and reflects her own, as does her previous novel &quot;A Beginner&quot;. The manuscript is in her own handwriting, which is unusual, as some previous work had been dictated to an assistant.

Broughton&#x27;s final years were spent at Headington Hill, near Oxford where she died on 5 June 1920, aged 79. A blue plaque was unveiled on her home there on 22 October 2020.

==Works==
Somerset Maugham, in his short story &quot;The Round Dozen&quot; (1924, also known as &quot;The Ardent Bigamist&quot;) observes: &quot;I remember Miss Broughton telling me once that when she was young people said her books were fast and when she was old they said they were slow, and it was very hard since she had written exactly the same sort of book for forty years.&quot;

Rhoda Broughton never married, and some critics assume that a disappointed attachment was the impulse that made her try her pen instead of some other literary work like that of Mrs Thackeray Ritchie. Much of her life she spent with her sister, Eleanor Newcome, until the latter&#x27;s death in Richmond in 1895. In this she followed the tradition of great lady novelists like Maria Edgeworth, Jane Austen or Susan Ferrier. But there are other merits that cause her to be placed in such high company. In his article on her Richard C. Tobias calls her &quot;the leading woman novelist in England between the death of George Eliot and the beginning of Virginia Woolf&#x27;s career&quot;. He compares her work with other novelists of the time and concludes that hers reaches a much higher quality.

&quot;The Game and the Candle&quot; (1899) is like Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Persuasion&quot; (1818) rewritten: this time the heroine has married for rational reasons and is freed in the beginning for her true love, which reason forbade her to marry years before. Her dying husband&#x27;s last will obliges her to decide between love and fortune. However, a renewed encounter with her former lover forces her to see it was actually a good thing she had not married him. His love turns out to be too shallow for her happiness. The novel is one written by a mature and wise woman, who has seen the world.

In &quot;A Beginner&quot; (1894) Broughton devises a young writer who has her work secretly published and then later torn apart by unknowing people right in front of her face. The novel deals with the moral issues of writing and whether it is appropriate for a young woman to write romantic or even erotic fiction. &quot;Scylla or Charybdis?&quot; (1895) has a mother hiding her infamous past from her son and obsessing about his love even to the extent of being jealous of other women, a plot to some extent anticipating Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; (1913). The novel questions social conventions in revealing how destructive they can be to quiet people who might have once stepped aside from the proper path. In a different way the same criticism is being made in &quot;Foes in Law&quot; (1900), where the main question is which lifestyle is the one productive of the highest degree of happiness: the conventional one or one that accords with private needs.

Her next novel, &quot;Dear Faustina&quot; (1897), deals with a heroine drawn to a girl of the New Woman type. This New Woman Faustina cares nothing for social conventions and dedicates her time to fighting social injustice. Or so it seems at first sight, but the reader gets the feeling that Faustina is more interested in getting to know and impress other young women, which can also be interpreted as criticism of the New Woman as a type. The homoerotic touch reappears in &quot;Lavinia&quot; (1902), but this time it is a young man who is frequently made to appear unmanly and even utter the wish to have been born a woman. That novel also concerns itself with Britain&#x27;s craze for war heroes. Very subtly it questions dominant notions of masculinity.

Always an important feature in all her novels is criticism of woman&#x27;s role and position in society. Very often Broughton&#x27;s women are strong characters and with them, she manages to subvert traditional images of femininity. This culminates in &quot;A Waif&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1905), in which Broughton creates a married couple who turn everything traditional upside down, with the wife fulfilling the stereotype of an older, rich husband.

Broughton&#x27;s collection &quot;Tales for Christmas Eve&quot; (1873, also known as &quot;Twilight Stories&quot;) was a collection of five ghost stories. Robert S. Hadji describes her &quot;short ghost fiction as not as terrifying as her uncle&#x27;s, but it is skilfully wrought&quot;. Hadji also describes Broughton&#x27;s story &quot;Nothing But the Truth&quot; (1868, vt. &quot;The Truth, the Whole Truth, and Nothing but the Truth&quot;) as &quot;one of her cleverest stories&quot;.

During her lifetime, Broughton was one of the queens of the circulating libraries. Her fame and success was such that some found it worthwhile to satirise her in works like &quot;Groweth Down Like A Toadstool&quot; or &quot;Gone Wrong&quot; by &quot;Miss Rody Dendron&quot;. It is a pity we do not know how she took such things. Perhaps she stood up to them as she did to people like Oscar Wilde or Lewis Carroll, who bore her no love. The latter is said to have declined an invitation because Broughton would be present. The former found a match in her when it came to ironical comments in Oxford society, where she was not liked much, either, due to her ridicule of that set in her novel &quot;Belinda&quot; (1883). Nevertheless, she also had many friends in literary circles, the most prominent of them being Henry James, with whom she stayed friends until his death in 1916. According to Helen C. Black, James visited Broughton every evening, when they were both in London.

<doc id="205451" wikidata="Q1752262" url="?curid=205451" title="Split horizon route advertisement">
<text>In computer networking, split-horizon route advertisement is a method of preventing routing loops in distance-vector routing protocols by prohibiting a router from advertising a route back onto the interface from which it was learned.

The concept was suggested in 1974 by Torsten Cegrell, and originally implemented in the ARPANET-inspired Swedish network TIDAS.

==Terminology==
Here is some basic terminology:

* Route poisoning: if a node N learns that its route to a destination D is unreachable, inform that to all nodes in the network by sending them a message stating that the distance from N to D, as perceived by N, is infinite.

* Split horizon rule: if a node N uses interface I to transmit to a given destination D, N should not send through I new information about D. 

* Poison reverse rule: if a node N uses interface I to transmit to a given destination D, N sends through I the information that its cost-to-go to D is infinite.

Whereas under split horizon N does not send any information through I, under poison reverse node N tells a white-lie.

==Example==
In this example, network node &quot;A&quot; routes packets to node &quot;B&quot; in order to reach node &quot;C&quot;. The links between the nodes are distinct point-to-point links.

According to the split-horizon rule, node &quot;A&quot; does not advertise its route for &quot;C&quot; (namely &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; to &quot;C&quot;) back to &quot;B&quot;. On the surface, this seems redundant since &quot;B&quot; will never route via node &quot;A&quot; because the route costs more than the direct route from &quot;B&quot; to &quot;C&quot;. However, if the link between &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; goes down, and &quot;B&quot; had received a route from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;C&quot;, &quot;B&quot; could end up using that route via &quot;A&quot;. &quot;A&quot; would send the packet right back to &quot;B&quot;, creating a loop. This is the Count to Infinity Problem. With the split-horizon rule in place, this particular loop scenario cannot happen, improving convergence time in complex, highly-redundant environments.

Split-horizon routing with poison reverse is a variant of split-horizon route advertising in which a router actively advertises routes as unreachable over the interface over which they were learned by setting the route metric to infinite (16 for RIP). The effect of such an announcement is to immediately remove most looping routes before they can propagate through the network.

The main disadvantage of poison reverse is that it can significantly increase the size of routing announcements in certain fairly common network topologies, but it allows for the improvement of the overall efficiency of the network in case of faults.
Split horizon states that if a neighboring router sends a route to a router, the receiving router will not propagate this route back to the advertising router on the same interface.

With route poisoning, when a router detects that one of its connected routes has failed, the router will poison the route by assigning an infinite metric to it and advertising it to neighbors. When a router advertises a poisoned route to its neighbors, its neighbors break the rule of split horizon and send back to the originator the same poisoned route, called a poison reverse.
In order to give the router enough time to propagate the poisoned route and to ensure that no routing loops occur while propagation occurs, the routers implement a hold-down mechanism.

Poison Reverse is often used within distance-vector routing to solve the count-to-infinity problem. Practically, poison reverse can be thought of as an alternative to split horizon. With poison reverse, route advertisements that would be suppressed by split horizon are instead advertised with a distance of infinity.

The basic idea of poison reverse is to make sure that a path does not turn back into the same node if a cost has changed within the network. An example of this would be: Node Z routes via node Y to destination X. If the cost between Y and X increases, the count to infinity problem will occur. To avoid it, we implement poison reverse. As long as Z routes via node Y to get to X, Z will tell a white lie to Y: Z will announce to Y an infinite cost to the destination X.

The numbers on the edges are the costs of the links.

Following this topology, we build the distance vectors of all nodes in the network:

The first, second and third lines correspond to node Z, node Y and node X distance vectors, respectively.

The following matrix contains the estimates of the distances from Z to all the other nodes in the network through each of its neighbors.

As Z routes via Y to get to X, the cost-to-go from Z to X is 3. 
The poison reverse kicks in when a node broadcasts its distance vector to its neighbors.
The distance vectors broadcast by Z are:

To Y: node Z advertises its distance vector, replacing the last element by ∞, i.e., it sends 
[0, 1, ∞]

To X: node Z advertises its distance vector, without any replacements, i.e., it sends
[0, 1, 3]

As we see in the distance vector that is broadcast to node Y the end destination X has an infinity value. 

Poison reverse solves the count-to-infinity problem since if the link between Y and X has its cost increased to, say, 70, then Y and Z will not bounce between each other and instead directly try another path. Alternatively, if poison reverse is not used, when the link between Y and X has its cost increased, Y will announce the news to Z. However, before announcing, Y may leverage the fact that Z can reach X with a cost of 3 to decide that Y can reach X with a cost of 4. Then, Z updates its cost-to-go to X, through Y, as 5. Following that, Y updates its cost-to-go to X, through Z, as 6, and so on, until cost-to-go from Z to X reaches 30. At this point, after 30 iterations, the algorithm converges. 

Poison reverse doesn&#x27;t always work. For example:

If the link between C and D would fail node C can still try to go through B to get to the destination. B was already routing through A, and will continue doing so. Now, A cannot route through B, due to poison reverse, but at this point A will eventually receive a message from C announcing that C has a route with cost 7 to D, where c(C,B)+distance(B,D)=3+(3+1)=7. Then, A will rely on C to route to D. In summary, after failure of CD, C will update, followed by A, B, C, A, B, C and so on. From there we have a loop that we can not solve with poison reverse.

This can though be completed with an implementation of a distance vector protocol called RIP.

==Implementations==
The split-horizon method is effective and simple to implement, and is therefore used by most distance-vector protocols. It is notably used by:
* RIP
* IGRP
* EIGRP
* VPLS, which uses the split horizon technique to avoid loops in the forwarding plane
* Babel, which applies split-horizon to wired links only

<text>Task Force 16 (TF 16) was one of the most storied task forces in the United States Navy, a major participant in a number of the most important battles of the Pacific War.

In July 1941, drew the assignment of ferrying army aircraft to Iceland because of a lack of British aircraft to cover the American landings. The American P-40s would provide the defensive fighter cover necessary to watch over the initial American occupying forces. &quot;Wasp&quot; slipped out to sea on 28 July, with the destroyers and &quot;Walke&quot; as plane guards. The heavy cruiser later joined the formation at sea.

Within a few days, &quot;Wasp&quot;″s group joined the larger Task Force 16—consisting of the battleship , the heavy cruisers &quot;Quincy&quot; and &quot;Wichita&quot;, five destroyers, the auxiliary , the attack transport , the stores ship , and the amphibious cargo ship . Those ships, too, were bound for Iceland with the first occupation troops embarked. On the morning of 6 August, &quot;Wasp&quot;, &quot;Vincennes&quot;, &quot;Walke&quot;, and &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; parted company from Task Force 16 (TF 16). Soon thereafter, the carrier turned into the wind and commenced launching the planes from the 33rd Pursuit Squadron. As the P-40s and the trio of trainers droned on to Iceland, &quot;Wasp&quot; headed home for Norfolk, her three escorts in company. After another week at sea, the group arrived back at Norfolk on 14 August.

The Task Force was re-formed in mid-February 1942 around &quot;Enterprise&quot; (CV-6), with Vice Admiral William F. Halsey in command of the force, and supported by cruisers &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; (CA-25) and &quot;Northampton&quot; (CA-26), along with a half-dozen destroyers.

The task force&#x27;s first mission was to shell Wake Island and Marcus Island, then, joined by &quot;Hornet&quot; (CV-8) and the rest of Task Force 18 (TF18), in April the force conducted the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo. In May Halsey was ordered to join Task Force 17 (TF17) in the Coral Sea, but the Battle of the Coral Sea was over before TF 16 could join in.

Halsey was then hospitalized with a skin disease, so Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance took over TF 16 and along with TF 17, led it to victory in the Battle of Midway.

In August, the task force supported the landings on Guadalcanal, then fought in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, followed by the great Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands in October, the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in November, and covered the retreat of TF 18 after the Battle of Rennell Island.

In March 1943, TG 16.6 fought the Battle of the Komandorski Islands, then bombarded Attu in April, and the whole force supported the recapture of the Aleutians in the Battle of Attu.

In 1944 and 1945, the task force was a refueling unit consisting of destroyer escorts and oilers.

<text>Johan Axelsson Oxenstierna af Södermöre (24 June 1611 – 5 December 1657) was a Count and a Swedish statesman.

==Biography==
The son of Lord High Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, he was born in Stockholm. He completed his studies at Uppsala in 1633, and was sent by his father on a grand tour through France, the Netherlands, and Great Britain. He served under his brother-in-law Count Gustav Horn af Björneborg in the Thirty Years&#x27; War from 1632, and was subsequently employed by his father in various diplomatic missions, though his instructions were always so precise and minute that he was little more than the executor of the Chancellor&#x27;s wishes. He was one of the commissioners who signed the truce of 1635 with Poland (Armistice of Stuhmsdorf or Treaty of Sztumska Wieś), and in 1639, much against his father&#x27;s will, was made a Privy Councillor.

Along with Salvius, he represented Sweden at the great peace congress of Osnabrück, but as he received his instructions directly from his father, whereas Salvius was in the confidence of Queen Christina, the two &quot;legates&quot; were constantly at variance. From 1650 to 1652 he was Governor General of Swedish Pomerania. King Charles X Gustav made him Marshal of the Realm.

<text>Baron Gabriel Gustafsson Oxenstierna (15 June 1587 – 27 November 1640) was a Swedish statesman.

Born either in Tyresö, Sweden, or in Reval (modern Tallinn, Estonia), he was the son of Privy Councillor Gustaf Gabrielsson Oxenstierna and Barbro Axelsdotter Bielke. As such he was brother of, among others, Lord High Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna.

==Career==
Oxenstierna began studying in Uppsala. He continued to study abroad, in German towns Rostock, Wittenberg and Jena. After his return to Sweden, he was in the service of King Charles IX from 1604. From 1612 he was chancellor and chief adviser of Duke John, son of former King John III. Also in 1612, Oxenstierna was appointed governor of Estonia. In 1617 he became a Privy Councillor and a marshal of the court of King Gustavus Adolphus.

Being a close confidant of older brother Axel Oxenstierna (Lord High Chancellor 1612–1654) as well as of the king, Gabriel Oxenstierna was used as a diplomatic representative on numerous occasions. He was sent as a legate to Denmark both in 1622 and 1625, and during the latter year he also visited Lübeck, Hamburg, Mecklenburg, Brandenburg, Pomerania, the Netherlands and England.

After the death of Gustavus Adolphus in 1632, Oxenstierna travelled to Germany to meet his brother Axel. Gabriel then became responsible to transport the body of the king back to Sweden. In 1634, he became Lord High Steward (&quot;riksdrots&quot;), making him head of Svea Court of Appeal (&quot;Svea Hovrätt&quot;) and as such supervisor of justice in Sweden.

==Family life==
In 1611, Oxenstierna married Märta Bielke, daughter of Privy Councillor Ture Bielke and Margareta Sture. Märta gave birth to seven children, two of which died at an early age. In 1620, Märta died. Two years later, in November 1620, Oxenstierna married again, this time with Margareta Bielke, daughter of Claes Nilsson Bielke and Elin Fleming. Margareta died in 1629 and two years later, Oxenstierna married for the third time, now with Brita De la Gardie, daughter of Pontus De la Gardie and, as such, sister to Lord High Constable Jacob De la Gardie. Oxenstierna&#x27;s two last marriages were both childless.

Gabriel Gustafsson Oxenstierna died in Von der Linderska Palace, Stockholm on 27 November 1640.

==Legacy==
Oxenstierna has been described as &quot;reasonable, honest, jovial and outspoken, loved by high and low&quot;. Because of his service and loyalty to his home country, his children and grandchildren were created counts, under the name Oxenstierna of Croneberg.

After inheriting Tyresö in the 1620s, Oxenstierna ordered a reconstruction of Tyresö Palace as well as the building Tyresö Church. The church was inaugurated with his own burial in 1641.

<text>Count Bengt Gabrielsson Oxenstierna (1623–1702) was a Swedish soldier and statesman who served as Foreign Minister from 1680 to 1697. He ensured Sweden remained neutral during this period and moved away from its traditional French alliance.

==Life==
Bengt Gabrielsson Oxenstierna was born in Stockholm, Sweden on 16 July 1623. He was the eldest surviving son of Gabriel Bengtsson Oxenstierna (1586–1656) and Anna Gustafsdotter Banér (1585-1656). He had eleven brothers and sisters. 

He was married twice to Eva Juliana Wachtmeister (1639-1666), then Magdalena Stenbock (1649-1727); the two marriages produced over 20 children in all. His marriage to Eva connected Oxenstierna to Hans and Axel Wachtmeister, senior Swedish nobles who were both anti-French. 

His second wife, Magdalena, came from one of the leading families in Sweden. She was an intelligent and influential individual in her own right and often acted as his political colleague.

== Career ==

After being educated abroad, he began his diplomatic career at the discussions which led to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia that ended the Thirty Years&#x27; War. During this time, he became a trusted confidant of the future Charles X of Sweden. Two years after Charles became king in 1652, Oxenstierna represented Sweden at the Kreistag of Lower Saxony. 

When the Second Northern War began in 1655, he took part in the Swedish invasion of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and became Governor of the newly-conquered Duchy of Lithuania. In July 1658, he commanded the garrison of Thorn, now Toruń when it was besieged by an Imperial-Polish force, surrendering in December; he later helped negotiate the peace of Oliva that ended the war. 

Oxenstierna generally supported closer relations between Sweden and the Holy Roman Empire, placing him in opposition to the pro-French faction headed by Magnus de la Gardie. When Charles X died in 1660, his son Charles XI of Sweden was four years old and ruled through a Regency; Oxenstierna was sidelined by de la Gardie and served as Governor-general of Livonia from 1662 to 1666. 

He recovered some influence when Charles XI attained his majority in 1672 and was Ambassador to Vienna from 1674 to 1676. While there, he presented a &#x27;Memorial&#x27; or paper to Emperor Leopold titled &quot;The case of the persecuted and oppressed Protestants in some parts of Germany and Hungary,&quot; which was later published in London. During the 1675 to 1679 Scanian War, most of Swedish Pomerania was captured by Brandenburg-Prussia and Denmark-Norway. Oxenstierna helped negotiate the 1679 Saint-Germain-en-Laye, which restored most of these losses. 

When his chief minister Johan Göransson Gyllenstierna died in 1680, Charles appointed Oxenstierna President of the Court of Chancery, a position that traditionally controlled foreign policy. A contemporary observed that their personalities were very different, describing Oxenstierna as &#x27;sluggish and formal&#x27; but that both shared a passion for horses. They also believed Sweden needed peace to restore its economy and society, a guiding principle followed for 17 years. 

Oxenstierna moved Sweden away from its traditional pro-French alliance, instead following a policy of friendship with England, the Dutch Republic and the Holy Roman Empire. This policy ensued in the 1681 Treaty of the Hague between Sweden, the Dutch Republic and Emperor Leopold, although he ensured Sweden remained neutral from 1688 to 1697 Nine Years War.

As President of the Court of Chancery, he was also de facto Minister of Culture, approving all publications; author and military engineer Erik Dahlbergh (1625-1703) dedicated several books to him. 

When Charles XI died in 1697, Oxenstierna was one of the regents during the minority of his son Charles XII of Sweden, a talented soldier of great energy and ambition. Charles launched the Great Northern War in 1700, and Oxenstierna retired from office; he died in July 1702 and was buried in Uppsala Cathedral.
The 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; describes him as &quot;a shrewd and subtle little man, of gentle disposition, but remarkable for his firmness and tenacity of character.&quot;

<text>The human microbiome is the aggregate of all microbiota that reside on or within human tissues and biofluids along with the corresponding anatomical sites in which they reside, including the gastrointestinal tract, skin, mammary glands, seminal fluid, uterus, ovarian follicles, lung, saliva, oral mucosa, conjunctiva, and the biliary tract. Types of human microbiota include bacteria, archaea, fungi, protists, and viruses. Though micro-animals can also live on the human body, they are typically excluded from this definition. In the context of genomics, the term &quot;human microbiome&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the collective genomes of resident microorganisms; however, the term &quot;human metagenome&quot; has the same meaning.

The human body hosts many microorganisms, with approximately the same order of magnitude of non-human cells as human cells. Some microorganisms that humans host are commensal, meaning they co-exist without harming humans; others have a mutualistic relationship with their human hosts. Conversely, some non-pathogenic microorganisms can harm human hosts via the metabolites they produce, like trimethylamine, which the human body converts to trimethylamine N-oxide via FMO3-mediated oxidation. Certain microorganisms perform tasks that are known to be useful to the human host, but the role of most of them is not well understood. Those that are expected to be present, and that under normal circumstances do not cause disease, are sometimes deemed &quot;normal flora&quot; or &quot;normal microbiota&quot;.

During early life, the establishment of a diverse and balanced human microbiota plays a critical role in shaping an individual&#x27;s long-term health. Studies have shown that the composition of the gut microbiota during infancy is influenced by various factors, including mode of delivery, breastfeeding, and exposure to environmental factors. There are several beneficial species of bacteria and potential probiotics present in breast milk. Research has highlighted the beneficial effects of a healthy microbiota in early life, such as the promotion of immune system development, regulation of metabolism, and protection against pathogenic microorganisms. Understanding the complex interplay between the human microbiota and early life health is crucial for developing interventions and strategies to support optimal microbiota development and improve overall health outcomes in individuals.

The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) took on the project of sequencing the genome of the human microbiota, focusing particularly on the microbiota that normally inhabit the skin, mouth, nose, digestive tract, and vagina. It reached a milestone in 2012 when it published its initial results.
==Terminology==

Though widely known as &quot;flora or&quot; &quot;microflora&quot;, this is a misnomer in technical terms, since the word root &quot;flora&quot; pertains to plants, and &quot;biota&quot; refers to the total collection of organisms in a particular ecosystem. Recently, the more appropriate term &quot;microbiota&quot; is applied, though its use has not eclipsed the entrenched use and recognition of &quot;flora&quot; with regard to bacteria and other microorganisms. Both terms are being used in different literature.

==Relative numbers==
The number of bacterial cells in the human body is estimated to be around 38 trillion, while the estimate for human cells is around 30 trillion. The number of bacterial genes is estimated to be 2 million, 100 times the number of approximately 20,000 human genes.

==Study==
The problem of elucidating the human microbiome is essentially identifying the members of a microbial community, which includes bacteria, eukaryotes, and viruses. This is done primarily using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-based studies, though ribonucleic acid (RNA), protein and metabolite based studies are also performed. DNA-based microbiome studies typically can be categorized as either targeted amplicon studies or, more recently, shotgun metagenomic studies. The former focuses on specific known marker genes and is primarily informative taxonomically, while the latter is an entire metagenomic approach which can also be used to study the functional potential of the community. One of the challenges that is present in human microbiome studies, but not in other metagenomic studies, is to avoid including the host DNA in the study.

Aside from simply elucidating the composition of the human microbiome, one of the major questions involving the human microbiome is whether there is a &quot;core&quot;, that is, whether there is a subset of the community that is shared among most humans. If there is a core, then it would be possible to associate certain community compositions with disease states, which is one of the goals of the HMP. It is known that the human microbiome (such as the gut microbiota) is highly variable both within a single subject and among different individuals, a phenomenon which is also observed in mice.

On 13 June 2012, a major milestone of the HMP was announced by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) director Francis Collins. The announcement was accompanied with a series of coordinated articles published in Nature and several journals in the Public Library of Science (PLoS) on the same day. By mapping the normal microbial make-up of healthy humans using genome sequencing techniques, the researchers of the HMP have created a reference database and the boundaries of normal microbial variation in humans. From 242 healthy U.S. volunteers, more than 5,000 samples were collected from tissues from 15 (men) to 18 (women) body sites such as mouth, nose, skin, lower intestine (stool), and vagina. All the DNA, human and microbial, were analyzed with DNA sequencing machines. The microbial genome data were extracted by identifying the bacterial specific ribosomal RNA, 16S rRNA. The researchers calculated that more than 10,000 microbial species occupy the human ecosystem, and they have identified 81–99% of the genera.

=== Analysis after the processing ===
The statistical analysis is essential to validate the obtained results (ANOVA can be used to size the differences between the groups); if it is paired with graphical tools, the outcome is easily visualized and understood.

Once a metagenome is assembled, it is possible to infer the functional potential of the microbiome. The computational challenges for this type of analysis are greater than for single genomes, because usually metagenomes assemblers have poorer quality, and many recovered genes are non-complete or fragmented. After the gene identification step, the data can be used to carry out a functional annotation by means of multiple alignment of the target genes against orthologs databases.

=== Marker gene analysis ===
It is a technique that exploits primers to target a specific genetic region and enables to determine the microbial phylogenies. The genetic region is characterized by a highly variable region which can confer detailed identification; it is delimited by conserved regions, which function as binding sites for primers used in PCR. The main gene used to characterize bacteria and archaea is 16S rRNA gene, while fungi identification is based on Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS). The technique is fast and not so expensive and enables to obtain a low-resolution classification of a microbial sample; it is optimal for samples that may be contaminated by host DNA. Primer affinity varies among all DNA sequences, which may result in biases during the amplification reaction; indeed, low-abundance samples are susceptible to overamplification errors, since the other contaminating microorganisms result to be over-represented in case of increasing the PCR cycles. Therefore, the optimization of primer selection can help to decrease such errors, although it requires complete knowledge of the microorganisms present in the sample, and their relative abundances.

Marker gene analysis can be influenced by the primer choice; in this kind of analysis, it is desirable to use a well-validated protocol (such as the one used in the Earth Microbiome Project). The first thing to do in a marker gene amplicon analysis is to remove sequencing errors; a lot of sequencing platforms are very reliable, but most of the apparent sequence diversity is still due to errors during the sequencing process. To reduce this phenomenon a first approach is to cluster sequences into Operational taxonomic unit (OTUs): this process consolidates similar sequences (a 97% similarity threshold is usually adopted) into a single feature that can be used in further analysis steps; this method however would discard SNPs because they would get clustered into a single OTU. Another approach is Oligotyping, which includes position-specific information from 16s rRNA sequencing to detect small nucleotide variations and from discriminating between closely related distinct taxa. These methods give as an output a table of DNA sequences and counts of the different sequences per sample rather than OTU.

Another important step in the analysis is to assign a taxonomic name to microbial sequences in the data. This can be done using machine learning approaches that can reach an accuracy at genus-level of about 80%. Other popular analysis packages provide support for taxonomic classification using exact matches to reference databases and should provide greater specificity, but poor sensitivity. Unclassified microorganism should be further checked for organelle sequences.

=== Phylogenetic analysis ===
Many methods that exploit phylogenetic inference use the 16SRNA gene for Archea and Bacteria and the 18SRNA gene for Eukaryotes. Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCS) are based on the comparison of multiple traits among microorganisms; the principle is: the closely they are related, the higher number of traits they share. Usually PCS are coupled with phylogenetic generalized least square (PGLS) or other statistical analysis to get more significant results. Ancestral state reconstruction is used in microbiome studies to impute trait values for taxa whose traits are unknown. This is commonly performed with PICRUSt, which relies on available databases. Phylogenetic variables are chosen by researchers according to the type of study: through the selection of some variables with significant biological informations, it is possible to reduce the dimension of the data to analyse.

Phylogenetic aware distance is usually performed with UniFrac or similar tools, such as Soresen&#x27;s index or Rao&#x27;s D, to quantify the differences between the different communities. All this methods are negatively affected by horizontal gene transmission (HGT), since it can generate errors and lead to the correlation of distant species. There are different ways to reduce the negative impact of HGT: the use of multiple genes or computational tools to assess the probability of putative HGT events.

=== Ecological Network analysis ===
Microbial communities develop in a very complex dynamic which can be viewed and analyzed as an ecosystem. The ecological interactions between microbes govern its change, equilibrium and stability, and can be represented by a population dynamic model.
The ongoing study of ecological features of the microbiome is growing rapidly and allows to understand the fundamental properties of the microbiome. Understanding the underlying rules of microbial community could help with treating diseases related to unstable microbial communities.
A very basic question is if different humans, who share different microbial communities, have the same underlying microbial dynamics. Increasing evidence and indications have found that the dynamics is indeed universal. This question is a basic step that will allow scientists to develop treatment strategies, based on the complex dynamics of human microbial communities.
There are more important properties on which considerations should be taken into account for developing interventions strategies for controlling the human microbial dynamics. Controlling the microbial communities could result in solving very bad and harmful diseases.

== Types ==

=== Bacteria ===
Populations of microbes (such as bacteria and yeasts) inhabit the skin and mucosal surfaces in various parts of the body. Their role forms part of normal, healthy human physiology, however if microbe numbers grow beyond their typical ranges (often due to a compromised immune system) or if microbes populate (such as through poor hygiene or injury) areas of the body normally not colonized or sterile (such as the blood, or the lower respiratory tract, or the abdominal cavity), disease can result (causing, respectively, bacteremia/sepsis, pneumonia, and peritonitis).

The Human Microbiome Project found that individuals host thousands of bacterial types, different body sites having their own distinctive communities. Skin and vaginal sites showed smaller diversity than the mouth and gut, these showing the greatest richness. The bacterial makeup for a given site on a body varies from person to person, not only in type, but also in abundance. Bacteria of the same species found throughout the mouth are of multiple subtypes, preferring to inhabit distinctly different locations in the mouth. Even the enterotypes in the human gut, previously thought to be well understood, are from a broad spectrum of communities with blurred taxon boundaries.

It is estimated that 500 to 1,000 species of bacteria live in the human gut but belong to just a few phyla: Bacillota and Bacteroidota dominate but there are also Pseudomonadota, Verrucomicrobiota, Actinobacteriota, Fusobacteriota, and &quot;Cyanobacteria&quot;.

A number of types of bacteria, such as &quot;Actinomyces viscosus&quot; and &quot;A. naeslundii&quot;, live in the mouth, where they are part of a sticky substance called plaque. If this is not removed by brushing, it hardens into calculus (also called tartar). The same bacteria also secrete acids that dissolve tooth enamel, causing tooth decay.

The vaginal microflora consist mostly of various lactobacillus species. It was long thought that the most common of these species was &quot;Lactobacillus acidophilus&quot;, but it has later been shown that &quot;L. iners&quot; is in fact most common, followed by &quot;L. crispatus&quot;. Other lactobacilli found in the vagina are &quot;L. jensenii, L. delbruekii&quot; and &quot;L. gasseri&quot;. Disturbance of the vaginal flora can lead to infections such as bacterial vaginosis and candidiasis.

=== Archaea ===
Archaea are present in the human gut, but, in contrast to the enormous variety of bacteria in this organ, the numbers of archaeal species are much more limited. The dominant group are the methanogens, particularly &quot;Methanobrevibacter smithii&quot; and &quot;Methanosphaera stadtmanae&quot;. However, colonization by methanogens is variable, and only about 50% of humans have easily detectable populations of these organisms.

As of 2007, no clear examples of archaeal pathogens were known, although a relationship has been proposed between the presence of some methanogens and human periodontal disease. Methane-dominant small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is also predominantly caused by methanogens, and &quot;Methanobrevibacter smithii&quot; in particular.

=== Fungi ===

Fungi, in particular yeasts, are present in the human gut. The best-studied of these are &quot;Candida&quot; species due to their ability to become pathogenic in immunocompromised and even in healthy hosts. Yeasts are also present on the skin, such as &quot;Malassezia&quot; species, where they consume oils secreted from the sebaceous glands.

=== Viruses ===
Viruses, especially bacterial viruses (bacteriophages), colonize various body sites. These colonized sites include the skin, gut, lungs, and oral cavity. Virus communities have been associated with some diseases, and do not simply reflect the bacterial communities.

In January 2024, biologists reported the discovery of &quot;obelisks&quot;, a new class of viroid-like elements, and &quot;oblins&quot;, their related group of proteins, in the human microbiome.

== Anatomical areas ==
=== Skin ===

A study of 20 skin sites on each of ten healthy humans found 205 identified genera in 19 bacterial phyla, with most sequences assigned to four phyla: Actinomycetota (51.8%), Bacillota (24.4%), Pseudomonadota (16.5%), and Bacteroidota (6.3%). A large number of fungal genera are present on healthy human skin, with some variability by region of the body; however, during pathological conditions, certain genera tend to dominate in the affected region. For example, &quot;Malassezia&quot; is dominant in atopic dermatitis and &quot;Acremonium&quot; is dominant on dandruff-affected scalps.

The skin acts as a barrier to deter the invasion of pathogenic microbes. The human skin contains microbes that reside either in or on the skin and can be residential or transient. Resident microorganism types vary in relation to skin type on the human body. A majority of microbes reside on superficial cells on the skin or prefer to associate with glands. These glands such as oil or sweat glands provide the microbes with water, amino acids, and fatty acids. In addition, resident bacteria that associated with oil glands are often Gram-positive and can be pathogenic.

=== Conjunctiva ===
A small number of bacteria and fungi are normally present in the conjunctiva. Classes of bacteria include Gram-positive cocci (e.g., &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus&quot;) and Gram-negative rods and cocci (e.g., &quot;Haemophilus&quot; and &quot;Neisseria&quot;) are present. Fungal genera include &quot;Candida&quot;, &quot;Aspergillus&quot;, and &quot;Penicillium&quot;. The lachrymal glands continuously secrete, keeping the conjunctiva moist, while intermittent blinking lubricates the conjunctiva and washes away foreign material. Tears contain bactericides such as lysozyme, so that microorganisms have difficulty in surviving the lysozyme and settling on the epithelial surfaces.

=== Gastrointestinal tract ===


In humans, the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome is established during birth. Birth by Cesarean section or vaginal delivery also influences the gut&#x27;s microbial composition. Babies born through the vaginal canal have non-pathogenic, beneficial gut microbiota similar to those found in the mother. However, the gut microbiota of babies delivered by C-section harbors more pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus and it takes longer to develop non-pathogenic, beneficial gut microbiota.

The relationship between some gut microbiota and humans is not merely commensal (a non-harmful coexistence), but rather a mutualistic relationship. Some human gut microorganisms benefit the host by fermenting dietary fiber into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetic acid and butyric acid, which are then absorbed by the host. Intestinal bacteria also play a role in synthesizing vitamin B and vitamin K as well as metabolizing bile acids, sterols, and xenobiotics. The systemic importance of the SCFAs and other compounds they produce are like hormones and the gut flora itself appears to function like an endocrine organ, and dysregulation of the gut flora has been correlated with a host of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.

The composition of human gut microbiota changes over time, when the diet changes, and as overall health changes. A systematic review of 15 human randomized controlled trials from July 2016 found that certain commercially available strains of probiotic bacteria from the &quot;Bifidobacterium&quot; and &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; genera (&quot;B. longum&quot;, &quot;B. breve&quot;, &quot;B. infantis&quot;, &quot;L. helveticus&quot;, &quot;L. rhamnosus&quot;, &quot;L. plantarum&quot;, and &quot;L. casei&quot;), when taken by mouth in daily doses of 109–1010 colony forming units (CFU) for 1–2 months, possess treatment efficacy (i.e., improves behavioral outcomes) in certain central nervous system disorders – including anxiety, depression, autism spectrum disorder, and obsessive–compulsive disorder – and improves certain aspects of memory.

=== Urethra and bladder ===
The genitourinary system appears to have a microbiota, which is an unexpected finding in light of the long-standing use of standard clinical microbiological culture methods to detect bacteria in urine when people show signs of a urinary tract infection; it is common for these tests to show no bacteria present. It appears that common culture methods do not detect many kinds of bacteria and other microorganisms that are normally present. As of 2017, sequencing methods were used to identify these microorganisms to determine if there are differences in microbiota between people with urinary tract problems and those who are healthy. To properly assess the microbiome of the bladder as opposed to the genitourinary system, the urine specimen should be collected directly from the bladder, which is often done with a catheter.

=== Vagina ===
Vaginal microbiota refers to those species and genera that colonize the vagina. These organisms play an important role in protecting against infections and maintaining vaginal health. The most abundant vaginal microorganisms found in premenopausal women are from the genus &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;, which suppress pathogens by producing hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid. Bacterial species composition and ratios vary depending on the stage of the menstrual cycle. Ethnicity also influences vaginal flora. The occurrence of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli is lower in African American women and vaginal pH is higher. Other influential factors such as sexual intercourse and antibiotics have been linked to the loss of lactobacilli. Moreover, studies have found that sexual intercourse with a condom does appear to change lactobacilli levels, and does increase the level of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; within the vaginal flora. Changes in the normal, healthy vaginal microbiota is an indication of infections, such as candidiasis or bacterial vaginosis. &quot;Candida albicans&quot; inhibits the growth of &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; species, while &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; species which produce hydrogen peroxide inhibit the growth and virulence of &quot;Candida albicans&quot; in both the vagina and the gut.

Fungal genera that have been detected in the vagina include &quot;Candida&quot;, &quot;Pichia&quot;, &quot;Eurotium&quot;, &quot;Alternaria&quot;, &quot;Rhodotorula&quot;, and &quot;Cladosporium&quot;, among others.

===Placenta===
Until recently the placenta was considered to be a sterile organ but commensal, nonpathogenic bacterial species and genera have been identified that reside in the placental tissue. However, the existence of a microbiome in the placenta is controversial as criticized in several researches. So called &quot;placental microbiome&quot; is likely derived from contamination of regents because low-biomass samples are easily contaminated.

===Uterus===

Until recently, the upper reproductive tract of women was considered to be a sterile environment. A variety of microorganisms inhabit the uterus of healthy, asymptomatic women of reproductive age. The microbiome of the uterus differs significantly from that of the vagina and gastrointestinal tract.

=== Oral cavity ===
The environment present in the human mouth allows the growth of characteristic microorganisms found there. It provides a source of water and nutrients, as well as a moderate temperature. Resident microbes of the mouth adhere to the teeth and gums to resist mechanical flushing from the mouth to stomach where acid-sensitive microbes are destroyed by hydrochloric acid.

Anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity include: &quot;Actinomyces&quot;, &quot;Arachnia&quot;, &quot;Bacteroides&quot;, &quot;Bifidobacterium&quot;, &quot;Eubacterium&quot;, &quot;Fusobacterium&quot;, &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;, &quot;Leptotrichia&quot;, &quot;Peptococcus&quot;, &quot;Peptostreptococcus&quot;, &quot;Propionibacterium&quot;, &quot;Selenomonas&quot;, &quot;Treponema&quot;, and &quot;Veillonella&quot;. Genera of fungi that are frequently found in the mouth include &quot;Candida&quot;, &quot;Cladosporium&quot;, &quot;Aspergillus&quot;, &quot;Fusarium&quot;, &quot;Glomus&quot;, &quot;Alternaria&quot;, &quot;Penicillium&quot;, and &quot;Cryptococcus&quot;, among others.

Bacteria accumulate on both the hard and soft oral tissues in biofilm allowing them to adhere and strive in the oral environment while protected from the environmental factors and antimicrobial agents. Saliva plays a key biofilm homeostatic role allowing recolonization of bacteria for formation and controlling growth by detaching biofilm buildup. It also provides a means of nutrients and temperature regulation. The location of the biofilm determines the type of exposed nutrients it receives.

Oral bacteria have evolved mechanisms to sense their environment and evade or modify the host. However, a highly efficient innate host defense system constantly monitors the bacterial colonization and prevents bacterial invasion of local tissues. A dynamic equilibrium exists between dental plaque bacteria and the innate host defense system.

This dynamic between host oral cavity and oral microbes plays a key role in health and disease as it provides entry into the body.
A healthy equilibrium presents a symbiotic relationship where oral microbes limit growth and adherence of pathogens while the host provides an environment for them to flourish. Ecological changes such as change of immune status, shift of resident microbes and nutrient availability shift from a mutual to parasitic relationship resulting in the host being prone to oral and systemic disease. Systemic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases has been correlated to poor oral health. Of particular interest is the role of oral microorganisms in the two major dental diseases: dental caries and periodontal disease. Pathogen colonization at the periodontium cause an excessive immune response resulting in a periodontal pocket- a deepened space between the tooth and gingiva. This acts as a protected blood-rich reservoir with nutrients for anaerobic pathogens. Systemic disease at various sites of the body can result from oral microbes entering the blood bypassing periodontal pockets and oral membranes.

Persistent proper oral hygiene is the primary method for preventing oral and systemic disease. It reduces the density of biofilm and overgrowth of potential pathogenic bacteria resulting in disease. However, proper oral hygiene may not be enough as the oral microbiome, genetics, and changes to immune response play a factor in developing chronic infections. Use of antibiotics could treat already spreading infection but ineffective against bacteria within biofilms.

=== Nasal cavity ===
The healthy nasal microbiome is dominated by &quot;Corynebacterium&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; species. The mucosal microbiome plays a critical role in modulating viral infection.

=== Lung ===

Much like the oral cavity, the upper and lower respiratory system possess mechanical deterrents to remove microbes. Goblet cells produce mucus which traps microbes and moves them out of the respiratory system via continuously moving ciliated epithelial cells. In addition, a bactericidal effect is generated by nasal mucus which contains the enzyme lysozyme. The upper and lower respiratory tract appears to have its own set of microbiota. Pulmonary bacterial microbiota belong to 9 major bacterial genera: &quot;Prevotella&quot;, &quot;Sphingomonas&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, &quot;Acinetobacter&quot;, &quot;Fusobacterium&quot;, &quot;Megasphaera&quot;, &quot;Veillonella&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;, and &quot;Streptococcus&quot;. Some of the bacteria considered &quot;normal biota&quot; in the respiratory tract can cause serious disease especially in immunocompromised individuals; these include &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot;, and &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. Fungal genera that compose the pulmonary mycobiome include &quot;Candida&quot;, &quot;Malassezia&quot;, &quot;Neosartorya&quot;, &quot;Saccharomyces&quot;, and &quot;Aspergillus&quot;, among others.

Unusual distributions of bacterial and fungal genera in the respiratory tract is observed in people with cystic fibrosis. Their bacterial flora often contains antibiotic-resistant and slow-growing bacteria, and the frequency of these pathogens changes in relation to age.

=== Biliary tract ===
Traditionally the biliary tract has been considered to be normally sterile, and the presence of microorganisms in bile is a marker of pathological process. This assumption was confirmed by failure in allocation of bacterial strains from the normal bile duct. Papers began emerging in 2013 showing that the normal biliary microbiota is a separate functional layer which protects a biliary tract from colonization by exogenous microorganisms.

== Disease and death ==
Human bodies rely on the innumerable bacterial genes as the source of essential nutrients. Both metagenomic and epidemiological studies indicate vital roles for the human microbiome in preventing a wide range of diseases, from type 2 diabetes and obesity to inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and even mental health conditions like depression. A symbiotic relationship between the gut microbiota and different bacteria may influence an individual&#x27;s immune response. Metabolites generated by gut microbes appear to be causative factors in type 2 diabetes. Although in its infancy, microbiome-based treatment is also showing promise, most notably for treating drug-resistant &quot;C. difficile&quot; infection and in diabetes treatment.

=== &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection ===
An overwhelming presence of the bacteria, &quot;C. difficile,&quot; leads to an infection of the gastrointestinal tract, normally associated to dysbiosis with the microbiota believed to have been caused by the administration of antibiotics. Use of antibiotics eradicates the beneficial gut flora within the gastrointestinal tract, which normally prevents pathogenic bacteria from establishing dominance. Traditional treatment for &quot;C. difficile&quot; infections includes an additional regime of antibiotics, however, efficacy rates average between 20 and 30%. Recognizing the importance of healthy gut bacteria, researchers turned to a procedure known as fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), where patients experiencing gastrointestinal diseases, such as &quot;C. difficile&quot; infection (CDI), receive fecal content from a healthy individual in hopes of restoring a normal functioning intestinal microbiota. Fecal microbiota transplant is approximately 85–90% effective in people with CDI for whom antibiotics have not worked or in whom the disease recurs following antibiotics. Most people with CDI recover with one FMT treatment.

=== Cancer ===
Although cancer is generally a disease of host genetics and environmental factors, microorganisms are implicated in some 20% of human cancers. Particularly for potential factors in colon cancer, bacterial density is one million times higher than in the small intestine, and approximately 12-fold more cancers occur in the colon compared to the small intestine, possibly establishing a pathogenic role for microbiota in colon and rectal cancers. Microbial density may be used as a prognostic tool in assessment of colorectal cancers.

The microbiota may affect carcinogenesis in three broad ways: (i) altering the balance of tumor cell proliferation and death, (ii) regulating immune system function, and (iii) influencing metabolism of host-produced factors, foods and pharmaceuticals. Tumors arising at boundary surfaces, such as the skin, oropharynx and respiratory, digestive and urogenital tracts, harbor a microbiota. Substantial microbe presence at a tumor site does not establish association or causal links. Instead, microbes may find tumor oxygen tension or nutrient profile supportive. Decreased populations of specific microbes or induced oxidative stress may also increase risks. Of the around 1030 microbes on earth, ten are designated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as human carcinogens. Microbes may secrete proteins or other factors directly drive cell proliferation in the host, or may up- or down-regulate the host immune system including driving acute or chronic inflammation in ways that contribute to carcinogenesis.

Concerning the relationship of immune function and development of inflammation, mucosal surface barriers are subject to environmental risks and must rapidly repair to maintain homeostasis. Compromised host or microbiota resiliency also reduce resistance to malignancy, possibly inducing inflammation and cancer. Once barriers are breached, microbes can elicit proinflammatory or immunosuppressive programs through various pathways. For example, cancer-associated microbes appear to activate NF-κΒ signaling within the tumor microenvironment. Other pattern recognition receptors, such as nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain–like receptor (NLR) family members &quot;NOD-2&quot;, &quot;NLRP3&quot;, &quot;NLRP6&quot; and &quot;NLRP12&quot;, may play a role in mediating colorectal cancer. Likewise &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; appears to increase the risk of gastric cancer, due to its driving a chronic inflammatory response in the stomach.

=== Inflammatory bowel disease ===
Inflammatory bowel disease consists of two different diseases: ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#x27;s disease and both of these diseases present with disruptions in the gut microbiota (also known as dysbiosis). This dysbiosis presents itself in the form of decreased microbial diversity in the gut, and is correlated to defects in host genes that changes the innate immune response in individuals.

===Human immunodeficiency virus===
The HIV disease progression influences the composition and function of the gut microbiota, with notable differences between HIV-negative, HIV-positive, and post-ART HIV-positive populations. HIV decreases the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier function by affecting tight junctions. This breakdown allows for translocation across the gut epithelium, which is thought to contribute to increases in inflammation seen in people with HIV.

Vaginal microbiota plays a role in the infectivity of HIV, with an increased risk of infection and transmission when the woman has bacterial vaginosis, a condition characterized by an abnormal balance of vaginal bacteria. The enhanced infectivity is seen with the increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and CCR5 + CD4+ cells in the vagina. However, a decrease in infectivity is seen with increased levels of vaginal &quot;Lactobacillus,&quot; which promotes an anti-inflammatory condition.

===Gut microbiome of centenarians===

Humans who are 100 years old or older, called centenarians, have a distinct gut microbiome. This microbiome is characteristically enriched in microorganisms that are able to synthesize novel secondary bile acids. These secondary bile acids include various isoforms of lithocholic acid that may contribute to healthy aging.

=== Death ===

With death, the microbiome of the living body collapses and a different composition of microorganisms named &quot;necrobiome&quot; establishes itself as an important active constituent of the complex physical decomposition process. Its predictable changes over time are thought to be useful to help determine the time of death.

== Environmental health ==
Studies in 2009 questioned whether the decline in biota (including microfauna) as a result of human intervention might impede human health, hospital safety procedures, food product design, and treatments of disease.

== Changes, modulation and transmission ==

Hygiene, probiotics,&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s41385-022-00564-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; prebiotics, synbiotics, light therapy, microbiota transplants (fecal or skin), antibiotics, exercise, diet, breastfeeding, aging can change the human microbiome across various anatomical systems or regions such as skin and gut.

=== Person-to-person transmission ===
The human microbiome is transmitted between a mother and her children, as well as between people living in the same household.

== Research ==

=== Migration ===
Primary research indicates that immediate changes in the microbiota may occur when a person migrates from one country to another, such as when Thai immigrants settled in the United States or when Latin Americans immigrated into the United States. Losses of microbiota diversity were greater in obese individuals and children of immigrants.

=== Cellulose digestion ===
A 2024 study suggests that gut microbiota capable of digesting cellulose can be found in the human microbiome, and they are less abundant in people living in industrialized societies.
===Sexome===
The sexome refers to microbes left on genitalia after penetrative sex. In the context of forensic science, the sexome can potentially aid in sexual assault casework for perpetrator identification when human male DNA is absent.

<text>The Oxenstierna family ( , ) is a Swedish noble family, originally from Småland in southern Sweden, and is part of the Swedish &quot;uradel&quot;, the ancient nobility.

== History ==
The Oxenstierna family held vast estates in Södermanland and Uppland during the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. In the 15th century, the family at times held the position of Regent of Sweden during the turbulent civil wars of the Kalmar Union. The family began to adopt its armorial designation of Oxenstierna as a personal surname towards the end of the 16th century. In the case of earlier members of the family, the surname has been retroactively applied by historians.

== Notable Oxenstierna family members ==

Several members of the family, most notably the influential Lord High Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, rose to prominence, high political office and titles during the age of the Swedish Empire in the 17th century.
The family&#x27;s most notable members include the following (in chronological order):

* Jöns Bengtsson (Oxenstierna) the Elder, (?–1399), knight.
* Bengt Jönsson Oxenstierna, (1390s–1450), statesman, Privy Councillor and Lawspeaker of Uppland, Co-regent of Sweden.

* Kristiern Bengtsson (Oxenstierna) the Younger, (c. 1475–1520), Privy Councillor, executed during the Stockholm Bloodbath.

* Axel Gustafsson Oxenstierna, 1st Count of Södermöre (1583–1654), influential statesman and Lord High Chancellor during the age of the Swedish Empire, head of the regency council and &quot;de facto&quot; regent during Queen Christina&#x27;s minority.
* Gabriel Gustafsson Oxenstierna, (1587–1640), statesman and Lord High Steward of Sweden, brother of Axel Gustafsson.

==Connection to European royal houses ==
Kings Christian IX of Denmark, Haakon VII of Norway, and Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden were all descended from branches of the Oxenstierna family. All three monarchs descended from the Oxenstierna family through their common ancestor, Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. His paternal grandmother was Countess Charlotte of Dohna-Schlobitten, great-great-granddaughter of Gabriel Bengtsson Oxenstierna, 1st Count of Korsholma and Vaasa, father of Bengt Gabrielsson and first cousin of Axel and Bengt Gustafssöner, as well as great-great-great-great-grandson of regent Bengt Jönsson. Oxenstierna was also a distant relative of Charles VIII of Sweden, Frederik VIII of Denmark, Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom, George I of Greece, and Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia.

<text>Lexical semantics (also known as lexicosemantics), as a subfield of linguistic semantics, is the study of word meanings. It includes the study of how words structure their meaning, how they act in grammar and compositionality, and the relationships between the distinct senses and uses of a word.

The units of analysis in lexical semantics are lexical units which include not only words but also sub-words or sub-units such as affixes and even compound words and phrases. Lexical units include the catalogue of words in a language, the lexicon. Lexical semantics looks at how the meaning of the lexical units correlates with the structure of the language or syntax. This is referred to as syntax-semantics interface.

The study of lexical semantics concerns:
* the classification and decomposition of lexical items
* the differences and similarities in lexical semantic structure cross-linguistically
* the relationship of lexical meaning to sentence meaning and syntax.

Lexical units, also referred to as syntactic atoms, can be independent such as in the case of root words or parts of compound words or they require association with other units, as prefixes and suffixes do. The former are termed free morphemes and the latter bound morphemes. They fall into a narrow range of meanings (semantic fields) and can combine with each other to generate new denotations.

Cognitive semantics is the linguistic paradigm/framework that since the 1980s has generated the most studies in lexical semantics, introducing innovations like prototype theory, conceptual metaphors, and frame semantics.

== Lexical relations ==

Lexical items contain information about category (lexical and syntactic), form and meaning. The semantics related to these categories then relate to each lexical item in the lexicon. Lexical items can also be semantically classified based on whether their meanings are derived from single lexical units or from their surrounding environment.

Lexical items participate in regular patterns of association with each other. Some relations between lexical items include hyponymy, hypernymy, synonymy, and antonymy, as well as homonymy.

=== Hyponymy and hypernymy ===
Hyponymy and hypernymy refer to a relationship between a general term and the more specific terms that fall under the category of the general term.

For example, the colors &quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;yellow&quot; are hyponyms. They fall under the general term of &quot;color&quot;, which is the hypernym.

Hyponyms and hypernyms can be described by using a taxonomy, as seen in the example.

=== Synonym ===
Synonym refers to words that are pronounced and spelled differently but contain the same meaning.
=== Antonym ===
Antonym refers to words that are related by having the opposite meanings to each other.
There are three types of antonyms: graded antonyms, complementary antonyms, and relational antonyms.
=== Homonymy ===
Homonymy refers to the relationship between words that are spelled or pronounced the same way but hold different meanings.
=== Polysemy ===
Polysemy refers to a word having two or more related meanings.

=== Semantic networks ===
Lexical semantics also explores whether the meaning of a lexical unit is established by looking at its neighbourhood in the semantic network, (words it occurs with in natural sentences), or whether the meaning is already locally contained in the lexical unit.

In English, WordNet is an example of a semantic network. It contains English words that are grouped into synsets. Some semantic relations between these synsets are meronymy, hyponymy, synonymy, and antonymy.

== Semantic fields ==

=== How lexical items map onto concepts ===
First proposed by Trier in the 1930s, semantic field theory proposes that a group of words with interrelated meanings can be categorized under a larger conceptual domain. This entire entity is thereby known as a semantic field. The words &quot;boil&quot;, &quot;bake&quot;, &quot;fry&quot;, and &quot;roast&quot;, for example, would fall under the larger semantic category of &quot;cooking&quot;. Semantic field theory asserts that lexical meaning cannot be fully understood by looking at a word in isolation, but by looking at a group of semantically related words. Semantic relations can refer to any relationship in meaning between lexemes, including synonymy &quot;(big&quot; and &quot;large),&quot; antonymy &quot;(big&quot; and &quot;small),&quot; hypernymy and hyponymy &quot;(rose&quot; and &quot;flower),&quot; converseness &quot;(buy&quot; and &quot;sell),&quot; and incompatibility. Semantic field theory does not have concrete guidelines that determine the extent of semantic relations between lexemes. The abstract validity of the theory is a subject of debate.

Knowing the meaning of a lexical item therefore means knowing the semantic entailments the word brings with it. However, it is also possible to understand only one word of a semantic field without understanding other related words. Take, for example, a taxonomy of plants and animals: it is possible to understand the words &quot;rose&quot; and &quot;rabbit&quot; without knowing what a &quot;marigold&quot; or a &quot;muskrat&quot; is. This is applicable to colors as well, such as understanding the word &quot;red&quot; without knowing the meaning of &quot;scarlet,&quot; but understanding &quot;scarlet&quot; without knowing the meaning of &quot;red&quot; may be less likely. A semantic field can thus be very large or very small, depending on the level of contrast being made between lexical items. While cat and dog both fall under the larger semantic field of animal, including the breed of dog, like &quot;German shepherd,&quot; would require contrasts between other breeds of dog (e.g. &quot;corgi&quot;, or &quot;poodle&quot;), thus expanding the semantic field further.

=== How lexical items map onto events ===
Event structure is defined as the semantic relation of a verb and its syntactic properties.
Event structure has three primary components:
* primitive event type of the lexical item
* event composition rules
* mapping rules to lexical structure
Verbs can belong to one of three types: states, processes, or transitions.

(1a) defines the state of the door being closed; there is no opposition in this predicate. (1b) and (1c) both have predicates showing transitions of the door going from being implicitly &quot;open&quot; to &quot;closed&quot;. (1b) gives the intransitive use of the verb close, with no explicit mention of the causer, but (1c) makes explicit mention of the agent involved in the action.

== Syntactic basis of event structure: a brief history ==

=== Generative semantics in the 1960s ===
The analysis of these different lexical units had a decisive role in the field of &quot;generative linguistics&quot; during the 1960s. The term &quot;generative&quot; was proposed by Noam Chomsky in his book Syntactic Structures published in 1957. The term &quot;generative linguistics&quot; was based on Chomsky&#x27;s generative grammar, a linguistic theory that states systematic sets of rules (X&#x27; theory) can predict grammatical phrases within a natural language. Generative Linguistics is also known as Government-Binding Theory.
Generative linguists of the 1960s, including Noam Chomsky and Ernst von Glasersfeld, believed semantic relations between transitive verbs and intransitive verbs were tied to their independent syntactic organization. This meant that they saw a simple verb phrase as encompassing a more complex syntactic structure.

=== Lexicalist theories in the 1980s ===
Lexicalist theories became popular during the 1980s, and emphasized that a word&#x27;s internal structure was a question of morphology and not of syntax. Lexicalist theories emphasized that complex words (resulting from compounding and derivation of affixes) have lexical entries that are derived from morphology, rather than resulting from overlapping syntactic and phonological properties, as Generative Linguistics predicts. The distinction between Generative Linguistics and Lexicalist theories can be illustrated by considering the transformation of the word &quot;destroy&quot; to &quot;destruction&quot;:

* Generative Linguistics theory: states the transformation of &quot;destroy&quot; → &quot;destruction&quot; as the nominal, &quot;nom&quot; + &quot;destroy,&quot; combined with phonological rules that produce the output &quot;destruction&quot;. Views this transformation as independent of the morphology.
* Lexicalist theory: sees &quot;destroy&quot; and &quot;destruction&quot; as having idiosyncratic lexical entries based on their differences in morphology. Argues that each morpheme contributes specific meaning. States that the formation of the complex word &quot;destruction&quot; is accounted for by a set of &quot;Lexical Rules,&quot; which are different and independent from syntactic rules.

A lexical entry lists the basic properties of either the whole word, or the individual properties of the morphemes that make up the word itself. The properties of lexical items include their category selection &quot;c-selection&quot;, selectional properties &quot;s-selection&quot;, (also known as semantic selection), phonological properties, and features. The properties of lexical items are idiosyncratic, unpredictable, and contain specific information about the lexical items that they describe.

The following is an example of a lexical entry for the verb &quot;put&quot;:
Lexicalist theories state that a word&#x27;s meaning is derived from its morphology or a speaker&#x27;s lexicon, and not its syntax. The degree of morphology&#x27;s influence on overall grammar remains controversial. Currently, the linguists that perceive one engine driving both morphological items and syntactic items are in the majority.

=== Micro-syntactic theories: 1990s to the present ===
By the early 1990s, Chomsky&#x27;s minimalist framework on language structure led to sophisticated probing techniques for investigating languages. These probing techniques analyzed negative data over prescriptive grammars, and because of Chomsky&#x27;s proposed Extended Projection Principle in 1986, probing techniques showed where specifiers of a sentence had moved to in order to fulfill the EPP. This allowed syntacticians to hypothesize that lexical items with complex syntactic features (such as ditransitive, inchoative, and causative verbs), could select their own specifier element within a syntax tree construction. (For more on probing techniques, see Suci, G., Gammon, P., &amp; Gamlin, P. (1979)).

This brought the focus back on the syntax-lexical semantics interface; however, syntacticians still sought to understand the relationship between complex verbs and their related syntactic structure, and to what degree the syntax was projected from the lexicon, as the Lexicalist theories argued.

In the mid 1990s, linguists Heidi Harley, Samuel Jay Keyser, and Kenneth Hale addressed some of the implications posed by complex verbs and a lexically-derived syntax. Their proposals indicated that the predicates CAUSE and BECOME, referred to as subunits within a Verb Phrase, acted as a lexical semantic template. &quot;Predicates&quot; are verbs and state or affirm something about the subject of the sentence or the argument of the sentence. For example, the predicates &quot;went&quot; and &quot;is here&quot; below affirm the argument of the subject and the state of the subject respectively.

The subunits of Verb Phrases led to the Argument Structure Hypothesis and Verb Phrase Hypothesis, both outlined below. The recursion found under the &quot;umbrella&quot; Verb Phrase, the VP Shell, accommodated binary-branching theory; another critical topic during the 1990s. Current theory recognizes the predicate in Specifier position of a tree in inchoative/anticausative verbs (intransitive), or causative verbs (transitive) is what selects the theta role conjoined with a particular verb.

==== Hale &amp; Keyser 1990 ====

Kenneth Hale and Samuel Jay Keyser introduced their thesis on lexical argument structure during the early 1990s.
They argue that a predicate&#x27;s argument structure is represented in the syntax, and that the syntactic representation of the predicate is a lexical projection of its arguments. Thus, the structure of a predicate is strictly a lexical representation, where each phrasal head projects its argument onto a phrasal level within the syntax tree. The selection of this phrasal head is based on Chomsky&#x27;s Empty Category Principle. This lexical projection of the predicate&#x27;s argument onto the syntactic structure is the foundation for the Argument Structure Hypothesis. This idea coincides with Chomsky&#x27;s Projection Principle, because it forces a VP to be selected locally and be selected by a Tense Phrase (TP).

Based on the interaction between lexical properties, locality, and the properties of the EPP (where a phrasal head selects another phrasal element locally), Hale and Keyser make the claim that the Specifier position or a complement are the only two semantic relations that project a predicate&#x27;s argument. In 2003, Hale and Keyser put forward this hypothesis and argued that a lexical unit must have one or the other, Specifier or Complement, but cannot have both.

==== Halle &amp; Marantz 1993 ====
Morris Halle and Alec Marantz introduced the notion of distributed morphology in 1993. This theory views the syntactic structure of words as a result of morphology and semantics, instead of the morpho-semantic interface being predicted by the syntax. Essentially, the idea that under the Extended Projection Principle there is a local boundary under which a special meaning occurs. This meaning can only occur if a head-projecting morpheme is present within the local domain of the syntactic structure. The following is an example of the tree structure proposed by distributed morphology for the sentence &quot;John&#x27;s destroying the city&quot;. &quot;Destroy&quot; is the root, V-1 represents verbalization, and D represents nominalization.

==== Ramchand 2008 ====
In her 2008 book, &quot;Verb Meaning and The Lexicon: A First-Phase Syntax&quot;, linguist Gillian Ramchand acknowledges the roles of lexical entries in the selection of complex verbs and their arguments. &#x27;First-Phase&#x27; syntax proposes that event structure and event participants are directly represented in the syntax by means of binary branching. This branching ensures that the Specifier is the consistently subject, even when investigating the projection of a complex verb&#x27;s lexical entry and its corresponding syntactic construction. This generalization is also present in Ramchand&#x27;s theory that the complement of a head for a complex verb phrase must co-describe the verb&#x27;s event.

Ramchand also introduced the concept of Homomorphic Unity, which refers to the structural synchronization between the head of a complex verb phrase and its complement. According to Ramchand, Homomorphic Unity is &quot;when two event descriptors are syntactically Merged, the structure of the complement must unify with the structure of the head.&quot;

== Classification of event types ==

=== Intransitive verbs: unaccusative versus unergative ===
The unaccusative hypothesis was put forward by David Perlmutter in 1987, and describes how two classes of intransitive verbs have two different syntactic structures. These are unaccusative verbs and unergative verbs. These classes of verbs are defined by Perlmutter only in syntactic terms. They have the following structures underlyingly:

* unaccusative verb: __ [VP V NP]
* unergative verb: NP [VP V]

The following is an example from English:

In (2a) the verb underlyingly takes a direct object, while in (2b) the verb underlyingly takes a subject.

=== Transitivity alternations: the inchoative/causative alternation ===

The change-of-state property of Verb Phrases (VP) is a significant observation for the syntax of lexical semantics because it provides evidence that subunits are embedded in the VP structure, and that the meaning of the entire VP is influenced by this internal grammatical structure. (For example, the VP &quot;the vase broke&quot; carries a change-of-state meaning of the vase becoming broken, and thus has a silent BECOME subunit within its underlying structure.) There are two types of change-of-state predicates: inchoative and causative.

Inchoative verbs are intransitive, meaning that they occur without a direct object, and these verbs express that their subject has undergone a certain change of state. Inchoative verbs are also known as anticausative verbs. Causative verbs are transitive, meaning that they occur with a direct object, and they express that the subject causes a change of state in the object.

Linguist Martin Haspelmath classifies inchoative/causative verb pairs under three main categories: causative, anticausative, and non-directed alternations. Non-directed alternations are further subdivided into labile, equipollent, and suppletive alternations.

English tends to favour labile alternations, meaning that the same verb is used in the inchoative and causative forms. This can be seen in the following example: &quot;broke&quot; is an intransitive inchoative verb in (3a) and a transitive causative verb in (3b).

As seen in the underlying tree structure for (3a), the silent subunit BECOME is embedded within the Verb Phrase (VP), resulting in the inchoative change-of-state meaning (y become z). In the underlying tree structure for (3b), the silent subunits CAUS and BECOME are both embedded within the VP, resulting in the causative change-of-state meaning (x cause y become z).

English change of state verbs are often de-adjectival, meaning that they are derived from adjectives. We can see this in the following example:

In example (4a) we start with a stative intransitive adjective, and derive (4b) where we see an intransitive inchoative verb. In (4c) we see a transitive causative verb.

==== Marked inchoatives ====
Some languages (e.g., German, Italian, and French), have multiple morphological classes of inchoative verbs. Generally speaking, these languages separate their inchoative verbs into three classes: verbs that are obligatorily unmarked (they are not marked with a reflexive pronoun, clitic, or affix), verbs that are optionally marked, and verbs that are obligatorily marked. The causative verbs in these languages remain unmarked. Haspelmath refers to this as the anticausative alternation.

For example, inchoative verbs in German are classified into three morphological classes. &quot;Class A&quot; verbs necessarily form inchoatives with the reflexive pronoun &#x27;, &quot;Class B&quot; verbs form inchoatives necessarily without the reflexive pronoun, and &quot;Class C&quot; verbs form inchoatives optionally with or without the reflexive pronoun. In example (5), the verb &#x27; is an unmarked inchoative verb from &quot;Class B&quot;, which also remains unmarked in its causative form.

: German

In contrast, the verb &quot;öffnete&quot; is a &quot;Class A&quot; verb which necessarily takes the reflexive pronoun &quot;sich&quot; in its inchoative form, but remains unmarked in its causative form.

: German

There has been some debate as to whether the different classes of inchoative verbs are purely based in morphology, or whether the differentiation is derived from the lexical-semantic properties of each individual verb. While this debate is still unresolved in languages such as Italian, French, and Greek, it has been suggested by linguist Florian Schäfer that there are semantic differences between marked and unmarked inchoatives in German. Specifically, that only unmarked inchoative verbs allow an unintentional causer reading (meaning that they can take on an &quot;x unintentionally caused y&quot; reading).

==== Marked causatives ====

Causative morphemes are present in the verbs of many languages (e.g., Tagalog, Malagasy, Turkish, etc.), usually appearing in the form of an affix on the verb. This can be seen in the following examples from Tagalog, where the causative prefix &quot;pag-&quot; (realized here as &quot;nag&quot;) attaches to the verb &quot;tumba&quot; to derive a causative transitive verb in (7b), but the prefix does not appear in the inchoative intransitive verb in (7a). Haspelmath refers to this as the causative alternation.

: Tagalog

=== Ditransitive verbs ===

==== Kayne&#x27;s 1981 unambiguous path analysis ====

Richard Kayne proposed the idea of unambiguous paths as an alternative to c-commanding relationships, which is the type of structure seen in examples (8). The idea of unambiguous paths stated that an antecedent and an anaphor should be connected via an unambiguous path. This means that the line connecting an antecedent and an anaphor cannot be broken by another argument. When applied to ditransitive verbs, this hypothesis introduces the structure in diagram (8a). In this tree structure it can be seen that the same path can be traced from either DP to the verb. Tree diagram (7b) illustrates this structure with an example from English. This analysis was a step toward binary branching trees, which was a theoretical change that was furthered by Larson&#x27;s VP-shell analysis.

==== Larson&#x27;s 1988 &quot;VP-shell&quot; analysis ====

Larson posited his Single Complement Hypothesis in which he stated that every complement is introduced with one verb. The Double Object Construction presented in 1988 gave clear evidence of a hierarchical structure using asymmetrical binary branching. Sentences with double objects occur with ditransitive verbs, as we can see in the following example:
It appears as if the verb &quot;send&quot; has two objects, or complements (arguments): both &quot;Mary&quot;, the recipient and &quot;parcel&quot;, the theme. The argument structure of ditransitive verb phrases is complex and has undergone different structural hypothesis.

The original structural hypothesis was that of ternary branching seen in (9a) and (9b), but following from Kayne&#x27;s 1981 analysis, Larson maintained that each complement is introduced by a verb.

Their hypothesis shows that there is a lower verb embedded within a VP shell that combines with an upper verb (can be invisible), thus creating a VP shell (as seen in the tree diagram to the right). Most current theories no longer allow the ternary tree structure of (9a) and (9b), so the theme and the goal/recipient are seen in a hierarchical relationship within a binary branching structure.

Following are examples of Larson&#x27;s tests to show that the hierarchical (superior) order of any two objects aligns with a linear order, so that the second is governed (c-commanded) by the first. This is in keeping with X&#x27;Bar Theory of Phrase Structure Grammar, with Larson&#x27;s tree structure using the empty Verb to which the V is raised.

Reflexives and reciprocals (anaphors) show this relationship in which they must be c-commanded by their antecedents, such that the (10a) is grammatical but (10b) is not:

A pronoun must have a quantifier as its antecedent:

Question words follow this order:
The effect of negative polarity means that &quot;any&quot; must have a negative quantifier as an antecedent:
These tests with ditransitive verbs that confirm c-command also confirm the presence of underlying or invisible causative verbs. In ditransitive verbs such as &quot;give someone something&quot;, &quot;send someone something&quot;, &quot;show someone something&quot; etc. there is an underlying causative meaning that is represented in the underlying structure. As seen in example in (9a) above, &quot;John sent Mary a package&quot;, there is the underlying meaning that &#x27;John &quot;caused&quot; Mary to have a package&#x27;.

Larson proposed that both sentences in (9a) and (9b) share the same underlying structure and the difference on the surface lies in that the double object construction &quot;John sent Mary a package&quot; is derived by transformation from a NP plus PP construction &quot;John sent a package to Mary&quot;.

==== Beck &amp; Johnson&#x27;s 2004 double object construction ====

Beck and Johnson, however, give evidence that the two underlying structures are not the same. In so doing, they also give further evidence of the presence of two VPs where the verb attaches to a causative verb. In examples (14a) and (b), each of the double object constructions are alternated with NP + PP constructions.

Beck and Johnson show that the object in (15a) has a different relation to the motion verb as it is not able to carry the meaning of HAVING which the possessor (9a) and (15a) can. In (15a), Satoshi is an animate possessor and so is caused to HAVE kisimen. The PP &quot;for Satoshi&quot; in (15b) is of a benefactive nature and does not necessarily carry this meaning of HAVE either.

The underlying structures are therefore not the same. The differences lie in the semantics and the syntax of the sentences, in contrast to the transformational theory of Larson. Further evidence for the structural existence of VP shells with an invisible verbal unit is given in the application of the adjunct or modifier &quot;again&quot;. Sentence (16) is ambiguous and looking into the two different meanings reveals a difference in structure.
However, in (17a), it is clear that it was Sally who repeated the action of opening the door. In (17b), the event is in the door being opened and Sally may or may not have opened it previously. To render these two different meanings, &quot;again&quot; attaches to VPs in two different places, and thus describes two events with a purely structural change.

<text>This is a list of international dialing prefixes used in various countries for direct dialing of international telephone calls. These prefixes are typically required only when dialling from a landline, while in GSM-compliant mobile phone (cell phone) systems, the symbol &quot;+&quot; before the country code may be used irrespective of where the telephone is used at that moment; the network operator provides the access codes automatically.

==Countries by international prefix==
== Countries using carrier selection codes ==
The following is a non-exhaustive list of countries that optionally allow for carrier selection in addition to using the standard prefix listed in the preceding section.

==Historic international prefixes==
The following are international call prefixes that were used in various countries sometime in the past but are no longer used.
