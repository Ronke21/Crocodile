<text>Aaron Benjamin Sorkin (born June 9, 1961) is an American playwright, screenwriter, and film director. Born in New York City, he developed a passion for writing at an early age. As a writer for stage, television, and film, Sorkin is recognized for his trademark fast-paced dialogue and extended monologues, complemented by frequent use of the storytelling technique called the &quot;walk and talk&quot;. Sorkin has earned numerous accolades including an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, five Primetime Emmy Awards, and three Golden Globes.

Sorkin rose to prominence as a writer-creator and showrunner of the television series &quot;Sports Night&quot; (1998–2000), &quot;The West Wing&quot; (1999–2006), &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot; (2006–07), and &quot;The Newsroom&quot; (2012–14)&quot;.&quot; He is also known for his work on Broadway including the plays &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; (1989), &quot;The Farnsworth Invention&quot; (2007), &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; (2018), and the revival of Lerner and Loewe&#x27;s musical &quot;Camelot&quot; (2023).

He wrote the film screenplays for &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; (1992), &quot;The American President&quot; (1995), and several biopics including &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot; (2007), &quot;Moneyball&quot; (2011), and &quot;Steve Jobs&quot; (2015). For writing &quot;The Social Network&quot; (2010), he won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. He made his directorial film debut with &quot;Molly&#x27;s Game&quot; (2017), followed by &quot;The Trial of the Chicago 7&quot; (2020) and &quot;Being the Ricardos&quot; (2021).

==Early life==
Sorkin was born in Manhattan, New York City, to a Jewish family, and was raised in the New York suburb of Scarsdale. His mother was a schoolteacher and his father a copyright lawyer who had fought in WWII and went to college on the G.I. Bill; both his older sister and brother went on to become lawyers. His paternal grandfather was one of the founders of the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union (ILGWU). Sorkin took an early interest in acting. During childhood, his parents took him to the theatre to see shows such as &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; and &quot;That Championship Season&quot;.

Sorkin attended Scarsdale High School where he became involved in the drama and theatre club. In the eighth grade, he played General Bullmoose in the musical &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;. At Scarsdale High, he served as vice president of the drama club in his junior and senior years, and graduated in 1979.

In 1979, Sorkin attended Syracuse University. In his freshman year, he failed a class that was a core requirement, which caused a setback because he wanted to be an actor, and the drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed the core classes. Determined to do better, he returned for his sophomore year, and graduated in 1983 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in musical theatre. Recalling the influence of theatre teacher Arthur Storch, Sorkin said: &quot;Arthur&#x27;s reputation as a director, and as a disciple of Lee Strasberg, was a big reason why a lot of us went to S.U. [Syracuse University]... &#x27;You have the capacity to be so much better than you are&#x27;, he started saying to me in September of my senior year. He was still saying it in May. On the last day of classes, he said it again, and I said, &#x27;How?&#x27;, and he answered, &#x27;Dare to fail&#x27;. I&#x27;ve been coming through on his admonition ever since&quot;.

== Career ==

===1983–1990: Early work and breakthrough===

Sorkin moved to New York City where he spent much of the 1980s as a struggling, sporadically employed actor who worked odd jobs, such as delivering singing telegrams, driving a limousine, touring Alabama with the children&#x27;s theatre company Traveling Playhouse, handing out flyers promoting a hunting-and-fishing show, and bartending at Broadway&#x27;s Palace Theatre. One weekend, while house-sitting for a friend, he found an IBM Selectric typewriter, started typing, and &quot;felt a phenomenal confidence and a kind of joy that [he] had never experienced before in [his] life&quot;.

He continued writing and eventually put together his first play, &quot;Removing All Doubt,&quot; which he sent to his former theatre teacher, Arthur Storch, who was impressed. In 1984, &quot;Removing All Doubt&quot; was staged for drama students at his alma mater, Syracuse University. After that, he wrote &quot;Hidden in This Picture&quot; which debuted off-off-Broadway at Steve Olsen&#x27;s West Bank Cafe Downstairs Theatre Bar in New York City in 1988. The quality of his first two plays earned him a theatrical agent. Producer John A. McQuiggan saw the production of &quot;Hidden in This Picture&quot; and commissioned Sorkin to turn the one-act into a full-length play called &quot;Making Movies&quot;.

Sorkin was inspired to write his next play, a courtroom drama called &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah, who had graduated from Boston University Law School and signed up for a three-year stint with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps. Deborah told Sorkin that she was going to Guantanamo Bay to defend a group of Marines who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre. He and his roommates had purchased a Macintosh 512K; when he returned home, he would transcribe the story and notes onto the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;.

In 1988, Sorkin sold the film rights for &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; to producer David Brown before it premiered, in a deal that was reportedly &quot;well into six figures&quot;. Brown had read an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about Sorkin&#x27;s one-act play &quot;Hidden in This Picture,&quot; and found out Sorkin had a play called &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; that was having Off Broadway readings. Brown produced &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; on Broadway at the Music Box Theatre. It starred Tom Hulce and was directed by Don Scardino. After opening in late 1989, it ran for 497 performances. Sorkin continued writing &quot;Making Movies&quot; and in 1990 it debuted Off-Broadway at the Promenade Theatre, produced by John A. McQuiggan, and again directed by Don Scardino. Meanwhile, Brown was producing for TriStar Pictures, and tried to interest them in adapting &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; into a film, but his proposal was declined due to the lack of star actor involvement. Brown later received a phone call from Alan Horn at Castle Rock Entertainment who was eager to make the film. Rob Reiner, a Castle Rock producing partner, opted to direct.

===1991–1997: Writing for Castle Rock Entertainment===

Sorkin worked under contract for Castle Rock Entertainment, where he befriended colleagues William Goldman and Rob Reiner, and met his future wife Julia Bingham, who was one of Castle Rock&#x27;s business affairs lawyers. Sorkin wrote several drafts of the script for &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; in his Manhattan apartment, learning the craft from a book about screenplay format. He then spent several months at the Los Angeles offices of Castle Rock, working on the script with director Rob Reiner. William Goldman (who regularly worked under contract at Castle Rock) became his mentor and helped him to adapt his stage play into a screenplay. The film, directed by Reiner, starred Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore and Kevin Bacon, and was produced by Brown. &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; was released in 1992 and was a box office success, grossing $243 million worldwide.

Goldman also approached Sorkin with a story premise, which Sorkin developed into the script for the thriller &quot;Malice&quot;. Goldman oversaw the project as creative consultant while Sorkin wrote the first two drafts. However, he had to leave the project to finish the script for &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, so screenwriter Scott Frank stepped in and wrote two drafts of the &quot;Malice&quot; screenplay. When production on &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; was completed, Sorkin resumed working on &quot;Malice&quot; right through the final shooting script. Harold Becker directed the 1993 thriller, which starred Nicole Kidman and Alec Baldwin. &quot;Malice&quot; had mixed reviews; Vincent Canby in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as &quot;deviously entertaining from its start through its finish&quot;. Critic Roger Ebert gave it 2 out of 4 stars, and Peter Travers in a 2000 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review summarized it as having &quot;suspense but no staying power&quot;.

Sorkin&#x27;s last screenplay under Castle Rock was &quot;The American President;&quot; once again he worked with William Goldman who served as a creative consultant. It took Sorkin several years to write the screenplay for &quot;The American President&quot;, which started off at 385-pages; it was eventually reduced to a standard shooting script of around 120 pages. The film, also directed by Reiner, was critically acclaimed; Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described it as &quot;genial and entertaining if not notably inspired&quot;, and believed its most interesting aspects were the &quot;pipe dreams about the American political system and where it could theoretically be headed&quot;. &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, &quot;Malice&quot; and &quot;The American President&quot; grossed approximately $400 million worldwide.

In the second half of the 1990s, Sorkin worked as a script doctor. He wrote some quips for Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage in 1996&#x27;s &quot;The Rock&quot;. He worked on &quot;Excess Baggage&quot;, a 1997 comedy about a girl who stages her own kidnapping to get her father&#x27;s attention, and rewrote some of Will Smith&#x27;s scenes in &quot;Enemy of the State&quot;. Sorkin collaborated with Warren Beatty on several scripts, one of which was 1998&#x27;s &quot;Bulworth&quot;. Beatty, known for occasionally personally financing his film projects through pre-production, also hired Sorkin to rewrite a script titled &quot;Ocean of Storms&quot; which never went into production. At one point, Sorkin sued Beatty for proper compensation for his work on the &quot;Ocean of Storms&quot; script; once the matter was settled, he resumed working on the script.

=== 1998–2006: Television series and theatre work ===
====&quot;Sports Night&quot;====

Sorkin conceived the idea to write about the behind-the-scenes happenings on a sports show while residing at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles writing the screenplay for &quot;The American President&quot;. He would work late, with the television tuned into ESPN, watching continuous replays of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. The show inspired him to try to write a feature film about a sports show but he was unable to structure the story for film, so instead he turned his idea into a television comedy series. &quot;Sports Night&quot; was produced by Disney and debuted on the ABC network in fall of 1998.

Sorkin fought with ABC during the first season over the use of a laugh track and a live studio audience. The laugh track was widely decried by critics as jarring, with Joyce Millman of &quot;Salon&quot; magazine describing it as &quot;the most unconvincing laugh track you&#x27;ve ever heard&quot;. Sorkin commented that: &quot;Once you do shoot in front of a live audience, you have no choice but to use the laugh track. Oftentimes [enhancing the laughs] is the right thing to do. Sometimes you do need a cymbal crash. Other times, it alienates me.&quot; The laugh track was gradually dialed down and was removed by the end of the first season. Sorkin was triumphant in the second season when ABC agreed to his demands, unburdening the crew of the difficulties of staging a scene for a live audience and leaving the cast with more time to rehearse. Although &quot;Sports Night&quot; was critically acclaimed, ABC canceled the show after two seasons due to low ratings. Sorkin entertained offers to continue the show on other television channels, but declined all the offers because they were dependent on his involvement and he was already working on &quot;The West Wing&quot;.

====&quot;The West Wing&quot;====

Sorkin conceived the political drama &quot;The West Wing&quot; in 1997 when he went unprepared to a lunch with producer John Wells; in a panic he pitched to Wells a series centered on the senior staff of the White House, using leftover ideas from his script for &quot;The American President&quot;. He told Wells about his visits to the White House while doing research for &quot;The American President&quot;, and they found themselves discussing public service and the passion of the people who serve. Wells took the concept and pitched it to NBC, but was told to wait due to the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. There was a concern that television audiences would not be able to take a series about the White House seriously. A year later, other networks started showing interest in &quot;The West Wing.&quot; NBC decided to give the project the green-light despite their previous reluctance. The pilot debuted in the fall of 1999 and was produced by Warner Bros. Television.

&quot;The West Wing&quot; garnered nine Primetime Emmy Awards for its debut season, making the series a record holder for most Emmys won by a series in a single season at the time. Following the awards ceremony, there was a dispute about the acceptance speech for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. &quot;The West Wing&quot; episode &quot;In Excelsis Deo&quot; won, which was awarded to Sorkin and Rick Cleveland, but &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Sorkin ushered Cleveland off the stage before he could say a few words. The story behind &quot;In Excelsis Deo&quot; is based on Cleveland&#x27;s father, a Korean War veteran who spent the last years of his life on the street, as Cleveland explained in an essay titled &quot;I Was the Dumb Looking Guy with the Wire-Rimmed Glasses&quot;. Sorkin and Cleveland continued their dispute in a public web forum at Mighty Big TV in which Sorkin explained that he gives his writers &quot;Story By&quot; credit on a rotating basis &quot;by way of a gratuity&quot; and that he had thrown out Cleveland&#x27;s script and started from scratch. Sorkin eventually apologized to Cleveland. Cleveland and Sorkin also won the Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Episodic Drama at the 53rd Writer Guild of America Awards for &quot;In Excelsis Deo&quot;.

In 2001, after completing the second season of &quot;The West Wing&quot;, Sorkin had a drug relapse, and was arrested at Hollywood Burbank Airport for possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, and crack cocaine. He was ordered by a court to attend a drug diversion program. There was huge media interest but he did make a successful recovery. In 2002, Sorkin criticized NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw&#x27;s television special about a day in the life of a president, &quot;The Bush White House: Inside the Real West Wing&quot;, comparing it to the act of sending a valentine to President George W. Bush instead of real news reporting. &quot;The West Wing&quot; aired on the same network, and so at the request of NBC&#x27;s Entertainment President Jeff Zucker, Sorkin apologized, but later said, &quot;there should be a difference between what NBC News does and what &quot;The West Wing&quot; TV series does.&quot;

Sorkin wrote 87 screenplays for &quot;The West Wing&quot;, which is nearly every episode during the show&#x27;s first four Emmy-winning seasons. Sorkin described his role in the creative process as &quot;not so much [that of] a showrunner or a producer. I&#x27;m really a writer.&quot; He admitted that this approach can have its drawbacks, saying &quot;Out of 88 [&quot;West Wing&quot;] episodes that I did we were on time and on budget never, not once.&quot; In 2003, at the end of the fourth season, Sorkin and fellow executive producer Thomas Schlamme left the show due to internal conflicts at Warner Bros. Television, causing John Wells to serve as showrunner. Sorkin never watched any episodes beyond his writing tenure apart from a minute of the fifth season&#x27;s first episode, describing the experience as &quot;like watching somebody make out with my girlfriend.&quot; Sorkin later returned in the series finale for a cameo appearance as a guest at the inauguration of Matthew Santos.

====&quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot; ====
In 2005, Sorkin returned to theatre; he revised his play &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; for a production at London&#x27;s West End. The play opened at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in the fall of the same year and was directed by David Esbjornson, with Rob Lowe of &quot;The West Wing&quot; in the lead role. Sorkin told &quot;The Charlie Rose Show&quot; that he was developing a television series based on a late-night sketch comedy show similar to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In October 2005, a pilot script dubbed &quot;Studio 7 on the Sunset Strip&quot;, written by him and Schlamme as producer, started circulating in Hollywood and online. In that same month, NBC bought the rights from Warner Bros. Television to air the series on their network for a near-record license fee after a bidding war with CBS. The show&#x27;s name was later changed to &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;. Sorkin described the show as having &quot;autobiographical elements&quot; to it and &quot;characters that are based on actual people&quot; but said that it departs from those beginnings to look at the backstage maneuverings at a late night sketch comedy show.

On September 18, 2006, the pilot for &quot;Studio 60&quot; aired on NBC, directed by Schlamme. The pilot was critically acclaimed and viewed by an audience of over 12 million, but the show experienced a significant drop in viewership mid-season. Even before the first episode aired, there was a large amount of thoughtful and scrupulous criticism in the press, as well as negative analysis from bloggers. In January 2007, Sorkin spoke out against the press for reporting heavily on the low ratings, and for using blogs and unemployed comedy writers as sources. After two months hiatus, &quot;Studio 60&quot; resumed airing the last episodes of season one, which would be its only season.

==== &quot;The Farnsworth Invention&quot; ====
As early as 2003, Sorkin was writing a spec script about inventor Philo Farnsworth; he was approached by producer Fred Zollo in the 1990s about adapting Elma Farnsworth&#x27;s memoir into a biographical film. The following year, he completed the film screenplay, &quot;The Farnsworth Invention&quot;, which was acquired by New Line Cinema with Schlamme as director. The story is about the patent battle between Farnsworth and RCA tycoon David Sarnoff for the technology that allowed the first television transmissions in the United States. No additional details were released about the film. Shortly, Sorkin was contacted by Jocelyn Clarke of the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, requesting he write a play for them, a commission which he accepted. Sorkin decided to rewrite &quot;The Farnsworth Invention&quot; as a play. He delivered a first draft of the play to the Abbey Theatre in early 2005, and a production was planned for 2007 with La Jolla Playhouse deciding to stage a workshop production of the play in collaboration with the Abbey Theatre. In 2006, Abbey Theatre&#x27;s new management quit involvement with &quot;The Farnsworth Invention&quot;. Despite this, La Jolla Playhouse carried on with Steven Spielberg serving as a producer. The production opened under La Jolla&#x27;s signature Page To Stage program which allowed Sorkin and director Des McAnuff to develop the play from show-to-show according to audience reactions and feedback; the play ran from February 20, 2007, through March 25, 2007. A Broadway production followed soon after, beginning in previews, and opening on November 14, 2007; however, the play was delayed by the 2007 Broadway stagehand strike. &quot;The Farnsworth Invention&quot; eventually opened at the Music Box Theatre on December 3, 2007, and closed on March 2, 2008.

=== 2007–2015: Return to film and &quot;The Newsroom&quot; ===

In 2007, Sorkin was commissioned by Universal Pictures to adapt George Crile&#x27;s non-fiction book &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot; for Tom Hanks&#x27; production company Playtone. The biographical comedy, &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War,&quot; is about the colorful Texas congressman Charlie Wilson who funded the CIA&#x27;s secret war against the former Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Directed by Mike Nichols, and written by Sorkin, the film was released in 2007 and starred Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts and Philip Seymour Hoffman. The film earned five nominations at the Golden Globes, including Best Screenplay for Sorkin.

In August 2008, Sorkin announced that he had agreed to write a script for Sony Pictures and producer Scott Rudin about the beginnings of Facebook. David Fincher&#x27;s &quot;The Social Network&quot;, based on Ben Mezrich&#x27;s non fiction book &quot;The Accidental Billionaires&quot;, was released on October 1, 2010. It was a critical and commercial success; Sorkin won an Academy Award, BAFTA and a Golden Globe for the screenplay.

A year later, Sorkin received nominations in the same award categories for co-writing &quot;Moneyball&quot;. It is based on Michael Lewis&#x27;s 2003 non-fiction , an account of the Oakland Athletics baseball team&#x27;s 2002 season and their general manager Billy Beane&#x27;s attempts to assemble a competitive team. The film was directed by Bennett Miller, and starred Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the script &quot;dynamite&quot;, in which Sorkin&#x27;s &quot;sharply witty touch is everywhere&quot;.

In 2011, Sorkin played himself on the series &quot;30 Rock,&quot; episode &quot;Plan B&quot;, where he did a &quot;walk and talk&quot; with Liz Lemon played by Tina Fey. While still working on the screenplay for &quot;The Social Network&quot;, Sorkin was contemplating a television drama about the behind-the-scenes events at a cable news program. Talks had been ongoing between Sorkin and HBO since 2010. To research the news industry, Sorkin observed the production crew at MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;, and quizzed &quot;Parker Spitzer&quot;″s staff. He also spent time shadowing &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews,&quot; as well as other programs on Fox News and CNN. Sorkin told &quot;TV Guide&quot; that he intended to take a less cynical view of the media: &quot;They&#x27;re going to be trying to do well in a context where it&#x27;s very difficult to do well when there are commercial concerns and political concerns and corporate concerns.&quot; Sorkin decided that rather than have his characters react to fictional news events as on his earlier series, it would be set in the recent past and track real-world stories largely as they unfolded, to give a greater sense of realism.HBO ordered a pilot episode in January 2011 with the working title &quot;More as This Story Develops,&quot; with Scott Rudin serving as an executive producer. In September, HBO ordered a 10-episode series of &quot;The Newsroom&quot; with a premiere date of June 2012. A day after the second episode aired, HBO renewed the series for a second season. Sorkin said &quot;The Newsroom&quot; &quot;is meant to be an idealistic, romantic, swashbuckling, sometimes comedic but very optimistic, upward-looking look at a group of people who are often looked at cynically. The same as with &quot;The West Wing&quot;, where ordinarily in popular culture our leaders are portrayed either as Machiavellian or dumb; I wanted to do something different and show a highly competent group of people.&quot; The series concluded after its third season.

In 2015, Danny Boyle&#x27;s biographical drama &quot;Steve Jobs&quot; was released. The screenplay by Sorkin was based on Walter Isaacson&#x27;s biography of Steve Jobs, and starred Michael Fassbender as Jobs, Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman, Jeff Daniels as John Sculley, and Seth Rogen as Steve Wozniak. Sorkin expressed hesitation for tackling the film, saying &quot;it was a little like writing about the Beatles—that there are so many people out there who know so much about him [Jobs] and who revere him that I just saw a minefield of disappointment. [...] Hopefully, when I&#x27;m done with my research, I&#x27;ll be in the same ball park of knowledge about Steve Jobs&quot;. He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay, although some journalists were surprised that he did not receive an Academy Award nomination in the same category.

=== 2016–present: Film directing debut and Broadway work ===
==== &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; ====
In February 2016, it was announced that Sorkin would adapt Harper Lee&#x27;s &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; for the stage, reuniting with Jeff Daniels, who would portray Atticus Finch. This would be Sorkin&#x27;s first collaboration with director Bartlett Sher. His Broadway adaptation opened on December 13, 2018, to positive reviews at the Shubert Theatre. The play received nine Tony Award nominations, although notably not for Best Play. Despite initial legal disputes with the Harper Lee estate and controversy regarding actions by producer Scott Rudin, the play was a financial success where it transferred to the West End and embarked on a national tour. The play returned to Broadway following the COVID-19 pandemic, with Daniels returning to the role.

==== Work as film director ====
Next, Sorkin made his directorial debut with &quot;Molly&#x27;s Game&quot;, an adaptation of entrepreneur Molly Bloom&#x27;s memoir. He also wrote the script for the film, which starred Jessica Chastain and Idris Elba. Production began in 2016 and the film was released in December 2017 to mostly positive reviews; Sorkin received his third Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Molly&#x27;s Game&quot; garnered an approval rating of 81% based on 297 reviews, with an average rating of 7.07/10.

Sorkin told &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in July 2020 that Steven Spielberg offered him a job in 2006 about &quot;a movie about the riots at the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention and the trial that followed&quot;. However, after meeting at Spielberg&#x27;s home, Sorkin said, &quot;I left not knowing what the hell he was talking about.&quot; On July 12, 2007, &quot;Variety&quot; magazine reported that Sorkin had signed a deal with DreamWorks to write three scripts. The first was &quot;The Trial of the Chicago 7&quot;, which Sorkin was already developing with Spielberg, Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald. In March 2010, Sorkin&#x27;s agent, Ari Emanuel, had stated that the project was proving &quot;tough to get together&quot;. In late July 2013, it was announced that Paul Greengrass would be directing, but Sorkin eventually both wrote and directed the film. Focusing on the Chicago Seven (and Bobby Seale), the film began a limited release on September 25, 2020, before streaming on Netflix. At the 78th Golden Globes, Sorkin won Best Screenplay, and was nominated for Best Director.

In September 2015, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reported that Sorkin was writing a biopic that would focus on the twenty-year marriage of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, and their work on a comedy series, &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. Cate Blanchett was originally to star as Ball. In 2017, Amazon Studios acquired the rights to the film. In January 2021, it was announced that Blanchett had been replaced by Nicole Kidman, and Javier Bardem had been cast as Desi Arnaz. Titled &quot;Being the Ricardos&quot; (2021), it was directed by Sorkin and received a limited theatrical release on December 10, 2021, before streaming on Prime Video on December 21. Paul Byrnes of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; praised the film&#x27;s dialogue, while the critic from &quot;The Irish Times&quot; opined that the film lacked &quot;spark or insight&quot;.

==== &quot;Camelot&quot; ====
It was announced that Sorkin would be reuniting with director Bartlett Sher to write a revised book for the Broadway revival of the Lerner and Loewe musical &quot;Camelot&quot; starring Phillipa Soo and Andrew Burnap. The production was set to begin at Lincoln Center&#x27;s Vivian Beaumont Theater on November 3, 2022, but was moved back to April 13, 2023.

==Prospective projects==
In March 2007, it was reported that Sorkin had signed on to write a musical adaptation of the hit 2002 record &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot; by psychedelic-rock band The Flaming Lips, collaborating with director Des McAnuff who had been developing the project. In August 2008, McAnuff announced that Sorkin had been commissioned by the Stratford Shakespeare Festival to write an adaptation of Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;. In 2010, Sorkin reportedly obtained the film rights to Andrew Young&#x27;s book &quot;The Politician&quot; (about Senator John Edwards), and announced that he would make his debut as a film director while adapting the book for the screen.

In November 2010, it was reported that Sorkin would write a musical based on the life of Houdini, with music by Danny Elfman. In January 2012, Stephen Schwartz was reported to be writing the music and lyrics, with Sorkin making his debut as a librettist. The musical was expected for release in 2013–14; Sorkin said: &quot;The chance to collaborate with Stephen Schwartz [the director], Jack O&#x27;Brien, and Hugh Jackman on a new Broadway musical is a huge gift.&quot; In January 2013, he quit the project, citing film and television commitments.

In March 2016, it was announced that Sorkin would adapt &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; for a live production on NBC, originally slated to air in 2017; , &quot;Sorkin is still mulling the project&quot;.

==Writing process and style==
Sorkin has written for the theater, film, and television, and in each medium his level of collaboration with other creators has varied. He began in theater, which involved a largely solitary writing process, then moved into film, where he collaborated with director Rob Reiner and screenwriter William Goldman, and eventually worked in television, where he collaborated very closely with director Thomas Schlamme for nearly a decade on the shows &quot;Sports Night&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot; and &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;; he now moves between all three media. He had a habit of chain smoking while he spent long hours plotting out scripts in his office, though he quit smoking after having a stroke in 2022. He describes his writing process as physical because he will often stand up and speak the dialogue he is developing. 

A &quot;New York Times&quot; article by Peter de Jonge explained that &quot;&quot;The West Wing&quot; is never plotted out for more than a few weeks ahead and has no major story lines&quot;, which De Jonge believed was because &quot;with characters who have no flaws, it is impossible to give them significant arcs&quot;. Sorkin has stated: &quot;I seldom plan ahead, not because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good to plan ahead, there just isn&#x27;t time.&quot; Sorkin has also said, &quot;As a writer, I don&#x27;t like to answer questions until the very moment that I have to.&quot; The &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; TV critic John Levesque has commented that Sorkin&#x27;s writing process &quot;can make for ill-advised plot developments&quot;. Further complicating the matter, in television, Sorkin will have a hand in writing every episode, rarely letting other writers earn full credit on a script. De Jonge reported that ex-writers of &quot;The West Wing&quot; have claimed that &quot;even by the spotlight-hogging standards of Hollywood, Sorkin has been exceptionally ungenerous in his sharing of writing credit&quot;. In a comment to &quot;GQ&quot; magazine in 2008, Sorkin said, &quot;I&#x27;m helped by a staff of people who have great ideas, but the scripts aren&#x27;t written by committee.&quot;

Sorkin&#x27;s long-term collaboration with Schlamme began in early 1998 when they found they shared common creative ground on the soon to be produced &quot;Sports Night&quot;. Their successful partnership in television is one in which Sorkin focuses on writing the scripts while Schlamme executive produces and occasionally directs; they have worked together on &quot;Sports Night&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot;, and &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;. Schlamme will create the look of the shows, work with the other directors, discuss the scripts with Sorkin as soon as they are turned in, make design and casting decisions, and attend the budget meetings; Sorkin tends to stick strictly to writing. In response to what he perceived as unfair criticism of &quot;The Newsroom&quot;, Jacob Drum of &quot;Digital Americana&quot; wrote, &quot;The essential truth that the critics miss is that &quot;The Newsroom&quot; is Sorkin being Sorkin as he always has been and always will be: one part pioneer; one part self-conscious romantic; two parts actual Lewis &amp; Clark-style pioneer, trapping his way across an old, old idea of an America that can always stand to raise its game—but most importantly, spinning a good yarn while he does so.&quot;

As a writer, Sorkin is recognized for his trademark fast-paced dialogue and extended monologues, complemented by frequent collaborator Thomas Schlamme&#x27;s storytelling technique called the &quot;walk and talk&quot;. These sequences consist of single tracking shots of long duration involving multiple characters engaging in conversation as they move through the set; characters enter and exit the conversation as the shot continues without any cuts. Sorkin is also known for writing memorable lines, such as &quot;You can&#x27;t handle the truth!&quot; from &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; and the partly Latin tirade against God: &quot;You get Hoynes!&quot; in &quot;The West Wing&quot; episode &quot;Two Cathedrals&quot;. For television, one hallmark of Sorkin&#x27;s writer&#x27;s voice is the repartee that his characters engage in as they small talk and banter about whimsical events taking place within an episode, and interject obscure popular culture references into conversation. Although his scripts are lauded for being literate, Sorkin has been criticized for often turning in scripts that are overwrought. His mentor William Goldman has commented that normally in visual media speeches are avoided, but that Sorkin has a talent for dialogue and gets away with breaking this rule. His portrayal of women has been criticized by several commentators, with female characters in his works often subordinate, written to support the main male characters, ditzy and incompetent or ostensibly professional while still being depicted as overly emotional and needing to be rescued by men.

==Personal life==

Sorkin married Julia Bingham in 1996 and divorced in 2005, with his workaholic habits and drug abuse reported to be a partial cause. Sorkin and Bingham have one daughter, Roxy. He dated Kristin Chenoweth, who played Annabeth Schott on &quot;The West Wing&quot;, for several years (after Sorkin had left the show). He has also reportedly dated columnist Maureen Dowd and actress Kristin Davis. In 2021, Sorkin and Paulina Porizkova dated for a few months.

A consistent supporter of the Democratic Party, Sorkin has made substantial political campaign contributions to candidates between 1999 and 2011, according to CampaignMoney.com. During the 2004 US presidential election campaign, the liberal advocacy group MoveOn&#x27;s political action committee enlisted Sorkin and Rob Reiner to create one of their anti-Bush campaign advertisements. In August 2008, Sorkin was involved in a Generation Obama event at the Fine Arts Theater in Beverly Hills, California, participating in a panel discussion subsequent to a screening of Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;. However, Sorkin does not consider himself a political activist: &quot;I&#x27;ve met political activists, and they&#x27;re for real. I&#x27;ve never marched anyplace or done anything that takes more effort than writing a check in terms of activism&quot;. In 2016, after President Donald Trump won the election, Sorkin wrote an open letter to his daughter Roxy and her mother Julia.

In 1987, Sorkin started using marijuana and cocaine. He said cocaine gave him relief from certain nervous tensions that occur on a regular basis. In 1995, he sought rehabilitation at the Hazelden Institute in Minnesota, on the advice of Bingham to combat his addiction. In early 2001, Sorkin and his colleagues John Spencer and Martin Sheen received the Phoenix Rising Award for overcoming their drug abuse. However, on April 15, 2001, Sorkin was arrested when security guards at Hollywood Burbank Airport found that he was in possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, crack cocaine, and a metal crack pipe. He was court-ordered to a drug diversion program, while still working on &quot;The West Wing&quot;. In a commencement speech for Syracuse University on May 13, 2012, Sorkin said he has not used cocaine for eleven years.

In November 2022, Sorkin had a stroke which was caused by hypertension. He later called it &quot;a loud wake-up call&quot; to improve his health, and said he quit smoking, changed his diet, and began exercising daily as a result.

In August 2014, he signed an open letter from members of the Hollywood community condemning Hamas rocket attacks on Israel during the 2014 Gaza War. In October 2023, he was one of many Hollywood signatories of a letter calling on President Biden to work toward the release of all Israeli hostages after the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel.

In October 2023, Sorkin dropped CAA over a post critical of Israel made by its co-chief of the motion pictures department, Maha Dakhil, during the Israel–Hamas war.

<text>Victor Burgin (born 1941) is a British artist and writer.

==Early life and education==

Burgin was born in Sheffield in England. He studied art at the Royal College of Art, in London, from 1962 to 1965 (A.R.C.A., 1st Class, 1965) before going to the United States to study at Yale University (M.F.A. 1967).

==Work==

Burgin first came to attention as a conceptual artist in the late 1960s and at that time was most noted for being a political photographer of the left, who would fuse photographs and words in the same picture. He has worked with photography and film, calling painting &quot;the anachronistic daubing of woven fabrics with coloured mud&quot;. His work is influenced by a variety of theorists and philosophers, most especially thinkers such as Sigmund Freud, Henri Lefebvre, André Breton, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Michel Foucault and Roland Barthes. (European Graduate School Staff Page)

==Academic career==

Burgin taught at Trent Polytechnic from 1967 to 1973 and at the School of Communication, Polytechnic of Central London from 1973 to 1988. From 1988 to 2001 Burgin lived and worked in San Francisco. He taught in the History of Consciousness program at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where he became Professor Emeritus of History of Consciousness. In 2000 he was Robert Gwathmey Chair in Art and Architecture, The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York. From 2001 to 2006 he was Millard Professor of Fine Art at Goldsmiths College, University of London. He is currently Professor of Visual Studies, Winchester School of Art, University of Southampton.

==Honours and awards==

In 1986, Burgin was nominated for the Turner Prize for his exhibitions at the Institute of Contemporary Arts and Kettle&#x27;s Yard Gallery in Cambridge and for a collection of his theoretical writings (&quot;The End of Art Theory&quot;) and a monograph of his visual work (&quot;Between&quot;). In 2005 he received an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Sheffield Hallam University (Hon. DUniv). In 2010 he received a &quot;Doctorat Honoris Causa&quot; from the Université de Liège.

<doc id="206457" wikidata="Q5260617" url="?curid=206457" title="Dependency (project management)">
<text>In a project network, a dependency is a link among a project&#x27;s terminal elements.

The A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide) does not define the term dependency, but refers for this term to a logical relationship, which in turn is defined as &quot;dependency between two activities, or between an activity and a milestone&quot;.

== Standard types of dependencies ==

There are four standard types of dependencies:
# Finish to start (FS)
#* &quot;A&quot; FS &quot;B&quot; means &quot;activity A must finish before activity B can begin&quot; (or &quot;B can&#x27;t start until A has finished&quot;).
#* &quot;(Foundations dug) FS (Concrete poured)&quot;
# Finish to finish (FF)
#* &quot;A&quot; FF &quot;B&quot; means &quot;activity A must finish before activity B can finish&quot; (or &quot;B can&#x27;t finish before A is finished&quot;) . 
#* &quot;(Last chapter written) FF (Entire book written)&quot;
# Start to start (SS).
#* &quot;A&quot; SS &quot;B&quot; means &quot;activity A must start before activity B can start&quot; (or &quot;B can&#x27;t start until A has started&quot;).
#* &quot;(Project work started) SS (Project management activities started)&quot;
# Start to finish (SF)
#* &quot;A&quot; SF &quot;B&quot; means &quot;activity A must start before activity B finishes&quot; (or &quot;B can&#x27;t finish until A has started&quot;)
#* &quot;(New shift started) SF (Previous shift finished)&quot;

Finish-to-start is considered a &quot;natural dependency&quot;. The Practice Standard for Scheduling recommends, that &quot;Typically, each predecessor activity would finish prior to the start of its successor activity (or activities)(known as finish-to-start (FS) relationship). Sometimes it is necessarily to overlap activities; an option may be selected to use start-to-start (SS), finish-to-finish (FF) or start-to-finish (SF) relationships...Whenever possible, the FS logical relationship should be used. If other types of relationships are used, they shall be used sparingly and with full understanding of how the relationships have been implemented in the scheduling software being used. Ideally, the sequence of all activities will be defined in such a way that the start of every activity has a logical relationship from a predecessor and the finish of every activity has a logical relationship to a successor&quot;.

SF is rarely used, and should generally be avoided. Microsoft recommends to use SF dependency for just-in-time scheduling. It can be easily shown however, that this would only work if resource levelling is not used, because resource levelling can delay a successor activity (an activity, which shall be finished just-in-time) in such a way, that it will finish later than the start of its logical predecessor activity, thus not fulfilling the just-in-time requirement.

There are three kinds of dependencies with respect to the reason for the existence of dependency:
# Causal (logical)
#* &quot;It is impossible to edit a text before it is written&quot;
#* &quot;It is illogical to pour concrete before you dig the foundations of a building&quot;
# Resource constraints
#* &quot;It is logically possible to paint four walls in a room simultaneously but there is only one painter&quot;
# Discretionary (preferential)
#* &quot;I want to paint the living room before painting the dining room, although I could do it the other way round, too&quot;

Early critical path-derived schedules often reflected only on causal (logical) or discretionary (preferential) dependencies because the assumption was that resources would be available or could be made available. Since at least the mid-1980s, competent project managers and schedulers have recognized that schedules must be based on resource availability. The critical chain method necessitates taking into account resource constraint-derived dependencies as well.

=== Leads and lags ===
Dependencies can be modified by leads, and lags. Both leads and lags can be applied to all 4 types of dependencies.

PMBOK defines lag as &quot;the amount of time whereby a successor activity will be delayed with respect to a predecessor activity&quot;.
For example:
When building two walls from a novel design, one might start the second wall 2 days after the first so that the second team can learn from the first. This is an example of a &quot;lag&quot; in a Start-Start relationship.

In accordance to PMBOK a lead is &quot;the amount of time whereby a successor activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor activity For example, on a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping could be scheduled to start prior to the scheduled punch list completion. This would be shown as a finish-to-start with two-week lead&quot;.

==Example==
If you are building a building, you can&#x27;t paint the walls before installing the water pipes into the walls.

== Advanced cases of activities dependencies ==
=== Maximal-type relationships ===
Activity A and Activity B are said to have a Maximal-Type Relationship, if Activity B can start after Activity A, but with the delay of no more than X. Real life examples, which are simulated by Maximal-Type Relation:
* Shoring of the trench has to be done not necessarily immediately after excavation, but within certain time, otherwise the trench will collapse.
* Vaccination of baby has to be done not immediately after birth, but within certain time
* Renewal of the passport has to be done some time after the current one has been issued, but before it expires.
* Invoice payment does not have to be done immediately, but within certain time after it has been issued.

Maximal-type relationships are rarely implemented in the project management software, most probably because with this feature it is too easy to create contradictory dependencies.

<text>The Hochtaunuskreis is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the middle of Hesse, Germany and is part of the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region. Neighbouring districts are Lahn-Dill, Wetteraukreis, district-free Frankfurt, Main-Taunus-Kreis, Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis, Limburg-Weilburg.

The Hochtaunuskreis and the Landkreis Starnberg regularly compete for the title of the wealthiest district in Germany.

==History==
The district was created in 1972 when the previous districts Obertaunus and Usingen were merged.

==Geography==
Geographically it covers the Taunus mountains. The highest elevation of the Taunus, the 881 meter high Großer Feldberg, is in the district. Lowest elevation of the district with 130m is the village &quot;Ober Erlenbach&quot;. The wealthy towns in the district&#x27;s densely populated southern part belong to the Frankfurt urban area.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms is a dimidiation of the arms of the Obertaunus district in the left half and the Usingen district in the right half. It shows a lion, the left half in the red-white striped style of the Hesse lion, the right side the golden color lion of Nassau. Additionally in the left four bells which were taken from the counts of Kronberg, and in the right four trefoils from the coat of arms of the city of Usingen.

<text>A moonbow (also known as a moon rainbow or lunar rainbow) is a rainbow produced by moonlight rather than direct sunlight. Other than the difference in the light source, its formation is the same as for a solar rainbow: It is caused by the refraction of light in many water droplets, such as a rain shower or a waterfall, and is always positioned in the opposite part of the sky from the Moon relative to the observer.

Moonbows are much fainter than solar rainbows, due to the smaller amount of light reflected from the surface of the Moon. Because the light is usually too faint to excite the cone color receptors in human eyes, it is difficult for the human eye to discern colors in a moonbow. As a result, a moonbow often appears to be white. However, the colors in a moonbow do appear in long exposure photographs.
Moonbows have been mentioned at least since Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Meteorology&quot; (circa 350 BC).

==Viewing==

Moonbows are most easily viewed when the Moon is at or nearest to its brightest phase full moon. For moonbows to have the greatest prospect of appearing, the Moon must be low in the sky (at an elevation of less than 42 degrees, preferably lower) and must not be obscured by cloud. In addition, the night sky must be very dark. Since the sky is not completely dark on a rising/setting full moon, this means they can only be observed two to three hours before sunrise (a time with few observers), or two to three hours after sunset. And, of course, there must be water droplets (e.g. from rain or spray) opposite the Moon. This combination of requirements makes moonbows much rarer than rainbows produced by the daytime sunlight. Moonbows may also be visible when rain falls during full moonrise at extreme latitudes during the winter months when the prevalence of the hours of darkness gives more opportunity for the phenomenon to be observed.

It is said that the definition of the colours depends upon the size of the moisture drops present in the air: the smaller they are the less vivid the colours. Below 1/500 inch diameter they usually refract more or less white light as the component colours are merged. 
===Locations===

Numerous places in the world feature spray-, fog- or mist-induced bows. In the United States such bows may be seen in relation to various waterfalls including Niagara Falls, New York, Yosemite National Park, California and Cumberland Falls, near Corbin, Kentucky. Victoria Falls, on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe is also widely known for spray moonbows. 

Spray moonbows are also seen with some regularity in the cloud forests of Costa Rica, in mountain towns like Monteverde and Santa Elena. These occur when clouds of mist are blown in from the Caribbean by the Christmas Winds. The Christmas Winds happen from the end of December through late January or early February. These clouds of mists create a streaming pattern of stripes giving rise to their popular name in Spanish, &quot;pelo de gato&quot; (&quot;cat&#x27;s hair). Moonbows happen in this part of Costa Rica almost every full moon in the months of December through February. The bows that are caused by Pelo de Gato are not limited to just before dawn but can happen after sunset too, but it does need a full or nearly full moon.

Moonbows are also found in wet regions of Hawaii, such as Kauai (with the moon rising in the east during light rain) and the Big Island of Hawaii.

<doc id="206465" wikidata="Q654371" url="?curid=206465" title="All the World's a Stage (album)">
<text>All the World&#x27;s a Stage is a double live album by Canadian rock band Rush, released in September 1976 by Mercury Records. The album was recorded at Massey Hall in Toronto on June 11–13, 1976, during the band&#x27;s breakthrough &quot;2112&quot; tour. The title of the album alludes to William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;As You Like It&quot;, and would again be referenced by Rush in the 1981 song &quot;Limelight&quot;.

==Content==
According to lead vocalist and bassist Geddy Lee, the release of a live album in late 1976 &quot;was definitely something we used to buy us more time&quot; as Rush worked on the studio follow-up to their commercial breakthrough album &quot;2112&quot;, released earlier that same year.

This album captures the entire setlist that was regularly performed during headlining shows of the 2112 tour. However, due to technological limits of approximately 20 minutes per side on vinyl, the positions of &quot;Lakeside Park&quot; and &quot;2112&quot; were swapped with &quot;Fly By Night / In The Mood&quot; and &quot;Something For Nothing&quot;.

Due to stage time constraints during the 2112 tour of 1976, this performance of the song &quot;2112&quot; omits the &quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Oracle: The Dream&quot; sections of the studio recording. Although the final 32 seconds of &quot;Discovery&quot; are played as a lead-in to &quot;Presentation&quot;, the liner notes and track listing do not indicate this. While the entirety of &quot;Discovery&quot; would be performed during the A Farewell To Kings tour of 1977-78 and Hemispheres tour of 1978–79, Rush would not perform the entire suite live until the Test for Echo tour of 1996–97, as documented on the live album &quot;Different Stages&quot;.

Alternate recordings of &quot;2112&quot; and &quot;Something For Nothing&quot; from the June 11–13 performances were released as part of the &quot;2112: 40th Anniversary&quot; box set in 2016.

According to the liner notes, &quot;All the World&#x27;s a Stage&quot; marks the end of the &quot;first chapter of Rush&quot; and would begin a trend of Rush releasing a live album after every four studio albums. This lasted until 2003, when the band released a live album and DVD of each subsequent studio album&#x27;s tour.

Fellow Toronto band Max Webster was the opening act for all 3 Massey Hall performances recorded for the album.

==Reception==
&quot;All the World&#x27;s a Stage&quot; was Rush&#x27;s first US Top 40-charting album and went gold, alongside &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; and &quot;2112&quot; on November 16, 1977. It was certified platinum in the United States in 1981 after the release of &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;. In Canada, Gold certification came on December 1, 1976, and platinum on August 1, 1978.

==Reissues==
A remaster was issued in 1997.
* The tray has a picture of the star with man painting (mirroring the cover art of &quot;Retrospective I&quot;) with &quot;The Rush Remasters&quot; printed in all capital letters just to the left. All remasters from &quot;Rush&quot; through &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; are like this.
* The original CD omitted &quot;What You&#x27;re Doing&quot; and the post-show chatter due to recording length constraints (CDs could hold only 75 minutes at the time). By 1997, however, advances in recording technology had increased that maximum time to 80 minutes; the missing song and chatter are included in the remaster. Prior to its release, the same live version of &quot;What You&#x27;re Doing&quot; was included on the compilation &quot;Chronicles&quot; in 1990.
* The album&#x27;s original triple gatefold artwork with concert pictures is included with the remaster.

&quot;All the World&#x27;s a Stage&quot; was remastered again in 2011 by Andy VanDette for the &quot;Sector&quot; box sets, which re-released all of Rush&#x27;s Mercury-era albums. &quot;All the World&#x27;s a Stage&quot; is included in the &quot;Sector 1&quot; set.

&quot;All the World&#x27;s a Stage&quot; was remastered for vinyl in 2015 by Sean Magee at Abbey Road Studios as a part of the official &quot;12 Months of Rush&quot; promotion. The high definition master prepared for this release was also made available for purchase in 24-bit/96 kHz and 24-bit/192 kHz formats, at several high-resolution audio online music stores. These masters have significantly less dynamic range compression than the 1997 remasters and the &quot;Sector&quot; remasters by Andy VanDette.

<doc id="206466" wikidata="Q1374608" url="?curid=206466" title="F. J. A. Hort">
<text>Fenton John Anthony Hort (23 April 1828 – 30 November 1892), known as F. J. A. Hort, was an Irish-born theologian and editor, with Brooke Foss Westcott of a critical edition of &quot;The New Testament in the Original Greek&quot;.

==Life==
He was born on 23 April 1828 in Dublin, the great-grandson of Josiah Hort, Archbishop of Tuam in the eighteenth century. In 1846 he passed from Rugby School to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was the contemporary of E. W. Benson, B. F. Westcott and J. B. Lightfoot. The four men became lifelong friends and fellow workers. In 1850 Hort took his degree, being third in the classical &quot;tripos&quot;. In 1851 he also took the recently established triposes in moral science and natural science, and in 1852 he became fellow of his college. In 1854, in conjunction with John E. B. Mayor and Lightfoot, he established the &quot;Journal of Classical and Sacred Philology&quot;, and plunged eagerly into theological and patristic study. He had been brought up in the strictest principles of the evangelical movement, but at Rugby, under the influence of Thomas Arnold and Archibald Campbell Tait, and through his acquaintance with F. D. Maurice and Charles Kingsley, he finally moved towards liberalism.

In 1857 he was married, and accepted the college living of St Ippolyts, near Hitchin, in Hertfordshire, where he remained for fifteen years. During his time there he took part in discussions on university reform, continued his studies, and wrote essays for various periodicals. In 1870 he was appointed a member of the committee for revising the translation of the New Testament, and in 1871 he delivered the Hulsean Lectures before the university. Their title was &quot;The Way, the Truth, and the Life&quot;, but they were not prepared for publication until many years after their delivery. In 1872 he accepted a fellowship and lectureship at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. In 1873 he became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. In 1878 he was made Hulsean Professor of Divinity and in 1887 Lady Margaret&#x27;s Professor of Divinity.

Hort died on 30 November 1892 in Cambridge. He is buried in the Mill Road Cemetery, Cambridge.

==Works==

In 1881 he published, with his friend Westcott, an edition of the text of the New Testament based on their text critical work. The Revision Committee had largely accepted this text, even before its publication, as a basis for their translation of the New Testament. Its appearance created a sensation among scholars, and it was attacked in many quarters, but on the whole, it was received as being much the nearest approximation yet made to the original text of the New Testament. The introduction was the work of Hort. His first principle was, &quot;Knowledge of Documents should precede Final Judgments upon Readings&quot;.

Next to his Greek Testament, his best-known work is &quot;The Christian Ecclesia&quot; (1897). Other publications are: &quot;Judaistic Christianity&quot; (1894); &quot;Village Sermons&quot; (two series); &quot;Cambridge and other Sermons&quot;; &quot;Prolegomena to ... Romans and Ephesians&quot; (1895); &quot;The Ante-Nicene Fathers&quot; (1895); and two &quot;Dissertations&quot;, (1876) on the reading of a Greek word in John i.18, and on &quot;The Constantinopolitan and other Eastern Creeds in the Fourth Century.&quot; All are models of exact scholarship and skilful use of materials. His &quot;Life and Letters&quot; was edited by his son, Sir Arthur Hort, Bart, in two volumes published in 1896: &quot;Volume 1&quot;, &quot;Volume 2&quot;.

==Other==
Hort was a member of the Cambridge Apostles and is credited with writing the oath of secrecy taken by new members, in or around 1851.

<text>, better known in Japan as , was an English navigator who, in 1600, became the first Englishman to reach Japan. He was later granted samurai status, and was recognized as one of the most influential foreigners in Japan during the early 17th century.

He arrived in Japan as one of the few survivors of the ship &quot;&quot; under the leadership of Jacob Quaeckernaeck. It was the only vessel to reach Japan from a five-ship expedition launched by a company of Rotterdam merchants (a &quot;voorcompagnie&quot;, or predecessor, of the Dutch East India Company). Soon after his arrival in Japan, Adams and his second mate Jan Joosten became advisors to &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ieyasu, and each was appointed as &quot;hatamoto&quot;.

For more than a decade, the Tokugawa authorities did not allow Adams and Joosten to leave Japan. Although eventually given permission to return home to England, Adams decided to stay in Japan, where he died at the age of 55. His Japan-born children, Joseph and Susanna, were likely expelled to Batavia in 1635 when Tokugawa Iemitsu closed Japan to foreign trade; they disappear from historical records at that time.

==Early life==
Adams was born in Gillingham, Kent, England. His father died when he was twelve, and he was apprenticed to shipyard owner Master Nicholas Diggins at Limehouse for the seafaring life. He spent the next twelve years learning shipbuilding, astronomy, and navigation before entering the Royal Navy.

With England at war with Spain, Adams served in the Royal Navy under Sir Francis Drake. He saw naval service against the Spanish Armada in 1588 as master of the &quot;Richarde Dyffylde&quot;, a resupply ship carrying ammunition and food for the English fleet. Adams became a pilot for the Barbary Company. During this service, Jesuit sources claim he took part in an expedition to the Arctic that lasted about two years, in search of a Northeast Passage along the coast of Siberia to the Far East.

Adams&#x27; fleet consisted of:
* &quot;Hoop&quot; (&quot;Hope&quot;), led by Admiral Jacques Mahu (d. 1598), who was succeeded by Simon de Cordes (d. 1599) and Simon de Cordes Jr; this ship was lost near the Hawaiian Islands;
* &quot;Liefde&quot; (&quot;Love&quot; or &quot;Charity&quot;), led by Simon de Cordes, second in command, succeeded by Gerrit van Beuningen, and finally under Jacob Quaeckernaeck; this was the only ship to reach Japan;
* &quot;Geloof&quot; (&quot;Faith&quot;), led by Gerrit van Beuningen and in the end, Sebald de Weert; this was the only ship that returned to Rotterdam;
* &quot;Trouw&quot; (&quot;Loyalty&quot;), led by Jurriaan van Boekhout (d. 1599) and finally, Baltazar de Cordes; this ship was captured in Tidore;
* &quot;Blijde Boodschap&quot; (&quot;Good Tiding&quot; or &quot;The Gospel&quot;), led by Sebald de Weert, and later, Dirck Gerritz, was seized in Valparaiso.

Jacques Mahu and Simon de Cordes were the leaders of an expedition with the goal to reach Chile, Peru and other kingdoms in New Spain such as Nueva Galicia, the Captaincy General of Guatemala, Nueva Vizcaya the New Kingdom of León and Santa Fe de Nuevo México. The fleet&#x27;s original mission was to go to South America&#x27;s western coast and trade their cargo for silver, then head to Japan only if the original mission failed. The crews were supposed to obtain silver in Japan and spices in Moluccas before returning home. Their goal was to sail through the Strait of Magellan to get to their destination, which scared many sailors because of the harsh weather conditions.

The first major expedition around South America was organized by a &quot;voorcompagnie&quot;, the Rotterdam or Magelhaen Company. It organized two fleets of five and four ships with 750 sailors and soldiers, including 30 English musicians.

After leaving Goeree on 27 June 1598, the ships sailed to the Channel but anchored in the Downs until mid July. When the ships approached the shores of North Africa, Simon de Cordes realized his rations had been far too generous in the early weeks of the voyage and instituted a &#x27;bread policy&#x27;. At the end of August, the ships landed at Santiago, Cape Verde and Mayo off the coast of Africa because of a lack of water and need for fresh fruit. They stayed around three weeks in the hope of buying some goats. Near Praia, the expedition succeeded in occupying a Portuguese castle on the top of a hill but came back without anything substantial. At Brava, Cape Verde, half of the crew of the &quot;Hoop&quot; caught fever and most of the men were sick, among them Admiral Jacques Mahu. After his death, leadership of the expedition was taken over by Simon de Cordes, with Van Beuningen as vice admiral. Because of contrary wind, the fleet was blown off course (northeast in the opposite direction) and arrived at Cape Lopez, Gabon, Central Africa. An outbreak of scurvy forced a landing on Annobón on 9 December. Several men became sick with dysentery. They stormed the island only to find that the Portuguese and their native allies had set fire to their houses and fled into the hills. The Dutch put all their sick men ashore to recover and left in early January. Because of starvation, the men fell into great weakness; some tried to eat leather. On 10 March 1599 they reached the Rio de la Plata in what is now Argentina.

By early April, the crew arrived at the Strait, 570 km long, 2 km wide at its narrowest point, with an inaccurate chart of the seabed. The wind was unfavorable and remained so for the next four months. Under freezing temperatures and poor visibility, they caught penguins, seals, mussels, duck and fish. About two hundred crew members died. On 23 August, the weather improved.

=== Voyage to Pacific ===


When the expedition finally reached the Pacific Ocean on 3 September 1599, the ships were caught in a storm and lost sight of each other. The &quot;Trouw&quot; and the &quot;Geloof&quot; were driven back into the strait. After more than a year, each ship went its own way.
The &quot;Geloof&quot; returned to Rotterdam in July 1600 with 36 survivors of the original 109 crew.

De Cordes ordered his small fleet to wait four weeks for each other on Santa María Island, Chile, but some ships missed the island. Adams wrote &quot;they brought us sheep and potatoes&quot;. From here the story becomes less reliable because of a lack of sources and changes in command. In early November, the &quot;Hoop&quot; arrived at Mocha Island where 27 people, including Simon de Cordes, were killed by people from Araucania. (In the account given to Olivier van Noort, it was said that Simon de Cordes was slain at the Punta de Lavapie, but Adams gives Mocha Island as the scene of his death.) The &quot;Liefde&quot; hit the island, but went on to Punta Lavapié near Concepción, Chile. A Spanish captain supplied the &quot;Trouw&quot; and &quot;Hoop&quot; with food; the Dutch helped him against the Araucans, who had killed 23 Dutch, including Thomas Adams (according to his brother in his second letter) and Gerrit van Beuningen. He was replaced by Jacob Quaeckernaeck.

The &quot;Trouw&quot; reached Tidore (Eastern Indonesia), where the crew were killed by the Portuguese in January 1601. In fear of the hostile Spaniards, the remaining crews determined to leave Floreana Island and sail across the Pacific. On 27 November 1599, when both ships sailed to Japan, the fleet was stranded on an isle which is believed to have been Hawaii.

===Arrival in Japan===

On 19 April 1600, the nine surviving crew members arrived at Bungo (modern day Usuki, Ōita, Ōita Prefecture), controlled by Ōtomo Yoshimune, where they met with local people. The former &quot;daimyo&quot; of the region made the initial decision to look after Adams&#x27;s crew so that they could be questioned by the Council of Five Elders. The crew spent their first five days in Japan in comfortable accommodations, but Portuguese Jesuit missionary priests arrived to serve as interpreters, claiming that Adams&#x27;s ship was a pirate vessel and that the crew should be executed as pirates. Thereafter, Ota Shigemasa, the lord of Usuki Castle, decided to seize the ship and imprison the crew in a filthy prison. After nine days in Japan, Adams and Jan Joosten were sent to Osaka Castle by the orders of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the &quot;daimyo&quot; of Edo. They arrived in Osaka on May 12, where Adams met Ieyasu in Osaka three times between May and June. In a letter to his wife, Adams refers to Ieyasu as a king of Japan. Adams writes that Ieyasu had taken an interest in him, that there are Portuguese speaking people in the court of Ieyasu, and that Ieyasu is interested in trading with the East India Company. Adams also reports that Ieyasu asked him which countries were enemies of England, and he responded that England was at war with Portugal and Spain. Finally, Adams writes that Ieyasu had rejected the Jesuits&#x27; request that Ieyasu execute him; their conversation continued until midnight.

== Service under Tokugawa shogunate ==

In August 1600, Ieyasu, through his envoy Suminokura, offered to free Adams and his crew in exchange for support in the upcoming civil war. Adams and Joosten were released from Osaka Castle after six weeks and were sent back to their ship. Ieyasu ordered the crew to sail the &quot;Liefde&quot; from Bungo to Edo, and the ship arrived at Uraga. Adams thereafter lodged with Honda Masazumi in Edo, while his crew resided with Mukai Shogen in Uraga. In Edo, Adams trained Tokugawa&#x27;s army in firing the cannon that had been removed from the ship. In late August, Adams joined Tokugawa&#x27;s army in a battle in Aizu, and in October he again joined the army in its march westward, culminating in the decisive Battle of Sekigahara that effectively secured Ieyasu&#x27;s control over Japan. Following the victory at Sekigahara, Ieyasu awarded Adams 10,000 Portuguese reals, although he did not allow the &quot;Liefde&quot; crew to leave Japan.

=== Service under Ieyasu ===
In 1601, Ieyasu gave each crew member a regular rice allowance in exchange for serving as teachers and advisors to the shogunate.

In the autumn of 1603, Adams successfully piloted the first Spanish merchant ship into Edo Bay, after which Edo became a trading port. In May 1603, Ieyasu further granted Adams a mansion in Edo with housekeepers, a monthly allowance of 50 &quot;Ryō&quot;, and a daily allowance of a kilogram of rice, as well as an expanded allowance for his crew members.

In 1604, he built the first shipbuilding dock in Japan in Ito.

In 1605, Ieyasu further granted Adams the status of samurai and the name &quot;Miura Anjin&quot;. Ieyasu also appointed him as &quot;jikatatori hatamoto&quot;, or a direct vassal in the court of the &quot;shōgun&quot;. In the same year, Adams secured an authorization letter from Ieyasu to invite the Dutch East India Company to trade with Japan. At this time, Adams also attempted to send letters to his family and friends in England through the Dutch, but Quaeckerneck and Santvoort did not deliver the letters in order to avoid making Adams&#x27;s fate known to the English East India Company, which was becoming a trading rival to the Dutch.

In 1607, in response to Adams&#x27;s achievements, Ieyasu selected him for the high-prestige position of direct retainer in the &quot;shōgun&quot;&#x27;s court, entrusting him with territories and swords from Miura-gun (now a part of Yokosuka City). After Tokugawa Hidetada was installed as the second &quot;shōgun&quot; and Ieyasu became &quot;Ōgosho&quot; (retired &quot;shōgun&quot;), they formed a dual government: Hidetada controlled the official court with the government central located in Edo city, and Ieyasu controlled his own informal shadow body called the &quot;Sunpu government&quot; with its center at Sunpu Castle. The Sunpu government&#x27;s cabinet consisted of trusted vassals of Ieyasu who were not in Hidetada&#x27;s cabinet, including Adams and Lodensteijn, to whom Ieyasu entrusted foreign affairs and diplomacy. Adams also received generous revenues from his service under Ieyasu and was granted a domain in Hemi (:ja:逸見) within the frontier of present-day Yokosuka City, with nearly a hundred slaves and servants. Also in 1607, Ieyasu gave order to Adams and his companions to assist Mukai Shōgen, a chief commander of Uraga naval forces, to build the shogunate&#x27;s first Western-style vessel. The sailing ship was built at the harbor of Itō on the east coast of the Izu Peninsula. Carpenters from the harbor supplied the manpower to build an 80-ton ship, which would be used to patrol the coast of Japan. The following year, the &quot;shōgun&quot; ordered a larger ship of 120 tons to be built. According to Adams, Ieyasu was satisfied with his work.

Until 1609, the Dutch were not able to send ships to Japan due to conflicts with the Portuguese and limited resources in Asia.

=== Diplomacy with Europe and New Spain ===
On 2 July 1609, a pair of Dutch ships led by Jacques Specx, &quot;De Griffioen&quot; (&quot;the Griffin,&quot; armed with 19 cannons) and &quot;Roode Leeuw met Pijlen&quot; (&quot;Red Lion with Arrows,&quot; weighing 400 tons and armed with 26 cannons), reached Japan. The men of this Dutch expeditionary fleet established a trading base on Hirado Island. Two Dutch envoys, Puyck and van den Broek, were the official bearers of a letter from Prince Maurice of Nassau to the court of Edo. Adams negotiated and helped these Dutch emissaries to obtain trading rights throughout Japan as well as the right to establish a trading factory:

The Hollandes be now settled (in Japan) and I have got them that privilege as the Spaniards and Portingals could never get in this 50 or 60 years in Japan.

After obtaining permission from Tokugawa Ieyasu on 24 August, the Dutch erected their factory at Hirado, Nagasaki, on 20 September. In the same year, Ieyasu sent Adams to Onjuku, where the Spanish galleon &quot;San Francisco&quot; was wrecked while carrying the interim governor of the Philippines, Rodrigo de Vivero y Aberrucia. Adams managed to secure establish a friendly relationship between Japan and New Spain by exchanging letters with de Vivero.

In 1610, after the Nossa Senhora da Graça incident, Ieyasu replaced Jesuit translator João Rodrigues Tçuzu with William Adams as his counselor of affairs with the Europeans. In the same year, the 120-ton Japanese warship San Buena Ventura was lent to the Spanish. They sailed it to New Spain, accompanied by a mission of twenty-two Japanese representatives led by Tanaka Shōsuke. Following the construction, Ieyasu ordered Adams to visit his palace anytime he called.

In June 1611, The Spanish sent Sebastián Vizcaíno to Japan to negotiate terms for a shogunate-sponsored mining expedition in New Spain. Adams attempted to persuade Ieyasu and his successor Shogun Tokugawa Hidetada that the Spanish parlays were a precursor to a colonization attempt. In an effort to counter this, Adams arranged for a Dutch mining engineer to visit Japan in late 1611 to assist in developing the Toi gold mine in western Izu. Adams and Mukai Shogen oversaw the construction of the new ship for Vizcaíno&#x27;s expedition, &quot;San Sebastian&quot;, which sank shortly after being loaded and sailed off in October. In the same year, Adams learned of an English East India Company settlement in Old Banten of the Banten Sultanate (present-day Indonesia) and also became aware that the Dutch had not delivered his letters to England. He wrote a letter to the settlement to invite his family and friends in England to trade with Japan, suggesting that &quot;the Hollanders have here an Indies of money.&quot; Adams entrusted this 5,960-word letter to English sailor Thomas Hill, who had come to Hirado on a Dutch ship.

In January 1613, Hill delivered a reply to Adams from company representative Augustine Spalding. In June, John Saris, captain of the ship &quot;Clove&quot;, arrived at Hirado on a mission to establish a trading factory for the company. Adams traveled from Hemi to Hirado to meet Saris on July 27, the first meeting of Englishmen on Japanese soil. Adams traveled with Saris to Sumpu Castle in Suruga to meet Ieyasu and seek permission to return to England. They continued to Kamakura, where they visited Kamakura Great Buddha, and Edo, where they met the acting &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Hidetada. Hidetada gave them a set of Japanese armour as a gift for King James I. They returned to Sumpu on 29 September, where Ieyasu gave them a &quot;Red Seal&quot;, a license of permission for foreign tradings in Japan. The English party returned to Hirado on 6 November 1613. Instead of returning to England, Adams started his new job at Hirado trading factory on 24November, under contract with the East India Company for an annual salary of 100 pounds, more than double the regular salary of 40 pounds earned by the other workers at Hirado. During this time, Adams worked under Richard Cocks and six of his friends (Tempest Peacock, Richard Wickham, William Eaton, Walter Carwarden, Edmund Sayers and William Nealson). Adams advised the company to cancel their original plan to erect an English settlement in Hirado, which he deemed too small and too far from Osaka and Edo markets; Adams instead recommended selection of Uraga, near Edo, for a post. Saris, however, who distrusted Adams, wanted to keep an eye on Dutch activities.

In 1614, Father Diogo de Carvalho complained about the threat posed by Adams and other Protestant merchants in his annual report to Pope Paul V, stating that William Adams and his companions had influenced Ieyasu to be hostile to Catholics. Tokugawa Ieyasu, influenced by Adams&#x27;s anti-Catholic counsels and the increase in samurai and daimyos converting to Catholicism (as in the Okamoto Daihachi incident, for example), banished all Portuguese Jesuits from Japan in 1614. He also demanded that all Japanese Catholics abandon their new faith and launched what would become a centuries-long policy of religious persecution aimed at those who refused.

In the same year, Adams received permission from both Japan and England to return to England. Although Adams had intended to give up his status and property in Japan to make the voyage on the &quot;Clove&quot;, he changed his mind after returning to Hirado with Saris. Saris disliked Adams for his insistence on following Japanese customs, while Adams disliked Saris for his tendency to be impolite. After the &quot;Clove&quot; left, Adams helped out at the English trading post in Japan, although he was paid less than he had been working at the Dutch trading post. Richard Cocks, the head of the Hirado factory, praised Adams&#x27;s manners and his calm temperament, which Cocks described as similar to those of his Japanese hosts. In a letter to the East India Company, Cocks wrote that he found Adams to be easy to approach and confirmed his willingness to cooperate with Adams for the next seven years. On the eve of Siege of Osaka, Ieyasu prepared for the war effort by stockpiling ammunition. In May, a company of English merchants tried to sell lead in Hirado but failed to find a buyer until, with the help of Adams, the shogunate purchased their entire stock. In the same month, the shogunate bought lead from a Dutch trading company. Later in June, Adams acted as middleman while Tokugawa Ieyasu stockpiled cannons, gunpowder, and bullets purchased from English merchants. The prices agreed upon were 1 kan for cannons, 2.3 bun for gunpowder, and 1.6 bun for bullets. Later in the same year, Adams wanted to organize a trade expedition to Siam to bolster profits and help the company&#x27;s situation, so he bought and upgraded a 200-ton Japanese junk ship, renamed it &quot;Sea Adventure&quot;, and hired a crew: around 120 Japanese sailors and merchants, several Chinese traders, an Italian, a Spanish trader and Richard Wickham and Edmund Sayers of the English factory&#x27;s staff. The ship sailed from Hirado in November. The enterprise aimed to purchase raw silk, Chinese goods, Biancaea sappan, deer skins and ray skins for the hilts of katana swords.

On 27 January 1615, the ships under Adams&#x27;s command, carrying £1,250 in silver, £175 of Indian cottons, and a stock of Japanese weapons and lacquerware, encountered a storm near the Ryukyu Islands. They docked at Naha, but the Ryukyu ruler Shō Nei refused to help repair the ships, which prompted the crew to go on strike and forced the ship to give away its anchorage in February. In June, the fleet returned to Hirado after purchasing goods from Ryukyu islands, including sweet potatoes, which had initially been cultivated by the East India Company in Hirado and the seeds planted in Satsuma province. On 7 December, after a trip to Edo to meet with the ambassador from New Spain on Shogun Ieyasu&#x27;s orders, Adams left Hirado for Ayutthaya in Siam on the refitted &quot;Sea Adventure,&quot; intent on obtaining sappan wood for resale in Japan. In Bangkok, Adams met with the King of Siam and obtained a trading license for the English, then sailed the &quot;Sea Adventure&quot; to Japan with 143 tonnes of sappan wood and 3,700 deer skins, returning to Hirado within 47 days. (The return trip took from 5 June to 22 July 1616).

=== Service under Hidetada and Death ===
In 1616, less than a week before Adams&#x27;s return from Bangkok, Ieyasu died, giving his son &quot;shōgun&quot; Hidetada practical control over the country. Hidetada, less interested in foreign affairs than Ieyasu, barred Adams from his next audience with the company, in part due to distrust stemming from the conversion of Adams&#x27;s Japanese wife to Christianity. However, three weeks later, Hidetada met with Adams, and in September he agreed to maintain the English trading privileges and also issued a new Red Seal permit (&quot;shuinjō&quot;), which allowed Adams to continue trade activities overseas under the &quot;shōgun&quot;&#x27;s protection. While Hidetada confined English trading activities to Hirado and Nagasaki and barred Japanese merchants from purchasing goods from foreigners in Osaka and Kyoto, Adams retained his &quot;hatamoto&quot; status and was exempted from these restrictions. Later in December, Adams declined to join an English expedition from Hirado; there is evidence that he was suffering from a mental breakdown due to the death of Ieyasu and its political aftershocks, as well as physical injuries Adams sustained on the way back from Edo after meeting Hidetada.

In March 1617, Adams set sail to Cochinchina on a junk ship which he had purchased and brought from Siam and renamed &quot;Gift of God&quot;. He intended to find two English sailors, Tempest Peacock and Walter Carwarden. Once in Cochinchina, however, Adams learned that Peacock, a drunk, had committed murder. Adams killed Peacock and chased after Carwarden, who was waiting downstream with a boat. Realizing that Adams had killed his companion, Carwarden panicked, capsized his boat, and drowned. When Adams reached Osaka with his ship &quot;Gift of God&quot; in September 1617, he met with Hidetada at Fushimi Castle and obtained new Red Seal licenses. He agreed to sell both the ship and the licenses to the English factory in Hirado.

in 1618, on July, Adams joined a Dutch mission from Hirado to Edo. Shortly thereafter, the Dutch brought the captured English ship &quot;Attendance&quot; to Hirado, sparking hostilities between the previously friendly English and Dutch merchants there. Though Adams initially refused to help the English appeal to the &quot;shōgun&quot; about the issue, arguing that Hidetada would not be interested, he later changed his mind and met with Hidetada in October. Because Adams had sold his Red Seal license to the English, however, and because of the disturbances that occurred on the resulting voyage, Hidetada refused to grant further licenses to the factory. Adams returned to Hirado in December after spending months attempting to save the English factory.

From March until August 1619, Adams undertook a final voyage to Cochinchina and Tonkin, using a personal Red Seal license rather than working for the English. During this voyage, England and the Netherlands went to war in Asia, and Adams contracted a tropical disease which caused his health to deteriorate. After returning to Hirado, Adams managed to rescue three English prisoners who were imprisoned on a Dutch ship. In the final months of his life, Adams assisted the English factory by acting as a broker for trade with the governor of Nagasaki.

Adams died at Hirado, north of Nagasaki, on 16 May 1620, at the age of 55. In his will, he left his residence in Edo, his domain in Hemi (in Yokosuka&lt;ref name=&quot;JE/adams&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;), and 500 English pounds to be distributed evenly among his family in England and Japan. The English family&#x27;s portion of the inheritance did not reach London until 1622, after his wife Mary Hyn was already dead.

Cocks wrote: &quot;I cannot but be sorrowful for the loss of such a man as Capt William Adams, he having been in such favour with two Emperors of Japan as never any Christian in these part of the world.&quot; Cocks records that Hidetada transferred the lordship from William Adams to his son Joseph Adams with the attendant rights to the estate at Hemi.

Adams was buried in Hirado next to a memorial to Saint Francis Xavier. A few years later, many foreign cemeteries were destroyed and the Tokugawa shogunate began aggressively persecuting Christians.

== Personal life ==
During his stay in Japan, Adams developed a high esteem for Japanese society under the Tokugawa shogunate. He viewed the Japanese as courteous, valiant, impartial in justice, and civilly governed.

According to American author and literature expert Susan Wise Bauer, William Adams was a fervent Protestant who detested Catholics.

=== Family ===
Adams was recorded to have married Mary Hyn in the parish church of St Dunstan&#x27;s, Stepney, on 20 August 1589. They had two children together, a son John and a daughter Deliverance. After Adams&#x27;s voyage to Japan, Mary Hyn was forced to leave Limehouse and became destitute for some time, although she received a portion of Adams&#x27;s wages from the East India Company in 1615. Mary died in 1620 at Gillingham in Kent.

After settling in Japan, Adams married a Japanese woman, although there is no clear evidence of her name and background in either Japanese or European historical records. A common account is that his wife was named Oyuki () and was the adopted daughter of Magome Kageyu, an official who was responsible for a pack-horse exchange on one of the imperial roads that led out of Edo. Although Magome was important, Oyuki was not of noble birth or high social standing. The family link to Magome is shown in Japanese historical accounts written in the 1800s, while the first known reference to the name &quot;Oyuki&quot; is from a fictional work in 1973, and earlier fictional accounts refer to Adams&#x27;s wife by names such as Mary, Tsu, Bikuni, Tae, and Chrysanthemum.

Adams and his Japanese wife had a son Joseph and a daughter Susanna. Some accounts describe Adams having other children with concubines or mistresses, but no such children were named in his will. Richard Cocks wrote that Adams&#x27;s interpreter, &quot;Coshuro,&quot; claimed support for Adams&#x27;s son &quot;Cowjohns&quot; in 1621, after Adams&#x27;s death, and that he also made similar support payments for another alleged child of Adams.

By 1629, only two of Adams&#x27;s shipmates from 1600 survived in Japan: Melchior van Santvoort and Vincent Romeyn lived quietly in Nagasaki.

In 1635, Hidetada&#x27;s successor Tokugawa Iemitsu enforced the Sakoku Edict for Japan to be closed against foreign trading; both Joseph and Susanna disappear from historical records at that time. It is presumed that, like all Japanese of mixed race, they were expelled to the Dutch colony of Batavia (modern day Jakarta, Indonesia).

== Historical legacy and evaluations ==
It was rumored that Adams&#x27;s bones were taken for safekeeping by a family member or close friend and reburied at what is now the William Adams Memorial Park on Sakigata Hill, Hirado. In 1931, a grave marked as a Miura family tomb was excavated and skeletal remains discovered there were assumed to belong to Adams, but without DNA evidence this could not be confirmed with certainty. The remains were later placed in a Showa period ceramic funerary urn and reburied under a tombstone dedicated to Miura Anjin.

An urn matching the 1931 description was excavated in 2017. In 2019, Japanese archaeologists announced the discovery of bones at the site believed to be those of Adams. The subsequent mtDNA analysis had indicated that Adams&#x27; mitochondrial DNA likely belongs to haplogroup H. The analysis also showed aspects such as the dietary habits and burial style that matched with Adams. In April 2020, the University of Tokyo conducted conclusive forensic tests on the bones and confirmed it was William Adams&#x27; grave.

French literary critic Michel Foucault retold Adams&#x27; tale in &quot;The Discourse on Language&quot;. According to Foucault, the story embodies one of the &quot;great myths of European culture,&quot; and the idea that a mere sailor could teach mathematics to the Japanese &quot;shōgun&quot; shows the difference between the open exchange of knowledge in Europe, as opposed to the secretive control of knowledge under &quot;oriental tyranny&quot;. In fact, Adams was not a mere sailor but the chief navigator of the fleet, and his value to the &quot;shōgun&quot; was in his practical knowledge of shipbuilding.

=== Posthumous honours ===
* A town in Edo (modern Tokyo), Anjin-chō (in modern-day Nihonbashi) was named after Adams, who had a house there. Anjin-chō no longer exists in Nihonbashi and is now known as Nihonbashi Muromachi 1-Chōme. However within Muromachi 1-Chōme a street, Anjin-dori, remains named after Adams.
* Anjinzuka railroad station in his former fiefdom, Hemi, in modern Yokosuka were named for him.

* William Dalton wrote &quot;Will Adams, The First Englishman in Japan: A Romantic Biography&quot; (London, 1861).
* Richard Blaker&#x27;s &quot;The Needlewatcher&quot; (London, 1932) is the least romantic of the novels; he consciously attempted to de-mythologize Adams and write a careful historical work of fiction.
* James Scherer&#x27;s &quot;Pilot and Shōgun&quot; (1935) dramatises a series of incidents based on Adams&#x27; life.
* American Robert Lund wrote &quot;Daishi-san&quot; (New York, 1960).
* Christopher Nicole&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Golden Fan&quot; (1973) portrays Adams as sexually frustrated in England and freed by living in Japan, where he has numerous encounters. The work is considered light pornography.
* The 2002, Giles Milton historical biography called &quot;Samurai William&quot; (2002).
* Adams also serves as the template for the protagonist in the PlayStation 4 and PC video game series &quot;Nioh&quot; (2017) and non-playable character in its prequel/sequel hybrid game (2020), but with supernatural and historical fiction elements. Unlike the historical William Adams, the game portrays him as an Irishman.

===Origins of Western mythology===
According to Professor Derek Massarella of Chuo University in Tokyo, Adams was largely forgotten in England until the 1872 discovery of his alleged tomb in Japan led to a proliferation of myths and hyperbolic stories. Soon the public in England became embarrassed by the lack of their own monument or memorial to Adams in England; after years of lobbying, a memorial clock in Adams&#x27; honor was erected in Gillingham in 1934. The dedication pamphlet for this event includes an artist&#x27;s depiction of Adams which Massarella dismisses as a complete fabrication. As for the tomb that sparked the frenzy, Massarella, writing two decades before the forensic mtDNA study, concludes that it likely has nothing to do with Adams.

===Depiction===
Beyond speculative imagery (), there is one authenticated contemporaneous drawing of Adams: &quot;It is a derivative drawing of William Adams, which appears to be based in a sketch attributed to Dorothy Burmingham, from a description given by Melchior von Santvoort. The original drawing is to be found at the Rotterdam Maritime Museum, whose specialist Marcel Kroon considers it to be from Adams&#x27; time. A copy is preserved at the Bodleian Library, University of Oxford.&quot;

<text>Maidenhead is a market town in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead in the county of Berkshire, England. It lies on the southwestern bank of the River Thames, which at this point forms the border with Buckinghamshire. In the 2021 Census, the Maidenhead built-up area had a population of 67,375. The town is west of Charing Cross, London and east-northeast of Reading.

==History==
The antiquary John Leland claimed that the area around Maidenhead&#x27;s present town centre was a small Roman settlement called Alaunodunum. He stated that it had all but disappeared by the end of the Roman occupation. Although his source is unknown, there is documented and physical evidence of Roman settlement in the town. There are two well known villa sites in the town, one being in the suburb of Cox Green, and the other just west of the town centre on Castle Hill. This villa sat on the route of the Camlet Way which was a Roman road linking Silchester (Calleva Atrebatum) and Colchester (Camulodunum) via St Albans (Verulamium) and passes through the present town centre. Remnants of the road have been unearthed at various locations nearby, but its exact route is unclear.

Maidenhead&#x27;s name stems from the riverside area where the first &quot;New wharf&quot; or &quot;Maiden Hythe&quot; was built, as early as Saxon times. In the year 870, an army of Danes invaded the kingdom of Wessex. They disembarked from their longboats by the wharf and ferry crossing at Maidenhead and fought their way overland to Reading where they set up camp and made it their regional power base. The area of the present town centre was originally a small Anglo-Saxon town known as &quot;South Ellington&quot;. The town would have likely developed on the Camlet Way on the site of Alaunodunum as the Bath Road was not re-routed until the 13th century. Maidenhead is recorded in the Domesday Book as the settlement of Ellington in the hundred of Beynhurst.

A wooden bridge was erected across the river in about 1280 to replace the ferry in South Ellington. The Great West Road to Reading, Gloucester and Bristol was diverted over the new bridge. Previously, it had kept to the north bank and crossed the Thames by ford at Cookham, and the medieval town, later to become Maidenhead grew up on the site of Alaunodunum and South Ellington, between the new bridge and the bottom of Castle Hill. Within a few years a new wharf was constructed next to the bridge to replace the old Saxon wharf which needed replacing. At this time, the South Ellington name was dropped with the town becoming known as Maidenhythe. The earliest record of this name change is in the Bray Court manorial rolls of 1296.

The new bridge and wharf led to the growth of medieval Maidenhead as a river port and market town. The present town was developed as a linear settlement in the 13th century along the newly diverted road with hostelries, a guildhall and a chapel dedicated to St Mary Magdalene was built in the middle of the road. The market was held outside the old guildhall which was set back from the High Street to form the market square. Maidenhead also became the first stopping point for coaches travelling from London to Gloucester and Bath and the town became populated with numerous inns. By the mid 18th century, Maidenhead was one of the busiest coaching towns in England with over ninety coaches a day passing through the town. The late 18th-century Bear Hotel on the High Street is the best of the town&#x27;s old coaching inns surviving to this day.

King Charles I met his children for the last time before his execution in 1649 at the Greyhound Inn on the High Street, the site of which is now a branch of the NatWest Bank. A plaque commemorates their meeting. When the Great Western Railway came to the town, it began to expand. Muddy roads were replaced and public services were installed. The High Street began to change again, and substantial Victorian red brick architecture began to appear throughout the town. Maidenhead Citadel Corps of the Salvation Army was first opened in the town in the mid-1880s. Maidenhead Citadel Band was soon founded in 1886 by Bandmaster William Thomas, who later became mayor of the town. By Edwardian times, nearby Boulter&#x27;s Lock became a favoured resort, especially on Ascot Sunday, and Skindles Hotel developed a reputation for illicit liaisons.

==Governance==
There is one main tier of local government covering Maidenhead, at unitary authority level: the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead. Much of the Maidenhead urban area is unparished, but some outlying parts of the built-up area are included in civil parishes, notably at Cox Green to the south-west and Bray to the south. The borough council is based in Maidenhead, having its main offices at Maidenhead Town Hall on St Ives Road, which had been completed in 1962 for the former Maidenhead Borough Council.

The town of Maidenhead was formerly part of the Windsor and Maidenhead Parliament constituency, a Conservative safe seat. The Boundary Commission abolished this constituency for the 1997 general election since the electorate had become too large, splitting it into the new seats of Windsor and Maidenhead. The Maidenhead constituency includes rural parishes to the north, west and south of the town.

Maidenhead was held by the Conservatives at every election from its creation in 1997 until 2024. The former Prime Minister, Theresa May was elected MP in 1997 and represented Maidenhead until she stood down in 2024. The seat is now held by Joshua Reynolds of the Liberal Democrats .

===Administrative history===
Maidenhead was incorporated as a borough in 1582. The borough straddled the parishes of Bray and Cookham. It was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country. The Local Government Act 1894 directed that parishes were no longer allowed to straddle borough boundaries, and so a parish called Maidenhead was created covering the same area as the borough, and the parishes of Bray and Cookham were reduced to just cover the areas outside the borough.

The municipal borough and parish of Maidenhead were abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of the borough of Windsor and Maidenhead (which was allowed to use the style &#x27;royal borough&#x27; that had previously been used by Windsor). The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead became a unitary authority in 1998 when it took over the functions of the abolished Berkshire County Council.

==Geography==
The Maidenhead urban area includes urban and suburban regions within the bounds of the town, called Maidenhead Court, North Town, Furze Platt, Pinkneys Green, Highway, Tittle Row, Boyn Hill, Fishery and Bray Wick; as well as adjoining built-up areas in surrounding civil parishes: Cox Green and Altwood in Cox Green parish, Woodlands Park in White Waltham parish, and part of Bray Wick in Bray parish. Bray village is linked to Maidenhead by the exclusive Fishery Estate which lies on the west bank of the Thames.

To the east, on the opposite side of the river from Maidenhead, is the large village of Taplow in Buckinghamshire which almost adjoins the suburban village of Burnham, which itself nearly adjoins the urban area of the large, industrial town of Slough. To the north are the Cookhams: Cookham Village, Cookham Rise and Cookham Dean. To the west is the area of Pinkneys Green. These lie south of the Berkshire-Buckinghamshire border, which is formed by the River Thames (which then bends southwards to form the Maidenhead-Taplow border). Adjoining Bray and Bray Wick to the south is the suburban village of Holyport. Continuing by road to the south-east leads to the historic, royal twin towns of Windsor and Eton.

Maidenhead lies immediately west of the Taplow ridge, a wooded spur of the Chilterns which rises dramatically above one of the most scenic stretches of the Thames. The ridge is crowned by the spectacular Cliveden House which can be seen from various parts of the town. Maidenhead has a site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in the northern outskirts of the town called Cannoncourt Farm Pit, where the largest hand axe of the paleolithic era in Britain was discovered. The town also has a local nature reserve called The Gullet. On 12 July 1901 Maidenhead entered the UK Weather Records with the highest 60-min total rainfall at . As of January 2024, this record stands.

==Landmarks==

The current Maidenhead Bridge, a local landmark, dates from 1777 and was built at a cost of £19,000. It takes the A4 over the Thames to join Maidenhead to Taplow. All Saints&#x27; Church, Boyne Hill was completed in 1857 and is an early work by the architect G. E. Street. The church, consecrated on 2 December 1857 by Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, became the first ecclesiastical parish in the Borough of Maidenhead. Ten years later, in 1867, his brother William Wilberforce junior founded a Catholic chapel that led to St Joseph&#x27;s Church. Maidenhead clock tower was built for Queen Victoria&#x27;s diamond jubilee and stands outside the railway station. Boulter&#x27;s Lock is a lock on the river Thames on the east side of Maidenhead, adjoining Ray Mill Island. The town has a number of statues which form part of a recognisable image of the town, including the &#x27;Boy and the Boat&#x27; at the top end of the High Street, near the Methodist Church.

==Character==

Maidenhead has a long history of settlement, going back to the Anglo-Saxon and Roman periods. Despite this, there are no visible architectural remains in the present day town to show this. Although there are attractive residential and green areas in and around Maidenhead, the historic heart of the town has been redeveloped, primarily with office space, high technology company headquarters and apartments, making it one of the key business and commuter towns of the Silicon Corridor. This has happened in piecemeal fashion over the last forty years and Maidenhead town centre has lost most many historic buildings and much of its traditional English market town character. The High Street and Bridge Street areas only possess one heavily restored Medieval building and a handful of Georgian buildings in the Chapel Arches area.

Research by the New Economics Foundation rated Maidenhead as an example of a clone town and the town centre is regarded as in need of improvement. In December 2007, the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead set up the Partnership for the Regeneration of Maidenhead (PRoM), which in October 2008 launched a comprehensive 20 Year Vision and Action Plan for rejuvenating the town centre. Launch of the plan coincided with confirmation by central government that Maidenhead will be part of the new Crossrail project. PRoM&#x27;s plans highlight five key developments which will help shape the town for the future.

A large new retail and residential development called &#x27;The Landing&#x27; is due for construction shortly. Additionally there will be an upgraded railway station and transport interchange, movement of the leisure centre to Braywick Park, relocating the bowls club and improved links between Kidwells Park and the High Street. There are also plans to demolish the 1960s Nicholsons shopping centre and replace it with a new retail and residential quarter built around a network of revived historic streets and a micro brewery. A new town square featuring shops, restaurants and apartments is currently under construction between the central library and town hall.

The Chapel Arches retail and residential development is under construction. Part of the scheme involves restoring the old Thames tributaries which run through a historic section of the town centre. The redevelopment will bring an attractive waterfront quarter with new apartments, boutique stores, restaurants, bars, and cafes are to be a feature this new part of the town centre. The adjoining historic section of the High Street around the 18th century Chapel Arches Bridge has been restored as part of the development. Existing Georgian and Victorian buildings have been rejuvenated, and the adjoining new builds have been sensitively constructed in the same historic style to bring back a sense of history and lost heritage to this part of the town centre. Maidenhead was home to the amateur radio conference that agreed on the Maidenhead Locator System standard in 1980. It is located in grid square . The average house price in Maidenhead in January 2021 was £540,940.

==Community facilities==

Maidenhead offers High Street shopping facilities including Nicholson&#x27;s Centre, a shopping centre on the site of Nicholson&#x27;s brewery. The town also offers an eight-screen Odeon multiplex cinema. The local authority also provides a Shopmobility service, where those with physical disabilities can borrow mobility scooters to navigate around the town. Maidenhead Heritage Centre and Museum was established in 1993 and moved to permanent premises in a former pub in Park Street in 2006.

In the Boyne Hill area there is Norden Farm Centre for the Arts (an arts centre including a theatre). Waltham Place Estate on Church Hill is an organic and biodynamic farm estate, with an ornamental garden, which is supported by the Campaign to Protect Rural England. The Reitlinger Open Space on Guards Club Road is named after Henry Reitlinger, a leading collector of fine art. On his death in 1950, the collection was vested in a trust, the Henry Reitlinger Bequest. The trustees were his adopted daughter, Mrs. M. Cocke, and a Maidenhead solicitor, who chose to house the collection at Oldfield House, now a private residence; the building dates back to 1892.

The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead has built a new leisure centre in the town to replace the outdated Magnet Leisure Centre, east of Kidwells Park. The new facility, Braywick Leisure Centre, opened in September 2020. The town also has various community centres, including 4 Marlow Road, a youth and community centre, to the side of Kidwells Park near the town centre. Various activities take place here, including scheduled youth drop-in times as well as classes in dance provided privately in its large sports and dance studios. There is a publicly open gym at Furze Platt school, in North Maidenhead.

==Transport==

The Brunel-built Great Western Main Line and the 21st-century Elizabeth Line pass through the town, calling at Maidenhead station and offering direct services to London (Paddington and intermediate stations towards Liverpool Street, Shenfield, Canary Wharf and Abbey Wood), Reading, Didcot, and an hourly direct Sunday service to Swindon. The lines cross the Thames on Brunel&#x27;s Maidenhead Railway Bridge (known locally as the Sounding Arch), famous for its flat brick arches. Maidenhead station is the beginning of the Marlow Branch Line from Maidenhead to Marlow, Buckinghamshire; Furze Platt railway station on this branch serves the northern area of Maidenhead. Rail services are operated by Great Western, and since 2022 TfL Rail have operated the Elizabeth Line through the Thames Valley.

Local bus services are provided by First Berkshire &amp; The Thames Valley, Arriva Herts &amp; Essex and Thames Valley Buses. The A4 runs through the town and crosses the Thames over Maidenhead Bridge. The town lies adjacent to junction 8/9 on the M4 motorway which is accessed via the A404(M) and A308(M). The A308(M), A404(M) and A404 form the Marlow and Maidenhead bypass which also acts as a link between the M4, to the south of the town, and the M40 at High Wycombe. The River Thames runs to the east of the town centre, and York Stream, which runs through the town centre, connects to the Thames via a system of disused waterways. The Jubilee River, part of a flood defence scheme, begins above Boulter&#x27;s Lock nearby.

In the initial plan for Crossrail, Maidenhead was expected to become the terminus for the line, now known as the Elizabeth line. However, after consultation, Crossrail Limited and Transport for London decided to extend this to Reading, which also serves as a major hub for the Great Western route. Some of the stopping services from Paddington to Reading were taken over in 2018 by Crossrail&#x27;s precursor company, TfL Rail. The full timetable was introduced during the phased opening of the Elizabeth line in 2022.

Two miles to the south-west of the town lies White Waltham Airfield, a base for general aviation and flight training.

==Employment==
Maidenhead is in England&#x27;s Silicon Corridor along the M4 motorway west of London. Many residents commute to work in London, or to the nearby towns of Slough, Bracknell and Reading. Maidenhead&#x27;s industries include software, plastics, pharmaceuticals, printing and telecommunications.

==Sport==
Situated on the River Thames, the town is a rowing centre. Maidenhead Rowing Club organises the Maidenhead Regatta which, along with Marlow Regatta and Henley Regatta, is often seen as a testing ground for Olympic rowing athletes. Maidenhead has often seen winners go on to represent the United Kingdom at the Olympic Games. The town&#x27;s football team, Maidenhead United, play at York Road, which is the oldest football ground in the world continuously used by the same team. Maidenhead United were crowned champions of National League South at the end of the 2016/17 season. Due to this, the team were automatically promoted to the National League (fifth tier of English Football) for the 2017/18 season. The Maidenhead Rugby Club was founded in 1921 and is the largest organised sports team in the town. It consists of four men&#x27;s teams, a women&#x27;s team and a large youth programme.

==Institutions==
The local newspaper is &quot;The Maidenhead Advertiser&quot;. Maidenhead has been the home of Maidenhead Citadel Band of the Salvation Army since 1886. The head office of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission is based in Maidenhead on Marlow Road.

<text>John Eyton Bickersteth Mayor (28 January 1825 – 1 December 1910) was an English classical scholar, writer and vegetarianism activist.

==Biography==

=== Early life and education ===
Mayor was born at Baddegama, British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) the son of Rev. Robert Mayor and Charlotte Bickersteth. His mother came from the prominent Bickersteth family and was the sister of Henry Bickersteth, 1st Baron Langdale and Rev. Edward Bickersteth. He was sent to England to be educated at Shrewsbury School and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Joseph Bickersteth Mayor was his younger brother.

=== Career ===
From 1863 to 1867, Mayor was librarian of the University of Cambridge, and in 1872 succeeded H. A. J. Munro in the professorship of Latin, which he held for 28 years. His best-known work, an edition of the thirteen Satires of Juvenal, is notable for an extraordinary wealth of illustrative quotations. His &quot;Bibliographical Clue to Latin Literature&quot; (1875), based on Emil Hübner&#x27;s &quot;Grundriss zu Vorlesungen über die römische Litteraturgeschichte&quot;, was a valuable aid to students, and his edition of Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Second Philippic&quot; became widely used.

Mayor also edited the English works of John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester (1876); Thomas Baker&#x27;s &quot;History of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge&quot; (1869); Richard of Cirencester&#x27;s &quot;Speculum historiale de gestis regum Angliae 447–1066&quot; (1863–69); Roger Ascham&#x27;s &quot;Schoolmaster&quot; (new ed., 1883); the &quot;Latin Heptateuch&quot; (1889); and the &quot;Journal of Philology&quot;.

According to the &quot;Enciklopedio de Esperanto&quot;, Mayor learned Esperanto in 1907, and gave a historic speech against Esperanto reformists at the World Congress of Esperanto held at Cambridge.

=== Vegetarianism ===

Mayor succeeded Francis William Newman as president of the Vegetarian Society in 1884 and remained in that position till his death. He was a strict vegetarian and teetotaller but it was noted that &quot;he never sought to impose his rule of abstinence on others.&quot; Mayor authored &quot;What is Vegetarianism?&quot;, in 1886. His vegetarian writings were published in the book, &quot;Plain Living and High Thinking&quot; in 1897.

In October 1905, a meeting was held at Congregational Memorial Hall, London, for octogenarian vegetarians. Speakers in attendance included Mayor (then aged 84), Joseph Wallace, T. A. Hanson, C. P. Newcombe, Samuel Saunders, and Samuel Pitman, brother of Isaac Pitman.

Mayor ate a strict vegetarian diet and lived off twopence a day. His diet consisted of bread, fruit, porridge and vegetables with lemonade as his only drink.

=== Death ===
Mayor died on 1 December 1910 in Cambridge. He is buried in the Ascension Parish Burial Ground in Cambridge.

== Legacy ==
Mayor&#x27;s life and work are idiosyncratically and somewhat unsympathetically described in &quot;Juvenal&#x27;s Mayor: The Professor Who Lived on 2d. a Day&quot; by J. G. W. Henderson.

<doc id="206472" wikidata="Q2563885" url="?curid=206472" title="Color constancy">
<text>Color constancy is an example of subjective constancy and a feature of the human color perception system which ensures that the perceived color of objects remains relatively constant under varying illumination conditions. A green apple for instance looks green to us at midday, when the main illumination is white sunlight, and also at sunset, when the main illumination is red. This helps us identify objects.

==History==
Ibn al-Haytham gave an early explanation of color constancy by observing that the light reflected from an object is modified by the object&#x27;s color. He explained that the quality of the light and the color of the object are mixed, and the visual system separates light and color. He writes:Again the light does not travel from the colored object to the eye unaccompanied by the color, nor does the form of the color pass from the colored object to the eye unaccompanied by the light. Neither the form of the light nor that of the color existing in the colored object can pass except as mingled together and the last sentient can only perceive them as mingled together. Nevertheless, the sentient perceives that the visible object is luminous and that the light seen in the object is other than the color and that these are two properties. Monge (1789), Young (1807), von Helmholtz (1867), Hering (1920), and von Kries (1902, 1905), as well as subsequent researchers Helson and Jeffers (1940), Judd (1940), and Land and McCann (1971), have all made significant contributions to the investigation of colour constancy. The idea that the occurrence of colour constancy was the consequence of unconscious inference (Judd, 1940; von Helmholtz, 1867) and the idea that it was the result of sensory adaptation (Helson, 1943; Hering, 1920) coexisted for a significant portion of this time. To clarify the nature of observers&#x27; color-constancy judgements, Arend and Reeves (1986) conducted the first systematic behavioural experiments. Subsequently, new colour constancy models, physiological information on cortical mechanisms, and photographic colorimetric measurements of natural scenes all appeared.

==Color vision==

Color vision is how we perceive the objective color, which people, animals and machines are able to distinguish based on the different wavelengths of light reflected, transmitted, or emitted by the object. In humans, light is detected by the eye using two types of photoreceptors, cones and rods, which send signals to the visual cortex, which in turn processes those signals into a subjective perception. Color constancy is a process that allows the brain to recognize a familiar object as being a consistent color regardless of the amount or wavelengths of light reflecting from it at a given moment.

== Object illuminance ==
The phenomenon of color constancy occurs when the source of illumination is not directly known. It is for this reason that color constancy takes a greater effect on days with sun and clear sky as opposed to days that are overcast. Even when the sun is visible, color constancy may affect color perception. This is due to an ignorance of all possible sources of illumination. Although an object may reflect multiple sources of light into the eye, color constancy causes objective identities to remain constant.

D. H. Foster (2011) states, &quot;in the natural environment, the source itself may not be well defined in that the illumination at a particular point in a scene is usually a complex mixture of direct and indirect [light] distributed over a range of incident angles, in turn modified by local occlusion and mutual reflection, all of which may vary with time and position.&quot; The wide spectrum of possible illuminances in the natural environment and the limited ability of the human eye to perceive color means that color constancy plays a functional role in daily perception. Color constancy allows for humans to interact with the world in a consistent or veridical manner and it allows for one to more effectively make judgements on the time of day.

==Physiological basis==
The physiological basis for color constancy is thought to involve specialized neurons in the primary visual cortex that compute local ratios of cone activity, which is the same calculation that Land&#x27;s retinex algorithm uses to achieve color constancy. These specialized cells are called &quot;double-opponent cells&quot; because they compute both color opponency and spatial opponency. Double-opponent cells were first described by Nigel Daw in the goldfish retina. There was considerable debate about the existence of these cells in the primate visual system; their existence was eventually proven using reverse-correlation receptive field mapping and special stimuli that selectively activate single cone classes at a time, so-called &quot;cone-isolating&quot; stimuli. Human brain imaging evidence strongly suggests that a critical cortical locus for generating color constancy is located in cortical area V4, damage in which leads to the syndrome of cerebral achromatopsia.

Color constancy works only if the incident illumination contains a range of wavelengths. The different cone cells of the eye register different but overlapping ranges of wavelengths of the light reflected by every object in the scene. From this information, the visual system attempts to determine the approximate composition of the illuminating light. This illumination is then &quot;discounted&quot; in order to obtain the object&#x27;s &quot;true color&quot; or reflectance: the wavelengths of light the object reflects. This reflectance then largely determines the perceived color.

=== Neural mechanism ===
There are two possible mechanisms for color constancy. The first mechanism is unconscious inference. The second view holds this phenomenon to be caused by sensory adaptation. Research suggests color constancy to be related changes in retinal cells as well as cortical areas related to vision. This phenomenon is most likely attributed to changes in various levels of the visual system.

==== Cone adaptation ====
Cones, specialized cells within the retina, will adjust relative to light levels within the local environment. This occurs at the level of individual neurons. However, this adaptation is incomplete. Chromatic adaptation is also regulated by processes within the brain. Research in monkeys suggest that changes in chromatic sensitivity is correlated to activity in parvocellular lateral geniculate neurons. Color constancy may be both attributed to localized changes in individual retinal cells or to higher level neural processes within the brain.

== Metamerism ==
Metamerism, the perceiving of colors within two separate scenes, can help to inform research regarding color constancy. Research suggests that when competing chromatic stimuli are presented, spatial comparisons must be completed early in the visual system. For example, when subjects are presented stimuli in a dichoptic fashion, an array of colors and a void color, such as grey, and are told to focus on a specific color of the array, the void color appears different than when perceived in a binocular fashion. This means that color judgements, as they relate to spatial comparisons, must be completed at or prior to the V1 monocular neurons. If spatial comparisons occur later in the visual system such as in cortical area V4, the brain would be able to perceive both the color and void color as though they were seen in a binocular fashion.

==Retinex theory==
The &quot;Land effect&quot; is the capacity to see full color images solely by looking at superimposed images of black and white transparancies of the same scene, one taken through a red filter and the other taken through a green filter, and illuminated by red and white light, respectively (or even by two different yellow wavelengths). The effect was discovered by Edwin H. Land, who was attempting to reconstruct James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s early experiments in full-colored images. Land saw that, even when only yellow light illuminated the superimposed images, the visual system would still perceive a full (if muted) range of color. Land described this effect in a 1959 article in &quot;Scientific American.&quot; In 1977, Land wrote another &quot;Scientific American&quot; article that described a generalized Land effect, leading to formulation of his &quot;Retinex Theory&quot; to explain what he believed was main basis of human color vision. The word &quot;retinex&quot; is a blend of &quot;retina&quot; and &quot;cortex&quot;, suggesting that both the eye and the brain are involved in the processing.

The generalized Land effect can be experimentally demonstrated as follows. A display called a &quot;Mondrian&quot; (after Piet Mondrian whose paintings are similar) consisting of numerous colored patches is shown to a person. The display is illuminated by three white lights, one projected through a red filter, one projected through a green filter, and one projected through a blue filter. The person is asked to adjust the intensity of the lights so that a particular patch in the display appears white. The experimenter then measures the intensities of red, green, and blue light reflected from this white-appearing patch. Then the experimenter asks the person to identify the color of a neighboring patch, which, for example, appears green. Then the experimenter adjusts the lights so that the intensities of red, blue, and green light reflected from the green patch are the same as were originally measured from the white patch. The person shows color constancy in that the green patch continues to appear green, the white patch continues to appear white, and all the remaining patches continue to have their original colors.

Land, with John McCann, also developed a computer program designed to imitate the retinex processes thought to be taking place in human physiology. Color constancy is a desirable feature of computer vision, and many algorithms have been developed for this purpose. These include several retinex algorithms. These algorithms receive as input the red/green/blue values of each pixel of the image and attempt to estimate the reflectances of each point. One such algorithm operates as follows: the maximal red value &quot;r&quot;max of all pixels is determined, and also the maximal green value &quot;g&quot;&quot;max&quot; and the maximal blue value . Assuming that the scene contains objects which reflect all red light, and (other) objects which reflect all green light and still others which reflect all blue light, one can then deduce that the illuminating light source is described by (&quot;r&quot;max, &quot;g&quot;max, &quot;b&quot;max). For each pixel with values (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) its reflectance is estimated as (&quot;r&quot;/&quot;r&quot;max, &quot;g&quot;/&quot;g&quot;max, &quot;b&quot;/&quot;b&quot;max). The original retinex algorithm proposed by Land and McCann uses a localized version of this principle.

Although retinex models are still widely used in computer vision, actual human color perception has been shown to be more complex.

<text>Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro (29 October 1819 – 30 March 1885) was a British classical scholar.

==Biography==
Munro was born at Elgin, Moray, Scotland, the illegitimate son of Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro of Novar by Penelope Forbes, and educated at Shrewsbury School, where he was one of Benjamin Hall Kennedy&#x27;s first pupils. He went on to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1838, becoming a scholar in 1840, second classic and first chancellor&#x27;s medallist in 1842, and fellow of his college in 1843. He became classical lecturer at Trinity College, and in 1869 was elected to the newly founded chair of Latin at Cambridge, but resigned it in 1872.

The great work on which his reputation rests is his edition of Lucretius, the fruit of many years&#x27; efforts (text only, 1 vol., 1860; text, commentary and translation, 2 vols, 1864). As a textual critic his knowledge was profound and his judgment unrivalled; and he studied archaeology, being a frequent traveller in Italy and Greece. In 1867 he published an improved text of &quot;Aetna&quot; with commentary, and in the following year a text of Horace with critical introduction, illustrated by specimens of ancient gems selected by Charles William King. His knowledge and taste are nowhere better shown than in his &quot;Criticisms and Elucidations&quot; of Catullus (1878). He was a master of the art of Greek and Latin verse composition. His contributions to the famous volume of Shrewsbury verse, &quot;Sabrinae corolla&quot;, are among the most remarkable of the collection. He communicated with Thomas Saunders Evans.

His &quot;Translations into Latin and Greek Verse&quot; were privately printed in 1884. Like his translations into English, these are characterized by minute fidelity to the original, but never cease to be idiomatic. He died while visiting Rome.

A &quot;Memoir&quot; by J. D. Duff was prefixed to a re-issue of the translation of Lucretius in &quot;Bohn&#x27;s Classical Library&quot; (1908).

<doc id="206481" wikidata="Q128904" url="?curid=206481" title="Elam">
<text>Elam () was an ancient civilization centered in the far west and southwest of modern-day Iran, stretching from the lowlands of what is now Khuzestan and Ilam Province as well as a small part of southern Iraq. The modern name &quot;Elam&quot; stems from the Sumerian transliteration &quot;elam(a)&quot;, along with the later Akkadian &quot;elamtu&quot;, and the Elamite &quot;haltamti.&quot; Elamite states were among the leading political forces of the Ancient Near East. In classical literature, Elam was also known as Susiana ( ; &quot;Sousiānḗ&quot;), a name derived from its capital Susa.

Elam was part of the early urbanization of the Near East during the Chalcolithic period (Copper Age). The emergence of written records from around 3000 BC also parallels Sumerian history, where slightly earlier records have been found. In the Old Elamite period (Middle Bronze Age), Elam consisted of kingdoms on the Iranian plateau, centered in Anshan, and from the mid-2nd millennium BC, it was centered in Susa in the Khuzestan lowlands. Its culture played a crucial role during the Persian Achaemenid dynasty that succeeded Elam, when the Elamite language remained among those in official use. Elamite is generally considered a language isolate or unrelated to any other languages. According to Daniel T. Potts, Walther Hinz was less cautious in suggesting that the Elamites were ‘Proto-Lurs’ — that is, ancestors of the inhabitants of modern-day Lurestan in western Iran.

==Etymology==
The Elamite language endonym of Elam as a country appears to have been &quot;Hatamti&quot; ( in Linear Elamite), or &quot;Haltamti&quot; (Cuneiform Elamite: ).

Exonyms included the Sumerian names &quot;ELAM.MAki&quot;𒉏𒈠𒆠 and &quot;ELAM&quot;, the Akkadian &quot;Elamû&quot; (masculine/neuter) and &quot;Elamītu&quot; (feminine) meant &quot;resident of Susiana, Elamite&quot;. The Sumerian term &quot;elam&quot; also referred to the highlands.

Walter Hintz, the great scientist of Iranology, during genetic experiments and its matching on the regions and inscriptions left by the ancestors of the Elamites, attributed them to the people of Lor.

In prehistory, Elam was centered primarily in modern Khuzestān and Ilam. The name Khuzestān is derived ultimately from (&quot;hūja&quot;) meaning Susa/Elam. This became (&quot;hūz&quot;) &quot;Susiana&quot;, and in modern (&quot;xuz&quot;), compounded with the toponymic suffix &quot;-stån&quot; &quot;place&quot;.

==Geography==
In geographical terms, Susiana basically represents the Iranian province of Khuzestan around the river Karun. In ancient times, several names were used to describe this area. The ancient geographer Ptolemy was the earliest to call the area &quot;Susiana&quot;, referring to the country around Susa.

Another ancient geographer, Strabo, viewed Elam and Susiana as two different geographic regions. He referred to Elam (&quot;land of the Elymaei&quot;) as primarily the highland area of Khuzestan.

Disagreements over the location also exist in the Jewish historical sources says Daniel T. Potts. Some ancient sources draw a distinction between Elam as the highland area of Khuzestan, and Susiana as the lowland area. Yet in other ancient sources &#x27;Elam&#x27; and &#x27;Susiana&#x27; seem equivalent.

The uncertainty in this area extends also to modern scholarship. Since the discovery of ancient Anshan, and the realization of its great importance in Elamite history, the definitions were changed again. Some modern scholars argued that the center of Elam lay at Anshan and in the highlands around it, and not at Susa in lowland Khuzistan.

Potts disagrees suggesting that the term &#x27;Elam&#x27; was primarily constructed by the Mesopotamians to describe the area in general terms, without referring specifically either to the lowlanders or the highlanders,

Elam is not an Iranian term and has no relationship to the conception which the peoples of highland Iran had of themselves. They were Anshanites, Marhashians, Shimashkians, Zabshalians, Sherihumians, Awanites, etc. That Anshan played a leading role in the political affairs of the various highland groups inhabiting southwestern Iran is clear. But to argue that Anshan is coterminous with Elam is to misunderstand the artificiality and indeed the alienness of Elam as a construct imposed from without on the peoples of the southwestern highlands of the Zagros mountain range, the coast of Fars and the alluvial plain drained by the Karun-Karkheh river system.

==History==
Prehistorically the area was well settled during the Ubaid period and shared many aspects of Ubaid cultures.

Knowledge of Elamite history remains largely fragmentary, reconstruction being based on mainly Mesopotamian (Sumerian, Akkadian, Assyrian and Babylonian) sources. The history of Elam is conventionally divided into three periods, spanning more than two millennia. The period before the first Elamite period is known as the proto-Elamite period:
* Proto-Elamite: c. 3200 – c. 2700 BC (Proto-Elamite script in Susa)
* Old Elamite period: c. 2700 – c. 1500 BC (earliest documents until the Sukkalmah Dynasty)
* Middle Elamite period: c. 1500 – c. 1100 BC (Anzanite dynasty until the Babylonian invasion of Susa)
* Neo-Elamite period: c. 1100 – 540 BC (characterized by Assyrian and Median influence. 539 BC marks the beginning of the Achaemenid period.)

===Proto-Elamite (c. 3200 – c. 2700 BC)===

Proto-Elamite civilization grew up east of the Tigris and Euphrates alluvial plains; it was a combination of the lowlands and the immediate highland areas to the north and east. At least three proto-Elamite states merged to form Elam: Anshan, Awan, and Shimashki. References to Awan are generally older than those to Anshan, and some scholars suggest that both states encompassed the same territory, in different eras (see Hanson, Encyclopædia Iranica). To this core Shushiana was periodically annexed and broken off. In addition, some Proto-Elamite sites are found well outside this area, spread out on the Iranian plateau; such as Warakshe, Sialk (now a suburb of the modern city of Kashan) and Jiroft in Kerman Province. The state of Elam was formed from these lesser states as a response to invasion from Sumer during the Old Elamite period. Elamite strength was based on an ability to hold these various areas together under a coordinated government that permitted the maximum interchange of the natural resources unique to each region. Traditionally, this was done through a federated governmental structure.

The Proto-Elamite city of Susa was founded around 4000 BC in the watershed of the river Karun. It is considered to be the site of Proto-Elamite cultural formation. During its early history, it fluctuated between submission to Mesopotamian and Elamite power. The earliest levels (22–17 in the excavations conducted by Le Brun, 1978) exhibit pottery that has no equivalent in Mesopotamia, but for the succeeding period, the excavated material allows identification with the culture of Sumer of the Uruk period. Proto-Elamite influence from Mesopotamia in Susa becomes visible from about 3200 BC, and texts in the still undeciphered Proto-Elamite writing system continue to be present until about 2700 BC. The Proto-Elamite period ends with the establishment of the Awan dynasty. The earliest known historical figure connected with Elam is the king Enmebaragesi of Kish (c. 2650 BC?), who subdued it, according to the Sumerian king list. Elamite history can only be traced from records dating to beginning of the Akkadian Empire (2335–2154 BC) onwards.

The Proto-Elamite states in Jiroft and Zabol (not universally accepted), present a special case because of their great antiquity.

In ancient Luristan, bronze-making tradition goes back to the mid-3rd millennium BC, and has many Elamite connections. Bronze objects from several cemeteries in the region date to the Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia) I, and to Ur-III period c. 2900–2000 BC. These excavations include Kalleh Nisar, Bani Surmah, Chigha Sabz, Kamtarlan, Sardant, and Gulal-i Galbi.

===Old Elamite period (c. 2700 – c. 1500 BC)===

The Old Elamite period began around 2700 BC. Historical records mention the conquest of Elam by Enmebaragesi, the Sumerian king of Kish in Mesopotamia. Three dynasties ruled during this period. Twelve kings of each of the first two dynasties, those of Awan (or &quot;Avan&quot;; c. 2400 – c. 2100 BC) and Simashki (c. 2100 – c. 1970 BC), are known from a list from Susa dating to the Old Babylonian period. Two Elamite dynasties said to have exercised brief control over parts of Sumer in very early times include Awan and Hamazi; and likewise, several of the stronger Sumerian rulers, such as Eannatum of Lagash and Lugal-anne-mundu of Adab, are recorded as temporarily dominating Elam.

====Awan dynasty====

The Awan dynasty (2350–2150 BC) was partly contemporary with that of the Mesopotamian emperor Sargon of Akkad, who not only defeated the Awan king Luh-ishan and subjected Susa, but attempted to make the East Semitic Akkadian the official language there. From this time, Mesopotamian sources concerning Elam become more frequent, since the Mesopotamians had developed an interest in resources (such as wood, stone, and metal) from the Iranian plateau, and military expeditions to the area became more common. With the collapse of Akkad under Sargon&#x27;s great-great-grandson, Shar-kali-sharri, Elam declared independence under the last Awan king, Kutik-Inshushinak (c. 2240 – c. 2220 BC), and threw off the Akkadian language, promoting in its place the brief Linear Elamite script. Kutik-Inshushinnak conquered Susa and Anshan, and seems to have achieved some sort of political unity. Following his reign, the Awan dynasty collapsed as Elam was temporarily overrun by the Guti, another pre-Iranic people from what is now north west Iran who also spoke a language isolate.

====Shimashki dynasty====
About a century later, the Sumerian king Shulgi of the Neo-Sumerian Empire retook the city of Susa and the surrounding region. During the first part of the rule of the Simashki dynasty, Elam was under intermittent attack from the Sumerians of Mesopotamia and also Gutians from northwestern Iran, alternating with periods of peace and diplomatic approaches. The Elamite state of Simashki at this time also extended into northern Iran, and possibly even as far as the Caspian Sea. Shu-Sin of Ur gave one of his daughters in marriage to a prince of Anshan. But the power of the Sumerians was waning; Ibbi-Sin in the 21st century did not manage to penetrate far into Elam, and in 2004 BC, the Elamites, allied with the people of Susa and led by king Kindattu, the sixth king of Simashki, managed to sack Ur and lead Ibbi-Sin into captivity, ending the third dynasty of Ur. The Akkadian kings of Isin, successor state to Ur, managed to drive the Elamites out of Ur, rebuild the city, and to return the statue of Nanna that the Elamites had plundered.

====Sukkalmah dynasty====

The succeeding dynasty, often called the Sukkalmah dynasty (c. 1970 – c. 1770 BC) after &quot;Great regents&quot;, the title borne by its members, also called the Epartid dynasty after the name of its founder Ebarat/ Eparti, was roughly contemporary with the Old Assyrian Empire, and Old Babylonian period in Mesopotamia, being younger by approximately sixty years than the Akkadian-speaking Old Assyrian Empire in Upper Mesopotamia, and almost seventy-five years older than the Old Babylonian Empire. This period is said by many to be confusing and difficult to reconstruct. It was apparently founded by Eparti I. During this time, Susa was under Elamite control, but Akkadian-speaking Mesopotamian states such as Larsa and Isin continually tried to retake the city. Around 1850 BC Kudur-Mabuk, apparently king of another Akkadian state to the north of Larsa, managed to install his son, Warad-Sin, on the throne of Larsa, and Warad-Sin&#x27;s brother, Rim-Sin, succeeded him and conquered much of southern Mesopotamia for Larsa.

Notable Eparti dynasty rulers in Elam during this time include Suruhduh/Siruk-tuh/Sirukdukh (c. 1850 BC), who entered various military coalitions to contain the power of the south Mesopotamian states. Siruk-tuh was the king of Elam when Hammurabi first ruled, he and later kings of the Elamite dynasty were referred to as &quot;great king&quot; and &quot;father&quot; by kings in Syria and Mesopotamia and were the only kings that the Mesopotamian Kings considered to be higher in status than themselves. Siwe-Palar-Khuppak, who for some time was the most powerful person in the area, respectfully addressed as &quot;Father&quot; by Mesopotamian kings such as Zimrilim of Mari, Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria, and even Hammurabi of Babylon. During his reign alone, Elam interfered extensively with Mesopotamian politics, allowing messengers and envoys to travel far west to Emar and Qatna in Syria. His messenger reached Emar and sent his three servants to King Amut-piʾel II of Qatna (1772–1762 BC), and the king of Qatna also sent two messengers to Elam. The Elamite rulers had become increasingly involved in Mesopotamian politics during the Sukkalmah dynasty. In fact, Rim-Sin of Larsa himself was of Elamite descent, notwithstanding his Akkadian name. Kudur-Nahhunte, who plundered the temples of southern Mesopotamia, the north being under the control of the Old Assyrian Empire. But Elamite influence in southern Mesopotamia did not last. Around 1760 BC, Hammurabi drove out the Elamites, overthrew Rim-Sin of Larsa, and established a short lived Babylonian Empire in Mesopotamia. Little is known about the latter part of this dynasty, since sources again become sparse with the Kassite rule of Babylon (from c. 1595 BC).

===Trade with the Indus Valley civilization===
Many archaeological finds suggest that maritime trade along the shores of Africa and Asia started several millennia ago. Trade between the Indus Valley civilization and the cities of Mesopotamia and Elam, can be inferred from numerous find of Indus artifacts, particularly in the excavation at Susa. Various objects made with shell species that are characteristic of the Indus coast, particularly &quot;Trubinella pyrum&quot; and &quot;Fasciolaria trapezium&quot;, have been found in the archaeological sites of Mesopotamia and Susa dating from around 2500–2000 BC. Carnelian beads from the Indus were found in Susa in the excavation of the tell of the citadel. In particular, carnelian beads with an etched design in white were probably imported from the Indus Valley, and made according to a technique of acid-etching developed by the Harappans.

Exchanges seem to have waned after 1900 BC, together with the disappearance of the Indus valley civilization.

===Middle Elamite period (c. 1500 – c. 1100 BC)===
====Anshan and Susa====
The Middle Elamite period began with the rise of the Anshanite dynasties around 1500 BC. Their rule was characterized by an &quot;Elamisation&quot; of Susa, and the kings took the title &quot;king of Anshan and Susa&quot;. While the first of these dynasties, the Kidinuids continued to use the Akkadian language frequently in their inscriptions, the succeeding Igihalkids and Shutrukids used Elamite with increasing regularity. Likewise, Elamite language and culture grew in importance in Susiana. The Kidinuids (c. 1500 – 1400 BC) are a group of five rulers of uncertain affiliation. They are identified by their use of the older title, &quot;king of Susa and of Anshan&quot;, and by calling themselves &quot;servant of Kirwashir&quot;, an Elamite deity, thereby introducing the pantheon of the highlands to Susiana. The city of Susa itself is one of the oldest in the world dating back to around 4200 BC. Since its founding Susa was known as a central power location for the Elamites and for later Persian dynasties. Susa&#x27;s power would peak during the Middle Elamite period, when it would be the region&#x27;s capital.

====Kassite invasions====
Of the Igehalkids (c. 1400 – 1210 BC), ten rulers are known, though their number was possibly larger. Some of them married Kassite princesses. The Kassites were also a language isolate speaking people from the Zagros Mountains who had taken Babylonia shortly after its sacking by the Hittite Empire in 1595 BC. The Kassite king of Babylon Kurigalzu II who had been installed on the throne by Ashur-uballit I of the Middle Assyrian Empire (1366–1020 BC), temporarily occupied Elam around 1320 BC, and later (c. 1230 BC) another Kassite king, Kashtiliash IV, fought Elam unsuccessfully. Kassite-Babylonian power waned, as they became dominated by the northern Mesopotamian Middle Assyrian Empire. Kiddin-Khutran of Elam repulsed the Kassites by defeating Enlil-nadin-shumi in 1224 BC and Adad-shuma-iddina around 1222–1217 BC. Under the Igehalkids, Akkadian inscriptions were rare, and Elamite highland gods became firmly established in Susa.

====Elamite Empire====

Under the Shutrukids (c. 1210 – 1100 BC), the Elamite empire reached the height of its power. Shutruk-Nakhkhunte and his three sons, Kutir-Nakhkhunte II, Shilhak-In-Shushinak, and Khutelutush-In-Shushinak were capable of frequent military campaigns into Kassite Babylonia (which was also being ravaged by the empire of Assyria during this period), and at the same time were exhibiting vigorous construction activity—building and restoring luxurious temples in Susa and across their Empire. Shutruk-Nakhkhunte raided Babylonia, carrying home to Susa trophies like the statues of Marduk and Manishtushu, the Manishtushu Obelisk, the Stele of Hammurabi and the stele of Naram-Sin. In 1158 BC, after much of Babylonia had been annexed by Ashur-Dan I of Assyria and Shutruk-Nakhkhunte, the Elamites defeated the Kassites permanently, killing the Kassite king of Babylon, Zababa-shuma-iddin, and replacing him with his eldest son, Kutir-Nakhkhunte, who held it no more than three years before being ejected by the native Akkadian-speaking Babylonians. The Elamites then briefly came into conflict with Assyria, managing to take the Assyrian city of Arrapha (modern Kirkuk) before being ultimately defeated and having a treaty forced upon them by Ashur-Dan I.

Kutir-Nakhkhunte&#x27;s son Khutelutush-In-Shushinak was probably born of Kutir-Nakhkhunte and his own daughter, Nakhkhunte-utu. He was defeated by Nebuchadnezzar I of Babylon, who sacked Susa and returned the statue of Marduk, but who was then himself defeated by the Assyrian king Ashur-resh-ishi I. He fled to Anshan, but later returned to Susa, and his brother Shilhana-Hamru-Lagamar may have succeeded him as last king of the Shutrukid dynasty. Following Khutelutush-In-Shushinak, the power of the Elamite empire began to wane seriously, as after the death of this ruler, Elam disappears into obscurity for more than three centuries.

===Neo-Elamite period (c. 1100 – 540 BC)===
====Neo-Elamite I (c. 1100 – c. 770 BC)====
Very little is known of this period. Anshan was still at least partially Elamite. There appear to have been unsuccessful alliances of Elamites, Babylonians, Chaldeans and other peoples against the powerful Neo Assyrian Empire (911–605 BC); the Babylonian king Mar-biti-apla-ushur (984–979 BC) was of Elamite origin, and Elamites are recorded to have fought unsuccessfully with the Babylonian king Marduk-balassu-iqbi against the Assyrian forces under Shamshi-Adad V (823–811 BC).

====Neo-Elamite II (c. 770 – 646 BC)====

The later Neo-Elamite period is characterized by a significant migration of Indo-European speaking Iranians to the Iranian plateau. Assyrian sources beginning around 800 BC distinguish the &quot;powerful Medes&quot;, i.e. the actual Medes, Persians, Parthians, Sagartians, etc. Among these pressuring tribes were the &quot;Parsu&quot;, first recorded in 844 BC as living on the southeastern shore of Lake Urmiah, but who by the end of this period would cause the Elamites&#x27; original home, the Iranian Plateau, to be renamed Persia proper. These newly arrived Iranian peoples were also conquered by Assyria, and largely regarded as vassals of the Neo-Assyrian Empire until the late 7th century.

More details are known from the late 8th century BC, when the Elamites were allied with the Chaldean chieftain Merodach-baladan to defend the cause of Babylonian independence from Assyria. Humban-nikash I (743–717 BC) supported Merodach-baladan against Sargon II, apparently without success; while his successor, Shutruk-Nahhunte II (716–699 BC), was routed by Sargon&#x27;s troops during an expedition in 710, and another Elamite defeat by Sargon&#x27;s troops is recorded for 708. The Assyrian dominion over Babylon was underlined by Sargon&#x27;s son Sennacherib, who defeated the Elamites, Chaldeans and Babylonians and dethroned Merodach-baladan for a second time, installing his own son Ashur-nadin-shumi on the Babylonian throne in 700.

Shutruk-Nakhkhunte II, the last Elamite to claim the old title &quot;king of Anshan and Susa&quot;, was murdered by his brother Hallutash-Inshushinak I, who managed to briefly capture the Assyrian governor of Babylonia Ashur-nadin-shumi and the city of Babylon in 694 BC. Sennacherib soon responded by invading and ravaging Elam. Khallushu was in turn assassinated by Kutir-Nahhunte III, who succeeded him but soon abdicated in favor of Humban-numena III (692–689 BC). Khumma-Menanu recruited a new army to help the Babylonians and Chaldeans against the Assyrians at the battle of Halule in 691. Both sides claimed the victory in their annals, but Babylon was destroyed by Sennacherib only two years later, and its Elamite allies defeated in the process.

The reigns of Humban-Haltash I (688–681 BC) and Humban-Haltash II (680–675 BC) saw a deterioration of Elamite-Babylonian relations, and both of them raided Sippar. At the beginning of Esarhaddon&#x27;s reign in Assyria (681–669 BC), Nabu-zer-kitti-lišir, an ethnically Elamite governor in the south of Babylonia, revolted and besieged Ur, but was routed by the Assyrians and fled to Elam where the king of Elam, fearing Assyrian repercussions, took him prisoner and put him to the sword.

Urtaku (674–664 BC) for some time wisely maintained good relations with the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal (668–627 BC), who sent wheat to Susiana during a famine. But these friendly relations were only temporary, and Urtaku was killed in battle during a failed Elamite attack on Assyria.

His successor Tepti-Humban-Inshushinak (664–653 BC) attacked Assyria, but was defeated and killed by Ashurbanipal following the battle of the Ulaï in 653 BC; and Susa itself was sacked and occupied by the Assyrians. In this same year the Assyrian vassal Median state to the north fell to the invading Scythians and Cimmerians under Madyes, and displacing another Assyrian vassal people, the &quot;Parsu&quot; (Persians) to Anshan which their king Teispes captured that same year, turning it for the first time into an Indo-Iranian kingdom under Assyrian dominance that would a century later become the nucleus of the Achaemenid dynasty. The Assyrians successfully subjugated and drove the Scythians and Cimmerians from their Iranian colonies, and the Persians, Medes and Parthians remained vassals of Assyria.

A brief respite to the Elamites was provided by the civil war between Ashurbanipal and his own brother Shamash-shum-ukin, whom their father Esarhaddon had installed as the vassal king of Babylon. The Elamites gave support to Shamash-shum-ukin, but also engaged in fighting among themselves. Babylon was besieged in midsummer of 650 BC, and fell by 648 BC; Shamash-shum-ukin died in a fire. The Elamite kingdom was greatly weakened by rebellions and civil wars; kings from 651 to 640 had short reigns before being usurped, overthrown, or captured by the Assyrians. Having dealt with his brother, Ashurbanipal sensed an opportunity to devastate Elam. In 646 BC Ashurbanipal devastated Susiana with ease, and sacked Susa. He installed several vassal kings such as Tammaritu, although these quickly broke off relations with Assyria over their pillages. The last Elamite king, Humban-Haltash III, was captured in 640 BC by Ashurbanipal, who annexed and destroyed the country.

In a tablet unearthed in 1854 by Austen Henry Layard, Ashurbanipal boasts of the destruction he had wrought:

====Neo-Elamite III (646–539 BC)====
The devastation was a little less complete than Ashurbanipal boasted, and a weak and fragmented Elamite rule was resurrected soon after with Shuttir-Nakhkhunte, son of Humban-umena III (not to be confused with Shuttir-Nakhkhunte, son of Indada, a petty king in the first half of the 6th century). Elamite royalty in the final century preceding the Achaemenids was fragmented among different small kingdoms, the united Elamite nation having been destroyed and colonised by the Assyrians. The three kings at the close of the 7th century (Shuttir-Nakhkhunte, Khallutush-In-Shushinak and Atta-Khumma-In-Shushinak) still called themselves &quot;king of Anzan and of Susa&quot; or &quot;enlarger of the kingdom of Anzan and of Susa&quot;, at a time when the Achaemenid Persians were already ruling Anshan under Assyrian dominance.

The various Assyrian Empires, which had been the dominant force in the Near East, Asia Minor, the Caucasus, North Africa, Arabian peninsula and East Mediterranean for much of the period from the first half of the 14th century BC, began to unravel after the death of Ashurbanipal in 631 BC, descending into a series of bitter internal civil wars which also spread to Babylonia. The Iranian Medes, Parthians, Persians and Sagartians, who had been largely subject to Assyria since their arrival in the region around 1000 BC, quietly took full advantage of the anarchy in Assyria, and in 616 BC freed themselves from Assyrian rule.

The Medians took control of Elam during this period. Cyaxares the king of the Medes, Persians, Parthians and Sagartians entered into an alliance with a coalition of fellow former vassals of Assyria, including Nabopolassar of Babylon and Chaldea, and also the Scythians and Cimmerians, against Sin-shar-ishkun of Assyria, who was faced with unremitting civil war in Assyria itself. This alliance then attacked a disunited and war weakened Assyria, and between 616 BC and 599 BC at the very latest, had conquered its vast empire which stretched from the Caucasus Mountains to Egypt, Libya and the Arabian Peninsula, and from Cyprus and Ephesus to Persia and the Caspian Sea.

The major cities in Assyria itself were gradually taken; Arrapha (modern Kirkuk) and Kalhu (modern Nimrud) in 616 BC, Ashur, Dur-Sharrukin and Arbela (modern Erbil) in 613, Nineveh falling in 612, Harran in 608 BC, Carchemish in 605 BC, and finally Dur-Katlimmu by 599 BC. Elam, already largely destroyed and subjugated by Assyria, thus became easy prey for the Median dominated Iranian peoples, and was incorporated into the Median Empire (612–546 BC) and then the succeeding Achaemenid Empire (546–332 BC), with Assyria suffering the same fate. (see Achaemenid Assyria, Athura).

The prophet Ezekiel describes the status of their power in the 12th year of the Hebrew Babylonian Captivity in 587 BC:

Their successors Khumma-Menanu and Shilhak-In-Shushinak II bore the simple title &quot;king&quot;, and the final king Tempti-Khumma-In-Shushinak used no honorific at all. In 540 BC, Achaemenid rule began in Susa.

===Elymais (187 BC – 224 AD)===
Elymaïs was the location of the death of Antiochus III the Great who was killed while pillaging a temple of Bel in 187 BC. Following the rise and fall of the Achaemenid Empire and the Seleucid Empire, a new dynasty of Elamite rulers established Elymais from 147 BC to 224 AD, usually under the suzerainty of the Parthian Empire, until the advent of the unified Sasanian Empire in 224 AD.

==Art==
===Statuettes===
Dated to approximately the 12th century BC, gold and silver figurines of Elamite worshippers are shown carrying a sacrificial goat. These divine and royal statues were meant to assure the king of the enduring protection of the deity, well-being and a long life. Works which showed a ruler and his performance of a ritual action were intended to eternalize the effectiveness of such deeds. Found near the Temple of Inshushinak in Susa, these statuettes would have been considered charged with beneficial power.

While archaeologists cannot be certain that the location where these figures were found indicates a date before or in the time of the Elamite king Shilhak-Inshushinak, stylistic features can help ground the figures in a specific time period. The hairstyle and costume of the figures which are strewn with dots and hemmed with short fringe at the bottom, and the precious metals point to a date in the latter part of the second millennium BC rather than to the first millennium.

In general, any gold or silver statuettes which represent the king making a sacrifice not only served a religious function, but was also a display of wealth.

===Seals===
Elamite seals reached their peak of complexity in the 4th millennium BC when their shape became cylindrical rather than stamp-like. Seals were primarily used as a form of identification and were often made out of precious stones. Because seals for different time periods had different designs and themes, seals and seal impressions can be used to track the various phases of the Elamite Empire and can teach a lot about the empire in ways which other forms of documentation cannot.

The seal pictured shows two seated figures holding cups with a man in front of them wearing a long robe next to a table. A man is sitting on a throne, presumably the king, and is in a wrapped robe. The second figure, perhaps his queen, is draped in a wide, flounced garment and is elevated on a platform beneath an overhanging vine. A crescent is shown in the field.

===Statue of Queen Napir-Asu===
This life-size votive offering of Queen Napir-Asu was commissioned around 1300 BC in Susa, Iran. It is made of copper using the lost-wax casting method and rests on a solid bronze frame that weighs 1750 kg (3760 lb). This statue is different from many other Elamite statues of women because it resembles male statues due to the wide belt on the dress and the patterns which closely resemble those on male statues.

The inscription on the side of the statue curses anyone, specifically men, who attempts to destroy the statue: &quot;I, Napir-Asu, wife of Untash-Napirisha. He who would seize my statue, who would smash it, who would destroy its inscription, who would erase my name, may he be smitten by the curse of Napirisha, of Kiririsha, and of Inshushinka, that his name shall become extinct, that his offspring be barren, that the forces of Beltiya, the great goddess, shall sweep down on him. This is Napir-Asu&#x27;s offering.&quot;

===Stele of Untash Napirisha===
The stele of the Elamite king, Untash-Napirisha was believed to have been commissioned in the 12th century BC. It was moved from the original religious capital of Chogha Zanbil to the city of Susa by the successor king, Shutruk-Nahnante. Four registers of the stele are left. The remains depict the god Inshushinak validating the legitimacy of who is thought to be Shutruk-Nahnante. In the periphery are two priestesses, deity hybrids of fish and women holding streams of water, and two half-man half-mouflon guardians of the sacred tree. The names of the two priestesses are carved on their arms.

King Untash Napirisha dedicated the stele to the god Ishushinak. Like other forms of art in the ancient Near East, this one portrays a king ceremonially recognizing a deity. This stele is unique in that the acknowledgement between king and god is reciprocal.

==Religion==
The Elamites practised polytheism. Due to scarcity of sources, past scholars assumed that Elamite religion must have been characterized by the &quot;ill-defined character of the individual gods and goddesses. ...Most of them were not only ineffable beings whose real name was either not uttered or was unknown, but also sublime ideas, not to be exactly defined by the human race.&quot; Worship also varied between localities. However, more recent scholarship shows that Elamite deities most likely were not any less defined than these of their Sumerian, Akkadian and Hurrian neighbors.

Inscriptions of many Elamite kings indicate that a concept of a supreme triad consisting of Inshushinak (originally the civic protector god of Susa, eventually the leader of the triad and guarantor of the monarchy), Kiririsha (an earth/mother goddess in southern Elam), and Napirisha existed. In the Neo-Elamite period Humban, previously a deity of limited relevance in known sources, emerged as a divine source of royal power.

Another significant deity was Pinikir, an astral goddess of love, similar to Ishtar. Some researchers, especially in the 1960s and 1970s, saw her as a mother goddess, and possibly originally chief deity, in northern Elam, later supplanted by or identified with Kiririsha, but this view is no longer supported by scholars.

There were also imported deities, such as Beltiya, Nergal or Nanaya; some native Elamite deities had Akkadian or Sumerian names as well (ex. Manzat, Inshushinak and his attendants), indicating a long history of interchange. Some Elamite deities were also venerated outside Elam: Pinikir was known to the Hurrians and Hittites, Simut appeared in Babylonian personal names, and an Assyrian text mentions Khumban, Napirisha and Yabru (Jabru) as protectors of the king.

=== List of Elamite gods ===
==Language==
Elamite is traditionally thought to be a language isolate, and completely unrelated to the neighbouring Semitic languages, Sumerian and Kassite, Hurrian (also isolates), and the later arriving Indo-European Iranian languages that came to dominate the region of Elam from the 6th century BC. It was written in a cuneiform adapted from the Semitic Akkadian script of Assyria and Babylonia, although the very earliest documents were written in the quite different &quot;Linear Elamite&quot; script. In 2006, two even older inscriptions in a similar script were discovered at Jiroft to the east of Elam, leading archaeologists to speculate that Linear Elamite had originally spread from further east to Susa. It seems to have developed from an even earlier writing known as &quot;proto-Elamite&quot;, but scholars are not unanimous on whether or not this script was used to write Elamite or another language, as it has not yet been deciphered. Several stages of the language are attested; the earliest date back to the third millennium BC, the latest to the Achaemenid Empire.

The Elamite language may have survived as late as the early Islamic period (roughly contemporary with the early medieval period in Europe). Among other Islamic medieval historians, Ibn al-Nadim, for instance, wrote that &quot;The Iranian languages are Fahlavi (Pahlavi), Dari (not to be confused with Dari Persian in modern Afghanistan), Khuzi, Persian and Suryani (Assyrian)&quot;, and Ibn Moqaffa noted that &quot;Khuzi&quot; was the unofficial language of the royalty of Persia, &quot;Khuz&quot; being the corrupted name for Elam.

===Suggested relations to other language families===
While Elamite is viewed as a language isolate by the vast majority of linguists, a minority of scholars have proposed that the Elamite language could be related to the Dravidian languages. David McAlpine believes Elamite may be related to the living Dravidian languages. This hypothesis (which has been subject to serious criticism by linguists) is considered under the rubric of Elamo-Dravidian languages.

==Legacy==
The Assyrians had utterly destroyed the Elamite nation, but new polities emerged in the area after Assyrian power faded. Among the nations that benefited from the decline of the Assyrians were the Iranian tribes, whose presence around Lake Urmia to the north of Elam is attested from the 9th century BC in Assyrian texts. Some time after that region fell to Madius the Scythian (653 BC), Teispes, son of Achaemenes, conquered Elamite Anshan in the mid 7th century BC, forming a nucleus that would expand into the Persian Empire. They were largely regarded as vassals of the Assyrians, and the Medes, Mannaeans, and Persians paid tribute to Assyria from the 10th century BC until the death of Ashurbanipal in 627 BC. After his death, the Medes played a major role in the destruction of the weakened Assyrian Empire in 612 BC.

The rise of the Achaemenids in the 6th century BC brought an end to the existence of Elam as an independent political power &quot;but not as a cultural entity&quot; (&quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;, Columbia University). Indigenous Elamite traditions, such as the use of the title &quot;king of Anshan&quot; by Cyrus the Great; the &quot;Elamite robe&quot; worn by Cambyses I of Anshan and seen on the famous winged genii at Pasargadae; some glyptic styles; the use of Elamite as the first of three official languages of the empire used in thousands of administrative texts found at Darius&#x27; city of Persepolis; the continued worship of Elamite deities; and the persistence of Elamite religious personnel and cults supported by the crown, formed an essential part of the newly emerging Achaemenid culture in Persian Iran. The Elamites thus became the conduit by which achievements of the Mesopotamian civilizations were introduced to the tribes of the Iranian plateau.

Conversely, remnants of Elamite had &quot;absorbed Iranian influences in both structure and vocabulary&quot; by 500 BC, suggesting a form of cultural continuity or fusion connecting the Elamite and the Persian periods.
Arab sources refer to speakers of &quot;Xūzī&quot; which was not &quot;Hebrew, Aramaic, or Persian&quot; spoken by servants and isolated rural communities in Khuzestan until the 10th century. Scholars such as &quot;von Spiegel, Huart, Spuler, Lazard, Potts, Orsatti, and Tavernier have already suggested or assumed that the language mentioned here is a very late form of Elamite.&quot;

The name of &quot;Elam&quot; survived into the Hellenistic period and beyond. In its Greek form, &quot;Elymais&quot;, it emerges as designating a semi-independent state under Parthian suzerainty during the 2nd century BC to the early 3rd century AD. In Acts 2:8–9 in the New Testament, the language of the &quot;Elamitēs&quot; is one of the languages heard at the Pentecost. From 410 onwards Elam (Beth Huzaye) was the senior metropolitan province of the Church of the East, surviving into the 14th century. Indian Carmelite historian John Marshal has proposed that the root of Carmelite history in the Indian subcontinent could be traced to the promise of restoration of Elam (Jeremiah 49:39).

In modern Iran, Ilam Province and Khuzestan Province are named after Elam civilization. Khuzestan means land of the Khuzis and Khuzi itself is a Middle Persian name for Elamites.

<text>Charles William King (5 September 1818 – 25 March 1888) was a British Victorian writer and collector of gems.

== Early life ==
King was born in Newport, Monmouthshire, and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1836. He graduated in 1840, and obtained a fellowship in 1842. He was a senior fellow by the time of his death in London. He took holy orders, but never held any parish position.

== Gem expert ==
King spent much time in Italy, where he laid the foundation of his collection of engraved gems and gemstones, which, having been increased by subsequent purchases in London, was sold by him in consequence of his failing eyesight, and was presented in 1881 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.

He was recognized universally as one of the greatest authorities in this department of art. His chief works on the subject are:
*&quot;Antique Gems, their Origin, Uses and Value&quot; (1860), a complete and exhaustive treatise
*&quot;The Natural History of Precious Stones and Gems and of the Precious Metals&quot; (1865)
*&quot;Early Christian Numismatics&quot; (1873)
*&quot;The Handbook of Engraved Gems&quot; (2nd ed., 1885)
*&quot;The Gnostics and their Remains&quot; (2nd ed. by J Jacobs, 1887, which led to an animated correspondence in the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;)

== Classicist ==
King was thoroughly familiar with the works of Greek and Latin authors, especially those of Pausanias and Pliny the Elder, which bore upon the subject in which he was most interested; but he had little taste for the minutiae of verbal criticism.
In 1869, he brought out an edition of &quot;Horace&quot;, illustrated from antique gems. He also translated Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Moralia&quot; (1882) and the theosophical works of the Emperor Julian (1888), for Bohn&#x27;s Classical Library.
==Death==
King died on 25 March 1888 and was buried in a family vault at Highgate Cemetery (east side).

<doc id="206485" wikidata="Q333294" url="?curid=206485" title="Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury">
<text>Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury (28 April 1801 – 1 October 1885), styled Lord Ashley from 1811 to 1851, was a British Tory politician, philanthropist, and social reformer. He was the eldest son of the 6th Earl of Shaftesbury and Lady Anne Spencer (daughter of the 4th Duke of Marlborough), and elder brother of Henry Ashley, MP. A social reformer who was called the &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Earl&quot;, he campaigned for better working conditions, reform to lunacy laws, education and the limitation of child labour. He was also an early supporter of the Zionist movement and the YMCA and a leading figure in the evangelical movement in the Church of England.

==Early life==
Lord Ashley, as he was styled until his father&#x27;s death in 1851, was educated at Manor House school in Chiswick, London (1812–1813), Harrow School (1813–1816) and Christ Church, Oxford, where he gained first-class honours in classics in 1822, took his MA in 1832 and was appointed DCL in 1841. Whilst at Oxford, he joined the Apollo University Lodge.

Ashley&#x27;s early family life was loveless, a circumstance common among the British upper classes. G. F. A. Best, in his biography &quot;Shaftesbury&quot;, writes that &quot;Ashley grew up without any experience of parental love. He saw little of his parents, and when duty or necessity compelled them to take notice of him they were formal and frightening.&quot; Even as an adult, he disliked his father and was known to refer to his mother as &quot;a devil&quot;.

This difficult childhood was softened by the affection he received from the family housekeeper Maria Millis, and his sisters. Millis provided for Ashley a model of Christian love that would form the basis for much of his later social activism and philanthropic work, as Best explains: &quot;What did touch him was the reality, and the homely practicality, of the love which her Christianity made her feel towards the unhappy child. She told him bible stories, she taught him a prayer.&quot; Despite this powerful reprieve, school became another source of misery for the young Ashley, whose education at Manor House from 1808 to 1813 introduced a &quot;more disgusting range of horrors&quot;. Shaftesbury himself shuddered to recall those years: &quot;The place was bad, wicked, filthy; and the treatment was starvation and cruelty.&quot;

By his teenage years Ashley had become a committed Christian, and whilst at Harrow he had two experiences which influenced his later life. &quot;Once, at the foot of Harrow Hill, he was the horrified witness of a pauper&#x27;s funeral. The drunken pallbearers, stumbling along with a crudely-made coffin and shouting snatches of bawdy songs, brought home to him the existence of a whole empire of callousness which put his own childhood miseries in their context. The second incident was his unusual choice of a subject for a Latin poem. In the school grounds, there was an unsavoury mosquito-breeding pond called the Duck Puddle. He chose it as his subject because he was urgently concerned that the school authorities should do something about it, and this appeared to be the simplest way of bringing it to their attention. Soon afterwards the Duck Puddle was inspected, condemned and filled in. This little triumph was a useful fillip to his self-confidence, but it was more than that. It was a foretaste of his skill in getting people to act decisively in face of sloth or immediate self-interest. This was to prove one of his greatest assets in Parliament.&quot;

==Political career==
Ashley was elected as the Tory Member of Parliament for Woodstock (at that time a pocket borough controlled by the Duke of Marlborough) in June 1826 and was a strong supporter of the Duke of Wellington. After George Canning replaced Lord Liverpool as Prime Minister, he offered Ashley a place in the new government, despite Ashley having been in the Commons for only five months. Ashley politely declined, writing in his diary that he believed that serving under Canning would be a betrayal of his allegiance to the Duke of Wellington and that he was not qualified for office. Before he had completed one year in the Commons, he had been appointed to three parliamentary committees and he received his fourth such appointment in June 1827, when he was appointed to the Select Committee on Pauper Lunatics in the County of Middlesex and on Lunatic Asylums.

===Reform of the Lunacy laws===
In 1827, when Ashley-Cooper was appointed to the Select Committee on Pauper Lunatics in the County of Middlesex and on Lunatic Asylums, the majority of lunatics in London were kept in madhouses owned by Dr Warburton. The Committee examined many witnesses concerning one of his madhouses in Bethnal Green, called the White House. Ashley visited this on the committee&#x27;s behalf. The patients were chained up, slept naked on straw, and excreted in their beds. They were left chained from Saturday afternoon until Monday morning when they were cleared of the accumulated excrement. They were then washed down in freezing cold water and one towel was allotted to 160 people, with no soap. It was overcrowded, and the meat provided was &quot;that nasty thick hard muscle a dog could not eat&quot;. The White House had been described as &quot;a mere place for dying&quot; rather than curing the insane and when the Committee asked Dr MacMichael whether he believed that &quot;in the lunatic asylums in the neighbourhood of London any curative process is going on with regard to pauper patients&quot;, he replied: &quot;None at all&quot;.

The Committee recommended that &quot;legislative measures of a remedial character should be introduced at the earliest period at the next session&quot;, and the establishment of a Board of Commissioners appointed by the Home Secretary possessing extensive powers of licensing, inspection and control. When in February 1828 Robert Gordon, Liberal MP for Cricklade, introduced a bill to put these recommendations into law, Ashley seconded this and delivered his maiden speech in support of the Bill. He wrote in his diary: &quot;So, by God&#x27;s blessing, my first effort has been for the advance of human happiness. May I improve hourly! Fright almost deprived me of recollection but again thank Heaven, I did not sit down quite a presumptuous idiot&quot;. Ashley was also involved in framing the County Lunatic Asylums (England) Act 1828 and the Madhouses Act 1828. Through these Acts, fifteen commissioners were appointed for the London area and given extensive powers of licensing and inspection, one of the commissioners being Ashley.

In July 1845, Ashley sponsored two Lunacy Acts, &#x27;For the Regulation of lunatic Asylums&#x27; and &#x27;For the better Care and Treatment of Lunatics in England and Wales&#x27;. They originated in the Report of the Commissioners in Lunacy which he had commended to Parliament the year before. These Acts consolidated and amended previous lunacy laws, providing better record keeping and more strict certification regulations to ensure patients against unwarranted detention. They also ordered, instead of merely permitting, the construction of country lunatic asylums and establishing an ongoing Lunacy Commission with Ashley as its chairman. In support of these measures, Ashley gave a speech in which he claimed that although since 1828 there had been an improvement, more still needed to be done. He cited the case of a Welsh lunatic girl, Mary Jones, who had for more than a decade been locked in a tiny loft with one boarded-up window with little air and no light. The room was extremely filthy and filled with an intolerable smell. She could only squat in a bent position in the room and this had caused her to become deformed.

In early 1858, a Select Committee was appointed over concerns that sane persons were detained in lunatic asylums. Lord Shaftesbury (as Ashley had become upon his father&#x27;s death in 1851) was the chief witness and opposed the suggestion that the certification of insanity be made more difficult and that early treatment of insanity was essential if there was to be any prospect of a cure. He claimed that only one or two people in his time dealing with lunacy had been detained in an asylum without sufficient grounds and that commissioners should be granted more not fewer powers. The committee&#x27;s Report endorsed all of Shaftesbury&#x27;s recommendations except for one: that a magistrate&#x27;s signature on a certificate of lunacy be made compulsory. This was not put into law chiefly due to Shaftesbury&#x27;s opposition to it. The Report also agreed with Shaftesbury that unwarranted detentions were &quot;extremely rare&quot;.

In July 1877, Shaftesbury gave evidence before the Select Committee on the Lunacy Laws, which had been appointed in February over concerns that it was too easy for sane persons to be detained in asylums. Shaftesbury feared that because of his advanced age he would be taken over by forgetfulness whilst giving evidence and was greatly stressed in the months leading up to this: &quot;Shall fifty years of toil, anxiety and prayer, crowned by marvellous and unlooked-for success, bring me in the end only sorrow and disgrace?&quot; When &quot;the hour of trial&quot; arrived Shaftesbury defended the Lunacy Commission and claimed he was now the only person alive who could speak with personal knowledge of the state of care of lunatics before the Lunacy Commission was established in 1828. It had been &quot;a state of things such as would pass all belief&quot;. In the committee&#x27;s Report, the members of the Committee agreed with Shaftesbury&#x27;s evidence on all points.

In 1884, the husband of Mrs Georgina Weldon tried to have her detained in a lunatic asylum because she believed that her pug dog had a soul and that the spirit of her dead mother had entered into her pet rabbit. She commenced legal action against Shaftesbury and other lunacy commissioners although it failed. In May, Shaftesbury spoke in the Lords against a motion declaring the lunacy laws unsatisfactory but the motion passed Parliament. The Lord Chancellor Selborne supported a Lunacy Law Amendment Bill and Shaftesbury wanted to resign from the Lunacy Commission as he believed he was honour bound not to oppose a Bill supported by the Lord Chancellor. However, Selborne implored him not to resign so Shaftesbury refrained. However, when the Bill was introduced and it contained the provision which made it compulsory for a certificate of lunacy to be signed by a magistrate or a judge, he resigned. The government fell, however, and the Bill was withdrawn and Shaftesbury resumed his chairmanship of the Lunacy Commission.

Shaftesbury&#x27;s work in improving the care of the insane remains one of his most important, though lesser known, achievements. He wrote: &quot;Beyond the circle of my own Commissioners and the lunatics that I visit, not a soul, in great or small life, not even my associates in my works of philanthropy, has any notion of the years of toil and care that, under God, I have bestowed on this melancholy and awful question&quot;.

===Child labour===
In March 1833, Ashley introduced the Ten Hours Act 1833 into the Commons, which provided that children working in the cotton and woollen industries must be aged nine or above; no person under the age of eighteen was to work more than ten hours a day or eight hours on a Saturday; and no one under twenty-five was to work nights, insisted they should go to school, and appointed inspectors to enforce the law. However the Whig government, by a majority of 145, amended this to substitute &quot;thirteen&quot; in place of &quot;eighteen&quot; and the Act as it passed ensured that no child under thirteen worked more than nine hours.

In June 1836, another Ten Hours act was introduced into the Commons and although Ashley considered this Bill ill-timed, he supported it. In July one member of the Lancashire committees set up to support the Bill wrote that: &quot;If there was one man in England more devoted to the interests of the factory people than another, it was Lord Ashley. They might always rely on him as a ready, steadfast and willing friend&quot;. In July 1837, he accused the government of ignoring the breaches of the 1833 Act and moved the resolution that the House regretted the regulation of the working hours of children had been found to be unsatisfactory. It was lost by fifteen votes.

The text of &quot;A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings of William Dodd a Factory Cripple&quot; was sent to Lord Ashley and with his support was published in 1840. Ashley employed William Dodd at 45 shillings a week, and he wrote &quot;The Factory System: Illustrated&quot; to describe the conditions of working children in textile manufacture. This was published in 1842. These books were attacked by John Bright in parliament who said that he had evidence that the books described Dodd&#x27;s mistreatment but were in fact driven by Dodd&#x27;s ingratitude as a disgruntled employee. Ashley sacked Dodd who emigrated to America.

In 1842, Ashley wrote twice to the Prime Minister, Robert Peel, to urge the government to support a new Factory Act. Peel wrote in reply that he would not support one, and Ashley wrote to the Short Time Committees of Cheshire, Lancashire and Yorkshire who desired a Ten Hours Act:
In March 1844, Ashley moved an amendment to a Factory Bill limiting the working hours of adolescents to ten hours after Sir James Graham had introduced a Bill aiming to limit their working hours to twelve hours. Ashley&#x27;s amendment was passed by eight votes, the first time the Commons had approved of the Ten Hour principle. However, in a later vote, his amendment was defeated by seven votes and the Bill was withdrawn. Later that month, Graham introduced another Bill which again would limit the employment of adolescents to twelve hours. Ashley supported this Bill except that he wanted ten hours not twelve as the limit. In May he moved an amendment to limit the hours worked to ten hours but this was lost by 138 votes.

In 1846, whilst he was out of Parliament, Ashley strongly supported John Fielden&#x27;s Ten Hours Bill, which was lost by ten votes. In January 1847, Fielden reintroduced his Bill and it finally passed through Parliament to become the Ten Hours Act.

====Miners====
Ashley introduced the Mines and Collieries Act 1842 in Parliament to outlaw the employment of women and children underground in coal mines. He made a speech in support of the Act and the Prince Consort wrote to him afterwards, sending him the &quot;best wishes for your &quot;total&quot; success&quot;. At the end of his speech, his opponent on the Ten Hours issue, Richard Cobden, walked over to Ashley and said: &quot;You know how opposed I have been to your views, but I don&#x27;t think I have ever been put into such a frame of mind in the whole course of my life as I have been by your speech.&quot;

====Climbing boys====
Ashley was a strong supporter of prohibiting the employment of boys as chimney sweeps. Many climbing boys were illegitimate who had been sold by their parents. They had scorched and lacerated skin, their eyes and throats filled with soot, with the danger of suffocation and their occupational disease—cancer of the scrotum. In 1840, a Bill was introduced into the Commons outlawing the employment of boys as chimney sweeps, and strongly supported by Ashley. Despite being enforced in London, elsewhere the Act did not stop the employment of child chimney sweeps and this led to the foundation of the Climbing-Boys&#x27; Society with Ashley as its chairman. In 1851, 1853 and 1855, Shaftesbury introduced Bills into Parliament to deal with the ongoing use of boy chimney sweeps but these were all defeated. He succeeded in passing the Chimney Sweepers Regulation Act 1864 but, like its predecessors, it remained ineffectual. Shaftesbury finally persuaded Parliament to pass the Chimney Sweepers Act 1875 which ensured the annual licensing of chimney sweeps and the enforcement of the law by the police. This finally eradicated the employment of boys as chimney sweeps.

After Shaftesbury discovered that a boy chimney sweep was living behind his house in Brock Street, London, he rescued the child and sent him to &quot;the Union School at Norwood Hill, where, under God&#x27;s blessing and special merciful grace, he will be trained in the knowledge and love and faith of our common Saviour&quot;.

====Education reform====
In 1844, Ashley became president of the Ragged School Union that promoted ragged schools. These schools were for poor children and sprang up from volunteers. Ashley wrote that &quot;If the Ragged School system were to fail I should not die in the course of nature, I should die of a broken heart&quot;.

====Housing reform====
In 1851 two acts were passed at Shaftesbury&#x27;s insistence concerning lodging houses. This marked, according to one study, &quot;the first attempt of the legislature to grapple with the question of unhealthy dwellings.&quot; The Common Lodging Houses Act 1851, which Charles Dickens described as &#x27;the best measure ever passed in Parliament,&#x27; provided for all such lodging houses to be registered and &quot;that no lodgers were to be kept until the houses had been inspected and opened by an officer of the local authority.&quot; In addition, local authorities were given the power to make regulations for common-lodging houses and exact penalties for regulation breaches. Regular cleansing and whitewashing were enforced while it was rendered compulsory &quot;for the keeper of a lodging-house to give immediate notice of any case of fever or infectious disease in the house to the local authority, to the Poor Law medical officer and the relieving officer.&quot; The Labouring Classes Lodging Houses Act 1851 &quot;empowered borough councils and local boards to erect lodging-houses or to purchase existing lodging-houses, and to manage them, making by-laws for charges, management, etc. Such lodging-houses were under the inspection of the local boards of health.&quot;

====Animal welfare====

Shaftesbury advocated for animal welfare and was president of the Victoria Street Society for the Protection of Animals from Vivisection.
He was also a vice-president of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. He argued for total abolition of vivisection, not reform. In 1879, he delivered a speech condemning the practice of vivisection and questioned why vivisectionists were subjecting &quot;God&#x27;s creatures to such unspeakable sufferings?&quot;.

===Religious restoration===

==== Zionist movement ====

Shaftesbury was a pre-millennial evangelical Anglican who believed in the imminent second coming of Christ. His belief underscored the urgency of immediate action. He strongly opposed Roman Catholic Church ritualism among High Church Anglicans. He also disapproved of the Catholic features of the Oxford Movement in the Church of England. He denounced the Maynooth College Act 1845, which funded the Catholic seminary in Ireland that would train many priests. However, disagreeing with his father, he favored Catholic Emancipation.
Shaftesbury was a leading figure within 19th-century evangelical Anglicanism. Shaftesbury was President of the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) from 1851 until his death in 1885. He wrote, of the Bible Society, &quot;Of all Societies, this is nearest to my heart... Bible Society has always been a watchword in our house.&quot; He was also president of the Evangelical Alliance for some time.

Shaftesbury was also a student of Edward Bickersteth and the two men became prominent advocates of Christian Zionism in Britain. Shaftesbury was an early proponent of the Restoration of the Jews to the Holy Land, providing the first proposal by a major politician to resettle Jews in Palestine. The conquest of the region of Syria in 1831 by Muhammad Ali of Egypt changed the conditions under which European power politics operated in the Near East. As a consequence of that shift, Shaftesbury was able to help persuade Foreign Minister Palmerston to send a British consul, James Finn, to Jerusalem in 1838. A committed Christian and a loyal Englishman, Shaftesbury argued for a Jewish return because of what he saw as the political and economic advantages Britain would gain from this and because he believed that it was God&#x27;s will. In January 1839, Shaftesbury published an article in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, which although initially commenting on the 1838 &quot;Letters on Egypt, Edom and the Holy Land (1838)&quot; by Lord Lindsay, provided the first proposal by a major politician to resettle Jews in Palestine: In 1848, Shaftesbury became president of the London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews, of which Finn was a prominent member.

The lead-up to the Crimean War (1854), like the military expansionism of Muhammad Ali two decades earlier, signalled an opening for realignments in the Near East. In July 1853, Shaftesbury wrote to the Prime Minister, Lord Aberdeen, that Greater Syria was &quot;a country without a nation&quot; in need of &quot;a nation without a country... Is there such a thing? To be sure there is, the ancient and rightful lords of the soil, the Jews!&quot; In his diary that year he wrote &quot;these vast and fertile regions will soon be without a ruler, without a known and acknowledged power to claim dominion. The territory must be assigned to some one or other... There is a country without a nation; and God now in his wisdom and mercy, directs us to a nation without a country.&quot; This is commonly cited as an early use of the phrase &quot;A land without a people for a people without a land&quot; by which Shaftesbury was echoing another British proponent of the restoration of the Jews to Palestine, Dr Alexander Keith.

===Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade===
Shaftesbury served as the first president of the Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade: a lobbying group dedicated to the abolition of the opium trade. The Society was formed by Quaker businessmen in 1874, and Shaftesbury was president from 1880 until his death. The Society&#x27;s efforts eventually led to the creation of the investigative Royal Commission on Opium.

==Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain==
The Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain in Piccadilly Circus, London, erected in 1893, was designed to commemorate his philanthropic works. The fountain is crowned by Alfred Gilbert&#x27;s aluminium statue of Anteros as a nude, butterfly-winged archer. This is officially titled The Angel of Christian Charity, but has become popularly if mistakenly known as &quot;Eros&quot;. It appears on the masthead of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;.

==Veneration==
Lord Shaftesbury was a member of the Canterbury Association, as were two of Wilberforce&#x27;s sons, Samuel and Robert. Lord Ashley joined on 27 March 1848.

Anthony Ashley Cooper is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 1 October.

==Family==

Lord Shaftesbury, then Lord Ashley, married Lady Emily Caroline Catherine Frances Cowper (died 15 October 1872), daughter of Peter Cowper, 5th Earl Cowper and Emily Lamb, Countess Cowper; Emily is likely in fact to have been the natural daughter of Lord Palmerston (later her official stepfather), on 10 June 1830. This marriage, which proved a happy and fruitful one, produced ten children. It also provided invaluable political connections for Ashley; his wife&#x27;s maternal uncle was Lord Melbourne and her stepfather (and supposed biological father) Lord Palmerston, both prime ministers.

The children, who mostly had various degrees of ill-health, were:
#Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 8th Earl of Shaftesbury (27 June 1831 – 13 April 1886), ancestor of all subsequent earls. He proved to be a disappointing heir apparent, constantly running up debts with his extravagant wife Harriet, born Lady Harriet Chichester.
#(Anthony) Francis Henry Ashley-Cooper, second son (b. 13 March 1833 – 13 May 1849)
#(Anthony) Maurice William Ashley-Cooper, third son (22 July 1835 – 19 August 1855), died aged 20, after several years of illness. 
#(Anthony) Evelyn Melbourne Ashley (24 July 1836 – 15 November 1907), married firstly 28 July 1866 Sybella Charlotte Farquhar ( – 31 August 1886), daughter of Sir Walter Farquhar, 3rd Baronet by his wife Lady Mary Octavia Somerset, a daughter of the Duke of Beaufort and had one son Wilfred William Ashley, and one daughter. His granddaughter was Edwina Ashley, later Lady Mountbatten (1901–1960), who had two daughters Patricia, Countess Mountbatten of Burma (1924-2017) and Lady Pamela Hicks (b. 1929). Evelyn Ashley left several other descendants via his daughter and Edwina&#x27;s younger sister. Evelyn Ashley married 2ndly 30 June 1891 Lady Alice Elizabeth Cole (4 February 1853 – 25 August 1931), daughter of William Willoughby Cole, 3rd Earl of Enniskillen by his first wife Jane Casamajor, no issue. Evelyn Melbourne Ashley died on 15 November 1907.
#Lady Victoria Elizabeth Ashley, later Lady Templemore (23 September 1837 – 15 February 1927), married 8 January 1873 (aged 35) St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, London Harry Chichester, 2nd Baron Templemore (4 June 1821 – 10 June 1906), son of Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Templemore and Lady Augusta Paget, and had issue.
#(Anthony) Lionel George Ashley-Cooper (b. 7 September 1838 – 1914). He married 12 December 1868 Frances Elizabeth Leigh &quot;Fanny (d. 12 August 1875), daughter of Capel Hanbury Leigh; apparently had no issue.
#Lady Mary Charlotte Ashley-Cooper, second daughter (25 July 1842 – 3 September 1861).
#Lady Constance Emily Ashley-Cooper, third daughter, or &quot;Conty&quot; (29 November 1845 – 16 December 1872 or 1871 of lung disease).
#Lady Edith Florence Ashley-Cooper, fourth daughter (1 February 1847 – 25 November 1913)
#(Anthony) Cecil Ashley-Cooper, sixth son and tenth and youngest child (8 August 1849 – 23 September 1932); apparently died unmarried.

==Legacy==
Although he was offered a burial at Westminster Abbey, Shaftesbury wished to be buried at St. Giles. George Williams (YMCA) chaired the organising committee of his funeral, and was a pall-bearer at it. A funeral service was held in Westminster Abbey during the early morning of 8 October and the streets along the route from Grosvenor Square and Westminster Abbey were thronged with poor people, costermongers, flower-girls, boot-blacks, crossing-sweepers, factory-hands and similar workers who waited for hours to see Shaftesbury&#x27;s coffin as it passed by. Due to his constant advocacy for the better treatment of the working classes, Shaftesbury became known as the &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Earl&quot;. A white marble statue commemorates Shaftesbury near the west door of Westminster Abbey.

One of his biographers, Georgina Battiscombe, has claimed that &quot;No man has in fact ever done more to lessen the extent of human misery or to add to the sum total of human happiness&quot;.

Three days after his death, Charles Spurgeon eulogised him, saying:

<text>Garsington Manor, in the village of Garsington, near Oxford, England, is a country house, dating from the 17th century. Its fame derives principally from its owner in the early 20th century, the &quot;legendary Ottoline Morrell, who held court from 1915 to 1924&quot;. 

Members of the Bloomsbury Group, the aristocratic Ottoline, and her wealthy husband Philip, were friends with an array of artists, writers and intellectuals, D. H. Lawrence, T. S. Eliot, E. M. Forster, Bertrand Russell, Aldous Huxley, Virginia Woolf ,Siegfried Sassoon, Stanley and Gilbert Spencer being among the visitors to their house. The manor was later owned by Leonard Ingrams and from 1989 to 2010 was the setting for an annual summer opera season, the Garsington Opera, which relocated to Wormsley Park in 2011. Garsington is a Grade II* listed building.

==History==
The manor house was built on land once owned by the son of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer, and at one time had the name &quot;Chaucers&quot;. It was constructed in the 1630s by a William Wyckham. Lady Ottoline and her husband, Philip Morrell, bought the manor house in 1913, at which time it was in a state of disrepair, having been in use as a farmhouse. They paid £8,450. Their moving in was delayed until May 1915, due to the continuing occupancy by the former tenants.

Garsington became a haven for the Morrells’ friends, including D. H. Lawrence, Siegfried Sassoon, Edward Sackville-West, Lord David Cecil, Lytton Strachey, Aldous Huxley, Mark Gertler, Bertrand Russell, Virginia Woolf, T. S. Eliot, E. M. Forster and Walter de la Mare. In 1916, they invited conscientious objectors, including Clive Bell and other members of the Bloomsbury Group, to come and work on the home farm for the duration of World War I, as civilian work classified as being of national importance was recognised as an alternative to military service. 

Aldous Huxley spent some time at Garsington before he wrote &quot;Crome Yellow&quot;, a book which contains a caricature based on Ottoline for which she never forgave him. His pen portrait of her, written after their first meeting in 1915, summarises the aspects of her character which both attracted and repelled; &quot;[She] is quite an incredible creature - arty beyond the dreams of avarice and a patroness of literature and the modern. She is intelligent, but her affectation is overwhelming&quot;. Huxley was not the only one of Ottoline&#x27;s friends to mock her in print. Her affair with a stonemason Lionel Gomme, known as &quot;Tiger&quot;, who worked on the statuary at Garsington, has been cited by some critics as the basis for Lawrence&#x27;s portrayal of Lady Chatterley&#x27;s affair with the gamekeeper, Mellors in his novel of 1928. Lawrence portrayed her even more directly as Lady Hermione Roddice, in his novel &quot;Women in Love&quot;. The savagery of the depiction caused a decades-long breach in their friendship, and Philip Morrell threatened to sue Lawrence&#x27;s publishers.

&quot;In Confidence&quot;, a short story by Katherine Mansfield, portrays the &quot;wits of Garsington&quot; some four years before &quot;Crome Yellow&quot;. Not everyone found the atmosphere congenial; the shy poet Cecil Day-Lewis, taken to Garsington by his tutor Maurice Bowra, found it &quot;a tremendous ordeal&quot; and sought refuge &quot;slinking gloomily amongst the peacocks&quot; in the Italianate gardens. Lytton Strachey complained that the constant coming and going of guests made work impossible: &quot;I sit quivering among a surging mesh of pugs, peacocks, pianolas, and humans - if humans they can be called - the inhabitants of Circe&#x27;s cave&quot;. David Garnett, a writer, and lover of a number of Ottoline&#x27;s guests, recorded his impressions of Garsington in his autobiography; &quot;Ottoline&#x27;s pack of pug dogs trotted everywhere and added to the Beardsley quality, which was one half of her natural taste. The characteristic of every house in which Ottoline lived was its smell and the smell of Garsington was stronger than that of Bedford Square. It reeked of the bowls of potpourri and orris root which stood on every mantelpiece, side table and window-sill and of the desiccated oranges, studded with cloves, which Ottoline loved making&quot;.

The Morrells restored the house in the 1920s, working with the architect Philip Tilden, and creating landscaped Italian-style gardens. The parterre has 24 square beds with Irish yews at the corners; the Italian garden has a large ornamental pool enclosed by yew hedges and set with statues. This was designed by Charles Edward Mallows; beyond, is a wild garden, with lime-tree avenues, shrubs, a stream and pond. Financial difficulties forced the Morrells to sell Garsington in 1928. The house was subsequently bought by Sir John Wheeler-Bennett, the historian, who lived there until his death in 1975. It was sold in 1981 to Leonard Ingrams, a banker and brother of Richard. Following Leonard Ingrams&#x27; death in 2012, the house was again sold.

==Architecture and description==
The house is a rectangular structure, of two storeys with attics. The building material is limestone rubble. In his memoirs, &quot;True Remembrances-the memoirs of an architect&quot;, Philip Tilden recorded the unobtrusive style he sought to achieve at Garsington; &quot;I doubt whether the present-day visitor could spot these alterations, they were made out of odd bits, and the workmanship was carried out by men of the old school&quot;.

Garsington is a Grade II* listed building, and its gardens are also grade II* on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. A number of other buildings on the estate, and landscaping features in the gardens have Grade II listings including the stables, the bakehouse, the gates at the forecourt to the manor, the pool, a summer house and statuary and an 18th-century dovecote.

<text>Garsington is a village and civil parish about southeast of Oxford in Oxfordshire. &quot;A History of the County of Oxfordshire&quot; provides a detailed history of the parish from 1082. The 2011 census recorded the parish&#x27;s population as 1,689. 

The village is known for the artistic colony and flamboyant social life of the Bloomsbury Group at Garsington Manor when it was the home from 1914 to 1928 of Philip and Ottoline Morrell, and for the Garsington Opera which was staged there from 1989 to 2010.

==Buildings==
===Garsington Manor===

Garsington Manor in Southend was built in the 16th century and remodelled in the 17th century. It is a Grade II* listed building. It was the home of Lady Ottoline Morrell (1873–1938), doyenne of the Bloomsbury group of writers and artists who used to meet at the manor. These included the philosopher Bertrand Russell, the writers Aldous Huxley, W. B. Yeats, Virginia Woolf and D. H. Lawrence and the artists Mark Gertler, Eric Gill and Dora Carrington. Garsington Manor was bought in 1982 by Leonard Ingrams who established the Garsington Opera, an annual open air opera festival which was staged there each summer from 1989 until 2010. The opera moved to Wormsley Park, Buckinghamshire in 2011.

===Parish church===
The oldest part of the parish church of Saint Mary includes the tower, built towards the end of the 12th century in the transitional style between Norman and Early English. The chancel is pure Early English and was built or rebuilt in about 1300. St Mary&#x27;s has Decorated Gothic north and south aisles, which were added in the 14th century and have four-bay arcades. St Mary&#x27;s was restored in 1849 under the direction of the Gothic Revival architect Joseph Clarke. Clarke&#x27;s alterations included rebuilding the chancel arch to match the north arcade, adding gargoyles to the south aisle and much remodelling of the north aisle. St Mary&#x27;s is a Grade II* listed building. Inside, next to the entrance door, is a memorial to Garsington&#x27;s most illustrious inhabitant, Ottoline Morrell, by Eric Gill.

The west tower has a ring of six bells. Richard Keene of Woodstock cast the treble bell in 1696. Abraham II Rudhall of Gloucester cast the second bell in 1720. Henry III Bagley of Chacombe, Northamptonshire cast the third bell in 1733, presumably at his then foundry in Witney. John Rudhall of Gloucester cast the tenor bell in 1788. W&amp;J Taylor cast the fifth bell in 1825, presumably at their then foundry in Oxford. The fourth bell was cast in 1732 but Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry recast it in 1929. The bells were restored in 2013. Thomas Thwaites of Clerkenwell in London built the turret clock for the tower in 1796 at a cost of £172 4s 0d. It is a 30-hour clock and it strikes the hours on the tenor bell. Its dials still have only an hour hand.

St Mary&#x27;s parish is now part of the Benefice of Garsington, Cuddesdon and Horspath.

The wedding scene in the 2006 film &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; was filmed at the church.

===School===
A parish school was built in Garsington in 1840. It was reorganised as a junior school in 1923. It now occupies more modern premises and is a Church of England primary school.

===Village hall===
The village hall was built in 1911 and given to the village by Philip Morrell. For most of the 20th century it served the needs of the villagers and a number of small improvements were made over the years. It was recently renovated to bring it up to modern day standards. The building retains its original appearance as well as adding modern-day facilities.

==Amenities==
Garsington has a public house: the Three Horseshoes, with the Red Lion and the Plough having closed. 

Garsington Sports and Social Club is in Denton Lane. It has two men&#x27;s football teams that play in the Oxfordshire Senior Football League and two youth teams that play in the &quot;Oxford Mail&quot; Youth League Garsington Cricket Club plays in the Oxfordshire Cricket Association League Division Five. 

The Garsington Society seeks to expand the knowledge of the history and geography of Garsington and its surrounding areas, and organises talks, walks, and social events. 

Garsington has a Women&#x27;s Institute. 

The most recent dramatic production by the Garsington Players was Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot; in July 2023.

The village has an exceptionally rich network of footpaths and bridleways which are maintained by local volunteers. This includes a section of the Oxford Green Belt way.

The &quot;city11&quot; bus service connects Garsington to Oxford and Watlington. There has never been a railway station. Nearby stations include Oxford, Didcot Parkway, and Thame and Haddenham Parkway.

==Residents==
In addition to the Bloomsbury Group and the Garsington Opera residents have included historians John Wheeler-Bennett, Raymond Dawson and Russell Meiggs, writers Rider Haggard, Adrian Townsend, Howard Marks and Janet Bolam, surgeon Edgar Somerville, medical scientists Paul Bolam, John Hall and Philip Cowen, and mathematician Roger Heath-Brown.

<doc id="206489" wikidata="Q4219395" url="?curid=206489" title="Benjamin Hall Kennedy">
<text>Benjamin Hall Kennedy (6 November 1804 – 6 April 1889) was an English scholar and schoolmaster, known for his work in the teaching of the Latin language. He was an active supporter of Newnham College and Girton College as Cambridge University colleges for women.

==Biography==
He was born at Summer Hill, near Birmingham, the eldest son of Rann Kennedy (1772–1851), of a branch of the Ayrshire family which had settled in Staffordshire. Rann was a scholar and man of letters, several of whose sons rose to distinction. Benjamin was educated at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham, Shrewsbury School, and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He took frequent part in Cambridge Union debates and became president in 1825. In 1824 he was elected a member of the Cambridge Conversazione Society, better known as the Cambridge Apostles, and was a winner of a Browne medal. He was elected Fellow and lecturer in Classics at St John&#x27;s College in 1828 and took Holy Orders the following year. In 1830, he became an assistant master at Harrow.

In 1836, he, his wife and his first child Charlotte Amy May Kennedy returned to Shrewsbury when he became headmaster. While they were there Charlotte was joined by Marion, Julia, Edith and Arthur. In 1841 he became prebendary of Lichfield, and after leaving Shrewsbury he was rector of West Felton, Shropshire, from 1866 to 1868. He remained as headmaster of Shrewsbury School until 1866, the 30 years being marked by successes for his pupils, chiefly in Classics. When he retired, a large collection was made, and this was used on new school buildings and on founding a Latin professorship at Cambridge. The first holders of the Kennedy Professor of Latin chair were both former pupils of Kennedy, H. A. J. Munro and J. E. B. Mayor.

In 1867, Kennedy was elected Regius Professor of Greek at Cambridge and canon of Ely Cathedral, serving in both posts until his death.
From 1870 to 1880 he was a member of the committee for the revision of the New Testament. In 1870 he also became a member of the University Council.

He supported the access of women to university education and took a prominent part in the establishment of Newnham and Girton colleges. When Mary Paley and Amy Bulley were among the first women to take tripos examinations they did it in the Kennedys&#x27; drawing room. Paley described him as excitable, but he would sometimes doze whilst nominally invigilating. He was nicknamed &quot;the purple boy&quot;. In politics, he had liberal sympathies. He died near Torquay and is buried in Mill Road Cemetery, Cambridge.

F. D. How included Kennedy in the 1904 book &quot;Six Great Schoolmasters&quot;.

==Writings==
Kennedy wrote a number of classical and theological works, but he is most famous today for his primer of Latin grammar. This began as the &quot;Elementary Latin Primer&quot; (1843), which became the &quot;Public School Latin Primer&quot; (1866), the &quot;Public School Latin Grammar&quot; (1871), and finally the &quot;Revised Latin Primer&quot; (1888). The latter was further revised by J. F. Mountford in 1930. Another revision was edited by Gerrish Gray (first edition, 2008; second edition 2019), one version for a US audience and another for a UK audience. The medieval way of writing Latin noun tables, starting with the nominative and then proceeding to the genitive was used in England prior to Kennedy&#x27;s Primer and is still widely used in America (e.g. in the Wheelock&#x27;s Latin course). Kennedy changed the order of writing the noun endings so that the nominative was always followed by the vocative and accusative, in order to bring out more effectively the similarities between these cases in many nouns. Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;Primer&quot; was so widely used and was so influential that this led to a permanent change in the way that Latin is taught in the UK. Modern books such as the &quot;Cambridge Latin Course&quot; still follow this approach.

In 1913, there was a problem with the copyright on the &quot;Revised Latin Primer&quot; which had been published in 1888. His daughter Marion Kennedy, a Latin scholar, revealed that the book was written by herself, her sister Julia and two of her father&#x27;s former students, G. H. Hallam and T. E. Page. It is unlikely that Kennedy had any hand in the revision of 1888, and the &quot;Shorter Latin Primer&quot; of the same year. The BBC Radio 4 programme in December 2018 &quot;Amo, Amas, Amusical&quot;, presented by Mary Beard, explained the background to the primer and the sisters&#x27; significant part in writing it, as well as the resistance to women&#x27;s higher education at Cambridge and elsewhere during their lifetime.

Other works include:
*&quot;Christian Peaceableness: a Sermon&quot; (1839)
*&quot;An Elementary Grammar of the Latin Language&quot; (1847)
*&quot;Palaestra Latina; or, A Second Latin Reading-Book&quot; (1850)
*&quot;The Psalter in English Verse&quot; (1860)
*&quot;Elementary Greek Grammar&quot; (1862)
*&quot;The Public School Latin Grammar&quot; (1871; 4th ed., 1876)
*&quot;Studia Sophoclea, ... Being a Critical Examination of Lewis Campbell&#x27;s edition of Sophocles&quot; (1874)
*Sophocles, &quot;Oedipus Tyrannus&quot; (2nd ed., 1885)
*Aristophanes, &quot;Birds&quot; (1874)
*Aeschylus, &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, with introduction, metrical translation and notes (2nd ed., 1882)
*A commentary on Virgil (3rd ed., 1881)
*Plato, &quot;Theaetetus&quot;, English translation (1881)

He contributed largely to the collection known as &quot;Sabrinae Corolla&quot; (John Bell, London, 1850), and published a collection of verse in Greek, Latin and English under the title of &quot;Between Whiles&quot; (2nd ed., 1882), with many autobiographical details.

==Family==
His brother Charles Rann Kennedy was a barrister and wrote original works as well as translating and editing classical works. His younger brother The Rev. William James Kennedy (1814-1891) was a prominent educator, and the father of Lord Justice Sir William Rann Kennedy (1846–1915), a distinguished Cambridge scholar.

<doc id="206490" wikidata="Q832054" url="?curid=206490" title="Hey Arnold!">
<text>Hey Arnold! is an American animated sitcom created by Craig Bartlett for Nickelodeon. It originally aired from October 7, 1996, to June 8, 2004. The show centers on fourth grader Arnold Shortman, who lives with his grandparents in an inner-city tenement in the fictional city of Hillwood. Episodes center on his experiences navigating urban life while dealing with the zany hijinks he and his friends encounter. Many episodes, however, focus on other characters, including major, secondary, supporting, and even minor characters.

Bartlett&#x27;s idea for the show is based on a minor character named Arnold who he created while working on &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;. The executives enjoyed the character, and Bartlett completed the cast and setting by drawing inspiration from people and locations he grew up with in Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; and Brooklyn, New York. Bartlett created the pilot episode in his living room in 1994 and official production began in 1995. The animators worked to transform Arnold from clay animation to cel animation, leading to the series premiere in 1996. &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; was the final series to be green lit (along with &quot;Kablam!&quot;) under the leadership of network president Geraldine Laybourne. Production on the show concluded on December 7, 2001, after 5 seasons and 100 episodes. Its last episode aired unannounced on June 8, 2004. A feature film based on the series, &quot;Hey Arnold!: The Movie&quot;, was released in theaters on June 28, 2002. All five seasons have been released on DVD.

On March 2, 2016, a television film continuation of the series, &quot;Hey Arnold!: The Jungle Movie&quot;, was greenlit. It picks up from where the series ended and resolved unanswered plotlines of the story. The film premiered on November 24, 2017, on Nickelodeon, Nicktoons Network, TeenNick, NickRewind and on November 24, 2018 as an international theatrical release, wrapping up the series&#x27; storyline.

==Premise==
===Setting===
&quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; takes place in the urban fictional American city of Hillwood. Creator Craig Bartlett described the city as &quot;an amalgam of large northern cities I have loved, including Seattle (my hometown), Portland (where I went to art school) and Brooklyn (the bridge, the brownstones, the subway)&quot;; the city also contains inspirations from Chicago, such as a baseball field called Quigley Field (a reference to the real-life Wrigley Field). Evan Levine of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; commented on the series&#x27;s &quot;backdrop of dark streets, nighttime adventures and rundown buildings, all seen from a child&#x27;s point of view.&quot;

At the end of the episode &quot;Road Trip&quot;, when Helga and Miriam are returning home after having car troubles en route to South Dakota, they pass a sign marking the Washington State border, implying that Hillwood is in Washington. The Pig War, as re-enacted in the episode of the same title, took place on the boundary between what is now British Columbia and the state of Washington. A bridge that leads to downtown Hillwood resembles Portland&#x27;s Burnside Bridge, while Gerald&#x27;s house was modeled after the Victorian houses seen in Nob Hill, Portland.

===Characters===

&quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; features nine-year-old Arnold Shortman (voiced by Lane Toran; Phillip Van Dyke; Spencer Klein; and Alex D. Linz) and his neighborhood friends: Gerald Johanssen (voiced by Jamil Walker Smith), a street-smart character who generally serves as the leader of the group; and Helga Pataki (Francesca Marie Smith), a girl who bullies Arnold in order to hide the fact that she is in love with him. Bartlett drew inspiration from people he grew up with when creating the characters for the show.

Arnold lives with his eccentric but loving paternal grandparents, Phil Shortman (Dan Castellaneta) and Gertrude Shortman (Tress MacNeille), proprietors of the Sunset Arms boarding house, in the fictional city of Hillwood. In each episode, he helps a schoolmate or boarding house tenant in solving a personal problem or encounters a predicament of his own. Many episodes involve urban legends (usually told by Gerald), such as superheroes or the Headless Horseman.

Other characters include students and faculty at P.S. 118, Arnold&#x27;s school, and citizens of Hillwood. Certain episodes focus on the lives of supporting characters, such as the tenants of the boarding house that Arnold&#x27;s grandparents own.

==Episodes==

==Production==
Craig Bartlett, the show&#x27;s creator, was born in Seattle, Washington, which he used as inspiration for the backdrop of &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;. He graduated from Anacortes High School and obtained a degree in communications from The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington. During high school and college, he studied painting and sculpture at the Museum Art School in Portland. Originally, Bartlett intended to become a painter &quot;in the 19th-century sense&quot;, but he became interested in animation during a trip to Italy. His first post-graduation job was at Will Vinton Productions, a claymation studio in Portland.

In 1987, Bartlett relocated to Los Angeles, where he joined a team developing claymation cutaways for the television program &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;. The short segments centered on a character named Penny and her friend Arnold. Bartlett later made three &quot;Arnold&quot; shorts: &quot;Arnold Escapes from Church&quot; (1988), &quot;The Arnold Waltz&quot; (1990), and &quot;Arnold Rides a Chair&quot; (1991), the latter aired as a filler short on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 1991. The same year, &quot;Arnold&quot; comic strips also appeared in &quot;Simpsons Illustrated&quot; magazine by Bartlett&#x27;s brother-in-law Matt Groening, the creator of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

Bartlett later joined the staff for &quot;Rugrats&quot;, where he served as story editor for three years. In 1993, he teamed up with five writers from &quot;Rugrats&quot; to develop animated projects for Nickelodeon. These meetings were generally difficult and the writers became frustrated; Bartlett recalled: &quot;Our ideas were OK, but such a large and motley group couldn&#x27;t get far at pitch meetings. Network execs got migraines just counting us coming in the door.&quot; As a last resort, Bartlett played the &quot;Penny&quot; tapes, intending to highlight the Penny character. However, the executives were more impressed by Arnold, despite his status as a minor character. After the meeting, the group began developing Arnold, creating his personality. Bartlett stated: &quot;We did a lot of talking about who Arnold is. We came up with a reluctant hero who keeps finding himself responsible for solving something, making the right choices, doing the right thing.&quot; After creating ideas for Arnold, Bartlett began work on the supporting characters, drawing influence from his childhood: &quot;A lot of the characters are an amalgam of people I knew when I was a kid. The girls in &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; are girls that either liked or didn&#x27;t like me when I was in school.&quot;

In 1994, Bartlett began work on the pilot episode of &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;. A year later, the network decided to begin work on the series. The ten-minute pilot episode, titled &quot;Arnold&quot;, was shown in theaters on July 10, 1996, before Nickelodeon&#x27;s first feature-length film, its adaptation of &quot;Harriet the Spy&quot;. Apart from the animation style, Nick&#x27;s Arnold wears a sweater, with his plaid shirt untucked (resembling a kilt). Only Arnold&#x27;s cap remains unchanged from his original clay-animation wardrobe.

&quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; was Nickelodeon&#x27;s first animated series to feature kids voiced by actual children instead of adults. As a result of this, many of the boy characters, including Arnold himself, were recast at least once throughout the show&#x27;s run, due to the child actors reaching puberty. One notable exception to this was Jamil Walker Smith, the voice of Gerald. After Smith&#x27;s voice changed, auditions for a new actor were held, but the crew felt none of them were suitable replacements. As a result, Smith was kept on as the voice of Gerald, whose voice subsequently changed in-universe with the episode &quot;Gerald&#x27;s Tonsils&quot;. This would last until &quot;The Jungle Movie&quot;, which featured Benjamin Flores Jr. as the voice of Gerald instead.

Production of &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; wrapped on December 7, 2001. A dispute over a second then-planned &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; movie, &quot;The Jungle Movie&quot;, resulted in Bartlett leaving Nickelodeon. The last season&#x27;s episodes were released over four years, beginning on March 4, 2000. The series aired its final episode, unannounced, on June 8, 2004. &quot;The Jungle Movie&quot; was eventually released as a television film on November 24, 2017.

==Broadcast==
===United States===
&quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States from October 7, 1996, until June 8, 2004, with reruns until September 1, 2006. Nicktoons Network aired reruns of the series from May 1, 2002 to February 11, 2024. The show aired in reruns on the now-defunct &quot;Nick on CBS&quot; programming block for two years, from September 14, 2002, to September 4, 2004.

Some of the episodes can now be viewed on the free app Pluto TV under the channel Nickelodeon&#x27;s 90s Kids.

===International===
&quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; premiered on October 30, 1996, in the United Kingdom, originally on CITV. &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; aired in reruns on Canadian Nickelodeon from January 10, 2010, to August 28, 2022. In 2017, the Kenya Film Classification Board banned &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;, together with the cartoon series &quot;The Loud House&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Korra&quot; from Nickelodeon, &quot;Steven Universe&quot;, &quot;Clarence&quot; and &quot;Adventure Time&quot; from Cartoon Network, from being broadcast in Kenya. According to the Board, the reason was that these series were &quot;glorifying homosexual behavior&quot;.

==Critical reception==
In an article for &quot;Vox&quot;, Caroline Framke praised &quot;Hey Arnold&quot;″s depiction of adolescence and urban life, stating: &quot;&quot;Hey Arnold&quot; wove urban legends into its empathetic narrative of how hard it can be to grow up — and how rewarding the process can be when you have some friends and a whole lot of imagination.&quot; Rafael Motamayor of &quot;/Film&quot; echoed that sentiment, writing &quot;Rather than show it as a scary place where every cop show in America is set, Arnold and his friends demonstrated that the city is also a place with endless possibilities, myths, and characters. Not that the show encouraged anything bad; the kids always knew where to go and where not to go. But it showed the reality of millions of kids who grew up in urban areas, and challenged the idea of the perfect American life&quot;. &quot;Bustle&quot;&#x27;s Marie Grace Goris suggested the series as the &quot;best Nickelodeon cartoon of all time&quot; and gave sixteen reasons why, such as its diverse characters and its ability to &quot;emotionally stir&quot; viewers.

==Attempted spinoff==
&quot;The Patakis&quot; was an attempted spinoff that never materialised.

==Films==
===2002 feature film===

In this 2002 feature film, Arnold, Helga and Gerald set out on a quest to save their old neighborhood from a greedy developer who plans on converting it into a huge shopping mall. This film was directed by Tuck Tucker, and featured guest voice talents of Jennifer Jason Leigh, Paul Sorvino and Christopher Lloyd.

In 1998, Nickelodeon gave Craig Bartlett the chance to develop a feature adaptation of the series. As work on the fifth season was completing, Bartlett and company engaged in the production of &quot;Arnold Saves the Neighborhood&quot;, which would eventually become &quot;Hey Arnold!: The Movie&quot;. The &quot;Neighborhood&quot; project was originally made for television and home video, but executives at Paramount Pictures decided to release it theatrically after successful test screenings. According to animation historian Jerry Beck (in his &quot;Animated Movie Guide&quot;), the decision was buoyed by the financial success of the first two &quot;Rugrats&quot; movies, &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot; and &quot;Rugrats in Paris: The Movie&quot;.

===2017 television film===

In an interview with Arun Mehta, Craig Bartlett announced that he was working with Nickelodeon on a &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; revival. In September 2015, Nickelodeon president Russell Hicks announced that the company was considering revivals for a number of their older shows, including &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;. According to an announcement by &quot;The Independent&quot;, a &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; revival is &quot;very much on the cards&quot;. On November 23, 2015, Nickelodeon announced that a TV movie is in the works and will pick up right where the series left off. The film will also answer unanswered questions about the fate of Arnold&#x27;s parents. On March 1, 2016, it was announced that the TV film, &quot;The Jungle Movie&quot;, would be divided into two parts and would air in 2017. On March 6, 2016, voice actress Nika Futterman confirmed on Twitter that she and her character Olga Pataki would appear in the two-hour film. In June 2016, it was confirmed that the TV film would be titled &quot;The Jungle Movie&quot;, and that 19 of the original voice actors from the series would lend their voices in the film. New cast-members included Mason Vale Cotton as Arnold; Benjamin &quot;Lil&#x27; P-Nut&quot; Flores as Gerald; Gavin Lewis as Eugene; Jet Jurgensmeyer as Stinky; Aiden Lewandowski as Sid; Laya Hayes as Nadine; Nicolas Cantu as Curly; Wally Wingert as Oskar; Stephen Stanton as Pigeon Man; and Alfred Molina as the villain Lasombra. The film debuted on November 24, 2017, on Nickelodeon.

==Future==
Before the premiere of &quot;The Jungle Movie&quot;, Nickelodeon stated that if the ratings of the film would succeed they would consider rebooting the series. Though the ratings were a success with millennials, it ended up missing the mark with Generation Z, so the idea of bringing back the show on Nickelodeon was scrapped. However, in August 2018, musical composer for the show Jim Lang revealed in a Tunes/Toons podcast that while Nick will not produce the show at the studio due to the poor ratings of &quot;The Jungle Movie&quot;, he said that: &quot;Netflix, Amazon, Apple were all people that they were going to go out to with the idea of trying to make a season six of &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;. We haven&#x27;t heard anything yet, but we&#x27;ve got our fingers crossed.&quot; In October 2019, Craig Bartlett revealed in an interview with &quot;The Arun Mehta Show&quot; that &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; could come back as a series with the characters aged up for season 6 if the &quot;Rugrats&quot; reboot is successful.

==Soundtrack==
&quot;Hey Arnold! The Music, Volume 1&quot; was released on July 3, 2020 as a vinyl record, marking the first-ever official release of the show&#x27;s music. The soundtrack included 45 minutes of previously unreleased music that had been remastered from the original audio files by Emmy Award-winning sound engineer Dave Marino in conjunction with show composer Jim Lang, as well as new original exclusive artwork done by Bartlett.

<text>Bustards, including floricans and korhaans, are large, terrestrial birds living mainly in dry grassland areas and in steppe regions. They range in length from . They make up the family Otididae (, formerly known as Otidae).

Bustards are omnivorous and opportunistic, eating leaves, buds, seeds, fruit, small vertebrates, and invertebrates. There are 26 species currently recognised.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;bustard&quot; comes from the Old French &quot;bistarda&quot; and some other languages: &quot;abetarda&quot; (pt), &quot;abetarda&quot; (gl), &quot;avutarda&quot; (es) used for the great bustard. The naturalist William Turner listed the English spelling &quot;bustard&quot; and &quot;bistard&quot; in 1544.

All of the common names above are derived from Latin &quot;avis tarda&quot; or &quot;aves tardas&quot; given by Pliny the Elder, these names were mentioned by the Pierre Belon in 1555 and Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1600. The word &quot;tarda&quot; comes from &quot;tardus&quot; in Latin meaning &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;deliberate&quot;, which is apt to describe the typical walking style of the species.

===Floricans===
Some Indian bustards are also called floricans. The origin of the name is unclear. Thomas C. Jerdon writes in &quot;The Birds of India&quot; (1862)

The Hobson-Jobson dictionary, however, casts doubt on this theory stating that

== Taxonomy ==

The family Otididae was introduced (as Otidia) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815. &quot;Otididae&quot; and before that &quot;Otidae&quot; come from the genus &quot;Otis&quot; given to the great bustard by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; in 1758, it comes from the Greek word &quot;ōtis&quot;.

== Description ==
Bustards are all fairly large with the two largest species, the kori bustard (&quot;Ardeotis kori&quot;) and the great bustard (&quot;Otis tarda&quot;), being frequently cited as the world&#x27;s heaviest flying birds. In both the largest species, large males exceed a weight of , weigh around on average and can attain a total length of . The smallest species is the little brown bustard (&quot;Eupodotis humilis&quot;), which is around long and weighs around on average. In most bustards, males are substantially larger than females, often about 30% longer and sometimes more than twice the weight. They are among the most sexually dimorphic groups of birds. In only the floricans is the sexual dimorphism the reverse, with the adult female being slightly larger and heavier than the male.

The wings have 10 primaries and 16–24 secondary feathers. There are 18–20 feathers in the tail. The plumage is predominantly cryptic.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
Bustards are omnivorous, feeding principally on seeds and invertebrates. They make their nests on the ground, making their eggs and offspring often very vulnerable to predation. They walk steadily on strong legs and big toes, pecking for food as they go. Most prefer to run or walk over flying. They have long broad wings with &quot;fingered&quot; wingtips, and striking patterns in flight. Many have interesting mating displays, such as inflating throat sacs or elevating elaborate feathered crests. The female lays three to five dark, speckled eggs in a scrape in the ground, and incubates them alone.

== Evolution ==
Genetic dating indicates that bustards evolved 30 million years ago in either southern or eastern Africa from where they dispersed into Eurasia and Australia.

== Status and conservation ==

Bustards are gregarious outside the breeding season, but are very wary and difficult to approach in the open habitats they prefer. Most species are declining or endangered through habitat loss and hunting, even where they are nominally protected.

=== United Kingdom ===
The birds were once common and abounded on the Salisbury Plain. They had become rare by 1819 when a large male, surprised by a dog on Newmarket Heath, sold in Leadenhall Market for five guineas. The last bustard in Britain died in approximately 1832, but the bird is being reintroduced through batches of chicks imported from Russia. In 2009, two great bustard chicks were hatched in Britain for the first time in more than 170 years. Reintroduced bustards also hatched chicks in 2010.

<text>Catherine of Braganza (; 25 November 1638 – 31 December 1705) was Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland during her marriage to King Charles II, which lasted from 21 May 1662 until his death on 6 February 1685. She was the daughter of John IV of Portugal, who became the first king from the House of Braganza in 1640, after overthrowing the 60-year rule of the Spanish Habsburgs over Portugal. Catherine served as the regent of Portugal during the absence of her brother Peter II in 1701, and again in 1704–1705, after her return to her homeland as a widow.

Owing to her devotion to the Roman Catholic faith in which she had been raised, Catherine was unpopular in England. She was a special object of attack by the inventors of the Popish Plot. In 1678 the murder of Edmund Berry Godfrey was ascribed to her servants, and Titus Oates accused her of an intention to poison the king. These charges, the absurdity of which was soon shown by cross-examination, nevertheless placed Catherine for some time in great danger. On 28 November 1678, Oates accused Catherine of high treason, and the English House of Commons passed an order for the removal of her and of all Roman Catholics from the Palace of Whitehall. Several further depositions were made against her, and in June 1679 it was decided that she should stand trial, which threat however was lifted by the king&#x27;s intervention, for which she later showed him much gratitude.

Catherine produced no heirs for Charles, having suffered three miscarriages. Her husband kept many mistresses, most notably Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland, whom Catherine was forced to accept as one of her Ladies of the Bedchamber. By his mistresses, Charles fathered many children, whom he acknowledged.

Catherine of Braganza is often credited with popularising the custom of drinking tea in England.

==Early life and family==
Catherine was born at the Ducal Palace of Vila Viçosa as the second surviving daughter of John, 8th Duke of Braganza, and his wife, Luisa de Guzmán. Following the Portuguese Restoration War, her father was acclaimed King John IV of Portugal on 1 December 1640. With her father&#x27;s new position as one of Europe&#x27;s most important monarchs, Portugal then possessing the widespread colonial Portuguese Empire, Catherine became a prime choice for a wife for European royalty, and she was proposed as a bride for John of Austria, the duc de Beaufort, Louis XIV of France and Charles II of England. The consideration for the final choice was due to her being seen as a useful conduit for contracting an alliance between Portugal and England after the Treaty of the Pyrenees of 1659, in which Portugal was arguably abandoned by France. Despite her country&#x27;s ongoing struggle with Spain, Catherine enjoyed a happy, contented childhood in her beloved Lisbon.

Commonly regarded as the power behind the throne, Queen Luisa was also a devoted mother who took an active interest in her children&#x27;s upbringing and personally supervised her daughter&#x27;s education. Catherine is believed to have spent most of her youth in a convent close by the royal palace where she remained under the watchful eye of her protective mother. It appears to have been a very sheltered upbringing, with one contemporary remarking that Catherine, &quot;was bred hugely retired&quot; and &quot;hath hardly been ten times out of the palace in her life&quot;. Catherine&#x27;s older sister Joana, Princess of Beira, died in 1653, leaving Catherine as the eldest surviving child of her parents. Her husband was chosen by Luisa, who acted as regent of her country following her husband&#x27;s death in 1656.

==Marriage==

Negotiations for the marriage began during the reign of King Charles I and were renewed immediately after the Restoration. On 23 June 1661, in spite of Spanish opposition, the marriage contract was signed. England secured Tangier (in North Africa) and the Seven Islands of Bombay (in India), trading privileges in Brazil and the Portuguese East Indies, religious and commercial freedom for English residents in Portugal, and two million Portuguese crowns (about £300,000). In return, Portugal obtained English military and naval support (which would prove to be decisive) in her fight against Spain, as well as liberty of worship for Catherine. She arrived at Portsmouth on the evening of 13–14 May 1662, but was not visited there by Charles until 20 May. &quot;There are two apparently contradictory accounts of the impression made upon Charles&quot; when he first saw his new bride. Charles wrote a letter to his chief advisor, Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon

However, Charles is also reputed to have &quot;said privately to one of his companions upon leaving the presence of his bride that &quot;upon his word, they had sent him a bat instead of a woman.&quot;&quot; However, historian Antonia Fraser considers it to be &quot;unlikely&quot; that Charles ever said this; &quot;such an unchivalrous remark would have been quite out of character. But the malicious tale does reveal how Catherine must have appeared to the English: small and dark and very, very foreign.&quot;

The following day, 21 May 1662, the couple were married at Portsmouth in two ceremonies – a Catholic one conducted in secret, followed by a public Anglican service.
On 30 September 1662, the married couple entered London as part of a large procession, which included the Portuguese delegation and many members of the court. There were also minstrels and musicians, among them ten playing shawms and twelve playing Portuguese bagpipes, those being the new Queen&#x27;s favourite instruments. The procession continued over a large bridge, especially designed and built for the occasion, which led into the palace where Henrietta Maria, the Queen Mother, waited along with the English court and nobility. This was followed by feasting and firework displays.

Catherine possessed several good qualities, but had been brought up in a convent, secluded from the world, and was scarcely a wife Charles would have chosen for himself. Her mother-in-law, the Queen Mother, was pleased with her, and wrote that she is &quot;the best creature in the world, from whom I have so much affection, I have the joy to see the King love her extremely. She is a Saint!&quot; In reality, her marriage was plagued by infidelities on Charles&#x27;s side.

Little is known of Catherine&#x27;s own thoughts on the match. While her mother plotted to secure an alliance with England and thus support Portugal&#x27;s fight for independence, and her future husband celebrated his restoration by dallying with his mistresses, Catherine&#x27;s time had been spent in the sombre seclusion of her convent home, with little opportunity for fun or frivolity. Even outside the convent, her actions were governed by the strict etiquette of the royal court of Portugal. By all accounts, Catherine grew into a quiet, even-tempered young woman.

Catherine became pregnant and miscarried at least three times, and during a severe illness in 1663, she imagined, for a time, that she had given birth. Charles comforted her by telling her she had indeed given birth to two sons and a daughter. Her position was a difficult one, and though Charles continued to have children by his many mistresses, he insisted she be treated with respect, and sided with her against his mistresses when he felt that she was not receiving due respect. After her three miscarriages, it seemed to be more and more unlikely that the queen would bear an heir. Royal advisors urged the monarch to seek a divorce, hoping that the new wife would be Protestant and fertile – but Charles refused. This eventually led to her being made a target by courtiers. Throughout his reign, Charles firmly dismissed the idea of divorcing Catherine, and she remained faithful to Charles throughout their marriage.

==Queen consort (1662–1685) ==
Catherine was not a particularly popular choice of queen, since she was a Roman Catholic. Her religion prevented her from being crowned, as Roman Catholics were forbidden to take part in Anglican services. She initially faced hardships due to the language barrier, the king&#x27;s infidelities and the political conflicts between Roman Catholics and Anglicans. Over time, her quiet decorum, loyalty and genuine affection for Charles changed the public&#x27;s perception of her.

Although her difficulties with the English language persisted, as time went on, the once rigidly formal Portuguese Infanta mellowed and began to enjoy some of the more innocent pleasures of the court. She loved to play cards and shocked devout Protestants by playing on Sundays. She enjoyed dancing and took great delight in organising masques. She had a great love for the countryside and picnics; fishing and archery were also favourite pastimes. In 1670, on a trip to Audley End with her ladies-in-waiting, the once chronically shy Catherine attended a country fair disguised as a village maiden, but was soon discovered and, due to the large crowds, forced to make a hasty retreat. And when in 1664 her favourite painter, Jacob Huysmans, a Flemish Catholic, painted her as St Catherine, it promptly set a trend among court ladies.

She did not involve herself in English politics, instead she kept up an active interest in her native country. Anxious to re-establish good relations with the pope and perhaps gain recognition for Portuguese independence, she sent Richard Bellings, later her principal secretary, to Rome with letters for the pope and several cardinals. In 1669 she involved herself in the last-ditch effort to relieve Candia in Crete, which was under siege by the Ottoman Empire and whose cause Rome was promoting, although she failed to persuade her husband to take any action. In 1670, as a sign of her rising favour with the then-new Pope Clement X, she requested and was granted devotional objects. The same year, Charles II ordered the building of a Royal yacht HMY &quot;Saudadoes&quot; for her, used for pleasure trips on the River Thames and to maintain communications with the Queen&#x27;s homeland of Portugal, making the journey twice.

Catherine fainted when Charles&#x27;s official mistress, Barbara Palmer was presented to her. Charles insisted on making Palmer Catherine&#x27;s Lady of the Bedchamber. After this incident, Catherine withdrew from spending time with the king, declaring she would return to Portugal rather than openly accept the arrangement with Palmer. Clarendon failed to convince her to change her mind. Charles then dismissed nearly all the members of Catherine&#x27;s Portuguese retinue, after which she stopped actively resisting, which pleased the king, however she participated very little in court life and activities.

==Catholicism==

Though known to keep her faith a private matter, her religion and proximity to the king made her the target of anti-Catholic sentiment. Catherine occupied herself with her faith. Her piety was widely known and was a characteristic in his wife that the King greatly admired; in his letters to his sister, Catherine&#x27;s devoutness is described almost with awe. Her household contained between four and six priests, and in 1665, Catherine decided to build a religious house east of St James&#x27;s to be occupied by thirteen Portuguese Franciscans of the order of St Peter of Alcantara. It was completed by 1667 and would become known as The Friary.
In 1675 the stress of a possible revival of the divorce project indirectly led to another illness, which Catherine&#x27;s physicians claimed and her husband cannot fail to have noted, was &quot;due as much to mental as physical causes&quot;. In the same year, all Irish and English Catholic priests were ordered to leave the country, which left Catherine dependent upon foreign priests. As increasingly harsher measures were put in place against Catholics, Catherine appointed her close friend and adviser, the devoutly Catholic Francisco de Mello, former Portuguese Ambassador to England, as her lord chamberlain. It was an unusual and controversial move but &quot;wishing to please Catherine and perhaps demonstrate the futility of moves for divorce, the King granted his permission. De Mello was dismissed the following year for ordering the printing of a Catholic book, leaving the beleaguered Catherine even more isolated at court&quot;. One consolation was that Louise de Kérouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth, who replaced Barbara Palmer as reigning mistress, always treated the Queen with proper deference; the Queen in return showed her gratitude by using her own influence to protect Louise during the Popish Plot.

===Popish plot===

The Test Act 1673 had driven all Catholics out of public office, and anti-Catholic feelings intensified in the years to come. Although she was not active in religious politics, in 1675 Catherine was criticised for supposedly supporting the idea of appointing a bishop to England who, it was hoped, would resolve the internal disputes of Catholics. Critics also noted the fact that, despite orders to the contrary, English Catholics attended her private chapel.

As the highest-ranking Catholic in the country, Catherine was an obvious target for Protestant extremists, and it was hardly surprising that the Popish Plot of 1678 would directly threaten her position. However, Catherine was completely secure in her husband&#x27;s favour (&quot;she could never do anything wicked, and it would be a horrible thing to abandon her&quot; he told Gilbert Burnet), and the House of Lords, most of whom knew her and liked her, refused by an overwhelming majority to impeach her. Relations between the royal couple became notably warmer: Catherine wrote of Charles&#x27;s &quot;wonderful kindness&quot; to her and it was noted that his visits to her quarters became longer and more frequent.

==After Charles&#x27;s death==

During Charles&#x27;s final illness in 1685, she showed anxiety about his reconciliation with the Roman Catholic faith, and she exhibited great grief at his death. When he lay dying in 1685, he asked for Catherine, but she sent a message asking that her presence be excused and &quot;to beg his pardon if she had offended him all his life.&quot; He answered, &quot;Alas poor woman! she asks for my pardon? I beg hers with all my heart; take her back that answer.&quot; Later in the same year, she unsuccessfully interceded with James II for the life of James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, Charles&#x27;s illegitimate son and leader of the Monmouth Rebellion – even though Monmouth in rebellion had called upon the support represented by the staunch Protestants opposed to the Catholic Church.

Catherine remained in England, living at Somerset House, through the reign of James and his deposition in the Glorious Revolution by William III and Mary II. She remained in England partly because of a protracted lawsuit against her former Lord Chamberlain, Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon, over money that she claimed as part of her allowance and that he claimed was part of the perquisite of his office. Catherine&#x27;s fondness for money is one of the more unexpected features of her character: her brother-in-law James, who was himself notably avaricious, remarked that she always drove a hard bargain.

Initially on good terms with William and Mary, her position deteriorated as the practice of her religion led to misunderstandings and increasing isolation. A bill was introduced to Parliament to limit the number of Catherine&#x27;s Catholic servants, and she was warned not to agitate against the government.

According to Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon, in her widowhood she secretly married his relation Louis de Duras, 2nd Earl of Feversham, despite the earl being a lifelong Protestant.

==Back in Portugal==
She finally returned to Portugal in March 1692.

In 1703, she supported the Methuen Treaty between Portugal and England. She acted as regent for her brother, Peter II, in 1701 and 1704–05. Catherine was a mentor for her nephew, Dom João Prince of Brazil, from 1706 onward, the Portuguese Sun King (o Rei-Sol Português). His reign saw the rise of Portugal and its monarchy to new levels of prosperity, wealth, and prestige among European courts.

She died at the Bemposta Palace in Lisbon on 31 December 1705 and was buried at the Pantheon of the House of Braganza.

==Legacy==

Catherine&#x27;s marriage had an important result for the later history of India and of the British Empire. Charles II rented the Seven Islands of Bombay, part of her dowry, to the East India Company which moved its presidency there – resulting in Bombay/Mumbai eventually growing to become one of the main cities of India.

Catherine is often credited with popularizing tea drinking in Britain.

Queens, a borough of New York City, was supposedly named after Catherine of Braganza since she was queen when Queens County was established in 1683. Queens&#x27; naming is consistent with those of Kings County (the borough of Brooklyn, originally named after her husband, King Charles II) and Richmond County (the borough of Staten Island, named after his illegitimate son, the 1st Duke of Richmond). However, there is no historical evidence that Queens County was named in her honour, neither is there a document from the time proclaiming it so. Some written histories of Queens skip over the monarch entirely and make no mention of her.

After the tri-centennial of the establishment of Queens County in 1983, the Portuguese-American &quot;Friends of Queen Catherine&quot; society began raising money to erect a 35-foot statue of Queen Catherine on the East River waterfront in Long Island City. Audrey Flack was hired by the society to serve as the sculptor of the proposed statue, and the project received support from several notable public figures in New York City, including Claire Shulman and Donald Trump. However, the project was well into development when opposition to the statue arose from multiple parties; historians objected to the statue on the grounds that there was no evidence that Queens was actually named after her, and thought that the location of the proposed statue was misplaced. Meanwhile, the African-American Bethesda Missionary Baptist Church opposed plans for the statue after allegations that Queen Catherine and the House of Braganza had profited from the slave trade emerged, while Irish-Americans in Queens were upset that the proposed statue would eclipse the Calvary Cemetery, which had been established for the Irish immigrant community in the United States. As a result of this public opposition, Shulman was forced to withdraw her support, and the statue was never erected. A quarter-scale model survives at the site of Expo &#x27;98 in Lisbon, Portugal, facing west across the Atlantic.

Catherine Street, formerly Brydges Street, in central London is named after her.

Novelists, notably Margaret Campbell Barnes in &quot;With All My Heart&quot;, Jean Plaidy in her Charles II trilogy and Susanna Gregory in her &quot;Thomas Chaloner&quot; mystery novels, usually portray the Queen in a sympathetic light. So did Alison Macleod in her 1976 biography of the queen, &quot;The Portingale&quot; and Isabel Stilwell in her 2008 historical novel &quot;Catherine of Braganza – The courage of a Portuguese Infanta who became Queen of England&quot;.

==Arms==
The royal arms of the British monarch are impaled with the royal arms of her father. For supporters, she used the crowned lion of England on the dexter side, and on the sinister, the wyvern Vert of Portugal.

<text>Chiang Rai (, ; เจียงฮาย, ) is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces, which lies in upper northern Thailand and is Thailand&#x27;s northernmost province. It is bordered by the Shan State of Myanmar to the north, Bokeo province of Laos to the east, Phayao to the south, Lampang to the southwest, and Chiang Mai to the west. The provinces is linked to Houayxay Laos by the Fourth Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge that spans the Mekong.

==Geography==
The average elevation of the province is . The north of the province is part of the so-called &quot;Golden Triangle&quot;, where the borders of Thailand, Laos and Burma converge, an area which prior to the rise of agricultural production of coffee, pineapple, coconuts, and banana plantations, was unsafe because of drug smuggling across the borders. The Mekong River forms the boundary with Laos, the Mae Sai and Ruak River with Burma. Through the town of Chiang Rai itself, flows the &quot;Mae Kok&quot; Kok River and south of it the Lao River, a tributary of the Kok.

While the eastern part of the province is characterized by relatively flat river plains, the northern and western part consists of the hilly terrain of the Thai highlands with the Khun Tan Range and the Phi Pan Nam Range in the west and the Daen Lao Range in the north. While not the highest elevation of the province, the high Doi Tung (&quot;Flag Hill&quot;) is the most important terrain feature. Wat Phra That Doi Chom Thong wat on top of the hill, according to the chronicles, dates back to the year 911. Nearby is Doi Tung Royal Villa, former residence of the late princess mother Somdej Phra Srinagarindra (mother of King Rama IX). Thanks to her activities the hills were reforested, and the hill tribes diverted from growing opium poppies to other crops including coffee, bananas, coconuts, and pineapples. The total forest area is or 39.9 percent of provincial area.

===National parks===
There are seven national parks, along with one other national park, make up region 15 of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas.
* Doi Luang National Park, 
* Lam Nam Kok National Park, 
* Mae Puem National Park, 
* Phu Sang National Park, 
* Khun Chae National Park, 
* Phu Chi Fa National Park, 
* Tham Luang–Khun Nam Nang Non National Park, 

==History==
Chiang Rai was founded in 1262. Populations have dwelled in Chiang Rai since the 7th century and it became the center of the Lanna Kingdom during the 13th century. The region, rich in natural resources, was occupied by the Burmese until 1786.

Chiang Rai province&#x27;s golden triangle bordering Laos and Burma was once the hub of opium production.

Chiang Rai became a province in 1910, after being part of the Lanna Kingdom for centuries. After Lanna was incorporated into Thailand, it remained an autonomous region and thus the Chiang Rai area was administered from Chiang Mai.

Chiang Rai province is a transit point for Rohingya refugees from Myanmar (Burma) who are transported there from Sangkhlaburi district in Kanchanaburi province.

In September 2014, there was a major flood in Chiang Rai province, affecting six districts. It was the most severe flood in 50 years.

==Demographics==
The majority of the population are ethnic Thai who speak Kham Muang among themselves, but 12.5% are of hill tribes origin, a sizeable minority in the north provinces. A smaller number are of Chinese descent, mainly descendants of the Kuomintang soldiers who settled in the region, notably in Santikhiri.

== Ethnic groups ==
Khon Muang are the city folk who originally came from Chiang Mai, Lamphun, Lampang, and Phrae. Culturally, they design their houses having only one floor with wooden gable decorations called &quot;ka-lae&quot;. They are known for their craftsmanship in wood carving, weaving, lacquer ware, and musical instruments.

Tai Yai (ไทใหญ่) (Shan) are a Tai ethnic group who primarily live in what is now Shan State in Burma, and also in Mae Hong Son province in Thailand. They grow rice, farm, raise cattle, and trade. Their craftsmanship lies in weaving, pottery, wood carving, and bronze ware.

Akha have the largest population of any hill tribe in the region. Originating from Tibet and southern China, they dwell on high ground around 1,200 meters above sea level. Within their villages they build spirit gateways to protect them from evil spirits.

Lahu (Musor) are also from the Yunnanese area and live in high areas. They are known as hunters and planters.
Karen live in various areas of the region which have valleys and riverbanks.

Chin Haw in Chiang Rai consist primarily of the former Kuomintang (KMT army) who took refuge in the area, mainly in Santikhiri (formerly Mae Salong).
Hmong from southern China, inhabit high ground. They raise livestock and grow rice, corn, tobacco, and cabbage. They are also known for their embroidery and silver.

Tai Lue (Dai) live in dwellings of usually only a single room wooden house built on high poles. They are skilled in weaving.

Lisu from southern China and Tibet are renowned for their colorful dress and also build their dwellings on high stilts. They harvest rice and corn and their men are skilled in hunting.

Yao (Mien) reside along mountain sides and grow corn and other crops. They are skilled blacksmiths, silversmiths, and embroiders.
==Symbols==

The seal of the province shows a white elephant, the royal symbol, recalling that Chiang Rai was founded by King Mengrai, according to legend because his elephant liked the place.

The provincial tree is the tree jasmine (&quot;Radermachera ignea&quot;), and the provincial flower is the orange trumpet (&quot;Pyrostegia venusta&quot;). The giant catfish (&quot;Pangasianodon gigas&quot;) is the provincial aquatic life.

The former provincial slogan was &quot;เหนือสุดในสยาม อร่ามดอยตุง ผดุงวัฒนธรรม รสล้ำข้าวสาร หอมหวานลิ้นจี่ สตรีโสภา ชาเลิศรส สัปปะรดนางแล&quot;, &#x27;Northernmost of Siam, beautiful Doi Tung, repository of culture, most delicious rice, sweet and fragrant lychee, beautiful women, the finest flavoured tea, pineapple from Nang Lae, source of the giant catfish&quot;.

The current slogan is &quot;เหนือสุดในสยาม ชายแดนสามแผ่นดิน ถิ่นวัฒนธรรมล้านนา ล้ำค่าพระธาตุดอยตุง&quot;, &#x27;Northernmost of Siam, frontier of three lands, the home of Lan Na culture and Doi Tung Temple&#x27;.

<text>Brooke Foss Westcott (12 January 1825 – 27 July 1901) was an English bishop, biblical scholar and theologian, serving as Bishop of Durham from 1890 until his death. He is perhaps most known for co-editing &quot;The New Testament in the Original Greek&quot; in 1881. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the British Empire.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Birmingham. His father, Frederick Brooke Westcott, was a botanist. Westcott was educated at King Edward VI School, Birmingham, under James Prince Lee, where he became friends with Joseph Barber Lightfoot, later Bishop of Durham.

The period of Westcott&#x27;s childhood was one of political ferment in Birmingham and amongst his earliest recollections was one of Thomas Attwood leading a large procession of men to a meeting of the Birmingham Political Union in 1831. A few years after this Chartism led to serious disturbances in Birmingham and many years later Westcott would refer to the deep impression the experiences of that time had made upon him.

In 1844, Westcott entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was invited to join the Cambridge Apostles. He became a scholar in 1846, won a Browne medal for a Greek ode in 1846 and 1847, and the Members&#x27; Prize for a Latin essay in 1847 and 1849. He took his BA degree in January 1848, obtaining double-first honours. In mathematics, he was twenty-fourth wrangler, Isaac Todhunter being senior. In classics, he was senior, being bracketed with Charles Broderick Scott, afterwards headmaster of Westminster School.

==Early teaching career==
After obtaining his degree, Westcott remained in residence at Trinity. In 1849, he obtained his fellowship; and in the same year, he was made deacon by his old headmaster, James Prince Lee, now Bishop of Manchester. In 1851 he was ordained and became an assistant master at Harrow School. As well as studying, Westcott took pupils at Cambridge; fellow readers included his school friend Lightfoot and two other men who became his attached and lifelong friends, Edward White Benson and Fenton Hort. The friendship with Lightfoot and Hort influenced his future life and work.

He devoted much attention to philosophical, patristic and historical studies, but his main interest was in New Testament work. In 1851, he published his Norrisian prize essay with the title &quot;Elements of the Gospel Harmony&quot;. The Cambridge University Norrisian Prize for theology was established in 1781 by the will of John Norris Esq of Whitton, Norfolk for the best essay by a candidate between the ages of twenty and thirty on a theological subject.

He combined his school duties with his theological research and literary writings. He worked at Harrow for nearly twenty years under Charles Vaughan and Henry Montagu Butler, but he was never good at maintaining discipline among large numbers.

==Early theological writings==
In 1855, he published the first edition of his &quot;History of the New Testament Canon&quot;, which, frequently revised and expanded, became the standard English work on the subject. In 1859, there appeared his &quot;Characteristics of the Gospel Miracles&quot;.

In 1860, he expanded his &quot;Elements of the Gospel Harmony&quot; essay into an &quot;Introduction to the Study of the Gospels&quot;. Westcott&#x27;s work for Smith&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of the Bible&quot;, notably his articles on &quot;Canon,&quot; &quot;Maccabees&quot;, and &quot;Vulgate,&quot; led to the composition of his subsequent popular books, &quot;The Bible in the Church&quot; (1864) and a &quot;History of the English Bible&quot; (1869). To the same period belongs &quot;The Gospel of the Resurrection&quot; (1866). It recognised the claims of historical science and pure reason. At the time when the book appeared, his method of apologetic showed originality but was impaired by the difficulty of the style.

In 1865, he took his B.D., and in 1870, his D.D. Later, he received honorary degrees of DC.L. from Oxford (1881) and of D.D. from Edinburgh (1883). In 1868, Westcott was appointed examining chaplain by Bishop Connor Magee (of Peterborough); and in the following year, he accepted a canonry at Peterborough, which forced him to leave Harrow.

==Regius Professorship of Divinity, Cambridge==
For a time he was enthusiastic about a cathedral life, devoted to the pursuit of learning and to the development of opportunities for the religious and intellectual benefit of the diocese. But the Regius Professorship of Divinity at Cambridge fell vacant, and J. B. Lightfoot, who was then Hulsean Professor, refused it in favour of Westcott. It was due to Lightfoot&#x27;s support almost as much as to his own great merits that Westcott was elected to the chair on 1 November 1870.

Westcott now occupied a position for which he was suited. He played a leading part in raising the standard of theological study at the University. Supported by his friends Lightfoot and Hort, he reformed the regulations for degrees in divinity and was responsible for the formation and first revision of the new theology tripos. He planned lectures and organised the new Divinity School and Library.

He worked hard and forwent many of the privileges of a university career so that his studies might be more continuous and that he might see more of his students.

===Lectures===
His lectures were generally on Biblical subjects. His &quot;Commentaries on St John&#x27;s Gospel&quot; (1881), on the &quot;Epistle to the Hebrews&quot; (1889), and the &quot;Epistles of St John&quot; (1883), resulted from his public lectures.

One of his most valuable works,&quot; The Gospel of Life&quot; (1892), a study of Christian doctrine, incorporated the materials upon which he delivered a series of more private and esoteric lectures on weekday evenings. Lecturing was an intense strain to him, but his influence was immense: to attend one of Westcott&#x27;s lectures was an experience which encouraged those to whom the references to Origen or Rupert of Deutz were unintelligible.

===New Testament textual studies===
Between 1870 and 1881, Westcott was also continually engaged in text critical work for an edition of the New Testament and, simultaneously, in the preparation of a new text in conjunction with Hort. The years in which Westcott, Lightfoot and Hort could thus meet frequently and naturally for the discussion of the work in which they were all three so deeply engrossed formed a happy and privileged period in their lives.

In the year 1881, there appeared the famous Westcott and Hort text of the New Testament, upon which had been expended nearly thirty years of incessant labour.

===Educational reformer===
The reforms in the regulations for degrees in divinity, the formation and first revision of the new theological tripos, the inauguration of the Cambridge Mission to Delhi and the subsequent founding of St. Stephen&#x27;s College, Delhi, the institution of the Church Society (for the discussion of theological and ecclesiastical questions by the younger men), the meetings for the divinity faculty, the organisation of the new Divinity School and Library and, later, the institution of the Cambridge Clergy Training School (renamed Westcott House in 1901 in his honour), were all, in a very real degree, the result of Westcott&#x27;s energy and influence as Regius professor. To this list should also be added the Oxford and Cambridge preliminary examination for candidates for holy orders, with which he was from the first most closely identified.

The departure of Lightfoot to become Bishop of Durham in 1879 was a great blow to Westcott. Nevertheless, it resulted in bringing him into still greater prominence. He was compelled to take the lead in matters where Lightfoot&#x27;s more practical nature had previously been predominant.

===Canonry at Westminster Abbey===
In 1883, Westcott was elected to a professorial fellowship at King&#x27;s. Shortly afterwards, having previously resigned his canonry at Peterborough, he was appointed by the crown to a canonry at Westminster Abbey, and accepted the position of examining chaplain to Archbishop Benson.

His little edition of the &quot;Paragraph Psalter&quot; (1879), arranged for the use of choirs, and his lectures on the Apostles&#x27; Creed, entitled &quot;Historic Faith&quot; (1883), are reminiscences of his vacations spent at Peterborough. He held his canonry at Westminster in conjunction with the regius professorship.

The strain of the joint work was very heavy, and the intensity of the interest and study which he brought to bear upon his share in the labours of the Ecclesiastical Courts Commission, of which he had been appointed a member, added to his burden.

Preaching at Westminster Abbey gave him an opportunity to deal with social questions. His sermons were generally portions of a series; and to this period belong the volumes &quot;Christus Consummator&quot; (1886) and &quot;Social Aspects of Christianity&quot; (1887). Westcott&#x27;s presidency of the Christian Social Union from 1889 did much to draw mainstream, respectable churchgoers into calling for justice for the poor and unemployed in the face of the predominant laissez-faire economic policies.

==Bishop of Durham==

In March 1890, he was nominated to follow in the steps of his beloved friend Lightfoot, who had died in December 1889. His election was confirmed by Robert Crosthwaite, Bishop of Beverley (acting as commissioner for the Archbishop of York) on 30 April at York Minster and he was consecrated on 1 May at Westminster Abbey by William Thompson, Archbishop of York, Hort being the preacher, and enthroned at Durham Cathedral on 15 May.

Contrary to his reputation as a recluse and a mystic, he took a practical interest in the mining population of Durham and in the shipping and artisan industries of Sunderland and Gateshead. On occasion, in 1892 he succeeded in bringing to a peaceful solution a long and bitter strike which had divided the masters and men in the Durham collieries.

Westcott was involved in appointing the first deaconess which was new but it underlined the proposal to create women deacons as imagined by his predecessor and as argued by Emily Marshall who aspired to see women serving on an equal basis in the Anglican church.

He has been described as a Christian socialist and was a staunch supporter of the co-operative movement. He was practically the founder of the Christian Social Union. He continually insisted upon the necessity of promoting the cause of foreign missions; four of his sons went on to do missionary work for the Church in India.

He was energetic to the very end, but during the last two or three years of his life, he aged considerably. His wife died suddenly in May 1901, and he dedicated to her memory his last book, &quot;Lessons from Work&quot; (1901). He preached a farewell sermon to the miners in Durham Cathedral at their annual festival on 20 July. Then came a short, sudden and fatal illness. He was buried in the chapel of Auckland Castle.

==Family==
Westcott married, in 1852, Sarah Louisa Mary Whithard (ca 1830–1901), daughter of Thomas Middlemore Whithard, of Bristol. Mrs Westcott was for many years deeply interested in foreign missionary work. She became an invalid in her later years and died on 28 May 1901. They had seven sons and three daughters, including Frederick, who followed his father into the ministry in the Church of England, was headmaster of Sherborne School, Archdeacon of Norwich, and author of multiple books on the Letters of Saint Paul; George, Bishop of Lucknow; and Foss, who became Bishop of Calcutta and Metropolitan of India.

==Legacy and influence==
Westcott was not a narrow specialist. He loved poetry, music and art. His literary sympathies were wide. He would never tire of praising Euripides, and studied the writings of Robert Browning. He was also said to be a talented draughtsman and used often to say that if he had not taken orders he would have become an architect. He followed with delight the development of natural science studies at Cambridge. He spared no pains to be accurate, or to widen the basis of his thought. Thus he devoted one summer vacation to the careful analysis of Auguste Comte&#x27;s &quot;Politique positive&quot;.

He studied assiduously The Sacred Books of the East, and earnestly contended that no systematic view of Christianity could afford to ignore the philosophy of other religions. The outside world was wont to regard him as a mystic; and the mystical, or sacramental, view of life enters, it is true, very largely into his teaching. He had in this respect many points of similarity with the Cambridge Platonists of the 17th century, and with F. D. Maurice, for whom he had profound regard. An amusing instance of his unworldliness was his observation that &quot;I never went to the Derby. Once, though, I nearly did: I happened to be passing through Derby, that very day&quot;.

He was a strong supporter of Church reform, especially in the direction of obtaining larger powers for the laity.

He kept himself aloof from all party strife. He describes himself when he says:
His theological work assigned great importance to Divine Revelation in Holy Scripture and in the teaching of history. His own studies have largely contributed in England to their current understanding of the doctrines of the Resurrection and the Incarnation. His work in conjunction with Hort upon the Greek text of the New Testament will endure as what is thought to be one of the greatest achievements of English Biblical criticism. The principles which are explained in Hort&#x27;s introduction to the text had been arrived at after years of elaborate investigation and continual correspondence and discussion between the two friends. The place which it almost at once took among scientific scholars in Britain and throughout Europe was a recognition of the great advance which it represented in the use and classification of ancient authorities. His commentaries rank with Lightfoot&#x27;s as the best type of Biblical exegesis produced by the English Church in the 19th century.

A portrait of Westcott by William Edwards Miller is in the collection of Trinity College, Cambridge.

Brooke Foss Westcott is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 27 July.

==Controversy==
Some American fundamentalists have denounced Westcott&#x27;s and Hort&#x27;s Greek text of the Bible as corrupt. Most of these critics subscribe to the King James Only movement. King James Only author Gail Riplinger quotes them in her book &quot;New Age Bible Versions&quot;. In it, she accuses Westcott of being involved in the occult. However, Westcott himself wrote,

<text>Jean-Frédéric Maximilien de Waldeck (c. 1766 – April 30, 1875) was a French antiquarian, cartographer, artist and explorer. He was a man of talent and accomplishment, but his love of self-promotion and refusal to let the truth get in the way of a good story leave some aspects of his life in mystery.

At various times Waldeck said that he was born in Paris, Prague, or Vienna, and at other times claimed to be a German, Austrian or British citizen. He often claimed the title of count and occasionally that of duke or baron, but these cannot be verified.

Waldeck said he had traveled to southern Africa at age 19 and thereafter had begun a career in exploration. He claimed to have returned to France and studied art as a student of Jacques-Louis David. He said he had traveled to Egypt with Napoleon&#x27;s expedition. None of this has been independently verified; indeed most of Waldeck&#x27;s autobiography before about 1820 (including his given birthdate) is undocumented and his name is absent from records of various early expeditions he claimed to have been on.

Waldeck is remembered primarily for two actions. The first is publishing drawings based on the notorious set of pornographic prints titled &quot;I Modi&quot;. The second is the exploration of Mexico and the publication of many examples of Maya and Aztec sculpture. Unfortunately, errors in his illustrations fostered misconceptions about Mesoamerican civilizations and contributed to Mayanism.

==I Modi==
The &quot;I Modi&quot; drawings are highly pornographic and accompanied sonnets by Pietro Aretino. The original prints were published by the engraver Marcantonio Raimondi in the 16th century based on drawings by Giulio Romano. The publication caused a furor in Rome, and Pope Clement VII ordered that all copies be destroyed. As such, there is no known original printing of &quot;I Modi&quot; in existence. What has survived is a series of fragments in the British Museum, two copies of a single print, and a woodcut copy from the 16th century. Waldeck claimed to have found a set of tracings of the &quot;I Modi&quot; prints in a convent near Palenque in Mexico. His story is dubious because there is no such convent. However, we know that he saw the fragments now in the British Museum because the fragments can be matched to his drawings.

==Maya illustrations==

Waldeck&#x27;s first contact with the art of ancient Mesoamerica was when he was hired by the publisher Henry Berthoud to prepare some plates for an 1822 book entitled &quot;Description of the Ruins of an Ancient City&quot;. This book was an English translation of the 1787 report on Palenque by Antonio del Río which had been commissioned for Charles III of Spain and then sat unpublished in the National Archives of Spain. Waldeck&#x27;s engravings were very different than the original drawings he worked from, and gave the monuments a decidedly Egyptian look, in line with his patron&#x27;s views that the ancient Mesoamericans were the Lost Tribes of Israel.

In 1825, he was hired as a hydraulic engineer by an English mining company and went to Mexico. He did not last long at this job, and after his failure he explored the Pre-Columbian ruins of the country, living in the ruined Palenque between May 1832 and July 1833. After that, in 1834, he was hired by Lord Kingsborough to travel to Uxmal and make drawings and architectural reconstructions. Some of these were &quot;fanciful in the extreme.&quot;

In 1838, Waldeck published &quot;Voyage pittoresque et archéologique dans la province d&#x27;Yucatan pendant les années 1834 et 1836&quot; (Paris), a volume of illustrations of Mérida, Yucatán and Maya ruins, including those at Uxmal. Dedicated to Lord Kingsborough, this book provided what Waldeck believed was further support for connections between the ancient Maya and ancient Egypt. His illustration of the Pyramid of the Magician at Uxmal, for example, makes it look similar Egyptian pyramids. In 1839, he was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.

Waldeck&#x27;s illustrations of Palenque were chosen to accompany &quot;Monuments anciens du Mexique (Palenque, et autres ruines de l&#x27;ancienne civilisation du Mexique)&quot; (1866) by Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg. However, just as his earlier illustrations had implied connections between the ancient Maya and ancient Egypt, the ones included with Brasseur de Bourbourg&#x27;s text invoked the Classical antiquity of ancient Greece and Rome. His illustrations of panels of Maya script in the Temple of Inscriptions at Palenque included clear depictions of heads of elephants (now known to be erroneous embellishments). This fueled speculation about contact between the ancient Maya and Asia and the role of the mythical lost continent of Atlantis as a common link between ancient civilizations of the Old and New Worlds.

Waldeck published numerous lithographs of what he had come across. His last set of prints was published in 1866 when he celebrated his centennial.

==Death==

Waldeck is alleged to have been active until his death, at the claimed age of 109 years 45 days. He supposedly died of a heart attack while eying a beautiful woman near the &quot;Champs-Élysées&quot; in Paris.

Waldeck has been described by historians as a &quot;notorious fantasist&quot; who stated he was 120 years old. It was alleged that he prolonged his life by consuming horseradish soaked in lemon juice. His birth and death date have not been verified.

<text>Morris Motors Limited was a British privately owned motor vehicle manufacturing company formed in 1919 to take over the assets of William Morris&#x27;s WRM Motors Limited and continue production of the same vehicles. By 1926 its production represented 42 per cent of British car manufacture—a remarkable expansion rate attributed to William Morris&#x27;s practice of buying in major as well as minor components and assembling them in his own factory.

Although it merged with Austin Motor Company to form the British Motor Corporation in 1952, the Morris name remained in use until 1984, when the by-then Austin Rover Group decided to concentrate on the more popular Austin brand as well as expanding the more upmarket Rover brand.

Until 2014, Morris Oxford vehicles (based on the 1954-59 Oxford) were manufactured with periodic enhancements in India by Hindustan Motors, and sold well there, even being imported to Britain in small numbers during the 1990s.

Part of Morris&#x27;s manufacturing complex at Cowley, Oxford is now BMW Group&#x27;s Plant Oxford, factory of the MINI marque since its launch in 2001.

The Morris trademark is currently owned by the China-based automotive company SAIC after being transferred from bankrupt subsidiary Nanjing Automotive.

The Morris Commercial JE, an electric van with a 1940s design, was unveiled in November 2019 ahead of a planned launch in 2021 under the re-launched Morris Commercial marque, well over 30 years after the Morris brand had disappeared.

==History==

===Early history===
WRM Motors Ltd began in 1912 when bicycle manufacturer William Morris moved on from the sale, hire, and repair of cars to car manufacturing. He planned a new light car assembled from bought-in components. In this way he was able to retain ownership by keeping within the bounds of his own capital resources.

A factory was opened in 1913 at former Oxford Military College at Cowley, Oxford, United Kingdom where Morris&#x27;s first car, the 2-seat Morris Oxford &quot;Bullnose&quot;, was assembled. Nearly all the major components were bought in.

In 1914 a coupé and van were added to the line-up, but the Bullnose chassis was too short and the 1018 cc engine too small to make a much-needed 4-seat version of the car. White and Poppe, who made the engine, were unable to supply the volume of units that Morris required, so Morris turned to Continental of Detroit, Michigan for the supply of a 1548 cc engine. Gearboxes and axles were also sourced in the US.

In spite of the outbreak of the First World War the orders were maintained and, from mid-1915 a new larger car, the 2-seat and 4-seat Morris Cowley was introduced.

===Inter-war years===
After the war the Continental engine was no longer available so Morris arranged for Hotchkiss of France to make a near copy in their Coventry factory. This was used to power new versions of the basic Cowley and more up-market Morris Oxford cars.

With a reputation for producing high-quality cars and a policy of cutting prices, Morris&#x27;s business continued to grow and increase its share of the British market overtaking Ford to become in 1924 the UK&#x27;s biggest car manufacturer, holding a 51% share of the home market and remaining enormously profitable.

Possessed of a very large cash income Morris had a policy of personally buying up suppliers&#x27; businesses. For example, in 1923 he bought Hotchkiss&#x27;s Coventry business which later became Morris Engines branch. He also brought in F G Woollard which became Morris Commercial Cars to lead the re-organization of their engine production from batch to flow, thus increasing output from less than 300 units per week to 1200. By 1924 the factory was making 2000 units a week with only a small increase in work space and labour force.

Cecil Kimber, head of Morris&#x27;s own original 1909-founded Morris Garage sales hire and repair operation in Oxford, began building sporting versions of Morris cars in 1924 labelling them MG. They were so successful a separate MG factory was soon established south of Oxford in Abingdon, Oxfordshire.

Having admired Budd&#x27;s all-steel bodies Morris founded The Pressed Steel Company of Great Britain Limited in 1926 as a joint venture with Edward G Budd Manufacturing Company - Budd International of Philadelphia, USA. Pressed Steel&#x27;s factory was located over the road from Morris&#x27;s factory at Cowley and supplied Morris and many other motor manufacturers. Morris withdrew from the venture in mid-1930. Budd sold their share to British interests at the beginning of 1936.
The small car market was entered in 1928 with the Leonard Lord-designed Morris Minor, using an 847 cc engine from Morris&#x27;s newly acquired Wolseley Motors. Lord had been sent there to modernise the works and Wolseley&#x27;s products. The Minor was to provide the base for the MG Midgets. This timely spread into the small car market helped Morris through the economic depression of the 1930s. At the 1934 London Motor Show the Minor was replaced by the Morris Eight, a direct response to the Ford Model Y and, though Leonard Lord&#x27;s handiwork, heavily based on it.

In 1932 W R Morris appointed Lord Managing Director of Morris Motors Limited and Lord swept through the Morris works, updating the production methods, introducing a proper moving assembly line and creating Europe&#x27;s largest integrated car plant. But Morris and Lord fell out, and after 15 years Lord left in 1936—threatening to &quot;take Cowley apart brick by brick&quot;. Lord moved to Austin and they were to meet again in BMC—Morris, as Lord Nuffield, its first chairman. Lord succeeded him.

As of 1 July 1935 Morris Motors acquired from W R Morris, now Lord Nuffield, in exchange for a further issue of ordinary shares to him, the car manufacturing businesses of Wolseley Motors Limited and The MG Car Company Limited. A separate private company, Wolseley Aero Engines Limited, was then formed to continue the development of his aviation interests. In 1936 Lord Nuffield sold Morris Commercial Cars Limited, his commercial vehicle enterprise, to Morris Motors.

In 1938 William Morris, Baron Nuffield was raised to Viscount Nuffield. The same year he transferred his newly acquired Riley car business to Morris Motors Limited for £100.
===Iron Lung===
Visiting London in 1938 during a polio epidemic Lord Nuffield saw a Both Iron Lung in use. He commissioned an improved design which could be produced using the techniques of car assembly and arranged production of approximately 1700 machines at the Cowley works, which he donated to hospitals throughout all parts of Britain and the British Empire.

Both-Nuffield respirators were able to be produced by the thousand at about one-thirteenth the cost of the American design.


=== Significant subsidiaries ===
===Second World War===
In the summer of 1938 Morris agreed to build, equip and manage at government expense a huge new factory at Castle Bromwich specifically to manufacture Supermarine Spitfires. with intention to build bombers later. Nuffield&#x27;s management failed; no Spitfires were delivered by May 1940 despite expectation of 60 a day. The Ministry of Aircraft Production took over the plant putting in managers from Supermarine and placing it under Vickers-Armstrongs (of which Supermarine was a part) supervision. After a major air raid damaged the Morris Bodies factory, the premises switched to the production of jerry cans, producing millions of these versatile containers for use during the rest of the war and following the ending of hostilities. The Cowley plant was turned over to aircraft repair and production of Tiger Moth pilot trainers, as well as &quot;mine sinkers&quot; based on a design produced at the same plant during the First World War.
Morris produced the popular Morris C8 Quad artillery prime mover towing artillery (such as the 25-pounder) and anti-tank guns (such as the 17-pounder) with some 10,200 made. Morris also produced some 2200 Morris Light Reconnaissance Cars, 100 Morris CS9 armoured cars, 21,319 Morris CS8 15cwt light trucks, the Morris C4 truck, Morris ML ambulance, 500 Morris Commercial 8x8 GS Terrapin (amphibious vehicle)s, and the Morris Commercial CD series trucks.

===Post-Second World War production===

Production restarted after the Second World War, with the pre-war Eight and Ten designs. In 1948 the Eight was replaced by what is probably the most famous Morris car, the Morris Minor designed by Alec Issigonis (who later went on to design the Mini) and reusing the small car name from 1928. The Ten was replaced by a new 1948 Morris Oxford MO, styled like a larger version of the Minor. A later Morris Oxford (the 1956 Morris Oxford III) was the basis for the design of India&#x27;s Hindustan Ambassador, which continued in production until 2014.


They used six engines and five (and a half) car bodies, of which the &quot;specialist&quot; three were obsolescent, the rest very closely related if not identical.

===BMC===
In 1952 the Nuffield Organization merged with its old rival the Austin Motor Company to form the British Motor Corporation (BMC). Nuffield brought the Morris, MG, Riley and Wolseley marques into the merger. Leonard Lord was in charge, which led to Austin&#x27;s domination of the organisation. Badge-engineering was important to BMC and for many years the various marques would be seen on several families of similar vehicles.

===British Leyland===
In 1966, BMC acquired Jaguar to create British Motor Holdings (BMH), which subsequently merged with Leyland Motors in 1968 to form the British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC), and subsequently, in 1975, the nationalised British Leyland Limited (BL). The Cowley complex remained the second largest single facility in the BL empire (after Longbridge), but BL&#x27;s history was a turbulent one – BMC was close to financial ruin, and the newly installed Leyland management failed to turn its fortunes around.

With the replacement for the Morris Marina and Leyland Princess being delayed into the 1980s, the Marina was restyled in 1980 to become the Morris Ital, while the Princess was restyled for 1982 to become the Austin Ambassador. British Leyland later confirmed that the Morris brand would be discontinued on the all-new replacement for these two cars, which was finally launched in April 1984 as the Austin Montego.

The Morris Ital (essentially a facelifted Marina) was the last Morris-badged passenger car, with production ending in the summer of 1984. The last &quot;Morris&quot; of all was a van variant of the Austin Metro, before the Morris brand was finally completely abandoned in 1987.

After much restructuring of BL in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the former Morris plant at Cowley and its sister site the former Pressed Steel plant were turned over to the production of Austin and Rover-badged vehicles. They continued to be used by BL&#x27;s Austin Rover Group and its successor the Rover Group, which was eventually bought by BMW, and then by a management consortium, leading to the creation of MG Rover.

None of the former Morris buildings now exist. British Aerospace sold the site in 1992; it was then demolished and replaced with the Oxford Business Park. The adjacent former Pressed Steel site (now known as Plant Oxford) is owned and operated by BMW, who use it to assemble the new MINI.

The history of William Morris&#x27;s business is commemorated in the Morris Motors Museum at the Oxford Bus Museum.

Post-Morris cars to have been built at Cowley include the Austin/MG Maestro, Austin/MG Montego, Rover 600, Rover 800 and (for a short time) the Rover 75.

=== Cancelled Revival ===
Following the bankruptcy of the MG Rover Group in 2005, three competing bids were launched aiming to acquire the company&#x27;s assets. One of the bids, led by Maserati CEO Martin Leach alongside Chinese state-owned Shanghai Automotive Industries Corporation (SAIC), included plans for a Morris Minor revival. Despite this, the bid was lost to the Nanjing Automobile Corporation and the new Minor was not produced, although Nanjing Automobile Corporation later merged with SAIC, with all assets, including the Morris marque, being transferred to SAIC.

==Badge==
The Morris badge shows an ox fording the River Isis, the traditional emblem of William Morris&#x27;s home town of Oxford, used in the coat of arms of Oxford.

<text>Isaac Todhunter FRS (23 November 1820 – 1 March 1884), was an English mathematician who is best known today for the books he wrote on mathematics and its history.

==Life and work==

The son of George Todhunter, a Nonconformist minister, and Mary née Hume, he was born at Rye, Sussex. He was educated at Hastings, where his mother had opened a school after the death of his father in 1826. He was at first at a school run by Robert Carr, moving then to one opened by John Baptist Austin.

Todhunter became an assistant master at a school at Peckham, attending at the same time evening classes at the University College, London where he was influenced by Augustus De Morgan. In 1842 he obtained a mathematical scholarship and graduated as B.A. at London University, where he was awarded the gold medal on the M.A. examination. About this time he became mathematical master at a school at Wimbledon.

In 1844 Todhunter entered St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he was senior wrangler in 1848, and gained the first Smith&#x27;s Prize and the Burney Prize; and in 1849 he was elected to a fellowship, and began his life of college lecturer and private tutor. In 1862 he was made a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1865 a member of the London Mathematical Society. In 1871 he gained the Adams Prize and was elected to the council of the Royal Society. He was elected honorary fellow of St John&#x27;s in 1874, having resigned his fellowship on his marriage in 1864. In 1880 his eyesight began to fail, and shortly afterwards he was attacked with paralysis.

He is buried in the Mill Road cemetery, Cambridge.

==Personal life==
Todhunter married 13 August 1864 Louisa Anna Maria, eldest daughter of Captain (afterwards Admiral) George Davies, R.N. (at that time head of the county constabulary force). He died on 1 March 1884, at his residence, 6 Brookside, Cambridge. A mural tablet and medallion portrait were placed in the ante-chapel of his college by his widow, who, with four sons and one daughter, survived him.

He was a sound Latin and Greek scholar, familiar with French, German, Spanish, Italian, and also Russian, Hebrew, and Sanskrit. He was well versed in the history of philosophy, and on three occasions acted as examiner for the moral sciences tripos.

<text>Phagocytosis () is the process by which a cell uses its plasma membrane to engulf a large particle (≥ 0.5 μm), giving rise to an internal compartment called the phagosome. It is one type of endocytosis. A cell that performs phagocytosis is called a phagocyte. 

In a multicellular organism&#x27;s immune system, phagocytosis is a major mechanism used to remove pathogens and cell debris. The ingested material is then digested in the phagosome. Bacteria, dead tissue cells, and small mineral particles are all examples of objects that may be phagocytized. Some protozoa use phagocytosis as means to obtain nutrients. The two main cells that do this are the Macrophages and the Neutrophils of the immune system.

Where phagocytosis is used as a means of feeding and provides the organism part or all of its nourishment, it is called phagotrophy and is distinguished from osmotrophy, which is nutrition taking place by absorption.

==History==
The history of phagocytosis represents the scientific establishment of immunology as the process is the first immune response mechanism discovered and understood as such. The earliest definitive account of cell eating was given by Swiss scientist Albert von Kölliker in 1849. In his report in &quot;Zeitschrift für Wissenschaftliche Zoologie,&quot; Kölliker described the feeding process of an amoeba-like alga, &quot;Actinophyrys sol&quot; (a heliozoan) mentioning details of how the protist engulfed and swallowed (the process now called endocytosis) a small organism, that he named infusoria (a generic name for microbes at the time). 

The first demonstration of phagocytosis as a property of leucocytes, the immune cells, was from the German zoologist Ernst Haeckel. Haeckel discovered that blood cells of sea slug, &quot;Tethys&quot;, could ingest Indian ink (or indigo) particles. It was the first direct evidence of phagocytosis by immune cells. Haeckel reported his experiment in a 1862 monograph &quot;Die Radiolarien (Rhizopoda Radiaria): Eine Monographie.&quot;

Phagocytosis was noted by Canadian physician William Osler (1876), and later studied and named by Élie Metchnikoff (1880, 1883).

==In immune system==
Phagocytosis is one main mechanisms of the innate immune defense. It is one of the first processes responding to infection, and is also one of the initiating branches of an adaptive immune response. Although most cells are capable of phagocytosis, some cell types perform it as part of their main function. These are called &#x27;professional phagocytes.&#x27; Phagocytosis is old in evolutionary terms, being present even in invertebrates.

=== Professional phagocytic cells ===

Neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, osteoclasts and eosinophils can be classified as professional phagocytes. The first three have the greatest role in immune response to most infections.

The role of neutrophils is patrolling the bloodstream and rapid migration to the tissues in large numbers only in case of infection. There they have direct microbicidal effect by phagocytosis. After ingestion, neutrophils are efficient in intracellular killing of pathogens. Neutrophils phagocytose mainly via the Fcγ receptors and complement receptors 1 and 3. The microbicidal effect of neutrophils is due to a large repertoire of molecules present in pre-formed granules. Enzymes and other molecules prepared in these granules are proteases, such as collagenase, gelatinase or serine proteases, myeloperoxidase, lactoferrin and antibiotic proteins. Degranulation of these into the phagosome, accompanied by high reactive oxygen species production (oxidative burst) is highly microbicidal.

Monocytes, and the macrophages that mature from them, leave blood circulation to migrate through tissues. There they are resident cells and form a resting barrier. Macrophages initiate phagocytosis by mannose receptors, scavenger receptors, Fcγ receptors and complement receptors 1, 3 and 4. Macrophages are long-lived and can continue phagocytosis by forming new lysosomes.

Dendritic cells also reside in tissues and ingest pathogens by phagocytosis. Their role is not killing or clearance of microbes, but rather breaking them down for antigen presentation to the cells of the adaptive immune system.

=== Initiating receptors ===
Receptors for phagocytosis can be divided into two categories by recognised molecules. The first, opsonic receptors, are dependent on opsonins. Among these are receptors that recognise the Fc part of bound IgG antibodies, deposited complement or receptors, that recognise other opsonins of cell or plasma origin. Non-opsonic receptors include lectin-type receptors, Dectin receptor, or scavenger receptors. Some phagocytic pathways require a second signal from pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) activated by attachment to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS), which leads to NF-κB activation.

==== Fcγ receptors ====
Fcγ receptors recognise IgG coated targets. The main recognised part is the Fc fragment. The molecule of the receptor contain an intracellular ITAM domain or associates with an ITAM-containing adaptor molecule. ITAM domains transduce the signal from the surface of the phagocyte to the nucleus. For example, activating receptors of human macrophages are FcγRI, FcγRIIA, and FcγRIII. Fcγ receptor mediated phagocytosis includes formation of protrusions of the cell called a &#x27;phagocytic cup&#x27; and activates an oxidative burst in neutrophils.

==== Complement receptors ====
These receptors recognise targets coated in C3b, C4b and C3bi from plasma complement. The extracellular domain of the receptors contains a lectin-like complement-binding domain. Recognition by complement receptors is not enough to cause internalisation without additional signals. In macrophages, the CR1, CR3 and CR4 are responsible for recognition of targets. Complement coated targets are internalised by &#x27;sinking&#x27; into the phagocyte membrane, without any protrusions.

==== Mannose receptors ====
Mannose and other pathogen-associated sugars, such as fucose, are recognised by the mannose receptor. Eight lectin-like domains form the extracellular part of the receptor. The ingestion mediated by the mannose receptor is distinct in molecular mechanisms from Fcγ receptor or complement receptor mediated phagocytosis.

=== Phagosome ===
Engulfment of material is facilitated by the actin-myosin contractile system. The phagosome is the organelle formed by phagocytosis of material. It then moves toward the centrosome of the phagocyte and is fused with lysosomes, forming a phagolysosome and leading to degradation. Progressively, the phagolysosome is acidified, activating degradative enzymes.

Degradation can be oxygen-dependent or oxygen-independent.
* Oxygen-dependent degradation depends on NADPH and the production of reactive oxygen species. Hydrogen peroxide and myeloperoxidase activate a halogenating system, which leads to the creation of hypochlorite and the destruction of bacteria.
* Oxygen-independent degradation depends on the release of granules, containing enzymes such as lysozymes, Bactericidal permeability-increasing protein, Major basic protein and cationic proteins such as defensins. Other antimicrobial peptides are present in these granules, including lactoferrin, which sequesters iron to provide unfavourable growth conditions for bacteria. Other enzymes like hyaluronidase, lipase, collagenase, elastase, ribonuclease, deoxyribonuclease also play an important role in preventing the spread of infection and degradation of essential microbial biomolecules leading to cell death.

Leukocytes generate hydrogen cyanide during phagocytosis, and can kill bacteria, fungi, and other pathogens by generating several other toxic chemicals.

Some bacteria, for example &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot;, &quot;Escheria coli&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, are able to avoid phagocytosis by several mechanisms.

==In apoptosis==
Following apoptosis, the dying cells need to be taken up into the surrounding tissues by macrophages in a process called efferocytosis. One of the features of an apoptotic cell is the presentation of a variety of intracellular molecules on the cell surface, such as calreticulin, phosphatidylserine (from the inner layer of the plasma membrane), annexin A1, oxidised LDL and altered glycans. These molecules are recognised by receptors on the cell surface of the macrophage such as the phosphatidylserine receptor or by soluble (free-floating) receptors such as thrombospondin 1, GAS6, and MFGE8, which themselves then bind to other receptors on the macrophage such as CD36 and alpha-v beta-3 integrin. Defects in apoptotic cell clearance is usually associated with impaired phagocytosis of macrophages. Accumulation of apoptotic cell remnants often causes autoimmune disorders; thus pharmacological potentiation of phagocytosis has a medical potential in treatment of certain forms of autoimmune disorders.
==In protists==
Phagocytosis is used by many protists as a means of feeding, thus constituting phagotrophy.

* In some, such as amoeba, phagocytosis takes place by surrounding the target object with pseudopods, as in animal phagocytes. In humans, the amoebozoan &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot; can phagocytose red blood cells.
* Ciliates also engage in phagocytosis. In ciliates there is a specialized groove or chamber in the cell where phagocytosis takes place, called the cytostome or mouth.

As in phagocytic immune cells, the resulting phagosome may be merged with lysosomes (food vacuoles) containing digestive enzymes, forming a phagolysosome. The food particles will then be digested, and the released nutrients are diffused or transported into the cytosol for use in other metabolic processes.

Mixotrophy can involve phagotrophic nutrition and phototrophic nutrition.

<text>Simple living refers to practices that promote simplicity in one&#x27;s lifestyle. Common practices of simple living include reducing the number of possessions one owns, depending less on technology and services, and spending less money. In addition to such external changes, simple living also reflects a person&#x27;s mindset and values. Simple living practices can be seen in history, religion, art, and economics.

Adherents may choose simple living for a variety of personal reasons, such as spirituality, health, increase in quality time for family and friends, work–life balance, personal taste, financial sustainability, increase in philanthropy, frugality, environmental sustainability, or reducing stress. Simple living can also be a reaction to economic materialism and consumer culture. Some cite sociopolitical goals aligned with environmentalist, anti-consumerist, or anti-war movements, including conservation, degrowth, deep ecology, and tax resistance.

==History==

===Religious and spiritual===

A number of religious and spiritual traditions encourage simple living. Early examples include the Śramaṇa traditions of Iron Age India and biblical Nazirites. More formal traditions of simple living stretch back to antiquity, originating with religious and philosophical leaders such as Jesus, Lao Tzu, Confucius, Zarathustra, Gautama Buddha, and Prophet Muhammad. These traditions were heavily influenced by both national cultures and religious ethics. Simplicity was one of the primary concepts espoused by Lao Tzu, the founder of Taoism. This is most embodied in the principles of Pu and Ziran. Confucius has been quoted numerous times as promoting simple living.

Gautama Buddha espoused simple living as a central virtue of Buddhism. The Four Noble Truths advocate detachment from desire as the path to ending suffering and attaining Nirvana.

Jesus is said to have lived a simple life. He is said to have encouraged his disciples &quot;to take nothing for their journey except a staff—no bread, no bag, no money in their belts—but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics&quot;. He also told his disciples that they cannot serve God and money at the same time, and explained that God is capable of providing them with the essentials for life (food and clothing), so long as they &quot;seek his kingdom first&quot;. The Apostle Paul taught that people should be content with food and clothing, and that the desire to be rich is the cause of many kinds of evils.

Many other notable religious individuals, such as Benedict of Nursia, Francis of Assisi, Leo Tolstoy, Rabindranath Tagore, Albert Schweitzer, and Mahatma Gandhi, have claimed that spiritual inspiration led them to a simple living lifestyle.
Sufism in the Muslim world emerged and grew as a mystical, somewhat hidden tradition in the mainstream Sunni and Shia denominations of Islam. Sufism grew particularly in the frontier areas of Islamic states, where the asceticism of its fakirs and dervishes appealed to populations already used to the monastic traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Christianity. Sufis were influential and successful in spreading Islam between the 10th and 19th centuries. Some scholars have argued that Sufi Muslim ascetics and mystics played a decisive role in converting the Turkic peoples to Islam, mainly because of the similarities between the extreme, ascetic Sufis (fakirs and dervishes) and the Shamans of the traditional Turco-Mongol religion.

Plain people typically belonged to Christian groups that practised lifestyles that excluded forms of wealth or technology for religious or philosophical reasons. Such Christian groups include the Shakers, Mennonites, Amish, Hutterites, Amana Colonies, Bruderhof, Old German Baptist Brethren, Harmony Society, and some Quakers. A Quaker belief called &quot;Testimony of simplicity&quot; states that a person ought to live her or his life simply. Some tropes about complete exclusion of technology in these groups may not be accurate though. The Amish and other groups do use some modern technology, after assessing its impact on the community.

The 18th-century French Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau strongly praised the simple way of life in many of his writings, especially in two books: &quot;Discourse on the Arts and Sciences&quot; (1750) and &quot;Discourse on Inequality&quot; (1754).

===Secular and political===
Epicureanism, based on the teachings of the Athens-based philosopher Epicurus, flourished from about to . Epicureanism held that the paradigm of happiness was the untroubled life, which was made possible by carefully considered choices. Epicurus pointed out that troubles entailed by maintaining an extravagant lifestyle tend to outweigh the pleasures of partaking in it. He therefore concluded that what is necessary for happiness, bodily comfort, and life itself should be maintained at minimal cost, while all things beyond what is necessary for these should either be tempered by moderation or completely avoided.
Henry David Thoreau, an American naturalist and author, made the classic secular advocacy of a life of simple and sustainable living in his book &quot;Walden&quot; (1854). Thoreau conducted a two-year experiment living a plain and simple life on the shores of Walden Pond. He concluded: &quot;Our life is frittered away by detail. Simplify, simplify, simplify! I say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumb-nail.&quot;

In Victorian Britain, Henry Stephens Salt, an admirer of Thoreau, popularised the idea of &quot;Simplification, the saner method of living&quot;. Other British advocates of the simple life included Edward Carpenter, William Morris, and the members of the &quot;Fellowship of the New Life&quot;. Carpenter popularised the phrase the &quot;Simple Life&quot; in his essay &quot;Simplification of Life&quot; in his &quot;England&#x27;s Ideal&quot; (1887).

C.R. Ashbee and his followers also practised some of these ideas, thus linking simplicity with the Arts and Crafts movement. British novelist John Cowper Powys advocated the simple life in his 1933 book &quot;A Philosophy of Solitude&quot;. John Middleton Murry and Max Plowman practised a simple lifestyle at their Adelphi Centre in Essex in the 1930s.
Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh championed a &quot;right simplicity&quot; philosophy based on ruralism in some of his work.

George Lorenzo Noyes, a naturalist, mineralogist, development critic, writer, and artist, is known as the Thoreau of Maine. He lived a wilderness lifestyle, advocating through his creative work a simple life and reverence for nature. During the 1920s and 1930s, the Vanderbilt Agrarians of the Southern United States advocated a lifestyle and culture centered upon traditional and sustainable agrarian values as opposed to the progressive urban industrialism which dominated the Western world at that time.
The Norwegian-American economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen warned against the conspicuous consumption of the materialistic society in his &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; (1899); Richard Gregg coined the term &quot;voluntary simplicity&quot; in &quot;The Value of Voluntary Simplicity&quot; (1936). From the 1920s, a number of modern authors articulated both the theory and practice of living simply, among them Gandhian Richard Gregg, economists Ralph Borsodi and Scott Nearing, anthropologist-poet Gary Snyder, and utopian fiction writer Ernest Callenbach. Economist E. F. Schumacher argued against the notion that &quot;bigger is better&quot; in &quot;Small Is Beautiful&quot; (1973); and Duane Elgin continued the promotion of the simple life in &quot;Voluntary Simplicity&quot; (1981).

The Australian academic Ted Trainer practices and writes about simplicity, and established The Simplicity Institute at Pigface Point, some from the University of New South Wales to which it is attached. A secular set of nine values was developed with the &quot;Ethify Yourself&quot; project in Austria, having a simplified life style in mind. In the United States voluntary simplicity started to garner more public exposure through a movement in the late 1990s around a popular &quot;simplicity&quot; book, &quot;The Simple Living Guide&quot; by Janet Luhrs.

==Practices==

===Reducing consumption, work time, and possessions===
Some people practice simple living by reducing their consumption. Lowering consumption can reduce individual debt, which allows for greater flexibility and simplicity in one&#x27;s life. If one spends less on goods or services, one can spend less time earning money. The time saved may be used to pursue other interests, to help others through volunteering, or to improve their quality of life, for example, by pursuing creative activities. Developing a detachment from the pursuit of money has led some individuals, such as Suelo and Mark Boyle, to live with no money. People who reduce their expenses can also increase their savings, leading to financial independence and the possibility of early retirement.

The &quot;100 Thing Challenge&quot; is a grassroots movement to whittle personal possessions to one hundred items, aiming of de-cluttering and simplify life. People in the tiny house movement chose to live in small, mortgage-free, low-impact dwellings, such as log cabins or beach huts.

Joshua Becker suggests that people who desire to simplify their lives begin by simplifying their homes.

===Increasing self-sufficiency===

Increased self-sufficiency reduces dependency on money and the broader economy. Tom Hodgkinson believes the key to a free and simple life is to stop consuming and start producing. Writer and eco-blogger Jennifer Nini left the city to live off-grid, grow food, and &quot;be a part of the solution; not part of the problem.&quot;

Forest gardening, developed by simple living adherent Robert Hart, is a low-maintenance, plant-based food production system based on woodland ecosystems. It incorporates fruit and nut trees, shrubs, herbs, vines, and perennial vegetables. Hart created a model forest garden from a orchard on his farm at Wenlock Edge in Shropshire.

&quot;Food miles&quot; is a description of the number of miles a given item of food or its ingredients has travelled between the farm and the table. Simple living advocates use this metric to argue for locally grown food, for example in books like &quot;The 100-Mile Diet&quot; and Barbara Kingsolver&#x27;s &quot;Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life&quot;. In each of those cases, the authors devoted a year to reducing their carbon footprint by eating locally.

City dwellers can produce home-grown fruit and vegetables in pot gardens or miniature indoor greenhouses. Tomatoes, lettuce, spinach, Swiss chard, peas, strawberries, and several types of herbs can all thrive in pots. Jim Merkel says &quot;A person could sprout seeds. They are tasty, incredibly nutritious, and easy to grow... We grow them in wide-mouthed mason jars with a square of nylon window screen screwed under a metal ring&quot;.

===Reconsidering technology===
People who practice simple living have diverse views on the role of technology. The American political activist Scott Nearing was skeptical about how humanity would use new technology, citing destructive inventions such as nuclear weapons. Those who eschew modern technology are often referred to as Luddites or neo-Luddites. Although simple living is often a secular pursuit, it may still involve reconsidering appropriate technology as Anabaptist groups such as the Amish or Mennonites have done.

Technology can make a simple lifestyle within mainstream culture easier and more sustainable. The internet can reduce an individual&#x27;s carbon footprint through remote work and lower paper usage. Some have calculated their energy consumption to show that one can live simply and in a satisfying way by using much less energy than is typically used in Western countries. Technologies they may embrace include computers, photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, and water turbines.

Technological interventions that appear to simplify living may actually induce side effects elsewhere or in the future. Evgeny Morozov warns that tools like the internet can facilitate mass surveillance and political repression. The book &quot;Green Illusions&quot; identifies how wind and solar energy technologies have hidden side effects and can actually increase energy consumption and entrench environmental harms over time. The authors of the book &quot;Techno-Fix&quot; criticize technological optimists for overlooking the limitations of technology in solving agricultural problems.

===Simplifying diet===

In contrast to diets like vegetarianism, a simplified diet focuses on principles rather than a set of rules. People may use less sophisticated and cheaper ingredients, and eat dishes considered as &quot;comfort food&quot;, including home-cooked dishes. Simple diets are usually considered to be &quot;healthy&quot;, since they include a significant amount of fruit and vegetables. A simple diet usually avoids highly processed foods and fast-food eating. Simplicity may also entail taking time to be present while eating, such as by following rituals, avoiding multitasking when eating, and putting time aside to consume food mindfully and gratefully, potentially in the company of others. Moreover, it is common to cook one&#x27;s own food, by following simple recipes that are not particularly time consuming, in an attempt to reduce the amount of energy necessary for cooking.

A simple diet looks different from person to person and can be adapted to suit individual needs and desires. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the Movement for Compassionate Living was formed by Kathleen and Jack Jannaway in 1984 to spread the message of veganism and promote simple living and self-reliance as a remedy against the exploitation of humans, animals, and the planet.

==Politics and activism==
===Environmentalism===
Environmentalism is inspired by simple living, as harmony with nature is intrinsically dependent on a simple lifestyle. For example, Green parties often advocate simple living as a consequence of their &quot;four pillars&quot; or the &quot;Ten Key Values&quot; of the Green Party of the United States. This includes, in policy terms, their rejection of genetic engineering and nuclear power and other technologies they consider to be hazardous. The Greens&#x27; support for simplicity is based on the reduction in natural resource usage and environmental impact. This concept is expressed in Ernest Callenbach&#x27;s &quot;green triangle&quot; of ecology, frugality, and health.

Some avoid involvement even with green politics as compromising simplicity, however, and instead advocate forms of green anarchism that attempt to implement these principles at a smaller scale, e.g. the ecovillage. Deep ecology, a belief that the world does not exist as a resource to be freely exploited by humans, proposes wilderness preservation, human population control, and simple living.

===Arts===
The term &quot;bohemianism&quot; describes a tradition of both voluntary and involuntary poverty by artists who devote their time to artistic endeavors rather than paid labor. The term was coined by the French bourgeoisie as a way to describe social non-conformists. Bohemians sometimes also expressed their unorthodoxy through simplistic art, for instance in the case of Amedeo Modigliani. Minimalistic art inspired &quot;rebel&quot; artistic movements into the 20th century.

Positive attitudes towards living in poverty for the sake of art are becoming less common among young American artists. One recent graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design said &quot;her classmates showed little interest in living in garrets and eating ramen noodles.&quot;

==Economics==
A new economics movement has been building since the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in 1972, and the publications that year of &quot;Only One Earth&quot;, &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot;, and &quot;Blueprint for Survival&quot;, followed by &quot;Small Is Beautiful: Economics As If People Mattered&quot; in 1973.

David Wann introduced the idea of &quot;simple prosperity&quot; as it applies to a sustainable lifestyle. From his point of view, &quot;it is important to ask ourselves three fundamental questions: what is the point of all our commuting and consuming? What is the economy for? And, finally, why do we seem to be unhappier now than when we began our initial pursuit for rich abundance?&quot;

James Robertson&#x27;s &quot;A New Economics of Sustainable Development&quot; inspired work of thinkers and activists who participate in his &quot;Working for a Sane Alternative&quot; network and program. According to Robertson, the shift to sustainability is likely to require a widespread shift of emphasis from raising incomes to reducing costs.

The principles of the new economics, as set out by Robertson, are the following:
* systematic empowerment of people (as opposed to making and keeping them dependent), as the basis for people-centred development
* systematic conservation of resources and the environment, as the basis for environmentally sustainable development
* evolution from a &quot;wealth of nations&quot; model of economic life to a one-world model, and from today&#x27;s inter-national economy to an ecologically sustainable, decentralising, multi-level one-world economic system
* restoration of political and ethical factors to a central place in economic life and thought
* respect for qualitative values, not just quantitative values

<text>Supachai Panitchpakdi (, , ; born 30 May 1946) is a Thai politician and professor. He was Secretary-General of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) from 1 September 2005 to 31 August 2013. Prior to this, he was the Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO) from 1 September 2002 to 1 September 2005. He was succeeded by Pascal Lamy.

== Education ==
Supachai studied in primary and secondary education at Saint Gabriel&#x27;s College and Triam Udom Suksa School. Then he received his master&#x27;s degree in economics, development planning, and his PhD in economic planning and development at the Netherlands School of Economics (now known as Erasmus University) in Rotterdam. In 1973, he completed his doctoral dissertation under supervision of Professor Jan Tinbergen, the first Nobel laureate in economics. In the same year, he went to Cambridge University as a visiting fellow to conduct research on development models.

== Political careers ==
In 1986 Supachai Panitchpakdi was appointed as Thailand&#x27;s Deputy Minister of Finance, but when parliament was dissolved in 1988 he left politics and became president of Thai Military Bank. In 1992 he returned to politics and became deputy prime minister until 1995, responsible for trade and economics. During the Asian financial crisis in November 1997 he returned to be deputy prime minister and also became minister of commerce.

==World Trade Organization==
On 22 July 1999 he was elected to become Director-General of the World Trade Organization, sharing the post with Mike Moore when a decision could not be reached. Taking the second half of the six-year term, he entered office on 1 September 2002.

==UNCTAD==
In March 2005 he was appointed Secretary-General of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) following his term at the WTO, a post he took up in late-2005. He was appointed for a second four-year term in September 2009. Keen to reform and revitalise the organisation, he has established a Panel of Eminent Persons to oversee the start of reform of UNCTAD.

==Selected works==
He published numerous books, including &quot;Educational Growth in Developing Countries&quot; (1974), &quot;Globalization and Trade in the New Millennium&quot; (2001) and &quot;China and the WTO: Changing China, Changing World Trade&quot; (2002, co-authored with Mark Clifford).

<doc id="206515" wikidata="Q609255" url="?curid=206515" title="Matsu Islands">
<text>The Matsu Islands ( or ), officially Lienchiang County (), are an archipelago of 36 islands and islets in the East China Sea governed by the Republic of China (Taiwan), situated alongside the southeastern coast of mainland China. The archipelago forms the smallest county in the ROC-controlled territories by area and population, as well as one of two counties that is a part of the nominal Fuchien Province.

The current Lienchiang County of the ROC was once part of an intact Lienchiang County of Fujian before its effective partition in 1949 following the Chinese Civil War, which resulted in the mainland portion of the county being controlled by the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), while the offshore islands of Matsu remained under ROC control. The circumstance has made the county the only former geographical unit with the same name that is now divided between the administrations of the ROC and the PRC.

==Name==
Lienchiang County, Taiwan (R.O.C.) uses the traditional Chinese characters name () and the romanized name Lienchiang which is derived from the Wade-Giles romanization (&quot;Lien²-chiang¹&quot;) of the Mandarin pronunciation for those Chinese characters that also refer to Lianjiang County, Fuzhou, Fujian in mainland China. Lienchiang has also been written as Lien-chiang and Lienkiang and by a postal romanization of the local language pronunciation Lienkong. The term Lienchiang can also refer to the homophonous Lianjiang in Zhanjiang, Guangdong, China.

The Matsu Islands are named after the main island, Nangan (Nankan). Nangan is also named Matsu Island because of a temple on the island which is supposed to be the burial site of the similarly named goddess Mazu (). Matsu is the Wade-Giles-derived romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation (&quot;Ma³-tsu³&quot;) for the Chinese character name () of the islands. The Matsu Islands are also known by other Chinese-language names including and ; Foochow Romanized: Mā-cū dō̤).

In April 2003, the Lienchiang County government considered changing the name of the county to Matsu County in order to avoid confusion with the nearby Lianjiang County on the mainland. Then-Magistrate Chen Hsueh-sheng said some local people opposed the name change because they felt it reflected the pro-independence viewpoint of the Democratic Progressive Party.

==History==

===Yuan dynasty===
Chinese from Fujian and Zhejiang started migrating to the islands during the Yuan dynasty. Most of the people on Matsu came from Houguan () (today Changle, Fujian). The popular net fishing industry established the base for development of Fuao settlement and industrial development of the region over several hundred years.

===Ming dynasty===
Some crewmen of Zheng He temporarily stayed on the islands.

===Qing dynasty===

During the early Qing dynasty, pirates gathered here and the residents left temporarily. In contrast with Taiwan and Penghu, the Matsu Islands were not ceded to the Japanese Empire via the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895. Due to its strategic location along the only route for the spice traffic, the British established the Dongyong Lighthouse in Dongyin Island in 1912 to facilitate ships navigation.

===Republic of China===
In 1911, the Qing dynasty was toppled after the Xinhai Revolution on 10 October 1911 and the Republic of China (ROC) was established on 1 January 1912. Matsu Islands were subsequently governed under the administration of Fukien Province of the ROC. On 1 August 1927, the Nanchang Uprising broke out between the ruling Nationalist Party of China (KMT) and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) which marked the beginning of Chinese Civil War.

Sheng-Chang Lin, a graduate student writing for the University of Nottingham Taiwan Studies Programme, noted that in the pre-1949 period, the Matsu Islands did not have a significant relationship with Taiwan, which at the time was a colony of the Empire of Japan. Additionally, he stated that the islands at the time had separate identities and did not have a collective identity as the Matsu Islands. Previous groups of islanders perceived themselves as Fujianese.

On 10 September 1937, Japan occupied Beigan and Nangan via the Collaborationist Chinese Army, making the islands the first in Fujian to fall to Japan. The islands were not occupied by Japanese troops during World War II because they were not important militarily. The Lienchiang County seat was moved to Danyang Township on 19 April 1941 until the Japanese surrender on August 15, 1945.

As a result of the Chinese Civil War, in 1949 the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) took over mainland China from the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang, KMT). The CCP established the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) on 1 October 1949, which included administration of today&#x27;s Lianjiang County of Fujian. The KMT retreated from mainland China to Taiwan at the end of 1949, but retained some of the offshore parts of Lienchiang County (namely, the Matsu Islands), and also most of Kinmen County (Quemoy). On 15 December 1950, the Matsu Administrative Office () of Fujian Province, Republic of China, was established, including modern-day Lienchiang County (the Matsu Islands), as well as several islands in present-day Haidao Township (Xiapu County) and Taishan () (Fuding County) which were lost to the PRC in 1950 and 1951.

In early July 1953, Chinese Nationalist guerillas retreated from islands in the Xiyang Island (Chihchutao) area of present-day Haidao Township (PRC), and the area came under the control of the PRC. In June 1955, the PRC undertook considerable road and military construction around Haitan Island, Pingtan County, Fuzhou, Fujian, China, including roads leading to possible artillery positions on the mainland. Those positions might have been used to protect the Haitan Strait, which was considered a favorable staging area for amphibious operations against the Matsu Islands. In July 1958, the PRC began massing forces opposite Kinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu (Lienchiang) and began bombarding them on 23 August, triggering the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis. On 4 September 1958, the PRC announced the extension of its territorial waters by 20 kilometres (12 mi) to include the two islands. However, later that month, after talks between the United States and the PRC in Warsaw, Poland, a ceasefire was agreed and the status quo reaffirmed.

The phrase &quot;Quemoy and Matsu&quot; became part of American political language in the 1960 U.S. presidential election. During the debates, both candidates, Vice President Richard Nixon and Senator John F. Kennedy, pledged to use American forces if necessary to protect Taiwan from invasion by the PRC, which the United States did not recognize as the legitimate government of China. However, in the second debate on 7 October 1960, the two candidates stated different opinions about whether American forces should also be used to protect Taiwan&#x27;s forward positions, Quemoy and Matsu. Senator Kennedy stated that these islands — as little as 9 kilometres (5.5 mi) off the coast of China and as much as 170 kilometres (106 mi) from Taiwan — were strategically indefensible and were not essential to the defense of Taiwan. Vice President Nixon maintained that, since Quemoy and Matsu were in the &quot;area of freedom&quot;, they should not, as a matter of principle, be surrendered to the Communists.

Earlier in the debate, Nixon said:
Later in the debate, Edward P. Morgan asked Senator Kennedy:
Kennedy&#x27;s response was:
Vice President Nixon retorted:


After the third debate on 13 October 1960, Kennedy&#x27;s advisers spoke with then Secretary of State Herter and said that Kennedy was willing to revise his position on the Quemoy and Matsu issue so as not to give the Communists the impression that the United States would not stand united against aggression. Nixon pointed out the change in Kennedy&#x27;s position but decided not to press the point due to the importance of the United States&#x27; role in what was an extremely tense situation. Polls of Republicans and Democrats showed overwhelming support for Nixon&#x27;s position.

Sheng-Chang Lin stated that the Matsu Islands gained a collective identity during the Cold War period. Additionally, the islands gained significant relationships to Taiwan, now sharing a government with them. By 2021, younger people identified as being from the Matsu Islands specifically.

Self-governance of the county resumed in 1992, after the cessation of political warfare with the mainland and the abolition of Battle Field Administration on 7 November 1992. Afterwards, local construction picked up pace. In 1999, the islands were designated as the Matsu National Scenic Area Administration. In January 2001, direct cargo and passenger shipping started between Matsu and Fujian Province of the PRC. After 1 January 2015, tourists from mainland China could directly apply the Exit and Entry Permit upon arrival in Matsu Islands. That privilege also applied to Penghu and Kinmen, as a means to boost tourism in the outlying islands of Taiwan. In December 2015, the Huangqi-Matsu ship route was introduced as part of the Mini Three Links.

In 2020, rampant illegal sand mining by Chinese ships in the waters around the Matsu Islands caused concern in the islands and in the Executive Yuan about damage to the marine environment, possible damage to underwater telecommunications cables, and the potential for coastal erosion. Auctioning impounded ships was seen as an easy way for the dredging companies to get their ships back via intermediaries, hence sinking the impounded ships was under consideration.

In 2021, it was reported that hundreds of Chinese squid fishing boats surrounded Matsu, and the lights from the boats to attract the squid lit up the local sky in green at night.

In February 2023, two submarine cables between Matsu and Taiwan island were completely cut, causing Matsu residents&#x27; communication services to be affected.

==Geography==

The Matsu Islands comprise 19 islands and islets, which include five major islands, which are Nangan, Dongju and Xiju (both in Juguang Township), Beigan and Dongyin. Minor islands include Liang Island, Gaodeng Island, Daqiu Island and Xiaoqiu, which are part of Beigan Township. The shortest distance between Huangqi, Lianjiang County and the Matsu Islands is also the shortest distance between China (PRC) administered territory and territory in the ROC (Taiwan)-administered Matsu Islands.

Dongyin is the northernmost and Dongju is the southernmost.

* Dongyin is 100 nautical miles (190 km) from Keelung, Taiwan, 180 to the Penghu islands, and slightly over 10 nautical miles (19 km) from mainland China.
* The soil is not ideal for farming.
* The highest point is on Beigan, 298 metres (978&#x27;).

* Nangan: 
* Beigan: 
* Dongyin: 
* Juguang islands: see Juguang

=== Geology ===
The islands are predominantly composed of Jurassic and Cretaceous intrusive (emplaced ≈160 Ma, ≈130 Ma and ≈94 Ma) granite and diabase.

===Climate===
Average annual temperature is 18.6 °C (65 °F), with the average low being at 13 °C (55 °F) and average high at 29 °C (85 °F). The daily temperature varies greatly during day and night. The region experiences subtropical maritime climate (&quot;Cfa&quot; according to the Köppen climate classification), which is influenced by monsoon and ocean currents and its geographic location. Matsu has four seasons: during winter it is cold, cloudy, and wet, during summer and spring it is foggy, and during autumn the weather is generally stable.

==Politics and government==


The Matsu Islands are administered as Lienchiang County under the Fujian Provincial Government. Nangan Township is the county seat which houses the Lienchiang County Government and Lienchiang County Council. The county is headed by a magistrate, elected every four years in the ROC local elections. The incumbent magistrate is Wang Chung-ming of Kuomintang. The Lienchiang County Council seat is dominated by Kuomintang legislators.

===Administrative divisions===
Lienchiang County is divided into four rural townships. It is further divided into 22 villages and 137 neighborhoods (鄰). Lienchiang County is the only county in Taiwan which does not have a city or an urban township. The county seat is Nangan Township (Nankan).

All the townships administer more than one island.

===Magistrates===
Before 1993, county magistrates were appointed.
*Elected magistrates
# Tsao Chang-Shun () (1993–1997) (KMT)
# Liu Li-Chun () (1997–2001) (KMT)
# Chen Hsueh-sheng, also the current national representative of Matsu. (2001–2009) (PFP, later KMT)
# Yang Sui-sheng (2009–2014) (KMT)
# Liu Cheng-ying (2014–2022) (KMT)
# Wang Chung-ming (2022–present) (KMT)

===Military===
The Matsu Islands are protected by the .

===Politics===
Lienchang County voted one Kuomintang legislator out of one seat to be in the Legislative Yuan during the 2016 Republic of China legislative election.
While the Democratic Progressive Party have had difficulty winning a county-level election in this area, most of the competitions are among local strategies. In 2018, a Green Party member, attempted to run for magistrate but failed.

===Cross-Strait relations===
 The PRC claims the three northern townships of the Matsu Islands as &quot;Matsu Township&quot; (; Mā-cū hiŏng) and the Juguang Islands (the southernmost islands, formerly named the Baiquan Islands) as part of Changle District.

Vessels from the Taiwan&#x27;s Coast Guard Administration (CGA) have confronted sand dredging by Chinese vessels near the Matsu Islands. This dredging activity began in 2018. Since March 2019, the Lienchiang Cross-Strait Matters Forum started as an official forum between Lienchiang County of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and Lianjiang County of the People&#x27;s Republic of China to discuss matters regarding the two sides.

==Demographics and culture==
===Population===
The majority of native Matsu Islands residents originated from Northern Fujian. Several of the islands of Matsu are not inhabited permanently. Some of these are garrisoned by soldiers from the Republic of China Armed Forces stationed in the county since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and during the First and Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1954 and 1958 respectively. Due to that high military demand large numbers of military personnel stationed on the islands produced unprecedented population growth in the county. The population reached its peak in 1971 with a total of 17,088 people. After those periods of high growth the population decreased year after year due to the poor economic growth which resulted in mass youth emigration due to lack of employment opportunities. In recent years the population in the county has gradually increased because of immigration. The population has stabilized due to the improved transportation between Taiwan Island and Matsu Islands as well as mass construction projects.

===Languages===
The native language spoken by Matsu residents is the Matsu dialect, a subdialect of the Fuzhou dialect, which is one of the statutory languages for public transport announcements in the Matsu Islands. Mandarin Chinese is one of the official languages of Lienchiang County.

Previously the Eastern Min varieties in the Matsu Islands were seen as a part of general Fujian varieties. The establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949 severed the Matsu Islands from the rest of Fujian province, and as communications were cut off between the Republic of China (now including Taiwan and without mainland China) and the PRC, the identity of the Matsu Islands specifically became established. Additionally, the varieties of Eastern Min on the Matsu Islands became seen as a Matsu dialect.

===Name===
Chen (陳) is the most common surname, then Lin (林), Wang (王), Tsao (曹) and Liu (劉).

===Belief===
Matsu, though named after the goddess Matsu, is written with a different character that has a different tone. But the Matsu Islands are not the birthplace of the goddess as the human Lin Muoniang - Meizhou Island is — but her death place (on a seaport named after her on Nangan Island).

The Matsu Nangan Tianhou Temple (), a temple dedicated to the goddess, contains the sarcophagus of Lin Muoniang. It is, however, not as popular as the Meizhou temple.

Most Taiwanese pilgrims to Meizhou start off their journey in the Matsu Islands because they are the closest ROC-controlled territory to Meizhou, which is controlled by the PRC.

==Economy==
Due to its geographically remote location, the manufacturing business of Matsu has never been fully developed. Among them, the wine making industry of Matsu Distillery is the most distinguished feature. Tourism has become a highly important feature of the economy.

However, most of its commercial trading focuses on retail businesses and restaurants for stationed military consumption. Farm products of Matsu include rice, sugar cane, tea plant, oranges. Sea animals, such as fish, clams, and jellyfish, are also popular exports due to its nature as the major traditional industry in Matsu. However, the flourishing fishing ground is almost exhausted by arbitrary fish bombing by mainland China fishing boats, while the fish population is decreasing as well.

In July 2012, Matsu residents voted in favor of the establishment of casinos, which led to the prospect of gaming industries in the county and the passing of the Gaming Act ().

==Infrastructure==
===Power generation===
On 1 July 1975, the Matsu Power Company was founded to operate all of the power plants in the county. On 1 July 1986, the company was incorporated into Taiwan Power Company. The county is powered up by its fuel-fired (diesel) Zhushan Power Plant located in Cingshuei Village of Nangan Township with a capacity of 15.4 MW commissioned on 22 March 2010. The other power plants are Beigan Power Plant in Beigan Township, Dongyin Power Plant in Dongyin Township and Dongju Power Plant in Dongju Island and Xiju Power Plant in Xiju Island of Juguang Township. The county is also powered up by its photovoltaic system with a capacity of 0.074 MW.

===Telecommunication===
For telecommucation, Matsu Islands is connected via three submarine communications cables named Taima Cables (). To Taiwan Island, the Taima Cable No. 2 connects Dongyin Township in the county to Tamsui District in New Taipei and Taima Cable No. 3 connects Nangan Township to Taoyuan City. As of 2023, the fourth cable is under construction with expected completion date in 2025. The first cable is no longer in use.

===Pollution===
Generally, the environment of Matsu Islands is still well-preserved. The major source of pollution is from family and military household waste. There are, however, concerns that the continued lack of modern sewage facilities results in household waste seeping into groundwater.

==Tourism==

Tourism has become a critical sector in the local economy. Lienchiang County Government is making an effort to attract more visitors to the Matsu Islands, especially among foreigners. Dongyin Visitor Center is the main visitor center of the township.

Nangan is the capital of Matsu and it is noted for its granite tunnel and the Iron Fort. It has two interconnected main roads.

The Beihai Tunnels are manmade granite tunnels. Both tunnels were remarkable for their time, and they took great effort to construct. The tunnel in Nangan was built in 1968. The completion of Beihai Tunnel took the effort of thousands of men. The 700 metre (800 yard) tunnel has a width of 10 metres (33&#x27;) and a height of 16 metres (52&#x27;). It was completed in 820 days with shovels, spades and explosives; the tunnel also took the life of a platoon of soldiers. The tunnel was considered a military location and was not opened to the public until 1990.

The Iron Fort is located on the Southwest side of Nangan island. Located by a small cliff, it is a vulnerable spot for outside attacks or illegal smuggling of materials. With that in mind, the fort was built for defence. It is equipped with multiple machinegun rooms and rudimentary living facilities. It is now open to the public, and although most of the equipment has been removed from the site, the site itself brings back a vivid image of what it was like for soldiers at that time.

Museums in Matsu including the Matsu Blue Tears Ecological Museum, Matsu Folk Culture Museum, Ching-kuo Memorial Hall and War and Peace Memorial Park Exhibition Center.

===Nature===
Since 1990, the county manages the , which spreads across eight islands and islets in Nangan, Beigan and Tongyin Townships. It contains 30 species in 15 orders, mostly gulls and terns. In 2000, four pairs of the critically endangered Chinese crested tern, previously thought to be extinct, were discovered nesting on the Matsu Islands, giving them global conservation importance.

There are also mosses and ferns rare or absent elsewhere in the ROC.

Cetacean species that have become rare along Chinese coasts are still present here such as false killer whales and finless porpoises, providing opportunistic observations at times. Finless porpoises in this areas are generally smaller than other subspecies, and it is unique that two subspecies inhabit in this region where Matsu region is the northern limit for one of them.

==Transportation==

===Air===
Both Nangan and Beigan have airports which are the Matsu Nangan Airport and Matsu Beigan Airport respectively. Dongyin and Juguang (in Xiju Island) house heliports which only operate during winter time and priority is given to local residents to travel to Nangan.

===Sea===
Due to the main airport being located in Nangan, boats are the main form of transportation between the islands in the county.

There are two ferry rides to mainland China. One arrives at Mawei District of Fuzhou and departs from Fuao Harbor at Nangan Township in which the journey normally takes 90 minutes while in Nangan. Another arrives at Huangqi () of Lianjiang and departs from Beigan Township in which the journey takes only 20 minutes. Dongyin Township houses the Zhongzhu Harbor.

===Road===
Due to their size, travelling by motorized scooter is an ideal way to get around the main islands such as Nangan and Beigan, despite the steep hills. Both Islands have regular buses, and taxis are also economical. In October 2019, mainland China announced &#x27;initial plans&#x27; to build a bridge linking Fuzhou to the Matsu Islands. Taiwan&#x27;s Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said that the plans were made unilaterally by Mainland&#x27;s Fujian as part of its schemes to absorb Taiwan and divide Taiwanese society and that they see no need for bridges linking either Matsu or Kinmen to mainland China. Legislators representing Matsu have said that their thinking is different from the Mainland Affairs Council, and that they were optimistic about the idea of a bridge.

<text>Juliane &quot;Liane&quot; Haid (16 August 1895 – 28 November 2000) was an Austrian actress and singer. She has often been referred to as Austria&#x27;s first movie star.

==Biography==
Juliane Haid was born in Vienna on 16 August 1895, the first child to Georg Haid (1864–1951) and Juliane Haid (1873–1939). She had two younger sisters, Grit (1900– 1938), who also became an actress, and Johanna (1903–1964).

Haid trained both as a dancer and singer and became the epitome of the &quot;Süßes Wiener Mädel&quot; (&quot;Sweet Viennese Girl&quot;) and a popular pin-up throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Her first motion picture was a propaganda film made during the First World War, &quot;Mit Herz und Hand fürs Vaterland&quot; (1916). She worked for UFA and, as a trained singer, easily made the transition to the sound era, appearing in comedy films alongside Austrian and German stars such as Willi Forst, Bruno Kastner, Georg Alexander, Theo Lingen, and Heinz Rühmann. Her first husband, Baron Fritz von Haymerle, helped her found her film company, Micco-Film.

Having refused several offers from Hollywood, she left Germany for Switzerland in 1942 &quot;because of the regime, because everything was bombed, and because all the good directors had left&quot;. She married Carl Spycher and ended her film career. Spycher adopted Liane&#x27;s son, Pierre (born 1940), who was the result of her second marriage to Hans Somborn.

Her notable films include &quot;Lady Hamilton&quot; (1921; her breakthrough role); &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot; (1922); &quot;The Csardas Princess&quot; (1927, based on the operetta by Emmerich Kálmán); and the talkies &quot;The Song Is Ended&quot; (1930) and &quot;Ungeküsst soll man nicht schlafen gehn&quot; (1936). She made her last film appearance in 1953. Haid died in Bern, Switzerland in 2000.

<text>John Frederick Denison Maurice (29 August 1805 – 1 April 1872) was an English Anglican theologian, a prolific author, and one of the founders of Christian socialism. Since the Second World War, interest in Maurice has expanded.

==Early life and education==
John Frederick Denison Maurice was born in Normanston, Lowestoft, Suffolk, on 29 August 1805, the only son of Michael Maurice and his wife, Priscilla. Michael Maurice was the evening preacher in a Unitarian chapel. Deaths in the family brought about changes in the family&#x27;s &quot;religious convictions&quot; and &quot;vehement disagreement&quot; between family members. Maurice later wrote about these disagreements and their effect on him:
Michael was &quot;of no little learning&quot; and gave his son his early education. The son &quot;appears to have been an exemplary child, responsive to teaching and always dutiful. He read a good deal on his own account, but had little inclination for games. Serious and precocious, he even at this time harboured ambitions for a life of public service.&quot;

For his higher education in civil law, Maurice entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1823 which required no religious test for admissions though only members of the established church were eligible to obtain a degree. With John Sterling Maurice founded the Apostles&#x27; Club. He moved to Trinity Hall in 1825. In 1826, Maurice went to London to read for the bar and returned to Cambridge where he obtained a first-class degree in civil law in 1827.

During the 1827–1830 break in his higher education, Maurice lived in London and Southampton. While in London, he contributed to the &quot;Westminster Review&quot; and made the acquaintance of John Stuart Mill. With Sterling, he also edited the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;. The magazine did not pay and his father had lost money which entailed moving the family to a smaller house in Southampton and Maurice joined them. During his time in Southampton, Maurice rejected his earlier Unitarianism and decided to be ordained in the Church of England. Mill described Maurice and Sterling as representing &quot;a second Liberal and even Radical party, on totally different grounds from Benthamism.&quot; Maurice&#x27;s articles evince sympathy for Radicals such as Leigh Hunt and William Hazlitt, and he welcomed the &quot;shattering of thrones, the convulsions of governments&quot; that marked the end of the eighteenth century. He likewise commended the Whig Henry Brougham&#x27;s support for Catholic emancipation in England, but criticized him for relying too much on the aristocracy and not enough on the people.

Maurice entered Exeter College, Oxford, in 1830 to prepare for ordination. He was older than most of the students, he was very poor and he &quot;kept to himself, toiling at his books&quot;. However, &quot;his honesty and intellectual powers&quot; impressed others. In March 1831, Maurice was baptised in the Church of England. After taking a second-class degree in November 1831, he worked as a &quot;private tutor&quot; in Oxford until his ordination as a deacon in January 1834 and appointment to a curacy in Bubbenhall near Leamington. Being twenty-eight years old when he was ordained deacon, Maurice was older and with a wider experience than most ordinands. He had attended both universities and been active in &quot;the literary and social interests of London&quot;. All this, coupled with his diligence in study and reading, gave Maurice a knowledge &quot;scarcely paralleled by any of his contemporaries&quot;. He was ordained as priest in 1835.

==Career and marriages==
Except for his 1834–1836 first clerical assignment, Maurice&#x27;s career can be divided between his conflicted years in London (1836–1866) and his peaceful years in Cambridge (1866–1872)

For his first clerical assignment, Maurice served as an assistant curacy in Bubbenhall in Warwickshire from 1834 until 1836. During his time in Bubbenhall, Maurice began writing on the topic of &quot;moral and metaphysical philosophy&quot;. Writing on this topic by &quot;revision and expansion&quot; continued the rest of his life until the publication of &quot;Moral and Metaphysical Philosophy, 2 vols&quot; in 1871–1872, the year of his death. Also, Maurice&#x27;s novel &quot;Eustace Conway&quot;, begun , was published in 1834 and was praised by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

In 1836, he was appointed chaplain of Guy&#x27;s Hospital where he took up residence and &quot;lectured the students on moral philosophy&quot;. He continued this post until 1860. Maurice&#x27;s public life began during his years at Guy&#x27;s.

In June 1837, Maurice met Anna Eleanor Barton, a daughter of General Charles Barton. They became engaged and were married on 7 October 1837.

In 1838, the first edition of &quot;The Kingdom of Christ&quot; was published. It was &quot;one of his most significant works&quot;. A second enlarged edition was published in 1842 and a third edition in 1883. For Maurice the signs of this kingdom are &quot;the sacraments of baptism and the eucharist, to which must be added the creeds, the liturgy, the episcopate, and the scriptures—in fact, all the marks of catholicity as exemplified in the Church of England.&quot; The book was met with criticism when published, a criticism &quot;that lasted throughout Maurice&#x27;s career.&quot;

===London===
Maurice served as editor of the &quot;Educational Magazine&quot; during its entire 1839–1841 existence. He argued that &quot;the school system should not be transferred from the church to the state&quot;. Maurice was elected professor of English literature and history at King&#x27;s College, London, in 1840. When the college added a theological department in 1846, he became a professor there also. That same year Maurice was elected chaplain of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and resigned the chaplaincy at Guy&#x27;s Hospital.

In 1845, Maurice was made both the Boyle lecturer by the Archbishop of York&#x27;s nomination and the Warburton lecturer by the Archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s nomination. He held these chairs until 1853.

Maurice&#x27;s wife, Anna, died on 25 March 1845, leaving two sons, one of whom was Frederick Maurice who wrote his father&#x27;s biography.

Queen&#x27;s College
During his London years, Maurice engaged in two lasting educational initiatives: founding Queen&#x27;s College, London in 1848 and the Working Men&#x27;s College in 1854.

In 1847, Maurice and &quot;most of his brother-professors&quot; at King&#x27;s College formed a Committee on Education for the education of governesses. This committee joined a scheme for establishing a College for Women that resulted in the founding of Queen&#x27;s College. Maurice was its first principal. The college was &quot;empowered to grant certificates of qualification &#x27;to governesses&#x27; and &#x27;to open classes in all branches of female education&#x27;.&quot;

One of the early graduates of Queen&#x27;s College who was influenced by Maurice was Matilda Ellen Bishop who became the first Principal of Royal Holloway College.

On 4 July 1849, Maurice remarried, this time to Georgina Hare-Naylor.

Dismissed from King&#x27;s College
&quot;Maurice was dismissed from his professorships because of his leadership in the Christian Socialist Movement, and because of the supposed unorthodoxy of his &quot;Theological Essays&quot; (1853).&quot; His work &quot;The Kingdom of Christ&quot; had evoked virulent criticism. The publication of his &quot;Theological Essays&quot; in 1853 evoked even more and precipitated his dismissal from King&#x27;s College. At the instigation of Richard William Jelf, the Principal of the College, the Council of the College asked Maurice to resign. He refused and demanded that he be either &quot;acquitted or dismissed.&quot; He was dismissed. To prevent the controversy from affecting Queen&#x27;s College, Maurice &quot;severed his relations&quot; with it.

The public and his friends were strongly in support of Maurice. His friends &quot;looked up to him with the reverence due to a great spiritual teacher&quot;. They were devoted to him and wanted to protect Maurice against his opponents.

Working Men&#x27;s College
Although his relations with King&#x27;s College and Queen&#x27;s College had been severed, Maurice continued to work for the education of workers. In February 1854, he developed plans for a Working Men&#x27;s College. Maurice gained enough support for the college by giving lectures that by 30 October 1854, the college opened with over 130 students. &quot;Maurice became principal, and took an active part both in teaching and superintending during the rest of his life in London.&quot;

Maurice&#x27;s teaching led to some &quot;abortive attempts at co-operation among working men&quot; and to the more enduring Christian Socialism movement and the Society for Promoting Working Men&#x27;s Associations.

During the invasion scare of 1859–60, Thomas Hughes raised the 19th (Bloomsbury) Middlesex Rifle Volunteer Corps from among the students of the Working Men&#x27;s College, and Denison became the battalion&#x27;s Honorary Chaplain on 7 December 1860.

In July 1860, in spite of controversy, Maurice was appointed to the benefice of the chapel of St Peter, Vere Street, Marylebone. He held the position until 1869.

===Cambridge University===
&quot;On 25 October 1866 Maurice was elected to the Knightbridge professorship of casuistry, moral theology, and moral philosophy at [the University of] Cambridge.&quot; This professorship was the &quot;highest preferment&quot; Maurice attained. Among his books he cited in his application, were his &quot;Theological Essays&quot; and &quot;What is Revelation?&quot; that had evoked opposition elsewhere. But at Cambridge, Maurice was &quot;almost unanimously elected&quot; to the faculty. Maurice was &quot;warmly received&quot; at Cambridge, where &quot;there were no doubts of his sufficient orthodoxy&quot;.

While teaching at Cambridge, Maurice continued as the Working Men&#x27;s College principal, though he was there less often. At first, he retained the Vere Street, London, curacy which entailed a weekly rail trip to London to officiate at services and preach. When this proved too strenuous, upon medical advice, Maurice resigned this curacy in October 1869. In 1870, by accepting the offer of St Edward&#x27;s, Cambridge, where he had &quot;an opportunity for preaching to an intelligent audience&quot; with few pastoral duties, albeit with no stipend.

In July 1871 Maurice accepted the Cambridge preachership at Whitehall. &quot;He was a man to whom other men, no matter how much they might differ from him, would listen.&quot;

Royal Commissioner

In spite of declining health, in 1870 Maurice agreed to serve on the Royal Commission regarding the Contagious Diseases Act of 1871, and travelled to London for the meetings. &quot;The Commission consisted of twenty-three men, including ten parliamentarians (from both Houses), some clergy, and some eminent scientists (such as T.H. Huxley).&quot;

Dean Francis Close wrote a monograph about the proceedings of the royal commission. The issue was whether earlier acts legalising and policing prostitution for the armed forces should be repealed. Close quoted a commission member&#x27;s speech to the House of Commons that praised Maurice as a &quot;model Royal Commissioner&quot;. Close ended his monograph with these words: &quot;Professor Maurice remained firmly and conscientiously opposed to the Acts to the very last.&quot;
Final years

In spite of terminal illness, Maurice continued giving his professorial lectures, trying to know his students personally and completing his &quot;Metaphysical and Moral Philosophy&quot; (2 vols., 1871–1872). He also continued preaching (at Whitehall from November 1871 to January 1872 and two university sermons in November). His final sermon was 11 February 1872 in St Edward&#x27;s. On 30 March he resigned from St Edward&#x27;s. Very weak and mentally depressed, on Easter Monday, 1 April 1872, after receiving Holy Communion, with great effort he pronounced the blessing, became unconscious and died.

===Conflicting opinions of Maurice&#x27;s thinking===
In a letter of 2 April 1833 to Richard Chenevix Trench, Maurice lamented the current &quot;spirit&quot; of &quot;conflicting opinions&quot; that &quot;cramps our energies&quot; and &quot;kills our life&quot;. In spite of his lamenting &quot;contradictory opinions&quot;, that term precisely described reactions to Maurice.

Maurice&#x27;s writings, lectures, and sermons spawned conflicting opinions. Julius Hare considered him &quot;the greatest mind since Plato&quot;, but John Ruskin thought him &quot;by nature puzzle-headed and indeed wrong-headed;&quot; while John Stuart Mill considered that &quot;there was more intellectual power wasted in Maurice than in any other of my contemporaries&quot;.

Hugh Walker in a study of Victorian literature found other examples of conflicting opinions.
* Charles Kingsley pronounced Maurice &quot;a great and rare thinker&quot;.
* Aubrey Thomas de Vere compared listening to Maurice to &quot;eating pea-soup with a fork&quot;.
* Matthew Arnold spoke of Maurice as &quot;always beating the bush with profound emotion, but never starting the hare&quot;.

One important literary and theological figure who was favourably impressed by Maurice was Charles Dodgson, also known as Lewis Carroll. Dodgson wrote about attending morning and afternoon services at Vere Street at which Maurice preached both times with the comment, &quot;I like his sermons very much&quot;. Maurice held the benefice of St Peter&#x27;s, Vere Street from 1860 to 1869.

M. E. Grant Duff in his diary for 22 April 1855, wrote that he &quot;went, as usual about this time, to hear F. D. Maurice preach at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. I suppose I must have heard him, first and last, some thirty or forty times, and never carried away one clear idea, or even the impression that he had more than the faintest conception of what he himself meant.&quot;

John Henry Newman described Maurice as a man of &quot;great power&quot; and of &quot;great earnestness&quot;. However, Newman found Maurice so &quot;hazy&quot; that he &quot;lost interest in his writings&quot;.

In the United States, &quot;The National Quarterly Review and Religious Magazine, Volume 38&quot; (January 1879), contained this appreciation of Maurice.
&quot;Mr. Maurice&#x27;s characteristics are well known and becoming every year more highly appreciated—broad catholicity, keenness of insight, powerful mental grasp, fearlessness of utterance and devoutness of spirit.&quot;

Leslie Stephen in &quot;The English Utilitarians&quot;, Vol. 3, John Stuart Mill. (1900), wrote &quot;Maurice is equally opposed to the sacerdotalism which makes the essence of religion consist in a magical removal of penalties instead of a &#x27;regeneration&#x27; of the nature. He takes what may be vaguely called the &#x27;subjective&#x27; view of religion, and sympathises with Schleiermacher&#x27;s statement that piety is &#x27;neither a knowing nor a doing, but an inclination and determination of the feelings&#x27; &quot;.

==Social activism==

&quot;The demand for political and economic righteousness is one of the principal themes of Maurice&#x27;s theology.&quot; Maurice practised his theology by going &quot;quietly on bearing the chief burthen of some of the most important social movements of the time.&quot;

Living in London the &quot;condition of the poor pressed upon him with consuming force&quot;. Working men trusted him when they distrusted other clergymen and the church. Working men attended Bible classes and meetings led by Maurice whose theme was &quot;moral edification&quot;.

===Christian socialism===
Maurice was affected by the &quot;revolutionary movements of 1848&quot;, especially the march on Parliament, but he believed that &quot;Christianity rather than secularist doctrines was the only sound foundation for social reconstruction&quot;.

Maurice &quot;disliked competition as fundamentally unchristian, and wished to see it, at the social level, replaced by co-operation, as expressive of Christian brotherhood.&quot; In 1849, Maurice joined other Christian socialists in an attempt to mitigate competition by the creation of co-operative associations. He viewed cooperative societies as &quot;a modern application of primitive Christian communism&quot;. Twelve cooperative workshops were to be launched in London. However, even with subsidy by Edward Vansittart Neale many turned out to be unprofitable. Nevertheless, the effort affected lasting consequences as seen in the following sub-section on the &quot;Society for Promoting Working Men&#x27;s Associations.&quot;

In 1854, there were eight Co-operative Productive Associations in London and fourteen in the Provinces. These included breweries, flour mills, tailors, hat makers, builders, printers, and engineers. Others were formed in the following decades. Some of them failed after several years, some lasted a longer time, and some were replaced.

Maurice&#x27;s perception of a need for a moral and social regeneration of society led him into Christian socialism. From 1848 until 1854 (when the movement came to an end), he was a leader of the Christian Socialist Movement. He insisted that &quot;Christianity is the only foundation of Socialism, and that a true Socialism is the necessary result of a sound Christianity.&quot;

Maurice has been characterized as &quot;the &quot;spiritual&quot; leader&quot; of the Christian socialists because he was more interested in disseminating its theological foundations than &quot;their practical endeavours.&quot; Maurice once wrote,Let people call me merely a philosopher, or merely anything else... My business, because I am a theologian, and have no vocation except for theology, is not to build, but to dig, to show that economics and politics ... must have a ground beneath themselves, and that society was not to be made by any arrangements of ours, but is to be regenerated by finding the law and ground of its order and harmony, the only secret of its existence, in God.

===Society for Promoting Working Men&#x27;s Associations===
Early in 1850, the Christian socialists started a working men&#x27;s association for tailors in London, followed by associations for other trades. To promote this movement, a Society for Promoting Working Men&#x27;s Associations (SPWMA) was founded with Maurice as a founding member and head of its central board. At first, the SPWMA&#x27;s work was merely propagating the idea of associations by publishing tracts. Then it undertook the practical project of establishing the Working Men&#x27;s College because educated workers were essential for successful co-operative societies. With that ingredient more of the associations succeeded; others still failed or were replaced by a later cooperative movement. The lasting legacy of the Christian socialists was that, in 1852, they influenced the passage of an act in Parliament which gave &quot;a legal status to co-operative bodies&quot; such as working men&#x27;s associations. The SPWMA &quot;flourished in the years from 1849 to 1853, or thereabouts.&quot;

The original mission of the SPWMA was &quot;to diffuse the principles of co-operation as the practical application of Christianity to the purposes of trade and industry&quot;. The goal was forming associations by which working men and their families could enjoy &quot;the whole produce of their labour&quot;.

In testimony from representatives of &quot;Co-operative Societies&quot; during 1892–1893 to the Royal Commission on Labour for the House of Commons, one witness applauded the contribution of Christian socialists to the &quot;present cooperative movement&quot; by their formulating the idea in the 1850s. The witness specifically cited &quot;Maurice, Kingsley, Ludlow, Neale, and Hughes&quot;.

==Legacy==

That Maurice left a legacy that would be valued by many was harbingered by responses to his death on 1 April 1872. He was buried on the west side of Highgate Cemetery and &quot;crowds following his remains to their last resting place, and around the open grave there stood men of widely different creeds, united for the moment by the common sorrow and their deep sense of loss. From pulpit and press, from loyal friends and honest opponents, the tribute to the worth of Mr. Maurice was both sincere and generous.&quot;

Frederick Denison Maurice is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 1 April.

Denison Road in Ealing, London is named after him.

===Personal legacy===
Maurice&#x27;s close friends were &quot;deeply impressed with the spirituality of his character&quot;. His wife observed that whenever Maurice was awake in the night, he was &quot;always praying&quot;. Charles Kingsley called him &quot;the most beautiful human soul whom God has ever allowed me to meet with&quot;.

Maurice&#x27;s life comprised &quot;contradictory elements&quot;.
* Maurice was a man &quot;of peace, yet his life was spent in a series of conflicts&quot;.
* He was a man &quot;of deep humility, yet so polemical that he often seemed biased&quot;.
* He was a man &quot;of large charity, yet bitter in his attack upon the religious press of his time&quot;. 
* He was &quot;a loyal churchman who detested the label &quot;Broad&quot; yet poured out criticism upon the leaders of the Church&quot;. 
* He was a man of &quot;a kindly dignity&quot; combined with &quot;a large sense of humour&quot;. 
* He possessed &quot;an intense capacity for visualizing the unseen&quot;.

===Teaching legacy===
As a professor at King&#x27;s College and at Cambridge, Maurice attracted &quot;a band of earnest students&quot; to whom he gave two things. He taught them from the knowledge he had gained by his comprehensive reading. More importantly, Maurice instilled in students &quot;the habit of inquiry and research&quot; and a &quot;desire for knowledge and the process of independent thought&quot;.

===Written legacy===
Maurice&#x27;s written legacy includes &quot;nearly 40 volumes&quot;, and they hold &quot;a permanent place in the history of thought in his time&quot;. His writings are &quot;recognizable as the utterance of a mind profoundly Christian in all its convictions.&quot;

By themselves, two of Maurice&#x27;s books, &quot;The Kingdom of Christ&quot; (1838 and later editions) and &quot;Moral and Metaphysical Philosophy&quot; (2 volumes, 1871–1872), are &quot;remarkable enough to have made their writer famous.&quot; But there are more reasons for Maurice&#x27;s fame. In his &quot;life-work&quot; Maurice was &quot;constantly teaching, writing, guiding, organizing; training up others to do the same kind of work, but giving them something of his spirit, never simply his views&quot;. He drew out &quot;all the best that was in others, never trying to force himself upon them&quot;. With his opponents, Maurice tried to find some &quot;common ground&quot; between them. None who knew him personally &quot;could doubt that he was indeed a man of God&quot;.

In &quot;The Kingdom of Christ&quot; Maurice viewed the true church as a united body that transcended the &quot;diversities and partialities of its individual members, factions, and sects&quot;. The true church had six signs: &quot;baptism, creeds, set forms of worship, the eucharist, an ordained ministry, and the Bible&quot;. Maurice&#x27;s ideas were reflected a half-century later by William Reed Huntington and the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral. The modern ecumenical movement also incorporated Maurice&#x27;s ideas contained in his &quot;The Kingdom of Christ&quot;.

===Decline and revival of interest in legacy===
Interest in the vast legacy of writings bequeathed by Maurice declined even before his death. Hugh Walker, a fellow academic, predicted in 1910 that neither of Maurice&#x27;s major works, his &quot;Theological Essays&quot; (1853) and his &quot;Moral and Metaphysical Philosophy&quot; (1871–1872), will &quot;stand the test of time.&quot; However, &quot;this phase of neglect has passed.&quot;

&quot;Since World War II there has been a revival of interest in Maurice as a theologian.&quot; During this period, twenty-three books about Maurice have been published (some only in part) as can be seen in the References section of this article.

Maurice is honoured with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer on 1 April as &quot;Frederick Denison Maurice, Priest, 1872&quot; and a brief biography is included in the church&#x27;s &quot;Holy Women, Holy Men: Celebrating the Saints&quot;.

Despite Maurice&#x27;s dismissal by King&#x27;s College after the publication of his &quot;Theological Essays&quot;, &quot;a chair at King&#x27;s, the F D Maurice Professorship of Moral and Social Theology, now commemorates his contribution to scholarship at the College.&quot;

King&#x27;s College also established &quot;The FD Maurice Lectures&quot; in 1933 in honour of Maurice. Maurice, who was Professor of English Literature and History (1840–1846) and then Professor of Theology (1846–1853).

==Writings==
Maurice&#x27;s writings result from diligent work on his part. As a rule he &quot;rose early&quot; and did his socializing with friends at breakfast. He dictated his writings until dinner-time. The manuscripts he dictated were &quot;elaborately corrected and rewritten&quot; before publication.

Maurice&#x27;s writings hold &quot;a permanent place in the history of thought in his time.&quot;
Some of the following were &quot;rewritten and in a measure recast, and the date given is not necessarily that of the first appearance.&quot; Most of these writings &quot;were first delivered as sermons or lectures.&quot;
