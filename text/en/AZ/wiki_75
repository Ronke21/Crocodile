<text>The history of the English penny from 1154 to 1485 covers the period of the House of Plantagenet, up to the Battle of Bosworth Field which brought about the beginning of the Tudor period. The Plantagenet era saw an overall rise in quality of the coinage but saw a decline in the number of mints used to produce coins.

The first years of the reign of Henry II saw no change in the production of coins from the reign of Stephen, until the Tealby penny was introduced, minted from 1158 to 1180. These coins&#x27; weight and quality of silver were good, but the overall production was poor; as a result, in 1180 the short-cross penny was introduced.

The coinage during the reigns of Richard I and John remained largely unchanged. In 1247, under Henry III, the long-cross penny replaced the short-cross penny to deter clipping. In 1279 Edward I began a new coinage which was admired and imitated on the continent, and included the introduction of the farthing, halfpenny and groat, as well as making clipping easier to detect. This design remained similar throughout the reigns of Edward II and Edward III, with the addition of the quarter noble, half noble and noble in the latter&#x27;s reign.

During the Wars of the Roses, Henry VI&#x27;s administration kept a sufficient supply of coins in circulation, with many designs and variations of the penny minted. Henry would later be overthrown by Edward IV, who was in turn succeeded by Edward V, with Richard, Duke of Gloucester acting as Lord Protector. Richard became king in 1483 with only a small number of coins minted in his name, and was defeated at the Battle of Bosworth Field by Henry VII in 1485.

== The Plantagenets (1154–1485) ==
===Henry II===

Henry II ascended the throne in 1154 as the first of the Plantagenet dynasty. For the first few years of his reign the coins of Stephen continued to be produced, but in order to restore public confidence in the currency a new standard was introduced: the Tealby penny, so named after a hoard of such coins was found at Tealby, Lincolnshire in 1807. A total of 30 mints were employed in the initial recoinage (the mint at Ipswich was not active during the early stages – but was extremely productive from class B until the end of the series). The mints in operation at the beginning of the recoinage were: Bedford, Bristol, Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Carlisle, Chester, Colchester, Durham, Exeter, Gloucester, Hereford, Ilchester, Launceston, Leicester, Lincoln, London, Newcastle, Northampton, Norwich, Oxford, Pembroke, Salisbury, Shrewsbury, Stafford, Thetford, Wallingford, Wilton, Winchester, and York. However, once the recoinage was completed only 12 mints were allowed to remain active. This marked the beginning of the gradual decline in the number of mints used to strike English coins.

While the Tealby coinage was acceptable in terms of weight and silver quality, the overall quality of production was quite poor. To remedy this, in 1180 a new style of coin, the short-cross penny, was introduced. This style remained largely unchanged until 1247, which gave both the coinage and the state a sense of stability. The practice of placing the moneyer&#x27;s name and mint on the reverse continued, though the reduction in the number of mints enabled better quality control to be applied. The Tealby coins bear the obverse inscriptions – &quot;Henry King of England&quot;, or &quot;King Henry&quot;, while the short-cross pennies are inscribed . Short-cross coins were minted at Carlisle, Exeter, Lincoln, London, Northampton, Norwich, Oxford, Wilton, Winchester, Worcester, and York.

===Richard I and John===

During the reign of King Richard I (1189–1199) the short-cross coinage continued unchanged, even to the extent of still being inscribed . Ricardian coins were minted at Canterbury, Carlisle, Durham, Exeter, Lichfield, Lincoln, London, Northampton, Norwich, Shrewsbury, Winchester, Worcester, and York.

King John&#x27;s coins (1199–1216) continued the short-cross series, still inscribed . John&#x27;s coins were minted at Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Carlisle, Chichester, Durham, Exeter, Ipswich, King&#x27;s Lynn, Lincoln, London, Northampton, Norwich, Oxford, Rhuddlan (although many of the short-cross coins minted there were doubtless imitative issues by Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, prince of Wales, John&#x27;s son-in-law), Rochester, Winchester, and York.

===Henry III===
In King Henry III&#x27;s long reign (1216–1272) the short-cross penny continued in use until 1247. By then, however, through no fault of the moneyers&#x27; there was a problem in that many of the coins in circulation were underweight. This was caused by the illegal practice of clipping silver off the edge of the coin, which was made easier by the cross on the reverse not extending to the rim thus giving people no clear indication of exactly how big the coin was supposed to be. In 1247 therefore, a new long-cross penny replaced the short-cross coin, which made it more obvious when the coin had been clipped. Apart from the change in the size of the cross, the rest of the design did not substantially change, and the long cross made it easy to cut the coin into halves or quarters for change. Because of the introduction of the new coinage, it was necessary to reopen many of the old mints to supply sufficient coins. Short-cross Henry III pennies were minted at Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Durham, London, Winchester and York. Long-cross pennies were produced at Bristol, Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Carlisle, Durham, Exeter, Gloucester, Hereford, Ilchester, Lincoln, London, Newcastle, Northampton, Norwich, Oxford, Shrewsbury, Wallingford, Wilton, Winchester, and York.

The inscription on the short-cross penny was still , while the long-cross pennies were variously inscribed (&quot;King Henry the Third&quot;), while one issue unpopularly omitted the moneyer&#x27;s name, instead having on the obverse and on the reverse, while another issue had on the obverse and continued on the reverse with indicating it was minted in London or Canterbury or Bury St Edmunds.

===Edwardian coins===

Edward I (1272–1307) succeeded his father while on Crusade in the Holy Land. Coin production had to continue while the king made his two-year journey home, so long-cross pennies inscribed continued to be produced at the Bury St Edmunds, Durham, and London mints. As Edward made his way home, he concluded an important wool-trade treaty in the Netherlands, which indicated the importance of foreign trade at that time. He also acknowledged the need to improve the style and fineness of English coins to avoid the poor-quality coins which had sometimes appeared during earlier reigns and shaken public confidence in the currency. There was also a need for larger and smaller denominations since the penny had not changed much in 500 years, so the groat (4d), halfpenny, and farthing were successfully introduced. Finally, there was the problem of clipping, for which the Jews were blamed.

In response to all these pressures, a completely new coinage was struck in 1279 with a different design which made clipping much easier to detect. Millions of coins were struck at London and Canterbury and the public could take their old, underweight short- and long-cross pennies to the mint and exchange them for new coins of the correct weight and fineness. This exchange also served as a form of taxation as moneyers were required to charge a fee for the service. The new coins were much admired in Europe and were extensively copied there, often with poorer fineness silver – but this only made Edward&#x27;s coins even more popular and severely drained the local supply of silver such that the export of English coins was forbidden in 1299. The strong, good-quality coins strengthened the economy and brought prosperity to the country. The 1279 penny was different from earlier issues in many ways. The king&#x27;s bust is more lifelike, facing the front, and the legend on the obverse is longer, usually – &quot;Edward King of England Lord of Ireland&quot;. The reverse had a long cross going to the edge of the coin; the moneyer&#x27;s name is omitted except for one issue, but the name of the mint is usually given in full, e.g., &quot;City of London&quot;, or &quot;Town of Newcastle&quot;. The new coins also contained a privy mark, small differences such as a rose on the king&#x27;s breast, differences in the king&#x27;s hair style, or an alteration in the size of the king&#x27;s eyes, or the style of a letter; these differences were not caused by carelessness but to enable identification of the moneyer who produced the coin, in place of giving the moneyer&#x27;s name.
The crockards, pollards, and rosaries minted in Europe as debased forms of Edward&#x27;s penny were first accepted as the legal equivalents of halfpence and then banned as counterfeit. The treasurer and justiciar of Ireland, Archbishop Stephen de Fulbourn, had permitted the use of similarly debased Dutch shillings as equivalent to pence. These became known as steepings, scaldings, and Bishop&#x27;s money but were also banned, as were leonines, mitres, and eagles named for the images they bore.

Coins of Edward II (1307–1327) were deliberately made very similar to those of his father. Edward I coins were minted at Berwick-upon-Tweed, Bristol, Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Chester, Durham, Exeter, Kingston-upon-Hull, Lincoln, London, Newcastle, Reading, and York. Edward II coins were only minted at Berwick, Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Durham, and London.

Edward III (1327–1377) succeeded his father at the age of 14. His reign was a period of conflict with Scotland and France, which is reflected in his coins. In the first part of Edward&#x27;s reign only a small quantity of pennies was produced, in a similar style to those of his father. New gold coins – the noble, half noble, and the quarter noble – were introduced, followed later by the silver groat or fourpence which became very popular and eventually superseded the penny in importance, together with the half groat which was also popular. Together with the production of half pennies and farthings, England had at last an adequate supply of varying denominations which benefited both internal trade and trade with other countries in Europe where English coins were readily accepted.

Edward III&#x27;s first coinage, between 1327 and 1335, is very similar to the Edward I and II pennies, with the inscription around a front-facing bust of the king; these pennies were minted in London, Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Durham, York, and Berwick upon Tweed. No more pennies were minted until his third, or florin, coinage in 1344–1351 (so-called because the dies were made by two craftsmen from Florence). In this coinage the king&#x27;s hairstyle appears to be much longer and more unkempt. These coins were produced in London, Canterbury, Durham, Reading, and York. During the period of Edward&#x27;s fourth coinage (1351–1377) politics affected the inscription on most coins, but to a lesser extent on the penny than on the larger coins, due to the lack of available space. Edward claimed the throne of France, but the Treaty of Brétigny in 1360 granted him land in France; on some coins, but not the penny, his overlordship of Aquitaine is recognised. After the treaty was repudiated by the French in 1369 the claim to France was reinstated and England and France went to war again, though England lost most of its French possessions except Calais and Bordeaux. Pre-treaty pennies were minted in London, Durham and York, with the obverse legend . During the Treaty period the Durham and York mints continued to mint pennies with that inscription, while ones produced by the London and Calais mints were inscribed . During the post-treaty period the Durham and York mints became &quot;ecclesiastical mints&quot;, under the authority of the local bishop or archbishop, and thus a source of money for the Church. Typical inscriptions of this period are – &quot;Edward King of England and France&quot;.

===Richard II===

Edward III&#x27;s son, the Black Prince, died in 1376, a year before his father, which meant that the next king was Edward&#x27;s eleven-year-old grandson Richard II (1377–1399). England continued to lay claim to France and remained at war until 1396; high taxation to pay for the war caused several peasant uprisings. During this period large quantities of inferior quality European coins circulated alongside the high-quality English coins, producing a real-life example of Gresham&#x27;s law as English coins were smuggled to the continent to be melted down, alloyed with other metals and remanufactured as fake pennies and returned to England. Pennies were produced at London, York and Durham, and inscribed .

===Lancastrians and Yorkists===

In 1399, Henry, Duke of Lancaster – another grandson of Edward III – overthrew his cousin and ruled as Henry IV (1399–1413). This was a turbulent time with wars being fought in both Scotland and Wales, and the coinage problems of the previous reign continued; the price of silver and gold was low in England compared to Europe, and coins were illegally smuggled abroad, causing major problems in England as not only were there insufficient coins in circulation, but the mints could not buy enough bullion to make new coins. Henry IV&#x27;s pennies are divided into &quot;heavy&quot; coinage (prior to 1412), when the weight of the coins had not been adjusted to reflect the continental price of silver, and the &quot;light&quot; coinage of 1412–13 when the silver content was reduced to correspond to the continental price of silver, thus putting an end to the illegal export of English coinage. The heavy coinage was minted at London and York, inscribed – &quot;Henry by the Grace of God King of England&quot;, while the light coinage was minted at London, York, and Durham, inscribed .
Henry V (1413–1422) continued his father&#x27;s light coinage, with similar inscriptions on the coins produced at London, Durham, and York.
Henry VI (1422–1461, 1470–1471) came to the throne as an infant. He favoured making peace with France, but his heir, Richard, Duke of York, a descendant of the second son of Edward III, favoured war; this disagreement precipitated the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses between his supporters, the Lancastrians (red rose), and those of the Yorkists (white rose). The nobility attached itself to one side or the other (and often changed sides), but eventually in 1461 Henry was defeated by Richard&#x27;s son, who became King Edward IV; Henry was incarcerated in the Tower of London for nine years, but the wars continued and in October 1470 Edward was forced to flee to the continent and Henry was restored to the throne. This restoration was only brief, however, as Edward mustered more support and after two battles at Barnet and Tewkesbury Edward was back on the throne in April 1471 where he stayed until his death in 1483. Henry was returned to the Tower, where he was murdered the same night.

Despite the upheavals of the time, Henry VI&#x27;s administration maintained an adequate supply of coinage throughout the first reign. There were several different issues of pennies distinguished by different features such as rosettes or pinecones appearing in the legend, or a leaf appearing on the king&#x27;s breast, etc. The normal inscription was . Pennies were minted at London, Calais, York, and Durham.

During Edward IV&#x27;s first reign the problem of English coins&#x27; face value being worth less than their metal value in Europe recurred. In 1464 Edward acted to solve the problem by reducing the weight of all silver coins by about 20%: the &quot;heavy&quot; penny issued between 1461 and 1464 weighed 15 grains (1.0 gram) and was minted at London, York, and Durham; the &quot;light&quot; penny weighed 12 grains (0.8 gram) and was minted in London, Bristol, Canterbury, Durham, and York. They were all inscribed .

Despite the short duration of Henry VI&#x27;s second reign, pennies were produced in similar style to the first reign at London, Bristol, and York. Edward IV&#x27;s second reign pennies are basically continuations of his first reign, produced at the same mints. By this time all reigns used mintmarks on their coins to identify the moneyers.

Edward IV died suddenly in 1483 and was succeeded by his twelve-year-old son Edward V. In the turbulent times it became known that there was some problem with the legality of Edward IV&#x27;s marriage, and rather than let Edward be king with a regency, Parliament deposed him and appointed Edward IV&#x27;s brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester as King Richard III. Edward and his younger brother Richard, Duke of York, were taken to the Tower of London, and the Princes in the Tower were never seen again. Who was responsible for their ultimate fate remains a topic of heated discussion to this day. There is evidence that some coins were struck for King Edward V, but it is uncertain that any have survived.

Richard III (1483–1485) was the last of the Plantagenet kings. Before his demise at the Battle of Bosworth Field, pennies were produced for him, inscribed , at London, York and Durham, but they are &quot;very&quot; rare – only one penny is known which was produced in the London mint.

<text>The history of the English penny from 1485 to 1603 covers the period of the House of Tudor up to the death of Elizabeth I without an heir. The Tudor era saw the debasement of the penny under Henry VIII and Edward VI, with Elizabeth I&#x27;s reign overseeing the recovery of the silver quality. Under the Tudors, the penny decreased in size.

== The Tudors (1485–1603) ==

===Henry VII===

Henry Tudor, who reigned as King Henry VI between 1485 and 1509, had a tenuous claim on the throne, being the Lancastrian claimant via an illegitimate descendant of Edward III when all the senior candidates had been killed off in the Wars of the Roses. He concluded the wars with his victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Subsequently, He consolidated his power through various means, including his marriage to Elizabeth of York, which united the two warring dynasties. Henry VII&#x27;s reign was marked by pretenders&#x27; claims to the throne, whose existence resulted from the king&#x27;s initially insecure grasp of power; Henry could subdue each of the attempted usurpers without particular difficulty. The whole style of Henry&#x27;s coinage marked a break with what had gone before — the king&#x27;s bust became more lifelike, and the shields on the reverse became much more detailed. Henry&#x27;s first coinage is very like that of Henry V and Henry VI, minted at London, Canterbury, Durham, and York. The inscription was one of a variety of — &quot;Henry by the grace of God King of England&quot;. Henry introduced what is known as the &quot;Sovereign coinage&quot;, so called because the king is depicted seated on a throne, while the reverse shows the royal shield over a cross. The issue is regarded as marking the division between the coins of the Middle Ages and of the Renaissance in England. The Sovereign coinage was minted at London, Durham, and York, and inscribed with one of a variety of .

===Henry VIII===

Henry&#x27;s first coinage, to 1526, resembled that of his father and still used his father&#x27;s portrait. With higher bullion prices on Europe, the weight of the silver coins was reduced again. Pennies were minted at the London, Canterbury, and Durham mints. With the reformation starting in the 1530s, the principal effect as far as the coinage; the closure of the ecclesiastical mints of Canterbury, Durham and York — in future all mints would be Royal mints, under the control of the crown who would consequently get all the revenue. The second coinage, from 1526 to 1544 had a completely different inscription, — &quot;Henry by the grace of God a rose without a thorn&quot;. At this time the pound standard for mintage was changed from the local Tower pound to the internationally known troy pound. The value of a pennyweight increased from 1.46 grams to 1.56 grams. The coins were minted at London, Canterbury, Durham, and York ecclesiastical mints.

The Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1530s and the ratification of the First Act of Supremacy in 1534 resulted in a financial bonus for the king. By 1544, Henry was running short of money, partially to his extravagant lifestyle and expenditure. Henry&#x27;s solution was to drastically lower the fineness of the third coinage (1544 to 1547) to only one-third silver and two-thirds copper. This was understandably unpopular with the people, resulting in Henry acquiring the nickname &quot;Old Coppernose&quot; as the silver rubbed off the high-relief part of the coin design. By this time, there were two mints in London, at the Tower and in Southwark, and both of them, together with mints in Bristol, Canterbury, and York produced the debased coinage which bore the inscription .

===Edward VI===

The debased coinage caused rampant inflation when Henry VIII died in 1547. He left behind the Country with Edward VI that contained religious turmoil and economic unrest. The influx of silver and gold from Central and South America into Spain and to the rest of Europe was destabilising the price of bullion and worsening the situation.

Until 1551, what is known as the posthumous coinage was produced — the coins were exactly the same as Henry&#x27;s last issue, but with a different portrait of him. Inflation over the last thirty years had made the penny much less important for the next few reigns. The reign of Edward VI (1547 to 1553) was numismatically important for seeing the introduction of new denominations — the silver crown, half crown, shilling, Sixpence, and Threepence — which were to survive until 1971, and were a reflection of the increasing wealth of the country. The new coins were struck in silver, with the aim of revitalising the economy. Edward VI&#x27;s pennies, were made using debased metal at the Tower, Southwark, Bristol and York, with the inscription — &quot;Edward by the grace of God a rose without a thorn&quot;.

===Mary I===

In 1553, Edward VI died and was succeeded — after the nine-day rule of Lady Jane Grey — by his older sister, the strongly Catholic Queen Mary I. Pennies of Her first year, bearing her head alone with the inscription — &quot;Mary by the grace of God a rose without a thorn&quot; — are rare. In 1554, she married Philip, the Prince of Spain, and put his portrait on the coinage and her own. Both silver and base metal pennies of Mary I&#x27;s reign were issued from the Tower mint, with the legend — &quot;Philip and Mary by the grace of God a rose without a thorn&quot;.

===Elizabeth I===
When Elizabeth I ascended the throne in 1558, England was an impoverished country, in religious turmoil, and with a coinage that was in a poor state after Henry VIII&#x27;s debasement, since when little had been done to improve the quantity or quality of the coins in circulation. The coinage system as whole, needed a reform, and Elizabeth set about doing this. Throughout her reign, large quantities of gold and silver coins of many denominations were produced (the gold and silver often being obtained by raiding Spanish shipping); of the silver denominations produced the shilling and sixpence were most important, but small denomination coins — groats, threepences, half-groats, three-halfpence, pennies, three-farthings, and halfpennies — were also struck and were very popular with merchants and small traders.

For the first time in England &quot;milled&quot;, or machine-produced, coins were produced by Eloye Mestrelle, an ex-employee of the Paris mint, between 1560 and 1572. Still, while the milled issue was fairly successful, there was controversy towards Mestrelle by other employees of the Tower mint who feared for their jobs, leading to his dismissal. No milled pennies were produced, as they would probably have been too small to be mechanically produced by the equipment of the time. Some of Elizabeth&#x27;s coins were dated for the first time.

Elizabethan pennies are very small, and are often found creased or bent. The obverse bears the legend — &quot;Elizabeth by the grace of God a rose without a thorn&quot; — around a left-facing bust of the queen, while the reverse bears the legend — &quot;City of London&quot;. All pennies were minted at the Tower mint in London.

<text>The history of the [[Penny (English coin)|English penny]] from 1603 to 1707 covers the period of the House of Stuart, up to the Acts of Union of 1707 which brought about the Union of the Kingdom of England with the Kingdom of Scotland.

== The Stuarts and the Commonwealth (1603–1714) ==

=== The Early Stuarts ===
When Elizabeth died unmarried and childless in 1603, the throne passed to James VI of Scotland, a great-grandson of Henry VII, who ruled in England as James I. James&#x27;s silver coinage changed little from that of Elizabeth in production and style. The most notable feature was the introduction of a copper farthing to help with the problem of small change. With inflation, the penny continued to become a less important denomination.

The first coinage, of 1603–4, shows a bust of the king facing right with the inscription on the obverse, and a shield including the Scottish coat of arms on the reverse. The second (1604–1619) and third coinages show a rose instead of the king&#x27;s bust on the obverse, with the inscription, while the reverse contains a thistle surrounded by the inscription – &quot;May God guard these united (kingdoms)&quot;. All the coins were minted at the Tower of London.

In 1625 the 25-year-old second son of James I, Charles I, inherited the throne (his older brother Henry having died before his father). Unfortunately Charles&#x27;s political judgment was appalling – he reigned for eleven years without convening the Parliament of England, as he was not disposed to accept direction from it when it was sitting, and the ensuing Civil War eventually cost Charles both his crown and his head.

Numismatically, Charles I&#x27;s reign is without doubt the most interesting and complicated of any English monarch. Many varieties were produced at the Tower mint, and a number of provincial mints were opened during the Civil War, though as these were mainly opened to produce coins to pay the troops, the number of pennies produced there was quite low, as larger denominations were preferred. Between 1630 and 1639 the Frenchman, Nicholas Briot produced a milled coinage which for the first time included pennies. The quality of Briot&#x27;s coins is superb, and one can only conclude that the only reason the Tower mint was not turned over completely to machine production was professional jealousy from the other workers.

Charles&#x27;s hammered pennies produced at the Tower originally had a design of a rose on both sides, with the inscription on the obverse and – &quot;Justice strengthens the throne&quot; – on the reverse. Later pennies bore a bust of the king facing left with a behind the head to denote the denomination of one penny, with the inscription – &quot;Charles by the grace of God King of Great Britain France and Ireland&quot;, while the reverse shows an oval shield and the inscription. Following the takeover of the Tower mint by the English Parliament in 1642, the same coin designs were produced until 1648 though with an older-looking bust of the king; this was to emphasise the fact that Parliaments&#x27; argument was not with the king but with his &quot;evil advisors&quot;.

In 1638 a new mint was opened at Aberystwyth castle, Wales, to produce smaller coins (penny to half-crown) from locally produced silver. These are identifiable by having plumes (like the Prince of Wales&#x27;s feathers on the 1967–2007 era decimal Two decimal pence coin) on the reverse. Following damage to the castle mint in 1648 there was a short-lived mint located at the actual silver mine in Aberystwyth in 1648/9, but no records have survived of what coins were produced there.

With the take-over by the English Parliament of the Tower mint in 1642, the king set up his permanent headquarters at Oxford and established his main mint there. Most pennies produced there were made from dies from the Aberystwyth mint, so they look very similar to Aberystwyth coins. There is a very rare &quot;Declaration penny&quot; produced in 1644 where the reverse contains the declaration – &quot;The religion of the Protestants the laws of England the liberty of Parliament&quot;. The Oxford mint closed in 1646.

Bristol was captured by the Royalists in July 1643 and a mint was established there, producing pennies with the plume reverse, but it was closed when the English Parliament recaptured the city in 1645. The Exeter mint which operated between 1643 and April 1646 mainly produced crowns and half-crowns, but also made some pennies.

=== The Commonwealth ===

The Commonwealth of England (1649–60) is well known for having produced the only English coins which did not contain any Latin inscription at all. This was due to an association of Latin with Catholicism. As far as the Commonwealth penny is concerned, the inscriptions are totally absent. The reverse shows St George&#x27;s shield within a wreath, while the obverse shows St George&#x27;s shield and an Irish shield, with the denomination above them.

=== The Restored Stuarts ===

Following the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 in the form of Charles II, both hammered and milled coinage was produced until 1662. The penny was a fairly common denomination and was produced by both methods from dies produced by Thomas Simon. The obverse showed a left-facing bust of the new king with no value indication behind his head, and the inscription – &quot;Charles II by the grace of God King of Great Britain France and Ireland&quot;. The reverse shows the king&#x27;s shield over a cross, with the legend – &quot;I reign under the auspices of Christ&quot;. This issue marks the end of the English hammered coinage – all subsequent English and British coins have been milled.

The first regular milled silver pennies appeared around 1664 or 1665 and are undated, weighing 0.5 grams and being 12 mm in diameter. They show the king facing left, with behind the head, inscribed , and the reverse shows a shield enclosing the Arms of England, Scotland, Ireland and France, inscribed . From 1670 to 1684 dated pennies were produced each year, showing the king facing right with the inscription , while the reverse shows a crowned &quot;C&quot; with the inscription .

The same basic design continued in the short reign of James II (1685–1688) with the crowned &quot;C&quot; on the reverse replaced by a crowned &quot;I&quot; which acted not only as the king&#x27;s initial &quot;Iacobus&quot; but as the indication of the denomination, 1 penny.

Following the birth of the Catholic James II&#x27;s only son James Francis Edward Stuart (&quot;The Old Pretender&quot;), the English establishment determined to avoid the possibility of a Catholic dynasty on the English throne by engineering the Glorious Revolution, when the throne was offered to the older of James&#x27;s two Protestant daughters from his first marriage and her husband, the &quot;Stadhouder&quot; of the Dutch Republic, who reigned as co-monarchs, William III (1689–1702) and Mary II (1689–1694). The silver pennies of this reign bear the combined heads of the two monarchs facing right on the obverse with the inscription – &quot;William and Mary by the grace of God&quot;, while the reverse still contains the crowned &quot;I&quot; which now represented only the denomination, with the inscription – &quot;King and Queen of Great Britain France and Ireland&quot;.

Following the death of Queen Mary from smallpox in 1694 the coins continued with King William&#x27;s head facing right and the inscription – &quot;William III by the grace of God&quot;, on the reverse, and the crowned &quot;I&quot; and – &quot;King of Great Britain France and Ireland&quot;. Pennies were produced in 1698–1701.

==Anglo-Scottish Union==

William III was succeeded in 1702 by Mary&#x27;s younger sister, Anne. During Anne&#x27;s reign the kingdoms of England and Scotland were united in 1707 (see Acts of Union 1707), to form what is usually referred to as the Kingdom of Great Britain. Twelve Pounds Scots were exchanged for 1 pound sterling so a shilling Scots corresponded to an English penny.

Despite having had ten pregnancies, none of Anne&#x27;s children survived, and the Stuart dynasty died with her in 1714. In accordance with the Act of Settlement 1701 the crown passed to the Protestant descendants of Sophia, Electress of Hanover, in the form of king George I.

Anne&#x27;s reign produced silver pennies in 1703, 1705, 1706, 1708, 1709, 1710, and 1713. The obverse of the coins show her left-facing bust with the inscription , while the reverse shows the crowned &quot;I&quot; and (1703) , (1705,6) , or (1708–13) .

<doc id="208533" wikidata="Q5869168" url="?curid=208533" title="History of the British penny (1714–1901)">
<text>The penny of Great Britain and the United Kingdom from 1714 to 1901, the period in which the House of Hanover reigned, saw the transformation of the penny from a little-used small silver coin to the bronze piece recognisable to modern-day Britons. All bear the portrait of the monarch on the obverse; copper and bronze pennies have a depiction of Britannia, the female personification of Britain, on the reverse.

During most of the 18th century, the penny was a small silver coin rarely seen in circulation, and that was principally struck to be used for Maundy money or other royal charity. Beginning in 1787, the chronic shortage of good money resulted in the wide circulation of private tokens, including large coppers valued at one penny. In 1797 industrialist Matthew Boulton gained a contract to produce official pennies at his Soho Mint in Birmingham; he struck millions of pennies over the next decade. After that, it was not until 1825 that pennies were struck again for circulation, and the copper penny continued to be issued until 1860.

By the late 1850s, the state of the copper coinage was deemed unsatisfactory, with quantities of worn oversized pieces, some dating from Boulton&#x27;s day, still circulating. They were replaced by lighter bronze coins beginning in 1860; the &quot;Bun penny&quot;, named for the hairstyle of Queen Victoria on it, was issued from then until 1894. The final years of Victoria&#x27;s reign saw the &quot;Veiled head&quot; or &quot;Old head&quot; pennies, which were coined from 1895 until her death in 1901.

== Silver penny (18th century) ==
At the start of the reign of George I, in 1714, the English penny had been struck from silver for about a thousand years. The Hanoverian dynasty in Britain began during the time that Sir Isaac Newton was Master of the Mint. Newton had in 1702 considered the issuance of a copper penny, but no action was taken. Silver at this time came to the Royal Mint only as the by-product of mining for other substances, and from chance deposits and windfalls—the scandal-plagued South Sea Company in 1723 was obliged to send a large quantity of silver bullion to the Mint&#x27;s premises in the Tower of London. Nevertheless, so little was sent overall that MP John Conduitt, Newton&#x27;s successor as Master, wrote in 1730 that since December 1701, &quot;no silver has been imported to the Mint but what was forced thither&quot;. Only small quantities of silver pennies were struck in the early years of George&#x27;s reign; it and the silver twopence were unpopular in any case because of their small size.

The change in dynasty did not affect the form of the silver penny—a 12 mm diameter coin weighing 0.5 gram. George&#x27;s pennies had the inscription continuing onto the other side with and the date, around the crowned &quot;I&quot;. The representation of George was by John Croker or his assistant Samuel Bull; they had designed the busts of William III and of Queen Anne that had appeared on earlier pennies. The Roman numeral I on the coins dated from the reign of James II, and was at first intended to denote the King&#x27;s initial in Latin (IACOBUS) but was kept a Roman numeral when the twopence, threepence, and fourpence were given Arabic numerals under William III and Mary. Pennies were minted in 1716, 1718, 1720, 1723, 1725, 1726 and 1727, the last of these the date of George&#x27;s death and of the accession of his son, George II.

The major purpose for the silver penny in the 18th century was as Maundy money. Most silver pennies after 1727 were likely used for that purpose; the mintages were enough to provide for this, but not enough for general circulation. In some years, the Maundy money may have been composed entirely of pennies, though there are accounts of the twopence, threepence, and groat being used as well. At times, there were gaps in the dating as enough for several years was struck at once, to be held against need. There were enough silver pennies in circulation that Maundy recipients could spend their gifts. By 1727, the price of silver guaranteed that pennies were struck at a loss. When other regal coins began use of a bust showing George II as an older man in 1740–1743, the penny remained unaltered. Brian Robinson, in his book on the Royal Maundy, suggested that a new bust for a coin issued only in small quantities would not have been worth the 12 weeks&#x27; work it would have taken a Mint engraver to create new dies. In any event, between 1727 and 1816, silver cost too much for there to be much coinage of it. George II&#x27;s pennies had a left-facing bust of him and the inscription continuing onto the other side with and the date around the crowned &quot;I&quot;. Pennies were minted in 1729, 1731, 1732, 1735, 1737, 1739, 1740, 1743, 1746 and 1750, and between 1752 and 1760. No pennies were issued dated 1733 or 1744, likely because the year in Britain still began on 25 March, and Maundy Thursday did not occur during those twelve-month periods.
Into the reign of King George III (1760–1820), the silver penny continued to be used mostly as a Maundy piece. Pennies similar to those of previous reigns, but bearing George III&#x27;s head and the inscription , were struck in 1763, 1766, 1770, 1772, 1776, 1779, 1780, 1781, 1784 and 1786. A new bust of the King was introduced to the penny in 1792, and was struck dated that year, 1795, and 1800. The third, laureated bust of the king with an unchanged obverse inscription was on the silver penny in 1817, 1818 and 1820. George III&#x27;s first reverse, used until 1780, showed the crowned &quot;I&quot; in high relief, with the inscription . A modification was made in 1781, with the relief of the central &quot;I&quot; on the reverse lowered, likely because part of the outline of the I had been visible on the King&#x27;s head on the other side of the coin. This second reverse, used until 1786, was similar but in lower relief, the &quot;I&quot; being much flatter; the third reverse, used in 1792 only, was completely redesigned with a much smaller &quot;I&quot; under a smaller crown with the inscription running around the crown, with the same legend as before. The fourth reverse, used in 1795 and 1800 was similar to the first but with a redesigned crown. The fifth reverse, used from 1817, showed the crowned &quot;I&quot; with the inscription and the date. From 1817, the diameter of the coin was reduced from 12 to 11 millimetres, although the weight remained the same at .5 grams.

== Copper penny (1797–1860) ==
=== Soho issues (1797–1807) ===
With little silver coined in the second half of the 18th century, the burden of small change fell on the copper coinage, of which the highest denomination before 1797 was the halfpenny. Many official halfpennies were melted down clandestinely and lightweight counterfeits were made with the copper. In 1787, the Mint found that at most eight percent of &quot;halfpennies&quot; in circulation were genuine. A withdrawal of the existing copper coinage was deemed impractical due to transport difficulties. The Government would not accept copper coinage for taxes, and the small merchants who accumulated large stocks of real and dubious copper coin sought relief. Areas of the country not near the capital were sometimes short of coppers, since new issues could only be purchased at the Mint&#x27;s office at the Tower of London, in packets of 5 or 10 shillings. The small change shortage made it difficult, by the late 1780s, for employers to pay workers.
The gap was filled, beginning in 1787, by private minters and companies, who issued copper halfpenny and penny tokens. Although not money in a legal sense, they served that purpose, and rapidly spread across the country. Many of the manufacturers of these tokens were found in Birmingham, where industrialist Matthew Boulton struck large numbers of tokens and also constructed the Soho Mint, the first to be powered by steam. He aggressively lobbied for a contract to strike official copper coins. In 1797, the government gave Boulton a contract to strike 480 tonnes of copper pennies and 20 tonnes of copper twopences. The first official British coins of those denominations to be made of copper, they were also the first official British coins to be struck by steam rather than by muscle power.
The large size of the coins, combined with the thick rim where the inscription was incuse (i.e. punched into the metal rather than raised from it), led to the coins being nicknamed &quot;cartwheels&quot;. The design was by Boulton&#x27;s employee Conrad Küchler. The obverse of the cartwheel coinage is a laureated right-facing bust of George III, with the inscription , while the reverse showed Britannia seated on a rock, facing left, holding an olive branch and trident with the inscription . Although Britannia had long appeared on the halfpenny and farthing, the 1797 coinage was the first time she was depicted ruling the waves, an allegory for Britain&#x27;s status as a maritime power. The word may be seen in fine print on the face of the rock just below the shield. Boulton&#x27;s pennies and twopences were meant to contain their face value in copper, i.e. they weighed one and two ounces each (penny28.3 grams, diameter 36 millimetres). In English measure, the penny was just over 1.4 inches in diameter, so that 17 pennies side by side would measure two feet. Boulton obtained a copy of the Royal Society&#x27;s standard foot to get the measurement right. Even though pennies were struck first, reserving the twopences for later, the existing Soho Mint had trouble stamping such large pieces of copper, and Boulton built a new mint at Soho, where by 1799, each press was striking 60 pennies a minute. The 1,250 tonnes of &quot;cartwheels&quot; struck at Soho between 1797 and 1799 (all pieces were dated 1797) exceeded the total copper coinage by the Royal Mint in the 18th century.

Boulton was given a further contract in 1799, but only halfpennies and farthings were struck then. In 1805, Boulton gained another contract. By then, the price of copper had risen; in 1797, a pound of copper had coined 16 pence of coins, and in 1799 that amount of metal had made 18 pence-worth, but it took 24 of the 1806 pennies to weigh a pound. The pennies were issued dated 1806 or 1807; they weigh 18.9 grams ( ounces) and measure 34 millimetres (one-and-a-third inches) in diameter. These were more conventionally designed, also by Küchler, with a right-facing bust of the King and the same inscription as on the obverse of 1797 pennies. The reverse shows the seated Britannia facing left, with olive branch and trident and the inscription . There is one unique penny coin known which is dated 1808, but this is thought to have been a proof. A total of 150 tonnes of copper were used to make the 1806 and 1807 pennies.

=== Regal issues (1825–1860) ===
Finding its premises at the Tower of London too cramped and unsuited to the new technology, the Mint moved to a new building on Tower Hill, and first struck coins there (for the East India Company) in 1811. The coinage was made by steam power, with equipment supplied by Boulton&#x27;s firm. At the beginning of the Great Recoinage of 1816, only gold and silver coins were produced; the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nicholas Vansittart, deemed there to be enough official coppers in commerce to serve. Thus, it was not until after the death of George III in 1820 and the accession of his son George IV that the copper coinage was recommenced. Coinage of pennies and halfpennies resumed in 1825 after the first farthings of the new reign were minted in 1821. The new pennies were authorised by an Order in Council of 14 November 1825, and were made current by a proclamation of 30 January 1826. George IV&#x27;s pennies were struck in only three years (1825, 1826, 1827) and most of the final year&#x27;s mintage is believed to have been sent to Tasmania.
The obverse of George IV&#x27;s pennies shows a left-facing laureated head engraved by William Wyon. This was the second portrait of George IV, and was adopted after the King expressed a dislike for the one engraved by Benedetto Pistrucci, which was never used on the penny. The penny is inscribed and the date, while the reverse shows a right-facing seated Britannia with a shield and trident, inscribed . The penny at this time weighed 18.8 grams and had a diameter of 34 millimetres, the same as Boulton&#x27;s 1806–1807 pennies.

The pennies of King William IV (1830–1837) are similar to those of his predecessor, also being engraved by William Wyon, based on a model by Sir Francis Chantrey. King William&#x27;s head faces right, with the obverse inscribed , while the reverse is identical to the George IV penny. Pennies were minted in 1831, 1834 and 1837. An 1836 penny has been reported but not confirmed.
The pennies of Queen Victoria (1837–1901) form one of the most intricate denominations of British coinage, both before and after the transition from copper to bronze pennies in 1860. A number of specialist books have been published on the many varieties of Victorian pennies. The final years of the copper penny, from 1839 to 1860, saw a portrait of the Queen by William Wyon, usually dubbed the &quot;Young Head&quot;. It had a reverse largely unchanged from King William&#x27;s but for changing an X to a G, thus became , short for Regina (queen), denoting the fact that the monarch was now a woman. Thus, the legend on Victorian copper pennies was . Copper pennies were issued for all years between 1839 and 1860 except 1840, 1842, 1850, and 1852. The Heaton Mint, of Birmingham, had been founded with equipment from the wound-up Soho Mint. Beginning in the early 1850s, it supplied large quantities of blanks for pennies to the Royal Mint, and at times was called upon to strike pennies, though its mint mark H would not appear on pennies until 1874. These contracts were because of the needs of Ireland (where counterfeits and tokens were common) and the colonies; the large quantities struck between 1797 and 1807 by Boulton ensured there were no shortages in England, Scotland and Wales.

== Bronze penny (from 1860) ==

By 1857, both the Royal Mint and the public were dissatisfied by the state of the copper coinage. Much of it was worn or defaced by advertisements, and 14 percent of the pennies in commerce were Boulton&#x27;s 1797 cartwheels. The fact that pennies of different specifications circulated side by side precluded the weighing of quantities of copper coin to ascertain the value. In addition to the pennies struck since 1806, there were Boulton&#x27;s 1797 coppers and also, to a different standard, coppers struck for Ireland, which had been legal tender since 1826. Each sort of penny was deemed too heavy for daily use. The copper coins were so heavy that Charles Dickens in &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; had Mr Mantalini contemplate suicide by drowning himself in the Thames, his pockets filled with halfpennies.

Thomas Graham, the Master of the Mint, in 1859 persuaded William Gladstone, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that the state of the copper currency demanded a lighter, more durable replacement. Bronze was selected as harder and less subject to oxidation. It was a material with which the Mint had experience, having recently struck bronze coins for the Canadian colonies, and it had been used in France since 1852. Gladstone told the House of Commons that were an old and a new penny placed side by side, no one unacquainted with them would dream they represented the same value. Parliament passed legislation in 1860 that allowed the penny to be struck from an alloy of metals. The act required that Britannia appear on the coin, as the design was felt to symbolise Britain as ruler of the waves, and to omit her would be seen as abandoning that role. The Mint in 1860 awarded a contract for 1,720 tonnes of bronze pennies, halfpennies and farthings to James Watt &amp; Co of Birmingham, a contract that would not be completed until 1863. Heaton&#x27;s was also called upon to supply dies and coins, especially as Watt&#x27;s prepared to execute its huge contract.
Although there were calls for a public competition, William Wyon&#x27;s son, Leonard Charles Wyon was chosen to execute the new design. Both the Queen and Prince Albert took a keen interest in the work, and repeated visits by Wyon to Buckingham Palace and Osborne House were necessary before Victoria gave her approval. There is a tale that the Queen returned the penny sent her for final approval by post, but a postman opened the parcel, throwing away the coin in disgust when he realised all that was inside was a penny. The new bronze pieces were made current by a proclamation dated 17 December 1860, and public reaction was positive, both for Wyon&#x27;s designs and for the weight, which had been halved. The new coins were widely distributed through post offices, and in 1861, the Mint began the recall of the old copper pieces, paying a small premium and for the transport. The old copper coins soon vanished from towns; progress in rural areas was more gradual. The pre-1860 copper penny was demonetised after 1869 in Britain (though accepted at full face value by the Mint until 1873) and in 1877 for the colonies—roughly a quarter of the copper coinage struck by the Royal Mint between 1821 and 1856 had been sent overseas, with Ceylon the leading recipient.

The obverse of the new penny read . The Mint had intended to render it with the abbreviation , and some after the coins&#x27; release argued it should have done, but Gladstone had intervened to invoke the rule that the last consonant of a Latin abbreviation should be doubled to indicate the plural. The coin is dubbed the &quot;Bun Head penny&quot; or &quot;Bun penny&quot; for the Queen&#x27;s hairstyle. The reverse depicts Britannia, wearing flowing robes, a breastplate and helmet, and grasping a trident. Her right hand grips a shield, on which is seen the combined crosses of the Union Jack. A ship sails out to sea on her right, and a lighthouse, supposedly the old Eddystone Lighthouse, is seen behind her on her left. The denomination, , appears for the first time on the base-metal piece.

There are many varieties of the Bun penny, as several non-identical dies were prepared (especially in 1860) the design was tweaked a number of times over its 35 years, and the dies were sometimes used in different combinations. The 2017 edition of Spink &amp; Son&#x27;s &quot;Coins of England &amp; the United Kingdom&quot; chronicles 13 obverses, 14 reverses and a large number of die combinations. Differences include the number of leaves on Victoria&#x27;s wreath and whether the border is beaded or toothed. An &quot;H&quot; below the date on 1874, 1875, 1876, 1881 and 1882 pennies indicates that the coin was produced at Heaton&#x27;s in Birmingham. When production at the Royal Mint was stopped for a complete reconstruction in 1882, Heaton&#x27;s, pursuant to contract, produced 50 tonnes of pennies, halfpennies and farthings. Pennies of the Bun type were issued in all years between 1860 and 1894.
Joseph Edgar Boehm&#x27;s &quot;Jubilee head&quot; of the Queen was placed on the gold and silver coinage in 1887 but was not adopted for the bronze, with the Bun head continuing. Boehm&#x27;s rendering proved unpopular, and in 1893 was replaced with the &quot;Veiled head&quot; or &quot;Old head&quot;, by Thomas Brock, and engraved by Chief Engraver of the Royal Mint George William de Saulles. The new penny design was introduced in 1895, the new version being authorised by a proclamation dated 11 May of that year. Victoria is seen as an elderly woman, wearing a diadem partially eclipsed by a veil. She wears a necklace with a pendant, an earring, and the Garter Riband with Star. The inscription became , as the title of Empress of India had been added to the Queen&#x27;s titles in 1876. The reverse was modified by de Saulles, with the most significant change the deletion of the ship and lighthouse. The new design was struck each year from 1895 to 1901, the year in which Victoria died. Coins depicting her and dated 1901 continued to be struck until King Edward VII&#x27;s coinage was ready in May 1902.

<doc id="208535" wikidata="Q2468580" url="?curid=208535" title="USS Bennington (PG-4)">
<text>USS &quot;Bennington&quot; (Gunboat No. 4/PG-43) was a member of the of steel-hulled, twin-screw gunboats in the United States Navy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. She was the first U.S. Navy ship named in honor of the town of Bennington, Vermont, site of the Battle of Bennington in the American Revolutionary War.

The contract to build &quot;Bennington&quot; was awarded to N. F. Palmer &amp; Co. of Philadelphia in November 1887. Her hull was subcontracted to the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding &amp; Engine Works which laid down &quot;Bennington&quot;″s keel in June 1888. &quot;Bennington&quot; was launched in June 1890. She was just over long and abeam and displaced . She was equipped with two steam engines which were supplemented with three schooner-rigged masts. The ship&#x27;s main battery consisted of six guns and was augmented by an assortment of smaller caliber guns.

After her June 1891 commissioning, &quot;Bennington&quot; was attached to the Squadron of Evolution and for its cruise to South America. The gunboat made two Mediterranean tours between 1892 and 1894, after which she was assigned to the duties in the Pacific. She sailed the Pacific coasts of North and Central America and spent time in the Hawaiian Islands to protect American interests there. On her way to support United States Army operations of the Philippine–American War, &quot;Bennington&quot; claimed Wake Island for the United States. After two years in the Philippines, she returned to the United States and was decommissioned for 18 months of repairs and refitting. After her March 1903 recommissioning, most of the next two years were spent patrolling the Pacific coasts of North and South America.

On 21 July 1905 at San Diego, California, &quot;Bennington&quot; suffered a boiler explosion, that killed 66 men and injured nearly everyone else on board. Shortly after the explosion, a tug beached the ship to prevent her from sinking. Eleven men were awarded the Medal of Honor for &quot;extraordinary heroism&quot; in the aftermath of the explosion. After &quot;Bennington&quot; was refloated, the damage was deemed too extensive to repair and the ship was decommissioned in September. The ship was sold for scrap in 1910, but instead served as a water barge for the Matson Line at Honolulu from 1912. In 1924, the former &quot;Bennington&quot; was scuttled off the coast of Oahu.

== Design and construction ==
The &quot;Yorktown&quot; class gunboats – unofficially considered third-class cruisers – were the product of a United States Navy design attempt to produce compact ships with good seakeeping abilities and, yet, able to carry a heavy battery. &quot;Bennington&quot; was authorized in the 1888 fiscal year, and the contract for her construction was awarded to N. F. Palmer &amp; Co. of Chester, Pennsylvania. The hull for &quot;Bennington&quot; was subcontracted to the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding &amp; Engine Works and built to the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Construction and Repair design. The mechanical design was patterned after the layout for her older sister ship developed by William Cramp &amp; Sons.

&quot;Bennington&quot;″s keel was laid down in June 1888, and the ship was launched on 3 June 1890, sponsored by Anne Aston, the daughter of Rear Admiral Ralph Aston, Chief Engineer of the U.S. Navy.

=== Layout ===
As built, &quot;Bennington&quot; was in length and abeam. Her steel hull had an average draft of , which was expected to give her the ability to escape from larger ships into shallow water. At the waterline was a turtleback deck of steel that formed a watertight seal over the lower spaces. The deck had a crown at the level of the waterline and curved downwards to below the waterline at the sides of the ship. Below this armored deck were twelve compartments separated by watertight bulkheads; the spaces above were equipped with watertight doors intended to be closed during battle.

Above the armored deck, &quot;Bennington&quot; had forecastle and poop decks with an open gun deck that spanned the length of the ship between them. The conning tower was located forward on the forecastle deck and was oval-shaped to deflect shot. It was outfitted with a steam-powered Ship&#x27;s wheel, an engine order telegraph, and speaking tubes; it was protected by of steel armor plate.

=== Propulsion ===
&quot;Bennington&quot; was powered by two triple-expansion steam engines which each drove one of the pair of , three-bladed screw propellers. The cylinders of each engine were 22, 31, and 51 inches (56, 79, and 130 cm) in diameter and had a stroke. Each engine was rated at and together were designed to move the ship at , though the ship exceeded that in her trials, topping out at .

The engines, situated in separate watertight compartments, were each fed by a pair of coal-fired boilers. Each boiler was horizontally mounted and was in diameter and in length with a total grate area of . &quot;Bennington&quot;″s coal bunkers could carry up to of fuel, and were shielded from &quot;shot and shell&quot;. At a near top-speed of 16 knots, the ship could cover in days; at the more economical speed of she could cruise over 62 days.

To supplement her steam power plant, &quot;Bennington&quot; was built with three masts that were schooner-rigged. She had a total sail area of . The steam and sail combination was expected to allow &quot;Bennington&quot; to remain at sea for months at a time during wartime.

=== Armament ===
&quot;Bennington&quot;″s main battery consisted of six /30 caliber Mark 3 guns, with each gun weighing in excess of . Two were mounted on the forecastle deck, two on the poop deck, and the other pair amidships on the gun deck. The two guns on the gun deck were mounted above the waterline, while the other four were above. The guns fired armor-piercing projectiles with a propellant charge weighing at . At an elevation of 30.2°, the guns had a range of . Each gun was shielded with steel plating thick.

&quot;Bennington&quot;″s secondary battery consisted of four 6-pounder () guns, and four 1-pounder () guns. Both were based on designs of the French arms company Hotchkiss. According to a 1902 Bureau of Ordnance publication, an armor-piercing round fired from a 6-pounder gun could penetrate of armor at a distance of .

== Early career ==
USS &quot;Bennington&quot; (Gunboat No. 4) was commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 20 June 1891 under the command of Commander Royal B. Bradford. As one of the first steel-hulled gunboats of the &quot;New Navy&quot;, &quot;Bennington&quot; was assigned to the Squadron of Evolution, a unit made up entirely of &quot;New Navy&quot; ships that was established to test and perfect tactics and doctrine developed at the Naval War College. In addition to operating as the first tactical fleet of the U.S. Navy, the squadron performed the secondary mission of cruising to foreign ports to demonstrate to the world the types of modern ships the United States was capable of building. In that latter role, &quot;Bennington&quot; and the rest of the squadron departed New York on 19 November 1891 for the unit&#x27;s cruise to Brazil.

On 5 May 1892, &quot;Bennington&quot; was transferred to the South Atlantic Squadron and cruised South American waters until 19 July. Setting out from Bahia, Brazil, the gunboat visited Spanish and Italian ports during the 400th anniversary celebration of Columbus&#x27; voyage to the western hemisphere. She concluded the European portion of those festivities on 18 February 1893 when she departed Cadiz, with a replica of Columbus&#x27;s caravel &quot;Pinta&quot; in tow for Cuba. After stops in the Canary Islands, the Netherlands West Indies, and Havana, the gunboat arrived back in the United States at Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 26 March.

Following participation in the 1893 International Naval Review at Hampton Roads, &quot;Bennington&quot; moved north for operations along the coast of New England before beginning preparations for foreign service. To this end, she entered the New York Navy Yard on 24 May and remained there until 6 August. The ship departed New York on the 6th and arrived in Lisbon on the 18th. She cruised the Mediterranean, visiting various ports along its shores, for the next six months. In February 1894, orders arrived sending her to the Pacific. On the 18th, the gunboat transited the Strait of Gibraltar and headed back across the Atlantic. After steaming around Cape Horn and stopping at several Latin American ports, the warship finally arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 30 April.

== Pacific Duty ==
&quot;Bennington&quot; served in the Pacific for a little more than four years. For the most part, her duty consisted of cruising along the west coast protecting American interests in Latin America during the numerous political upheavals that occurred at that time in Central and South America. In addition, she made two extended cruises to the Hawaiian Islands. The first came after a group of pro-royalists attempted in January 1895 to stage a countercoup against the provisional government of the islands. &quot;Bennington&quot; departed Mare Island on 28 May, arrived at Honolulu on 5 June, and spent the next nine months protecting American interests in the islands. On 5 March 1896, she departed Honolulu, bound for San Francisco where she arrived on 16 March. The following day, the warship entered the Mare Island Navy Yard for five months of repairs.

On 8 August, she resumed cruises along the west coast. That employment lasted a year and a week. On 14 August 1897, Bennington headed back to Hawaii. She arrived in Lahaina Roads on 27 September and reached Honolulu on the 30th. Except for a six-day cruise back to Lahaina in March 1898, the gunboat remained at Honolulu for just over nine months.

At the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, &quot;Bennington&quot; was in Hawaiian waters. After spending the first two months of the war in the Hawaiian Islands, she departed Honolulu on 16 June and steamed to the west coast of the United States. The warship arrived in San Francisco on 26 June and patrolled the California coast for the remainder of hostilities. On 18 September, &quot;Bennington&quot; stood out of San Francisco on her way ultimately to the Philippines. She arrived in Hawaii on 27 September and devoted a little over three months to operations in nearby waters. On 7 January 1899, she resumed her voyage west. Ten days out of Honolulu, she stopped at Wake Island. There Commander Edward D. Taussig, &quot;Bennington&quot;″s commander, under direct orders from President William McKinley claimed the atoll for the United States, despite protests from Germany (which considered the island group a part of its claim of the Marshall Islands). Wake eventually became an important link in the Honolulu–Manila trans-Pacific cable. &quot;Bennington&quot; later made a stop at San Luis d&#x27;Apra, Guam, from 23 January to 15 February where Commander (later Rear Admiral) Taussig accepted the relinquishment of Guam from her Spanish colonial governor. Taussig briefly served as the first naval governor of Guam and established a native ruling council, before continuing on to Manila where &quot;Bennington&quot; arrived on 22 February.

== Philippine–American War ==
For a little more than two years after her February 1899 arrival, &quot;Bennington&quot; served in the Philippine Islands in support of the Army&#x27;s campaigns during the Philippine–American War. For the most part, her service in the islands consisted of patrol and escort duty – preventing rebel movement and stopping the importation of arms, as well as seeing American troops and supplies safely between the islands. Occasionally, &quot;Bennington&quot; did see action. On 10 September, she shelled a fort near Legaspi on the southeastern coast of Luzon. Two days later, she captured and destroyed the insurgent vessel &quot;Parao&quot;. Between 7 and 9 November, the warship supported an Army landing at San Fabian on the shores of Lingayen Gulf in northwestern Luzon. The gunboat began a four-month assignment as station ship at Cebu on 26 November and concluded that duty on 19 March 1900.

After visiting Cavite on Luzon, the gunboat headed for Japan on 3 April and underwent repairs there from 9 April to 19 May before heading back to the Philippines. The warship arrived at Cavite on 27 May and resumed patrols on 3 June. She spent another seven months conducting patrols in the Philippines and supporting the Army&#x27;s operations in the island chain. On 3 January 1901, she departed Cavite and shaped a course for Hong Kong. The gunboat arrived in that British colony on the 6th and began over six months of repairs. At the completion of that work, she departed Hong Kong on 25 June. After a visit to Shanghai, the warship headed back to the United States in July and arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 19 August. She was decommissioned there on 5 September 1901.

While she was out of commission at Mare Island, &quot;Bennington&quot; was refitted. A pilothouse that had been added on top of her bridge and a spotlight platform on her bow – both added in 1893–94 – were removed. &quot;Bennington&quot;″s mainmast was also removed, leaving her as a two-mast rig. In addition, two tall ventilation cowls were added immediately behind the bridge. After 18 months of inactivity, &quot;Bennington&quot; was recommissioned on 2 March 1903 under the command of Commander Chauncey Thomas.

Over the next 27 months, &quot;Bennington&quot; cruised in the eastern Pacific along the coasts of North and South America. The warship visited Alaskan ports in the summer of 1903 and the coast of Central America the following fall and winter. In May 1904, she steamed to Hawaii and then proceeded to the Aleutians in June. The winter of 1904 and 1905 saw her voyage south for visits to Pacific ports in Central and South America. In February 1905, she departed San Francisco for a two-month cruise to the Hawaiian Islands, returning to San Diego on 19 July, after a difficult 17-day voyage.

== Boiler explosion ==
On the morning of 21 July 1905, &quot;Bennington&quot;″s crew was preparing her to sail to the aid of the monitor which had broken down and was in need of a tow. After her crew had finished the difficult task of coaling the ship that morning, most of them were belowdecks cleaning themselves from the dirty job. Unbeknownst to anyone on board, three problems with one of &quot;Bennington&quot;″s boilers – oily feed water, an improperly closed steam valve, and a faulty steam gauge – were conspiring against them. At about 10:30, excessive steam pressure in the boiler resulted in a boiler explosion that rocked the ship, sending men and equipment flying into the air. The escaping steam sprayed through the living compartments and decks. The explosion opened &quot;Bennington&quot;″s hull to the sea, and she began to list to starboard. Quick actions by the tug &quot;Santa Fe&quot; – taking &quot;Bennington&quot; under tow and beaching her – almost certainly saved the gunboat from sinking.

The combination of the explosion and the scalding steam killed a number of men outright and left others mortally wounded; the final death toll was one officer and sixty-five men, making it one of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s worst peacetime disasters. Nearly all of the forty-six who survived had an injury of some sort; eleven of the survivors were awarded the Medal of Honor for &quot;extraordinary heroism displayed at the time of the explosion&quot;. One of the survivors was John Henry Turpin, an African-American who had also survived the explosion of in Havana in February 1898 and was, reportedly, the only man to survive both explosions. The sheer number of casualties – the death toll exceeded the U.S. Navy&#x27;s death toll for the entirety of the Spanish–American War – overwhelmed San Diego&#x27;s medical facilities, and many burn victims had to be cared for in makeshift facilities tended by volunteers.

The number of dead also taxed the morticians in San Diego, who were hard-pressed to prepare all of the victims for burial. On 23 July, two days after the explosion, the majority of those killed were buried in the cemetery at Fort Rosecrans. The victims are commemorated by the USS &quot;Bennington&quot; Monument, a granite obelisk dedicated in the cemetery on 7 January 1908.

In spite of rumors of misconduct by &quot;Bennington&quot;″s engineering crewmen, an official investigation concluded that the explosion was not due to negligence on the part of the crew.

=== List of Medal of Honor recipients from explosion ===

The eleven men who were awarded the Medal of Honor for &quot;extraordinary heroism displayed at the time of the explosion&quot; were:
* Edward William Boers, Seaman
* George F. Brock, Carpenter&#x27;s Mate Second Class
* Raymond E. Davis, Quartermaster Third Class
* John J. Clausey, Chief Gunner&#x27;s Mate (retired as a Lieutenant (O-3) after World War I)
* Willie Cronan, Boatswain&#x27;s Mate (retired as Lieutenant Commander (O-4) after World War II)
* Emil Fredericksen, Watertender
* Rade Grbitch, Seaman
* Frank E. Hill, Ship&#x27;s Cook First Class
* Oscar Frederick Nelson, Machinist&#x27;s Mate First Class
* Otto Diller Schmidt, Seaman
* William Sidney Shacklette, Hospital Steward

Also aboard was John Henry Turpin, an African-American sailor who was aboard the USS &quot;Maine&quot; when she exploded in Havana harbor in 1898 and would go on to become one of the first African-American Chief Petty Officers in the U.S. Navy.

== Disposition ==
After the explosion, &quot;Bennington&quot; was refloated and towed to the Mare Island Navy Yard. Because of the extent of the damage and the age of the ship, &quot;Bennington&quot; was not repaired but was instead decommissioned on 31 October 1905. After five years of inactivity, &quot;Bennington&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 10 September 1910 and sold for scrap on 14 November. &quot;Bennington&quot; was not scrapped but was purchased in 1913 by the Matson Line for use as a molasses barge. She was towed to Honolulu and remained in use there from 1913 until 1924, when she was scuttled off Oahu.

<doc id="208536" wikidata="Q5869170" url="?curid=208536" title="History of the British penny (1901–1970)">
<text>The British penny ( of a pound sterling), a large, pre-decimal coin which continued the series of pennies which began in about the year 700, was struck intermittently during the 20th century until its withdrawal from circulation after 1970. From 1901 to 1970, the obverse (&quot;heads&quot; side) of the bronze coin depicted the monarch who was reigning at the start of the year. The reverse, which featured an image of Britannia seated with shield, trident, and helm, was created by Leonard Charles Wyon based on an earlier design by his father, William Wyon. The coins were also used in British colonies and dominions that had not issued their own coins.

In 1895 the design on the reverse was modified by the Engraver of the Royal Mint George William de Saulles and after Queen Victoria&#x27;s death in 1901, de Saulles was called upon to create a design for the obverse which would feature Edward VII. This feature appeared on the version of the penny which went into circulation in 1902, and it remained in circulation until the year of Edward&#x27;s death, 1910. An obverse version of the penny designed by Sir Bertram Mackennal and depicting George V went into circulation in 1911, and it remained in circulation with some modifications until the year of the king&#x27;s death, 1936. No new pennies were produced for commerce in 1933, because a sufficient number were already in circulation, but at least seven were struck that year, mostly for placement beneath foundation stones and in museums; today they are valuable. Edward VIII&#x27;s short reign is only represented by a single pattern coin, dated 1937. That year, a new obverse design by Humphrey Paget which depicted George VI went into use. From 1941 to 1943, during the Second World War, pennies were only struck for the colonies; these are all dated 1940 which was the most recent year of production in the United Kingdom. After the war, demand for the penny began to diminish. Most of the 1950 and 1951 pieces were sent to Bermuda, where many of them were retrieved from circulation and repatriated by British coin dealers because of their relative scarcity.

Although commerce did not require them in 1953, pennies which bore the likeness of Elizabeth II were minted in sets which were sold to the public, using an obverse design by Mary Gillick. One 1954 penny was struck, for internal Mint purposes. By 1961, new pennies were needed again for circulation, and they were produced in large numbers. The officials who planned to introduce decimalisation in the 1960s did not favour keeping the large bronze penny, the value of which had been eroded by inflation. The last pennies which went into circulation were dated 1967—a final proof set was dated 1970. The old pennies quickly went out of use after Decimal Day, 15 February 1971—there was no exact decimal equivalent of them, and the slogan &quot;use your old pennies in sixpenny lots&quot; explained that pennies and &quot;threepenny bits&quot; were only accepted in shops if their total value was six old pence (exactly new pence). The old penny was demonetised on 31 August of that year.

== Edward VII (pennies struck 1902–1910) ==
Following the death of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901, officials at the Royal Mint planned for new coins, to bear the image of her son and successor, Edward VII. New coin designs had been introduced in the 1890s, and Mint officials believed the British people wanted as few changes to the coinage as possible. Thus, it was decided not to alter the reverses of the three bronze coins (the penny, halfpenny and farthing), as a new portrait of the Queen had been introduced in 1895. At that time, the Engraver of the Royal Mint, George William de Saulles, had modified Leonard Charles Wyon&#x27;s depiction of Britannia on the reverse of the bronze coins—the lighthouse and sailing ship that had flanked her were removed. De Saulles was tasked with creating a depiction of Edward for the King&#x27;s new coinage. The Mint continued to strike coins depicting Victoria, dated 1901, until the King&#x27;s coinage was ready in May 1902.

The King sat for de Saulles twice, in February and June 1901, and the engraver also used a drawing of Edward by court painter Emil Fuchs. The unadorned bust of the King that resulted is in low relief, as de Saulles sought a coin that would be easy for the Royal Mint to strike. Even so, the relatively large size of the head caused metal flow problems for the penny once issued, resulting in &quot;ghosting&quot;, a faint outline of the obverse design visible on the reverse. On 20 August 1901, the Mint received confirmation that the de Saulles bust of Edward would be used on all coins. The new bronze coins were made current by a proclamation dated 10 December 1901, effective 1 January 1902.

Edward&#x27;s pennies were minted to the same standard as the final Victorian issues: 95 percent copper, 4 percent tin and 1 percent zinc, and, like all bronze pennies from 1860 until 1970, they weigh an average of and have a diameter of . The head faces right on the Edward VII coins, with the inscription . The reverse shows the seated Britannia surrounded by , with the date at the bottom of the coin; this design remained largely unchanged until the coin&#x27;s demise after 1970. Pennies were struck with Edward&#x27;s bust from 1902 to 1910. There are two varieties of 1902-dated pennies, &quot;high tide&quot; and &quot;low tide&quot;, due to a decision to raise the apparent water level around Britannia.

== George V (struck 1911–1936) ==

The death of de Saulles in 1903 had led to the abolition of the post of Engraver, and coins for George V, who took the throne on Edward&#x27;s death in 1910, were subject to a design competition won by Bertram Mackennal, who also prepared the medal for the Coronation. The King apparently liked his work, as he was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order in 1911 and knighted in 1921. The inscription around the left-facing bust reads , while no significant change was made to the reverse design. The new bronze coins were made current by proclamation dated 28 November 1910, effective 1 January 1911.

In addition to those struck at the Royal Mint, in 1912, 1918 and 1919 some pennies were produced at the Heaton Mint in Birmingham, and are identified by an &quot;H&quot; mint mark to the left of the date. In 1918 and 1919 some were produced at the Kings Norton Metal Co. Ltd, also in Birmingham, and have a &quot;KN&quot; there instead. Both firms also provided blanks to the Royal Mint for striking into pennies from 1912 to 1919. This was due to high demand for small change, initially caused by the 1911 implementation of the National Insurance Act by the Asquith government, and thereafter by the war years. Also feeding the demand for pennies were automatic slot machines, a trend noticed as early as 1898. To reduce the number of worn pieces in commerce, the Royal Mint had in 1908 agreed to accept the return of worn pre-1895 pennies and halfpennies through banks and post offices, and from 1922, pieces dated 1860 to 1894 would be redeemed in any condition, though they remained acceptable in circulation. The pre-1860 copper penny had been demonetised after 1869 in Britain (though accepted at full face value by the Mint until 1873) and in 1877 for the colonies.

King George&#x27;s pennies were produced in the same alloy as before until 1922, but the following year the composition of bronze coins was set at 95.5 percent copper, 3 percent tin, and 1.5 percent zinc, although the weight remained at and the diameter . This alloy was slightly more malleable; the lessened force needed to strike pennies helped minimise ghosting. No pennies were struck for the years 1923, 1924 or 1925; this was due to lack of demand as the interwar years saw alternating gluts and shortages of pennies. In 1928, the King&#x27;s portrait was reduced in size, effectively eliminating the ghosting problem. The inscription around the three variations of the left-facing head remained , while Britannia remained on the reverse, as before, though that design was slightly modified in 1922.

By the end of George&#x27;s reign, in 1936, the bronze penny, which had felt lighter in weight compared with older coppers when the alloy was first used for it in 1860, was regarded as weighty and cumbersome, the heaviest bronze coin in circulation in Europe. The weight when in bulk caused problems for business; the London Passenger Transport Board received 6,000 tonnes of pennies, halfpennies and farthings a year. A reduction of size for the penny was deemed impractical, given the time it would take to recoin the 3,000,000,000 pennies in circulation, and because many automatic machines that took pennies would have to be reconfigured. The major response would be the 1937 debut of the brass threepence coin. This twelve-sided piece was introduced since threepence worth of pennies or halfpennies was heavy and inconvenient, and the silver threepenny bit was deemed too small.

=== 1933 rarity ===
There was no need for the Mint to produce any pennies in 1933 because there was no commercial demand, and it held plenty of stock. There was a custom at that time for the King to place a set of coins of the current year under the foundation stone of important new buildings, and the Mint struck three 1933 pennies for this purpose, also one each for its own museum and for the British Museum, and at least two others. The result was a rarity that people thought might turn up in their pocket change, and that is probably the best-known British rare coin.
The precise number struck was not recorded at the time; seven are known to exist. One of the 1933 pennies sold in 2016 for US$193,875 (£149,364 at the time). The known 1933 pennies are to be found in the Royal Mint Museum, the British Museum, under the Senate House of the University of London (placed there by King George in 1933), with three now in private collections, and one that was stolen, its whereabouts unknown. The missing coin was placed in 1933 under the foundation stone of Church of St Cross, Middleton, Leeds; it was stolen in August 1970 during the church&#x27;s reconstruction, by thieves who managed to remove the set of coins from beneath the church. To prevent possible further theft, John Moorman, Bishop of Ripon, ordered that the 1933 penny placed under St Mary&#x27;s Church, Hawksworth Wood, Kirkstall, Leeds, be unearthed and sold, which it was. As far as is known, the penny under Senate House is still in place. Two others in private hands were sold at auctions in 1969 and 2016 respectively.

Four pattern coins were also made, bearing similar designs to official coins but prepared by sculptor André Lavrillier at the Royal Mint&#x27;s request. These were rejected by the Standing Committee on Coins, Medals and Decorations in December 1932. One sold at auction on 4 May 2016 for £72,000.

== Edward VIII pattern (dated 1937) ==

No coins of King Edward VIII (1936) were officially issued, but a penny does exist, dated 1937. It is a pattern coin, one produced for royal approval which it would probably have been due to receive about the time that the King abdicated. The obverse, by Humphrey Paget, shows a left-facing portrait of the King, who considered this to be his best side, and wished to break the tradition of alternating with each change of reign the direction in which the monarch faces on coins. The inscription on the obverse is .

When the Royal Mint&#x27;s Advisory Committee were considering the question of new designs for King Edward&#x27;s coinage, they did not favour a new look for the penny. Rather, they sought the return of the lighthouse and ship, seen in the distance on either side of Britannia on pre-1895 pennies, but with the sailing ship seen on Victorian pennies replaced with a modern warship. Officials felt this too aggressive at a delicate international time, and the ship was not restored, but the lighthouse was placed on Edward&#x27;s patterns, and would be kept on the penny until its abolition after 1970.

== George VI (struck 1937–1952) ==
King George VI&#x27;s new coins were made current by a proclamation dated 18 March 1937, which went into force immediately. Although the customary Britannia motif was retained for the penny, the halfpenny and farthing were given their own designs.

George&#x27;s pennies (1937–1952) have a left-facing bust of him, also by Paget, with the inscription (to 1948) , and (from 1949) , removing the Latin abbreviation for &quot;Emperor of India&quot; after that nation had gained independence. Pennies were produced for circulation dated 1937–1940, and 1944–1951, although when necessary pennies were produced for the colonies in 1941–1943 using the 1940 dies. These went principally to Gibraltar and the British West Indies.

Although the 2000 edition of the Coincraft catalogue of British coins says the wartime pause was due to a surplus of pennies, numismatist Kerry Rodgers, in his 2016 article on the currency emergency in Fiji during the Second World War, cited a colonial legislative record to the effect that it was to conserve copper for munitions. Beginning with the 1942 production of 1940-dated pennies, the composition was altered, as tin was a critical war material, rare because most of it came from Malaya, so pennies from then until later in 1945 are 97 percent copper, 0.5 percent tin, and 2.5 percent zinc. Such coins tarnish to a colour different than the prewar coins, and they were treated with sodium thiosulphate to give them a darker tone. That substance, dubbed &quot;hypo&quot;, had been used to darken all 1934 pennies before issue and most of the 1935 mintage, &quot;Hypo&quot; would be used again in 1946, discolouring the coins to discourage the hoarding of new pennies. Although the prewar alloy was restored in 1945, the Mint reversed itself in 1959, made pennies out of that wartime composition for the remainder of the coin&#x27;s pre-decimal history without chemical treatment, and continued its use for the new decimal bronze pieces.

By the late 1940s, demand for pennies was falling in Britain, likely due to the popularity of the lighter, more convenient, brass threepence coin, which weighed less than a quarter of the same value in bronze coins. The immediate aftermath of the war had seen a strong demand for pennies until January 1949, when it dropped off and, in May of that year, the Royal Mint stopped the coin&#x27;s production. Officials concluded that the fall in demand was permanent due to inflation; its purchasing power was minimal, and many automatic machines no longer took it. The Royal Mint redeemed surplus coppers from the banks for melting beginning in 1951, and by the end of the decade, some £1.2 million worth had been removed from circulation.

The 1950 and 1951 circulation pennies were produced only for the colonies as none were needed in Britain. During 1956, the entire 1950 mintage (still held in stock in Britain) and three-quarters of the 1951 production were sent to Bermuda. Both mintages were low compared with earlier George VI pennies, and London dealers descended on the islands, offering a pound a coin. Collecting coins by date (especially the penny) became popular in the early 1960s; after many bold claims about the investment potential of the 1951 penny were made, the coin acquired something of a cult status. One 1952 penny believed to be unique was struck by the Royal Mint.

== Elizabeth II and end of series (1953–1970) ==

The series of pennies worth of a pound concludes with the pre-decimalisation issues for Queen Elizabeth II. No major change was made to the reverse designs of the penny or other bronze coins with the new reign, and her coins were made current by a proclamation of 25 November 1952, effective 1 January 1953. No pennies were struck for circulation in 1953, the only extant denomination between the farthing and half crown not to see a circulation issue. This was because of the large number of pennies in circulation. Specimen sets, including the penny, were issued for the Queen&#x27;s Coronation that year, with the obverse of each coin inscribed around the right-facing bust of the Queen by Mary Gillick. These were not issued for circulation, but as the specimen sets were sold for only a slight advance on face value, many were later broken open and spent. In all subsequent mintings of the penny, the inscription was . The deletion of the Latin for &quot;Queen of all the Britains&quot; in favour of designating her simply as &quot;Queen&quot; was due to the changing nature of the British Commonwealth, which by then included some republics.

One 1954 penny is known, struck for die-testing purposes at the Royal Mint, and intended for melting, but recovered from circulation. By the end of the 1950s, the price of metal ensured that every bronze coin was struck at a loss; the Mint hoped for a reduction in size, and the demonetisation of the farthing at the end of 1960 helped clear the way for such a scheme. It was not until 1961 that there was a need for more pennies to be minted, and production continued each year in very large numbers until the final pre-decimal pennies for circulation, dated 1967, were coined.

The old bronze penny was slated for elimination as decimal currency was planned in the 1960s. It continued to be struck after 1967, still bearing that date. The 97 percent copper, 0.5 percent tin, 2.5 percent zinc alloy was used again for the 1960s pennies. Finally, there was an issue of proof quality coins dated 1970 for collectors, to bid farewell to a denomination which had served the country well for 1200 years. The longstanding depiction of Britannia on the penny was translated by sculptor Christopher Ironside to the post-decimal fifty-pence coin.

The Decimal Currency Board had anticipated the need for a transition of up to 18 months after Decimal Day, 15 February 1971, but the &quot;old penny&quot; quickly vanished from circulation and it ceased to be legal tender after 31 August 1971. It had been the last survivor of the three bronze coins, as the halfpenny had been withdrawn in 1969. With decimalisation the new penny carried a value of 1/100 of a pound, 2.4 times the value of its predecessor.

<text>The Mall () is a ceremonial route and roadway in the City of Westminster, central London, that travels between Buckingham Palace at its western end and Trafalgar Square via Admiralty Arch to the east. Along the north side of The Mall is green space and St. James&#x27;s Palace with other official buildings, and to the south is St James&#x27;s Park. Near the east end at Trafalgar Square and Whitehall it is met by Horse Guards Road and Spring Gardens, near the west end at the Victoria Memorial it is met by the Constitution Hill roadway and the Spur Road to the street of Buckingham Gate. It is closed to traffic on Saturdays, Sundays, public holidays and on ceremonial occasions.

==History==

The Mall began as part of the tended grounds of St James&#x27;s Palace, and when pall-mall became popular, as a field for playing the game. In the 17th and 18th centuries it was a fashionable promenade, bordered by trees. It was envisioned as a ceremonial route in the early 20th century, matching the creation of similar ceremonial routes in other cities such as Berlin, Mexico City, Oslo, Paris, Saint Petersburg, Vienna and Washington, D.C. These routes were intended to be used for major national ceremonies. As part of this development – designed by Aston Webb – a new façade was constructed for Buckingham Palace to face down the Mall, and the Victoria Memorial was erected.
The Victoria Memorial is immediately before the gates of the Palace, whilst Admiralty Arch at the far end leads into Trafalgar Square. The length of The Mall from where it joins Constitution Hill at the Victoria Memorial end to Admiralty Arch is exactly . St. James&#x27;s Park is on the south side of The Mall, opposite Green Park and St James&#x27;s Palace, on the north side. Running off The Mall at its eastern end is Horse Guards Parade, where the Trooping the Colour ceremony is held.

The surface of The Mall has been coloured red since the 1950s giving the effect of a giant red carpet leading up to Buckingham Palace. This colour was obtained using synthetic iron oxide pigment from Deanshanger Oxide Works (Deanox), which was created using the Deanox Process devised by chemist Ernest Lovell. David Eccles, as Minister of Works from 1951 to 1954, chose the colour.

On Victory in Europe Day (8 May 1945), the Palace was the centre of British celebrations, with the King, Queen and Princess Elizabeth (the future queen) and Princess Margaret appearing on the balcony, with the Palace&#x27;s blacked-out windows behind them, to the cheers from a vast crowd on The Mall.

During state visits, the monarch and the visiting head of state are escorted in a state carriage up The Mall and the street is decorated with Union Flags and the flags of the visiting head of state&#x27;s country. During the Golden Jubilee celebrations of Queen Elizabeth II in 2002, over one million people packed The Mall to watch the public displays and the appearance of the Royal Family on the palace balcony.

Scheduled buses are not allowed to use the Mall and go past Buckingham Palace except by permission of the monarch. This has only happened twice in history; in 1927 and in 1950.

==Events==

The annual London Marathon finishes on The Mall. It was also the start and finish line for the marathon course, the road race and the race walks of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The women&#x27;s marathon took place on 5 August and the men&#x27;s Olympic marathon on 12 August. The men&#x27;s 20 km walk took place on 4 August, with the men&#x27;s 50 km walk and women&#x27;s 20 km walk took place on 11 August. The Paralympic marathons were held on 9 September. In recent years the Mall has also been repeatedly used as the finishing line for UK cycling events, including the 2012 Olympics Road Races, the Ride London Prudential Classic in 2013, and stage 3 of the 2014 Tour de France. The opening ceremony for the 2019 Cricket World Cup was held on The Mall.

During the Trooping the Colour events and other big National events, the Mall is used.

==Starting pistol incident==
In 1981, Marcus Sarjeant fired six blank shots from a starting pistol near Queen Elizabeth II as she and her entourage were making their way down the road on horseback for Trooping the Colour. Sarjeant was immediately apprehended and arrested.

<doc id="208539" wikidata="Q290249" url="?curid=208539" title="Marie Laveau">
<text>Marie Catherine Laveau (September 10, 1801 – June 15, 1881) was a Louisiana Creole practitioner of Voodoo, herbalist and midwife who was renowned in New Orleans. Her daughter, Marie Laveau II (1827 – ), also practiced rootwork, conjure, Native American and African spiritualism as well as Louisiana Voodoo and traditional Roman Catholicism. An alternate spelling of her name, Laveaux, is considered by historians to be from the original French spelling.

==Early life==
Historical records state that Marie Catherine Laveau was born a free woman of color in New Orleans French Quarter, Louisiana, on Thursday, September 10, 1801. At the time of her birth, Louisiana was still administered by Spanish colonial officials, although by treaty the territory had been restored to the French First Republic a year prior. Her mother Marguerite D&#x27;Arcantel was a free woman of African, European, and Native American ancestry. Because Laveau&#x27;s mother was not married at the time of her birth, her father was not identified on her 1801 baptismal record. A possible candidate is Charles Laveau, the son of Charles Laveau Trudeau, a white Louisiana creole and politician. Other historians claim that Laveau&#x27;s father was a free man of color named Charles Laveaux. Much of the confusion is due to inconsistent spellings in surviving records.

On August 4, 1819, she married Jacques Paris (also known as Santiago Paris in Spanish records), a free man of color who was among the thousands of émigrés from Saint-Domingue to New Orleans in the wake of the Haitian Revolution. Their marriage certificate is preserved in the St. Louis Cathedral in New Orleans. The wedding mass was performed by Father Antonio de Sedella, the Capuchin priest known as Père Antoine. The couple had two daughters, Félicité (b. 1817) and Angèle (b. 1822), who are presumed to have died in childhood. Paris worked as a carpenter in New Orleans until 1822; after which he disappears from city records. He is believed to have died in Baton Rouge in 1823. On Félicité&#x27;s 1824 baptismal certificate, Laveau is referred to as &quot;the Widow Paris&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Following the reported death of her husband Jacques Paris, she entered a domestic partnership with Christophe Dominick Duminy de Glapion, a nobleman of French descent, with whom she lived until his death in 1855. They were reported to have had 15 children (it is unclear if that includes children &quot;and grandchildren&quot;). They had seven children according to birth and baptismal records: François-Auguste Glapion, Marie-Louise &quot;Caroline&quot; Glapion, Marie-Angélie Paris, Célestin Albert Glapion, Arcange Glapion, Félicité Paris, Marie-Philomène Glapion, and Marie-Héloïse Eucharist Glapion. Only Marie-Héloïse and Marie-Philomène survived into adulthood.

Marie Laveau is confirmed to have owned at least seven slaves during her lifetime.

During her life Marie Laveau was known to have attended to prisoners who were sentenced to death. Rumors circulated that some prisoners would receive poisons or other substances before going to the gallows, but this was never proven. A reporter from the &quot;New Orleans Republican&quot; detailed one such visit in an article published on May 14, 1871, in which he describes Marie Laveau as a “devout and acceptable member of the Catholic communion.&quot; Following her death, her daughter Philomène confirmed during an interview with a reporter from the &quot;Picayune&quot; that only Catholic traditions would take place during these visits, and that her mother would also prepare the men&#x27;s last meal and pray with them. Marie Laveau also sought pardons or commutations of sentences for those she favored and was often successful in her efforts.

She was known to care for the sick in her community during the yellow fever epidemic of 1878 by providing herbal remedies and prayers for the afflicted. Her other community activities included visiting prisoners, providing lessons to the women of the community, and doing rituals for those in need without charge.

==Career==
Marie Laveau was a dedicated practitioner of Voodoo, a healer, an herbalist, and an entrepreneur. Laveau was also known as a prominent female religious leader and community activist.

Laveau started a beauty parlor where she was a hair-dresser for the wealthier families of New Orleans. She excelled at obtaining inside information on her wealthy patrons at the beauty parlor by listening to ladies gossiping, or from their servants whom she either paid or cured of mysterious ailments. She used this information during her Voodoo consultations with wealthy Orleanian women to enhance her image as a clairvoyant; and used this intel to give them practical advice. She also made money by selling her clients gris gris as charms to help their wishes come true.

In her role as a Voodoo practitioner, customers often appealed to Laveau for help with family disputes, health, finances, and more. Laveau performed her services in three main places: her own home on St. Ann Street, within Congo Square, and at Lake Pontchartrain. She was the third female leader of Voodoo in New Orleans (the first was Sanité Dédé, who ruled for a few years before being usurped by Marie Saloppé), a New Orleans voodoo &quot;queen&quot;, or priestess. Marie Laveau maintained her authority throughout her leadership, although there was an attempt to challenge her in 1850. Due to her strong influence, New Orleans Voodoo lost a large number of adherents after her death. Her daughter, Marie Laveau II displayed more theatrical rubrics by holding public events (including inviting attendees to St. John&#x27;s Eve rituals on Bayou St. John).

Of Laveau&#x27;s magical career, there is little that can be substantiated, including whether or not she had a snake she named Zombi after an African god, whether the occult part of her magic mixed Roman Catholic saints with African spirits, and Native American Spiritualism.

==Death==

Marie Catherine Laveau Paris Glapion died on June 15, 1881, aged 79. The different spellings of her surname result from many different women with the same name in New Orleans at the time, and her age at death from conflicting accounts of her birth date.

On June 17, 1881, it was announced in the &quot;Daily Picayune&quot; that Marie Laveau had died peacefully in her home. According to the Louisiana Writer&#x27;s Project, her funeral was lavish and attended by a diverse audience including members of the white elite. Oral tradition states that she was seen by some people in town after her supposed demise. News of her death was featured in a number of newspapers, including the &quot;Staunton Spectator&quot; in Virginia, the &quot;Omaha Daily Bee&quot; in Nebraska, as well as several newspapers published in Minnesota.

At least two of her daughters were named Marie, following the French Catholic tradition to have the first names of daughters be Marie, and boys Joseph, then each use middle name as the common name. One of her daughters named Marie possibly assumed her position, with her name, and carried on her magical practice, taking over as the queen soon before or after the first Marie&#x27;s death. Malvina Latour has also been reported as being Laveau&#x27;s successor.

==Legacy==

Laveau&#x27;s name and her history have been surrounded by legend and lore. She is generally believed to have been buried in plot 347, the Glapion family crypt in Saint Louis Cemetery No. 1, New Orleans, but this has been disputed by Robert Tallant, a journalist who used her as a character in historical novels. Tourists continue to visit and some draw X marks in accordance with a decades-old tradition that if people wanted Laveau to grant them a wish, they had to draw three X&#x27;s on the tomb, turn around three times, knock on the tomb, yell out their wish, and if it was granted, come back, circle their X, and leave Laveau an offering.

In 1982, New Jersey–based punk rock group The Misfits were arrested and accused of attempting to exhume Laveau from her grave after a local concert. The arrest took place in nearby Cemetery No. 2 and there are conflicting accounts of the incident.

The tomb in Saint Louis Cemetery No. 1 was vandalized by an unknown person on December 17, 2013, by being painted over with pink latex paint. The paint was removed because the structure is made of old plaster and the latex paint would seal in the moisture that would destroy the plaster. Some historical preservation experts criticized officials of the Archdiocese of New Orleans, who maintain the cemetery, for their decision to use pressure washing rather than paint stripper to remove it. After the cleaning, the archdiocese and local nonprofit Save Our Cemeteries collaborated over three months in 2014 to restore the tomb. The project removed crumbling plaster, rebuilt the roof, and added several coats of new plaster and lime wash. During the restorations, however, the project was plagued by tomb visitors scratching X marks into the new plaster.

 there is no longer public access to St. Louis Cemetery No. 1. Entry with a tour guide is required because of continued vandalism and the destruction of tombs. This change was made by the Archdiocese of New Orleans to protect the tombs of the Laveau family as well as those of the many other dead interred there.

Although some references to Marie Laveau in popular culture refer to her as a &quot;witch,&quot; she has also been called a &quot;Voudou Priestess&quot;, and she is frequently described as a &#x27;Voodoo queen&#x27;. At the time of her death, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New Orleans Daily Picayune&quot;, the &quot;Daily States&quot; and other news sources describe her as &quot;woman of great beauty, intellect, and charisma who was also pious, charitable, and a skilled herbal healer.&quot;

==Artistic legacy and in popular culture==
Due to her prominence within the history of Voodoo in New Orleans, Laveau has inspired a number of artistic renditions. In visual art, the African American artist Renee Stout often uses Laveau as a visual motif.

Despite never being photographed or having sat for a painter, multiple 19th century paintings of unidentified Creole women have been labeled as a portrait of Marie Laveau. By the 1940s, it was common for any portrait of an unidentified woman of color wearing a tignon to be identified as a portrait of Laveau. A copy made around 1915 of &quot;Portrait of a Creole Woman with Madras Tignon&quot; (, attributed to George Catlin) in the collection of the Louisiana State Museum was long labeled as a &quot;Portrait of Marie Laveau&quot;.

Numerous songs about Marie Laveau have been recorded, including &quot;Marie La Veau&quot; by Papa Celestin; &quot;Marie Laveau&quot; written by Shel Silverstein and Baxter Taylor and recorded by Dr. Hook &amp; the Medicine Show (1972), and Bobby Bare (1974); &quot;The Witch Queen of New Orleans&quot; (1971) by Redbone; &quot;Dixie Drug Store&quot; by Grant Lee Buffalo; &quot;X Marks the Spot (Marie Laveau)&quot; by Joe Sample; &quot;Marie Laveau&quot; by Dr. John; &quot;Marie Laveau&quot; (2013) by Tao Of Sound; &quot;Voodoo Queen Marie&quot; to the minstrel tune &quot;Colored Aristocracy&quot; by The Holy Modal Rounders; &quot;The Witch Queen of New Orleans&quot; by Total Toly; &quot;The Widow Paris&quot; by The Get Up Kids; &quot;Marie Laveau&quot; by the Danish metal band Volbeat; and &quot;The Widow Paris&quot; by Lester T. Raww&#x27;s Graveside Quartet.

Laveau is mentioned in the songs &quot;I Will Play for Gumbo&quot; (1999) by Jimmy Buffett, &quot;Clare&quot; by Fairground Attraction, and &quot;Rabbits Foot&quot; by Turbowolf. Two of Laveau&#x27;s nephews, banjo player Raymond Glapion and bassist Alcide &quot;Slow Drag&quot; Pavageau, became prominent New Orleans jazz musicians. The Los Angeles blues band Canned Heat featured a five-minute instrumental called &quot;Marie Laveau&quot; on their second album Boogie With Canned Heat (1968), written by and featuring their lead guitarist Henry Vestine.

A musical from 1999, &quot;Marie Christine&quot;, is also based on the life of Laveau.

Laveau has offered inspiration for a number of fictional characters as well. She is the protagonist of such novels as Robert Tallant&#x27;s &quot;The Voodoo Queen&quot; (1956); Francine Prose&#x27;s &quot;Marie Laveau&quot; (1977); and Jewell Parker Rhodes&#x27; &quot;Voodoo Dreams: A Novel of Marie Laveau&quot; (1993). Laveau appears as a supporting character in the Night Huntress novels by Jeaniene Frost as a powerful ghoul still living in New Orleans in the 21st century. She also appears as a background character in Barbara Hambly&#x27;s Benjamin January mystery series, set in New Orleans. Marie Laveau appears in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s novel &quot;American Gods&quot;, under her married name, Marie Paris. Marie Laveau&#x27;s tomb is the site of a secret, fictional underground Voodoo workshop in the Caster Chronicles novel &quot;Beautiful Chaos&quot; by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl. Laveau&#x27;s gravesite is the setting of a pivotal scene in Robert J. Randisi&#x27;s short story, &quot;Cold As The Gun,&quot; from &quot;Foreshadows The Ghosts of Zero&quot;. The mother of Hazel Levesque, one of the characters from Rick Riordan&#x27;s &quot;The Heroes of Olympus&quot; book series, was known as &quot;Queen Marie,&quot; a famous fortune-teller who lived in New Orleans. In Charlaine Harris&#x27;s &quot;True Blood&quot; (Sookie Stackhouse novels) book series, the character Hadley is lured to her death at the site of Marie Laveau&#x27;s tomb.

A character named Marie Laveau, based loosely on the real Marie Laveau appears in Marvel Comics. She first appeared in &quot;&quot;Dracula Lives&quot; #2&quot; in 1973. She is depicted as a powerful sorceress and Voodoo priestess with great magical powers and knowledge of arcane lore, including the creation of a potion made from vampire&#x27;s blood that keeps her eternally youthful and beautiful. A character named Marie Laveau also appears in the Italian comic book &quot;Zagor&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Bennington&quot; (CV/CVA/CVS-20) was an in service with the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946 and from 1952 to 1970. She was sold for scrap in 1994.

==Service history==

===World War II===
USS &quot;Bennington&quot; was named for a battle in 1777 near Bennington, Vermont, during the American Revolutionary War, in which American victory contributed to the ultimate defeat of General Burgoyne at Saratoga. The carrier was laid down on 15 December 1942 by the New York Naval Shipyard and launched on 26 February 1944, sponsored by the wife of Congressman Melvin Maas of Minnesota. She was commissioned on 6 August 1944, Captain James B. Sykes in command.

&quot;Bennington&quot; completed trials, shakedown training, and post-shakedown availability by 14 December when she departed New York and headed for the Pacific theater. She transited the Panama Canal on 21 December and moored at San Diego on the 29th. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1945, the carrier stood out of San Diego to continue her voyage west. She arrived in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 7 January. For the remainder of the month, she conducted air and gunnery training in the Hawaiian operating area. On 1 February, &quot;Bennington&quot; exited Pearl Harbor in company with the aircraft carriers , , , and the large cruiser to join Task Force 58 at Ulithi Atoll in the Caroline Islands.

====Operations off Iwo Jima====
She arrived in Ulithi lagoon on 8 February and became a unit of Task Group (TG) 58.1. The aircraft carrier remained at Ulithi only two days, departing the atoll with TG 58.1 on the 10th to make air attacks on the Japanese home islands in support of the landings on Iwo Jima. Task Force 58 steamed first to the vicinity of the Marianas to conduct rehearsals over Tinian before heading north. After the air groups carried out the training sorties on 12 February, the ships fueled at sea on the 14th and then headed toward the launching point some 200 km southeast of Tokyo. On the 16th, TF 58 launched its air strikes on Japan proper. &quot;Bennington&quot; aviators went after targets both at Tokyo and at Yokosuka, site of the large Japanese naval base. While their colleagues pounded Japan, pilots in &quot;Bennington&quot;″s Combat Air Patrol (CAP) helped to protect TG 58.1 from air raids and shot down three intruders. On the negative side, her air group lost one plane to antiaircraft fire over Japan.

The aircraft carrier retired from the vicinity of Honshu on 18 February, fueled the next day, and then steamed toward Iwo Jima to provide close support. She continued that duty from 20 to 22 February before retiring for a fueling rendezvous on the 23rd. The following day, she and her sister carriers set a course back toward Japan. On the 25th, her air group participated in another series of attacks on the Tokyo region of Japan. Retiring on the 26th, &quot;Bennington&quot; launched aircraft against airfields on Okinawa in the Ryukyu Islands on 1 March. TF 58 headed back to Ulithi on the 3rd and reentered that anchorage the following day for eight days of rest and relaxation.

====Okinawa campaign====
On 14 March, she returned to sea. After several days of training exercises, &quot;Bennington&quot; and the other carriers of TF 58 steamed toward Kyushu, southernmost of the major Japanese home islands, to hit airfields and naval bases there in preparation for the projected invasion of Okinawa. Those attacks went forward on 18 March; and, the following day, &quot;Bennington&quot; aircraft struck the Kure Naval Arsenal and the area of Hiroshima. On the 20th, the aircraft of &quot;Bennington&quot;″s Carrier Air Group 82 (CVG-82) again attacked airfields on Kyushu. That same day, &quot;Bennington&quot; and the other units of TF 58 began their retirement from Japanese waters and toward Okinawa to begin direct support for the landings. On 23 March, she began launching raids against Okinawa and the surrounding islands, concentrating primarily on Kerama Retto, a small group of islands located due west of the southern portion of Okinawa and which constituted the first objective of the invading force. That small group of islands, needed as a fleet anchorage and forward repair base, fell late the following day, and the fast carriers shifted their attention to softening up the main objective.

That phase of the operation lasted until early on the morning of the initial landings on 1 April. After the assault force went ashore, &quot;Bennington&quot; and the other fast carriers began dividing their time between strikes on Okinawa and the surrounding islands in direct support of the occupying troops and raids on the Japanese home islands, primarily Kyushu, in distant support of the operation. On 7 April, &quot;Bennington&quot; aircraft helped stifle the last major action of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The battleship , escorted by light cruiser and eight destroyers, came out of Japan in a desperate attempt to break up the landings at Okinawa. That force, lacking any air cover, was spotted on the 6th by American submarines; and, on the 7th, by American patrol planes. When TF 58 attack groups found the force on the 7th, &quot;Yamato&quot;, &quot;Yahagi&quot;, and four of the destroyers were sunk. The four destroyers that escaped also suffered damage but managed to reach the Sasebo Naval Arsenal. &quot;Bennington&quot; aviators claimed at least two torpedo hits on the battleship at the cost of a single plane from her air group.

The aircraft carrier continued to give support to the Okinawa operation, to provide combat air patrol to intercept enemy air raids, and to attack the airfields that were the points of origin for those raids. On 28 April, &quot;Bennington&quot; and the rest of TG 58.1 left the vicinity of Okinawa for rest and relaxation at Ulithi. She remained at the fleet anchorage from 30 April to 9 May. On the latter day, she stood out of Ulithi and, after exercises in the area, headed back to Okinawa on the 10th. The aircraft carrier resumed support duty for the Okinawa campaign on 12 May. Again, she divided her time between direct support for the troops fighting on the island and sweeps against the Kyushu airfields. Early in June, &quot;Bennington&quot; suffered a damaged flight deck when TF 38 (on 27 May the fleet, task forces, and task groups changed designation) steamed through Typhoon Connie. On 9 June, she set a course for Leyte Gulf and repairs. The ship arrived at her destination on the 11th and underwent repairs until the 27th. She cleared the base at San Pedro Bay (Philippines) on 1 July in company with the rest of TF 38.

====End of the war====
For the remainder of the war, she and the other fast carriers concentrated exclusively upon the Japanese home islands and surrounding waters. Her planes ranged the length of the island chain from Hokkaido in the north to Kyushu in the south, making frequent attacks on Honshu. Targets included industrial complexes, military and naval installations, and shipping. She was still conducting air strikes off Honshu on 15 August when news broke of the Japanese capitulation.

After hostilities ended, &quot;Bennington&quot; continued operations in the Japanese home islands in support of occupation forces. Her aviators conducted routine patrols as well as searches for camps containing Allied prisoners of war. That duty lasted until 10 September at which time she entered Tokyo Bay. The aircraft carrier remained in the Far East until mid-October when she set course back to the United States. Along the way, she stopped at Saipan, where she disembarked her air group, and at Pearl Harbor before entering San Francisco Bay on 7 November. She remained there until the first week in January 1946 when she returned to sea, bound for Hawaii transporting a load of planes and a draft of men. After conducting some training operations in the Hawaiian Islands, the carrier headed back to San Francisco where she arrived on 30 March. Early in April, the warship set out on a voyage to the east coast with CVG-19 embarked. She transited the Panama Canal at mid-month and arrived at Norfolk Naval Base, Virginia, on 22 April. She remained there until 8 November at which time she was decommissioned and berthed with the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

===Cold War===
&quot;Bennington&quot; remained in reserve for almost four years. On 29 October 1950, she moved to the New York Naval Shipyard to receive her SCB-27A modernization. Over the next two years, she underwent a transformation that increased her displacement, length, and beam. Her flight deck was strengthened and widened to accommodate jet aircraft, her island was replaced. She also received many modifications to other equipment, such as catapults and elevators, to accomplish the same purpose. In October 1952, while completing those alterations, she was re-designated an attack aircraft carrier (CVA-20). On 13 November, Captain David. B. Young took command of &quot;Bennington&quot; in a ceremony attended by more than 1,400, including the Secretary of the Navy Dan A. Kimball and Rear Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter. Marine Air Group 14, under the command of Colonel W.R. Campbell, USMC reported for duty on &quot;Bennington&quot; on 13 February 1953, and &quot;Bennington&quot; set off for the waters off Florida to conduct carrier qualifications. The first arrested landing was made on &quot;Bennington&quot; since her recommissioning by Lieutenant Colonel T.W. Furlow in his AD Skyraider. Furlow was the commanding officer of Marine Attack Squadron 211. The first jet aircraft to land on &quot;Bennington&quot; occurred on 18 February by Major Carl E. Schmitt in a F9F-5 Cougar. When the qualifications were over, &quot;Bennington&quot; headed for Guantanamo Bay Naval Base where she underwent 11 weeks of shakedown training with CVG-7 aboard.

During the training cruise, an explosion occurred in her number 1 fireroom on 27 April. 11 men were killed. She put into Guantánamo Bay on the 29th, completed repairs in a week, and returned to sea to continue her shakedown training. On 7 May, she concluded training operations and set a course back to New York. After a stop at Norfolk to disembark her air group, the carrier reentered the New York Naval Shipyard on 25 May to begin post-shakedown availability. That summer, she began normal operations with the United States Atlantic Fleet out of her home port, Naval Air Station Quonset Point, Rhode Island. That duty lasted until mid-September at which time she put to sea to participate in a large-scale NATO exercise, &quot;Operation Mariner&quot;. That operation ended on 4 October, and &quot;Bennington&quot; steamed through the Strait of Gibraltar to begin her first deployment with the United States Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, still with CVG-7 on board. That assignment lasted until 16 February 1954 when she embarked upon her homeward voyage. &quot;Bennington&quot; arrived at Quonset Point on the 21st to disembark her air group. On 1 March, she moved to New York for a shipyard availability and a post-deployment standdown period. Early in April, she returned to sea to conduct carrier qualifications off Mayport, Florida. She completed that mission and returned to Quonset Point on the 29th. Late in May, she moved south to Norfolk where she embarked Air Task Group 181 (ATG-181) on 22 May and put to sea for carrier qualifications in the Narragansett Bay area.

====1954 catapult explosion and fire====

At 0600 on 26 May, &quot;Bennington&quot; began launching aircraft for the qualifications. Ten minutes later, white &quot;smoke&quot; emanating from Hangar Bay 1 caused Captain William F. Raborn to issue two general fire alarms and within seconds a series of explosions rocked the ship when the port side catapult accumulator burst and released vaporized lubricating oil which was detonated by some unknown heat source. Though severely damaged internally, the warship managed to launch the entire air group and send it into Quonset Point, Rhode Island. She also maintained way on and headed back to Quonset Point while damage control, fire, and rescue parties worked feverishly to control fires, to rescue the injured, and to recover the dead. The most severely injured men were carried to Quonset Point in a helicopter lift, and &quot;Bennington&quot; dropped the remainder off there before heading to New York for extensive repairs. The explosion cost her 103 officers and men dead and over 200 others injured, most of them severely burned, the second highest casualty count in the post-war peacetime U.S. Navy. A memorial to the sailors who died in the explosion was erected in 2004 at Fort Adams State Park in Newport, Rhode Island.

A court of inquiry into the explosion chaired by Quonset Point Commander Fleet Air John Hoskins determined that hazards related to hydraulic catapults were previously known and had not yet &quot;led to serious consequences.&quot; The inquiry&#x27;s conclusions eventually led to the Navy&#x27;s abandoning hydro-pneumatic catapults in favor of steam-driven launch systems.

&quot;Bennington&quot; arrived in the New York Naval Shipyard for extensive repairs on 12 June. In addition to repairing the damaged area, the shipyard made major modifications originally scheduled for a later date. She received the SCB-125 modernization. The two most notable changes were the addition of an enclosed hurricane bow to lessen the potential for damage in heavy weather and of an angled flight deck to improve the efficiency of air operations. She completed repairs and alterations by 11 March 1955. On 22 April 1955, the Secretary of the Navy came aboard and presented medals and letters of commendation to 178 of her crew in recognition of their actions on 26 May 1954. As of 1 August 1955, she was part of Carrier Division 2, along with . The carrier returned to sea on 25 April to conduct carrier qualifications off Naval Station Mayport and post-overhaul shakedown training out of Guantánamo Bay. For the next four months, she conducted normal operations along the east coast and in the West Indies with ATG-201 aboard. On 8 September, the carrier embarked upon a voyage to a new home port and a new fleet. Steaming around Cape Horn, she arrived Naval Base San Diego, California, on 20 October. There, the warship joined the United States Pacific Fleet.

====1955–1964====

Over the next nine years, the period preceding the United States&#x27; full entrance into the conflict in Vietnam, &quot;Bennington&quot; divided her time between deployments to the United States Seventh Fleet in Far Eastern waters and normal evolutions along the California coast. During that time, she made five deployments to the Western Pacific. The first two, made during the winter of 1955 and 1956 and the winter of 1957 and 1958, proved to be of routine nature, combining training evolutions and goodwill visits to various Asian ports. ATG-201 was embarked for the first cruise, ATG-181 for the second.

On 7 May 1957, while docked in Sydney for Coral Sea Day celebrations, ten University of Sydney students dressed as pirates boarded the aircraft carrier in the early morning hours undetected. While some began soliciting donations from the Navy crew for a local charity, others entered the bridge. The public address system was turned on. &quot;Now hear this!&quot; announced Paul Lennon, a medical student. &quot;The USS &quot;Bennington&quot; has been captured by Sydney University pirates!&quot; Alarms for general quarters, atomic and chemical attacks were sounded, rousing the crew from their bunks. Marines escorted the students off the ship. No charges were filed.

The third deployment of the period, from August 1958 to January 1959 with ATG-4 aboard, came as an emergency assignment occasioned by Chinese threat to the Taiwanese offshore islands, Quemoy and Matsu Islands. The carrier&#x27;s service during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis earned her the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. Following her return to normal west coast duty in January 1959, the U.S. Navy decided to use the carrier exclusively for antisubmarine warfare. On 30 June 1959, she became an antisubmarine warfare support aircraft carrier (CVS-20). Carrier Anti-Submarine Air Group 59 (CVSG-59) was assigned to &quot;Bennington&quot; until her decommissioning. She was used in the movie, &quot;The Wackiest Ship in The Army,&quot; During her fourth tour of duty in the Far East, carried out between October 1960 and May 1961, the Laotian crisis erupted. Again, she earned the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. The final deployment of that period was characterized by a return to more normal duty, training and port calls. &quot;Bennington&quot; was dispatched to Eureka, in Humboldt County, California, during the Christmas flood of 1964 to provide disaster relief from severe flooding with water levels that exceeded thirty feet. The &quot;Bennington&quot; remained offshore in heavy seas and the twenty Marine helicopters she carried were invaluable in providing assistance and supplies to the stricken residents.

====Vietnam War and later career====

&quot;Bennington&quot;&#x27;s final seven years of active service, which included four more assignments with the 7th Fleet, coincided with the period of direct involvement of United States armed forces in the Vietnam War. The first deployment of this phase of her career started peacefully enough early in 1964, but the Tonkin Gulf incident in August extended her Far Eastern tour and brought duty in Vietnamese waters in October and November. Her next 7th Fleet tour of duty, during the summer and fall of 1965, brought more duty off the coast of Vietnam, but the service was not nearly so extensive as the she would perform during her final two deployments.

On 18 May 1966, while cruising off of San Diego, California, &quot;Bennington&quot; hosted the experimental LTV XC-142 aircraft as it executed 44 short takeoffs and landings and six vertical takeoffs and landings, the ship steaming at various speeds to generate different velocities of wind-over-the-deck. She was the prime recovery vessel for the unmanned Apollo 4 mission and on 9 November 1967 recovered the spacecraft which had splashed down from the ship. 

On 4 November 1966, &quot;Bennington&quot; embarked upon her next to last 7th Fleet assignment. Throughout that tour of duty, she served with the larger carriers on Yankee Station in the Gulf of Tonkin. In addition to providing antisubmarine protection to Task Force 77, she also had the responsibility for tracking and identifying all ships operating in the vicinity of the task force and for providing search and rescue services for downed aviators. The deployment ended on 21 April, and &quot;Bennington&quot; headed for Australia to participate in the celebration commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Allied victory in the Battle of the Coral Sea. The carrier departed Sydney, Australia, on 8 May and, after a stop at Pearl Harbor on the 18th, arrived in San Diego on 23 May 1967.

After almost a year of normal operations along the west coast, she stood out of Long Beach, California, for the final deployment on 30 April 1968. She made a stop at Pearl Harbor from 15 to 20 May and arrived in United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka on 29 May. Her last deployment brought more of the same duty that she had seen on the previous one, antisubmarine protection for TF 77, ship identification work, and search and rescue services. She concluded that tour of duty on 28 October when she departed Yokosuka to return to the United States. &quot;Bennington&quot; arrived in Long Beach on 9 November and, on the 14th, entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for a five-month yard overhaul. The aircraft carrier resumed active service on 30 April 1969 and conducted normal operations along the California coast for the remainder of the year and into January 1970. On 15 January 1970, &quot;Bennington&quot; was placed out of commission with the Pacific Reserve Fleet at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 September 1989. The carrier was finally sold for scrap on 12 January 1994, being subsequently towed across the Pacific for scrapping in India.

Bostwick was a member of First National Nothing, who released one album, 1970&#x27;s &quot;If You Sit Real Still and Hold My Hand, You Will Hear Absolutely Nothing.&quot; They are described on the album as &quot;A rock-theater commune made up of musicians, actors, dancers, singers, designers, writers, composers, and friends that started a long, long time ago as a lost tribe in California and has ended up as a theatrical performing company in New York City.&quot;

In 1970, Bostwick was a member of a pop band called The Klowns, assembled and promoted by Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, whose members performed wearing stylized clown makeup and costumes. Their sole album, released in 1970, was produced by Jeff Barry, and generated a minor &quot;Billboard&quot; hit single, &quot;Lady Love.&quot;

<doc id="208551" wikidata="Q446605" url="?curid=208551" title="Bernard Cornwell">
<text>Bernard Cornwell (born 23 February 1944) is an English author of historical novels and a history of the Waterloo Campaign. He is best known for his long-running series of novels about Napoleonic Wars rifleman Richard Sharpe. He has also written &quot;The Saxon Stories&quot;, a series of thirteen novels about the unification of England.

He has written historical novels primarily based on English history, in five series, and one series of contemporary thriller novels. A feature of his historical novels is an end note on how they match or differ from history, and what one might see at the modern sites of the events described. He wrote a nonfiction book on the battle of Waterloo, in addition to the fictional story of the famous battle in the Sharpe series. Three of the historical novel series have been adapted for television: the &quot;Sharpe&quot; television series by ITV, &quot;The Last Kingdom&quot; by BBC and &quot;The Winter King&quot; for MGM+. He lives in the US with his wife, alternating between Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and Charleston, South Carolina.

==Biography==
Cornwell was born in London in 1944. His father was Canadian airman William Oughtred and his mother was Englishwoman Dorothy Cornwell, a member of the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force. He was adopted and brought up in Thundersley, Essex, by the Wiggins family; they were members of the Peculiar People, a strict sect of pacifists who banned frivolity of all kinds, and even medicine up to 1930. Reacting to being raised by Christian Fundamentalists, he grew up rejecting all religions and became an atheist.

After his adoptive father died, he changed his last name by deed poll from Wiggins to Cornwell, his birth mother&#x27;s maiden name. Prior to that, he had used Bernard Cornwell as a pen name. He met his father for the first time when he was 58, after telling a journalist on a book tour, &quot;what I wanted to see in Vancouver was my real father.&quot; There he met his half-siblings, with whom he shares many traits, and learned his genealogy. He believes he is a descendant of Uhtred the Bold, upon whom he partly based the Saxon Stories book series.

Cornwell was sent to Monkton Combe School in Somerset. He read history at University College London between 1963 and 1966 and worked as a teacher after graduating. He attempted to enlist in the British armed services at least three times but was rejected on the grounds of myopia.

Following his work as a teacher, Cornwell joined the BBC&#x27;s Nationwide and was later promoted to head of current affairs at BBC Northern Ireland. He then joined Thames Television as editor of &quot;Thames News&quot;. 

His first marriage ended in divorce in the 1970s. He met his second wife, Judy, in 1978 in Edinburgh while he was working for BBC Northern Ireland; she was a travel agent from the US and the mother of three children from a previous marriage. He relocated to the United States in 1979 after marrying her. He was unable to get a United States Permanent Resident Card (green card), so he started writing novels, as this did not require a work permit. He later became an American citizen.

==Career==
As a child, Cornwell loved the novels of C. S. Forester which chronicled the adventures of fictional British naval officer Horatio Hornblower during the Napoleonic Wars. He was surprised to find that there were no army counterparts, so he wrote such a series himself—further motivated by the need to support himself through writing. As his chief protagonist he created a rifleman involved in most of the major battles of the Peninsular War, taking the character&#x27;s name from rugby player Richard Sharp.

Cornwell originally planned to start the series with the Siege of Badajoz but decided instead to begin with a couple of &quot;warm-up&quot; novels. These were &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Eagle&quot; and &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Gold&quot;, both published in 1981. He went on to tell the story of Badajoz in &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Company&quot; published in 1982. He had a seven-book deal with his publisher.

Cornwell and wife Judy co-wrote a series of novels published under the pseudonym &quot;Susannah Kells&quot;: &quot;A Crowning Mercy&quot; published in 1983, &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; in 1984, and &quot;Coat of Arms&quot; (aka &quot;The Aristocrats&quot;) in 1986. Cornwell&#x27;s strict Protestant upbringing forms the background of &quot;A Crowning Mercy&quot;, which takes place during the English Civil War. He also published &quot;Redcoat&quot; in 1987, an American Revolutionary War novel set in Philadelphia during its 1777 occupation by the British.

Cornwell was approached by a production company interested in making television adaptations of the first eight books of his Sharpe series. They asked him to write a background novel to give them a starting point to the series and also requested that the story featured a substantial role for Spanish characters in order to secure co-funding from Spain. The result was &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Rifles&quot;, published in 1987 and set in the period of the English retreat at A Coruña. It resulted in a series of Sharpe television films starring Sean Bean.

This was followed by a series of modern thrillers with sailing as a background and common themes: &quot;Wildtrack&quot; published in 1988, &quot;Sea Lord&quot; (or &quot;Killer&#x27;s Wake&quot;) in 1989, &quot;Crackdown&quot; in 1990, &quot;Stormchild&quot; in 1991, and the political thriller &quot;Scoundrel&quot; in 1992.

Cornwell wrote two books a year for a long time, slowing to one per year in his sixties. His idea of historical fiction is of presenting a &quot;big story&quot; in historical events and a &quot;little story&quot; in fictional plot. Patrick O&#x27;Brian, who wrote the Aubrey-Maturin series of historical adventures set in the Napoleonic era, said that there was &quot;too much plot, not enough lifestyle&quot; in the novels of Cornwell and C. S. Forester. Cornwell took that as a compliment and an accurate appraisal of the difference between the style of O&#x27;Brian and his own, while appreciating the association with Forester.

With the success of the Sharpe series, Cornwell began to write about other periods and historical events in English and American history, both in series and in single novels. &quot;Azincourt&quot; was released in the UK in October 2008. The protagonist is an archer who participates in the Battle of Agincourt, a devastating defeat suffered by the French during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. In 2004, he released &quot;The Last Kingdom&quot;, beginning the Saxon Stories centered on protagonist Uhtred of Bebbanburg and telling how the nation of England began forming under King Alfred the Great. He realised that few in England knew how England began, unlike Americans who have a clear date for their nation&#x27;s beginning—so this became his &quot;big story&quot;. His own ancestral roots gave him the &quot;little story&quot; in the protagonist Uhtred.

&quot;The Fort&quot;, published in 2010, is another of Cornwell&#x27;s stand-alone novels. It tells of the Penobscot Expedition of 1779 during the American Revolutionary War. 

Bernard Cornwell has been extremely successful in his writing career, selling 30 million books by 2015 throughout the various series and individual novels, and he continues to write new novels.

==Honours==

Cornwell was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2006 Birthday Honours for services to literature and television production.

==Novel series==

===Sharpe stories===

Cornwell&#x27;s first series of historical novels features the adventures of Richard Sharpe, an English soldier during the Napoleonic Wars, in particular the Peninsular Wars once Arthur Wellesley was sent to lead the campaign against Napoleon&#x27;s forces on the Iberian Peninsula. The first 11 books of the Sharpe series began with &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Rifles&quot; and ended with &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Waterloo&quot;, published in the US as &quot;Waterloo&quot;. These detail Sharpe&#x27;s adventures in various Peninsular War campaigns over the course of seven years. Subsequently, Cornwell wrote &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Tiger&quot;, &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Triumph&quot;, &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Fortress&quot;, &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Trafalgar&quot;, and &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Prey&quot;, depicting Sharpe&#x27;s earlier adventures under Wellington&#x27;s command in India, including his hard-won promotion to the officer corps, his return to Britain, and his arrival in the 95th Rifles; he also wrote the sequel &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Devil&quot;, set six years after the end of the wars. Since 2003, he has written further &quot;missing adventures&quot; set during the Peninsular War era, based on major battles of that long campaign, for a total of 22 novels in this series. The Sharpe Appreciation Society has also published three short stories by Cornwell: &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Skirmish&quot;, &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Christmas&quot; and &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Ransom&quot;.

Cornwell mentions in notes at the end of the Sharpe series that he was initially dubious about the casting of Sean Bean for the television adaptations, but that the doubts did not last and he was subsequently so delighted that he dedicated &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Battle&quot; to him. He has admitted that he subtly changed the writing of the character to align with Bean&#x27;s portrayal as now he &quot;could not imagine Sharpe as anyone else&quot;. One of Cornwell&#x27;s initial misgivings about Bean was that he did not physically resemble the black-haired Sharpe whom he described in the early books, but he thought that Bean understood and acted the part perfectly, and he subsequently refrained from mentioning Sharpe&#x27;s hair colour.

===Warlord Chronicles===

A trilogy depicting Arthurian Britain. The series posits that post-Roman Britain was a difficult time for the native Britons, being threatened by invasion from the Anglo-Saxons in the East and raids from the Irish in the West. At the same time, they suffered internal power struggles between their petty kingdoms and friction between the old Druidic religion and newly arrived Christianity. The author has often said that these are his own favourite stories; &quot;I have to confess that of all the books I have written these three are my favourites.&quot;

===Grail Quest novels===

This series deals with a mid-14th century search for the Holy Grail during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Englishman Thomas of Hookton becomes drawn into the quest by a mysterious man called &quot;The Harlequin&quot;, who murders Thomas&#x27;s father in his search for the Grail. Cornwell was planning at one point to write more books about Thomas of Hookton and said that, shortly after finishing &quot;Heretic&quot;, the third novel in the series, he had &quot;started another Thomas of Hookton book, then stopped it—mainly because I felt that his story ended in &quot;Heretic&quot; and I was just trying to get too much from him. Which doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t pick the idea up again sometime in the future.&quot; He returned to the character in &quot;1356&quot;, published in 2012.

===Saxon Stories/The Last Kingdom===

The series focuses on the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex. The idea for the series took shape in his mind after meeting his real father in Canada in his fifties, learning his own ancestry back to that era, to the real-life Uhtred of Bebbanburg, who became Uhtred, the protagonist of the series. Cornwell realised that most English people are unaware of how England came to be, rather than say, Dane-land, in that era of multiple peoples on the island of Great Britain. Uhtred reluctantly helps Alfred the Great, a man he respects but dislikes, further his ambition of uniting all English speakers into a single kingdom. The series continues after the death of Alfred, with his heirs striving to achieve his dream. The first novel was published in 2004. In 2020, the 13th and final book was published.

&quot;The Last Kingdom&quot; and &quot;The Pale Horseman&quot; were the basis for the first series of the television series, &quot;The Last Kingdom&quot;, while &quot;The Lords of the North&quot; and &quot;Sword Song&quot; were the basis for the second series. A third series, based on &quot;The Burning Land&quot; and &quot;Death of Kings&quot;, was released in November 2018, and a fourth series was released in April 2020. A fifth series was released on March 9 2022.

===Starbuck Chronicles===

Four novels set during the American Civil War follow the adventures of Boston-born Nathaniel Starbuck during his service in the Confederate Army. The series is notable for an appearance by Richard Sharpe&#x27;s son as a supporting character.

===Thriller series===
Cornwell&#x27;s thriller series are modern mysteries, all with sailing themes. He is a traditional sailor and enjoys sailing his Cornish Crabber christened &quot;Royalist&quot;. According to Cornwell&#x27;s website, there may be no additions to the series: &quot;I enjoyed writing the thrillers, but suspect I am happier writing historical novels. I&#x27;m always delighted when people want more of the sailing books, but I&#x27;m not planning on writing any more, at least not now – but who knows? Perhaps when I retire&quot;.

==Nonfiction==
In addition to his many novels, including a fictional account (&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Waterloo&quot;) of the battle of Waterloo, Cornwell published a nonfiction book, &quot;&quot;, released in September 2014, in time for the 200th anniversary of that battle.

<doc id="208556" wikidata="Q30587581" url="?curid=208556" title="Private member's bill">
<text>A private member&#x27;s bill is a bill (proposed law) introduced into a legislature by a legislator who is not acting on behalf of the executive branch. The designation &quot;private member&#x27;s bill&quot; is used in most Westminster system jurisdictions, in which a &quot;private member&quot; is any member of parliament (MP) who is not a member of the cabinet (executive). Other labels may be used for the concept in other parliamentary systems; for example, the label member&#x27;s bill is used in the Scottish Parliament and the New Zealand Parliament, the term private senator&#x27;s bill is used in the Australian Senate, and the term public bill is used in the Senate of Canada. In legislatures where the executive does not have the right of initiative, such as the United States Congress, the concept does not arise since bills are always introduced by legislators (or sometimes by popular initiative).

In the Westminster system, most bills are &quot;government bills&quot; introduced by the executive, with private members&#x27; bills the exception; however, some time is set aside in the schedule for reading such bills. They may be introduced by non-ministerial MPs from government-supporting parties (backbenchers), by members of opposition parties (frontbencher or backbencher), or by independents or crossbenchers. The Israeli Knesset has a long history of enacting private members&#x27; bills: a slight majority of the laws passed by it originated as private members&#x27; bills, and thousands more are introduced without being passed. In contrast, the Oireachtas (parliament) of the Republic of Ireland rarely passes private members&#x27; bills, with the overwhelming number of bills being passed being introduced by members of the cabinet.

A private member&#x27;s bill is not to be confused with a private bill, which is a bill that only affects an individual citizen or group.

==Private member&#x27;s bill by region==

===Australia===

In Australia, a draft bill is prepared by Parliamentary Counsel, acting under instructions from the private member. After community consultation, the member introduces the bill into the Parliament.

Only 30 private members&#x27; bills or private senators&#x27; bills introduced into the Australian Parliament since 1901 have been passed into law. Of these, thirteen have been initiated by senators, ten by members and seven by the Speaker and Senate President. A larger number have passed one house but not the other. An even larger number did not pass the house in which they were introduced and thus lapsed.

Among the most notable of the successful bills was the Commonwealth Electoral Bill 1924, which introduced compulsory voting for federal elections. This was introduced by Senator for Tasmania Herbert Payne of the Nationalist Party on 16 July 1924, passed by the Senate on 23 July, passed by the House of Representatives on 24 July – both times with little debate – and given royal assent on 31 July. Despite much public debate ever since on the issue of compulsory voting, the legislation has never been repealed.

Another very notable private member&#x27;s bill was the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996, which deprived the Northern Territory, Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island legislatures of the power to make laws permitting euthanasia. This was introduced by Kevin Andrews, Member for Menzies, after the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly had passed such a law, the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995. Although Andrews was a member of the Liberal Party, members and senators were allowed a conscience vote on the issue, and each side of the debate was supported by members and senators from all political parties.

A private member&#x27;s bill, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017, legalised same-sex marriage throughout Australia on 9 December 2017. It was introduced by Dean Smith, Senator for Western Australia.

Notable also was the private member&#x27;s bill introduced by Alan Corbett in the New South Wales Legislative Council to amend the Crimes Act of 1900. The first successfully enacted (or indeed introduced) bill in over 100 years to address the protection of children from abuse and excessive physical chastisement. It received very wide support from New South Wales organisations related to child health and welfare and was backed by several prominent members of the medical profession, particularly in the paediatric field, notably John Yu, CEO of Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, Sydney (who had been honoured by the Australian Government with the prestigious Australian of the Year award in 1996). Its initial aims were to limit physical chastisement by banning the use of implements (belts, sticks, hairbrushes, etc.), ban the use of force above the shoulders (thus preventing neck, head, brain and facial injuries), and require that any physical force applied leave only trivial and short-lived signs such as redness (that is, no bruising, swelling, welts, cuts, grazes, internal injuries, emotional trauma, etc.); with the exception of the clause banning the use of implements (which was dropped to gain essential support from the state Labor Government for the bill), it was passed intact and became law in 2001.

===Canada===
In Canada, a private member&#x27;s bill () is a bill introduced in the House of Commons by a member of parliament who is neither a cabinet minister nor a parliamentary secretary. A private member&#x27;s bill follows the same legislative process as a government bill, but the time allocated for its consideration is restricted. Private members&#x27; bills may be considered only during one of the daily Private Members&#x27; Hours. Under rules established in 1986, 20 items of private members&#x27; business are selected at random to receive priority in debate. Six of these items are chosen by a committee to be votable and must come to a vote in the House. Prior to the 1986 rules, private members&#x27; bills and motions could be &quot;talked out&quot;, meaning that all the time allocated to private members&#x27; bills could be used up introducing or debating bills without them ever being voted on, as each bill must be voted on after the second hour of debate. (The ramifications of the 1986 rules were discussed in the &quot;Canadian Parliamentary Review&quot;, 1988, Vol 11, No. 3.) Even under the new rules, very few private members&#x27; bills become law, but passage is more likely in minority government situations. The vast majority of private members&#x27; bills that actually do become law are for the purpose of changing the name of the riding represented by the MP introducing the bill.

When an election is called, all bills that have not been passed die on the order paper (that is, they are removed from the agenda of Parliament, and must be re-introduced in the new session of Parliament after an election). In the House of Commons (but not in the Senate), private members&#x27; bills remain on the order paper when Parliament is prorogued.

Notable private members bills have been the following:

====Passed====
In the 98 years from 4 May 1910 to 7 September 2008, 229 private members&#x27; bills passed.

=====Before the 1986 rules=====
* One of the bills passed under the old (pre-1986) rules was a 1964 private member&#x27;s bill to rename &quot;Trans-Canada Airlines&quot; to &quot;Air Canada&quot;, introduced by then-rookie MP Jean Chrétien. Chrétien got his bill voted on by convincing the other MPs scheduled to speak during Private Member&#x27;s Hour to skip their speech and instead request an immediate vote on the bill.

=====After the 1986 rules=====
The new rules took effect in 1986. In the 24 years between 5 November 1984 and 7 September 2008, 81 private members&#x27; bills passed. Passage was (and is) more likely during the periods of minority governments in Canada. The ramifications of the 1986 rules and new probability of success of private members bills were discussed in the &quot;Canadian Parliamentary Review&quot;, 1988, Vol 11, No. 3.
* NDP MP Lynn McDonald succeeded in getting her private member&#x27;s bill, the &quot;Non-smokers&#x27; Health Act&quot; (aka Bill C-204), passed in 1986, (given royal assent on 28 June 1988) restricting smoking in federally regulated workplaces and on airplanes, trains and ships. The bill was passed in a free vote of the House of Commons despite being voted against by all members of the federal cabinet, including the Minister of Health.

===Hong Kong===
Article 74 of the Hong Kong Basic Law prohibits private members&#x27; bills that relate to public expenditure, political structure or the operation of the Government. Private members&#x27; bills that involve government policies must be agreed by the Chief Executive. Whether the bill involves such issues are to be determined by the Legislative Council President. For private members&#x27; bills proposed for the particular interest or benefit of any individual, association or body corporate, a fee of HK$33,500 for amendment bills, and HK$67,000 for principal bills must also be paid to the Director of Accounting Services.

===India===
Of the 300 or so private members&#x27; bills introduced in the 14th Lok Sabha, barely 4% were discussed; 96% lapsed without even a single debate in the House. To date, Parliament has passed a total of 14 private members&#x27; bills.

Following are the 14 Private Members&#x27; Bills which were passed:-

#The Muslim Wakfs Bill introduced by Syed Md. Ahmed Kasmi in Lok Sabha
#The Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill introduced by Raghunath Singh in Lok Sabha
#The Indian Registration (Amendment) Bill introduced by SC Samanta in Lok Sabha

Five of these were passed in 1956 alone and after 47 years of passing the last bill, the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Bill, 1968 that became an Act on 9 August 1970; Rajya Sabha has passed the Rights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2014 on April 24, 2015, which was introduced in the lower house, Lok Sabha on 26 February 2016.

===Israel===
In Israel, a private member&#x27;s bill () is a bill introduced in the Knesset by an MK who is neither a cabinet minister nor a deputy minister. The number of private members&#x27; bills an individual MK can submit is restricted, and their introduction requires approval by the Knesset Presidium (composed of the Speaker of the Knesset and their deputies), who are allowed to reject bills which are racist in their essence or reject the Jewish character of the state.

Unlike government bills, which can be withdrawn at any point before their third reading, a private member&#x27;s bill cannot be withdrawn after its committee stage, which occurs between first and second readings. In addition, private members&#x27; bills must undergo a preliminary reading, while government bills go to first reading directly when they are introduced.

Compared to other Westminster system parliaments, the number of private members&#x27; bills introduced in the Knesset is very large: Between 2000 and 2016, the number of private members&#x27; bills introduced before the Knesset was 22,949, a world record.

However, this is a relatively recent phenomenon – while only 6% of laws passed by the Third Knesset where introduced as private members&#x27; bills, the equivalent share for the Fifteenth Knesset is 53%, a slight majority.

===Malaysia===
As of September 2021, no private member&#x27;s bill was passed in the Malaysian parliament.

===New Zealand===

In New Zealand, a member&#x27;s bill (often misattributed as private member&#x27;s bill) is one that is introduced by a member of Parliament who is not a minister. There can be a maximum of eight members&#x27; bills on the Order Paper awaiting their first reading at any one time. When a slot opens up, a ballot is held to select a new members&#x27; bill for introduction; each MP can submit only one member&#x27;s bill at a time to the ballot. Every second Wednesday is reserved for debating members&#x27; bills, although this rule is overridden when certain government business is before the House, such as the Budget. Even when a Wednesday is devoted to members&#x27; bills, any private or local bills on the Order Paper are considered first.

The ballot to select new members&#x27; bills is conducted by drawing numbered counters out of a biscuit tin, purchased in the 1980s from now-defunct department store chain DEKA. As a result, the member&#x27;s bill process is nicknamed &quot;biscuit tin democracy&quot;.

Starting with the 53rd Parliament (2020–23), a member&#x27;s bill can be introduced directly if it has the support of at least 61 non-executive members of Parliament. This allows members&#x27; bills with broad support to avoid the ballot process, while excluding executive members prevents the member&#x27;s bill process being an alternative way of progressing Government business.

Notable legislation passed as a result of a member&#x27;s bill includes:
*Adult Adoption Information Act 1985 – allowed adult adoptees to access information about their birth parents
*Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986 – decriminalised homosexual acts between men
*Prostitution Reform Act 2003 – decriminalised prostitution
*Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007 – removed &quot;reasonable force&quot; legal defence for assault of children by parents
*Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013 – legalised same-sex marriage
*End of Life Choice Act 2019 – provided for a binding referendum to give people with a terminal illness the option of requesting assisted dying

===Norway===
In the Parliament of Norway, any member may submit a private member&#x27;s bill, called a representative&#x27;s bill (). The other method of initiating legislation is by a &quot;Proposition to the &quot;Storting&quot;&quot; from the Government.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom House of Commons, there are several routes to introducing private members&#x27; bills. In each session, twenty backbench MPs are selected by ballot to introduce a bill. These bills are given priority for debate and generally offer the best chance of success. Additional bills may be introduced via the Ten Minute Rule, although this is usually used just to raise an issue rather than legislate on it, or through presentation without debate under Standing Order 57. Neither Ten Minute Rule or presentation bills are likely to get time to be debated, so only non-controversial bills have any chance of success. Private members&#x27; bills from the Lords may also be adopted by an MP to complete their journey through Parliament.

Private members&#x27; bills can sometimes become the cause for much anxiety and shenanigans, as outside individuals or organisations seek to influence members who have been selected in the ballot.

There are two principal routes for influencing UK law:
* Lobbying a government department or minister.
* Lobbying a member of parliament who has a private member&#x27;s bill coming up.

Only a small proportion of private members&#x27; bills are enacted. This is generally because of lack of time – a controversial private member&#x27;s bill can be &quot;talked out&quot;. In some cases, measures that a government does not want to take responsibility for may be introduced by backbenchers, with the government secretly or openly backing the measure and ensuring its passage. They are sometimes known as &quot;handouts&quot; or &quot;whips&#x27; bills&quot;. The Abortion Act 1967 was enacted in the United Kingdom through this means: with the Bill itself being introduced by a Liberal Party Member of Parliament, David Steel; through the support from Labour Home Secretary Roy Jenkins the Bill was given enough government time to allow a full debate.

Other private members&#x27; bills to have been enacted include the Adoption Act 1964, the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965, the Charter Trustees Act 1985, the Law Reform (Year and a Day Rule) Act 1996, the Knives Act 1997, the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997, the Mental Health (Discrimination) Act 2003 the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003, the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004, the Sustainable Communities Act 2007.

====House of Commons procedure====

In principle, private members&#x27; bills follow much the same parliamentary stages as any other bill. In practice, the procedural barriers to passage are much greater.

Time is allocated for private members&#x27; bills on 13 Fridays a year in the House of Commons. Five hours of time are available each day, and several private members&#x27; bills are scheduled for each session.

Unlike Government bills, debates are not timetabled and there is no guarantee that the debate will finish within the time available. MPs opposed to a private member&#x27;s bill, including Government ministers and whips, will routinely attempt to talk out the bill, stopping further progress by preventing a vote. The bill&#x27;s proponent can force a vote only with the support of at least a hundred members (and a majority of those voting). As many MPs return to their constituencies on Thursday night, this has the practical effect of blocking all private members&#x27; bills without solid support.

It is quite possible for the first bill to take up all five hours, preventing any other bill on the agenda from being debated. Any bill not debated may receive second reading without debate at the end of the session, but a single shout of &quot;object!&quot; will delay consideration to a future date; Government and opposition whips routinely block contentious private members&#x27; bills in this way. Another date for second reading will also be set for bills which have been talked out. This is a formality; the bill will be put to the bottom of the order paper, will likely be objected to on each future occasion and has no practical chance of success.

Even if second reading is passed, a bill is likely to need the support of the government to become law. The bill will be referred to public bill committee, which may make amendments. The amended version of the bill will then return to the Commons. To become law, it must also successfully negotiate report stage and third reading, as well as the House of Lords. Contentious bills are likely to run out of parliamentary time unless the government allocates some; any pending private members&#x27; bills lapse at the end of each parliamentary session.

Private members&#x27; bills may also originate in the House of Lords. To become law, these bills must be adopted by an MP and passed in the same way as a bill originated in the Commons.

<text>Johann David Wyss (; 28 May 1743 – 11 January 1818) was a Swiss author, best remembered for his book &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot; (&quot;Der schweizerische Robinson&quot;) (1812). He was born and died in Bern. It is said that he was inspired by Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, but wanted to write a story from which his own children would learn, as the father in the story taught important lessons to his children. &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot; was first published in German in 1812, then translated into English two years later. The book was edited by his son, Johann Rudolf Wyss, a scholar known for writing the Swiss national anthem, &quot;Rufst du, mein Vaterland&quot;. Another of Wyss&#x27;s sons, Johann Emmanuel Wyss, illustrated the book. Johann David Wyss died in 1818 at the age of 74. He lived longer than his son Johann Rudolf, who would die twelve years later at the age of 48.

Wyss has been described as an author whose style was &quot;firmly Christian and moral in tone&quot;. There are also many underlying tones of Christianity throughout the book, particularly with regard to many of the characters and their moral philosophies.

== Influence ==
Jules Verne reportedly declared that &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot; was one of his favorite books, so much so that he was inspired to write a sequel, &quot;The Castaways of the Flag&quot; (1900), nearly a century after Wyss&#x27;s death.

<doc id="208559" wikidata="Q731591" url="?curid=208559" title="Backbencher">
<text>In Westminster and other parliamentary systems, a backbencher is a member of parliament (MP) or a legislator who occupies no governmental office and is not a frontbench spokesperson in the Opposition, being instead simply a member of the &quot;&quot;.

The term dates from 1855. The term derives from the fact that they sit physically behind the frontbench in the House of Commons. A backbencher may be a new parliamentary member yet to receive a high office, a senior figure dropped from government, someone who for whatever reason is not chosen to sit in the government or an opposition spokesperson (such as a shadow cabinet if one exists), or someone who prefers to be a background influence, not in the spotlight.

In most parliamentary systems, individual backbenchers have little power to affect government policy. However, they play a greater role in the work of the legislature itself; for example, sitting on parliamentary committees, where legislation is considered and parliamentary work is done in more detail than there is time for on the floor of the House. In addition, since backbenchers generally form the vast majority of government MPs – and even their totality in dualistic parliamentary systems, where Ministers cannot serve as MPs simultaneously, collectively they can sometimes exercise considerable power, especially in cases where the policies of the government are unpopular or when a governing party or coalition is internally split. Government backbenchers carry considerable influence when they are in a party with a small majority.

In some legislative assemblies, sitting at the back of the chamber is not necessarily associated with having a minor role. In Switzerland, senior figures sit in the back rows in order to have a better overview and be closer to the doors for discussions outside the plenary. In Germany, the party leaders sit in the front row, but there are no designated places for other senior figures. The term backbenchers (&quot;Hinterbänkler&quot;) therefore refers to largely unknown MPs without much influence, regardless of where they sit. Originally, the importance of the front rows for the leaders had also to do with the fact that acoustics were often unsatisfactory before microphones were introduced. Prominent or iconic political figures can also play a backbench role, as the case of Aung San Suu Kyi illustrates: the leader of Myanmar&#x27;s opposition to military rule was first elected MP in 2012 but proved only marginally involved in legislative business.

The term &quot;backbencher&quot; has also been adopted outside parliamentary systems, such as the United States Congress. While legislative branches in presidential systems do not share the firm front bench/back bench dichotomy of the Westminster system, the term has been used to denote junior legislators or legislators who are not part of party leadership within a legislative body.

==By country==

===United Kingdom===

The most important backbench role is that of a constituency representative; constituents rely heavily on their MPs to represent them in parliament and make sure their concerns are heard, whether or not they voted for the MP representing them. Constituents may email and meet their MPs, raising the issues and concerns they want the government to hear. Backbenchers have an important opportunity to raise their constituents concerns directly to the prime minister in Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions. 

Backbenchers also have an unofficial agenda-setting power, with Opposition Day debates, private member&#x27;s bills, and Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions available to place items on the parliamentary agenda which are awkward for the government. The Wright Committee reforms introduced in the UK provided backbenchers with much more power in committees, giving Parliament greater control of its agenda, and increasing backbench membership in committees vastly.

Additionally, the Commons Backbench Business Committee was created in 2010 with cross-party support. It debates matters unlikely to be debated in government time, with each decision voted upon formally. By the end of 2010 coalition government it had undergone 300 debates, ranging from prisoner voting rights to the Hillsborough disaster. Furthermore, they have influence as discussed above when they are a member of a committee, these committees provide a perfect opportunity for backbenchers to have their voices heard in the legislative process. It usually proves difficult for backbenchers to be involved and have direct input in the legislative process when they are not involved in these activities.

<doc id="208561" wikidata="Q303329" url="?curid=208561" title="Shadow cabinet">
<text>The shadow cabinet or shadow ministry is a feature of the Westminster system of government. It consists of a senior group of opposition spokespeople who, under the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition, form an alternative cabinet to that of the government, and whose members shadow or mirror the positions of each individual member of the Cabinet. Their areas of responsibility, in parallel with the ruling party&#x27;s ministries, may be referred to as a shadow portfolio. Members of a shadow cabinet have no executive power. It is the shadow cabinet&#x27;s responsibility to scrutinise the policies and actions of the government, as well as to offer alternative policies. The shadow cabinet makes up the majority of the Official Opposition frontbench, as part of frontbenchers to the parliament. Smaller opposition parties in Britain and Ireland have Frontbench Teams.

In many countries, a member of the shadow cabinet is referred to as a shadow minister. In the United Kingdom&#x27;s House of Lords and in New Zealand, the term &quot;spokesperson&quot; is used instead of &quot;shadow&quot;. In Canada, the term opposition critic is also used.

==Description and functions==
The shadow ministers&#x27; duties may give them considerable prominence in the party caucus hierarchy especially if it is a high-profile portfolio. Although the salary and benefits paid from the public treasury to shadow ministers remain the same as for a backbencher—they have no executive responsibilities, unlike cabinet ministers—some opposition parties provide an additional stipend in addition to the salary they receive as legislators while many at least reimburse shadow ministers for any additional expenses incurred that are not otherwise eligible for reimbursement out of public funds. Moreover, in most Westminster-style legislative bodies all recognised parliamentary parties are granted a block of public funding to help their elected members carry out their duties, often in addition to the budgets individual legislators receive to pay for constituency offices and other such expenses. There is typically a stipulation that such funds must be used for official parliamentary business; however, within that restriction, parties can usually distribute the funds among their elected lawmakers as they see fit and thereby provide the money needed to staff and support shadow ministries.

Members of a shadow cabinet may not necessarily be appointed to the corresponding Cabinet post if and when their party forms a government, assuming that they retain their seats which by convention is usually considered a prerequisite to serve in the cabinet. However, the consistency with which parties assuming power appoint shadow ministers into the actual roles in government varies widely depending on such things as jurisdiction, the traditions and practices of the party assuming government, the exact circumstances surrounding their assumption of power and even the importance of the cabinet post in question.

As well as being potential future ministers, some shadow ministers have held ministerial posts in the past.

As a mark of discipline, shadow ministers are expected to speak within and not outside their portfolio areas.

==Cultural applications==
In the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, the major opposition party and specifically its shadow cabinet is called &quot;His (or Her) Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition&quot;. The adjective &quot;loyal&quot; is used because, while the role of the opposition is to oppose His Majesty&#x27;s Government, it does not dispute the sovereign&#x27;s right to the throne and therefore the legitimacy of the government. However, in other countries that use the Westminster system, the opposition is known simply as &quot;the parliamentary opposition&quot;.

In most Westminster systems, the leader of the opposition heads the shadow cabinet in person and directly shadows the prime minister, and the title of &quot;shadow prime minister&quot; is generally not used. Non-Westminster systems that have adopted a shadow cabinet system, however, typically designate its head as &quot;shadow prime minister&quot;. Moreover, in these systems, the shadow prime minister is not necessarily coterminous with the leader of the opposition party (for example, in Czechia, ANO 2011 party leader Andrej Babiš designated Karel Havlíček as the party&#x27;s shadow prime minister) and is not necessarily expected to become prime minister if the opposition party assumes power.

Some parliamentary parties, notably the Australian Labor Party, elect all the members of their shadow cabinets in a party room ballot, with the shadow prime minister then allocating portfolios to the shadow ministers. In other parliamentary parties, the membership and composition of the shadow cabinet is generally determined solely by the shadow prime minister.

A related term is the shadow budget, which is often prepared by shadow cabinets (and, when released, usually presented by the shadow finance minister or equivalent) as an alternative to the real budget presented by the government. When prepared and released in an election year, an opposition party&#x27;s shadow budget will typically form a key part of the party&#x27;s manifesto, and will be largely if not wholly implemented if the opposition party subsequently forms a government (especially if it wins an outright majority).

===Third parties===
In many jurisdictions, third parties (who are neither participant in the government nor in the official opposition) may also form their own parliamentary front benches of spokespersons; however, parliamentary standing orders on the right of parties to speak often dictate that it can only be granted to a party or group if a minimum number of members can be recorded by the party. In Ireland, for example, technical groups are often formed by third parties and independent TDs in the Dáil Éireann in order to increase the members&#x27; right to speak against larger parties which can afford the right to speak as front benches in government or opposition.

Opposition parliamentary parties which are sufficiently small that they are about the same size as the government cabinet will often appoint all of their elected members to their shadow cabinet or equivalent, with third parties more likely compared to official opposition parties to use this sort of arrangement. If the parliamentary party is only slightly larger than the government&#x27;s cabinet, its leadership potentially faces the awkward position of embarrassing a small minority of legislators by singling them out for exclusion from the shadow cabinet. On the other hand, incoming governments in the Westminster system often change the number and/or composition of ministries upon assuming office. Therefore, one solution to such an aforementioned issue when it occurs is to create nominal shadow &quot;ministries&quot; that correspond to currently nonexistent cabinet posts the party actually intends to create once in government. An opposition party can also employ this process in reverse by &quot;merging&quot; its shadow ministries to correspond to actual cabinet posts the opposition party wants to merge or otherwise eliminate.

===Use outside English-speaking countries===
While the practice of parliamentary shadow cabinets or frontbenches is not widespread in Germany, party leaders have often formed boards of experts and advisors (&quot;teams of experts&quot;, or &quot;Kompetenzteam&quot;, in CDU/CSU and SPD parlance; alternate &quot;top team&quot;, or &quot;Spitzenteam&quot;, in Bündnis &#x27;90/Die Grünen parlance).

In France, although the formation of a shadow cabinet is not compulsory or common, several shadow cabinets have been formed.

In Hungary, a shadow cabinet under the leadership of Klára Dobrev was established by the strongest opposition party, the Democratic Coalition, for the first time, in 2022.

In Japan, the term &quot;Next Cabinet&quot; was coined for the de facto shadow cabinet, though it has only been used by the Democratic Party of Japan and its successors.

In Turkey, the main opposition party, CHP, formed a shadow cabinet after the election of Özgür Özel as its leader, in 2023.

<doc id="208566" wikidata="Q355811" url="?curid=208566" title="Marc Quinn">
<text>Marc Quinn (born 8 January 1964) is a British contemporary visual artist whose work includes sculpture, installation, and painting. Quinn explores &quot;what it is to be human in the world today&quot; through subjects including the body, genetics, identity, environment, and the media. His work has used materials that vary widely, from blood, bread and flowers, to marble and stainless steel. Quinn has been the subject of solo exhibitions at Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum, the Tate Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, Fondation Beyeler, Fondazione Prada, and South London Gallery. The artist was a notable member of the Young British Artists movement.

Quinn is internationally celebrated and was awarded the commission for the first edition of the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square in 2004, for which he exhibited &quot;Alison Lapper Pregnant&quot;. Quinn&#x27;s notorious frozen self-portrait series made of his own blood, &quot;Self&quot; (1991–present) was subject to a retrospective at Fondation Beyeler in 2009.

Quinn lives and works in London.

==Life and career==

Quinn was born in London on 8 January 1964 to a FRENCH mother and a British father. He spent his early years in Paris, where his father was a physicist working at the BIPM (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures). Quinn recalls an early fascination with the scientific instruments in his father&#x27;s laboratory, in particular atomic clocks. He attended Millfield (a private boarding-school in Somerset), and studied history and history of art at Robinson College, Cambridge.

In the early 1990s, Quinn was the first artist to be represented by gallerist Jay Jopling. The artist had his first exhibition with Jopling in 1991, exhibiting &quot;Self&quot; (1991), a frozen self-portrait made out of nine pints of the artist&#x27;s blood.

During the 1990s, Quinn and several peers were identified for their radical approach to the making and experiencing of art. In 1992, the loosely affiliated group was called the &#x27;Young British Artists&#x27; by writer Michael Corris in &quot;Artforum&quot;, and included Cornelia Parker, Sarah Lucas, Damien Hirst, Rachel Whiteread, and Tracey Emin.

In 1995, Quinn was given a solo exhibition at Tate Britain where new sculptures were shown as part of the Art Now series. In 1997 Quinn&#x27;s work &quot;Self&quot; (1991), was exhibited at the Royal Academy, London for the exhibition &quot;Sensation&quot;. Quinn&#x27;s &quot;Self&quot;, along with works by Sarah Lucas and Damien Hirst, were already well known to the British public. The exhibition received widespread media attention and had a record number of visitors for a contemporary art exhibition. The exhibition then travelled to the Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin, and to the Brooklyn Museum, New York.

In 1998, he was given a solo exhibition at the South London Gallery, and in 1999, he had a solo exhibition at Kunstverein Hannover. The Groninger Museum presented a solo exhibition of Quinn&#x27;s work in 2000. The artist was then invited to present a solo exhibition at the Fondazione Prada in Milan in 2000, where he presented an ambitious new work &quot;Garden.&quot; In 2002, he was given a solo exhibition at Tate Liverpool which included new works and photography, and coincided with the Liverpool Biennial, where Quinn presented &quot;1+1=3.&quot; In 2001, the National Portrait Gallery gave Quinn a solo exhibition for his genomic portrait of Sir John Sulston.

In 2004 Quinn was awarded the first ever commission for the Fourth Plinth in London&#x27;s Trafalgar Square, for which he produced a marble sculpture of pregnant disabled artist, Alison Lapper.

In 2006, Museo d&#x27;Arte Contemporanea Rome presented Marc Quinn&#x27;s works in a solo exhibition focused on his recent figurative sculpture, and in 2009, the Fondation Beyeler presented a solo exhibition of Marc Quinn&#x27;s ongoing series &quot;Self,&quot; including all sculptures from 1991 to 2006.

In 2012, Quinn was commissioned to produce a monumental work for the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games at the London Olympics 2012, for which he produced &quot;Breath&quot;, a monumental sculpture of Alison Lapper held up by air.

In 2013, Quinn presented a solo exhibition curated by Germano Celant during the 55th Venice Biennale for art, at Fondazione Giorgio Cini, Venice in a show of more than 50 works.

Quinn&#x27;s first monograph &quot;Memory Box&quot; by Germano Celant was published in 2013. A feature-length documentary about Quinn&#x27;s life and work, &quot;Making Waves&quot;, was released in 2014, produced and directed by Gerry Fox. London&#x27;s Somerset House presented a solo exhibition of Quinn in 2015, focusing on recent sculptures.

In 2017, Marc Quinn staged a major exhibition at the Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum in London. The exhibition was the first in a new series of collaborations with contemporary artists, designers, and architects, which, inspired by the spirit of Sir John Soane, sought to bring the collection to life in innovative ways.

==Works==
Quinn&#x27;s early work was concerned with issues of corporeality, decay, and preservation. He experimented with organic and degradable materials including bread, blood, lead, flowers and DNA producing sculpture and installation, including &quot;Bread Sculptures&quot; (1988), &quot;Self&quot; (1991), &quot;Emotional Detox&quot; (1995), &quot;Garden&quot; (2000), and &quot;DNA Portrait of John Sulston&quot; (2001). In the 2000s, he began to focus on the use of marble, bronze, and concrete. The artist explored the body and its extremes through the lens of classical and urban materials; works included &quot;The Complete Marbles&quot; (1999–2005), &quot;Alison Lapper Pregnant&quot; (2004), &quot;Evolution&quot; (2005–2009) and &quot;Planet&quot; (2008). Since 2010 he has worked with metals including stainless steel, aluminium, graffiti paints, seaside detritus, tapestry and painting, as seen in &quot;The History Paintings&quot; (2009–present) and &quot;The Toxic Sublime&quot; (2014–present).

==Early works: 1991–2000==
===&quot;Self&quot;, 1991 – present===
The first work of Quinn&#x27;s to gain international fame was &quot;Self&quot;, which was exhibited in 1991, when he was 27. &quot;Self&quot; (1991) is a self-portrait formed by a frozen cast of 10 pints of the artist&#x27;s blood. It is an ongoing work, where the artist portrays himself every five years through a new cast with new blood.
The artworks are placed in transparent plexiglass-glass boxes, on top of freezing cabinets. This highlights a theme of the works, which is dependency.

&quot;Self&quot; (2006) is owned by the National Portrait Gallery, London.

=== &quot;Emotional Detox&quot;, 1995 ===
In 1995 Quinn produced &quot;Emotional Detox&quot;, a series of seven sculptures made of lead and cast from the artist&#x27;s own body, were created at this time. Inspired by traditional iconography of the seven deadly sins, in each sculpture Quinn&#x27;s body is being torn apart and reconfigured, reflecting detoxification as both a physical and psychological battle.

&quot;Emotional Detox&quot; has been exhibited at Tate Britain, London (1995), Groninger Museum, The Netherlands (2000), and Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (2015).

===&quot;Garden&quot; (2000) ===

In 2000, Quinn was given a solo exhibition at the Fondazione Prada, Milan, which included his most ambitious works, involving organic matter. &quot;Garden&quot; is a 12-metre-long, 3-metre-high sculpture in which thousands of flowers are frozen in silicone oil. The work now belongs to the Fondazione Prada collection)

== Notable works: 2000–2010 ==
===&quot;Portrait of John E. Sulston&quot; (2001) ===
Quinn&#x27;s portrait of John E. Sulston, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2002 for sequencing the human genome on the Human Genome Project, is in the National Portrait Gallery. It consists of bacteria containing Sulston&#x27;s DNA in agar jelly. &quot;The portrait was made by our standard methods for DNA cloning&quot;, writes Sulston. &quot;My DNA was broken randomly into segments, and treated so that they could be replicated in bacteria. The bacteria containing the DNA segments were spread out on agar jelly in the plate you see in the portrait.&quot;

===&quot;Alison Lapper, The Fourth Plinth&quot; (2005–2007) ===
Quinn has made a series of marble sculptures of people either born with limbs missing or who have had them amputated. This culminated in his 15-ton marble statue of Alison Lapper, a fellow artist born with no arms and severely shortened legs, which was displayed on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square, London from September 2005 until October 2007. (The Fourth Plinth is used for rotating displays of sculpture.) In &quot;Disability Studies Quarterly&quot;, Ann Millett writes, &quot;The work has been highly criticized for capitalizing on the shock value of disability, as well as lauded for its progressive social values. Alison Lapper Pregnant and the controversy surrounding it showcase disability issues at the forefront of current debates in contemporary art&quot;.

A large reproduction of the sculpture was used as a central element of the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony.

===&quot;Sphinx&quot; (2006) and &quot;Siren&quot; (2008) ===

Since 2006, Marc Quinn has made numerous studies of the supermodel Kate Moss. In April 2006, &quot;Sphinx&quot;, a sculpture of Kate Moss by Quinn, was revealed. The sculpture shows Moss in a yoga position with her ankles and arms wrapped behind her ears. This body of work culminated in an exhibition at the Mary Boone Gallery in New York in May 2007. The sculpture is on permanent display in Folketeatret in Oslo, Norway.

In August 2008, Quinn unveiled another sculpture of Moss in solid 18-carat gold called &quot;Siren&quot;, which was exhibited at the British Museum in London. The life-size sculpture was promoted as &quot;the largest gold statue since ancient Egypt&quot;.

===&quot;History Paintings&quot; (2009 – present)===
In 2009 Quinn began his &quot;History Paintings&quot; series which has continued to evolve.  The initial group of work in this effort were of enlarged press photos of conflicts around the world rendered into oil on canvas paintings or silk or wool jacquard tapestries.

== Notable works: 2010 – present ==
In May 2010, Quinn revealed a series of new sculptures at London&#x27;s White Cube gallery including &quot;The Ecstatic Autogenesis of Pamela&quot; based on film actress Pamela Anderson and &quot;Chelsea Charms&quot; based on pornography model Chelsea Charms.

Quinn&#x27;s models have included &quot;Catman&quot; Dennis Avner (who has been tattooed to look like a cat) and transgender people such as Thomas Beatie, Buck Angel, and Allanah Starr. Quinn&#x27;s portrait sculpture &quot;Buck &amp; Allanah&quot; depicts the two nude, standing hand in hand, in a pose reminiscent of Adam and Eve. The sculpture of Thomas Beatie depicts him at full-term pregnancy, bowing his head and cradling his abdomen with two hands.

The exhibition also included a new series of flower paintings executed in reversed colour and two large-scale orchid sculptures in white painted bronze, installed in Hoxton Square, opposite the gallery.

===&quot;The Toxic Sublime&quot; (2015) ===
In 2015 Marc Quinn opened an exhibition of new work at White Cube Bermondsey, entitled &quot;The Toxic Sublime&quot;. It featured new bodies of work that explore the ecological impact of man on nature. ‘The Toxic Sublimes’ are distorted, three dimensional seascapes. Alongside these paintings, a new series of sculptures, cast in stainless steel, including one measuring over 7.5 meters long, form part of a body of work titled &quot;Frozen Waves&quot;. The sculptures originate from the core of shells, eroded by the endless action of waves.

=== &quot;All About Love&quot; (2016–2017) ===
In 2017, Quinn was given a solo exhibition at Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum in London. A display of 12 life-cast sculptures, the &quot;All About Love&quot; series explore the notion of love through the expression of classical fragmented sculpture. Created in collaboration with his partner at the time, the sculptures, which depict the two embracing one another, are works that echo sculptures of many periods from the Renaissance to Auguste Rodin.

=== &quot;A Surge of Power (Jen Reid)&quot; 2020 ===
The sculpture &quot;A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020&quot; was erected secretly in Bristol in the early morning of 15 July 2020; it is Quinn&#x27;s statue of Black Lives Matter protester, Jen Reid. The statue was mounted on the plinth which formerly held a 19th-century statue of Edward Colston, a Bristol merchant, philanthropist, and Tory Member of Parliament (MP) who had been involved in the Atlantic slave trade. Just over 24 hours after the statue was installed, the Bristol City Council had it taken down as it did not have permission to be installed. The Mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, invited Quinn to make a contribution towards the cost to the council of having his statue removed.

===&quot;Viral Paintings&quot; (2020)===
This currently ongoing series of paintings by Quinn are of paint splattered over blown up screen shots of photos and news stories of current events taken on his cell phone and created during and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These new works are considered a continuation of his &quot; History Painting&quot; series begun in 2009.

==Charity auctions==
Quinn has participated in a number of charity auctions since 2010. His work was auctioned for the UK&#x27;s homelessness charity, Crisis, in collaboration with Vogue at Christie&#x27;s in 2010. In 2013, he donated work to the Mimi Foundation charity for cancer auction at Sotheby&#x27;s. He donated work to the charity auction for Peace One Day at Bonhams, curated by Jake Chapman, in 2014 and 2015.

In 2013 Quinn was commissioned to make a work for RHS Chelsea Flower Show, marking the first time an artist collaborated with the flower show in its 100-year history. &quot;The Rush of Nature&quot; (2013) was auctioned at Sotheby’s to help raise money for RHS Chelsea Centenary Appeal.

Work by Quinn was auctioned at the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation annual St. Tropez Gala in 2016, supporting environmental protection.

<text>Mohammed al-Khamis bin Yusef bin Hassan al-Alawi, better known simply as Mohammed V (10 August 1909 – 26 February 1961), was the last Sultan of Morocco from 1927 to 1953 and from 1955 to 1957, and first King of Morocco from 1957 to 1961. A member of the &#x27;Alawi dynasty, he played an instrumental role in securing the independence of Morocco from the French and Spanish Protectorates.

Mohammed was enthroned as sultan upon the death of his father Yusef bin Hassan in 1927. Early in his reign, his approval of the Berber Dahir drew widespread backlash and spurred an upsurge of Moroccan nationalism and opposition to continued French rule. Initially more amenable to colonial authorities, Mohammed grew increasingly supportive of the nationalist movement later on. During World War II he supported the Allies, participated in the 1943 Anfa Conference and took steps to protect Moroccan Jews from Vichy persecution.

Mohammed became a central figure of the independence cause after the war. In 1947, he delivered a historic speech in Tangier, in which he made an open appeal for Moroccan independence and emphasized the country&#x27;s ties with the rest of the Arab world. His relationship with the French became increasingly strained afterwards as colonial rule grew more repressive. In 1953, French authorities deposed Mohammed, exiled him to Corsica (later transferring him to Madagascar) and installed his first cousin once removed Mohammed Ben Aarafa as sultan. The deposition sparked active opposition to the French protectorate and two years later, faced with rising violence in Morocco, the French government allowed Mohammed&#x27;s return. In 1956, he successfully negotiated with France and Spain for Moroccan independence, and in the following year he assumed the title of king. Mohammed died in 1961 at the age of 51 and was succeeded by his eldest son, who took the throne as Hassan II.

==Biography==
=== Early life and education (1909–1927) ===
Sidi Mohammed bin Yusef was born on 10 August 1909 in Fes, and was his father&#x27;s third son. In March 1912, the Treaty of Fes was signed, turning Morocco into a French protectorate after a French invasion from the west and the east, resulting in an eventual capture of the capital, Fes. 

Sidi Mohammed began his education home schooled in Fes, inside the palace grounds of &quot;qasr al-amami&quot; (front palace). There he learned to read and write and received the first lessons of Quran.

When his father established Rabat as the capital of the kingdom and of the administration, he transferred Sidi Mohammed there, with most of his brothers. There, he was home schooled with private teachers.

In Rabat, teachers taught him Quran until he became &quot;hafiz&quot;. After which he began his academic learning. He studied Arabic and French, his father having appointed teachers to carry out this task. Mohammed Mammeri taught him French and gave him special attention. Sultan, he remained in his service for a long time as head of protocol.

Sidi Mohammed then continued his education in a public school in Rabat.

=== Beginning of his reign (1927–1939) ===

Mohammed V was one of the sons of Sultan Yusef, who was enthroned by the French in September 1912 and his wife Yaqut. On 18 November 1927, a &quot;young and timid&quot; 17-year-old Muhammad bin Yusef was enthroned after the death of his father and the departure of Hubert Lyautey.

He married Hanila bint Mamoun in 1925 and in 1928, he married Abla bint Tahar, the latter gave birth to Hassan II in 1929. Finally he married Bahia bint Antar.

===During World War II (1939–1945)===
At the time of Mohammed&#x27;s enthronement, the French colonial authorities were &quot;pushing for a more assertive &#x27;native policy.&#x27;&quot; On 16 May 1930, Sultan Muhammad V signed the Berber Dahir, which changed the legal system in parts of Morocco where Berber languages were primarily spoken (&quot;Bled es-Siba&quot;), while the legal system in the rest of the country (&quot;Bled al-Makhzen&quot;) remained the way it had been before the French invasion. Although the sultan was under no duress, he was only 20 years old. This &quot;dhahir&quot; &quot;electrified the nation&quot;; it was sharply criticized by Moroccan nationalists and catalyzed the Moroccan Nationalist Movement.

Sultan Muhammad V participated in the Anfa Conference hosted in Casablanca during World War II. On 22 January 1943, he met privately with the US president Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the Prime Minister of the UK Winston Churchill. At this dinner, Roosevelt assured the sultan that &quot;the post-war scene and the pre-war scene would ... sharply differ, especially as they related to the colonial question.&quot; The sultan&#x27;s 14-year-old son and future king of Morocco, Hassan II, also attended and later stated that Roosevelt said, &quot;Ten years from now your country will be independent.&quot;

&quot;There are competing accounts of exactly what Mohammed V did or did not do for the Moroccan Jewish community&quot; during the Holocaust. However, &quot;though a subject of debate, most scholars stress the benevolence of Mohammed V toward the Jews&quot; during the Vichy era. Mohammed reportedly refused to sign off on efforts by Vichy officials to impose anti-Jewish legislation upon Morocco and deport the country&#x27;s 250,000 Jews to their deaths in Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps in Europe. The sultan&#x27;s stand was &quot;based as much on the insult the Vichy &quot;diktats&quot; posed to his claim of sovereignty over all his subjects, including the Jews, as on his humanitarian instincts.&quot; Partial Nazi race measures were enacted in Morocco over Mohammed&#x27;s objection, and Mohammed did sign, under the instructions of Vichy officials, two decrees that barred Jews from certain schools and positions.

Nevertheless, Mohammed is highly esteemed by Moroccan Jews who credit him for protecting their community from the Nazi and Vichy French government, and Mohammed V has been honored by Jewish organizations for his role in protecting his Jewish subjects during the Holocaust. Some historians maintain that Mohammed&#x27;s anti-Nazi role has been exaggerated; historian Michel Abitol writes that while Mohammed V was compelled by Vichy officials to sign the anti-Jewish dahirs, &quot;he was more passive than Moncef Bay (ruler of Tunisia during the Second World War) in that he did not take any side and did not engage in any public act that could be interpreted as a rejection of Vichy&#x27;s policy.&quot;

=== Struggle for independence (1945–1953) ===

Sultan Mohammad was a central figure in the independence movement in Morocco, also known as the Revolution of the King and the People (). This Moroccan Nationalist Movement grew from protests regarding the Berber Dahir of 16 May 1930. He was critical of early movements for reform in French colonial administration in Morocco before becoming a supporter of independence later on.

His central position in the Proclamation of Independence of Morocco further boosted his image as a national symbol. On 9 and 10 April 1947, he delivered two momentous speeches respectively at the Mendoubia and Grand Mosque of Tangier, together known as the Tangier Speech, appealing for the independence of Morocco without calling out specific colonial powers.

In 1947, the rapid progress of the nationalist movement prompted Sidi Mohammed to demand independence for the first time during the Tangier speech, where he also called for the union of the Arabs and Morocco&#x27;s membership of the Arab League which was founded in 1945, in which he praised, emphasized the close ties between Morocco and the rest of the Arab world. This rapprochement between the monarchy and the nationalist movement, whose projects differ, can be explained, according to historian Bernard Cubertafond, by the fact that &quot;each side needs the other: the national movement sees the growing popularity of the king and his prudent but gradual emancipation from a protector who, in fact, left the treaty of 1912 to come to direct administration; the king cannot, except to discredit himself, cut himself off from a nationalist movement bringing together the living forces of his country and the elite of his youth, and he needs this power of protest to impose changes on France”.

From then on, relations became strained with the French authorities, in particular with the new Resident General, General Alphonse Juin, who applied severe measures and pressured the sultan to disavow the Istiqlal and distance himself from nationalist claims. The break with France was consummated in 1951 and Sidi Mohammed concluded with the nationalists the pact of Tangier to fight for independence. The appointment of a new Resident General, General Augustin Guillaume, accentuated the dissension between Mohammed and France. Further demonstrations turn into riots in Morocco in 1952, notably in Casablanca, while Sidi Mohammed gives the Moroccan cause an international audience at the UN with the support of the United States.

=== Deposition and exile (1953–1955) ===
On 20 August 1953 (the eve of Eid al-Adha), the French colonial authorities forced Mohammed V, an important national symbol in the growing Moroccan independence movement, into exile in Corsica along with his family. His first cousin once removed, Mohammed Ben Aarafa, called the &quot;French sultan,&quot; was made a puppet monarch and placed on the throne. In response, Muhammad Zarqtuni bombed Casablanca&#x27;s Central Market on Christmas Eve of that year.

Mohammed and his family were then transferred to Madagascar in January 1954. Mohammed returned from exile on 16 November 1955, and was again recognized as Sultan after active opposition to the French protectorate. His triumphant return was for many the sign of the end of the colonial era. The situation became so tense that in 1955, the Moroccan nationalists, who enjoyed support in Libya, Algeria (with the FLN) and Egypt forced the French government to negotiate and recall the sultan. In February 1956 he successfully negotiated with France and Spain for the independence of Morocco.

=== After independence (1956–1961) ===

Mohammed supported the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) in the struggle for Algerian Independence and offered to facilitate the participation of FLN leaders in a conference with Habib Bourguiba in Tunis. On October 22, 1956, French forces hijacked a Moroccan airplane carrying leaders of the FLN during the ongoing Algerian War. The plane, which was carrying Ahmed Ben Bella, Hocine Aït Ahmed, and Mohamed Boudiaf, was destined to leave from Palma de Mallorca for Tunis, but French forces redirected the flight to occupied Algiers, where the FLN leaders were arrested.

In 1957, he took the title of King of Morocco, to symbolise the unity of the country despite the divisions between Arabs and Berbers. In terms of domestic policy, upon his return he allowed the first congress of the Istiqlal, which formed various governments under his reign. He authorized the creation of trade unions, but the unrest and the strikes lead him to take full power in the last years of his reign. His state visit to the United States later that year &quot;strengthened his position as the kingdom&#x27;s sole legitimate representative&quot;. This way he managed to replace the members of the nationalist movement on the global stage and turned his trip into a great publicity success. This visit marked a strategic effort to align Morocco closely with the US, showcasing the monarchy&#x27;s importance on the global stage. He used various techniques to project the royal authority, such as personally thanking the nationalist movement&#x27;s former supporters in the name of the Moroccan people. Mohammed V also acted as patron to the &quot;International Meetings&quot;, conferences on contemporary issues and interfaith dialogue hosted at the Benedictine monastery of Toumliline that attracted scholars and intellectuals from all over the world.

During his reign, the Moroccan Liberation Army waged war against Spain and France, and successfully captured most of Ifni as well as Cape Juby and parts of Spanish Sahara. With the treaty of Angra de Cintra, Morocco annexed Cape Juby and the surroundings of Ifni, while the rest of the remaining colony was ceded by Spain in 1969.

=== Death (1961) ===
On 26 February 1961, Mohammed died from complications of a banal surgery on the nasal septum carried out by a surgeon from Vaud. His death was announced on national radio by his son, crown prince Moulay Hassan, who succeeded him as King Hassan II.

== Nasab ==
Mohammed V&#x27;s nasab is Mohammed bin Yusef bin Hassan bin Muhammad bin Abd al-Rahman bin Hisham bin Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Ismail bin Sharif bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Ali bin Youssef bin Ali bin Al Hassan bin Muhammad bin Al Hassan bin Qasim bin Muhammad bin Abi Al Qasim bin Muhammad bin Al-Hassan bin Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Arafa bin Al-Hassan bin Abi Bakr bin Ali bin Al-Hasan bin Ahmed bin Ismail bin Al-Qasim bin Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya bin Abdullah al-Kamil bin Hassan al-Muthanna bin Hasan bin Ali bin Abi Talib bin Abd al-Muttalib bin Hashim.

==Legacy==

The Mohammed V International Airport, Stade Mohammed V and Mohammed V Square in Casablanca, the Mohammed V Avenue, Mohammed V University and Mohammadia School of Engineering in Rabat, and the Mohammed V Mosque in Tangier are among numerous buildings, locales and institutions named after him. There&#x27;s a mausoleum of Mohammed V in Rabat. There is an Avenue Mohammed V in nearly every Moroccan city and a major one in Tunis, Tunisia, and in Algiers, Algeria. The Mohammed V Palace in Conakry, Guinea, is named in his honour.

In December 2007, &quot;The Jewish Daily Forward&quot; reported on a secret diplomatic initiative by the Moroccan government to have Mohammed V admitted to the Righteous Among the Nations.

<doc id="208571" wikidata="Q108704579" url="?curid=208571" title="Yahoo! Inc. (1995–2017)">
<text>Yahoo! Inc. was an American multinational technology company headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. Yahoo was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995. Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early internet era in the 1990s. Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, was CEO and president of Yahoo from July 2012 until June 2017.

It was globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo! Search, and related services, including Yahoo! Directory, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Groups, Yahoo! Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. At its height, it was one of the most popular sites in the United States. According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo! was the highest-read news and media website, with over seven billion views per month, being the sixth most visited website globally in 2016 According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visited Yahoo websites every month. Yahoo itself claimed it attracted &quot;more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages&quot;.

Once the most popular website in the U.S., Yahoo slowly started to decline since the late 2000s, and on February 21, 2017, Verizon Communications announced its intent to acquire old Yahoo&#x27;s internet business (excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan) for $4.48 billion—the company was once valued at over $100 billion. Before the transaction was completed, the company expected to change its name to Altaba Inc. Verizon completed its acquisition of the old iteration of Yahoo! Inc&#x27;s internet business on June 13, 2017. Verizon announced that the old Yahoo! Inc&#x27;s internet assets would be combined under a new subsidiary, Oath, which later became known as Verizon Media in 2019 and eventually renamed to the current iteration of Yahoo! Inc. in 2021.

==History==

===Founding===

In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named &quot;Jerry and David&#x27;s guide to the World Wide Web&quot;. The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, &quot;Jerry and David&#x27;s Guide to the World Wide Web&quot; was renamed &quot;Yahoo!&quot;, the human-edited Yahoo! Directory, provided for users to surf through the internet, being their first product and original purpose. The &quot;yahoo.com&quot; domain was created on January 18, 1995.

The word &quot;yahoo&quot; is a backronym for &quot;Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle&quot; or &quot;Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle&quot;. The term &quot;hierarchical&quot; described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term &quot;oracle&quot; was intended to mean &quot;source of truth and wisdom&quot;, and the term &quot;officious&quot;, rather than being related to the word&#x27;s normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work. However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a &quot;yahoo&quot; (used by college students in David Filo&#x27;s native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): &quot;rude, unsophisticated, uncouth.&quot; This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. 

===Expansion===
Yahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal. By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine. It also made many high-profile acquisitions. 

Yahoo!&#x27;s initial public offering at the NASDAQ was on April 12, 1996, closing at US$33.00—up 270 percent from the IPO price—after peaking at $43.00 for the day. Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, closing at an all-time high of $118.75 a share on January 3, 2000. However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.
Yahoo began using Google for search in 2000. Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004. In response to Google&#x27;s Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. The company struggled through 2008, with several large layoffs.

In February 2008, Microsoft made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion. Yahoo formally rejected the bid, claiming that it &quot;substantially undervalues&quot; the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. Three years later, Yahoo had a market capitalization of $22.24 billion. Carol Bartz replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009. In September 2011, she was removed from her position at Yahoo by the company&#x27;s chairman Roy Bostock, and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company.

In early 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, rumors began to spread about looming layoffs. Several key executives, such as Chief Product Officer Blake Irving, left. On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced a cut of 2,000 jobs or about 14 percent of its 14,100 workers. The cut was expected to save around $375 million annually after the layoffs were completed at end of 2012. In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. He also completely reorganized the company.

On May 13, 2012, Yahoo issued a press release stating that Thompson was no longer with the company, and would immediately be replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo&#x27;s new Media group. Thompson&#x27;s total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million.

On July 16, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed president and CEO of Yahoo, effective the following day.
On May 19, 2013, the Yahoo board approved a $1.1 billion purchase of blogging site Tumblr. Tumblr&#x27;s CEO and founder David Karp would remain a large shareholder. The announcement reportedly signified a changing trend in the technology industry, as large corporations like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google acquired start-up Internet companies that generated low amounts of revenue as a way in which to connect with sizeable, fast-growing online communities. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; stated that the purchase of Tumblr would satisfy Yahoo&#x27;s need for &quot;a thriving social-networking and communications hub.&quot; On May 20, the company announced the acquisition of Tumblr officially. The company also announced plans to open a San Francisco office in July 2013.

On August 2, 2013, Yahoo acquired Rockmelt; its staff was retained, but all of its existing products were terminated.

Data collated by comScore during July 2013, revealed that more people in the U.S. visited Yahoo websites during the month in comparison to Google; the occasion was the first time that Yahoo outperformed Google since 2011. The data did not count mobile usage, nor Tumblr.

In November 2014, Yahoo! announced that it would acquire the video advertising provider BrightRoll for $640 million.

On November 21, 2014, it was announced that Yahoo had acquired Cooliris.

===Decline, security breaches, Verizon purchase===
By the fourth quarter of 2013, the company&#x27;s share price had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took over as president in July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013. It did go up to $36.04 in the mid afternoon of December 2, 2015, perhaps on news that the board of directors was meeting to decide on the future of Mayer, whether to sell the struggling internet business, and whether to continue with the spinoff of its stake in China&#x27;s Alibaba e-commerce site. Not all had gone well during Mayer&#x27;s tenure, including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that had yet to prove beneficial and the forays into original video content that led to a $42 million write-down. Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth College&#x27;s Tuck School of Business, told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that sometimes, &quot;the single best thing you can do ... is sell the company.&quot; The closing price of Yahoo! Inc. on December 7, 2015, was $34.68.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;″s Douglas MacMillan reported on February 2, 2016, that Yahoo&#x27;s CEO Marissa Mayer was expected to cut 15% of its workforce.

On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications announced that it had agreed to purchase Yahoo&#x27;s core internet business for $4.83 billion. Following the conclusion of the purchase, these assets will be merged with AOL to form a new entity known as Oath; Yahoo, AOL, and Huffington Post will continue to operate under their own names, under the Oath umbrella. The deal excludes Yahoo&#x27;s 15% stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5% stake in Yahoo! Japan; following the completion of the acquisition, these assets will be retained under the name Altaba, with a new executive team.

On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach that occurred in late 2014, in which information associated with at least 500 million user accounts, one of the largest breaches reported to date. The United States have indicted four men, including two employees of Russia&#x27;s Federal Security Service (FSB), for their involvement in the hack. On December 14, 2016, the company revealed that another separate data breach had occurred in 2014, with hackers obtaining sensitive account information, including security questions, to at least one billion accounts. The company stated that hackers had utilized stolen internal software to &quot;forge&quot; cookies.

In response to these breaches, &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; reported that Verizon was attempting to re-negotiate the deal to reduce the purchase price by $250 million, causing a 2% increase in Yahoo stock prices. On February 21, 2017, Verizon agreed to lower its purchase price for Yahoo! by $350 million, and share liabilities regarding the investigation into the data breaches.

On June 8, 2017, Yahoo shareholders approved the company&#x27;s sale of some of its Internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.

==Products and services==
Yahoo operated a portal that provides the latest news, entertainment, and sports information. The portal also gave users access to other Yahoo services like Yahoo! Search, Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Maps, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Groups and Yahoo Messenger.

===Communication===
Yahoo provided Internet communication services such as Yahoo Messenger and Yahoo Mail. As of May 2007, its e-mail service would offer unlimited storage.

Yahoo provided social networking services and user-generated content, including products such as My Web, Yahoo Personals, Yahoo 360°, Delicious, Flickr, and Yahoo Buzz. Yahoo closed Yahoo Buzz, MyBlogLog, and numerous other products on April 21, 2011.

Yahoo Photos was closed on September 20, 2007, in favor of Flickr. On October 16, 2007, Yahoo announced that it would discontinue Yahoo 360°, including bug repairs; the company explained that in 2008 it would instead establish a &quot;universal profile&quot; similar to the Yahoo Mash experimental system.

===Content===
Yahoo partners with numerous content providers in products such as Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Music, Yahoo Movies, Yahoo Weather, Yahoo News, Yahoo! Answers and Yahoo Games to provide news and related content. Yahoo provides a personalization service, My Yahoo, which enables users to combine their favorite Yahoo features, content feeds and information onto a single page.

On March 31, 2008, Yahoo launched Shine, a site tailored for women seeking online information and advice between the ages of 25 and 54.
===Co-branded Internet services===
Yahoo developed partnerships with broadband providers such as AT&amp;T Inc. (via Prodigy, BellSouth &amp; SBC), Verizon Communications, Rogers Communications, and British Telecom, offering a range of free and premium Yahoo content and services to subscribers.

===Mobile services===
Yahoo Mobile offers services for email, instant messaging, and mobile blogging, as well as information services, searches and alerts. Services for the camera phone include entertainment and ring tones.

Yahoo introduced its Internet search system, called OneSearch, for mobile phones on March 20, 2007. The results include news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, OneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing the movie, along with user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. A zip code or city name is required for OneSearch to start delivering local search results.

The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories.

As of 2012, Yahoo used Novarra&#x27;s mobile content transcoding service for OneSearch.

On October 8, 2010, Yahoo announced plans to bring video chat to mobile phones via Yahoo Messenger.

===Commerce===
Yahoo offers shopping services such as Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo Autos, Yahoo Real Estate and Yahoo Travel, which enables users to gather relevant information and make commercial transactions and purchases online. Yahoo Auctions were discontinued in 2007 except for Asia. Yahoo Shopping is a price comparison service which uses the Kelkoo price comparison service it acquired in April 2004.

===Small business===
Yahoo provides business services such as Yahoo DomainKeys, Yahoo Web Hosting, Yahoo Merchant Solutions, Yahoo Business Email and Yahoo Store to small business owners and professionals allowing them to build their own online stores using Yahoo&#x27;s tools.

===Advertising===
Yahoo Search Marketing provides services such as Sponsored Search, Local Advertising and Product/Travel/Directory Submit that let different businesses advertise their products and services on the Yahoo network.

Following the closure of a &quot;beta&quot; version on April 30, 2010, the Yahoo Publisher Network was re-launched as an advertising tool that allows online publishers to monetize their websites through the use of site-relevant advertisements.

Yahoo launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007, called Panama. It allows advertisers to bid for search terms to trigger their ads on search results pages. The system considers bids, ad quality, clickthrough rates and other factors in ranking ads. Through Panama, Yahoo aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, and to increase monetization.

On April 7, 2008, Yahoo announced APT from Yahoo, which was originally called AMP from Yahoo, an online advertising management platform. The platform simplifies advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. The service was launched in September 2008.

In September 2011, Yahoo formed an ad selling strategic partnership with 2 of its top competitors, AOL and Microsoft. But by 2013, this was found to be underperforming in market share and revenue, as Microsoft simply skimmed off four percent of the search market from Yahoo, without growing their combined share.

On September 27, 2023, Yahoo partnered with Good-Loop to offer carbon neutral private marketplace (PMP) media opportunities to help advertisers be more sustainable.

===GeoPlanet===
Yahoo offers cartographic and geographic services via GeoPlanet.

===Yahoo Next===
Yahoo Next is an incubation ground for future Yahoo technologies currently undergoing testing. It contains forums for Yahoo users to give feedback to assist in the development of these future Yahoo technologies.

===Yahoo BOSS===
Yahoo Search BOSS is a service that allows developers to build search applications based on Yahoo&#x27;s search technology. Early Partners in the program include Hakia, Me.dium, Delver, Daylife and Yebol.

In early 2011, the program switched to a paid model using a cost-per-query model from $0.40 to $0.75 CPM (cost per 1000 BOSS queries). The price, as Yahoo explained, depends on whether the query is of web, image, news or other information.

===Yahoo Meme===
Yahoo Meme is a beta social service, similar to the popular social networking sites Twitter and Jaiku.

===Y!Connect===
Y!Connect enables individuals to leave comments in online publication boards by using their Yahoo ID, instead of having to register with individual publications. The Wall Street Journal reported that Yahoo plans to mimic this strategy used by rival Facebook Inc. to help drive traffic to its site.

===Yahoo Accessibility===
Yahoo has invested resources to increase and improve access to the Internet for the disabled community through the Yahoo Accessibility Lab.

===Yahoo Axis===
Yahoo Axis is a desktop web browser extension and mobile browser for iOS devices created and developed by Yahoo. The browser made its public debut on May 23, 2012. A copy of the private key used to sign official Yahoo browser extensions for Google Chrome was accidentally leaked in the first public release of the Chrome extension.

===Yahoo SearchMonkey===
Yahoo SearchMonkey (often misspelled Search Monkey) was a Yahoo service which allowed developers and site owners to use structured data to make Yahoo Search results more useful and visually appealing, and drive more relevant traffic to their sites. The service was shut down in October 2010 along with other Yahoo services as part of the Microsoft and Yahoo search deal. The name SearchMonkey is an homage to Greasemonkey. Officially the product name has no space and two capital letters.

Yahoo SearchMonkey was selected as one of the top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2008.

===Defunct services===
Geocities was a popular web hosting service founded in 1995 and was one of the first services to offer web pages to the public. At one point it was the third-most-browsed site on the World Wide Web. Yahoo purchased GeoCities in 1999 and ten years later the web host was closed, deleting some seven million web pages. A great deal of information was lost but many of those sites and pages were mirrored at the Internet Archive, OOcities.com, and other such databases.

Yahoo Go, a Java-based phone application with access to most of Yahoo services, was closed on January 12, 2010.

Yahoo 360° was a blogging/social networking beta service launched in March 2005 by Yahoo and closed on July 13, 2009. Yahoo Mash beta was another social service closed after one year of operation prior to leaving beta status.

Yahoo Photos was shut down on September 20, 2007, in favor of integration with Flickr. Yahoo Tech was a website that provided product information and setup advice to users. Yahoo launched the website in May 2006. On March 11, 2010, Yahoo closed down the service and redirected users to Yahoo&#x27;s technology news section. Other discontinued services include Farechase, My Web, Audio Search, Pets, Live, Kickstart, Briefcase, and Yahoo for Teachers.

Hotjobs was acquired by and merged with Monster.com.

Yahoo Koprol was an Indonesian geo-tagging website that allowed users to share information about locations without the use of a GPS device. Koprol was acquired by Yahoo a year following its inception and, in 2011, 1.5 million people were utilizing the website, with users also based in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam. However, eighty percent of users were Indonesian. Yahoo officially discontinued Koprol on August 28, 2012, because it did &quot;not meaningfully drive revenue or engagement&quot;.

Yahoo Mail Classic was announced as to be shut down in April 2013. Yahoo made a notice that, starting in June 2013, Mail Classic and other old versions of Yahoo Mail will be shut down. All users of Mail Classic are expected to switch to the new Yahoo Mail, use IMAP, or switch to another email service. In addition, April 2013 brought the closure of Upcoming, Yahoo Deals, Yahoo SMS Alerts, Yahoo Kids, Yahoo Mail and Messenger feature phone (J2ME).

In early July 2013, Yahoo announced the scheduled closure of the task management service Astrid. Yahoo had acquired the company in May 2013 and was to discontinue the service on August 5, 2013. The team at Astrid has supplied its customers with a data export tool and recommended former competitors such as Wunderlist and Sandglaz.

====Twitter slide leak on changes to Yahoo====
On December 15, 2010, one day after Yahoo announced layoffs of 4% of its workers across their portfolio, MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier posted a slide from a Yahoo employee on Twitter. The slide was visible during an employee-only strategy webcast indicating changes in Yahoo&#x27;s offerings.

The following services were in a column under &quot;Sunset&quot;: Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog. Under the &quot;Merge&quot; column were: Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle.

11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the &quot;Sunset&quot; and &quot;Merge&quot; vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad. Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.

The blog on the &quot;del.icio.us&quot; website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that &quot;Sunset&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. Yeh further explained that other possibilities—including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)—were still being considered: &quot;We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press.&quot; On April 27, 2011, Yahoo&#x27;s sale of &quot;del.icio.us&quot; to Avos was announced.

Yahoo Buzz was closed down on April 21, 2011, without an official announcement from Yahoo. MyBlogLog was then discontinued by Yahoo on May 24, 2011.

==Privacy==
In September 2013, Yahoo&#x27;s transparency report said the company received 29 thousand requests for information about users from governments in the first six months of 2013. Over 12 thousand of the requests came from the United States.

In October 2013, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted communications between Yahoo&#x27;s data centers, as part of a program named Muscular.

In late January 2014, Yahoo announced on its company blog that it had detected a &quot;coordinated effort&quot; to hack into possibly millions of Yahoo Mail accounts. The company prompted users to reset their passwords, but did not elaborate on the scope of the possible breach, citing an ongoing federal investigation.

===Storing personal information and tracking usage===

Working with comScore, &quot;The New York Times&quot; found that Yahoo was able to collect far more data about users than its competitors from its Web sites and advertising network. By one measure, on average Yahoo had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors. Yahoo retains search requests for a period of 13 months. However, in response to European regulators, Yahoo obfuscates the IP address of users after three months by deleting its last eight bits.

On March 29, 2012, Yahoo announced that it would introduce a &quot;Do Not Track&quot; feature that summer, allowing users to opt out of Web-visit tracking and customized advertisements. However, on April 30, 2014, Yahoo announced that it would no longer support the &quot;Do Not Track&quot; browser setting.

According to a 2008 article in Computerworld, Yahoo has a 2-petabyte, specially built data warehouse that it uses to analyze the behavior of its half-billion Web visitors per month, processing 24 billion daily events. In contrast, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database of all United States taxpayers weighs in at only 150 terabytes.

In September 2016, it was reported that data from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts was stolen in 2014.

In October 2016, Reuters reported that in 2015, Yahoo! created a software to search their customers e-mail at the request of NSA or FBI.

==Criticism==
In 2000, Yahoo was taken to court in France by parties seeking to prevent French citizens from purchasing memorabilia relating to the Nazi Party. In March 2004, Yahoo launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo search engine. Yahoo discontinued the program at the end of 2009. Yahoo was criticized for providing ads via the Yahoo ad network to companies who display them through spyware and adware.

Yahoo, as well as other search engines, cooperated with the Chinese government in censoring search results. In April 2005, dissident Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in prison for &quot;providing state secrets to foreign entities&quot; as a result of being identified by IP address by Yahoo. Human rights organizations and the company&#x27;s general counsel disputed the extent of Yahoo&#x27;s foreknowledge of Shi&#x27;s fate. Human rights groups also accuse Yahoo of aiding authorities in the arrest of dissidents Li Zhi and Jiang Lijun. In April 2017, Yahoo was sued for failing to uphold settlement agreements in this case. Yahoo pledged to give support to the families of those arrested and create a relief fund for those persecuted for expressing their views online with Yahoo Human Rights Trust. Of the $17.3 million allotted to this fund, $13 million had been used for a townhouse in Washington, D.C., and other purchases.

In September 2003, dissident Wang Xiaoning was convicted of charges of &quot;incitement to subvert state power&quot; and was sentenced to ten years in prison. Yahoo Hong Kong connected Wang&#x27;s group to a specific Yahoo e-mail address. Both Xiaoning&#x27;s wife and the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo under human rights laws on behalf of Wang and Shi.

As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo&#x27;s &quot;user created&quot; chatrooms were closed down in June 2005. On May 25, 2006, Yahoo&#x27;s image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was active. Yahoo was a 40% (24% in September 2013) owner of Alibaba Group, which was a subject of controversy for allowing the sale of shark-derived products. The company banned the sale of shark fin products on all its e-commerce platforms effective January 1, 2009. On November 30, 2009, Yahoo was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending a DMCA notice to whistle-blower website &quot;Cryptome&quot; for publicly posting details, prices, and procedures on obtaining private information pertaining to Yahoo&#x27;s subscribers.

After some concerns over censorship of private emails regarding a website affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests were raised, Yahoo responded with an apology and explained it as an accident.

===Allegations of sexism against men===
Scott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo in 2015 has filed a lawsuit accusing Mayer of leading a sexist campaign to purge male employees. Ard, a male employee, stated &quot;Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management&#x27;s subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo&#x27;s male employees&quot;. In the suit Ard claimed prior to his firing, he had received &quot;fully satisfactory&quot; performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo&#x27;s home page, however, he was relieved of his role that was given to a woman who had been recently hired by Megan Lieberman, the editor-in-chief of Yahoo News.

The lawsuit states:
&quot;Liberman stated that she was terminating (Ard) because she had not received a requested breakdown of (his) duties. (Ard) had already provided that very information as requested, however, and reminded Liberman that he had done so. Liberman&#x27;s excuse for terminating (Ard) was a pretext.&quot;

A second sexual discrimination lawsuit was filed separately by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company&#x27;s performance management system was arbitrary and unfair, making it the second sexism lawsuit Yahoo and Meyer has faced in 2016.

Former chief operating officer Henrique de Castro departed from the company in January 2014 after Mayer, who initially hired him after her appointment as CEO, dismissed him. De Castro, who previously worked for Google and McKinsey &amp; Company, was employed to revive Yahoo&#x27;s advertising business.

==Yahoo International==
Yahoo offers a multi-lingual interface. The site is available in over 20 languages. The company&#x27;s international sites are wholly owned by Yahoo, with the exception of its Japan and China sites.

Yahoo holds a 34.75% minority stake in Yahoo Japan, while SoftBank holds 35.45%, Yahoo!Xtra in New Zealand, which Yahoo!7 have 51% of and 49% belongs to Telecom New Zealand, and Yahoo!7 in Australia, which is a 50–50 agreement between Yahoo and the Seven Network. Historically, Yahoo entered into joint venture agreements with SoftBank for the major European sites (UK, France and Germany) and well as South Korea and Japan. In November 2005, Yahoo purchased the minority interests that SoftBank owned in Europe and Korea.

On March 8, 2011, Yahoo launched its Romania local service after years of delay due to the financial crisis.

Yahoo officially entered the MENA region when it acquired Maktoob, a pan-regional, Arabic-language hosting and social services online portal, on August 25, 2009. Since the service is pan-regional, Yahoo officially became Yahoo Maktoob in the region.

On December 31, 2012, Yahoo Korea shut down all its services and left the country, with its previous domain saying in Korean, &quot;Starting from December 31, 2012, Yahoo! Korea has ended. You can go to the original Yahoo! for more Yahoo&#x27;s information.&quot; Sooner did that message also disappear, leaving with just an abandoned, empty search bar powered by Bing.

Yahoo used to hold a 40% stake in Alibaba, which manages a web portal in China using the Yahoo brand name. Yahoo in the USA does not have direct control over Alibaba, which operates as a completely independent company. On September 18, 2012, following years of negotiations, Yahoo agreed to sell a 20% stake back to Alibaba for $7.6 billion.

On September 2, 2013, Yahoo China shut down and was redirected to taobao.com, and has been being redirected to Yahoo Singapore&#x27;s search page.

==Logos and themes==


The first logo appeared when the company was founded in 1994—it was red with three icons on each side. The logo used on the Yahoo home page formerly consisted of the color red with a black outline and shadow; however, in May 2009, together with a theme redesign, the logo was changed to purple without an outline or shadow. This change also applied to several international Yahoo home pages. In some countries, most notably Yahoo!7 (of Australia), the logo remained red until 2014. On occasion the logo is abbreviated: &quot;Y!&quot;

On August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo announced that the final version of the new logo would be revealed on September 5, 2013, at 4:00 a.m. UTC. In the period leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, the &quot;30 Days of Change&quot; campaign was introduced, whereby a variation of the logo was published every day for the 30 days following the announcement. The new logo was eventually launched with an accompanying video that showed its digital construction, and Mayer published a personalized description of the design process on her Tumblr page. Mayer explains:
So, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team ... We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo – whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. Having a human touch, personal. Proud.

On September 19, 2013, Yahoo launched a new version of the &quot;My Yahoo&quot; personalized homepage. The redesign allows users to tailor a homepage with widgets that access features such as email accounts, calendars, Flickr and other Yahoo content, and Internet content. Users can also select &quot;theme packs&quot; that represent artists such as Polly Apfelbaum and Alec Monopoly, and bands such as Empire of the Sun. Mayer then explained at a conference in late September 2013 that the logo change was the result of feedback from both external parties and employees.

<doc id="208572" wikidata="Q3504012" url="?curid=208572" title="Optical window">
<text>The optical window is the portion of the optical spectrum that is blocked by the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The window runs from around 300 nanometers (ultraviolet-B) up into the range the human eye can detect, roughly 400–700 nm and continues up to approximately 2 μm. Sunlight mostly reaches the ground through the optical atmospheric window; the Sun is particularly active in most of this range (44% of the radiation emitted by the Sun falls within the visible spectrum and 49% falls within the infrared spectrum).

==Definition==
The Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is not totally transparent and is in fact 100% opaque to many wavelengths (see plot of Earth&#x27;s opacity); the wavelength ranges to which it is transparent are called atmospheric windows. 

=== Disambiguation of the term &#x27;optical spectrum&#x27; ===
Although the word &quot;optical&quot;, deriving from Ancient Greek ὀπτῐκός (optikós, &quot;of or for sight&quot;), generally refers to something visible or visual, the term &quot;optical spectrum&quot; is used to describe the sum of the visible, the ultraviolet and the infrared spectra (at least in this context). 

=== Optical atmospheric window ===

The optical atmospheric window is the optical portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that passes through the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, excluding its infrared part; although, as mentioned before, the optical spectrum also includes the IR spectrum and thus the optical window could include the infrared window (8 – 14 μm), the latter is considered separate by convention, since the visible spectrum is not contained in it.

== Historical importance for observational astronomy ==
Up until the 1940s, astronomers could only use the visible and near infrared portions of the optical spectrum for their observations. The first great astronomical discoveries such as the ones made by the famous Italian polymath Galileo Galilei were made using optical telescopes that received light reaching the ground through the optical window. After the 1940s, the development of radio telescopes gave rise to the even more successful field of radio astronomy that utilized the radio window.

<doc id="208574" wikidata="Q7793575" url="?curid=208574" title="Thomas Road Baptist Church">
<text>Thomas Road Baptist Church (TRBC) is a Baptist megachurch in Lynchburg, Virginia, located on the campus of Liberty University, which it founded and is closely affiliated with. In 2016, a church spokesperson stated they had an average weekly attendance of 9,000. The pastor is Jonathan Falwell, the son of previous Senior Pastor Jerry Falwell and brother of former Liberty University President, Jerry Falwell Jr. In addition to a second campus, Dan River Church, Thomas Road also hosts a Spanish congregation on its main campus. It is affiliated with the Baptist Bible Fellowship International and the Southern Baptist Convention.

==History==
Began in 1956 by a group of thirty-five members, including Jerry Falwell, Thomas Road now claims more than 24,200 members. The first meeting of Thomas Road was held on June 17 at Mountain View Elementary School. On June 24, 1956, The church held its first service in what was the former Donald Duck Bottling Company building. In 1964, Thomas Road moved into its second auditorium that seated 1,000 people. In 1969, the church broke ground for two educational buildings plus a new 3,000-seat sanctuary. In 1971, the church founded Lynchburg Baptist College, now known as Liberty University, as well as Liberty Christian Academy in 1967 (known as Lynchburg Christian Academy until it moved and was renamed in 2005). Until 2004, the church was the location for a nationally syndicated religious broadcast known as &quot;The Old-Time Gospel Hour&quot;. This program now airs only locally in Lynchburg. Selected sermons from the pulpit of the Thomas Road Baptist Church are now featured nationally on a syndicated program from Liberty University known as &quot;Live from Liberty&quot;.

The church occupied a new multimillion-dollar facility on July 2, 2006. The new building is connected to an over facility formerly owned and operated by GE and Ericsson Mobile Communications to manufacture mobile phones and other telecommunications equipment. The existing building has been renovated to house offices, university classes, the new Liberty University School of Law, and the Liberty Christian Academy. The church offers a variety of events and speakers, such as a creationist conference by Answers in Genesis.

Founding pastor Falwell served as its senior pastor until his death on May 15, 2007. In a special business meeting called by the board of deacons on June 3, 2007, Jonathan Falwell was unanimously elected by the to assume his father&#x27;s duties as senior pastor of the church. Jonathan Falwell had previously served as the church&#x27;s executive pastor since 1994.

==Affiliation==
Thomas Road Baptist Church was initially affiliated with the Baptist Bible Fellowship International. However, since 1998, it has a dual affiliation with the Baptist Bible Fellowship and the Southern Baptist Convention, having entered the convention by way of the Southern Baptist Conservatives of Virginia.

== Controversies ==
Jerry Falwell started Lynchburg Baptist College by selling bonds to a small group of private investors. However, in 1972, the Securities and Exchange Commission investigated the bonds alleging Falwell&#x27;s church committed &quot;fraud and deceit&quot; in the issuance of $6.5 million in unsecured church bonds. The church won a 1973 federal court case prosecuted at the behest of the SEC, in which the court exonerated the church and ruled that there had been no intentional wrongdoing.

In 1989, Jerry Falwell told Liberty University employees that membership in the church and tithing were mandatory.

<text>&quot;Power play&quot; is a sporting term used to describe a period of play where one team has a numerical advantage in players, usually due to a rule violation by the opposing team.

==Temporary numerical advantage in players during a team sport==
In several team sports, situations arise where following a rules infraction, one team is penalized by having the number of players on the field of play temporarily reduced. The term power play is commonly applied to the state of advantage the unpenalized team enjoys during this time. Specialized tactics and strategies can apply while a team is on the power play.
===Ice hockey===

In ice hockey, a team is considered to be on a power play when at least one opposing player is serving a penalty, and the team has a numerical advantage on the ice (whenever both teams have the same number of players on the ice, there is no power play). Up to two players per side may serve in the penalty box without substitutions being permitted, giving a team up to a possible 5-on-3 power play.

There are three types of penalties that can result in a power play for the non-offending team: minor (two minutes), double-minor (four minutes), and major (five minutes). For such penalties, the offending player is ruled off the ice and no substitute for the penalized player is permitted. If a goaltender commits either a minor, a double-minor, or a major penalty, another player who was on the ice at the time of the penalty would serve the penalty instead. A power play resulting from a minor penalty ends if the team with more players on the ice scores. A double-minor penalty is treated as if the player has committed two minor penalties back to back: a goal scored by the team with advantage in the first two minutes only ends the first minor penalty (and the second will start after the game restarts); a goal by the team with advantage in the last two minutes of the penalty will end the power play even if a goal was scored during the first part of the double-minor penalty. If a player is given a major penalty, a power play occurs, but the power play does not terminate even if the team on the power play scores (except in overtime as this ends the game); a major penalty only ends when five minutes have elapsed or the game has ended. A match penalty results in the offending player being ejected from the game (and the player is subject to possible further suspensions), but is otherwise treated the same as a major penalty.

If a team is still on a power play at the end of a regulation period, or at the end of a playoff overtime period, the power play will continue into the following period, although they do not carry into the next game of a series during the playoffs. &quot;Misconduct&quot; penalties (10 minutes in duration), and &quot;game misconduct&quot; penalties (offending player is ejected for the balance of the game) allow for substitution of the offending player, so do not result in power plays. However, in practice misconduct and game misconduct penalties are often assessed in addition to a major or minor penalty.

Special rules govern situations where three or more players on the same team must serve penalties simultaneously. They are designed to ensure a team can always have at least three skaters on the ice whilst also ensuring all penalties are fully &quot;served&quot; (assuming the game does not end first). In the simplest example, if Andy is assessed a minor penalty, followed by Barry, and both are still in the penalty box when Charlie also receives a minor penalty:
*Charlie may be substituted prior to play resuming;
*The two minutes Charlie must serve do not commence until Andy&#x27;s penalty expires or team on the power play scores, whichever comes first;
*If the team on the power play scores prior to Andy&#x27;s penalty expiring but before Barry&#x27;s, Andy&#x27;s penalty ends and he may leave the penalty box, but his team must still play two men short until Barry&#x27;s penalty expires;
*If the team on the power play does not score prior to Andy&#x27;s penalty expiring, Andy must remain in the penalty box until Barry&#x27;s penalty expires or there is a stoppage in play, whichever comes first;
*Provided there is no stoppage in play, Andy will leave the penalty box when Barry&#x27;s penalty expires, Barry will leave the penalty box when Charlie&#x27;s penalty expires (putting their team back at full strength) and Charlie will remain in the penalty box until the next stoppage in play.

A goal scored by the short-handed team during a power play is called a short-handed goal; However, a short-handed goal does not affect the power play, as the short-handed team must still serve the duration of the minor penalty. If a power play ends without a goal against the shorthanded team, it is said to have &quot;killed the penalty&quot;. If a team scores on the power play, it is said to have &quot;converted&quot; the power play (that is, converted the opportunity into a goal).

During a power play, the shorthanded team may launch the puck to the opposite end of the rink, and play will continue; icing is not called. The only exception is in U.S. youth hockey (14-and-under), in which icing is enforced at all times.

In leagues that conduct overtime with fewer than five skaters per side, the concept of the power play still exists, but its application is slightly modified. For example, the NHL uses a 3-on-3 format for overtime in the regular season, with three skaters plus the goaltender. If regulation play ends with a team on the power play, the advantaged team starts overtime with more than three skaters (almost always four, very rarely five). Similarly, if a player is penalized during overtime, the non-penalized team is allowed to play with an extra skater for the duration of the penalty, and with two extra skaters if two players on the same team are serving penalties.

===Lacrosse===
In box lacrosse, a power play is very similar to ice hockey, with two-minute minor penalties and five-minute majors. In field lacrosse, a similar type of penalty situation exists, though the duration of the penalty is only 30 seconds for technical fouls, one minute or more for personal fouls, and up to three minutes for use of an illegal stick, unsportsmanlike conduct and certain violent contact fouls such as targeting. Depending on the infraction, the penalty may &quot;release&quot; early if a goal is scored by the other team, or may be &quot;non-releasable&quot;, meaning the full duration must be served. The term &quot;power play&quot; is not used in field lacrosse, but called &quot;extra man offense&quot; (EMO) or &quot;man up&quot; for the team fouled and &quot;man down&quot; for the offending team.

===Muggle Quidditch===
In quidditch, a power play occurs when a member of the opposing team is given a blue, yellow, or red card. A player serving time for a blue card or yellow card must remain in the penalty box for one minute or until the other team scores. If a player is assessed a red card, that player is ejected from the game and a substitute must remain in the penalty box for two minutes. This two minutes must be served in full, regardless of how many times the opposing team scores during the penalty. A player receiving a second yellow card in the same game is automatically assessed a red card. Blue cards do not stack; a player may be assessed any number of blue cards without being automatically assessed a more severe card.

A team can never have a keeper in the penalty box. If the keeper is sent to the penalty box, the penalized keeper must immediately switch positions with a chaser teammate. If all chasers are already in the penalty box, the penalized keeper must switch with a beater or seeker teammate. If the keeper&#x27;s penalty results in that team having all of its players in play serving time in the penalty box, that team forfeits the game.

===Analogous concepts not generally referred to as a &quot;power play&quot;===
*In water polo, a shorter version of the ice hockey or lacrosse penalty situation exists as well. It is referred to as &quot;man up&quot; or &quot;man down&quot;.
*In futsal, there exists a situation which is essentially a power play. When a player is shown a red card and is thus ejected from the game, the penalized team must play short-handed for two minutes, similar to ice hockey. If a goal is scored, the team returns to full strength.
*In other forms of indoor soccer, usually played in the United States, there also exists a power play situation similar to ice hockey.
*In indoor American football, the 1988 proposed World Indoor Football League had intended to establish a perpetual power play, in which the offense would always have one man more on the field than the defense. Fan Controlled Football added the power play (explicitly identified as such) as one of its power-ups, a special one-play rule change that each team can exercise each half.
*In rugby union, a player who is shown a yellow card is ruled off the field of play for a period of ten minutes (two minutes in the seven-a-side variation). The player may not be replaced, their team must play one player short while they are off the field. The temporary sending-off is usually called a &quot;sin binning&quot;.
*In association football, a player who is shown a red card (whether or not it is a straight red or a second yellow) is ejected and may not be replaced to the remainder of the game; the team must play with one fewer player.

==Other uses of &quot;power play&quot;==

===Netball===
Several variant formats of netball introduce the concept of a power play, a designated quarter where all goals scored by a team are worth twice as normal:
*In the original fastnet format, when a team uses it in a quarter, all goals scored by that team are worth twice as normal. This means that if a shooter (Goal Shooter or Goal Attack) scores a goal outside the goal circle, the goal is worth 4 goals instead of 2. It is also possible for both teams to use their power play in the same quarter.
*In the current fast5 format, when a team uses it in a quarter, all goals scored by that team are worth twice as normal. A shooter that scores a goal within 3.5 meters from the goal post scores two points instead of one. Four points (instead of two) if the goal was scored at least 3.5 meters away from the goal post but within the goal circle. If the goal was scored from outside of the goal circle (known as a super goal), six points is scored instead of three. The winner of the coin toss chooses which quarter to have this power play and the other team must choose a different quarter for their power play. This prevents both teams from having their power plays in the same quarter.

===Cricket===

A powerplay is a feature introduced into One Day International (ODI) cricket in 1991 (and subsequently into Twenty20 and 100-ball cricket) concerning fielding restrictions. In a powerplay, restrictions are applied on the fielding team, with only two fielders allowed outside the 30-yard circle for a set number of overs. It is intended to add to the excitement by encouraging more aggressive batting. Prior to 2015, the batting team could declare a powerplay at a time of their choice during the innings, but as of 2015, the powerplay now occurs at set times, with an ODI innings now comprising three powerplays with varying levels of restrictions.

===Power Snooker===
In Power Snooker, this arises when a player pots the power ball. This triggers a period of time whereby all points scored are doubled.

===Roller Derby===
Commonly known as a &quot;power jam&quot;, a power play occurs in roller derby when a team&#x27;s designated scoring skater (jammer) is serving a penalty.

===Curling===
In the mixed doubles version of curling, a rule called a power play was introduced in the 2016–17 season. Each team can exercise the power play in one end per game, only when they have the hammer (throwing the last rock in an end). Instead of positioning the rock in the house on the center line, it is placed to a position straddling the edge of the eight-foot circle, with the back edge of the stone touching the tee line. The opponent&#x27;s guard stone is placed in line with the stone in the house and the hack. The power play cannot be used in an extra end.

<doc id="208579" wikidata="Q2000977" url="?curid=208579" title="Fifth-century Athens">
<text>Fifth-century Athens was the Greek city-state of Athens in the time from 480 to 404 BC. Formerly known as the Golden Age of Athens, the latter part being the Age of Pericles, it was buoyed by political hegemony, economic growth and cultural flourishing. The period began in 478 BC, after the defeat of the Persian invasion, when an Athenian-led coalition of city-states, known as the Delian League, confronted the Persians to keep the liberated Asian Greek cities free.

After peace was made with Persia in the mid-5th century BC, what started as an alliance of independent city-states became an Athenian empire after Athens abandoned the pretense of parity among its allies and relocated the Delian League treasury from Delos to Athens, where it funded the building of the Athenian Acropolis, put half its population on the public payroll, and maintained its position as the dominant naval power in the Greek world.

With the empire&#x27;s funds, military dominance and its political fortunes guided by statesman and orator Pericles, Athens produced some of the most influential and enduring cultural artifacts of the Western tradition. The playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides all lived and worked in 5th-century BC Athens, as did the historians Herodotus and Thucydides, the physician Hippocrates and the philosophers Plato and Socrates. Athens&#x27;s patron goddess was Athena, from whom it derived the name.

==Overview==
During the golden age, Athenian military and external affairs were mostly entrusted to the ten generals who were elected each year by the ten tribes of citizens, who could be relied on rather than the variable-quality magistrates chosen by lot under the democracy. These &quot;strategoi&quot; were given duties which included planning military expeditions, receiving envoys of other states and directing diplomatic affairs. During the time of the ascendancy of Ephialtes as leader of the democratic faction, Pericles was his deputy. When Ephialtes was assassinated for overthrowing the elitist Council of the Aeropagus, Pericles stepped in and was elected in 445 BC, a post he held continuously until his death in 429 BC, always by election of the Athenian Assembly. 

Pericles was a great speaker; this quality brought him tremendous success in the Assembly, presenting his vision of politics. One of his most popular reforms was to allow thetes (Athenians without wealth) to occupy public office. Another success of his administration was the creation of the misthophoria (, which literally means &quot;paid function&quot;), a special salary for the citizens that attended the courts as jurors. This way, these citizens were able to dedicate themselves to public service without facing financial hardship. With this system, Pericles succeeded in keeping the courts full of jurors (Ath. Pol. 27.3), and in giving the people experience in public life. As Athens&#x27; ruler, he made the city the first and most important &quot;polis&quot; of the Greek world, acquiring a resplendent culture and democratic institutions.

The sovereign people governed themselves, without intermediaries, deciding matters of state in the Assembly. Athenian citizens were free and only owed obedience to their laws and respect to their gods. They achieved equality of speech in the Assembly: &quot;the word of a poor person had the same worth as that of a rich person&quot;. The censorial classes did not disappear, but their power was more limited; they shared the fiscal and military offices but they did not have the power of distributing privileges.

The principle of equality granted to all citizens had dangers since many citizens were incapable of exercising political rights due to their extreme poverty or ignorance. To avoid this, Athenian democracy applied itself to the task of helping the poorest in this manner:

*Concession of salaries to public functionaries.
*To seek and supply work to the poor.
*To grant lands to dispossessed villagers.
*Public assistance for war widows, invalids, orphans and indigents.
*Other social help.

Most importantly, and in order to emphasize the concept of equality and discourage corruption and patronage, practically all public offices that did not require a particular expertise were appointed by lot and not by election. Among those selected by lot to a political body, specific office was always rotated so that every single member served in all capacities in turn. This was meant to ensure that political functions were instituted in such a way as to run smoothly, regardless of each official&#x27;s individual capacity.

These measures appear to have been carried out in great measure since the testimony has come to us from (among others) the Greek historian Thucydides (c. 460–400 BC), who comments: &quot;Everyone who is capable of serving the city meets no impediment, neither poverty, nor civic condition...&quot;

==Institutions==

===The magistrates===
The magistrates were people who occupied a public post and formed the administration of the Athenian state. They were submitted to rigorous public control. The magistrates were chosen by lot, using fava beans. Black and white beans were put in a box and depending on which color the person drew out they obtained the post or not. This was a way of eliminating the personal influence of rich people and possible intrigues and use of favors. There were only two categories of posts not chosen by lot, but by election in the Popular Assembly. These were &quot;strategoi&quot;, or general, and magistrate of finance. It was generally supposed that significant qualities were needed to exercise each of those two offices. A magistrate&#x27;s post did not last more than a year, including that of the &quot;strategos&quot; and in this sense the continued selection of Pericles year after year was an exception. At the end of every year, a magistrate would have to give an account of his administration and use of public finances.

The most honored posts were the ancient &quot;archontes&quot;, or archons in English. In previous ages they had been the heads of the Athenian state, but in the Age of Pericles they lost their influence and power, although they still presided over tribunals.

Every year the citizens elected ten &quot;strategoi&quot; (singular &quot;strategos&quot;), or generals, who served as both military officers and diplomats. It was through this position that Pericles shaped 5th-century BC Athens.

There were also more than forty public administration officers and more than sixty to police the streets, the markets, to check weights and measures and to carry out arrests and executions.

===The Assembly of the People===
The Assembly (in Greek, , that is to say, an assembly by summons), was the first organ of the democracy. In theory it brought together in assembly all the citizens of Athens, however the maximum number which came to congregate is estimated at 6,000 participants. The gathering place was a space on the hill called Pnyx, in front of the Acropolis. The sessions sometimes lasted from dawn to dusk. The ecclesia occurred forty times a year.

The Assembly decided on laws and decrees which were proposed. Decisions relied on ancient laws that had long been in force. Bills were voted on in two stages: first the Assembly itself decided and afterwards the Council or βουλή gave definitive approval.

===The Council or Boule===
The Council or Boule () consisted of 500 members, fifty from each tribe, functioning as an extension of the Assembly. These were chosen by chance, using the system described earlier, from which they were familiarly known as &quot;councillors of the bean&quot;; officially they were known as &quot;prytaneis&quot; (, meaning &quot;chief&quot; or &quot;teacher&quot;).

The council members examined and studied legal projects, supervised the magistrates and saw that daily administrative details were on the right path. They oversaw the city state&#x27;s external affairs. They also met at Pnyx hill, in a place expressly prepared for the event. The fifty prytaneis in power were located on grandstands carved into the rock. They had stone platforms which they reached by means of a small staircase of three steps. On the first platform were the secretaries and scribes; the orator would climb up to the second. Any one who became unpopular would be kicked out and would be brought to another city.

==Finances==

The economic resources of the Athenian State would not have been possible without the treasury of the Delian League. The treasury was originally held on the island of Delos, but Pericles moved it to Athens under the pretext that Delos wasn&#x27;t safe enough. This resulted in internal friction within the league and the rebellion of some city-states that were members. Athens retaliated quickly and some scholars believe this to be the period wherein it would be more appropriate to discuss an Athenian Empire instead of a league.

Other small incomes came from customs fees and fines. In times of war, a special tax was levied on rich citizens. These citizens were also charged permanently with other taxes for the good of the city. This was called the system of liturgy. The taxes were used to maintain the triremes which gave Athens great naval power and to pay and maintain a chorus for large religious festivals. It is believed that rich Athenian men saw it as an honor to sponsor the triremes (probably because they became leaders of it for the period they supported it) or the festivals and they often engaged in competitive donating.

Athens also benefited from a proximity to the trading port of Piraeus. The state of Athens collected a duty on cargo passing through the port. At Piraeus (the main port of Athens), this tax was set at 1% or higher on goods.

==Athens in the Age of Pericles==
The Athenian elite lived modestly and without great luxuries, compared to the elites of other ancient states. There were very few great fortunes and land ownership was not concentrated: 71–73% of the citizen population owned 60–65% of the land, whereas the Gini coefficient for citizen population has been calculated as 0.708. The economy was based on maritime commerce and manufacturing, according to Amemiya&#x27;s estimates, 56% of Athens&#x27; GDP was derived from manufacturing. Agriculture was also important, but it did not produce enough to feed the populace, so most food had to be imported (it is estimated that the carrying capacity of Attica&#x27;s soil was between 84,000 and 150,000, while the population was 300,000 to 350,000 in 431 BC).

The state oversaw all the major religious festivals. The most important one was the Panathenaia in honor of the goddess Athena, a ritual procession carried out once a year in May and once every four years in July, in which the town presented a new veil (&quot;peplos&quot;) to the old wooden statue of Athena Poliada. Phidias immortalized this procession in the frieze of the Parthenon, which is currently at the British Museum. In the July Panathenaia (&quot;Great Panathenaia&quot;), large competitions were organized which included gymnastics and horseback riding, the winners of which received amphoras full of sacred olive oil as a prize. The other important festival was the dramatic Dionysia in honour of Dionysus where tragedies and comedies were performed.

===Education===

The education of boys began in their own home up until the age of seven when they had to attend school. There, they had several teachers who taught them to read and write, as well as subjects such as mathematics and music. Boys also had to take part in physical education classes where they were prepared for future military service with activities such as wrestling, racing, jumping and gymnastics. At eighteen they served in the army and were instructed on how to bear arms. Physical education was very intense and many of the boys ended up becoming true athletes. In addition to these compulsory lessons, the students had the chance to discuss and learn from the great philosophers, grammarians and orators of the time. Some poor people had to stay at home and help their parents. However, Aristophanes and Socrates, though they were poor, became famous and successful.

===Women===

The primary role of free women in classical Athens was to marry and bear children. The emphasis on marriage as a way to perpetuate the family through childbearing had changed from archaic Athens, when (at least amongst the powerful) marriages were as much about making beneficial connections as they were about perpetuating the family. Married women were responsible for the day-to-day running of the household. At marriage, they assumed responsibility for the prosperity of their husband&#x27;s household and the health of its members. Their primary responsibilities were bearing, raising and caring for children, weaving cloth and making clothes. They would also have been responsible for caring for ill household members, supervising slaves, and ensuring that the household had sufficient food. In classical Athenian marriages, husband or wife could legally initiate a divorce. The woman&#x27;s closest male relative (who would be her &quot;kyrios&quot; if she were not married) could also do so, apparently even against the couple&#x27;s wishes. After divorce, the husband was required to return the dowry or pay 18 percent interest annually so the woman&#x27;s livelihood would continue and she could remarry. If there were children at the time of the divorce, they remained in their father&#x27;s house and he remained responsible for their upbringing.

In some cases, Athenian women had the same rights and responsibilities as Athenian men. However, Athenian women did have some significant disabilities at law compared to their male counterparts. Like slaves and metics, they were denied political freedom, citizenship and voting rights, being excluded from the law courts and the Assembly. Women ideally remained apart from men. However it was recognised that an ideology of separation could not be practiced by many Athenians. In &quot;Politics&quot;, Aristotle asked: &quot;How is it possible to prevent the wives of the poor from going out of doors?&quot; In practice, only wealthy families would have been able to implement this ideology. Women&#x27;s responsibilities would have forced them to leave the house frequently – to fetch water from the well or wash clothing, for example. Although wealthy families may have had slaves to enable free women to remain in the house, most would not have had enough slaves to prevent free women from leaving at all.

The cult of Athena Polias (the city&#x27;s eponymous goddess) was central to Athenian society, reinforcing morality and maintaining societal structure. Women played a key role in the cult; the priestesshood of Athena was a position of great importance, and the priestess could use her influence to support political positions. According to Herodotus, before the Battle of Salamis the priestess of Athena encouraged the evacuation of Athens by telling the Athenians that the snake sacred to Athena (which lived on the Acropolis) had already left.

==Arts and literature==

Historians consider the Athenian 5th and 6th centuries BC as the Golden Age of sculpture and architecture. In this period the ornamental elements and the technique employed did not vary from the previous period. What characterizes this period is the quantity of works and the refinement and perfection of the works. Most were religious in nature, mainly sanctuaries and temples. Some examples from this period are:

* The reconstruction of the Temple of Olympian Zeus.
* The reconstruction of the Temple of Apollo in Delphi, which was destroyed by an earthquake.
* The reconstruction of the Acropolis of Athens, the marble city for the glory of the gods. The site had suffered from a fire started by the Persians and lay in ruins for more than 30 years. Pericles initiated its reconstruction with white marble brought from the nearby quarry of Pentelicon. The best architects, sculptors and workers were gathered to complete the Acropolis. The construction lasted 20 years. Financing came from the Delian League.

===Sculpture===

Phidias is considered the greatest sculptor of this era. He created colossal gold-plated ivory statues (&quot;chryselephantine statues&quot;), generally face and hands, which were highly celebrated and admired in his own time: Athena, situated in the interior of the Parthenon, whose splendor reached the faithful through the open doors, and Zeus in the Sanctuary of Olympia, considered in its age and in later ages to be one of the marvels of the world.

According to Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;, in order to conserve the marble of these sculptures, oil receptacles were placed in the temples so that the ivory would not crack.

The other great sculptors of this century were Myron and Polycletus.

===Pottery===

During this age, the production of ceramic pieces was abundant. Amphorae were produced in mass quantity due to the heavy trading with other cities all around the Mediterranean. Large evidence of amphorae from this era can be found around every major ancient port as well as in the Aegean sea. During this period is also seen an abundance of white background ceramics which are much more delicate than the previously popular yellow and black background ceramics. These ceramics were often used to keep perfume or for mortuary rites, including decorations on graves. 
It is also known that there were many great painters, but their works are lost, both frescos and free-standing paintings.

===Theatre===

The theatre reached its greatest height in the 5th century BC. Pericles promoted and favored the theatre with a series of practical and economic measures. The wealthiest families were obligated to care for and to sustain the choruses and actors. By this means, Pericles maintained the tradition according to which theatrical performances served the moral and intellectual education of the people. Plays were made by men and usually for men, and this platform was often used to reinforce the patriarchy.

Athens became the great city of Greek theatre. Theatrical performances lasted eight consecutive hours and were performed as part of a competition in which a jury proclaimed a winner. While the decor of the provisional theatres was very simple, the permanent theatrical venues of ancient Athens eventually became more sumptuous and elaborate. No matter the performance venue, plays were performed by, at most, three actors, who wore masks to identify them with the characters they portrayed; they were accompanied by a chorus who sang and danced.

The dramatic poets from this era whose plays have survived are:
*Aeschylus
*Sophocles
*Euripides
*Aristophanes

===Philosophy===

The Golden Age featured some of the most renowned Western philosophers of all time. Chief among these were Socrates, whose ideas exist primarily in a series of dialogues by his student Plato, who mixed them with his own; Plato; and Plato&#x27;s student, Aristotle.

Other notable philosophers of the Golden Age included Anaxagoras; Democritus (who first inquired as to what substance lies within all matter, the earliest known proposal of what is now called the atom or its sub-units); Empedocles; Hippias; Isocrates; Parmenides; Heraclitus; and Protagoras.

In the second half of the 5th century BC the name of sophist (from the Greek &quot;sophistês&quot;, expert, teacher, man of wisdom) was given to the teachers that gave instruction on diverse branches of science and knowledge in exchange for a fee.

In this age, Athens was the &quot;school of Greece.&quot; Pericles and his mistress Aspasia had the opportunity to associate with not only the great Athenians thinkers of their day but also other Greek and foreign scholars. Among them were the philosopher Anaxagoras, the architect Hippodamus of Miletus, who reconstructed Peiraeus, as well as the historians Herodotus (484–425), Thucydides (460–400), and Xenophon (430–354).

Athens was also the capital of eloquence. Since the late 5th century BC, eloquence had been elevated to an art form. There were the logographers () who wrote courses and created a new literary form characterized by the clarity and purity of the language. It became a lucrative profession. It is known that the logographer Lysias (460–380 BC) made a great fortune thanks to his profession. Later, in the 4th century BC, the orators Isocrates and Demosthenes also became famous.

==End of the Age of Pericles==
From 461 until his death in 429 BC Pericles was active in the government of Athens, an era of splendour and a standard of living higher than any previously experienced. All was well within the internal government, however discontent within the Delian League was ever increasing. The foreign affairs policies adopted by Athens did not produce the best results; members of the Delian League were increasingly dissatisfied. Athens was the city-state that dominated and subjugated the rest of Greece and these oppressed citizens wanted their independence.

Previously, in 550 BC, a similar league between the cities of the Peloponnessus—directed and dominated by Sparta—had been founded. Taking advantage of the general dissent of the Greek city-states, this Peloponnesian League began to confront Athens. After a long lasting series of poorly managed, hawkish policies, (c. 431 BC) and the ensuing Peloponnesian War the city of Athens finally lost its independence in 338 BC, when Philip II of Macedonia conquered the rest of Greece.

<text>Priscilla Ann Presley (&quot;née&quot; Wagner, formerly Beaulieu; born May 24, 1945) is an American businesswoman and actress. She is the ex-wife of American singer Elvis Presley, as well as the cofounder and former chairperson of Elvis Presley Enterprises (EPE), the company that turned Graceland into one of the top tourist attractions in the United States. In her acting career, Presley costarred with Leslie Nielsen in the &quot;Naked Gun&quot; film trilogy and played Jenna Wade on the long-running television series &quot;Dallas&quot;.

==Early life==
Priscilla Ann Wagner was born at Brooklyn Naval Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, on May 24, 1945. Her maternal grandfather, Albert Henry Iversen, was born in Egersund, Norway. He migrated to the United States, where he married Lorraine Davis, who was of Scots-Irish and English descent. Their only daughter was Anna Lillian Iversen, whose name was later shortened to Ann. Presley&#x27;s biological father was US Navy pilot James Frederick Wagner, son of Kathryn and Harold Wagner of Cherrytree Township, Pennsylvania. He married Ann on August 10, 1944, after dating for more than three years. Wagner died in a plane crash on November 3, 1945. Presley&#x27;s paternal uncle, Harold Wagner Jr., served as principal of an American school in Fürstenfeldbruck, Germany.
In 1948, Ann married United States Air Force officer Paul Beaulieu, from Québec, Canada. The couple raised Priscilla, along with half-siblings Donald, Michelle, Jeffrey and twins Thomas and Timothy Beaulieu. Priscilla&#x27;s surname was legally changed from Wagner to Beaulieu on April 17, 1950. Over the next few years, the growing family repeatedly relocated as her stepfather&#x27;s Air Force career moved them from Connecticut to New Mexico to Maine. Priscilla describes herself during this period as &quot;a shy, pretty, little girl, unhappily accustomed to moving from base to base every two or three years&quot;. Presley would later recall how uneasy she felt about having to move so often, never knowing if she could ever make friends for life or if she would fit in with the people she would meet at the next place.
In 1956, the family settled in Del Valle, Texas, but soon Beaulieu was transferred to Wiesbaden, West Germany. Priscilla was &quot;crushed&quot; upon learning this news, as it occurred just after her junior high school years, and was upset about leaving her friends and connections behind.

==Life in West Germany==
When the Beaulieus arrived in West Germany, they stayed at the Helene Hotel, but living at the hotel soon became too large a financial burden to sustain. After three months living at the hotel, the Beaulieus sought another home to rent. The family settled into a large apartment in a &quot;vintage building constructed long before World War I.&quot; Soon after moving in, the Beaulieus realized the building operated as a brothel, but given the scarcity of housing, they had little choice but to remain.

== Life with Elvis ==
===West Germany===
On September 13, 1959, 14-year-old Priscilla met 24-year-old Elvis at a party at his villa in Bad Nauheim, West Germany, which he had rented during his military service. Her presence is said to have made Elvis seem &quot;awkward&quot; and &quot;embarrassed&quot;; however, he composed himself by the end of the evening. Priscilla&#x27;s late return home on the night of that first meeting upset her parents, who insisted that she never see Elvis again. However, his eagerness for another rendezvous and his promise to never bring her home late again led Priscilla&#x27;s parents to relent. Thereafter, Priscilla and Elvis were frequently together until his departure from West Germany on March 2, 1960.

After Elvis left, Priscilla was inundated with requests for interviews from media outlets around the world. Priscilla received fan mail from Elvis fans, some positive and some negative, as well as mail from &quot;lonesome G.I.s&quot;. With gossip-magazine rumors swirling about Presley&#x27;s relationship with Nancy Sinatra, Priscilla became convinced that her romance with Elvis was over, and she was concerned she would never see him again. Priscilla was also concerned about Elvis rekindling his relationship with Anita Wood, whom he had been dating before and after his overseas service in West Germany.

According to biographer Suzanne Finstad, while Priscilla was separated from Elvis, she dated boys her own age at her high school in West Germany such as Ron Tapp and Jamie Lindbergh, and attended school dances with them.

===Move to Graceland===

After Elvis&#x27;s return to the US, Priscilla managed to stay in touch with him by phone, though they did not see each other again until the summer of 1962, when Priscilla&#x27;s parents agreed to let her visit for two weeks. They allowed her to go, on the condition Elvis pay for a first-class round trip ticket and arrange for her to be chaperoned at all times. She was also expected to write to her parents every day. Elvis agreed to all these demands, and Priscilla flew to Los Angeles. Elvis told her they were going to Las Vegas, and to confuse her parents, he had Priscilla write a postcard for every day they would be away, with the intent that each would be mailed daily from Los Angeles by a member of his staff.

It was during this visit, while on a trip to Las Vegas, that Priscilla first experimented with amphetamines and sleeping pills to keep up with Elvis&#x27;s lifestyle. After another visit at Christmas, Priscilla&#x27;s parents let her move to Memphis for good in mid-March 1963, two months before her 18th birthday. Part of the agreement was that they would eventually marry. She would finish her senior year at an all-girls Catholic school, the Immaculate Conception High School, and live with Elvis&#x27;s father and stepmother in a separate house, a few streets away from the Graceland mansion at 3650 Hermitage Drive, until she graduated in May. However, according to her 1985 autobiography, &quot;Elvis and Me&quot;, she &quot;spent entire nights with Grandma [Elvis&#x27;s grandmother, Minnie Mae Presley] at Graceland and gradually moved [her] belongings there.&quot; It is believed she had her permanent residence at Graceland as early as May 1963. Her parents eventually agreed to her living there, on the condition that Elvis promise to marry her. Priscilla later said, &quot;The move was natural. ... I was there all the time anyway.&quot;

Priscilla was keen to go to Hollywood with Elvis, but he kept telling her he was too busy and had her stay in Memphis. During that period, Priscilla read reports about an affair between Elvis and his &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; co-star Ann-Margret. Priscilla confronted Elvis, who explained the reports as rumors to promote the film, urging her to not trust the press. Over the next few years, Elvis had numerous intimate relationships with his co-stars, but denied each of them to Priscilla. Eventually, she was allowed to visit him in Hollywood, but her visits were kept short.

===Marriage and pregnancy===

Shortly before Christmas 1966, Elvis proposed to Priscilla, after being reminded of the record contract&#x27;s RCA &quot;morals clause&quot; by his manager, Colonel Tom Parker. Priscilla suggested, in a 1973 interview with &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal,&quot; that she and Elvis were quite happy to just live together, but &quot;at that time, it wasn&#x27;t nice for people to [just] live together&quot;. According to his cook, Alberta, and friend, Marty Lacker, Elvis was reluctant to marry and upset about not having a choice. Others, such as Joe Esposito, have asserted that Elvis was excited to marry Priscilla.

In her book &quot;Elvis and Me&quot;, Priscilla described Elvis as a very passionate man. According to her account, the singer told her that they had to wait until they were married before having intercourse. He said, &quot;I&#x27;m not saying we can&#x27;t do other things. It&#x27;s just the actual encounter. I want to save it.&quot; Priscilla said in her autobiography that she was a virgin when she married, and she and Elvis did not have sex until their wedding night. However, this claim is questioned by biographer Suzanne Finstad who claimed that Priscilla had intercourse with Elvis in Germany as well as her teenage boyfriends. 

The couple married on May 1, 1967, at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas. The wedding, arranged by Parker to maximize publicity, featured very few guests and was over in only eight minutes. It was followed by a quick press conference and a $10,000 breakfast reception, attended by friends, family, and business associates from MGM, RCA, and the William Morris Agency. The wedding caused rifts between Elvis and several of his closest friends, including Red West, who were not invited to the actual wedding ceremony. Although the blame mainly fell on Parker, resentment was held for years to follow.

Following the reception, Priscilla and Elvis boarded a private jet and enjoyed a short honeymoon in Palm Springs. On May 4, they flew back to Memphis and retreated to their private ranch, just over the Mississippi state line, for a three-week break. Many of Elvis&#x27;s inner circle joined them, although for the most part, the couple were left alone and were able to enjoy each other&#x27;s company, without the intrusion of the Memphis Mafia. &quot;I loved playing house,&quot; she later remarked, adding, &quot;Here was an opportunity to take care of him myself. No maids or housekeepers to pamper us.&quot; In an attempt to heal rifts, Elvis and Priscilla held another reception at Graceland on May 29 for the friends and family who were unable to attend the original ceremonies.

Soon after, Priscilla found out that she was pregnant. She was upset at such an early pregnancy, certain that it would destroy the closeness she had finally found with Elvis. She had asked him earlier if she could take birth control pills, but Elvis had insisted they were not perfected yet. She considered an abortion and had even discussed it with Elvis, but both decided they could not live with themselves if they had gone through with it. Their only child, Lisa Marie, was born exactly nine months after their wedding, on February 1, 1968.

===Separation and divorce===
Priscilla wrote, in &quot;Elvis and Me,&quot; that she began taking private dance lessons around the time her husband was filming &quot;Live a Little, Love a Little&quot; (1968). She found herself deeply attracted to the instructor, known simply as Mark in the book, where she confesses to having a short affair. She implies regret, however, stating, &quot;I came out of it realizing I needed much more out of my relationship with Elvis&quot;.

Despite Priscilla&#x27;s affair and Elvis&#x27;s on-and-off affairs with his co-stars, the first few years they were married seemed a happy time for the couple. However, when Elvis&#x27;s career took off again following his 1968 television special, he was constantly touring and playing in Las Vegas and having affairs, while Priscilla stayed at home to care for their daughter.
Priscilla took up karate after Elvis, a keen karate student, convinced her to do so. Priscilla, eager to share her husband&#x27;s interests, thought it was a good idea to pass the time she spent alone. Following disruptions from Elvis, Priscilla began taking lessons from Mike Stone, a karate instructor she met in 1972 at one of Elvis&#x27;s concerts backstage. She soon began an affair with him, stating that, &quot;I still loved Elvis, greatly, but over the next few months, I knew I would have to make a crucial decision regarding my destiny&quot;. She later states, &quot;Elvis must have perceived my new restlessness.&quot; A couple of months later, she said that Elvis had requested to see her in his hotel suite. It was there, according to her autobiography, that Elvis &quot;forcefully made love to me...[as he said] &#x27;This is how a real man makes love to his woman&#x27;&quot;.

In a later interview, Priscilla said that she regretted her choice of words in describing his actions, and she said it had been an overstatement. She went on to say, following the incident, &quot;what really hurt was that he was not sensitive to me, as a woman, and his attempt at reconciliation had come too late,&quot; suggesting that his actions were a deliberate attempt at reconciliation or compensation for his lack of sexual interest in Priscilla, which had been a source of hurt and discontent for her for years. Priscilla stated in her book, &quot;He had mentioned to me, before we were married, that he had never been able to make love to a woman who had a child,&quot; and she later expressed the personal repercussions of their sexual dysfunction, saying, &quot;I am beginning to doubt my own sexuality, as a woman. My physical and emotional needs were unfulfilled.&quot; After this incident, Priscilla summarized, &quot;this was not the gentle, understanding man I grew to love&quot;. Many years later on the British talk show Loose Women, Priscilla said she and Elvis did sleep together after their daughter Lisa Marie was born.

Priscilla and Elvis separated on February 24, 1972, and the two filed for legal separation on July 26. To avoid Priscilla having to make her home address available on public records, risking the security of her and Lisa Marie, Elvis filed for divorce on his 38th birthday, January 8, 1973. Later that month, Elvis reportedly became paranoid about Mike Stone and said, &quot;There&#x27;s too much pain in me... Stone [must] die.&quot; His intense outbursts continued, unable to be calmed by a physician and large doses of medication. He did not accept offers by his bodyguard to arrange a contract killing. The divorce was finalized on October 9, 1973.

The couple agreed to share custody of their daughter, and Priscilla was awarded an outright cash payment of US$725,000, as well as spousal support, child support, 5% of Elvis&#x27;s new publishing companies, and half the proceeds from the sale of their Beverly Hills home. Originally, the couple had agreed upon a much smaller settlement: a $100,000 lump payment, $1,000 a month in spousal support, and $500 a month in child support. Priscilla was keen to make it on her own and prove that her marriage to Elvis was not about money. After consulting her new lawyers, her demands increased, pointing out that a star of Elvis&#x27;s stature could easily afford more for his former wife and child. Priscilla and Elvis remained close, leaving the courthouse hand-in-hand on the day their divorce was finalized.

== Personal life post-1973 ==

Though she has never remarried, Priscilla has had numerous romantic relationships since her divorce from Elvis. Immediately afterwards, she lived with karate instructor Mike Stone; they broke up in 1975. She then dated actor Peter Lawford, photographer Terry O&#x27;Neill, lawyer Robert Kardashian, hairdresser Elie Ezerzer, and financiers Morgan Maxfield and Kirk Kerkorian.

Beginning in 1978, Presley had a six-year intermittent live-in relationship with model Michael Edwards, until he allegedly began abusing teenage Lisa Marie. Lisa Marie was aged 10 to 16 during his relationship with her mother. Edwards recounts the tale of their relationship in his book &quot;Priscilla, Elvis, and Me&quot; (1988), which discloses her liaisons with Julio Iglesias and Richard Gere in the early 1980s. Lisa Marie stated in a 2003 Playboy interview and in her memoir &quot;From Here to the Great Unknown&quot; that Edwards was sexually inappropriate with her throughout Priscilla&#x27;s relationship with him, alleging that he began sexually molesting her in 1978, when she was 10.

Presley&#x27;s longest relationship has been with Brazilian screenwriter-turned-computer-programmer Marco Antonio Garcia (a.k.a. Marco Garibaldi), with whom she lived for 22 years. The two were introduced by costumer Kathy Monderine in 1984 after he wrote a script that she read, hoping to produce. Their son, musician Navarone Garibaldi, was born on March 1, 1987. (Presley was starring in the primetime soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot; at the time and her pregnancy was written into the storyline.) In 2006, they ended their relationship. At the beginning of their romance, Presley ensured Garibaldi sign a promissory agreement that if they should break up, he would not write a book about her.

Between 2006 and 2009, Presley dated British TV executive Nigel Lythgoe. In the early 2010s she was linked to restaurateur Richie Palmer, ex-husband of Raquel Welch, as well as Australian entertainer Barry Crocker and disc jockey Toby Anstis.

Priscilla and Tom Jones have maintained a friendship ever since Jones became friends with Elvis in 1965. Since the friendship started, rumours have occasionally surfaced that the two are dating, which Jones has denied.

Through her daughter, Lisa Marie, Presley has four grandchildren including actress Riley Keough. Presley became a great-grandmother through Riley Keough in 2022. Her daughter, Lisa Marie, died after suffering cardiac arrest and complications of bariatric surgery on January 12, 2023, at age 54.

== Business ==
In 1973, following her separation from her husband, Presley set up a clothing boutique in Los Angeles called Bis &amp; Beau with her friend and stylist Olivia Bis. In a 1973 interview to promote the opening of the store, Priscilla said, &quot;After the separation, I had to make up my mind about what I wanted to do, and since I had worked with Olivia for such a long time on my own clothes, I decided to try it professionally. We both do the designing for the shop, and have people who sew for us.&quot; Elvis, supportive of Priscilla&#x27;s business, contacted several friends in public relations to help promote the launch. The shop was a successful business venture, with celebrity clients including Diana Ross, Carol Burnett, Jill Ireland, Mary Tyler Moore, Victoria Principal, Michelle Phillips, Dyan Cannon, Julie Christie, Suzanne Pleshette, Cher, Liza Minnelli, Lana Turner, Barbra Streisand, and Natalie Wood shopping there regularly. The shop closed in 1976.

After Elvis&#x27;s death in 1977, his father Vernon was one of the executors of his estate, which was held in trust for his daughter Lisa Marie. Vernon named Priscilla to be his successor upon his death. She assumed the role following Vernon&#x27;s 1979 death. Graceland itself cost $500,000 a year in upkeep, and expenses had dwindled Lisa Marie&#x27;s inheritance to only $1 million. Taxes due on the property and other expenses due came to over $500,000. Faced with having to sell Graceland, Presley examined other public homes and museums. She hired a CEO, Jack Soden, to turn Graceland into a tourist attraction. Graceland was opened to the public on June 7, 1982. Only four weeks after opening Graceland&#x27;s doors, the estate made back all the money it had invested. Priscilla became the chairperson and president of Elvis Presley Enterprises (EPE), stating that she would remain in the position until Lisa Marie reached 21 years of age. Under Priscilla Presley&#x27;s guidance, the enterprise&#x27;s fortunes soared and eventually the trust grew to be worth over $100 million.

In 1988, Presley launched her own fragrance, Moments, and followed this up with a range of best-selling perfumes in the 1990s – Experiences in 1993, Indian Summer in 1996, and Roses and More in 1998. She has also successfully sold her line of products live on the Home Shopping Network and was coached by veteran HSN host Bob Circosta.

In 2006, Presley flew to Sydney, Australia for the debut of her worldwide line of bed linens called the Priscilla Presley Collection. She partnered with Australian designer Bruno Schiavi for the line.

She has helped to produce feature films including &quot;Breakfast with Einstein&quot; and &quot;Finding Graceland&quot;. In September 2000, Presley was elected to the board of directors at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. In 2015 Presley became the executive producer of a 14-track album titled &quot;If I Can Dream: Elvis Presley With the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra&quot;. She said, &quot;If Elvis were here, he would be evolving and taking risks, seemingly like everybody else today&quot;. Also in that year the U.S. Postmaster General Megan Brennan and Priscilla Presley dedicated an Elvis &quot;forever&quot; stamp, which featured a 1955 black-and-white image shot by photographer William Speer. It was Priscilla&#x27;s second dedication of a USPS stamp honoring her ex-husband. The first Elvis stamp, issued in 1993, were the most popular stamps sold in the Postal Service&#x27;s history. This second contribution also made Elvis Presley the first musical artist to be featured in two different issues of its commemorative stamps collections.

On August 16, 2019, it was announced that Presley, in conjunction with John Eddie, as well as Sony Pictures, would create and produce &quot;Agent Elvis&quot;, a Netflix adult animated fictional series about her former husband working as a spy by night while remaining a musician during the day. The series&#x27; first teaser was published on the official Elvis Instagram account on June 15, 2022. The image showed an illustrated Elvis donning a black trench coat. Presley was featured as a cast member in the show, voicing her own animation character.

==Acting career==

Presley had shown an interest in dancing and modelling and had modeled for a local store once. Hal B. Wallis, a Hollywood producer who had financed many of Elvis&#x27;s earlier films, showed interest in signing Priscilla to a contract. However, during her marriage she never pursued these activities as a career, instead calling acting or filmmaking a &quot;hobby&quot;. Priscilla was sensitive about Elvis&#x27;s opinion, because he did not want to let Priscilla have her own career, repeating the then-popular saying, &quot;A woman&#x27;s place is in the home looking after her man&quot;. Priscilla neither pursued fashion modelling nor did she sign any exclusive contracts, instead choosing to comply with her husband&#x27;s wishes.

Presley had originally been offered a role as one of the leads on &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. She turned down the role because she disliked the show. Presley made her television debut as co-host of &quot;Those Amazing Animals&quot; in 1980. In 1983, she had her first professional acting role on a season 2 episode of &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; titled &quot;Manhunter&quot;. She then went on to play in a television film titled &quot;Love is Forever&quot;, starring alongside Michael Landon. Although she was treated well by most of the cast and crew, and her acting was praised by several of her co-stars, she found Landon difficult to work with on set. After the television film aired, Presley took on the role of Jenna Wade in the primetime soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot;. As the third actor to portray Jenna (after Morgan Fairchild and Francine Tacker), she played the role for the longest of the three after the character was expanded and Presley became a series regular. In 1988, after five years, Presley left the show. During her tenure on the series, she was also offered the role of Bond girl Stacey Sutton in &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985), but she had to decline the role due to scheduling conflicts. The role ultimately went to former &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; star Tanya Roberts.

In 1988, Presley starred opposite Leslie Nielsen in &quot;The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&quot; as Jane Spencer. Critic Roger Ebert praised Presley&#x27;s performance, saying her &quot;light comic touch&quot; helped balance out the film&#x27;s more over-the-top humor. She would go on to act in the next two movies in the series: &quot;The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear&quot; (1991) and &quot;Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult&quot; (1994). All three films performed solidly at the box office. In between, she acted in &quot;The Adventures of Ford Fairlane&quot; (1990) with Andrew Dice Clay. During the mid-to-late-1990s she made guest appearances on the hit television shows &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, and &quot;Spin City&quot;.

Presley made her pantomime debut in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; at the New Wimbledon Theatre, Wimbledon, London, during Christmas of 2012, starring opposite Warwick Davis. She reprised her role of the Wicked Queen at the Manchester Opera House in 2014.

&quot;Priscilla&quot; is the biopic focusing on her relationship with Elvis, which was directed by Sofia Coppola.

==Charity work and activism==

Since 2003, Presley has been the Ambassador of the Dream Foundation, a Santa Barbara-based wish-granting organization for terminally ill adults and their families.

Priscilla Presley joined the Church of Scientology along with her daughter after Elvis&#x27;s death. In 2006, she helped inaugurate Narconon&#x27;s Stonehawk Rehabilitation Center in Michigan. When Lisa Marie left Scientology by 2016, it was reported that Priscilla had also distanced herself from the church at the same time, however, in October 2017 Priscilla Presley&#x27;s representative denied that she had left the church.

In 2013, Presley spoke out against a 2013 agricultural gag law that would have criminalized unauthorized filming or recording on farms. In a letter to Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam she spoke of her and Elvis&#x27;s love of horses and expressed concerns that the bill would hinder animal cruelty investigations and reduce protections for horses and other farm animals.

==Honors==
Presley was conferred the degree of Doctor of Humanities by Rhodes College in 1998. She was named godmother of the largest river steamboat ever built, American Queen, christened April 27, 2012 at its home port in Memphis. The AutoZone Liberty Bowl chose her as its 2018 Distinguished Citizen Award winner. On July 22, 2022, Theatre Memphis honored her contributions to Memphis art and tourism with a gala, &quot;Honoring Priscilla Presley: The Artist, The Woman&quot;, featuring more than a dozen speakers and a live musical tribute. She has a square named after her in Egersund – Priscilla Presleys plass. The area is in the street outside the house where her grandfather was born in 1899, and lived.

== Filmography ==
==Portrayals==

Since 1979, Presley has been portrayed in several screen and TV films focusing on various aspects of her life with Elvis Presley, her husband from 1967 to 1973.

<text>A stoa (; plural, stoas, stoai, or stoae ), in ancient Greek architecture, is a covered walkway or portico, commonly for public use. Early stoas were open at the entrance with columns, usually of the Doric order, lining the side of the building; they created a safe, enveloping, protective atmosphere.

This, an &quot;open-fronted shelter with a lean-to roof&quot;, is the meaning in modern usage, but in fact the ancient Greeks &quot;made no clear distinction in their speech&quot; between these and large enclosed rooms with similar functions. 

Later examples were built as two storeys, and incorporated inner colonnades usually in the Ionic style, where shops or sometimes offices were located. These buildings were open to the public; merchants could sell their goods, artists could display their artwork, and religious gatherings could take place. Stoas usually surrounded the marketplaces or agora of large cities and were used as a framing device.

Other examples were designed to create safe, protective atmospheres which combined useful inside and outside space. The name of the Stoic school of philosophy derives from &quot;stoa&quot;.

<doc id="208586" wikidata="Q263254" url="?curid=208586" title="Marie Corelli">
<text>Mary Mackay (1 May 185521 April 1924), also called Minnie Mackey and known by her pseudonym Marie Corelli (, , ), was an English novelist.

From the appearance of her first novel &quot;A Romance of Two Worlds&quot; in 1886, she became a bestselling fiction-writer, her works were largely concerned with Christianity, reincarnation, astral projection and mysticism. Yet despite her many distinguished patrons, she was often ridiculed by critics. Corelli lived her later years in Stratford-upon-Avon, whose historic buildings she fought hard to preserve.

==Life and writings==
===Early life===
Mary Mills was born in London to Mary Elizabeth Mills, a servant of the Scottish poet and songwriter Dr Charles Mackay, her biological father, who was married to another woman at the time of young Mary&#x27;s conception. After his first wife died, he married Mary Elizabeth, whereupon their daughter Mary took the &quot;Mackay&quot; surname. For the rest of her life, Mary / Marie would attempt to conceal her illegitimacy, and to that end disseminated a number of romantic falsehoods about her parentage and upbringing, including stories of adoption or descent from the Italian nobility. Her unreliability as a narrator complicates the task of reconstructing her biography. Recent research suggests that Corelli may even have been adopted by Mackay and Mills from another family, the Codys.

In 1866, eleven-year-old Mary was sent to a Parisian convent (or in some accounts, an English school staffed by nuns) to further her education. She returned home four years later in 1870.

===Career===
Mackay began her career as a musician, giving piano recitals and adopting the name Marie Corelli for her billing. Eventually she turned to writing and published her first novel, &quot;A Romance of Two Worlds&quot;, in 1886. In her time, she was the most widely read author of fiction. Her works were collected by Winston Churchill, Randolph Churchill, and members of the British Royal Family, among others. Yet although sales of Corelli&#x27;s novels exceeded the combined sales of popular contemporaries, including Arthur Conan Doyle, H. G. Wells, and Rudyard Kipling, critics often derided her work as &quot;the favourite of the common multitude&quot;.

She faced criticism from the literary elite for her allegedly melodramatic writing. In &quot;The Spectator&quot;, Grant Allen called her &quot;a woman of deplorable talent who imagined that she was a genius, and was accepted as a genius by a public to whose commonplace sentimentalities and prejudices she gave a glamorous setting.&quot; James Agate represented her as combining &quot;the imagination of a Poe with the style of an Ouida and the mentality of a nursemaid.&quot;

A recurring theme in Corelli&#x27;s books is her attempt to reconcile Christianity with reincarnation, astral projection, and other mystical ideas. She was associated at some point with the Fraternitas Rosae Crucis; a Rosicrucian and mystical organization, and her books were a part of the foundation of today&#x27;s corpus of esoteric philosophy. Her portrait was painted by Helen Donald-Smith.

Corelli famously had little time for the press. In 1902 she wrote to the editor of &quot;The Gentlewoman&quot; to complain that her name had been left out of a list of the guests in the Royal Enclosure at the Braemar Highland Gathering, saying she suspected this had been done intentionally. The editor replied that her name had indeed been left out intentionally, because of her own stated contempt for the press and for the snobbery of those wishing to appear in &quot;news puffs&quot; of society events. Both letters were published in full in the next issue.

The writer also gained some fame after her letter on the curse of the Pharaohs to &quot;New York World&quot; was published. Corelli claimed that she had warned George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon (one of the finders of the tomb of Tutankhamun) about the &quot;dire punishment&quot; likely to occur to those who rifle Egyptian tombs, claiming to cite an ancient book that indicated that poisons had been left after burials.

===Personal life===
Corelli spent her final years in Stratford-upon-Avon. There she fought hard for the preservation of Stratford&#x27;s 17th-century buildings, and donated money to help their owners remove the plaster or brickwork that often covered their original timber-framed façades. Novelist Barbara Comyns Carr mentions Corelli&#x27;s guest appearance at an exhibition of Anglo-Saxon items found at Bidford-on-Avon in 1923. Corelli&#x27;s eccentricity became well known. She would boat on the Avon in a gondola, complete with a gondolier, whom she had brought over from Venice. In his autobiography, Mark Twain, who had a deep dislike of Corelli, describes visiting her in Stratford and how the meeting changed his perception.
For over forty years, Corelli lived with her companion, Bertha Vyver, to whom she left everything when she died. She did not identify herself as a lesbian, but several biographers and critics have noted the frequent erotic descriptions of female beauty that appear in her novels, although they are expressed by men.

Corelli was known to have expressed a genuine passion for the artist Arthur Severn, to whom she wrote daily letters from 1906 to 1917. Severn was the son of Joseph Severn and close friend of John Ruskin. In 1910, she and Severn collaborated on &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Motor&quot;, with Severn providing illustrations for Corelli&#x27;s story. Her love for the long-married painter, her only known romantic attachment to a man, remained unrequited; in fact Severn often belittled Corelli&#x27;s success.

During the First World War, Corelli&#x27;s personal reputation suffered when she was convicted of food hoarding.

She died in Stratford and is buried there in the Evesham Road cemetery. Later Bertha Vyver was buried alongside her.

==Public image==

Corelli was known to fabricate or exaggerate many details of her life. For example, she consistently claimed (in public and in private) that she had been seventeen years old when her first novel, &quot;A Romance of Two Worlds&quot;, was published in 1886, putting her year of birth at 1868 or 1869. This was repeated in contemporary biographies, though it is now believed that she was born in 1855. When she assumed the name &quot;Marie Corelli&quot; at the beginning of her career, she also took on a false backstory, writing to her first publisher, George Bentley, &quot;I am Venetian and can trace myself back to the famous musician Arcangelo Corelli&quot;, and on other occasions claimed to descend from the Doges of Venice.

Corelli avoided being seen in public, and according to biographer Brian Masters, was possessed of a &quot;positive terror of being photographed&quot;. She finally allowed a photograph of herself to be published as the frontispiece of her 1906 novel &quot;Treasure of Heaven&quot;, though it was apparently airbrushed to depict her as &quot;a sweet young lady in her early twenties&quot;. Around the same time, Mark Twain wrote the following description of Corelli&#x27;s appearance in his diary during a visit to Stratford:

She is about fifty years old but has no grey hairs; she is fat and shapeless; she has a gross animal face; she dresses for sixteen, and awkwardly and unsuccessfully and pathetically imitates the innocent graces and witcheries of that dearest and sweetest of all ages...

==Legacy==
Corelli is generally accepted to have been the inspiration for at least two of E. F. Benson&#x27;s characters in his Lucia series of six novels and a short story.

A modern critic has written that Corelli was probably also the inspiration for &quot;Rita&#x27;s&quot; (Eliza Humphreys&#x27;s) main character in &quot;Diana of the Ephesians&quot;, which was published a year before E. F. Benson&#x27;s first Lucia novel, and had been rejected by Hutchinson, which later published the &quot;Lucia&quot; Lucas novels.

In Chapter III of Bruce Marshall&#x27;s &quot;The World, the Flesh and Father Smith&quot;, the protagonist – a Catholic priest – is in hospital, recovering from a wound. A nurse gives him a copy of Marie Corelli&#x27;s &quot;Temporal Power&quot;, with the hope that the book would convert him to Protestantism. However, Father Smith finds the book &quot;stupid and flamboyant&quot;, puts it aside and prays for Corelli, since &quot;she really ought to have known better&quot;.

In 2007, the British film &quot;Angel&quot;, based on a book by Elizabeth Taylor, was released as a thinly-veiled biography of Corelli. The film starred Romola Garai in the Corelli role and also starred Sam Neill and Charlotte Rampling. It was directed by François Ozon, who stated, &quot;The character of Angel was inspired by Marie Corelli, a contemporary of Oscar Wilde and Queen Victoria&#x27;s favourite writer. Corelli was one of the first writers to become a star, writing bestsellers for an adoring public. Today she has been largely forgotten, even in England.&quot;

<text>Charles Matthew &quot;Chuck&quot; Geschke (September 11, 1939 – April 16, 2021) was an American businessman and computer scientist best known for founding the graphics and publishing software company Adobe Inc. with John Warnock in 1982, with whom he also co-created the PDF document format.

== Early life and education ==
Charles Matthew Geschke was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on September 11, 1939. He attended Saint Ignatius High School.

Geschke earned an AB in classics in 1962 and an MS in mathematics in 1963, both from Xavier University. He taught mathematics at John Carroll University from 1963 to 1968. In 1972, he completed his PhD studies in computer science at Carnegie Mellon University under the advice of William Wulf. He was a co-author of Wulf&#x27;s 1975 book &quot;The Design of an Optimizing Compiler&quot;.

== Career ==
Geschke started working at Xerox&#x27;s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in October 1972. His first project was to build a mainframe computer. Afterward, he worked on programming languages and developed tools that were used to build the Xerox Star workstation.

In 1978, Geschke started the Imaging Sciences Laboratory at PARC, and conducted research in the areas of graphics, optics, and image processing. He hired John Warnock, and together they developed Interpress, a page description language (PDL) that could describe forms as complex as typefaces. Unable to convince Xerox management of the commercial value of Interpress, the two left Xerox to start their own company.

Geschke’s interviews are often featured in documentary films produced by the Silicon Valley Historical Association, including the PBS &quot;Silicon Valley, a One Hundred Year Renaissance,&quot; narrated by Walter Cronkite (1998)

=== Adobe ===
Geschke and Warnock founded Adobe in Warnock&#x27;s garage in 1982, naming the company after the Adobe Creek that ran behind Warnock&#x27;s home. Interpress eventually evolved into PostScript. Its use on Apple computers resulted in one of the first desktop publishing (DTP) systems which allowed users to compose documents on a personal computer and see them on screen exactly as they would appear in print, a process known as WYSIWYG, an acronym for What You See Is What You Get. Previously, graphic designers had been forced to view their work in text-only format while they worked, until they printed, or hit &quot;print preview&quot;. Because of the high quality and speed at which printing and composing could be done in WYSIWYG, the innovation &quot;spawned an entire industry&quot; in modern printing and publishing.

From December 1986 until July 1994, Geschke was Adobe&#x27;s Chief Operating Officer, and from April 1989 until April 2000 he was the company&#x27;s president. Geschke retired as president of Adobe in 2000, shortly before his partner Warnock left as CEO. Geschke had also been Co-Chairman of the Board of Adobe from September 1997 to 2017.

Adobe was mentioned in &quot;Forbes 400 Best Big Companies&quot; in 2009, and was ranked 1,069th on the &quot;Forbes Global 2000&quot; list in 2010.

== 1992 kidnapping ==
On the morning of May 26, 1992, as Geschke was arriving for work in Mountain View, California, he was kidnapped at gunpoint from the Adobe parking lot by two men, Mouhannad Albukhari, 26, of San Jose, and Jack Sayeh, 25, of Campbell. A spokesperson for the FBI reported that the agency had monitored phone calls that the kidnappers had made to Geschke&#x27;s wife, demanding a ransom. The spokesperson added that Albukhari had been arrested after he had picked up the $650,000 ransom that Geschke&#x27;s daughter had left at a drop-off point. An FBI agent explained that, &quot;[a]fter a gentlemanly discussion&quot;, Albukhari had brought them to a bungalow in Hollister, where Sayeh had been holding Geschke hostage. Geschke was released unhurt after being held for four days, although he stated that he had been chained. The two kidnappers were eventually sentenced to life terms in state prison.

==Awards==
In 1999, Geschke was inducted as a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).

In 2002, he was made a fellow of the Computer History Museum for &quot;his accomplishments in the commercialization of desktop publishing with John Warnock and for innovations in scalable type, computer graphics and printing.&quot;

In October 2006, Geschke, along with co-founder John Warnock received the annual AeA Medal of Achievement, making them the first software executives to receive this award. In 2008 he received the Computer Entrepreneur Award from the IEEE Computer Society. He also won the 2008 National Medal of Technology and Innovation, awarded by President Barack Obama. On October 15, 2010, the Marconi Society co-awarded Geschke and Warnock the Marconi Prize.

On Sunday, May 20, 2012, Geschke delivered the commencement speech at John Carroll University in University Heights, Ohio, where he had been a mathematics professor early in his career and was awarded an honorary doctorate of Humane Letters.

==Affiliations==
Geschke was on the boards of the San Francisco Symphony, the National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management, the Commonwealth Club of California, Tableau Software, the Egan Maritime Foundation, and the Nantucket Boys and Girls Club. He was also a member of the computer science advisory board at Carnegie Mellon University.

In 1995, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering. In 2008, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2010, he completed his term as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the University of San Francisco. In 2012, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

==Personal life==
Geschke was a Catholic and met his wife Nancy &quot;Nan&quot; McDonough at a religious conference on social action in the spring of 1961. They married in 1964. Both were graduates of Catholic institutions. In 2012 they received the St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Award from the National Catholic Educational Association (NCEA) for their contributions to Catholic education.

Geschke&#x27;s mother was a bankruptcy court paralegal. Both Geschke&#x27;s father and paternal grandfather worked as letterpress photo engravers. Geschke&#x27;s father helped during the early days of Adobe by checking color separation work with his engraver&#x27;s loupe. Geschke described his father&#x27;s acknowledgment of the high quality of the halftone patterns as &quot;a wonderful moment&quot;.

== Death ==
Geschke, a longtime resident of Los Altos, died on April 16, 2021, at the age of 81. The cause of death was cancer.

He is survived by his wife, three children and seven grandchildren.

<doc id="208589" wikidata="Q5352166" url="?curid=208589" title="Emperor of India">
<text>Emperor or Empress of India was a title used by British monarchs from 1 May 1876 (with the Royal Titles Act 1876) to 22 June 1948 to signify their sovereignty over the British Raj as its imperial head of state. The image of the Emperor or Empress appeared on Indian currency, in government buildings, railway stations, courts, on statues etc. Oaths of allegiance were made to the Emperor or Empress and the lawful successors by the governors-general, princes, governors, commissioners in India in events such as imperial durbars.

The title was abolished on 22 June 1948, with the Indian Independence Act 1947, under which George VI made a royal proclamation that the words &quot;Emperor of India&quot; were to be omitted in styles of address and from customary titles. This was almost a year after he became the titular head of the newly partitioned and independent dominions of India and Pakistan in 1947. These were abolished upon the establishment of the Republic of India in 1950 and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan in 1956.

==History==

After the nominal Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar was deposed at the conclusion of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (10 May 1857 – 1 November 1858), the government of the United Kingdom decided to transfer control of British India and the princely states from the mercantile East India Company (EIC) to the Crown, thus marking the beginning of the British Raj. The EIC was officially dissolved on 1 June 1874, and the British prime minister, Benjamin Disraeli, decided to offer Queen Victoria the title &quot;Empress of India&quot; shortly afterwards. Victoria accepted this style on 1 May 1876. The first Delhi Durbar (which served as an imperial coronation) was held in her honour eight months later on 1 January 1877.

The idea of having Queen Victoria proclaimed Empress of India was not particularly new, as Lord Ellenborough had already suggested it in 1843 upon becoming the governor-general of India. By 1874, Major-General Sir Henry Ponsonby, the Queen&#x27;s private secretary, had ordered English charters to be scrutinised for imperial titles, with Edgar and Stephen mentioned as sound precedents. The Queen, possibly irritated by the sallies of the republicans, the tendency to democracy, and the realisation that her influence was manifestly on the decline, was urging the move. Another factor may have been that the Queen&#x27;s first child, Victoria, was married to Frederick, the heir apparent to the German Empire. Upon becoming empress, she would outrank her mother. By January 1876, the Queen&#x27;s insistence was so great that Benjamin Disraeli felt that he could procrastinate no longer. Initially, Victoria had considered the style &quot;Empress of Great Britain, Ireland, and India&quot;, but Disraeli had persuaded the Queen to limit the title to India in order to avoid controversy. Hence, the title &quot;Kaisar-i-Hind&quot; was coined in 1876 by the orientalist G.W. Leitner as the official imperial title for the British monarch in India. The term &quot;Kaisar-i-Hind&quot; means emperor of India in the vernacular of the Hindi and Urdu languages. The word &quot;kaisar&quot;, meaning &#x27;emperor&#x27;, is a derivative of the Roman imperial title (via Persian and Ottoman Turkish – see ), and is cognate with the German title , which was borrowed from the Latin at an earlier date.

Many in the United Kingdom, however, regarded the assumption of the title as an obvious development from the Government of India Act 1858, which resulted in the founding of British India, ruled directly by the Crown. The public were of the opinion that the title of &quot;queen&quot; was no longer adequate for the ceremonial ruler of what was often referred to informally as the &quot;Indian Empire&quot;. The new styling underlined the fact that the native states were no longer a mere agglomeration but a collective entity.

When Edward VII ascended to the throne on 22 January 1901, he continued the imperial tradition laid down by his mother, Queen Victoria, by adopting the title Emperor of India. Three subsequent British monarchs followed in his footsteps, and the title continued to be used after India and Pakistan had become independent on 15 August 1947. It was not until 22 June 1948 that the style was officially abolished.

The first emperor to visit India was George V. For his imperial coronation ceremony at the Delhi Durbar, the Imperial Crown of India was created. The Crown weighs and is set with 6,170 diamonds, 9 emeralds, 4 rubies, and 4 sapphires. At the front is a very fine emerald weighing . The King wrote in his diary that it was heavy and uncomfortable to wear: &quot;Rather tired after wearing my crown for hours; it hurt my head, as it is pretty heavy.&quot;

The title &quot;Emperor of India&quot; did not disappear when British India became the Union of India (1947–1950) and Dominion of Pakistan (1947–1952) after independence in 1947. George VI retained the title until 22 June 1948, the date of a Royal Proclamation made in accordance with Section 7 (2) of the Indian Independence Act 1947, reading: &quot;The assent of the Parliament of the United Kingdom is hereby given to the omission from the Royal Style and Titles of the words and the words &quot;Emperor of India&quot; and to the issue by His Majesty for that purpose of His Royal Proclamation under the Great Seal of the Realm.&quot; Thereafter, George VI remained monarch of Pakistan until his death in 1952, and of India until it became the Republic of India on 26 January 1950.

British coins, as well as those of the Empire and the Commonwealth, had routinely included the abbreviated title . Coins in India, on the other hand, had the word &quot;empress&quot;, and later &quot;king-emperor&quot; in English. The title appeared on coinage in the United Kingdom throughout 1948, with a further Royal Proclamation made on 22 December under the Coinage Act 1870 to omit the abbreviated title.

<doc id="208591" wikidata="Q168776" url="?curid=208591" title="Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire">
<text>Ibrahim (; ; ; 5 November 1615 – 18 August 1648) was the sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1640 until 1648. He was born in Constantinople, the last son of sultan Ahmed I by Kösem Sultan, an ethnic Greek originally named Anastasia.

He was called Ibrahim the Mad () due to his mental condition and behavior. However, historian Scott Rank notes that his opponents spread rumors of the sultan&#x27;s insanity, and some historians suggest he was more incompetent than mad.

==Early life==
Ibrahim was born on 5 November 1615, the son of Sultan Ahmed I and his Haseki Sultan and perhaps legal wife, Kösem Sultan. When Ibrahim was 2, his father suddenly died, and Ibrahim&#x27;s uncle Mustafa I became the new sultan. Kösem Sultan and her children, including young Ibrahim, were sent to the Old Palace. After his brother Murad IV inherited the throne from his uncle Mustafa I, Ibrahim was confined in the Kafes, which affected his health. Murad had Ibrahim&#x27;s other brothers Şehzade Bayezid, Şehzade Süleyman and Şehzade Kasım executed and Ibrahim feared he would be next, but after his brother Murad&#x27;s death, Ibrahim became Sultan.

==Reign==
===Accession===
One of the most notorious Ottoman Sultans, Ibrahim spent all of his early life in the close confinement of the Kafes before succeeding his brother Murad IV (1623–40) in 1640. Three of their brothers had been executed by Murad, and Ibrahim lived in terror of being the next to die. His life was saved only by the intercession of Kösem Sultan, mother of Ibrahim and Murad.

Murad&#x27;s death left Ibrahim as the sole surviving prince of the dynasty. Upon being asked by Grand Vizier Kemankeş Kara Mustafa Pasha to assume the Sultanate, Ibrahim suspected Murad was still alive and plotting to trap him. It took the combined persuasion of Kösem and the Grand Vizier, and personal examination of his brother&#x27;s dead body, to make Ibrahim accept the throne.

===Early reign===
During the early years of Ibrahim&#x27;s reign, he retreated from politics and turned increasingly to his harem for comfort and pleasure. During his sultanate, the harem achieved new levels of luxury in perfumes, textiles and jewellery. His love of women and furs led him to have a room entirely lined with lynx and sable. Because of his infatuation with furs, the French dubbed him &quot;Le Fou de Fourrures.&quot; Kösem Sultan kept her son in check by supplying him with virgins she personally purchased from the slave market, as well as overweight women, whom he craved.

An account of his reign is given by Demetrius Cantemir. He wrote of Ibrahim: 
Kara Mustafa Pasha remained as Grand Vizier during the first four years of Ibrahim&#x27;s reign, keeping the Empire stable. With the Treaty of Sèvres (15 March 1642) he renewed peace with Austria and in the same year recovered Azov from the Cossacks. Kara Mustafa also stabilized the currency with coinage reform, sought to stabilize the economy with a new land-survey, reduced the number of janissaries, removed non-contributing members from the state payrolls, and curbed the power of disobedient provincial governors. During these years, Ibrahim showed concern with properly ruling the empire, as shown in his handwritten communications with the Grand Vizier. Kara Mustafa in turn wrote a memo on public affairs to coach his inexperienced master. Ibrahim&#x27;s replies to Kara Mustafa&#x27;s reports show he had actually received a good education. Ibrahim often traveled in disguise, inspecting the markets of Istanbul and ordering the Grand Vizier to correct any problems he observed.

===Decadence and crisis===

Ibrahim was often distracted by recurring headaches and attacks of physical weakness, perhaps caused by the trauma of his early years. Since he was the only surviving male member of the Ottoman dynasty, Ibrahim was encouraged by his mother Kösem Sultan to distract himself with harem girls and soon fathered three future sultans: Mehmed IV, Suleiman II and Ahmed II. The distractions of the harem allowed Kösem Sultan to gain power and rule in his name, yet even she fell victim to the Sultan&#x27;s disfavor and left the Imperial Palace.

Ibrahim came under the influence of various unsuitable people, such as mistress of the imperial harem Şekerpare Hatun and the charlatan Cinci Hoca, who pretended to cure the Sultan&#x27;s physical ailments. The latter, along with his allies Silahdar Yusuf Agha and Sultanzade Mehmed Pasha, enriched themselves with bribes and eventually usurped enough power to secure the execution of Grand Vizier Ḳara Muṣṭafā. Cinci Hoca became Kadiasker (High Judge) of Anatolia. Yusuf Agha became Kapudan Pasha (Grand Admiral) and Sultanzade Mehmed, Grand Vizier.

In 1644, Maltese corsairs seized a ship carrying high-status pilgrims to Mecca. Since the pirates had docked in Crete, Kapudan Yusuf Pasha encouraged Ibrahim to invade the island. This began 24 years of war with Venice. Crete did not completely fall under Ottoman domination until 1669. In spite of the decline of &quot;La Serenissima&quot;, Venetian ships won victories throughout the Aegean, capturing Tenedos (1646) and blockading the Dardanelles. Kapudan Yusuf enjoyed temporary success in conquering Canea, starting a jealous rivalry with Nevesinli Salih Pasha, the recently installed grand vizier. The rivalry led to Yusuf&#x27;s execution (January 1646) and the Grand Vizier&#x27;s deposition (December 1645).

With his cronies in power, Ibrahim&#x27;s extravagant tendencies went unchecked. He raised eight concubines to the favored position of haseki (royal consort), granting each riches and land. After legally marrying the concubine Telli Haseki, he ordered the palace of Ibrahim Pasha to be carpeted in sable furs and given to her.

==Deposition and execution==
Mass discontent was caused by the Venetian blockade of the Dardanelles—which created scarcities in the capital—and the imposition of heavy taxes during a war economy to pay for Ibrahim&#x27;s whims. In 1647 the Grand Vizier Nevesinli Salih Pasha, Kösem Sultan, and the şeyhülislam Abdürrahim Efendi unsuccessfully plotted to depose the sultan and replace him with one of his sons. Salih Pasha was executed, and Kösem Sultan was exiled from the harem.

The next year, the Janissaries and members of the ulema revolted. On 8 August 1648, corrupt Grand Vizier Ahmed Pasha was strangled and torn to shreds by an angry mob, gaining the posthumous nickname &quot;Hezarpare&quot; (&quot;thousand pieces&quot;). On the same day, Ibrahim was seized and imprisoned in Topkapı Palace. Kösem gave consent to her son&#x27;s fall, saying &quot;In the end he will leave neither you nor me alive. We will lose control of the government. The whole society is in ruins. Have him removed from the throne immediately.&quot;

Ibrahim&#x27;s six-year-old son Meḥmed was made sultan. The new grand vizier, Sofu Mehmed Pasha, petitioned the sheikh ul-Islam for a fatwā sanctioning Ibrahim&#x27;s execution. It was granted, with the message &quot;if there are two caliphs, kill one of them.&quot; Kösem also gave her consent. Two executioners were sent for; one being the chief executioner who had served under Ibrahim. As the executioners drew closer, it was reported that Ibrahim&#x27;s last words were: &quot;Is there no one among those who have eaten my bread who will take pity on me and protect me? These cruel men have come to kill me. Mercy! Mercy!&quot; As his mother, Kösem Sultan, and officials watched from a palace window, Ibrahim was strangled on 18 August 1648. His death was the second regicide in the history of the Ottoman Empire.

==Family==
In addition to his eight Haseki Sultans (the first and only certain case of the coexistence of several Haseki at the same time and a symptom of the loss of prestige and exclusivity of the title which began under Murad IV) he had a large number of concubines, of which only some are known. However, only Şivekar Sultan and Hümaşah Sultan, who also became his legal wife, had any real political power or influence over the sultan. Ibrahim was particularly famous for his brief but intense love obsessions, often with women who were not part of his harem and that he had his agents commandeer around the city.

Other anecdotes related to his harem are Ibrahim&#x27;s supposed passion for obese women, which would have led Şivekar, called &quot;the fattest woman at Constantinople&quot;, to become his favorite, and the story that he drowned 280 concubines in his harem because of a rumor that one of them had had a forbidden relationship with a man, an anecdote however rejected by several historians as invented or exaggerated.
=== Consorts ===
Ibrahim I had eight Haseki Sultans, the last of whom was also his legal wife, plus a number of known and unknown minor concubines:

==== Hasekis ====
All of Ibrahim&#x27;s Hasekis received 1,000 aspers a day except for Saliha Dilaşub Sultan who received 1,300 aspers a day. Ibrahim gifted the incomes of Bolu, Hamid, Nicopolis Sanjaks, and Syria Eyalet to Saliha Dilaşub, Mahienver, Saçbağlı, and Şivekar Sultans respectively. He also lavished the treasury of Egypt upon Saçbağlı Sultan and Hümaşah Sultan, and presented the Ibrahim Pasha Palace to Hümaşah. His known consorts were:
* Turhan Sultan, BaşHaseki (First Haseki) and mother, Valide Sultan and regent of Mehmed IV. She was of Russian origin and her original name was Nadya. After her son&#x27;s accession to the throne, she protected Ibrahim&#x27;s remaining children from execution, resulting in the definitive abandonment of the Law of Fratricide. 
* Saliha Dilaşub Sultan, also called Aşub Sultan or Aşube Sultan. She was the second Haseki and mother and Valide Sultan of Suleiman II; she was Ibrahim&#x27;s first concubine. She was of Serbian origin and her original name was Katarina.
* Muazzez Sultan, third Haseki, and the mother of Ahmed II. She predeceased her son and therefore was never Valide Sultan.
* Ayşe Sultan (died 1675), fourth Haseki, she was titled as such in January 1645. She was of Tatar origins.
* Mâhenver Sultan, fifth Haseki; She appeared as the Sultan&#x27;s consort in 1645; and is mentioned for the first time in 2 May 1646. She was of Circassian origin.
* Saçbağı Sultan, sixth Haseki, she was of Circassian origin and her original name was Leyla.
* Şivekar Sultan, seventh Haseki, she was called &quot;the fattest woman in the capital&quot; and was one of only two politically active consorts of Ibrahim. She was of Armenian descent and her original name was Maria.
* Hümaşah Sultan, eighth Haseki and Ibrahim&#x27;s only legal wife. After the wedding, she was nicknamed &quot;Telli Haseki&quot;. She was of Georgian or Circassian descent. She was one of only two politically active consorts of Ibrahim. Years after Ibrahim&#x27;s death, in 1672, she remarried the Kaymakam of Constantinople, Ibrahim Pasha.

==== Concubines ====
* Zafire Hatun, called also Zarife. Georgian concubine. While he was still a prince, she became pregnant in violation of the rules of the harem. Kösem Sultan, Ibrahim&#x27;s mother, handed her over to the kızları agasi Sümbül Ağa and ordered for her to be drowned, but the man hid her in his house, where she gave birth to her son. Having discovered this, Kösem exiled them to Egypt, but the ship was attacked. While the child was saved and taken to Malta, it is not known what happened to Zafire.
* Hubyar Hatun. One of the concubines Ibrahim became infatuated with for a while. She was then released and given in marriage to Ibrahim Ağa. 
* Şekerpare Hatun. Before one of Ibrahim’s concubines, she then became musahibe (companion), treasurer and hostess of the harem.
* Sakizula Hatun. 
* Şekerbanu Hatun. 
* Hatice Hatun. 
* The wife of the Grand Vizier Hezarpare Ahmed Paşah. After having fallen in love with her, Ibrahim forced her to divorce her husband. In return, both Ahmed Pasha and his son received a daughter of Ibrahim as a wife, respectively the little Beyhan Sultan, at the time one year (according to some sources she was later raised by his ex-wife), and Safiye Sultan, the eldest.
* The daughter of Şeyhülislam Muid Ahmed Efendi. According to A.L. Castellan, Ibrahim asked her for his harem, but her father objected, so the sultan had her kidnapped from the baths, and then sent her home after some time.

=== Sons ===
Ibrahim I had at least ten sons: 
* &quot;(Şehzade) Fülan&quot; (before 1640, Constantinople – ?) – with Zafire Hatun. Conceived while Ibrahim was still Şehzade in violation of the rules of the harem. Kösem Sultan, mother of Ibrahim, ordered that the pregnant mother be drowned. She was saved from the kızları agasi and gave birth to a son, who became known as &quot;the bastard of the black eunuch&quot;. Having discovered this, Kösem exiled the three to Egypt, but the ship was attacked. The child was taken to Malta, where he was proclaimed &quot;Ottoman prince&quot;. He later converted to Christianity and preached under the name of &quot;Ottoman Father&quot;. According to the Venetian ambassador, history was among the factors that tended the relations between the Ottoman Empire and the Most Serene Republic of Venice in 1645.
* Mehmed IV (2 January 1642, Constantinople – 6 January 1693, Edirne) – with Turhan Sultan. 19th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire.
* Suleiman II (15 April 1642, Constantinople – 22 June 1691, Edirne) – with Saliha Dilaşub Sultan. 20th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. 
* Ahmed II (25 February 1643, Constantinople – 6 February 1695, Edirne) – with Muazzez Sultan. 21st Sultan of the Ottoman Empire.
* Şehzade Murad (April 1643, Constantinople – 16 January 1644, Constantinople). 
* Şehzade Selim (19 March 1644, Constantinople – September 1669, Constantinople or Edirne). He lived and died in the &quot;Kafes&quot;. 
* Şehzade Osman (August 1644, Constantinople – 1646, Constantinople). 
* Şehzade Bayezid (1 May 1646, Constantinople – August 1647, Constantinople). 
* Şehzade Cihangir (14 December 1646, Constantinople – 1 December 1648, Constantinople) – with Şivekar Sultan;
* Şehzade Orhan (October 1648, Constantinople – January 1650, Constantinople) – with Hümaşah Sultan.
At one point, Ibrahim took a great liking to the infant son of a slave woman, to the extent of preferring the unrelated child to his son Mehmed. Turhan, Mehmed&#x27;s mother, grew extremely jealous and vented her anger to Ibrahim, who flew into a rage and grabbed Mehmed from Turhan&#x27;s arms and threw him into a pool. Mehmed would have drowned if a servant had not rescued him. He was left with a permanent scar on his forehead.

=== Daughters ===
Ibrahim I had at least ten daughters: 
* Safiye Sultan (1640, Constantinople – ?) – perhaps with Saliha Dilaşub Sultan. She married Baki Bey, son of the Grand Vizier Hezarpare Ahmed Paşah by his first wife. Buried in Ahmed I&#x27;s mausoleum, Sultan Ahmed Mosque. 
*Fatma Sultan (between September and December 1642, Constantinople –1657) – perhaps with Turhan Sultan. In 1645 she married Musahip Silahdar Yusuf Paşah, who was executed on January 22, 1646. A month later, her father married her to Musahib Fazlı Paşa, who Ibrahim exiled a couple of months after while causing to divorce them. She was buried in the Yeni Valide mosque. Turhan Sultan took care of her grave.
* Gevherhan Sultan (1642, Constantinople – 27 October 1694, Edirne) – perhaps with Muazzez Sultan. She was married three times: to Cafer Pasha on 23 November 1646, to Admiral of the Fleet and vizier Çavușzade Mehmed Pasha (died 1681), and to Helvacı Yusuf Pasha (died 1714) on 13 January 1692.
* Beyhan Sultan (1645, Constantinople – 15 September 1700, buried in Süleyman I Mausoleum, Süleymaniye Mosque) – perhaps with Turhan Sultan. She was married four times: to Kücük Hasan Pasha in 1646, to Grand Vizier Hezarpare Ahmed Pasha (murdered 1648) in 1647, to Uzun Ibrahim Pasha (executed 1683), and to Bıyıklı Mustafa Pasha (died 1699) in 1689. By his fourth marriage she had a son, Sultanzade Hüseyin Bey (1690 - 1754). 
* Ayşe Sultan (1646, Constantinople – 1675, Cairo). She married two times. She married Defterdar Ibrahim Paşah, governator of Cairo, and was widowed in 1664. She finally married her cousin, the governor of Buda and Cairo Sultanzade Canbuladzade Hüseyn Pasha, son of Fatma Sultan.
* Atike Sultan (?, Constantinople – ) – perhaps with Turhan Sultan. She was married three times: to Sarı Kenan Pasha (executed 1659) in 1648, to Boşnak İsmail Pasha (killed 1664) in 1659, and to Gürcü Mehmed Pasha in 1665. 
* Kaya Sultan (?, Constantinople – ?). She married Haydarağazade Mehmed Paşa in 1649, who was executed in 1661.
* Ümmügülsüm Sultan (?, Constantinople – 1654), she was called also Ümmi Sultan. She was married in 1653 to Abaza Ahmed Pasha (died 1656). She died soon after the wedding.
* Hatice Sultan (?, Constantinople – ?, Constantinople). Died in infancy.
* Bican Sultan (/1649, Constantinople – ?). She was born posthumously as Ibrahim&#x27;s last child. She was proposed in marriage to Kuloğlu Musahip Mustafa Paşah, but he refused her (he would later marry Mehmed IV&#x27;s daughter, Hatice Sultan, in 1675). She was then married to Cerrah Kasım Paşah, in January 1666.

== In popular culture ==
The tragic play &quot;Ibrahim, the Thirteenth Emperor of the Turks&quot;, written by Mary Pix and first performed in 1699, purported to describe incidents in Ibrahim&#x27;s life. The numbering is correct only if Mehmed the Conqueror is regarded as the First Emperor, and the disputed reign of his son Cem is counted as well.

In the Turkish series &quot;Muhteşem Yüzyıl: Kösem&quot; he is portrayed by actor Ridvan Aybars Duzey as a prince and by Tugay Mercan as a Sultan.

In the film &quot;Three Thousand Years of Longing&quot; (2022), Ibrahim is portrayed by Jack Braddy, with Hugo Vella as him as a child.

<text>Mehmed IV (; ; 2 January 1642 – 6 January 1693), nicknamed as Mehmed the Hunter (), was the sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1648 to 1687. He came to the throne at the age of six after his father was overthrown in a coup. Mehmed went on to become the second-longest-reigning sultan in Ottoman history after Suleiman the Magnificent. While the initial and final years of his reign were characterized by military defeat and political instability, during his middle years he oversaw the revival of the empire&#x27;s fortunes associated with the Köprülü era. Mehmed IV was known by contemporaries as a particularly pious ruler, and was referred to as gazi, or &quot;holy warrior&quot; for his role in the many conquests carried out during his long reign.

Under Mehmed IV&#x27;s reign, the empire reached the height of its territorial expansion in Europe. From a young age he developed a keen interest in hunting, for which he is known as &quot;avcı&quot; (translated as &quot;the Hunter&quot;). In 1687, Mehmed was overthrown by soldiers disenchanted by the course of the ongoing War of the Holy League. He subsequently retired to Edirne, where he resided and died of natural causes in 1693.

==Early life==
Born at Topkapı Palace, Constantinople, in 1642, Mehmed was the son of Sultan Ibrahim (r. 1640–48) by Turhan Sultan, a concubine of Russian origin, and grandson of the Greek-born Kösem Sultan. Soon after his birth, his father and mother quarrelled, and Ibrahim was so enraged that he tore Mehmed from his mother&#x27;s arms and flung the infant into a cistern. Mehmed was rescued by the harem servants. However, this left Mehmed with a lifelong scar on his head.

==Reign==
===Accession===
Mehmed ascended to the throne in 1648 at the age of six, during a very volatile time for the Ottoman dynasty. On 21 October 1649, Mehmed along with his brothers Suleiman and Ahmed were circumcised. 

Kösem Sultan, Mehmed&#x27;s grandmother and regent, was suspected of supporting the rebels and plotting to poison the sultan and replace him with his younger half-brother, Suleiman. As a result, Mehmed agreed to sign his grandmother&#x27;s death warrant in September 1651.

The empire faced palace intrigues as well as uprisings in Anatolia, the defeat of the Ottoman navy by the Venetians outside the Dardanelles, and food shortages leading to riots in Constantinople. It was under these circumstances that Mehmed&#x27;s mother granted Köprülü Mehmed Pasha full executive powers as Grand Vizier. Köprülü took office on 14 September 1656. Mehmed IV presided over the Köprülü era, an exceptionally stable period of Ottoman history. Mehmed is known as &quot;Avcı&quot;, &quot;the Hunter&quot;, as this outdoor exercise took up much of his time.

===Wars===

Mehmed&#x27;s reign is notable for a revival of Ottoman fortunes led by the Grand Vizier Köprülü Mehmed and his son Fazıl Ahmed. They regained the Aegean islands from Venice, and Crete, during the Cretan War (1645–1669). They also fought successful campaigns against Transylvania (1660) and Poland (1670–1674). When Mehmed IV accepted the vassalage of Petro Doroshenko, Ottoman rule extended into Podolia and Right-bank Ukraine. This event would lead the Ottomans into the Russo-Turkish War (1676–1681). His next vizier, Köprülü Mehmed&#x27;s adopted son Merzifonlu Kara Mustafa, led campaigns against Russia, besieging Chyhyryn in 1678 with 70,000 men. He next supported the 1683 Hungarian uprising of Imre Thököly against Austrian rule, marching a vast army through Hungary and besieged Vienna. At the Battle of Vienna on the Kahlenberg Heights, the Ottomans suffered a catastrophic rout by Polish-Lithuanian forces famously led by King John III Sobieski (1674–1696), and his allies, notably the Imperial army.

In 1672 and 1673, the sultan, who embarked on two Polish-Lithuanian campaigns with &quot;serdar-ı ekrem&quot; and Grand Vizier Fazıl Ahmed Pasha, and the acquisition of the Kamaniçi Castle, returned to Edirne after the signing of the Bucaş Treaty.

===Fire of 1660===
The fire of 4–5 July 1660 was the worst conflagration Constantinople had experienced to date. It started in Eminönü and spread to most of the historic peninsula, burning much of the city. Even the minarets of Suleiman I&#x27;s mosque burned. Two-thirds of Istanbul was turned to ash in the conflagration, and as many as forty thousand people were killed. Thousands died in the famine and plague which followed the fire.

===Great Turkish War===


On 12 September 1683, the Austrians and their Polish-Lithuanian allies under King John III Sobieski won the Battle of Vienna with a devastating flank attack led by Sobieski&#x27;s Polish cavalry. The Turks retreated into Hungary; however, this was only the beginning of the Great Turkish War, as the armies of the Holy League began their successful campaign to push the Ottomans back to the Balkans.

===Later life and death===

In May 1675, Mehmed IV&#x27;s sons Mustafa II and Ahmed III were circumcised and his daughter Hatice Sultan was married. The empire celebrated it with Famous Edirne Festival to mark the occasion. Silahdar Findikli Mehmed Aga described Mehmed as a medium-sized, stocky, white-skinned, sun-burnt face, with a sparse beard, leaning forward from the waist up because he rides a lot.

1680 witnessed the only known stoning to death of a woman convicted of adultery in Ottoman Istanbul. The unnamed woman was stoned to death on Istanbul&#x27;s Hippodrome after allegedly being caught alone with a Jewish man, violating Ottoman law which forbade sexual relations between Christian or Jewish men and Muslim women. Mehmed IV witnessed the double execution: he offered the man conversion to Islam so as to avoid being stoned to death (he was beheaded instead).

After the Second Battle of Mohács in 1687, the Ottoman Empire fell into deep crisis. There was a mutiny among the Ottoman troops. The commander and Grand Vizier, Sarı Süleyman Pasha, became frightened that he would be killed by his own troops and fled from his command, first to Belgrade and then to Istanbul. When the news of the defeat and the mutiny arrived in Istanbul in early September, Abaza Siyavuş Pasha was appointed as the commander and soon afterward as the Grand Vizier. However, before he could take over his command, the whole Ottoman Army had disintegrated and the Ottoman household troops (Janissaries and sipahis) started to return to their base in Istanbul under their own lower-rank officers. Sarı Suleiman Pasha was executed, and Sultan Mehmed IV appointed the commander of Istanbul Straits, Köprülü Fazıl Mustafa Pasha, as the Grand Vizier&#x27;s regent in Istanbul. Fazıl Mustafa made consultations with the leaders of the army that existed and the other leading Ottoman statesmen.

After these, on 8 November 1687, it was decided to depose Sultan Mehmed IV and to enthrone his brother Suleiman II as the new Sultan. Mehmed was deposed by the combined forces of Janissaries and Sekbans commanded by Osman Pasha. Mehmed was then imprisoned in Topkapı Palace. However, he was permitted to leave the Palace from time to time, as he died in Edirne Palace in 1693. He was buried in Turhan Sultan&#x27;s tomb, near his mother&#x27;s mosque in Constantinople. In 1691, a couple of years before his death, a plot was discovered in which the senior clerics of the empire planned to reinstate Mehmed on the throne in response to the ill health and imminent death of his successor, Suleiman II.

==Family==

===Consorts===
Mehmed IV had an Haseki Sultan and several secondary concubines. However, the lack of information about them (except for his Haseki) and the relatively low number of children has created controversy over the actual existence of some of them. 

Mehmed IV&#x27;s known consorts are:
*Emetullah Rabia Gülnuş Sultan. Of Greek origin, her real name was Evmania Voria. She was the first concubine of Mehmed IV and the most beloved, his Haseki and mother of two sultans. She became particularly famous for her many travels, first accompanying the sultan and then her two sons wherever they went. The Yeni Valide mosque was built in her honor by their son Ahmed III.
*Afife Hatun. Also called Afife Kadın, she was Mehmed&#x27;s second favorite and a poet. During the period of confinement in the Eski Saray after the deposition of Mehmed IV, she wrote verses dedicated to his pain and to that of Gülnuş, who &quot;screamed until she hurt her lungs&quot;, while Mehmed, in his room, wept for not being able to console her. Mehmed dedicated some poems to her, also.
*Gülnar Hatun. Also called Gülnar Kadın. Her existence is controversial, with some historians speculating that she may be Gülnuş herself, whose name was misspelled by some.
*Nevruz Hatun. Also known as Nevruz Kadın, she founded a school in the Süleymaniye neighborhood. 
*Güneş Hatun. Her existence is controversial, with some historians speculating that she may be Gülnuş herself, whose name was misspelled by some.
*Gülbeyaz Hatun. Mother of a daughter, according to the chronicles she was killed out of jealousy by Gülnuş, who threw her off a cliff, or had her killed by strangulation. Her existence is controversial.
*Hatice Hatun. She was killed by &quot;Güneş Hatun&quot; (Gülnuş herself according to some historians). Her existence is controversial.
*Cihanşah Hatun
*Dürriye Hatun
*Kaniye Hatun
*Rukiye Hatun
*Siyavuş Hatun
*Rabia Hatun. Also called Rabia Kadin. Uncertain existence, she was a poet. Could be a pseudonym of Afife Hatun.

===Sons===
Mehmed IV had at least four sons:
*Mustafa II (6 February 1664 – 29 December 1703) – with Gülnuş Sultan. 22nd Sultan of the Ottoman Empire 
*Ahmed III (31 December 1673 – 1 July 1736) – with Gülnuş Sultan. He was born in Bulgaria, first sultan to be born out of Turkey since the time of Suleiman I. 23rd Sultan of the Ottoman Empire
*Şehzade Bayezid (15 December 1678 – 18 January 1679, buried in Sultan Mustafa I Mausoleum, Hagia Sophia)
*Şehzade Süleyman (13 February 1681 – before 1691)

===Daughters===
Mehmed IV had at least eight daughters: 
*Hatice Sultan ( 1660 – 5 July 1743), – with Gülnuş Sultan, She married twice and she had five sons and a daughter. 
*Ümmi Sultan. She died in infancy. 
*&quot;Fülane&quot; Sultan (1668? – ?). She married Kasım Mustafa Paşah, governor of Edirne, in 1687.
*Ayşe Sultan ( – ) – with Gülnuş Sultan. Nicknamed Küçük Sultan, that means &quot;little princess&quot;. At the age of around two years, she was betrothed to Kara Mustafa Paşah, but the baby girl died shortly after and the marriage never took place.
*Ümmügülsüm Sultan ( – 9 May 1720) – with Gülnuş Sultan. Also called Ümmi Sultan or Gülsüm Sultan. She was the favorite niece of her uncle Ahmed II, who after the deposition of her father treated her as his daughter, so much so that he kept her at court with him, unlike her sisters. She married once and had three daughters. She was buried in the Yeni Cami Mosque.
*Fatma Emetullah Sultan ( – 13 December 1700) – with Gülnuş Sultan. She married twice and she had two daughters.
*&quot;Fülane&quot; Sultan (? – ?) – presumed daughter with Gülbeyaz Hatun
*Gevherhan Sultan (? – ?). Called also Gevher Sultan.

<text>The double florin, or four-shilling piece, was a British coin produced by the Royal Mint between 1887 and 1890. One of the shortest-lived of all British coin denominations, it was struck in only four years. Its obverse, designed by Joseph Boehm and engraved by Leonard Charles Wyon, depicts Queen Victoria, whilst the reverse, featuring national symbols of the United Kingdom, was designed by Wyon based on the coinage of Charles II.

The double florin was introduced as part of a coinage redesign that took place in 1887, the year of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee. One purpose of the redesign was to replace portraits of the queen which had changed little since her youth, and which no longer resembled the monarch, who was nearing her seventieth birthday. Mint officials and politicians also sought to reduce dependence on the half sovereign, a gold coin worth ten shillings which was expensive to strike, by issuing the double florin (four shillings) and reintroducing the crown (five shillings) coin. They may also have intended a further decimalisation of the coinage after the introduction of the florin (two shillings, or one-tenth of a pound) in 1849.

When issued in June 1887, the Jubilee coinage provoked an outcry. The small royal crown Boehm had placed on Victoria&#x27;s head caused widespread mockery. The double florin in particular was criticised as it was close in size to the five-shilling crown, leading to confusion, especially since neither coin was inscribed with its denomination. The confusion was said to be particularly acute in public houses, where barmaids accepted it believing it to be a crown, giving it the nickname of &quot;Barmaid&#x27;s Ruin&quot; or &quot;Barmaid&#x27;s Grief&quot;. Minting of the coin ceased after 1890, though it remained in circulation. Upon full decimalisation in 1971, the double florin was not demonetised, and remains legal tender for 20p (£0.20).

== Background ==
During the 19th century, Britain continued its longtime monetary system, under which 12 pence constituted a shilling, and 20 shillings a pound. There was interest in decimalisation of this system, and in 1849, the florin, equal to two shillings or one tenth of a pound, was issued as a first step. It was intended to replace the half crown, worth two shillings and sixpence, and production of the half crown was discontinued in 1850, but resumed in 1874, and both coins were struck until full decimalisation in the 1970s. The crown, or five-shilling piece, was not struck for circulation between 1847 and 1887; the 1847 coinage was struck in limited numbers and possibly intended as keepsakes. When a double florin was proposed by a director of the Bank of England in 1874, the Deputy Master of the Royal Mint, Charles Fremantle, opposed it.

The next largest coin in denomination was the gold half sovereign, equal to ten shillings. This was a small coin, equal in size to the silver sixpence (plating sixpences and passing them for half sovereigns was a continuing abuse). The government discouraged the use of half sovereigns—unlike silver coins, the sovereign and half sovereign were to contain their full value in precious metal, to an exacting standard set by the Coinage Act 1870. These limits were so tight that 45 per cent of newly-struck half sovereigns were rejected by the automatic scales at the Royal Mint, requiring their recoinage. The government profited through seignorage on silver coins at about 20 per cent, depending on the price of silver. Thus, the half sovereign was expensive in terms of both the value of its metal and its production costs, especially in comparison with the silver coinage. Such problems were less acute with the sovereign, for which demand continued high as a world-wide trade coin, whereas the half sovereign tended to remain in Britain. In 1884, the Gladstone government proposed to reduce the amount of gold in the half sovereign by a tenth, rendering it a token coin, but the change was abandoned. British gold coins were legal tender for payments in any amount, but silver coins were only legal tender to forty shillings.

==Inception==
In September 1886, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Randolph Churchill, replied sympathetically to a proposal in the House of Commons to abolish the half sovereign and replace it with silver coins. Although Churchill was noncommittal, his son and biographer Winston wrote that he &quot;harboured a deadly design against the half-sovereign—&#x27;that profligate little coin&#x27;—which he believed was an expensive and unnecessary feature of British currency&quot;. Lord Randolph came to favour withdrawal of the half sovereign, with its place taken by large silver coins, and the redemption of outstanding half sovereigns to be paid for in part with silver coins and in part with £1 bank notes, with some portion to be replaced with sovereigns. Since this would mean the largest denomination coin with which change could be given from a pound would be the half crown, James Currie, governor of the Bank of England, suggested a double florin to aid in change giving. Before these matters could be decided, Lord Randolph resigned as chancellor in late December 1886. His successor, George Goschen, was slow to decide whether to discontinue the half sovereign, and eventually decided against it. Nevertheless, Goschen was no supporter of the half sovereign, and none were struck at the Royal Mint&#x27;s facility at Tower Hill between June 1887 and February 1890.

Among those pressing for the issuance of large silver coins were the supporters of bimetallism, making both gold and silver legal tender. A four-shilling piece had been common in proposals for a fully bimetallic coinage since at least 1868. Increasing the amount of silver used for coinage would be a step towards bimetallism. The issue of bimetallism was especially acute in Britain in the mid-1880s because of the problems in British India, where the government received revenue in silver but then had to make payments to Britain in gold, at a time when the value of silver relative to gold was decreasing. Increased seignorage from large silver coins might allow Britain to grant India financial relief.

No document has been found that clearly explains the decision to issue a double florin. The numismatist G. P. Dyer, in his article on the influences that brought about the double florin, wrote:

Sir John Clapham, in his 1944 history of the Bank of England, described the double florin as &quot;a half-hearted concession to admirers of the decimal system&quot;. Issuance of the double florin was also justified in the hope that, as a large silver &quot;dollar&quot;-sized coin, it would compete with the Mexican &quot;dollar&quot; as a trade coin in the Far East, and Fremantle was encouraged when £1,000 of the new coins were distributed to a bank connected with the Eastern trade in 1887. Nevertheless, the intrinsic value of the double florin was about sixpence less than the Mexican coin, and less than five per cent of double florins were sent abroad.

==Design==
===Obverse===

By 1887, Queen Victoria had been on the throne for half a century, and was nearly 70 years old. Nevertheless, the coins of the United Kingdom still depicted her as a young woman, as they had since the first issuance of coins depicting her in 1838. Her Golden Jubilee in 1887 gave an opportunity to place new designs on the coinage, and all the circulation coins but the bronze pieces saw a new portrait of her that year.

In 1879, Joseph Boehm had been chosen, apparently by Queen Victoria herself, to execute a portrait of the queen that could be used as a model for coinage designs. Boehm prepared a likeness that was used for a medal marking the queen&#x27;s Jubilee, and which was adapted for the coinage in lower relief by Leonard Charles Wyon, who made small changes.
The obverse of the Jubilee coinage, first issued in 1887, including the double florin, features that likeness. It quickly became controversial, although it was a portrait from life, as the queen had sat for Boehm. The obverse of the 1887 coins, according to the numismatic author, Howard Linecar, &quot;produced a storm of disapproval, directed particularly against the effigy of the queen. How this obverse design was passed by the queen herself is a small mystery.&quot; In their article on Boehm&#x27;s role in the Jubilee coinage, Dyer and Mark Stocker (a biographer of Boehm) agree: &quot;even though the queen&#x27;s artistic judgment was admittedly a hit and miss affair, it still seems curious that neither she nor those most closely involved had any inkling of the likely public response&quot;. The historian Sir Charles Oman deemed the Jubilee coinage, &quot;the greatest disappointment of the century.&quot;

Victoria wears a small crown, which she had bought so as not to have to wear a heavier one. It was the crown that she preferred to wear at that time, and appears on other contemporary effigies of her. According to Linecar, &quot;Place your finger over the crown, and there is nothing odd about the portrait: it is just that of a widowed lady in mourning. The disapprobation therefore turns upon the ridiculously small crown ... When she (and the public) saw herself as others saw her, did she, as many of us do, suddenly become aware that she was wearing a &#x27;hat&#x27; that did not suit her?&quot;

Simon Heffer, in his history of Britain in the decades before the First World War, stated that the engraving on the Jubilee coinage was &quot;honest and lifelike&quot;, but that Victoria &quot;looked sour, chinless and porcine, her over-sized head made all the more glaring by a crown several sizes too small being perched upon it, above a bizarre flowing head-dress&quot;. The art critic George Moore stated of the Jubilee coinage, &quot;the melting-pot will put that right one of these days&quot;. The numismatist Lawrence W. Cobb, writing in 1985, took a more nuanced view of the portrait, &quot;Wyon seems to have tried to soften the Queen&#x27;s look of age, tension and strain [on the medal], but in so doing he lost some of the strength and vigor of the Queen&#x27;s indomitable spirit. Nonetheless, even with its faults, Wyon&#x27;s portrait preserves the majesty of the Queen&#x27;s presence.&quot;

In addition to bearing the crown, Victoria&#x27;s head has a widow&#x27;s veil. Following the death of Albert, Prince Consort in 1861, she had remained in mourning, and the veil would have been black in colour. The veil descends from a widow&#x27;s cap worn under the crown. The queen has a pearl necklace and there is an earring in her visible ear. She wears the Ribbon and Star of the Order of the Garter and the badge of the Order of the Crown of India; the artist&#x27;s initials may be found on the truncation of her bust.

===Reverse and inscriptions ===

The reverse has four cruciform shields, with sceptres in the angles between them. This was based on the designs of John Roettier for the gold coinage of Charles II. The reverse designs for the florin and double florin (which are nearly identical) were described in the proclamation making them current as &quot;contained in Four Shields arranged crosswise, each shield crowned, and between the Shields Four Sceptres surmounted by Orbs, a Thistle and a Harp, and a Star of the Garter in the Centre&quot;. These constituted the arms of the United Kingdom. The shields at top and bottom are the arms of England, the one on the right that of Scotland, and on the left that of Ireland. Gertrude Rawlings wrote in 1898 that the design for the double florin is &quot;radiating kitchen pokers and tea trays&quot;.

Around the rim of the double florin are abbreviated versions of some of the queen&#x27;s titles, with the date on the reverse. The obverse legend reads (Victoria by the Grace of God) and continuing on the reverse, (Queen of the Britains, Defender of the Faith). The &quot;Britains&quot; in the legend is meant to include the colonies and other territories. Not present is , Empress of India. The act which permitted Victoria to adopt that title had forbidden her to use it within the United Kingdom, and the double florin reflects that decision. The queen wanted that title to appear on British coinage, and would get her way on the next issue, appearing beginning in 1893, after the abolition of the double florin.

Like the other designs initially issued in June 1887, that for the double florin contains no indication of the coin&#x27;s value. By 1889, even the individual depicted on the Jubilee coinage had turned against it, writing in a note, &quot;the Queen dislikes the new coinage very much, and wishes the old one could still be used and the new one gradually disused, and then a new one struck.&quot; In 1891, the Mint set up a committee to judge entries in a fresh competition. The winner, a design by Thomas Brock, was placed on the coinage beginning between 1893 and 1895, with new reverses for the surviving silver coins between the sixpence and half crown; and on them is a statement of the value.

== Production ==
===Release and controversy ===

In December 1886, Boehm succeeded in making a model of the obverse design with which he was satisfied. It was not until February 1887 that coinage dies were made, engraved by Wyon, from which pattern coins could be struck. On 24 March 1887, Fremantle submitted the obverses of at least some of the denominations for approval by Goschen and then Victoria. Although it is not clear if an obverse for the double florin was submitted at this time, there is a uniface piece showing only the reverse of the double florin in the Royal Mint&#x27;s collection that may date from this time. Victoria&#x27;s approval of Boehm&#x27;s design was accompanied by a wish that the new coins show some wording to indicate they were struck in the Jubilee year. Fremantle was unwilling to countenance something that would delay the new coinage, but Victoria was so reluctant to yield that Goschen asked Fremantle to reconsider, but he declined to do so.

On 12 May 1887, Fremantle officially announced that there would be changes to the gold and silver coinage, including the introduction of a double florin, and an Order in Council to that effect was printed in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 17 May. Later that month, the &quot;Annual Report of the Deputy Master of the Mint&quot; contained engravings of the new issue; Fremantle wrote in it of the double florin, &quot;it remains to be seen whether this handsome coin will be generally popular&quot;. Fremantle authored an article for the June number of &quot;Murray&#x27;s Magazine&quot; entitled &quot;Our New Coins and Their Pedigree&quot; in which he said of the double florin, &quot;I am not without hope that these attempts to substitute silver coins of artistic design for the somewhat commonplace currency to which we have been accustomed during the last fifty years may be favourably viewed by the public; and it is possible that the introduction of a larger piece than those which we have hitherto been in the habit of using, in the shape of the double florin, may in many ways be found useful.&quot;

&quot;The Times&quot;, discussing the new double florin, could see no reason why the coin was necessary, describing it as &quot;very heavy, very large, and very inconvenient&quot;. &quot;The Standard&quot; wrote on 19 May that &quot;there is no particular need for a four-shilling piece ... And, now that the double florin will form the middle denomination between the two shillings and the half-sovereign, probably a fresh attempt will be made to withdraw it [the half-crown] from circulation&quot;. The &quot;Belfast News Letter&quot;, writing on 23 May, stated, &quot;It is difficult to imagine what purpose the double florin will be calculated to serve; for the inconvenience of large and heavy silver coins is too great to be overlooked&quot;. The &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; wrote the same day that the double florin &quot;in all probability will have very little currency in the United Kingdom. The meaning of the coin is that it should not be a double florin, but a dollar, and as such pass current in the East, in Canada, and other countries such as the United States where dollars are used&quot;. The crown was struck for circulation for the first time in at least 40 years, but would fare little better than the double florin, though it would last a bit longer, continuing to be struck in decreasing numbers until 1902.
The Jubilee coins, including the double florin and the crown, were issued in June 1887, with the official release initially set for 21 June, the date on which the queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee was to be celebrated. Since this day had been proclaimed a bank holiday, the release date was changed to 20 June, on which date the coins were to be conveyed from the Royal Mint to the Bank of England and there used to fill orders from London banks. Provincial banks would not have the new coins until at least the 22nd, and the &quot;Dundee Courier&quot; reported that &quot;it is expected that the demand for the double florin will soon exhaust the first supply&quot;. Once the new coins were released, there was a deeply negative reaction by public and press. According to Dyer and Stocker, &quot;When the storm of condemnation erupted, Fremantle seemed genuinely taken aback at &#x27;the sad turn affairs have taken, most unexpected to me&#x27;. It was some storm: questions in Parliament, outspoken criticism from all sections of the press, derisive cartoons and doggerel in &quot;Fun&quot; and &quot;Punch&quot;, and even some unfriendly comment by John Evans in his presidential address to the Royal Numismatic Society. The coinage was seen as the worst of all worlds; poorly executed, undignified on the obverse, and inefficient in not specifying values on the reverse.&quot; According to Heffer, as Victoria&#x27;s &quot;popularity had recovered considerably among her people by 1887, there was an outcry at this less than idealised representation&quot;. The double florin was particularly criticised.

This criticism entered the House of Commons, where Goschen answered questions about the new coinage on 23 and 28 June. The chancellor told MPs that just as the public did not confuse the florin and half crown, they would not confuse the double florin and crown. The double florin&#x27;s obverse was nearly identical to that of the crown, but for the fact that the five-shilling piece carried the royal legend on the obverse that the four-shilling bore in part on either side. The two coins had different reverses. The only immediate effect of the outcry was that the sixpence, which lacked a statement of its denomination and was gilded to pass as a half sovereign, was given again its former reverse design, which stated its value.

=== Continued production and abolition ===
In December 1887, Fremantle wrote to Robert Hunt, deputy master of the Sydney branch of the Royal Mint, that the reasons for the double florin&#x27;s issuance were very complicated, and that he doubted that it would &quot;ever be in great demand&quot;. On 30 May 1888, the London correspondent of the &quot;Liverpool Mercury&quot; stated that &quot;nearly £100,000 of the double florin was produced, and nearly the whole sum has disappeared ... the double florin has not become popular. Up to this date it has failed to obtain a general currency.&quot;

There was confusion between the double florin and the crown, which gave the four-shilling piece the nickname &quot;Barmaid&#x27;s Grief&quot;, as they were said to mistake double florins for the larger coin. With only 2 mm difference between the diameters of the double florin and the crown, there is anecdotal evidence that some at public houses lost their livelihood to the &quot;Barmaid&#x27;s Ruin&quot;. &quot;The Banker&#x27;s Magazine&quot; wrote in 1890, &quot;yet few persons, even few cashiers, however experienced they may be, will readily distinguish at a glance, a crown from a double florin. They would find it, we believe, a difficult thing to be perfectly sure which coin they were dealing with unless they examined the reverse and saw whether or not the knight and the dragon [the crown&#x27;s design] was on it&quot;.

The year 1889 saw the largest number issued, both of the double florin and of the revived crown, with more than a million struck of each. This was because the government used the two large coins in pay packets for its employees, and because of an agreement it had made with the Bank of England to reimburse the bank for conveying silver coin to its branches and to provincial applicants. In March 1890, Goschen told the Commons that &quot;there can hardly be said to be any similarity between the double florin and the crown&quot; and was met with cries of &quot;Oh!&quot;, indicating disbelief. On 5 May, upon being asked if there was any consideration being given to withdrawing either the crown or the double florin, he stated that the crown was growing in popularity and, &quot;as to the four shilling piece, it is premature to come to any decision. Time alone can show what is the real use of a coin.&quot; Nevertheless, minting of the double florin ceased forever in August 1890. According to Richard Lobel in the &quot;Coincraft Standard Catalogue of English and UK Coins&quot;, &quot;this denomination, unpopular at the time of issue, lasted until 1890, when it had outlived its usefulness. The use of the Boehm portrait no doubt accelerated its demise.&quot; Sir John Craig, in his history of the Royal Mint, stated that &quot;its closeness to the 5&quot;s&quot;. piece, its size and its novelty were fatal handicaps; it was dropped ... after an issue of 2 million specimens, and the flop was so flagrant that the Mint, contrary to all its practice, took the coins back at full face value on request&quot;.

==Aftermath==

Boehm died in December 1890, and according to the art critic Marion Spielmann, who knew him well, &quot;his gentle spirit bowed in silence beneath the torrent of scornful condemnation with which his work was received&quot;, leading to his illness and death. Wyon died the following August, and the numismatist Leonard Forrer wrote in his &quot;Biographical Dictionary of Medallists&quot;, that Wyon had wanted to design the Jubilee coinage&#x27;s obverse: &quot;towards the close of his career, he underwent deep disappointment at the Government accepting Sir J.E. Boehm&#x27;s design for the obverse of the 1887 &#x27;Jubilee&#x27; coinage, and it is believed that this hastened his end.&quot;

In February 1891, Goschen appointed a Committee on the Design of Coins under the leadership of Sir John Lubbock, the Liberal MP. At its first meeting that month, the committee unanimously decided that the double florin should be discontinued. This was confirmed in a statement to the Commons by Goschen on 25 May. The committee issued its report in March 1892, and an amended version in May; both recommended that the double florin not be retained. Fremantle reiterated this in his annual report as Deputy Master of the Mint for 1892. In January 1893, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; recalled that the double florin had been universally disliked, &quot;blessing neither him who gave nor him who took&quot;. In 1895, Robert William Hanbury, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, stated in response to a parliamentary question that he did not know why the double florin had been issued, and that some great distinction should have been made between it and the crown. The double florin&#x27;s rival, the crown, continued to be issued, and considerable efforts were made to circulate it, in the hope it would displace some half sovereigns from trade, but by 1902 it was clear that the main use of the coin was to pay government wages at the dockyards, after which it immediately went back to the banks, and it was stopped.

By 1914, some 70 per cent of the issued double florins had been withdrawn, but some remained in circulation. A 1931 report for the American government mentioned the double florin as the sole obsolete coin issue circulating in Britain, and described it as &quot;rarely seen&quot;. After silver ceased to be struck for circulating coins in 1946, specimens of the double florin showed up in the Royal Mint&#x27;s silver recovery programmes in the early 1960s. Revival of the double florin was considered from time to time and may have reached the point of production of trial pieces in 1950.
The double florin was not demonetised when decimalisation of the pound occurred in 1971, and it remains legal tender for 20p (£0.20).

== Collecting ==

The series of the double florin, with only four years to collect, has become popular among collectors seeking a complete set. There are a number of varieties in the set. The original obverse and reverse were flat; a second obverse and a second reverse, each with a number of slight differences and with a slightly concave field, were instituted for some 1887 issues and were used in subsequent years. The date was originally rendered as , with a Roman numeral I, but this was modified to an Arabic 1 even before the reverse was changed. On some 1888 and 1889 coins, the second I in is rendered as an upside-down Arabic number 1. The design of the reverse was slightly enlarged for the 1890 issue. Proof coins exist for 1887, some with the first obverse and first reverse (and a Roman I), and some with the second obverse and second reverse (and an Arabic 1).

The Numismatic Guaranty Company, a coin grading service, differentiates little between the circulation-issue varieties of the double florin, in all but the highest grades, rating each (in American dollars, and as of 2022) at $15.50 (the melt value), rising to between $400 and $750 in near-pristine condition. The 1887 proof coins carry a premium over that.

<doc id="208594" wikidata="Q1344392" url="?curid=208594" title="John Warnock">
<text>John Edward Warnock (October 6, 1940 – August 19, 2023) was an American computer scientist, inventor, technology businessman, and philanthropist best known for co-founding Adobe Systems Inc., the graphics and publishing software company, with Charles Geschke in 1982. Warnock was President of Adobe for his first two years and chairman and CEO for his remaining sixteen years at the company. Although he retired as CEO in 2001, he continued to co-chair the Adobe Board of Directors with Geschke until 2017. Warnock pioneered the development of graphics, publishing, web and electronic document technologies that have revolutionized the field of publishing and visual communications.

== Early life and education ==
Warnock was born on October 6, 1940, and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. He failed mathematics in ninth grade before graduating from Olympus High School in 1958; however, Warnock went on to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and philosophy, a Doctor of Philosophy degree in electrical engineering (computer science), and an honorary degree in science, all from the University of Utah. At the University of Utah he was a member of the Gamma Beta chapter of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He also received an honorary degree from the American Film Institute. He lived in the San Francisco Bay Area with his wife Marva M. Warnock, marrying in 1965. Marva is a former partner and graphic designer at Marsh Design in Palo Alto, California, and is known not only for creating the iconic Adobe logo, but also as a designer for nonprofit organizations. They have three children.

== Career ==
Warnock is known as the creative driving force behind Adobe System&#x27;s initial software products: PostScript, Adobe Illustrator, and the PDF, and he continued to be involved in new product development throughout his career. &quot;The thing I really enjoy is the invention process. I enjoy figuring out how to do things other people don&#x27;t know how to do.&quot;

Warnock&#x27;s earliest publication and subject of his master&#x27;s thesis was his 1964 proof of a theorem solving the Jacobson radical for row-finite matrices, which was originally posed by the American mathematician Nathan Jacobson in 1956.

In his 1969 doctoral thesis, Warnock invented the Warnock algorithm for hidden surface determination in computer graphics. It works by recursive subdivision of a scene until areas are obtained that are trivial to compute. It solves the problem of rendering a complicated image by avoiding the problem. If the scene is simple enough to compute then it is rendered; otherwise it is divided into smaller parts and the process is repeated. Warnock noted that for this work he received &quot;the dubious distinction of having written the shortest doctoral thesis in University of Utah history&quot;. The Warnock algorithm solving the hidden surface problem enabled computers to render solid objects at a time when most computer renderings were only line drawings and was featured on the cover of Scientific American in 1970 with accompanying article by Ivan Sutherland.

In 1976, while Warnock worked at Evans &amp; Sutherland, a Salt Lake City–based computer graphics company, the concepts of the PostScript language were seeded. Prior to co-founding Adobe with Geschke, Warnock worked with Geschke at Xerox&#x27;s Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC), where he had started in 1978. Unable to convince Xerox management of the approach to commercialize the InterPress graphics language for controlling printing on &quot;any&quot; computer and printer, he and Geschke left Xerox to start Adobe in 1982, naming it after Adobe Creek, which ran behind both their homes. They initially hired two computer scientists (Bill Paxton and Doug Brotz) and two electronics designers (Tom Boynton and Dan Putnam) from PARC. At their new company, they developed from scratch a similar technology, PostScript, and brought it to market for Apple&#x27;s LaserWriter in 1985. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs said: &quot;When that first page came out of the LaserWriter, I was blown away...No one had seen anything like this before. I held this page up in my hand and said, ‘Who will not want that?’ I knew then, as did John, that this was going to have a profound impact.&quot; Adobe&#x27;s PostScript technology made it possible to print high-resolution text and images from a computer, revolutionizing media and making desktop publishing feasible.

In late 1986, Warnock invented Adobe Illustrator, a computer drawing program that used lines and Bézier curves to render infinitely scalable graphics. He initially developed it to automate many of the manual tasks utilized by his wife, Marva, a graphic designer. Illustrator was released in early 1987.

In the spring of 1991, Warnock outlined a system called &quot;Camelot&quot;, inventing the Portable Document Format (PDF) file-format. The goal of Camelot was to &quot;effectively capture documents from any application, send electronic versions of these documents anywhere, and view and print these documents on any machines [sic]&quot;. Warnock&#x27;s document contemplated:

The new PDF format, though, was slow to gain industry traction and Warnock noted that &quot;the industry &#x27;did not get it.

One of Adobe&#x27;s popular typefaces, Warnock, is named after him.

Warnock held twenty patents. In addition to Adobe Systems, he was or had been on the board of directors at ebrary, Hiball, Knight-Ridder, Octavo Corporation, Netscape Communications, and Salon Media Group. Warnock was a past chairman of the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose. He was on the board of trustees of the American Film Institute, the Sundance Institute and the Folger Shakespeare Library.

His hobbies included photography, skiing, web development, painting, hiking, curation of rare scientific books, and historical Native American objects.

==Philanthropy==
A strong supporter of higher education, Warnock and his wife, Marva, have supported three presidential-endowed chairs in computer science, mathematics, and fine arts at the University of Utah, and also an endowed chair in medical research at Stanford University. In 2003, Warnock and his wife donated 200,000 shares of Adobe Systems (valued at over $5.7 million) to the University of Utah as the main gift for a new engineering building. The John E. and Marva M. Warnock Engineering Building was completed in 2007 and houses the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute and the Dean of the University of Utah College of Engineering. John and Marva have also personally assisted with cataract surgeries led by Geoffrey Tabin on missions to reverse blindness in least developed countries. They endowed a chair at the Moran Eye Center, which supports work to treat preventable blindness in Utah and around the world. John was also the Founding Chairman of the Tech Museum of Innovation from 1995 to 1999.

Warnock, the commencement speaker for the University of Utah Class of 2020, advised: &quot;The rest of your life is not a spectator sport. Your job in life is to be an active player, to make the world a better place.&quot;

==Death==
Warnock died in Los Altos, California on August 19, 2023, at the age of 82, from pancreatic cancer.

==Recognition==
The recipient of numerous scientific and awards, Warnock won the Software Systems Award from the Association for Computing Machinery in 1989. In 1995 Warnock received the University of Utah Distinguished Alumnus Award and in 1999 he was inducted as a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. Warnock was awarded the Edwin H. Land Medal from the Optical Society of America in 2000. In 2002, he was made a fellow of the Computer History Museum for &quot;his accomplishments in the commercialization of desktop publishing with Chuck Geschke and for innovations in scalable type, computer graphics and printing.&quot; Oxford University&#x27;s Bodleian Library bestowed the Bodley Medal on Warnock in November 2003. In 2004, Warnock received the Lovelace Medal from the British Computer Society in London. In October 2006, Warnock—along with Adobe co-founder Charles Geschke—received the American Electronics Association&#x27;s Annual Medal of Achievement Award, being the first software executives to receive this award. In 2008, Warnock and Geschke received the Computer Entrepreneur Award from the IEEE Computer Society &quot;for inventing PostScript and PDF and helping to launch the desktop publishing revolution and change the way people engage with information and entertainment&quot;. In September 2009, Warnock and Geschke were chosen to receive the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, one of the nation&#x27;s highest honors bestowed on scientists, engineers and inventors. In 2010, Warnock and Geschke received the Marconi Prize, an honor specifically for contributions to information science and communications.

Warnock was a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. He received honorary degrees from the University of Utah, the American Film Institute, and The University of Nottingham in the UK.

<doc id="208596" wikidata="Q172061" url="?curid=208596" title="Suleiman II of the Ottoman Empire">
<text>Suleiman II ( &quot;Süleymān-i sānī&quot;; 15 April 1642 – 22 June 1691) was the sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1687 to 1691. After being brought to the throne by an armed mutiny, Suleiman and his grand vizier Fazıl Mustafa Pasha were successfully able to turn the tide of the War of the Holy League, reconquering Belgrade in 1690, as well as carrying out significant fiscal and military reforms.

==Early life==
Suleiman II was born on 15 April 1642 at Topkapı Palace in Constantinople, the son of Sultan Ibrahim and Saliha Dilaşub Sultan, a Serb woman originally named Katarina. Suleiman was only 3 months younger than his half-brother Mehmed IV, who was born on 2 January 1642. After the deposition and execution of his father in 1648, Suleiman&#x27;s half-brother Mehmed came to the throne. On 21 October 1649, Suleiman along with his brothers Mehmed and Ahmed were circumcised.

In 1651, Suleiman was confined in the &quot;Kafes&quot;, a luxurious prison for royal princes within Topkapı Palace. This was done to avoid a rebellion. He stayed there for 36 years until he took the throne in 1687.

==Reign==

Shortly before he assumed the throne, the Ottomans suffered a major defeat at the second Battle of Mohács in 1687. In 1688, Suleiman II urgently requested the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb for assistance against the rapidly advancing Austrians, during the Ottoman–Habsburg War, but most Mughal forces were engaged in the Deccan Wars and Aurangzeb ignored Suleiman&#x27;s request to commit to any formal assistance to their desperate Ottoman allies. 

The previous ban on alcohol (which was publicly flouted in Istanbul and Galata) was energized under Suleiman, where he managed to demolish several alcohol shops, but this just led to owners bringing in more alcohol. 

Suleiman II appointed Köprülü Fazıl Mustafa Pasha as his Grand Vizier in 1689, leading to the reconquest of Belgrade in 1690. Later, the threat from the Russian Empire was renewed when they joined in an alliance with other European powers, while the Ottomans had lost the support of their Crimean vassals, who were forced to defend themselves from several Russian invasions. Under Köprülü&#x27;s leadership, the Ottomans halted an Austrian advance into Serbia and crushed an uprising in Macedonia and Bulgaria until Köprülü was killed in the Battle of Slankamen by Austrian forces.

== Family ==
Suleiman II elevated six known concubines to the rank of consort, with the title of Kadin, used for the first time as a title rather than a rank.

He gave them various jewels and precious objects that belonged to Muazzez Sultan, one of her father&#x27;s Haseki Sultans. These gifts were requisitioned when Ahmed II, son of Muazzez, succeeded Suleiman II on the throne. 

The known consorts of Suleiman II were: 
*Hatice Kadın. BaşKadin (first consort).
*Behzad Kadın. She received a brooch and a diamond ring that belonged to Muazzez Sultan. 
*Süğlün Kadın. She received a pair of pearl earrings, a pair of diamonds earrings and a pendant set with 83 pearls that belonged to Muazzez Sultan.
*Şehsuvar Kadın. She received a pearl-encrusted ablution bowl and a pair of earrings that belonged to Muazzez Sultan.
*Zeyneb Kadın. She received jewelry as gift in 1691.
*İvaz Kadın. She received jewelry as gift in 1691.

Despite his six consorts, Suleiman II remained childless. It is not known whether this was due to his sterility, lack of sexual interest, or his precarious health conditions, which forced him to be bedridden for the final half of his short reign. 

==Death==
Suleiman II had fallen into a coma and was later brought to Edirne on 8 June 1691. He died on 22 June 1691 and his body was buried in Suleiman the Magnificent&#x27;s tomb at Süleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul. His brother Ahmed succeeded him as Sultan.

<doc id="208601" wikidata="Q623062" url="?curid=208601" title="USS Boxer (LHD-4)">
<text>USS &quot;Boxer&quot; (LHD-4) is a of the United States Navy. She is the sixth U.S. ship to bear the name of the original HMS &quot;Boxer&quot;, which was captured from the British during the War of 1812.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Boxer&quot; was constructed at Ingalls Shipbuilding, Pascagoula, Mississippi, launched 13 August 1993, and commissioned 11 February 1995. She immediately left for San Diego, California, via the Panama Canal. Although she had been designed to safely transit the canal, her bridge wing and other smaller components were sheared off in the transit.

After minor repairs and system checkout, &quot;Boxer&quot; deployed to the Western Pacific from 24 March 1997 to 24 September 1997, along with and , and visited many foreign ports of call. &quot;Boxer&quot; also participated in RIMPAC the following year, then on 5 December 1998 deployed again to the Western Pacific.

&quot;Boxer&quot; deployed again to the Western Pacific, Persian Gulf and Red Sea on 14 March 2001 in support of Operation Southern Watch. She visited Singapore, Thailand, Guam, Jebel Ali, Bahrain, and Jordan, returning to the United States on 14 September 2001, just days after the attacks of 11 September 2001.

In 2003, as a result of the impending war and the need for troops in Iraq, &quot;Boxer&quot; found herself deploying yet again, this time six months ahead of schedule. This was a six-month deployment in direct support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. She deployed with six other ships from San Diego on 17 January 2003: , , , , , and .

She returned to the United States on 26 July 2003. Also in 2003 she won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Pacific Fleet.

In another early deployment, to become known as a surge deployment, &quot;Boxer&quot; steamed alone from San Diego on 14 January 2004 to support the ongoing rebuilding efforts in Iraq, dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom II. She delivered equipment and supplies to Kuwaiti Naval Base in the northern Persian Gulf for the continuing support of the post-war rebuilding of Iraq. She returned home on 29 April 2004.

&quot;Boxer&quot; was deployed with the 15th MEU from her San Diego port on 13 September 2006. They arrived to Iraq in November and returned to dock in San Diego on 31 May 2007.

From 20 April 2008 to 26 June 2008, &quot;Boxer&quot; conducted a humanitarian mission in Central and South America.

===Anti-Piracy Task Force===
&quot;Boxer&quot; is designated as the flagship of Combined Task Force 151, the international anti-piracy task force pursuing pirates off the coast of Somalia.

On 10 April 2009, &quot;Boxer&quot; was en route to assist and in negotiating the release of Richard Phillips, captain of U.S. flagged container ship , who was held hostage by Somali pirates off the Horn of Africa. On 12 April 2009, Captain Phillips was freed during a US Navy assault in which three of the Somali pirates were killed, and one was captured. Captain Phillips was transported to &quot;Boxer&quot; for medical examination and rest.

Around 1 May 2009, &quot;Boxer&quot; assisted some 200 members of the German special operations unit GSG-9 in getting close to the hijacked German container ship . During the last phase of the operation, James L. Jones, the U.S. National Security Advisor, withheld final approval for the operation out of concern for the safety of the 25 sailors on board the vessel. This led to the decision by the German department of defense and the German department of the interior to abort the planned attack on the freighter for the time being and the GSG-9 unit, which is under the command of the German secretary of the interior, returned to their base of operations at the airport of Mombasa, Kenya. It was reported that the German department of defense influence and contacts to James Jones led to the U.S. decision to withdraw from the scene.

The ship returned to San Diego on 1 August 2009. During her transit of the Pacific, 69 of the sailors and marines aboard the ship contracted swine flu, forcing the cancellation of a planned &quot;Tiger Cruise&quot; from Hawaii to meet the ships for several hundred relatives and friends.

===2010–2020===
The ship, with the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit, departed San Diego on 22 February 2011 for a seven-month deployment in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Accompanying the ship on the deployment were and .

On 6 May 2016, it was reported that the U.S. staged &quot;Boxer&quot;, supported by the destroyers and off the coast of Yemen with 2,000 to 4,500 U.S. Marines of the 13th MEU in the flotilla to provide support to coalition forces in Yemen fighting AQAP militants. On 16 June 2016, &quot;Boxer&quot;, supported by amphibious warfare ships and took part in Operation Inherent Resolve; AV-8BII Harriers of the 13th MEU flying off the ship began airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq and Syria, making it the first time the U.S. Navy used ship-based aircraft from both the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf at the same time during the Operation (aircraft from the aircraft carrier began airstrikes on ISIL targets from the Mediterranean on 3 June).

On 18 July 2019, President Donald Trump stated that the ship shot down and destroyed an Iranian drone over the Strait of Hormuz. According to a statement by the President, the drone was downed after &quot;ignoring multiple stand down calls.&quot; Iranian officials rejected Trump&#x27;s statement on downing an Iranian drone and the IRGC released a video and claimed it was monitoring the ship and some other American military vessels including USS &quot;Harpers Ferry&quot;, , and by the drone on the morning of 18 July.

On 15 March 2020, it was reported that a sailor aboard, two days prior, had tested presumptive positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus at the heart of the COVID-19 pandemic, marking the first case of a coronavirus case aboard an American warship. The sailor subsequently quarantined at home. A second sailor tested positive on 17 March 2020 and also quarantined at home.

===Modernization and maintenance===
On 7 April 2020, it was reported that BAE systems had been awarded a contract from the US Navy to perform extensive modernization and maintenance to the USS Boxer, with work scheduled to commence in June 2020, and complete in around 18 months&#x27; time in December 2021. Notably, as a part of this work, the USS Boxer was updated to be able to operate with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. As of 21 July 2023, ongoing maintenance issues have prevented the ship from returning to sea. As of 25 March 2024, the Boxer was seen departing San Diego, California. The ship returned to San Diego ten days later due to mechanical problems.

<doc id="208602" wikidata="Q304299" url="?curid=208602" title="Wasp-class amphibious assault ship">
<text>The &quot;Wasp&quot;-class is a class of landing helicopter dock (LHD) amphibious assault ships operated by the United States Navy. Based on the , with modifications to operate more advanced aircraft and landing craft, the &quot;Wasp&quot;-class is capable of transporting almost the full strength of a United States Marine Corps Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), and landing them in hostile territory via landing craft or helicopters as well as providing air support via AV-8B Harrier II attack aircraft or F-35B Lightning II stealth strike-fighters. All &quot;Wasp&quot;-class ships were built by Ingalls Shipbuilding, at Pascagoula, Mississippi, with the lead ship, , commissioned on 29 July 1989. Eight &quot;Wasp&quot;-class ships were built, and , seven are in active service, as was seriously damaged by fire on 12 July 2020, and subsequently decommissioned in April 2021.

==Design==
The &quot;Wasp&quot;-class is based on the preceding design. The design was modified to allow for the operation of AV-8B Harrier II aircraft and Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) hovercraft, making the &quot;Wasp&quot; class the first ships specifically designed to operate these.

The main physical changes between the two designs are the lower placement of the ship&#x27;s bridge in the &quot;Wasp&quot; class, the relocation of the command and control facilities to inside the hull, the removal of the Mk 45 naval guns and their sponsons on the forward edge of the flight deck, and a lengthening of to carry the LCACs.

Each &quot;Wasp&quot;-class ship has a displacement of at full load, is long, has a beam of , and a draft of . For propulsion, most of the ships are fitted with two steam boilers connected to geared turbines, which deliver to the two propeller shafts. This allows the LHDs to reach speeds of , with a range of at . The last ship of the class, , was instead fitted with two General Electric LM2500 geared gas turbines. The ship&#x27;s company consists of 1,208 personnel.

===Amphibious operations===
The LHDs can support amphibious landings in two forms: by landing craft and by helicopter. In the by high well deck, the LHDs can carry three Landing Craft Air Cushion, twelve Landing Craft Mechanised, or 40 Amphibious Assault Vehicles (AAVs), with another 21 AAVs on the vehicle deck. The flight deck has nine helicopter landing spots and can operate helicopters and tiltrotors as large as the Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion and MV-22B Osprey. The size of the air combat element varies depending on the operation: a standard air combat element consists of six Harriers or six F-35B Lightning IIs and four AH-1W/Z Super Cobra/Viper attack helicopters for attack and support, twelve Ospreys and four Super Stallions for transport, and three or four Bell UH-1Y Venom utility helicopters. For a full assault, the air group can have a maximum of 22 Ospreys, while a &quot;Wasp&quot; operating in the sea control or &quot;Harrier carrier&quot; or &quot;Lightning carrier&quot; configuration carries 20 AV-8Bs or F-35Bs (though some ships of the class have operated as many as 24 Harriers), supported by 6 Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk helicopters for anti-submarine warfare. Two aircraft elevators move aircraft between the flight deck and the hangar; in order to transit the Panama Canal, these elevators need to be folded in.
Each ship is capable of hosting 1,894 personnel of the United States Marine Corps; almost the full strength of a marine expeditionary unit (MEU). A &quot;Wasp&quot;-class vessel can transport up to of cargo, and another is allocated for the MEU&#x27;s vehicles, which typically include 5 M1 Abrams battle tanks, up to 25 AAVs, 8 M198 howitzers, 68 trucks, and up to 12 other support vehicles. A six-track internal monorail system and six internal elevators are used to shift cargo from the cargo holds to landing craft in the well deck.

Each &quot;Wasp&quot;-class ship has a hospital with 64 patient beds and 6 operating rooms. An additional 536 beds can be set up in an overflow casualty ward as needed.

===Armament and sensors===

The armament of the first four &quot;Wasp&quot; class consists of two Mark 29 octuple launchers for RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missiles, two Mark 49 launchers for RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missiles, three 20 mm Phalanx CIWSs, four 25 mm Mark 38 chain gun systems, and four .50 caliber machine guns. The next four ships, , , , and , have a slightly reduced weapons outfit compared to their preceding sister ships, with one Phalanx and one Mark 38 gun removed.

Countermeasures fitted to the ships include four to six Mark 36 SRBOC chaff and decoy launchers, an AN/SLQ-25 torpedo decoy, AN/SLQ-49 chaff buoys, a Sea Gnat missile decoy, and an AN/SLQ-32 Electronic Warfare Suite.

The sensor suite fitted to each ship comprises an AN/SPS-48 or AN/SPS-52 air-search radar backed up by an AN/SPS-49 air-search radar, an SPS-67 surface search radar, an AN/URN-25 TACAN system, along with several additional radars for navigation and fire control.

==Construction==
All &quot;Wasp&quot;-class ships were built by Ingalls Shipbuilding, at Pascagoula, Mississippi. The first ship of the class, , was commissioned on 29 July 1989.

The fifth ship of the class, , was constructed through a process of modular assembly and prefitting out, which meant that the LHD was almost 75 percent complete when she was launched. &quot;Bataan&quot; was also the first LHD that was purpose built to house female crew members (as opposed to being modified after completion), with dedicated berths for up to 450 female sailors or Marines.

Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera in 2014 suggested that Japan purchase at least one &quot;Wasp&quot;-class ship to provide robust defensive amphibious capability for Japanese outer islands in the face of Chinese threats.

<doc id="208605" wikidata="Q144281" url="?curid=208605" title="Zaibatsu">
<text>is a Japanese term referring to industrial and financial vertically integrated business conglomerates in the Empire of Japan, whose influence and size allowed control over significant parts of the Japanese economy from the Meiji period to World War II. A zaibatsu&#x27;s general structure included a family-owned holding company on top, and a bank which financed the other, mostly industrial subsidiaries within them. Although the zaibatsu played an important role in the Japanese economy beginning in 1868, they especially increased in number and importance following the Russo-Japanese War, World War I, and Japan&#x27;s subsequent attempt to conquer East Asia and the Pacific Rim during the interwar period and World War II. After World War II, they were dissolved by the Allied occupation forces and succeeded by the &quot;keiretsu&quot; (groups of banks, manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors). Equivalents to the zaibatsu can still be found in other countries, such as the &quot;chaebol&quot; conglomerates of South Korea.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;zaibatsu&quot; was coined in 19th century Japan from the Sino-Japanese roots &quot;zai&quot; (&#x27;asset&#x27;, &#x27;wealth&#x27; from Middle Chinese ) and (&#x27;clique&#x27;, &#x27;group&#x27;, from Middle Chinese ). Although zaibatsu themselves existed from the 19th century, the term was not in common use until after World War I. By definition, the zaibatsu were large family-controlled vertical monopolies consisting of a holding company on top, with a wholly-owned banking subsidiary providing finance, and several industrial subsidiaries dominating specific sectors of a market, either solely or through a number of subsidiary companies.

==Significance==
The zaibatsu were the heart of economic and industrial activity within the Empire of Japan, and held great influence over Japanese national and foreign policies. The &quot;Rikken Seiyūkai&quot; political party was regarded as an extension of the Mitsui group, which also had very strong connections with the Imperial Japanese Army. Likewise, the &quot;Rikken Minseitō&quot; was connected to the Mitsubishi group, as was the Imperial Japanese Navy.

The zaibatsu were viewed with suspicion by both the right and left of the political spectrum in the 1920s and 1930s. Although the world was in the throes of a worldwide economic depression, the zaibatsu were prospering through currency speculation, maintenance of low labour costs and military procurement. Matters came to a head in the League of Blood Incident of March 1932, with the assassination of the managing director of Mitsui, after which the zaibatsu attempted to improve their public image through increased charity work.

==History and development==
The zaibatsu were at the heart of economic and industrial activity within the Empire of Japan since Japanese industrialization accelerated during the Meiji era. They held great influence over Japanese national and foreign policies which only increased following the Japanese victory over Russia in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905 and Japan&#x27;s victories over Germany during World War I. During the interwar period the zaibatsu aided Japanese militarism and benefited from the conquest of East Asia by receiving lucrative contracts.
When Japan emerged from the self-imposed, pre-Meiji era &quot;sakoku&quot; in 1867, Western countries already had very dominant and internationally significant companies. Standard Oil, Carnegie Steel Company, AT&amp;T, General Electric, Western Union, Friedrich Krupp, Thyssen, Robert Bosch GmbH, Lloyd&#x27;s of London, Reckitt &amp; Sons, and East India Company were very dominant and were the major players in international trade. The British Empire, under the leadership of the Baring family, the Rothschild family and the Guinness family, as well as Imperial Germany and other Western countries were colonizing much of the undeveloped world, and Japanese companies realized that in order to remain sovereign, they needed to develop the same methodology and mindset of Western companies, and the zaibatsu emerged.

===Big Four===
The of, in chronological order of founding, Sumitomo, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Yasuda were the most significant zaibatsu groups. Two of them, Sumitomo and Mitsui, had roots in the Edo period while Mitsubishi and Yasuda traced their origins to the Meiji Restoration. Throughout Meiji to Shōwa, the government employed their financial powers and expertise for various endeavors, including tax collection, military procurement and foreign trade.

=== New Zaibatsu ===
Beyond the Big Four, consensus is lacking as to which companies can be called zaibatsu, and which cannot. After the Russo-Japanese War, a number of so-called &quot;second-tier&quot; zaibatsu also emerged, mostly as the result of business conglomerations and the awarding of lucrative military contracts. Some more famous second-tier zaibatsu include the Ōkura, Furukawa, and Nakajima groups.

The early zaibatsu permitted some public shareholding of some subsidiary companies, but never of the top holding company or key subsidiaries.

The monopolistic business practices by the zaibatsu resulted in a closed circle of companies until Japanese industrial expansion on the Asian mainland (Manchukuo) began in the 1930s, which allowed for the rise of a number of new groups (&quot;shinko zaibatsu&quot;), including Nissan. These new zaibatsu differed from the traditional zaibatsu only in that they were not controlled by specific families, but not in terms of business practices.

===Postwar dissolution===

The zaibatsu had been viewed with some ambivalence by the Japanese military, which nationalized a significant portion of their production capability during World War II. Remaining assets were also highly damaged by destruction during the war.

Under the Allied occupation after the surrender of Japan, a partially successful attempt was made to dissolve the zaibatsu. Many of the economic advisors accompanying the SCAP administration had experience with the New Deal and were highly suspicious of monopolies and restrictive business practices, which they felt to be both inefficient, and to be a form of corporatocracy (and thus inherently anti-democratic).

During the occupation of Japan, sixteen zaibatsu were targeted for complete dissolution, and twenty-six more for reorganization after dissolution. Among the zaibatsu that were targeted for dissolution in 1947 were Asano, Furukawa, Nakajima, Nissan, Nomura, and Okura. In addition, Yasuda dissolved itself in 1946. The controlling families&#x27; assets were seized, holding companies eliminated, and interlocking directorships, essential to the old system of inter-company coordination, were outlawed. The Matsushita Electric Industrial Company (which later took the name Panasonic), while not a zaibatsu, was originally also targeted for breakup, but was saved by a petition signed by 15,000 of its union workers and their families.

However, complete dissolution of the zaibatsu was never achieved, mostly because the U.S. government rescinded the orders in an effort to reindustrialize Japan as a bulwark against communism in Asia. Zaibatsu as a whole were widely considered to be beneficial to the Japanese economy and government, and the opinions of the Japanese public, of the zaibatsu workers and management, and of the entrenched bureaucracy regarding plans for zaibatsu dissolution ranged from unenthusiastic to disapproving. Additionally, the changing politics of the occupation during the reverse course served as a crippling, if not terminal, roadblock to zaibatsu elimination.

===Modern-day influence===
Today, the influence of the zaibatsu can still be seen in the form of financial groups, institutions, and larger companies whose origins reach back to the original zaibatsu, often sharing the same original family names (for example, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation). However, some argue that the &quot;old mechanisms of financial and administrative control&quot; that zaibatsu once enjoyed have been destroyed. Despite the absence of an actual sweeping change to the existence of large industrial conglomerates in Japan, the &quot;zaibatsu&#x27;s&quot; previous vertically integrated chain of command, ending with a single family, has now widely been displaced by the horizontal relationships of association and coordination characteristic of . Keiretsu, meaning &quot;series&quot; or &quot;subsidiary&quot;, could be interpreted as being suggestive of this difference.

The term &quot;zaibatsu&quot; has been used often in books, comics, games, and films to refer to large and usually sinister Japanese corporations, often involved in shady dealings or with connections to the yakuza. This may provide a plot hook, or simply provide the background for a character from an influential Japanese family.

<text>Ingalls Shipbuilding is a shipyard located in Pascagoula, Mississippi, United States, originally established in 1938, and now part of HII. It is a leading producer of ships for the United States Navy, and, as of 2023, is the largest private employer in Mississippi.

==History==
In 1938, Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation was founded by Robert Ingersoll Ingalls Sr. (1882–1951) of Birmingham, Alabama, on the east bank of the Pascagoula River in Mississippi. Ingalls was located where the Pascagoula River runs into the Gulf of Mexico. It started out building commercial ships, including , which took part in Liberty Fleet Day on 27 September 1941. In the 1950s, Ingalls started bidding on Navy work, winning a contract in 1957 to build 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines.

Litton Industries acquired Ingalls in 1961, and in 1968, expanded its facilities to the other side of the river. Ingalls reached a high point of employment in 1977, with 27,280 workers. In April 2001, Litton was acquired by the Northrop Grumman Corporation.

On 29 August 2005, Ingalls facilities were damaged by Hurricane Katrina; most of the ships in dock and construction escaped serious harm. While shipbuilding was halted for a while due to the destruction of many buildings, most vehicles and the large overhead cranes are the same that the facility continues to operate today.

On 31 March 2011, Northrop Grumman spun off its shipbuilding sector (including Ingalls Shipbuilding) into a new corporation, Huntington Ingalls Industries.

In 2015, Ingalls Shipbuilding Company signed a contract with US Navy for new destroyers, littoral combat ships, and new landing craft. was one of the first new destroyers and was launched on 28 March. The company is also building the , , and .

On 21 March 2015, the new ship was ceremonially christened. The vessel was launched on 30 October and was commissioned in 2017.

On 27 March 2015, the shipyard received construction contracts for their next destroyers. Ingalls Shipbuilding Company was awarded a $604.3 million contract modification for building .

On 31 March 2015, the shipyard also received another contract with a $500 million fixed price to build the eighth National Security Cutter for the US Coast Guard. Most of them will be under construction until 2019. The cutters are the most advanced ships ever built for the Coast Guard.

On 30 June 2016, Ingalls Shipbuilding signed a contract with US Navy to build the U.S. Navy&#x27;s next large-deck amphibious-assault warship. The contract included planning, advanced engineering, and procurement of long-lead material, is just over $272 million. If options are exercised, the cumulative value of the contract would be $3.1 billion.

==Products==
Ingalls&#x27; primary product has been naval ships and naval projects for Egypt, Israel, and Venezuela. In the 1940s, Ingalls attempted to enter the diesel-electric locomotive market. They cataloged an extensive product line, but only one example, known as the model 4-S, was produced. It was sold to the Gulf, Mobile &amp; Ohio Railroad. Ingalls also manufactured covered hopper railroad cars in the early 1980s, producing around 4,000 units, primarily for the lease market via North American Car.

<text>Pinckney Benton Stewart Pinchback (May 10, 1837 – December 21, 1921) was an American publisher, politician, and Union Army officer who served as Governor of Louisiana from December 9, 1872 to January 13, 1873. Pinchback was the first African-American governor and the second lieutenant governor (after Oscar Dunn) in the United States. A Republican, Pinchback served as acting governor of Louisiana for 35 days, during which ten acts of Legislature became law. He was one of the most prominent African-American officeholders during and following the Reconstruction Era.

Pinchback was born free in Macon, Georgia, to Eliza Stewart and her master, William Pinchback, a white planter. His father raised the younger Pinchback and his siblings as his own children on his large plantation in Mississippi. After the death of his father in 1848, his mother took Pinchback and siblings to the free state of Ohio to ensure their continued freedom. After the start of the American Civil War, Pinchback traveled to Union-occupied New Orleans. There he raised several companies for the 1st Louisiana Native Guard, and became one of the few African-Americans commissioned as officers in the Union Army.

Pinchback remained in New Orleans after the Civil War, becoming active in Republican politics. He won election to the Louisiana State Senate in 1868 and became the president pro tempore of the state senate. He became the acting Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana following the death of Oscar Dunn in 1871 and briefly served as acting governor of Louisiana after Henry C. Warmoth was impeached. After the contested 1872 Louisiana gubernatorial election, Republican legislators elected Pinchback to the United States Senate. Due to the controversy over the 1872 elections in the state, which were challenged by white Democrats, Pinchback was never seated in Congress.

Pinchback served as a delegate to the 1879 Louisiana constitutional convention, where he helped gain support for the founding of Southern University. In a Republican federal appointment, he served as the surveyor of U.S. customs of New Orleans from 1882 to 1885. Later he worked with other leading men of color to challenge the segregation of Louisiana&#x27;s public transportation system, leading to the Supreme Court case of &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson.&quot; To escape increasing racial oppression, he moved with his family to Washington, D.C., in 1892, where they were among the elite people of color. He died there in 1921.

==Early life==
Pinckney Benton Stewart was born free in May 1837 in Macon, Bibb County, Georgia. His parents were Eliza Stewart, a former slave, and Major William Pinchback, a white planter and his mother&#x27;s former master. William Pinchback, who also had a legal white family, freed Eliza and her two surviving children in 1836; she had borne six children by that point and two had survived. She had four more children with Pinchback, all born into freedom under Georgia law because she was free.

Pinckney Stewart&#x27;s parents were of diverse ethnic origins. Eliza Stewart was classified as mulatto and had African, Cherokee, Welsh and German ancestry. William Pinchback was ethnic European-American, of Scots-Irish, Welsh and German American ancestry. Shortly after Pinckney&#x27;s birth, his father William purchased a much larger plantation in Mississippi, and he moved there with both his white and mixed-race families.

Pinckney Benton Stewart and his siblings were considered the &quot;natural&quot; (or illegitimate) children of their father, but they were brought up in relatively affluent surroundings. He treated them as his own, with privileges similar to the white children on his plantation. In 1846, Pinchback sent the nine-year-old Pinckney and his older brother Napoleon north for education at a private academy, Gilmore High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1848, when Pinckney was eleven, his father died.

Fearful that the other Pinchback relatives might try to claim her children as slaves, Eliza Stewart fled with the children to Cincinnati in the free state of Ohio. Napoleon, at 18, helped to keep the family together, but he broke down under the responsibility. At 12, Pinckney left school and began to work as a cabin boy on river and canal boats to help his family. For a while, he lived in Terre Haute, Indiana, where he worked as a hotel porter. During that time, he still identified as Pinckney B. Stewart. He did not take his father&#x27;s surname of Pinchback until after the end of the Civil War.

==Marriage and family==
In 1860, at the age of 23, Pinckney married Emily Hawthorne, a free woman of color. Like Stewart, she was &quot;practically white&quot; in appearance, meaning that she had a high proportion of European ancestors. They had six children: Pinckney Napoleon in 1863, Bismarck in 1864, Nina in 1866, and Walter Alexander in 1868. Two others died young. Pinckney named one son Bismarck because of his admiration for statesman Otto von Bismarck of Germany, whom he considered to be one of the world&#x27;s greatest men. Pinckney&#x27;s mother, Eliza Stewart, lived with Pinckney and his family from 1867 until her death in 1884.

They had a fine house in New Orleans. Usually, in the summer, the whole family traveled to Saratoga Springs, New York, a resort town in upstate, where they would stay for several weeks. Pinchback liked to gamble on the horse racing held there during the summer season.

==Military service and Civil War==
The Civil War began the following year, and Pinckney Stewart decided to fight on the side of the Union. In 1862, he made his way to New Orleans, which had just been captured by the Union Army. He raised several companies for the Union&#x27;s all-black 1st Louisiana Native Guards Regiment, which was garrisoned in the city. A minority of the men were Louisiana free men of color, part of the educated class before the war who had participated in the state militia. Most of the Guards were former slaves, who had escaped to join the Union forces and gain freedom.

Commissioned a captain, Stewart was one of the Union Army&#x27;s few commissioned officers of African-American ancestry. Like Stewart, the officers were mostly of mixed race. Most of them were drawn from the class of free people of color in New Orleans established before the war; unlike him, they were usually of colonial French and African descent. He became Company Commander of Company A, 2nd Louisiana Regiment Native Guard Infantry, made up mostly of refugee slaves. (It was later reformed as the 74th U.S. Colored Infantry Regiment, of the United States Colored Troops.)

Passed over twice for promotion and tired of the prejudice he encountered from white officers, Stewart resigned his commission in 1863. In a letter of April 30, 1863, his married sister Adeline B. Saffold wrote to him from Sidney, Ohio, urging him to follow her example and enter the white world:If I were you, Pink, I would not let my ambition die. I would seek to rise and not in that class either but I would take my position in the world as a white man as you are and let the other go for be assured of this as the other you will never get your rights. ... 

After the war, Stewart and his wife moved to Alabama.

P.B.S. Pinchback graduated in 1885 from Straight University (later renamed Straight College), which merged with New Orleans University to form Dillard University.

==Political career==

After the war in New Orleans, Stewart took his father&#x27;s surname of Pinchback. He became active in the Republican Party. The exact moment Pinchback decided to enter politics is described by George Devol in his book &quot;Forty Years a Gambler on the Mississippi.&quot; In 1867, Pinchback organized the Fourth Ward Republican Club in New Orleans soon after Congress passed the Reconstruction Acts. That year, he was elected as a delegate to the constitutional convention.

In 1868 Pinchback was elected as a State Senator. He was elected as senate president &quot;pro tempore&quot;; seven of 36 seats in the Senate were held by men of color. The House had 42 representatives of African-American descent, comprising half the seats. (At the time, the populations of African Americans, including former free people of color, and whites in the state were nearly equal.)

As Senate president pro tempore, in 1871, Pinchback succeeded to the position of acting lieutenant governor upon the death of Oscar Dunn, the first elected African-American lieutenant governor of a US state.

Pinchback contributed further to the political discussion with the founding of the bi-weekly newspaper, the &quot;Louisianian&quot; in 1870. He worked as an editor there until 1872. Later, in 1874, he returned to be editor and in 1878 he became editor-in-chief, though he allowed students from Straight University (later part of Dillard University). The paper&#x27;s motto was &quot;Republican at all times, and under all circumstances.&quot; Publication of the paper ended in 1882.

He was appointed as director of the New Orleans public schools. Statewide public schools were established for the first time by the new state legislature during Reconstruction. Pinchback had a long-standing interest in education of blacks and was appointed to the Louisiana State Board of Education, where he served from March 18, 1871, until March, 1877.

===Ascension to Governorship===
In 1872, the legislature filed impeachment charges against the incumbent Republican governor, Henry Clay Warmoth, over disputes over certifying returns of the disputed gubernatorial election, in which both Democrat John McEnery and Republican William Kellogg claimed victory. Trying to support a centrist fusion government at a time of divisions among Republicans, Warmoth had supported his appointed return board, which certified McEnery as winner. Republicans opposed this outcome and appointed their own returns board, which certified Kellogg. The election had been marked by violence and fraud.
Pinchback rose to acting governor in Warmoth&#x27;s stead by way of article 53 of the Louisiana Constitution of 1868, which held that the lieutenant governor would assume the duties of the governor &quot;in case of impeachment of the Governor, his removal from office, death . . . resignation or absence from the state.&quot; Pinchback was sworn in as the first governor of African descent in the history of the United States. He took the oath as acting governor on December 9, 1872, and served for about six weeks, until the end of Warmoth&#x27;s term. No trial was held, and after his term ended all charges were expunged.

Also in 1872, at a national convention of African-American politicians, Pinchback had a public disagreement with Jeremiah Haralson of Alabama. James T. Rapier, also of Alabama, submitted a motion that the convention condemn all Republicans who had opposed President Ulysses S. Grant in that year&#x27;s election. Haralson supported the motion, but Pinchback opposed it because Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts would have been condemned for opposing Grant. Pinchback admired Sumner as a lifelong anti-slavery fighter.

===1870s congressional elections===
After his brief period in executive office, Pinchback remained active in politics and public service in Louisiana. From 1868, campaigns and elections in Louisiana were increasingly marked by Democratic violence. Historian George C. Rable described the White League, a paramilitary group started in 1874, as the &quot;military arm of the Democratic Party.&quot; The paramilitary group used intimidation and violence to suppress black voting and run Republicans out of office.

As an outcome of the controversial 1872 election, four U.S. seats from Louisiana were also contested, including Pinchback&#x27;s seat in the at-large position. In early 1873, both the Republican William Kellogg-allied state legislators, who had a minor majority, and the Democrat John McEnery-allied legislators elected U.S. Senators. Pinchback was elected by the Republicans and presented the Senate with his credentials. The Democratic candidate also presented credentials. As the 1872 gubernatorial contest had involved the national government, Congress was initially reluctant to assess these issues. The contested claim was not settled for years, at a time when Democrats controlled Congress.

Holding out for the Senate seat, Pinchback decided not to take the House seat even though Congress was inclined to seat him while the contest of the election was decided. The 45th Congress (1877–1879), which finally decided the issue, had a Democratic majority and voted against Pinchback. The Senate awarded him compensation of $16,000 for his salary and mileage after his protracted struggle to take his seat. The House also ruled against him, but not until the last day of Congress.

In his memoir of Reconstruction, former Louisiana governor Henry Clay Warmoth wrote that the federal government was reluctant to seat people representing the Kellogg-Pinchback faction. He had a personal interest, as he had been forced out of Louisiana after allying with white conservatives in the 1872 election certification. Historian John C. Rodrigue notes that the Committee on Elections was dealing with its own internal issues. It had accepted Pinchback&#x27;s claim to the House seat, but he was holding out for the Senate seat. Complications arose after the Democrats took control of the next Congress and upheld election of his opponent.

Overall, the mid-to-late 1870s marked an acceleration of the reversal of the political gains that African Americans in Louisiana had achieved since the end of the Civil War. In 1877, Democrats fully regained control of the state legislature after the withdrawal of federal troops, as a result of a national Democratic compromise marking the end of Reconstruction. Republican blacks continued to be elected to state and local offices, but elections were accompanied by violence and fraud. Most blacks were totally disfranchised by a new state constitution in 1898 and were effectively excluded from politics for decades.

Pinchback served as a delegate to the 1879 state constitutional convention; he and two other Republican African-American delegates, Theophile T. Allain, and Henry Demas, were credited with gaining support to establish Southern University, a historically black college in New Orleans, which was chartered in 1880. Pinchback was appointed as a member of Southern University&#x27;s board of trustees (later redesignated the board of supervisors). The college relocated to the capital, Baton Rouge, in 1914. At the 1876 Republican National Convention in Cincinnati, Pinchback gave a speech seconding the nomination of Oliver P. Morton for the presidency. Pinchback was a delegate to the 1880 Republican National Convention.

In 1882, the national Republican administration appointed Pinchback as surveyor of customs in New Orleans, a politically significant position in which he served until 1885. It was his last political position.

==Later life==
In 1885, Pinchback studied law in New Orleans at Straight University, a historically black college later known as Dillard University. He was admitted to the Louisiana bar in 1886, but he never practiced.

Pinchback moved with his family to Washington, D.C., in 1892. Wealthy from his positions and settlement on the Senate seat, he had a large mansion built off Fourteenth Street near the Chinese embassy. At the time, his oldest son, Pinckney Pinchback, was established as a pharmacist in Philadelphia; the younger three ranged in age from 22 to 26 and were still living at home. The Pinchback family was part of the mixed-race elite in Washington; people in the group had generally been free before the Civil War and often were educated and had acquired property. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; covered Pinchback&#x27;s housewarming reception and his many high-ranking guests.

Later, Pinchback worked for a time in New York as a U.S. Marshal.

By his death in 1921 in Washington, D.C., Pinchback was little known politically. His body was returned to New Orleans, where he was interred in Metairie Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Pinchback and his wife Nina were the maternal grandparents of Jean Toomer. Their daughter Nina Pinchback Toomer returned to live with her parents after her husband abandoned her when Jean was an infant. They helped raise him, and he started school in Washington, D.C.. After his mother remarried, they moved to New Rochelle, New York. He returned to his grandparents after his mother died in 1909, and went to high school at the academic M Street School. As an adult, Toomer became a poet and writer who was prominent as a modernist in New York during the Harlem Renaissance.

<text>Rattan, also spelled ratan (from Malay: &quot;rotan&quot;), is the name for roughly 600 species of Old World climbing palms belonging to subfamily Calamoideae. The greatest diversity of rattan palm species and genera are in the closed-canopy old-growth tropical forests of Southeast Asia, though they can also be found in other parts of tropical Asia and Africa. Most rattan palms are ecologically considered lianas due to their climbing habits, unlike other palm species. A few species also have tree-like or shrub-like habits.

Around 20% of rattan palm species are economically important and are traditionally used in Southeast Asia in producing wickerwork furniture, baskets, canes, woven mats, cordage, and other handicrafts. Rattan canes are one of the world&#x27;s most valuable non-timber forest products. Some species of rattan also have edible scaly fruit and heart of palm. Despite increasing attempts in the last 30 years at commercial cultivation, almost all rattan products still come from wild-harvested plants. Rattan supplies are now rapidly threatened due to deforestation and overexploitation. Rattan were also historically known as Manila cane or Malacca cane, based on their trade origins, as well as numerous other trade names for individual species.

== Description ==

Most rattan palms are classified ecologically as lianas because most mature rattan palms have a vine-like habit, scrambling through and over other vegetation. However, they are different from true woody lianas in several ways. Because rattans are palms, they do not branch and they rarely develop new root structures upon contact of the stem with soil. They are monocots, and thus, do not exhibit secondary growth. This means the diameter of the rattan stem is always constant: juvenile rattan palms have the same width as when adult, usually around in diameter, with long internodes between the leaves. This also means juvenile rattan palms are rigid enough to remain free-standing, unlike true lianas which always need structural support, even when young. Many rattans also have spines which act as hooks to aid climbing over other plants, and to deter herbivores. The spines also give rattans the ability to climb wide-diameter trees, unlike other vines which use tendrils or twining which can only climb narrower supports. Rattans have been known to grow up to hundreds of metres long. 
A few species of rattans are non-climbing. These range from free-standing tree-like species (like &quot;Calamus dumetosa&quot;) to acaulescent shrub-like species with short subterranean stems (like &quot;Calamus pygmaeus&quot;).

Rattans can also be solitary (single-stemmed), clustering (clump-forming), or both. Solitary rattan species grow into a single stem. Clustering rattan, on the other hand, develop clumps of up to 50 stems via suckers, similar to bamboo and bananas. These clusters can produce new stems continually as individual stems die. The impact of harvesting is much greater in solitary species, since the whole plant dies when harvested. An example of a commercially important single-stemmed species is &quot;Calamus manan&quot;. Clustering species, on the other hand, have more potential to become sustainable if the rate of harvesting does not exceed the rate of stem replacement via vegetative reproduction.

Rattans display two types of flowering: hapaxanthy and pleonanthy. All the species of the genera &quot;Korthalsia&quot;, &quot;Laccosperma&quot;, &quot;Plectocomia&quot;, &quot;Plectocomiopsis&quot;, and &quot;Myrialepis&quot; are hapaxanthic; as well as a few species of &quot;Calamus&quot;. This means they only flower and fruit once then die. All other rattan species are pleonanthic, being able to flower and fruit continually. Most commercially harvested species are pleonanthic, because hapaxanthic rattans tend to have soft piths making them unsuitable for bending.

== Taxonomy ==

Calamoideae includes tree palms such as &quot;Raffia&quot; (raphia) and &quot;Metroxylon&quot; (sago palm) and shrub palms such as &quot;Salacca&quot; (salak) (Uhl &amp; Dransfield 1987 &quot;Genera Palmarum&quot;). The climbing habit in palms is not restricted to Calamoideae, but has also evolved in three other evolutionary lines—tribes Cocoseae (&quot;Desmoncus&quot; with c. 7–10 species in the New World tropics) and Areceae (&quot;Dypsis scandens&quot; in Madagascar) in subfamily Arecoideae, and tribe Hyophorbeae (climbing species of the large genus &quot;Chamaedorea&quot; in Central America) in subfamily Ceroxyloideae. They do not have spinose stems and climb by means of their reflexed terminal leaflets. Of these only &quot;Desmoncus&quot; spp. furnish stems of sufficiently good quality to be used as rattan cane substitutes.

There are 13 different genera of rattans that include around 600 species. Some of the species in these &quot;rattan genera&quot; have a different habit and do not climb, they are shrubby palms of the forest undergrowth; nevertheless they are close relatives to species that are climbers and they are hence included in the same genera. The largest rattan genus is &quot;Calamus&quot;, distributed in Asia except for one species represented in Africa. From the remaining rattan genera, &quot;Korthalsia&quot;, &quot;Plectocomia&quot;, &quot;Plectocomiopsis&quot;, and &quot;Myrialepis&quot; are centered in Southeast Asia with outliers eastwards and northwards; and three are endemic to Africa: &quot;Laccosperma&quot; (syn. &quot;Ancistrophyllum&quot;), &quot;Eremospatha&quot; and &quot;Oncocalamus&quot;.

Other traditional uses of rattans by species:

=== Etymology ===
The name &quot;rattan&quot; is first attested in English in the 1650s. It is derived from the Malay name &quot;rotan&quot;. Probably ultimately from &quot;rautan&quot; (from &quot;raut&quot;, &quot;to trim&quot; or &quot;to pare&quot;).

== Ecology ==
Many rattan species also form mutualistic relationships with ant species. They provide ant shelters (myrmecodomatia) like hollow spines, funnel-shaped leaves, or leaf sheath extensions (ochreae). The rattans in turn, gain protection from herbivores.

== Conservation ==
Rattans are threatened with overexploitation, as harvesters are cutting stems too young and reducing their ability to resprout. Unsustainable harvesting of rattan can lead to forest degradation, affecting overall forest ecosystem services. Processing can also be polluting. The use of toxic chemicals and petrol in the processing of rattan affects soil, air and water resources, and also ultimately people&#x27;s health. Meanwhile, the conventional method of rattan production is threatening the plant&#x27;s long-term supply, and the income of workers.

Rattans also exhibit rapid population growths in disturbed forest edges due to higher light availability than in the closed-canopy old-growth tropical forests. Although this can mean increased rattan abundance for economic exploitation, it can also be problematic in long-term conservation efforts.

Rattan harvesting from the wild in most rattan-producing countries requires permits. These include the Philippines, Sri Lanka, India, Malaysia, Laos, Ghana, and Cameroon. In addition, the Philippines also imposes an annual allowable cut in an effort to conserve rattan resources. Rattan cultivation (both monoculture and intercropping) is also being researched and pioneered in some countries, though it is still a young industry and only constitutes a minority of the rattan resources harvested annually.

== Uses ==

In forests where rattan grows, its economic value can play a crucial role in conservation efforts. By offering an alternative source of income, rattan harvesting can deter loggers from engaging in timber logging. Harvesting rattan canes is simpler and requires less sophisticated tools compared to logging operations. Furthermore, rattan grows rapidly, which facilitates quicker replenishment compared to tropical wood species.This economic incentive supports forest maintenance by providing a profitable crop that complements rather than competes with trees. However, the long-term profitability and utility of rattan compared to other alternatives remain subjects of ongoing evaluation and study.

Cleaned rattan stems with the leaf sheaths removed are superficially similar to bamboo. Unlike bamboo, rattan stems are not hollow. Most (70%) of the world&#x27;s rattan population exists in Indonesia, distributed among the islands Borneo, Sulawesi, and Sumbawa. The rest of the world&#x27;s supply comes from the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Assam, India. 

=== Food source ===

Some rattan fruits are edible, with a sour taste akin to citrus. The fruit of some rattans exudes a red resin called dragon&#x27;s blood; this resin was thought to have medicinal properties in antiquity and was used as a dye for violins, among other things. The resin normally results in a wood with a light peach hue.

The stem tips are rich in starch, and can be eaten raw or roasted. Long stems can be cut to obtain potable water. The palm heart can also be eaten raw or cooked.

=== Medicinal potential ===
In early 2010, scientists in Italy announced that rattan wood would be used in a new &quot;wood to bone&quot; process for the production of artificial bone. The process takes small pieces of rattan and places them in a furnace. Calcium and carbon are added. The wood is then further heated under intense pressure in another oven-like machine, and a phosphate solution is introduced. This process produces almost an exact replica of bone material. The process takes about 10 days. At the time of the announcement the bone was being tested in sheep, and there had been no signs of rejection. Particles from the sheep&#x27;s bodies have migrated to the &quot;wood bone&quot; and formed long, continuous bones. The new bone-from-wood programme is being funded by the European Union. By 2023, experimental implants into humans were taking place.

=== Rattan chair ===

Rattans are extensively used for making baskets and furniture. When cut into sections, rattan can be used as wood to make furniture. Rattan accepts paints and stains like many other kinds of wood, so it is available in many colours, and it can be worked into many styles. Moreover, the inner core can be separated and worked into wicker. A typical braiding pattern is called &quot;Wiener Geflecht&quot;, Viennese Braiding, as it was invented in 18th century Vienna and later most prominently used by Thonet for their No. 14 chair. 

Generally, raw rattan is processed into several products to be used as materials in furniture making. From a strand of rattan, the skin is usually peeled off, to be used as rattan weaving material. The remaining &quot;core&quot; of the rattan can be used for various purposes in furniture making. Rattan is a very good material, mainly because it is lightweight, durable, and, to a certain extent, flexible and suitable for outdoor use.

===Clothing===
Traditionally, the women of the Wemale ethnic group of Seram Island, Indonesia wore rattan girdles around their waist.

=== Corporal punishment ===

Thin rattan canes were the standard implement for school corporal punishment in England and Wales, and are still used for this purpose in schools in Malaysia, Singapore, and several African countries. The usual maximum number of strokes was six, traditionally referred to as getting &quot;Six of the best&quot;. Similar canes are used for military punishments in the Singapore Armed Forces. Heavier canes, also of rattan, are used for judicial corporal punishments in Aceh, Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore.

=== Wicks ===
Rattan is the preferred natural material used to wick essential oils in aroma reed diffusers (commonly used in aromatherapy, or merely to scent closets, passageways, and rooms), because each rattan reed contains 20 or more permeable channels that wick the oil from the container up the stem and release fragrance into the air, through an evaporation diffusion process. In contrast, reeds made from bamboo contain nodes that inhibit the passage of essential oils.

=== Handicraft and arts ===
Many of the properties of rattan that make it suitable for furniture also make it a popular choice for handicraft and art pieces. Uses include rattan baskets, plant containers, and other decorative works.

Due to its durability and resistance to splintering, sections of rattan can be used as canes, crooks for high-end umbrellas, or staves for martial arts. Rattan sticks long, called &quot;baston&quot;, are used in Filipino martial arts, especially Arnis/Eskrima/Kali and for the striking weapons in the Society for Creative Anachronism&#x27;s full-contact &quot;armoured combat&quot;.

Along with birch and bamboo, rattan is a common material used for the handles in percussion mallets, especially mallets for keyboard percussion, &quot;e.g.&quot;, marimba, vibraphone, xylophone, etc.

=== Shelter material ===
Most natives or locals from the rattan rich countries employ the aid of this sturdy plant in their home building projects. It is heavily used as a housing material in rural areas. The skin of the plant or wood is primarily used for weaving.

===Sports equipment===
Rattan cane is also used traditionally to make polo mallets, though only a small portion of cane harvested (roughly 3%) is strong, flexible, and durable enough to be made into sticks for polo mallets, and popularity of rattan mallets is waning next the more modern variant, fibrecanes.

===Weaponry===

Fire-hardened rattan were commonly used as the shafts of Philippine spears collectively known as &quot;sibat&quot;. They were fitted with a variety of iron spearheads and ranged from short throwing versions to heavy thrusting weapons. They were used for hunting, fishing, or warfare (both land and naval warfare). The rattan shafts of war spears are usually elaborately ornamented with carvings and metal inlays. Arnis also makes prominent use of rattan as &quot;arnis sticks&quot;, commonly called &quot;yantok&quot; or &quot;baston&quot;. Their durability and weight makes it ideal for training with complex execution of techniques as well as being a choice of weapon, even against bladed objects.

Rattan shields were historically used in ancient, medieval and early modern China and Korea. According to some contemporary sources, they were reasonably effective against both arrows and early firearms. 

It sees also prominent use in battle re-enactments as stand-ins to potentially lethal weapons.

Rattan can also be used to build a functional sword that delivers a non-lethal but similar impact compared to steel counterparts.

<text>The Cataraqui River ( ) forms the lower portion of the Rideau Canal and drains into Lake Ontario at Kingston, Ontario. The name is taken from the original name for Kingston, Ontario; its exact meaning, however, is undetermined. Early maps showed several name variations including the Great Cataraqui River and Grand River Cataraquay. The river was once called Riviere de Frontenac, or Frontenac River. The alternate spelling &quot;Cadaraqui&quot; also appears in some historic texts.

Prior to the Rideau Canal being built (1826 – 1832), the Cataraqui River had its headwaters in Dog and Loughborough lakes. It was a meandering creek, a 1795 map (by surveyor Lewis Grant) noted &quot;a great number of rapids and Carrying Places on this creek.&quot; This changed with the building of the Rideau Canal. The Superintending Engineer of the project, Lt. Colonel John By, used a slackwater construction technique, building dams to drown rapids. In the area of the Cataraqui Creek from Upper Brewers to Kingston Mills he had the forests cut down to form a straight channel (this work is visible in the Burrowes paintings of Brewer&#x27;s Lower Mill shown below). The area was then flooded in late 1831/early 1832 with the completion of canal dams at Kingston Mills, Lower Brewers and Upper Brewers.

Today the watershed of the Cataraqui River includes lakes south of the watershed divide at Newboro, such as Sand, Opinicon, Clear and Newboro. However, in the pre-canal era, water from those lakes flowed into the White Fish River which drained to the Gananoque River rather than the Cataraqui River. The section between those two rivers was the Cranberry Flood Plain; the only water contribution from the White Fish River to the Cataraqui was in times of spring flood. This changed in the early 1800s with the building of a mill dam by Lemuel Haskins at White Fish Falls, near today&#x27;s village of Morton. That dam retarded the outflow of the White Fish River to the Gananoque, backed it up over the Cranberry Flood Plain, sending water south to the Cataraqui River. To stop the escape of his mill water down Cataraqui Creek, Haskins built a second dam at the Round Tail (just north of Upper Brewers) which blocked the channel of the creek. These two dams made the Cataraqui Flood Plain navigable for the first time.

When the Rideau Canal was built, Haskins&#x27; dam at Morton was enlarged and a new dam was built at Upper Brewers. Those two dams (managed today by Parks Canada) created Whitefish Lake, Little Cranberry Lake and much expanded Cranberry and Dog lakes. Most of the flow from what was previously the White Fish River watershed now flows down the Cataraqui River.

The Cataraqui Region Conservation Authority administers water management concerns within the Cataraqui River watershed.

is a town in Rostov Oblast, Russia, situated on the Don River just from the Sea of Azov, which derives its name from the town. The population is 

==History==

===Early settlements in the vicinity===
The mouth of the Don River has always been an important commercial center. At the start of the 3rd century BCE, the Greeks from the Bosporan Kingdom founded a colony here, which they called &quot;Tanais&quot; (after the Greek name of the river). Several centuries later, in the last third of 1st century BCE, the settlement was burned down by king Polemon I of Pontus. The introduction of Greek colonists restored its prosperity, but the Goths practically annihilated it in the 3rd century. The site of ancient Tanais, now occupied by the &quot;khutor&quot; of Nedvigovka, has been excavated since the mid-19th century.

In the 5th century, the area was populated by Karadach and his Akatziroi. They were ruled by Dengizich the Hun. Byzantium gave the land to the Hunugurs in the 460s; it became known as Patria Onoguria under his brother, Ernakh. Its Hun inhabitants became known as the Utigur Bulgars when it became part of the Western Turkic Kaghanate under Sandilch. Then in the 7th century Khan Kubrat, ruler of the Unogundurs established Old Great Bolgary there before his heir Batbayan surrendered it to the Khazars.

In the 10th century, as the Khazar state disintegrated, the area came under the control of the Slavic princedom of Tmutarakan. The Kipchaks, seizing the area in 1067, renamed it Azaq (i.e., lowlands), from which appellation the modern name is derived. The Golden Horde claimed most of the coast in the 13th and 14th centuries, but the Venetian and Genoese merchants were granted permission to settle on the site of modern-day Azov and founded there a colony which they called .

===Archaeological digs===
In autumn 2000, Thor Heyerdahl wanted to further investigate his idea that Scandinavians may have migrated from the south via waterways. He sought the origin of Odin (Wotan), the Germanic and Nordic god of the mythologies of the early Norse Eddas and Sagas. According to Snorri Sturluson, the Icelandic author of an Edda and at least one Saga, who wrote in the 13th century, Odin was supposed to have migrated from the region of the Caucasus or the area just east of the Black Sea near the turn of the 1st century CE. Heyerdahl was particularly interested in Snorri&#x27;s reference to the land of origin of the Æsir people. Heyerdahl wanted to test the veracity of Snorri&#x27;s claims and as a result, organized the Joint Archaeological Excavation in Azov in 2001. He had wanted to undertake a second excavation the following year, but it never happened due to his death in April 2002.

==Fortress==


In 1471, the Ottoman Empire gained control of the area and built the strong fortress of Azak (Azov). The fort blocked the Don Cossacks from raiding and trading in the Black Sea. The Cossacks attacked Azov in 1574, 1593, 1620, and 1626. In April 1637, three thousand Don Cossacks and four thousand Zaporozhian Cossacks besieged Azov. The Turks had four thousand soldiers and two hundred cannons. The fort fell on June 21 and the Cossacks sent a request to the Tsar for re-enforcements and support. A commission recommended against this because of the danger of war with Turkey and the poor state of the fortifications. In June 1641, Hussein Deli, Pasha of Silistria, invested the fort with 70,000–80,000 men. In September, they had to withdraw because of disease and provisioning shortfalls. A second Russian commission reported that the siege had left very little of the walls. In March 1642, Sultan Ibrahim issued an ultimatum and Tsar Mikhail ordered the Cossacks to evacuate. The Turks reoccupied Azov in September 1642.

In 1693, the garrison of the fortress was 3,656 of whom 2,272 were Janissaries.

The fortress, however, had yet to pass through many vicissitudes. During the Azov campaigns of 1696, Peter the Great, who desired naval access to the Black Sea, managed to recover the fortress. Azov was granted town status in 1708, but the disastrous Pruth River Campaign constrained him to hand it back to the Turks in 1711. A humorous description of the events is featured in Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot;. During the Great Russo-Turkish War, it was taken by the army under Count Rumyantsev and finally ceded to Russia under the terms of Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji (1774). For seven years Azov was a seat of its own governorate, but with the growth of neighboring Rostov-on-the-Don it gradually declined in importance. The Germans and Austrians occupied Azov in 1917–1918, during World War I. It was occupied by the Germans between July 1942 and February 1943 during World War II.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Azov serves as the administrative center of Azovsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as Azov Urban Okrug—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, this administrative unit also has urban okrug status.

==Government==
Sergey Bezdolny of the United Russia party was elected Mayor of Azov on April 3, 2005 and re-elected on October 11, 2009 by 72.9% of the voters.
The current head of administration (city-manager) Vladimir Rashchupkin holds office from December 2015.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Azov&#x27;s climate is humid continental (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfa&quot;), featuring hot summers, cold winters (though quite mild for Russia), and fairly low precipitation.
==Attractions==
There are many monuments and museums in Azov.
Built in 1799, the Powder Cellar Museum in Azov is the only remaining fortress of Catherine&#x27;s time in all of what was once southern Russia. Fortresses she built in Rostov, Taganrog and elsewhere have been completely destroyed, so Azov&#x27;s deserves to be considered an architectural monument to the art of military engineering in the 18th century. A wooden cellar served a quarter century, but in 1797 had become dilapidated, so it was dismantled, and replaced with a cellar made of stone. In 1799, in the bastion of St. Anne, a new powder cellar was built. From the beginning of the 19th to the 20th century the cellar was used to store of ice. From 1961 to 1965 the cellar was renovated and handed over to the Azov Museum of History, Archaeology and Palaeontology.

In 1967, to celebrate the 900-year anniversary of Azov, Soviet officials opened the exposition diorama
&quot;The taking of Azov by the troops of Peter the Great in 1696.&quot; The author of the diorama was the Russian artist Arseniy Chernyshov.

The Azov Fortress is a fortified complex overlooking the Don River and the Port of Azov to the north. It includes a rampart, watchtowers and gates.

Monument to Peter I is a bronze monument of Peter the Great in the center of Azov. It was designed by sculptors Oleg Komov and Andrey Kovalchuk. The opening ceremony took place on 19 July 1996 and was held in conjunction by the 300-year anniversary of the Russian Navy.

Monument to Aleksei Shein is a sculpture of Russian statesman, general, Boyar (from 1695), and the first Russian Generalissimo (1696) Aleksei Semenovich Shein. The monument was opened on June 12, 2009. The authors of the project were M. Lushnikov and V.P. Mokrousov.

Monument to the sailors of the Azov Flotilla is dedicated to the Flotilla, which heroically fought in Taganrog Bay and the Don Delta during the Great Patriotic War. The monument is considered to be an object of local cultural heritage.

The Azov Museum of History, Archaeology and Palaeontology is one of the biggest southern museums of Russia hosting the richest palaeontological collection in the south of Russia. The museum was established on 17 May 1917 by Michail Aronovich Makarovskiy. There is the House of Kovalev opposite the museum.

<doc id="208623" wikidata="Q199481" url="?curid=208623" title="Mahmud I">
<text>Mahmud I (, ; 2 August 1696 13 December 1754), known as Mahmud the Hunchback, was the sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1730 to 1754. He took over the throne after the quelling of the Patrona Halil rebellion. His reign was marked by wars in Persia and conflicts in Europe. He delegated government affairs to his viziers and devoted time to writing poetry. Nader Shah&#x27;s devastating campaign weakened the Mughal Empire and created the opportunity for Mahmud I to initiate war with cooperation from Muhammad Shah. The alliance ended with the latter&#x27;s death, leading to tensions between the Afsharids and the Ottomans. In 1748, he outlawed Freemasonry within the Ottoman Empire.

==Early life==
He was born at Edirne Palace on 2 August 1696, the son of Mustafa II (1664–1703); his mother was Saliha Sultan. Mahmud I was the older half-brother of Osman III (1754–57). He developed a humped back.

His father Mustafa II mostly lived in Edirne. Mahmud passed his childhood in Edirne. On 18 May 1702 he started his education in Edirne. When his father deposed himself from the throne he was brought to Istanbul and locked up in Kafes where he spent 27 years of his life.

It is not known what kind of culture he acquired during this time, since he continued to play chess, write poetry, and deal with music. In addition for childhood and youth, there were dangers, especially for the Kafes life.

==Reign==
===Accession===
On 28 September 1730, Patrona Halil with a small group of fellow Janissaries aroused some of the citizens of Constantinople who opposed the reforms of Ahmed III. Sweeping up more soldiers Halil led the riot to the Topkapı Palace and demanded the death of the grand vizer, Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha and the abdication of Ahmed III. Ahmed III acceded to the demands, had İbrahim Pasha strangled, and agreed to his nephew, Mahmud, becoming sultan.

Mahmud&#x27;s real reign began on 25 November 1730, after this incident. First of all, Istanbul was taken under strict control. Measures were taken. About two thousand suspicious people were captured, some were executed, some were exiled.

===Mahmud&#x27;s rule===
Mahmud I was recognized as sultan by the mutineers as well as by court officials but for some weeks after his accession the empire was in the hands of the insurgents. Halil rode with the new sultan to the Mosque of Eyüb where the ceremony of girding Mahmud I with the Sword of Osman was performed; many of the chief officers were deposed and successors to them appointed at the dictation of the bold rebel who had served in the ranks of the Janissaries and who appeared before the sultan bare-legged and in his old uniform of a common soldier. A Greek butcher, named Yanaki, had formerly given credit to Halil and had lent him money during the three days of the insurrection. Halil showed his gratitude by compelling the Divan to make Yanaki Hospodar of Moldavia. However, Yanaki never took charge of this office.

The Khan of the Crimea assisted the Grand Vizier, the Mufti and the Aga of the Janissaries in putting down the rebellion. On 24 November 1731, Halil was strangled by the sultan&#x27;s order and in his presence, after a Divan in which Halil had dictated that war be declared against Russia. His Greek friend, Yanaki, and 7,000 of those who had supported him were also put to death. The jealousy which the officers of the Janissaries felt towards Halil, and their readiness to aid in his destruction, facilitated the exertions of Mahmud I&#x27;s supporters in putting an end to the rebellion after it had lasted over a year.

The Austrian ambassador, who came to Istanbul in August 1740, was given a dinner in Davudpaşa. Çavuşbaşı took the ambassador and took him to his mansion prepared in Beyoğlu. On the day of the Ulufe Court, he presented his name to the Sultan. Various demonstrations were held in places where welcome and farewell ceremonies were held for the ambassador from Yeniköy Pier.

The rest of Mahmud I&#x27;s reign was dominated by wars in Persia, with the collapsing Safavid dynasty and the ascendance of Nader Shah. Mahmud also faced a notable war in Europe—the Austro-Russian-Turkish War (1735–1739).

After the condemnation of Freemasonry by Pope Clement XII in 1738, he followed suit outlawing the organization and since that time Freemasonry was equated with atheism in the Ottoman Empire and the broader Islamic world.

Mahmud I entrusted government to his viziers and spent much of his time composing poetry.

===Fires of 1750===
The fire that started at the Ayazma gate in January 1750 lasted for 19 hours. Numerous shops, houses, and mansions burned until the fire reached Vefa district. The sultan dismissed Boynueğri Abdullah Pasha and appointed Divitdar Mehmed Emin Pasha on 9 January 1750. In the second fire that broke out on 31 March 1750, Bitpazan, Abacılar, Yorgancılar, Yağlıkcılar, Haffaflar were completely burned. The fire spread to Fingerkapi and Tatlikuyu. The sultan, with the help of the treasury, repaired the burned down areas.

==Architecture==

Mahmud I started construction of the Cağaloğlu Bath, called Yeni Hamam, in the spring of 1740 on the site of Cağaloğlu Palace, which covers a large area. Foundation houses were built on the remaining empty lands and a neighborhood was established. The sultan opened the one in the courtyard of the Hagia Sophia Mosque, the first of the three libraries it established in Istanbul, with a ceremony and made 4,000 volumes. In the library, Sahih-i Buharf reading of ten inhabitants every day was one of the conditions of the foundation. Mahmud also came to the Rosary Gate of Hagia Sophia several times, sat in the library and listened to the commentary of tafsir. The famine, which appeared due to the heavy winter, became increasingly heavier at the end of spring.

==Relations with the Mughal Empire==
Nader Shah&#x27;s devastating campaign against the Mughal Empire, created a void in the western frontiers of Persia, which was effectively exploited by the Ottoman Sultan Mahmud I, who initiated the Ottoman–Persian War (1743–46), in which the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah closely cooperated with the Ottomans and their ambassador Haji Yusuf Agha, these relations between the two empires continued until Muhammad Shah&#x27;s death in 1748.

==Relations with Afsharid Empire==
In March 1741, the ambassador of Nadir Shah from Iran’s government, Hacı Han, came to Istanbul with 3,000 people and his guards unit to prolong the peace between them. Among his gifts were fabrics embroidered with jewels, ten elephants, and valuable weapons. Hacı Han was given a banquet in Fener Bahçesin. It was also a problem to pass the elephants brought by hand to Istanbul, and wide shakes were laid on the barges, so wooden curtains were laid around them so that elephants could not be scared.

The relations between the Afsharid Empire and Ottoman Empire became increasingly tense, reached a new dimension in February 1743, and Shah Safi, who was one of Shah Hussein&#x27;s princes and held hostage on Chios Island, was condemned and led to Nader Shah&#x27;s inability to complete. He was sent to the Afsharid border with the troops that joined him.

==Death==
Mahmud I was disturbed by fistula and during the harsh winter his health declined day by day. On Friday, 13 December 1754 he went for attending the Friday prayer. After attending the prayer he went back to his palace but in the journey he collapsed on his horse and died on the same day and was buried in his great-grandmother Turhan Sultan Mausoleum in New Mosque, at Eminönü, in Istanbul, Turkey.

== Family ==
There are eleven known consorts of Mahmud I, but he had no children by any of them (just as his heir, his younger half-brother Osman III, who also remained childless), despite a reign of twenty-four years. This is why Sakaoğlu, a Turkish historian, speculates that Mahmud may have been castrated during his years of imprisonment in Kafes.

The known consorts of Mahmud I are:
*Hace Ayşe Kadın. BaşKadin (first consort) until her death. She built a school in Çörekçikapısı, near the Fatih Mosque. The name &quot;Hace&quot; indicated that she had made the pilgrimage to Mecca by proxy. She died in 1746.
*Hatem Kadın. BaşKadin from the death of Ayşe Kadın in 1746 until the death of Mahmud I in 1754. She died in 1769 and was buried in the Ayazma mosque in Üsküdar.
*Hace Alicenab Kadın. She built schools and fountains in the Fatih neighborhood. The name &quot;Hace&quot; indicated that she had made the pilgrimage to Mecca by proxy. She died in 1775 and was buried in Yeni Cami.&quot;&quot;
*Hace Verdinaz Kadın. She built a school and a fountain in Murâdpaşa and another fountain in Galata. The name &quot;Hace&quot; indicated that she had made the pilgrimage to Mecca by proxy. She died on 16 December 1804, and was buried in Şehzâdebaşı. Her late death date suggests that she was one of the youngest consorts.
*Hatice Rami Kadın. She built a school and a fountain in Beşiktaş. A year after Mahmud I&#x27;s death in 1755, she married Inspector Haremeyn Mustafapaşazade İbrahim Bey. She died on 16 January 1780.
*Tiryal Kadın, who died between 1785 and 1789. 
*Raziye Kadın
*Meyyase Hanim 
*Fehmi Hanim
*Sirri Hanim 
*Habbabe Hanim

<doc id="208625" wikidata="Q199825" url="?curid=208625" title="Osman III">
<text>Osman III ( &quot;Osmān-i sālis&quot;;‎ 2 January 1699 – 30 October 1757) was the sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1754 to 1757. He was succeeded by his cousin Mustafa III.

==Early life==
Osman III was born on 2 January 1699 in the Edirne Palace. His father was Mustafa II and his mother was Şehsuvar Sultan. He was the younger half-brother of Mahmud I. When his father was deposed from the throne in 1703, he was taken back to Istanbul and imprisoned in the Kafes. Osman III lived in the Kafes for 51 years.

He was secretly circumcised on 17 April 1705 with the other princes here. He was among the princes in Ahmed&#x27;s entourage. He also later made trips to the sultan inside and outside the city. Together with his elder brother Mahmud&#x27;s embassy on 1 October 1730, he became the biggest prince waiting for the throne.

==Reign==
Osman III lived most of his life as a prisoner in the palace, and as a consequence, he had some behavioural peculiarities when he took the throne. Unlike previous sultans, he hated music, and banished all musicians from the palace. According to Baron de Tott, Osman III was an angry and a modest type of ruler.

Osman III&#x27;s initial action in governance was to select officials to collaborate with. Throughout his reign, the alterations he implemented in high-level governmental positions, particularly that of the Grand Vizier, can be seen as efforts to diminish the overwhelming influence of the charitable authority prevalent during the previous sultan&#x27;s era.

In the severe storm of March 1756, an Egyptian galleon ran ashore in Kumkapı at dusk. Due to the storm, 600 passengers could not be evacuated. The sultan, who came to the shore, took all the passengers by bringing barges from the shipyard. He ordered the construction of the Ahırkapı Lighthouse in Istanbul to prevent such incidents.

The first procession of his enthronement was held on 14 December 1754. Contemporary historians stopped writing on political events due to the severe and freezing cold of January 1755. Osman was responsible for a firman in 1757 that preserved the Status Quo of various sites for Christians, Muslims, and Jews in the Holy Land.

In the second year of his reign, Osman lost his mother Şehsuvar Sultan, afterward, the oldest prince Mehmed, died of illness on 22 December 1756. According to various sources, the funeral of the prince, controlled by the grand vizier and the sheikh al-Islam. It was attended by 5,000 people and contemporary sources mentioned that the prince was poisoned and killed on the initiative of Köse Mustafa Pasha.

The sultan was notified of provisions sent to oppose banditry in Anatolia and Rumelia. Measures were taken against the tribes of Bozulus and Cihanbeyli, the Armenians (due to the turmoil in Iran), the bandits around Erzurum and Sivas, and the famous leader Karaosmanoğlu Hacı Mustafa Ağa. The latter was captured and executed, and his head was brought to Istanbul on 5 December 1755.

===Architecture===
Osman is famous for building the Nuruosmaniye Mosque, whose construction started during the reign of Mahmud I. Nuruosmaniye Complex, also known as Osmaniye for a while, consisted of three schools, madrasahs, a factory, a library, a mausoleum, a temporary room, a mesh house, a fountain, an inn, and shops. Osman built a new neighborhood in 1755-56 where Üsküdar Palace and Garden was located, along with houses and shops. He also built the Ihsaniye Mosque and its masajid ( plural of masjid ), both of which stand today as İhsaniye.

Osman III built a fountain in his name in 1755–56; it was destroyed 122 years after its construction. 

==Death==
Osman III died on the night of 30 October 1757. In the early morning, a ceremony was held and his cousin Mustafa III was placed on the throne. The new sultan ordered Osman to be buried in the New Mosque Mausoleum, not in Nuruosmaniye.

== Family == 
Osman III had four known consorts but no children, as did his elder half-brother Mahmud I. Sakaoğlu, a Turkish historian, speculates that the two may have suffered castration while imprisoned in the Kafes, but other historians point out that Osman III was 55 at the time of his rise and, unlike his brother, who had a long reign, he was on the throne for only three years before he died, and that both of these factors may have influenced the fact of not having children. 

The known consorts of Osman III are: 
* Leyla Kadın. BaşKadin (First Consort) of Osman throughout his reign. In 1757, a few months after Osman&#x27;s death, she was married to Hacı Mehmed Emin Bey (d. 16 July 1785) with whom she had a son, Feyzullah Bey (d. 12 August 1792). She died in 1794 and was buried in Üsküdar.
* &quot;Fülane&quot; Kadın. Second Kadın. No information about her is known except her rank.
* Zevki Kadın. Third Kadın. She sponsored several building renovations and built a fountain in Fındıklı, in the Turkish-Baroque style.
* Emine Ferhunde Kadın. Fourth Kadin. She died in August 1791.

<text>Mustafa III (; &quot;Muṣṭafā-yi sālis&quot;; 28 January 1717 – 21 January 1774) was the sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1757 to 1774. He was a son of Sultan Ahmed III (1703–30), and his consort Mihrişah Kadın. He was succeeded by his brother Abdul Hamid I (1774–89).

==Early life==
Mustafa was born at the Edirne Palace on 28 January 1717. His father was Sultan Ahmed III, and his mother was Mihrişah Kadın. He had a full brother named Şehzade Süleyman. In 1720, a large fifteen day circumcision ceremony took place for Mustafa, and his brothers, princes Süleyman, Mehmed, and Bayezid. In 1730, after the Patrona Halil revolt led to the deposition of his father Sultan Ahmed III and the succession of his cousin Sultan Mahmud I, Mustafa, his father, and brothers were imprisoned in the Topkapı Palace. In 1756, after the death of his elder half-brother Mehmed, he became heir to the throne.

==Reign==
===Accession===
Mustafa ascended the throne on 30 October 1757, after the death of his cousin Osman III, the son of Sultan Mustafa II.

===Character of Mustafa&#x27;s rule===
Soon after his accession to the throne, Mustafa demonstrated a special care for justice. He took a number of measures to increase prosperity in Istanbul. He regulated coinage, built large grain stores, maintained aqueducts, and established a strict fiscal policy. He traveled frequently and checked whether the laws he had enforced were followed.

===Treaty with Prussia===
Mustafa much admired Frederick the Great&#x27;s generalship, and in 1761 established a peace treaty with Prussia. Frederick wanted an alliance against the Habsburgs, and Mustafa wanted to modernize his state and army. Mustafa preferred recruiting his officers in Berlin, rather than in Paris and London, to re-organize his army. In 1763, the two countries exchanged their diplomats for the first time.

===Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)===

Koca Ragıp Pasha, who remained grand vizier until 1763, pursued a peace policy towards neighboring countries. But the increasing influence of Russia over the Caucasus and its intention to control Poland created tension between the Ottomans and Russia. Ragıp Pasha&#x27;s successor Muhsinzade Mehmed Pasha also preferred to remain at peace, and Mustafa&#x27;s insistence on war (&quot;I will find some means of humbling those infidels&quot;) with Russia led to his resignation in 1768. The Sultan expected to gain an easy victory over the Russians, but in fact the Ottomans were unprepared for a long war. During the war, military reforms were undertaken, with the assistance of French officer François Baron de Tott. They included the modernization of artillery corps and the foundation of the Naval Engineering School in 1773. The war was disastrous for the Ottoman Empire. The Russian armies occupied Crimea, Romania and parts of Bulgaria.

===Architecture===
Many monumental buildings including the Fatih Mosque, which was built by Mehmed the Conqueror, were rebuilt from the ground during his reign. In addition, he had built Laleli Mosque complex, and the shore along the Yenikapı filled to set up a new neighborhood. Apart from these, he undertook other construction projects after the earthquakes of 1766,
and 1767.

==Personal life==
===Poetry===

He was a poet, his poetry being written under the pseudonym of &quot;Cihangir&quot;.

(Ottoman Turkish)

&quot;Yıkılupdur bu cihan sanma ki bizde düzele
Devleti çarh-ı deni verdi kamu müptezele
Şimdi erbab-ı saadette gezen hep hazele
İşimiz kaldı hemen merhamet-i lem yezele.&quot;

(Translation)

&quot;This world has ruined, don&#x27;t even think with us it recovers,
It was the lousy fate that has delivered the power to vulgars,
Now the perfidious ones have populated the Imperial Palace,
It&#x27;s now the mercy of the everlasting God that runs our business.

==Family==

=== Consorts ===
Mustafa III had seven known consorts:
* Aynülhayat Kadın ( - 1 August 1764). ProbablyBaşKadin (first consort), is sometimes considered Mustafa&#x27;s legal wife. She was the mother of at least one daughter and had a sister, Emine Hanim, in the harem like her. She built the Katırcıham Mescid Mosque on 1760. She was buried in Laleli.

<text>Subhumans are an English/UK punk rock band formed in the Warminster and Melksham areas of Wiltshire in 1980. Singer Dick Lucas had formerly been in another local band, the Mental, and other members had been in The Stupid Humans. The band&#x27;s musical style is typically classified as hardcore punk or anarcho-punk.

==History==
The band was formed in 1980, guitarist Bruce and drummer Andy were accompanied by original bassist Grant, previously from the band Audio Torture. The band was initially known as Superhumans due to insistence from Bruce&#x27;s mother but changed their name to Subhumans when Dick joined the band later the same year. By the end of 1980, drummer Andy had left and was replaced by Trotsky.

The band released a demo in 1981. It was heard by members of the band Flux of Pink Indians, after being sent to them by Graham Burnett of the &quot;New Crimes&quot; fanzine, and the band were so impressed that they offered Subhumans a record release on their newly founded label Spiderleg Records. The group&#x27;s debut EP, &quot;Demolition War&quot;, subsequently appeared on Spiderleg Records in December 1981.

Subhumans released two more EPs in 1982, &quot;Reasons for Existence&quot; and &quot;Religious Wars&quot;, as well as founding their record label, Bluurg Records. Although initially focused on releasing cassette recordings, the label produced its first vinyl release with the &quot;Wessex &#x27;82&quot; EP, which featured one track each by the Subhumans (&quot;No Thanks&quot;), The Pagans, Organised Chaos, and The A-Heads.

The band&#x27;s first LP, &quot;The Day The Country Died&quot; was released in 1983 on Spiderleg Records. Generally considered a classic of the anarcho-punk era, it was followed shortly after by the &quot;Evolution&quot; EP, which was also the band&#x27;s first record (bar the &quot;Wessex &#x27;82&quot; split) to be released on their own label. The band released &quot;Time Flies... But Aeroplanes Crash&quot; later that same year, a 12&quot; EP consisting of both studio and live tracks - the live tracks taken from an aborted live album. Towards the end of the year, original bassist Grant left the band (shortly before the recording sessions for their second album) and was replaced by Phil of the Pagans. (Bruce Treasure, Andy Gale, Grant Jackson, Trotsky and Phil Bryant all attended Kingdown Comprehensive School in Warminster, England).

The following year, the band released their second album, &quot;From the Cradle to the Grave&quot;. The release demonstrated a notable musical development for the band, particularly with the title track - a progressive piece that took up the album&#x27;s entire second side and ran for almost 17 minutes. It was followed by one last EP, &quot;Rats&quot;, in January 1985, and the &quot;EP-LP&quot; release - a compilation album comprising the band&#x27;s first four EPs.

Subhumans broke up at the end of 1985, after recording their third album &quot;Worlds Apart&quot;, with musical differences being cited as the main reason for the split. A final 12&quot; record (1986&#x27;s &quot;29:29 Split Vision&quot;) was also recorded and released posthumously and demonstrated just how far the band&#x27;s musical leanings had altered from their initial hardcore punk stylings. Lucas subsequently joined Culture Shock in 1986 and then formed the political ska punk band Citizen Fish in 1990. A second Subhumans compilation album was released the same year (&quot;Time Flies + Rats&quot;), which comprised the two later EPs absent from the &quot;EP-LP&quot; release.

Subhumans had a brief reunion for a couple of shows in about 1991, and a more comprehensive return in 1998, which included UK and US concerts. This resulted in a semi-permanent return of the band as a touring entity, including at least two major tours of North America in the twenty-first century – the &quot;Live in a Dive&quot; recording released on Fat Wreck Chords being a product of the second tour recorded at the Showcase Theatre in Corona, CA. The band also recorded and released a new EP, &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;, in 1998, which consists of previously unreleased songs from the band&#x27;s original incarnation.

Since then, Subhumans have recorded a new album, &quot;Internal Riot&quot;, and self-released it on Bluurg Records in September 2007. They toured in Europe throughout 2007, and a month-long U.S. tour began on 24 August that year. They have maintained a live presence ever since.

For nearly a decade, Subhumans continued to make multiple live performances across the UK and the US, and on 13 September 2019, Subhumans released a new album titled &quot;Crisis Point&quot;, which was the band&#x27;s first album in 12 years. The album covered several modern-day issues while moving back into the anarcho-punk genre, with its messages and general punk tune in the song.

==Legacy==
In an interview with The Guardian in 2016, the band was citied along with a number of other British Anarcho-punk bands of the early 80s as being an influence to the American avant-garde metal group Neurosis.

Subhumans have been covered by acts such as Queens of the Stone Age, and MDC. Travis Barker of blink-182 has worn a Subhumans t-shirt in public on multiple occasions. Fat Mike of NOFX has also spoken about his love for Subhumans.
