<text>The Penghu ( , Hokkien POJ: &quot;Phîⁿ-ô͘&quot;  or &quot;Phêⁿ-ô͘&quot; ) or Pescadores Islands are an archipelago of 90 islands and islets in the Taiwan Strait, about west of the main island of Taiwan across the Penghu Channel, covering an area of . The archipelago collectively forms of Taiwan and is the smallest county of Taiwan. The largest city is Magong, on the largest island, which is also named Magong.

The Penghu islands first appear in the historical record in the Tang dynasty and were inhabited by Chinese people under the Southern Song dynasty, during which they were attached to Jinjiang County of Fujian. The archipelago was formally incorporated as an administrative unit of China in 1281 under Tong&#x27;an County of Jiangzhe Province in the Yuan dynasty. It continued to be controlled by Imperial China with brief European occupations by the Dutch Empire (1622–1624) and Second French colonial empire (1885), until it was ceded to the Japanese Empire in 1895. Since the end of World War II, Penghu has been governed by the Republic of China (ROC). Under the terms of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty and the subsequent Taiwan Relations Act between the ROC and the United States, Penghu is defined and geographically acknowledged as part of Taiwan.

Penghu Islands rely solely on sea and air transportation, with air transport having a significant role in outside access. The islands are served by three local domestic airports: Penghu Airport, Qimei Airport, and Wang-an Airport. The Penghu National Scenic Area comprises most of the islands and islets of the archipelago. It is also renowned for its unique natural feature of columnar basalt landscape. Tourism is one of the main sources of income to the county.

==Name==

The &quot;Penghu&quot; islands were mentioned in a series of poems from the Tang dynasty (618–907). In the Song dynasty (960–1279), it was mentioned that in the Tang period, &quot;Pinghu&quot; barbarians from beyond Quanzhou had laid siege to Fuzhou, now the capital of Fujian Province. In 1171, described a place across the sea from Quanzhou, identified as Penghu, that had thousands of sandbars called &quot;Pinghu&quot; (flat lake) because of the &quot;encircling shape of its inner coastline&quot;. Song sources describe migrants from Fujian cultivating land on Pinghu. In 1225, the Song historian Zhao Rukuo called the islands attached to Jinjiang County &quot;Penghu&quot;. In 1227, Wang Xiangzhi described Penghu as a group of 36 islands in an &quot;outlying region&quot; which took three days to reach by sailing from Jinjiang. In the Southern Min language, both Pinghu and Penghu are pronounced similarly, and scholars in Taiwan believe them to be the same place. In Southern Min it is pronounced &quot;Phêⁿ-ô·&quot;.

According to the official &quot;Penghu County Chronicle&quot;, Penghu&#x27;s original name had been &quot;Pinghu&quot;(平湖), but as &quot;Ping&quot;(平) sounded similar to &quot;Peng&quot;(彭) in Hokkien, &quot;Pinghu&quot;(平湖) was also written as &quot;Penghu&quot;(彭湖), and ultimately the consensus, is to write &quot;Penghu&quot;(澎湖). The islands have also been called &quot;Pehoe&quot; from the Minnan name &quot;Phêⁿ-ô·&quot;.

The name &quot;Pescadores&quot; comes from the Portuguese name &quot;Ilhas dos Pescadores&quot; (&quot;Fishermen Islands&quot;). The European Portuguese pronunciation is but, in English, it is typically closer to .

==History==
===Prehistory===
Penghu 1, a fossil jaw (mandible) dating to the Middle or Late Pleistocene that belonged to a member of an extinct hominin species, possibly a Denisovan, was discovered in the Penghu Channel .

Finds of fine red cord-marked pottery at Guoye, Huxi, indicate that Penghu was visited by Austronesians from southwestern Taiwan around 5,000 years ago, though not settled permanently.

===Song dynasty===

Han Chinese from southern Fujian began to establish fishing communities on the islands in the 9th and 10th centuries, and representatives were intermittently stationed there by the Southern Song and Yuan governments from . Chinese fishermen had settled on the Penghu Islands by 1171, when a group of &quot;Bisheye&quot; bandits with dark skin speaking a foreign language landed on Penghu and plundered the fields planted by Chinese migrants. The Song government sent soldiers after them and from that time on, Song patrols regularly visited Penghu in the spring and summer. A local official, had houses built on Penghu and stationed troops there to prevent depredations by the Bisheye. Coins dating to the Xining (1068–1077) and Zhenghe (1111–1117) reign periods as well as many Song pottery and porcelain shards have been unearthed in Penghu.

In 1225, the &quot;Book of Barbarian Nations&quot; anecdotally indicated that Penghu was attached to Jinjiang, Quanzhou Prefecture.
A group of Quanzhou immigrants lived on Penghu.

===Yuan dynasty===
In November 1281, the Yuan dynasty under Emperor Shizu officially established the &quot;Penghu Patrol and Inspection Agency&quot; under the jurisdiction of Tong&#x27;an County, incorporating Penghu into China&#x27;s borders 403 years earlier than Taiwan.

Wang Dayuan gave a detailed first-hand account of the islands in his &quot;Daoyi Zhilüe&quot; (1349).

===Ming dynasty===

In the 15th century, the Ming ordered the evacuation of the islands as part of their maritime ban. When these restrictions were removed in the late 16th century, legal fishing communities, most of which hailed from Tong&#x27;an County, were re-established on the islands. These fishermen worshiped at the Mazu Temple that gave Magong its name and themselves gave rise to the Portuguese and English name &quot;Pescadores&quot;. The Ming established a permanent military presence starting in 1597.

At this time, the Dutch East India Company was trying to force China to open a port in Fujian to Dutch trade and expel the Portuguese from Macau. When the Dutch were defeated by the Portuguese at the Battle of Macau in 1622, they seized Penghu, built a fort there, and threatened raids on Chinese ports and shipping unless the Chinese allowed trading with them on Penghu and that China not trade with Manila. In response, the Chinese governor of Fujian demanded that the Dutch withdraw from Penghu to Taiwan, where the Chinese would permit them to engage in trade. The Dutch continued to raid the Fujian coast between October 1622 and January 1624 to force their demands, but were unsuccessful. In 1624, the new governor of Fujian sent a fleet of 40–50 warships with 5,000 troops to Penghu and expelled the Dutch, who moved to Fort Zeelandia on Taiwan.

===Qing dynasty===

For a period in the mid-17th century, Taiwan and the archipelago were ruled by the Kingdom of Tungning under the Zheng family, which was overthrown by the Qing dynasty in 1683 after the Battle of Penghu. Military personnel were stationed on Penghu afterwards. Penghu became a sub-prefecture of Taiwan Prefecture, Fujian Province, in the Qing period.

The Penghu archipelago was captured by the French in March 1885, in the closing weeks of the Sino-French War, and evacuated four months later. The Pescadores Campaign was the last campaign of Admiral Amédée Courbet, whose naval victories in the war had made him a national hero in France. Courbet was among several French soldiers and sailors who died of cholera during the French occupation of Penghu. He died aboard his flagship in Makung harbour on 11 June 1885.

===Empire of Japan===

Towards the end of the First Sino-Japanese War, having defeated the Qing in northern China, Japan sought to ensure that it obtained Penghu and Taiwan in the final settlement. In March 1895, the Japanese defeated the Chinese garrison on the islands and occupied Makung. The Japanese occupation of Penghu, with its fine harbor, gave the Imperial Japanese Navy an advanced base from which their short-range coal-burning ships could control the Taiwan Straits and thus prevent more Chinese troops from being sent to Taiwan. This action persuaded the Chinese negotiators at Shimonoseki that Japan was determined to annex Taiwan, and, after Penghu, Taiwan and the Liaodong Peninsula had been ceded to Japan in the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Shimonoseki in April, helped to ensure the success of the Japanese invasion of Taiwan in May.

Penghu County was then called the Hōko Prefecture by the Japanese government of Taiwan. In World War II, Makō (Makung) was a major base for the Imperial Japanese Navy and the embarkation point for the invasion of the Philippines.

In 1944, Penghu was extensively bombed in the Penghu air raids.

===Republic of China===
In the Cairo Declaration of 1943, the United States, the United Kingdom and China stated it to be their purpose that &quot;all the territories that Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Formosa and The Pescadores, shall be restored to the Republic of China&quot;. On 26 July 1945, the three governments issued the Potsdam Declaration, declaring that &quot;the terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out&quot;. However, the United States and the United Kingdom have regarded the aforementioned documents as merely wartime statements of intention with no binding force in law.

Following the surrender of Japan on 2 September 1945, Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers Douglas MacArthur issued General Order No. 1, which directed Japanese forces to surrender to the Allied Powers and facilitate the occupation of Japanese territories by the Allied Powers. The Office of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers ordered Japanese forces in China and Taiwan to surrender to Chiang Kai-shek, who the Allied Powers delegated to accept the surrender. On 25 October 1945, Governor-General Rikichi Andō handed over the administration of Taiwan and the Penghu islands to the head of the Taiwan Investigation Commission, Chen Yi.

The Republic of China and Japan signed the Treaty of Taipei on April 28, 1952, and the treaty came into force on August 5, which is considered by some as giving a legal support to the Republic of China&#x27;s claim to Taiwan as &quot;de jure&quot; territory. The treaty stipulates that all treaties, conventions, and agreements between China and Japan prior to 9 December 1941 were null and void, which according to Hungdah Chiu, abolishes the Treaty of Shimonoseki ceding Taiwan to Japan. In the 1956 &quot;Japan v. Lai Chin Jung&quot; case, it was stated that Taiwan and the Penghu islands came to belong to the ROC on the date the Treaty of Taipei came into force.

However, in 1954, the United States denied that the sovereignty over Taiwan and the Penghu islands had been settled by the Treaty of Taipei. In the following year, the United States also stated its position that Taiwan and Penghu were handed over to the Allied Powers, and that the Republic of China was merely asked to administer these territories for the Allied Powers pending a final decision as to their ownership.
 In the 1960 &quot;Sheng v. Rogers&quot; case, it was stated that, in the view of the U.S. State Department, no agreement has purported to transfer the sovereignty of Taiwan to the ROC, though it accepted the exercise of Chinese authority over Taiwan and recognized the Government of the Republic of China as the legal government of China at the time.

Boat people fleeing Vietnam in the 1970s and 1980s who were rescued by Taiwan&#x27;s ships in the South China Sea were sent to Penghu.

On 25 May 2002, China Airlines Flight 611, a Boeing 747-200 aircraft flying from Taipei to Hong Kong, disintegrated and exploded over the Islands. The wreckage slammed into the Taiwan Strait, a couple of miles off the coast. All 225 passengers and crew on board were killed.

==Climate==
Penghu County has a dry-winter humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: Cwa), bordering on a regular humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfa).
==Geology==

Penghu is the remnant of a Miocene-age shield volcano. The stratigraphy of the island is dominated by two to four layers of basalt interbedded with sandstone and mudstone deposited in shallow marine conditions.
==Demographics==
===Ethnicities===
The majority of the populace (72%+) in Penghu are descendants of settlers from Tong&#x27;an in Fujian.

===Population===

===Language===
In Penghu, the native language is Taiwanese Hokkien, with Tong&#x27;an dialect being the most prevalent speech.

==Government==


Penghu County is administered by Penghu County Government headed by Magistrate Lai Feng-wei of the Kuomintang and headquartered at the Penghu County Hall.

===Administrative divisions===

Penghu County is divided into one city and five rural townships. It is further divided into 97 villages. Like Lienchiang County, Penghu County has no urban townships. The county seat is at Magong City, where it houses the Penghu County Hall and Penghu County Council.
The main island (comprising Magong City and Huxi Township), Baisha Island and Xiyu are the three most populous islands and are connected via bridges. The Penghu Great Bridge connecting Baisha and Xiyu is the longest bridge in Taiwan. Two shorter bridges connect Huxi and Baisha via the small island of Zhongtun.

===Politics===
The county elects a single representative to the Legislative Yuan. In the 2016 Republic of China legislative election, this seat was won by the Democratic Progressive Party with 55.4% of the vote.

==Political dispute==
Despite the controversy over the political status of Taiwan, both the Republic of China and the People&#x27;s Republic of China agree that Penghu is a county in (their own respective) &quot;Taiwan Province&quot; (Taiwan Province, Republic of China and Taiwan Province, People&#x27;s Republic of China). Yet, geographically, the island of Taiwan does not include Penghu, although it is closer to Taiwan than mainland China. Thus, Penghu is listed separately from &quot;Taiwan&quot; in some contexts, e.g. the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu (the official WTO name for the Republic of China) and in the Treaty of Shimonoseki, the Cairo Declaration, and the Treaty of San Francisco.

==Economy==
Due to its restricted geography, fishing has been the main industry for Penghu. The Agriculture and Fisheries Bureau of the Penghu County Government governs matters related to agriculture and fisheries in Penghu. 

In 2016, the bureau placed a ban on the harvesting of sea urchins due to their declining population. The ban was partially lifted in 2017, with catches limited to only specimens larger than in diameter.

==Education==
Education-related matters in Penghu County are administered under the Education Department of the Penghu County Government. The county houses the National Penghu University of Science and Technology.
==Energy==

Penghu is powered by the Chienshan Power Plant, a 140 MW diesel-fired power plant commissioned in 2001, and the Hujing Power Plant on Table Island. On 24 December 2010, the Taiwan-Penghu Undersea Cable Project of Taipower was approved by the Executive Yuan to connect the electrical grid in Taiwan Island to Penghu.

Under a wind power development project approved in 2002 by the Executive Yuan, the ROC government plans to set up a total of 200 wind turbines in Penghu within 10 years. However, only 14 turbines have been set up . On 1 October 2015, Taipower announced the construction of another 11 new wind turbines across the island, of which six will be constructed in Huxi Township and five in Baisha Township.

The current total desalination capacity of the county to provide clean water to its residents is 15,500 m3 per day. To reduce its groundwater use, in November 2015 the county secured a contract of building an additional desalination plant with 4,000 m3 capacity per day, construction of which is expected to be completed by May 2018.

==Tourism==
The Penghu National Scenic Area was established in the early 1990s, comprising most of the islands and islets of the archipelago. Tourism has since become one of the main sources of income of the county.

Historical sites include Central Street, Erdai Art Hall, Tianhou Temple, Four-eyed Well, Penghu Reclamation Hall, Qimei Lighthouse, Xiyu Eastern Fort, Jinguitou Fortress and Xiyu Western Fort. Museums in the county are Chuwan Crab Museum, Ocean Resources Museum, Chang Yu-sheng Memorial Museum and Penghu Living Museum. Other attractions in the county include the Double-Heart of Stacked Stones, Fenggui Cave, Little Taiwan, Whale Cave, Xiaomen Geology Gallery and South Penghu Marine National Park.

Since 1 January 2015, tourists from Mainland China can directly apply for the Exit &amp; Entry Permit upon arrival in Penghu. This privilege also applies to Kinmen and the Matsu Islands as a means to boost tourism in the outlying islands of Taiwan.

The county welcomed 1.8 million tourists in 2018 with an average annual growth of around 10%.

==Drug trafficking==
As a lightly populated outlying island, Penghu lends itself to being used as a trans-shipment hub for drug smuggling into Taiwan from China and the Philippines. Beginning in 2016, the area became the focus of a major drug trafficking crackdown by the Taiwanese police.

In 2016, Chou Meng-hsiang (周盟翔), chief prosecutor of the Penghu District Prosecutors Office, &quot;led an investigation team in Taiwan, including officers from the Coast Guard Administration, in a bid to bring (a) drug trafficking ring to justice.&quot; A joint investigation with Philippine and Chinese authorities spanning one and a half years resulted in the seizure of &quot;22.6 kilograms of amphetamine, 11.4 kilograms of ephedrine, and about 40 kilograms of calcium chloride&quot; with an estimated value of NT$123 million. Eight suspects were arrested in Cagayan, a small island in northern Philippines, but no Taiwanese nationals were charged in relation to the importation scheme.

In 2017, media reported &quot;the biggest-ever haul of drugs in the county&#x27;s history&quot; when 506 kg of ephedrine was seized from a Chinese fishing boat off Penghu &quot;as part of an ongoing crackdown on the area drug trade&quot;. Ephedrine smuggling has increased in recent years as it has a similar structure to amphetamines and can be easily converted into methamphetamine. According to a Focus Taiwan report, &quot;(It) can then be sold for ten times the price, in this case that would be more than NT$1 billion (US$33.33 million).&quot;

Despite the size of the drug seizure, only the five crew members of the Chinese fishing boat were detained in the operation, with authorities &quot;unable to find the Taiwanese ship which should have turned up to take delivery of the drugs&quot;. It was unclear from media reports how the Taiwanese side of the smuggling operation knew to abort the rendezvous. The suppliers of the shipment also evaded capture. It was believed that the drugs were destined to be transported from Penghu for distribution on Taiwan.

==Transport==
===Air===
Penghu is served by Penghu Airport in Magong City and Qimei Airport in Cimei Township. Both airports opened in 1977. Daily Air operates flights between Penghu to Kaohsiung.

===Water===
The county has Magong Harbor and Longmen Jianshan Pier. Magong Harbor hosts ferry connections with Kaohsiung, Tainan, Chiayi and Kinmen.

<text>A pyroclastic flow (also known as a pyroclastic density current or a pyroclastic cloud) is a fast-moving current of hot gas and volcanic matter (collectively known as tephra) that flows along the ground away from a volcano at average speeds of but is capable of reaching speeds up to . The gases and tephra can reach temperatures of about .

Pyroclastic flows are the deadliest of all volcanic hazards and are produced as a result of certain explosive eruptions; they normally touch the ground and hurtle downhill or spread laterally under gravity. Their speed depends upon the density of the current, the volcanic output rate, and the gradient of the slope.

==Origin of term==
The word &quot;pyroclast&quot; is derived from the Greek (&quot;pýr&quot;), meaning &quot;fire&quot;, and (&quot;klastós&quot;), meaning &quot;broken in pieces&quot;. A name for pyroclastic flows that glow red in the dark is (French, &quot;burning cloud&quot;); this was notably used to describe the disastrous 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée on Martinique, a French island in the Caribbean.

Pyroclastic flows that contain a much higher proportion of gas to rock are known as &quot;fully dilute pyroclastic density currents&quot; or pyroclastic surges. The lower density sometimes allows them to flow over higher topographic features or water such as ridges, hills, rivers, and seas. They may also contain steam, water, and rock at less than ; these are called &quot;cold&quot; compared with other flows, although the temperature is still lethally high. Cold pyroclastic surges can occur when the eruption is from a vent under a shallow lake or the sea. Fronts of some pyroclastic density currents are fully dilute; for example, during the eruption of Mount Pelée in 1902, a fully dilute current overwhelmed the city of Saint-Pierre and killed nearly 30,000 people.

A pyroclastic flow is a type of gravity current; in scientific literature, it is sometimes abbreviated to PDC (pyroclastic density current).

==Causes==

Several mechanisms can produce a pyroclastic flow:

* &quot;Fountain collapse&quot; of an eruption column from a Plinian eruption (e.g. Mount Vesuvius&#x27; destruction of Herculaneum and Pompeii in 79 AD). In such an eruption, the material forcefully ejected from the vent heats the surrounding air and the turbulent mixture rises, through convection, for many kilometers. If the erupted jet is unable to heat the surrounding air sufficiently, convection currents will not be strong enough to carry the plume upwards and it falls, flowing down the flanks of the volcano.
* &quot;Fountain collapse&quot; of an eruption column associated with a Vulcanian eruption (e.g., Montserrat&#x27;s Soufrière Hills volcano has generated many of these deadly pyroclastic flows and surges). The gas and projectiles create a cloud that is denser than the surrounding air and becomes a pyroclastic flow.
* Frothing at the mouth of the vent during degassing of the erupted lava. This can lead to the production of a rock called ignimbrite. This occurred during the eruption of Novarupta in 1912.
* Gravitational collapse of a lava dome or spine, with subsequent avalanches and flows down a steep slope (e.g., Montserrat&#x27;s Soufrière Hills volcano, which caused nineteen deaths in 1997).
* The directional blast (or jet) when part of a volcano collapses or explodes (e.g., the eruption of Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980). As distance from the volcano increases, this rapidly transforms into a gravity-driven current.

==Size and effects==

Flow volumes range from a few hundred cubic meters to more than . Larger flows can travel for hundreds of kilometres, although none on that scale has occurred for several hundred thousand years. Most pyroclastic flows are around and travel for several kilometres. Flows usually consist of two parts: the &quot;basal flow&quot; hugs the ground and contains larger, coarse boulders and rock fragments, while an extremely hot ash plume lofts above it because of the turbulence between the flow and the overlying air, admixing and heating cold atmospheric air causing expansion and convection. Flows can deposit less than 1 meter to 200 meters in depth of loose rock fragment.

The kinetic energy of the moving cloud will flatten trees and buildings in its path. The hot gases and high speed make them particularly lethal, as they will incinerate living organisms instantaneously or turn them into carbonized fossils: 
* The cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, Italy, for example, were engulfed by pyroclastic surges in AD 79 with many lives lost.
* The 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée destroyed the Martinique town of St. Pierre. Despite signs of impending eruption, the government deemed St. Pierre safe due to hills and valleys between it and the volcano, but the pyroclastic flow charred almost the entirety of the city, killing all but three of its 30,000 residents.
* A pyroclastic surge killed volcanologists Harry Glicken and Katia and Maurice Krafft and 40 other people on Mount Unzen, in Japan, on June 3, 1991. The surge started as a pyroclastic flow and the more energised surge climbed a spur on which the Kraffts and the others were standing; it engulfed them, and the corpses were covered with about of ash.
* On June 25, 1997, a pyroclastic flow travelled down Mosquito Ghaut on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. A large, highly energized pyroclastic surge developed. This flow could not be restrained by the Ghaut and spilled out of it, killing 19 people who were in the Streatham village area (which was officially evacuated). Several others in the area suffered severe burns.

===Interaction with water===
Testimonial evidence from the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, supported by experimental evidence, shows that pyroclastic flows can cross significant bodies of water. However, that might be a pyroclastic surge, not flow, because the density of a gravity current means it cannot move across the surface of water. One flow reached the Sumatran coast as far as away.

A 2006 BBC documentary film, &quot;Ten Things You Didn&#x27;t Know About Volcanoes&quot;, demonstrated tests by a research team at Kiel University, Germany, of pyroclastic flows moving over the water. When the reconstructed pyroclastic flow (stream of mostly hot ash with varying densities) hit the water, two things happened: the heavier material fell into the water, precipitating out from the pyroclastic flow and into the liquid; the temperature of the ash caused the water to evaporate, propelling the pyroclastic flow (now only consisting of the lighter material) along on a bed of steam at an even faster pace than before.

During some phases of the Soufriere Hills volcano on Montserrat, pyroclastic flows were filmed about offshore. These show the water boiling as the flow passes over it. The flows eventually built a delta, which covered about . Another example was observed in 2019 at Stromboli when a pyroclastic flow traveled for several hundreds of meters above the sea.

A pyroclastic flow can interact with a body of water to form a large amount of mud, which can then continue to flow downhill as a lahar. This is one of several mechanisms that can create a lahar.

===On other celestial bodies===
In 1963, NASA astronomer Winifred Cameron proposed that the lunar equivalent of terrestrial pyroclastic flows may have formed sinuous rilles on the Moon. In a lunar volcanic eruption, a pyroclastic cloud would follow local relief, resulting in an often sinuous track. The Moon&#x27;s Schröter&#x27;s Valley offers one example.
Some volcanoes on Mars, such as Tyrrhenus Mons and Hadriacus Mons, have produced layered deposits that appear to be more easily eroded than lava flows, suggesting that they were emplaced by pyroclastic flows.

<text>Peter Anthony Motteux (born Pierre Antoine Motteux ; 25 February 1663 – 18 February 1718) was a French-born English author, playwright, and translator. Motteux was a significant figure in the evolution of English journalism in his era, as the publisher and editor of &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, &quot;the first English magazine,&quot; from 1692 to 1694.

==Life==
A native of Rouen, he was a French Huguenot who came to England in 1685 after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. At first he lived with his godfather, Paul Dominique, and made his living as an auctioneer; by 1706 he maintained a shop in Leadenhall Street, selling imports from China, Japan, and India, and (in his own words) &quot;silks, lace, linens, pictures, and other goods.&quot; He also held a position with the Post Office in the first decade of the 18th century.

His death in a bawdy house was thought to be suspicious, and caused a good deal of legal disturbance. Five people were tried for his murder, but were acquitted. His death was ultimately ruled an accident by erotic asphyxiation. He was survived by his widow Priscilla, two sons and a daughter.

==Translations==
Motteux is perhaps best known for completing Sir Thomas Urquhart&#x27;s translation of Rabelais&#x27; &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;. Books I and II of Urquhart&#x27;s translation of Rabelais had been published in 1653; Motteux (with outside help) revised these, completed Urquart&#x27;s translation of Book III, and translated Book IV and the possibly-spurious Book V. The entire work was published in 1693 and 1694 (reprinted in 1708; revised by John Ozell in 1737).

While Urquhart&#x27;s original version of Rabelais has sometimes been acclaimed as a masterpiece in itself, critics have had reservations about Motteux&#x27;s continuation. In part, Motteux suffered for frankly rendering the vulgarity of Rabelais, to a generation of readers less prepared to tolerate it than Urquhart&#x27;s had been.

Motteux produced an important translation of the Miguel de Cervantes novel &quot;Don Quixote&quot;; this 4-volume 1700–03 edition (3rd edition in 1712) was credited as &quot;translated from the original by many hands and published by Peter Motteux.&quot; Very popular in its own era, Motteux&#x27;s version of the work has been condemned by later translators. John Ormsby listed numerous faults he found with Motteux&#x27;s translation, and described it as &quot;worse than worthless ... worthless as failing to represent, worse than worthless as misrepresenting&quot; the spirit and flavour of the original.

Motteux translated other works as well, one example being &quot;The Present State of the Empire of Morocco&quot; (1695) by French diplomat François Pidou de Saint-Olon.

==Dramas==
Motteux wrote a series of plays and musical librettos that were produced during the 1690s and early 18th century, including:

* &quot;The Loves of Mars and Venus&quot; (1695)
* &quot;Love&#x27;s a Jest&quot; (1696)
* &quot;She Ventures and He Wins&quot; (1696)
* &quot;The Novelty, or Every Act a Play&quot; (1697)
* &quot;Beauty in Distress&quot; (1698)
* &quot;Britain&#x27;s Happiness&quot; (1704)
* &quot;The Stage Coach&quot; (1704)
* &quot;The Amorous Miser, or the Younger the Wiser&quot; (1705)
* &quot;Thomyris, Queen of Scythia&quot; (1707)
* &quot;Love&#x27;s Triumph&quot; (1708)

—among others. As its subtitle indicates, &quot;The Novelty&quot; was an anthology of five short plays in different genres, comedy, tragedy, pastoral, masque, and farce.

Motteux worked in the English stage genre then called &quot;opera,&quot; which were semi-operas somewhat comparable to modern musicals; works like &quot;The Rape of Europa by Jupiter&quot; (1694), &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot; (1701), and &quot;Arsinoe, Queen of Cyprus&quot; (1705), &quot;Thomyris, Queen of Scythia&quot; (17078 the first two with music by John Eccles, the third with music by Thomas Clayton and the fourth arranged by Johann Christoph Pepusch. His final works are translations and adaptations of opera libretti from the Italian.

As was typical of Restoration drama, Motteux&#x27;s plays often adapted earlier works; and his plays in turn were adapted by others into new forms. His semi-opera &quot;The Island Princess, or the Generous Portuguese&quot; (1699) was an adaptation of John Fletcher&#x27;s play &quot;The Island Princess&quot;, with music by Daniel Purcell, Richard Leveridge and Jeremiah Clarke. The mezzo-soprano, Mrs Lindsey sang interludes at its first performance at Drury Lane in February 1699.

After his death, the comic subplot of &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot; was transformed into &quot;a comic mask&quot; called &quot;Roger and Joan, or the Country Wedding&quot; (1739). Much later, David Garrick adapted &quot;The Novelty&quot; into a farce titled &quot;The Lying Varlet&quot;, published in 1823.

==Journalism==
Motteux edited &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Journal, or the Monthly Miscellany&quot; from its initial issue, dated January 1692, to its last of November 1694; evidence suggests he wrote most of the prose in each issue as well. (The plan was for monthly issues, though some were late, and some were missed.) Motteux may have been influenced by &quot;Le Mercure Galant&quot;, a French periodical of the 1670s devoted to Court news and gossip—though Motteux&#x27;s &quot;Journal&quot; was more ambitious. The &quot;Journal&quot; published &quot;News, History, Philosophy, Poetry, Musick, Translations, &amp;c.&quot; It covered a wider range of topics than other periodicals of its era like John Dunton&#x27;s &quot;The Athenian Gazette&quot;, giving it some claim as the first &quot;general interest&quot; magazine in English. Motteux reviewed plays by John Dryden (a personal friend) and William Congreve among others; he published verse by the poets of the era, including Matthew Prior and Charles Sedley; he covered the musical career of Henry Purcell and printed several of his songs. The short fictions published in the journal contributed to the formation of the novel in English. The &quot;Journal&quot; even featured a &quot;Lovers&#x27; Gazette,&quot; foreshadowing the advice-to-the-lovelorn columns of later generations of popular journalism.

Though its existence was relatively brief in historical terms, the &quot;Journal&quot; provided a precedent for later publications of the same type, notably &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;The London Magazine&quot;. One curiosity of the &quot;Journal&quot; is that the title page of its first issue bore the motto &quot;E pluribus unum&quot;, apparently the earliest use of what would later become the motto of the United States of America. Motteux used the phrase in the sense of &quot;one chosen among many,&quot; rather than its common later connotation. (Classicists have attempted to trace possible sources for the motto, ranging from Vergil to Aristotle to Horace to Cicero to St. Augustine.)

Motteux published early arguments in favor of the equality of the sexes; he re-titled the October 1693 issue of the &quot;Journal&quot; &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Journal,&quot; and devoted it to articles by and about women.

<doc id="206525" wikidata="Q18481" url="?curid=206525" title="Caliban (moon)">
<text>Caliban is the second-largest retrograde irregular satellite of Uranus. It was discovered on 6 September 1997 by Brett J. Gladman, Philip D. Nicholson, Joseph A. Burns, and John J. Kavelaars using the 200-inch Hale Telescope together with Sycorax and given the temporary designation S/1997 U 1.

Designated Uranus XVI, it was named after the monster character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

== Orbit ==

Caliban follows a distant orbit, more than 10 times further from Uranus than Oberon, the outermost regular moon. Its orbit is retrograde, moderately inclined and slightly eccentric. The orbital parameters suggest that it may belong to the same dynamic cluster as Stephano and Francisco, suggesting common origin.

The diagram illustrates the orbital parameters of the retrograde irregular satellites of Uranus (in polar co-ordinates) with the eccentricity of the orbits represented by the segments extending from the pericentre to the apocentre.

== Physical characteristics ==
Caliban&#x27;s diameter is estimated to be around 42 km, based on thermal measurements by the Herschel Space Observatory. Its albedo is estimated at around 0.22, which is unusually high compared to those of other Uranian irregular satellites. Neptune&#x27;s largest irregular satellite, Nereid, has a similarly high albedo as Caliban.

Somewhat inconsistent reports put Caliban in &quot;light-red&quot; category ( , ), redder than Himalia but still less red than most Kuiper belt objects. Caliban may be slightly redder than Sycorax. It also absorbs light at 0.7 μm, and one group of astronomers think this may be a result of liquid water that modified the surface.

Measurements of Caliban&#x27;s light curve by the Kepler space telescope indicate that its rotation period is about 9.9 hours.

== Origin ==

Caliban is hypothesized to be a captured object: it did not form in the accretionary disk that existed around Uranus just after its formation. The exact capture mechanism is not known, but capturing a moon requires the dissipation of energy. The possible capture processes include: gas drag in the protoplanetary disk, many body interactions and the capture during the fast growth of the Uranus&#x27; mass (so-called &quot;pull-down&quot;).

<doc id="206530" wikidata="Q17146145" url="?curid=206530" title="Rule by decree">
<text>Rule by [[decree]] is a style of governance allowing quick, unchallenged promulgation of law by a single person or group of people, usually without legislative approval. While intended to allow rapid responses to a crisis, rule by decree is easily abused and is often a key feature of dictatorships.

When a state of emergency, such as martial law, is in place, rule by decree is common. While rule by decree is easily susceptible to the whims and corruption of the person in power, it is also highly efficient: a law can take weeks or months to pass in a legislature, but can be edited quickly during ruling by decree. This is what makes it valuable in emergency situations. Thus, it is allowed by many constitutions, including the French, Argentine, Indian and Hungarian constitutions.

The expression is also sometimes used when describing actions of democratic governments that are perceived to unduly bypass scrutiny from the legislature or populace.

==Prominent historical examples==
===Lex Titia and Second Triumvirate===
One of the first examples of rule by decree was in the ancient Roman Republic. After the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC, his successor Gaius Octavian (Augustus), general Mark Antony and succeeding pontifex maximus Aemilius Lepidus seized power in the Second Triumvirate, officially recognized by the senate by the Lex Titia decree. The resolution, which gave the three &#x27;triumvirs&#x27; authoritarian powers for five years, was enacted and reinstated consecutive in 38 BC. It finally collapsed in 33/32 BC, after the downfall of Lepidus, leading to the final Roman Republican civil war and the total collapse of republican government.

===Reichstag Fire Decree of 1933===
The most prominent example in history is the Reichstag Fire Decree in Germany, passed after the Reichstag building caught fire in 1933. German Chancellor Adolf Hitler convinced President Paul von Hindenburg to invoke Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution and issue a decree suspending basic civil rights indefinitely. As a result of this decree, German authorities were able to constitutionally suppress or imprison their opposition, which in turn paved the way for the one-party rule of the Nazi Party. The ensuing state of exception, which suspended the Constitution without formally repealing it, lasted until the end of the Third Reich in 1945.

===Indian Emergency (1975–1977)===
During the Indian Emergency in 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi pressured the President of India to declare a state of emergency, giving her absolute powers to rule by decree. Using these newfound powers, she nullified a regional court ruling which invalidated Gandhi&#x27;s election to parliament due to fraud and banned her from participating in elections for six years. After assuming near-dictatorial powers, she arrested thousands of opposition politicians, suspended habeas corpus and clamped down on press freedoms. In 1977, she agreed to hold elections again, which she lost resoundingly. She subsequently resigned as prime minister and party leader.

===Russian Constitutional Crisis (1993)===
From 23 September (given actual effect from 4 October after the armed disbanding of the Supreme Soviet) to 12 December 1993, rule by decree (ukase) was imposed in Russia by President Boris Yeltsin, during transition from the Russian Constitution of 1978 (which was modelled after the obsolete Soviet Constitution of 1977) to the current 1993 Constitution.

===Venezuela (2000–)===
Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez was granted executive power by the National Assembly to rule by decree multiple times throughout his tenure, passing hundreds of laws. Chávez ruled Venezuela by decree in 2000, 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Between 2004 and 2006 alone, Chávez declared 18 &quot;emergencies&quot; to rule by decree.

Chávez&#x27;s successor, Nicolás Maduro, has also ruled by decree multiple times since he was elected in April 2013. President Maduro has ruled Venezuela by decree for the majority of the period from 19 November 2013 through 2018.

==Legal situation==
Some democracies, such as Mexico, France and Argentina, permit presidential rule by decree in time of a national emergency, subject to constitutional and other legal limitations. In France, this power has been used only once, by Charles de Gaulle in 1961 during the Algerian War.

Other modern political concepts, such as the French decrees, Orders in Council in the British Commonwealth, and executive orders in the United States are partially based on this notion of decrees, although they are far more limited in scope and generally subject to judicial review.

Ireland&#x27;s Emergency Powers Act allows the government to rule by decrees called &quot;Emergency Powers Orders&quot; in any aspect of national life, if the parliament invokes the emergency clause in Article 28(3) of the Constitution. The Act however allows the Dáil Éireann to void specific EPOs in a free vote or end the state of emergency at any time.

==Giorgio Agamben&#x27;s critique of the use of decrees-law==
Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben has claimed that there has been an explosion in the use of various types of decrees (decree-law, presidential decrees, executive orders, etc.) since World War I. According to him, this is the sign of a &quot;generalization of the state of exception&quot;.

<doc id="206532" wikidata="Q655213" url="?curid=206532" title="Leigh Hunt">
<text>James Henry Leigh Hunt (19 October 178428 August 1859), best known as Leigh Hunt, was an English critic, essayist and poet.

Hunt co-founded &quot;The Examiner&quot;, a leading intellectual journal expounding radical principles. He was the centre of the Hampstead-based group that included William Hazlitt and Charles Lamb, known as the &quot;Hunt circle&quot;. Hunt also introduced John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Robert Browning and Alfred Tennyson to the public.

He may be best remembered for being sentenced to prison for two years on charges of libel against the Prince Regent (1813-1815).

Hunt&#x27;s presence at Shelley&#x27;s funeral on the beach near Viareggio was immortalised in the painting by Louis Édouard Fournier. Hunt inspired aspects of the Harold Skimpole character in Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;Bleak House&quot;.

==Early life==
James Henry Leigh Hunt was born on 19 October 1784, at Southgate, London, where his parents had settled after leaving the United States. His father, Isaac, a lawyer from Philadelphia, and his mother, Mary Shewell, a merchant&#x27;s daughter and a devout Quaker, had been forced to come to Britain because of their Loyalist sympathies during the American War of Independence.

Once in England, Isaac Hunt became a popular preacher but was unsuccessful in obtaining a permanent living. He was then employed by James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos, as tutor to his nephew, James Henry Leigh for whom Isaac named his son.

==Education==
Leigh Hunt was educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital in London from 1791 to 1799, a period that Hunt described in his autobiography. Thomas Barnes was a school friend. One of the boarding houses at Christ&#x27;s Hospital is named after Hunt.

As a boy, Hunt was an admirer of Thomas Gray and William Collins, writing many verses in imitation of them. A speech impediment, later cured, prevented Hunt from going to university. &quot;For some time after I left school,&quot; he says, &quot;I did nothing but visit my school-fellows, haunt the book-stalls and write verses.&quot;

Hunt&#x27;s first poems were published in 1801 under the title of &quot;Juvenilia&quot;, introducing him into British literary and theatrical society. He began to write for the newspapers and published in 1807 a volume of theatre criticism, and a series of &quot;Classic Tales&quot; with critical essays on the authors.

Hunt&#x27;s early essays were published by Edward Quin, editor and owner of &quot;The Traveller&quot;.

==Family==
In 1809, Leigh Hunt married Marianne Kent, whose parents were Thomas and Ann. Over the next 20 years, the couple had ten children: Thornton Leigh (1810–73), John Horatio Leigh (1812–46), Mary Florimel Leigh (1813–49), Swinburne Percy Leigh (1816–27), Percy Bysshe Shelley Leigh (1817–99), Henry Sylvan Leigh (1819–76), Vincent Leigh (1823–52), Julia Trelawney Leigh (1826–72), Jacyntha Leigh (1828–1914), and Arabella Leigh (1829–30).

Marianne Hunt, in poor health for most of her life, died on 26 January 1857, at the age of 69. Leigh Hunt made little mention of his family in his autobiography. Marianne&#x27;s sister, Elizabeth Kent (Hunt&#x27;s sister-in-law), became his amanuensis.

==Newspapers==
===&quot;The Examiner&quot;===
In 1808, Hunt left the War Office, where he had been working as a clerk, to become editor of &quot;The Examiner&quot;, a newspaper founded by his brother, John Hunt. His brother Robert Hunt contributed to its columns.

Robert Hunt&#x27;s criticism earned the enmity of William Blake, who described the office of &quot;The Examiner&quot; as containing a &quot;nest of villains&quot;. Blake&#x27;s response also included Leigh Hunt, who had published several vitriolic reviews in 1808 and 1809 and had added Blake&#x27;s name to a list of so-called &quot;quacks&quot;.

&quot;The Examiner&quot; soon acquired a reputation for unusual political independence; it would attack any worthy target &quot;from a principle of taste&quot;, as John Keats expressed it. In 1813 (or 1812), &quot;The Examiner&quot; attacked Prince Regent George, describing his physique as &quot;corpulent&quot;; the British government tried the three Hunt brothers and sentenced them to two years in prison. Leigh Hunt served his term at the Surrey County Gaol.

Leigh Hunt&#x27;s visitors at Surrey County Gaol included Lord Byron, Thomas Moore, Lord Henry Brougham, and Charles Lamb. The stoicism with which Leigh Hunt bore his imprisonment attracted general attention and sympathy. His imprisonment allowed him many luxuries and access to friends and family, and Lamb described his decorations of the cell as something not found outside a fairy tale. When Jeremy Bentham called on him, he found Hunt playing battledore.

From 1814 to 1817, Leigh Hunt and Hazlitt wrote a series of essays in &quot;The Examiner&quot; that they titled &quot;The Round Table&quot;. These essays were published in two volumes in 1817 in &quot;The Round Table&quot;. Twelve of the 52 essays were written by Hunt, the rest by Hazlitt.

===&quot;The Reflector&quot;===
From 1810 to 1812, Leigh Hunt edited a quarterly magazine, &quot;The Reflector&quot;, for his brother John. He wrote &quot;The Feast of the Poets&quot; for publication. His work was a satire that offended many contemporary poets, particularly William Gifford.

===&quot;The Indicator&quot;===
From 1819 to 1821, Hunt edited &quot;The Indicator&quot;, a weekly literary periodical that was published by Joseph Appleyard. Hunt probably wrote much of the content, which included reviews, essays, stories and poems.

===&quot;The Companion&quot;===
From January to July 1828, Hunt edited &quot;The Companion&quot;, a weekly literary periodical that was published by Hunt and Clarke. The journal dealt with books, theatrical productions and miscellaneous topics.

==Poetry==
In 1816, Hunt published the poem &quot;Story of Rimini&quot;. The work was based on the tragic episode of Francesca da Rimini, as told in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;.

Hunt&#x27;s preference was decidedly for Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s verse style, as adapted to Modern English by John Dryden. That was in contrast to the epigrammatic couplet of Alexander Pope. The &quot;Story of Rimini&quot; is an optimistic narrative that runs contrary to the tragic nature of its subject. Hunt&#x27;s flippancy and familiarity, often degenerating into the ludicrous, subsequently made him a target for ridicule and parody.

In 1818, Hunt published a collection of poems entitled &quot;Foliage&quot;, followed in 1819 by &quot;Hero and Leander&quot;, and &quot;Bacchus and Ariadne&quot;. In the same year, he reprinted &quot;The Story of Rimini&quot; and &quot;The Descent of Liberty&quot; with the title of &quot;Poetical Works&quot;. Hunt also started the &quot;Indicator&quot;.

Both Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley belonged to a literary group that gathered around Hunt at Hampstead. The Hunt Circle also included Hazlitt, Lamb, Bryan Procter, Benjamin Haydon, Charles Cowden Clarke, C. W. Dilke, Walter Coulson and John Hamilton Reynolds. The group was known pejoratively as the Cockney School.

Some of Hunt&#x27;s most popular poems are &quot;Jenny kiss&#x27;d Me&quot;, &quot;Abou Ben Adhem&quot; (1834) and &quot;A Night-Rain in Summer&quot;.

==Friendship with Keats and Shelley==
Hunt maintained close friendships with both Keats and Shelley. Financial help from Shelley saved Hunt from ruin. In return, Hunt provided Shelley with support during his family problems and defended him in &quot;The Examiner&quot;. Hunt introduced Keats to Shelley and wrote a very generous appreciation of him in &quot;The Indicator&quot;. Keats seemingly, however, later felt that Hunt&#x27;s example as a poet had been in some respects detrimental to him.

After Shelley&#x27;s departure for Italy in 1818, Hunt experienced more financial difficulties. In addition, both his health and that of his wife Marianne failed. As a result, Hunt was forced to discontinue &quot;The Indicator&quot; (1819–1821) and stated that he had &quot;almost died over the last numbers&quot;.

==Trip to Italy==
Shelley suggested that Hunt could join him and Byron in Italy to establish a quarterly magazine. The advantage was that they would be able to publish liberal opinions without repression from the British government. Byron&#x27;s motive for this proposal was allegedly to acquire more influence over &quot;The Examiner&quot; with Hunt out of England. However, Byron soon discovered that Hunt was no longer interested in &quot;The Examiner&quot;.

Hunt left England for Italy in November 1821, but storm, sickness, and misadventure delayed his arrival until 1 July 1822. Thomas Love Peacock compared their voyage to that of the character Ulysses in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

One week after Hunt arrived in Italy, Shelley died. Hunt was now virtually dependent upon Byron, who was not interested in supporting him and his family. Byron&#x27;s friends also scorned Hunt. The &quot;Liberal&quot; lived through four quarterly numbers, containing contributions no less memorable than Byron&#x27;s &quot;Vision of Judgment&quot; and Shelley&#x27;s translations from &quot;Faust&quot;.

In 1823, Byron left Italy for Greece, abandoning the quarterly. Hunt, remaining in Genoa, enjoyed the Italian climate and culture and stayed in Italy until 1825. Meanwhile, he created &quot;Ultra-Crepidarius: a Satire on William Gifford&quot; (1823), and his translation (1825) of Francesco Redi&#x27;s &quot;Bacco in Toscana&quot;.

==Return to England==
In 1825, a lawsuit with one of his brothers made Hunt return to England. In 1828, Hunt published &quot;Lord Byron and some of his Contemporaries&quot;. The work was designed to counter what Hunt perceived as an inaccurate public image of Byron. The public was shocked that Hunt, who had been obliged to Byron for so much, would &quot;bite the hand that fed him&quot;. Hunt especially writhed under the withering satire of Moore.

During his later years, Hunt continued to suffer from poverty and sickness. He worked unremittingly, but one effort failed after another. Two journalistic ventures, the &quot;Tatler&quot; (1830–1832), a daily devoted to literary and dramatic criticism, and &quot;London Journal&quot; (1834–1835) failed even though the latter contained some of his best writing. Hunt&#x27;s editorship (1837–1838) of the &quot;Monthly Repository&quot; was also unsuccessful.

In 1832, Hunt published by subscription a collected edition of his poems. The subscribers included many of his opponents. Also in 1832, Hunt printed for private circulation &quot;Christianism&quot;, the work afterward published (1853) as &quot;The Religion of the Heart&quot;. A copy sent to Thomas Carlyle secured his friendship, and Hunt went to live next door to him in Cheyne Row in 1833.

Hunt&#x27;s romance, &quot;Sir Ralph Esher&quot;, about Charles II was successful. &quot;Captain Sword and Captain Pen&quot;, published in 1835, a spirited contrast between the victories of peace and the victories of war, deserves to be ranked among his best poems.

In 1840, Hunt&#x27;s play &quot;Legend of Florence&quot; had a successful engagement at Covent Garden, which helped him financially. &quot;Lover&#x27;s Amazements&quot;, a comedy, was acted several years afterwards and was printed in &quot;Journal&quot; (1850–1851); other plays remained in manuscript.

Also in 1840, Hunt wrote introductory notices to the work of Richard Brinsley Sheridan and to Edward Moxon&#x27;s edition of the works of William Wycherley, William Congreve, John Vanbrugh and George Farquhar, a work that furnished the occasion of Macaulay&#x27;s essay on the Dramatists of the Restoration. A narrative poem, &quot;The Palfrey&quot;, was published in 1842.

During the 1830s, Hunt also wrote for the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;

==Final years==
In 1844 Mary Shelley and her son, on succeeding to the family estates, settled an annuity of £120 upon Hunt (Rossetti 1890). In 1847 Lord John Russell set up a pension of £200 for Hunt.

With his finances in better shape, Hunt published the companion books &quot;Imagination and Fancy&quot; (1844) and &quot;Wit and Humour&quot; (1846). These were two volumes of selections from English poets, which displayed his refined, discriminating critical tastes. Hunt also published a book on the pastoral poetry of Sicily, &quot;A Jar of Honey from Mount Hybla&quot; (1848). &quot;The Town&quot; (2 vols., 1848) and &quot;Men, Women and Books&quot; (2 vols., 1847) are partly made up from former material. &quot;The Old Court Suburb&quot; (2 vols., 1855; ed. A Dobson, 2002) is a sketch of Kensington, where Hunt long resided.

In 1850 Hunt published his &quot;Autobiography&quot; (3 vols.). It has been described as a naive and affected, but accurate, piece of self-portraiture. Hunt published &quot;A Book for a Corner&quot; (2 vols.) in 1849 and &quot;Table Talk&quot; appeared in 1851. In 1855, he published his narrative poems, both original and translated, under the title &quot;Stories in Verse&quot;.

Hunt died in Putney in London on 28 August 1859. He was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. In September 1966, Christ&#x27;s Hospital named one of its houses in the memory of Hunt. Today, a residential street in his birthplace of Southgate is named Leigh Hunt Drive in his honour.

==Depiction by Charles Dickens==

In a letter of 25 September 1853, Charles Dickens stated that Hunt had inspired the character of Harold Skimpole in &quot;Bleak House&quot;; &quot;I suppose he is the most exact portrait that was ever painted in words! ... It is an absolute reproduction of a real man&quot;. A contemporary critic commented, &quot;I recognized Skimpole instantaneously; ... and so did every person whom I talked with about it who had ever had Leigh Hunt&#x27;s acquaintance.&quot; G. K. Chesterton suggested that Dickens &quot;May never once have had the unfriendly thought, &#x27;Suppose Hunt behaved like a rascal!&#x27;; he may have only had the fanciful thought, &#x27;Suppose a rascal behaved like Hunt!&#x27;&quot; (Chesterton 1906).

His &quot;Poetical Works&quot; (2 vols.), revised by himself and edited by Lee, were printed at Boston in 1857, and an edition (London and New York) by his son, Thornton Hunt, appeared in 1860. Among volumes of selections are &quot;Essays&quot; (1887), ed. A. Symons; &quot;Leigh Hunt as Poet and Essayist&quot; (1889), ed. C. Kent; &quot;Essays and Poems&quot; (1891), ed. R. B. Johnson for the &quot;Temple Library&quot;.

Elizabeth Kent also incorporated many of his suggestions into her anonymously published 

Hunt&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography&quot; was revised shortly before his death, and edited (1859) by Thornton Hunt, who also arranged his &quot;Correspondence&quot; (2 vols., 1862). Additional letters were printed by the Cowden Clarkes in their &quot;Recollections of Writers&quot; (1878). The &quot;Autobiography&quot; was edited (2 vols., 1903) with full bibliographical note by Roger Ingpen.

A bibliography of Hunt&#x27;s works was compiled by Alexander Ireland (&quot;List of the Writings of William Hazlitt and Leigh Hunt&quot;, 1868). There are short lives of Hunt by Cosmo Monkhouse (&quot;Great Writers,&quot; 1893) and by RB Johnson (1896). Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Volume 28 (2004).

<doc id="206542" wikidata="Q6999" url="?curid=206542" title="Astronomical object">
<text>An astronomical object, celestial object, stellar object or heavenly body is a naturally occurring physical entity, association, or structure that exists within the observable universe. In astronomy, the terms &quot;object&quot; and &quot;body&quot; are often used interchangeably. However, an astronomical body or celestial body is a single, tightly bound, contiguous entity, while an astronomical or celestial &quot;object&quot; is a complex, less cohesively bound structure, which may consist of multiple bodies or even other objects with substructures.

Examples of astronomical objects include planetary systems, star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies, while asteroids, moons, planets, and stars are astronomical bodies. A comet may be identified as both a body and an object: It is a &quot;body&quot; when referring to the frozen nucleus of ice and dust, and an &quot;object&quot; when describing the entire comet with its diffuse coma and tail.

== History ==

Astronomical objects such as stars, planets, nebulae, asteroids and comets have been observed for thousands of years, although early cultures thought of these bodies as gods or deities. These early cultures found the movements of the bodies very important as they used these objects to help navigate over long distances, tell between the seasons, and to determine when to plant crops. During the Middle-Ages, cultures began to study the movements of these bodies more closely. Several astronomers of the Middle-East began to make detailed descriptions of stars and nebulae, and would make more accurate calendars based on the movements of these stars and planets. In Europe, astronomers focused more on devices to help study the celestial objects and creating textbooks, guides, and universities to teach people more about astronomy. 

During the Scientific Revolution, in 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus&#x27;s heliocentric model was published. This model described the Earth, along with all of the other planets as being astronomical bodies which orbited the Sun located in the center of the Solar System. Johannes Kepler discovered Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion, which are properties of the orbits that the astronomical bodies shared; this was used to improve the heliocentric model. In 1584, Giordano Bruno proposed that all distant stars are their own suns, being the first in centuries to suggest this idea. Galileo Galilei was one of the first astronomers to use telescopes to observe the sky, in 1610 he observed the four largest moons of Jupiter, now named the Galilean moons. Galileo also made observations of the phases of Venus, craters on the Moon, and sunspots on the Sun. Astronomer Edmond Halley was able to successfully predict the return of Halley&#x27;s Comet, which now bears his name, in 1758. In 1781, Sir William Herschel discovered the new planet Uranus, being the first discovered planet not visible by the naked eye. 

In the 19th and 20th century, new technologies and scientific innovations allowed scientists to greatly expand their understanding of astronomy and astronomical objects. Larger telescopes and observatories began to be built and scientists began to print images of the Moon and other celestial bodies on photographic plates. New wavelengths of light unseen by the human eye were discovered, and new telescopes were made that made it possible to see astronomical objects in other wavelengths of light. Joseph von Fraunhofer and Angelo Secchi pioneered the field of spectroscopy, which allowed them to observe the composition of stars and nebulae, and many astronomers were able to determine the masses of binary stars based on their orbital elements. Computers began to be used to observe and study massive amounts of astronomical data on stars, and new technologies such as the photoelectric photometer allowed astronomers to accurately measure the color and luminosity of stars, which allowed them to predict their temperature and mass. In 1913, the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram was developed by astronomers Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell independently of each other, which plotted stars based on their luminosity and color and allowed astronomers to easily examine stars. It was found that stars commonly fell on a band of stars called the main-sequence stars on the diagram. A refined scheme for stellar classification was published in 1943 by William Wilson Morgan and Philip Childs Keenan based on the Hertzsprung-Russel Diagram. Astronomers also began debating whether other galaxies existed beyond the Milky Way, these debates ended when Edwin Hubble identified the Andromeda nebula as a different galaxy, along with many others far from the Milky Way.

== Galaxy and larger ==
The universe can be viewed as having a hierarchical structure. At the largest scales, the fundamental component of assembly is the galaxy. Galaxies are organized into groups and clusters, often within larger superclusters, that are strung along great filaments between nearly empty voids, forming a web that spans the observable universe.

Galaxies have a variety of morphologies, with irregular, elliptical and disk-like shapes, depending on their formation and evolutionary histories, including interaction with other galaxies, which may lead to a merger. Disc galaxies encompass lenticular and spiral galaxies with features, such as spiral arms and a distinct halo. At the core, most galaxies have a supermassive black hole, which may result in an active galactic nucleus. Galaxies can also have satellites in the form of dwarf galaxies and globular clusters.

The constituents of a galaxy are formed out of gaseous matter that assembles through gravitational self-attraction in a hierarchical manner. At this level, the resulting fundamental components are the stars, which are typically assembled in clusters from the various condensing nebulae. The great variety of stellar forms are determined almost entirely by the mass, composition and evolutionary state of these stars. Stars may be found in multi-star systems that orbit about each other in a hierarchical organization. A planetary system and various minor objects such as asteroids, comets and debris, can form in a hierarchical process of accretion from the protoplanetary disks that surround newly formed stars.

The various distinctive types of stars are shown by the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (H–R diagram)—a plot of absolute stellar luminosity versus surface temperature. Each star follows an evolutionary track across this diagram. If this track takes the star through a region containing an intrinsic variable type, then its physical properties can cause it to become a variable star. An example of this is the instability strip, a region of the H-R diagram that includes Delta Scuti, RR Lyrae and Cepheid variables. The evolving star may eject some portion of its atmosphere to form a nebula, either steadily to form a planetary nebula or in a supernova explosion that leaves a remnant. Depending on the initial mass of the star and the presence or absence of a companion, a star may spend the last part of its life as a compact object; either a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole.

==Shape==

The IAU definitions of planet and dwarf planet require that a Sun-orbiting astronomical body has undergone the rounding process to reach a roughly spherical shape, an achievement known as hydrostatic equilibrium. The same spheroidal shape can be seen on smaller rocky planets like Mars to gas giants like Jupiter.

Any natural Sun-orbiting body that has not reached hydrostatic equilibrium is classified by the IAU as a small Solar System body (SSSB). These come in many non-spherical shapes which are lumpy masses accreted haphazardly by in-falling dust and rock; not enough mass falls in to generate the heat needed to complete the rounding. Some SSSBs are just collections of relatively small rocks that are weakly held next to each other by gravity but are not actually fused into a single big bedrock. Some larger SSSBs are nearly round but have not reached hydrostatic equilibrium. The small Solar System body 4 Vesta is large enough to have undergone at least partial planetary differentiation.

Stars like the Sun are also spheroidal due to gravity&#x27;s effects on their plasma, which is a free-flowing fluid. Ongoing stellar fusion is a much greater source of heat for stars compared to the initial heat released during their formation.

<text>Antti Hulkko (born 11 October 1962), better known as Andy McCoy, is a Finnish musician. He is best known for his role as the lead guitarist and main songwriter of the rock band Hanoi Rocks, but has also played with Iggy Pop and a variety of other groups. McCoy&#x27;s works cover a wide range of music genres, including rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, punk rock, flamenco, glam punk, glam rock, blues rock and hard rock. He is also an avid painter.

==Biography==

===Hanoi Rocks (1979–1985, 2001–2009)===

Before Hanoi Rocks, McCoy had become well known in his home country, Finland, due to his work in the punk rock band Pelle Miljoona Oy. During this time McCoy was talking with Matti Fagerholm (better known as Michael Monroe) to start a band of their own, but because McCoy was currently in Pelle Miljoona Oy, he told Monroe to start the band without him in 1979. After McCoy left Pelle Miljoona Oy, he then joined Monroe in Hanoi Rocks, with another former-Pelle Miljoona Oy member, Sam Yaffa. At this point, the Hanoi Rocks line-up consisted of Michael Monroe (lead vocals), Andy McCoy (lead guitar), Nasty Suicide (rhythm guitar), Sam Yaffa (bass) and Swedish Gyp Casino (drums).

Hanoi Rocks released their first album in 1981 titled &quot;Bangkok Shocks, Saigon Shakes, Hanoi Rocks&quot;, with nine out of ten tracks written by McCoy. The album was produced by Andy McCoy and Michael Monroe who were known as &quot;The Muddy Twins&quot;. In 1982 Hanoi Rocks recorded and released their second studio album &quot;Oriental Beat&quot; in London. The original cover&#x27;s back side featured Andy McCoy&#x27;s then girlfriend Anna&#x27;s naked breasts painted blue and red with &quot;Hanoi Roxx&quot; written across it. After the album&#x27;s release, the band moved to London the same year, and subsequently fired drummer Gyp Casino before hiring Hanoi Rocks fan Nicholas Dingley, better known as Razzle, as drummer. The line-up with Razzle is considered the definitive version of Hanoi Rocks. Later that year the band released &quot;Self Destruction Blues&quot;, which had Razzle on the cover, but he didn&#x27;t play on the album, because it was actually a compilation of old singles. The tour for the album took the band to Asia for the first time. The next year 1983, the band released &quot;Back to Mystery City&quot; and after that, in 1984, the band worked with producer Bob Ezrin, and released &quot;Two Steps from the Move&quot;. Before this, McCoy had written most of the songs by himself, but for this album Bob Ezrin helped McCoy with the writing, along with Monroe. He also got some help with the lyrics from legendary Ian Hunter (of Mott The Hoople). After Razzle&#x27;s death, Sam Yaffa left the band due to personal differences with McCoy (amongst other reasons he was now engaged to Anna, McCoy&#x27;s former girlfriend known from the &quot;Oriental Beat&quot; cover). The band tried out new members (amongst them The Clash ex-drummer Terry Chimes and bassist René Berg), but things didn&#x27;t work out, so the band disbanded in 1985.

In 2001 McCoy and Michael Monroe started working together again and decided to reform Hanoi Rocks with two new members on guitar and bass, with Michael Monroe&#x27;s solo career drummer, Lacu. They released &quot;Twelve Shots on the Rocks&quot; that same year. In 2005 they released &quot;Another Hostile Takeover&quot; with new members Andy Christell on bass and Conny Bloom on guitar (both formerly of the Electric Boys). In 2007 the band released the album &quot;Street Poetry&quot;. In 2008 Andy McCoy and Michael Monroe stated that they had taken the band as far as they could and so they decided to end the band. Hanoi Rocks played 8 sold out farewell gigs in 6 days at Tavastia Club, Helsinki. The original guitarist Nasty Suicide appeared as a special guest on three of the last gigs.

===Other work (1985–1999, 2009–2019)===

After Hanoi Rocks&#x27; break-up in 1985, McCoy continued with his next project &quot;The Cherry Bombz&quot; which featured the last Hanoi line-up (except Michael Monroe), which consisted of Nasty Suicide, drummer Terry Chimes, bass player Timo Kaltio and vocalist Anita Chellemah of Toto Coelo fame (previously scoring a hit with &quot;I Eat Cannibals&quot;). The band was perceived as being the next stage of Hanoi Rocks. The music of The Cherry Bombz was actually very similar to that of Hanoi Rocks. The band played a handful of shows in Europe and in the United States in 1985 and 1986 and released two EPs and a live album and video, but never a full-length studio album. In 1986, Timo Kaltio was replaced by bassist Dave Tregunna (Sham 69, Lords of the New Church), but the group broke up the next year.

McCoy also worked with Nasty Suicide under the moniker &quot;The Suicide Twins&quot; and released the album &quot;Silver Missiles And Nightingales&quot; (which was the original working tile for &quot;Two Steps from the Move&quot;) in 1986, which also featured a guest appearance by René Berg. &quot;The Suicide Twins&quot; project disbanded in 1987

McCoy spent the rest of 1987 not doing much, except releasing his memoir titled &quot;Andy McCoy – From Hanoi to Eternity&quot;, but nothing else. In 1988 McCoy released his first solo-album titled &quot;Too Much Ain&#x27;t Enough.&quot; For the rest of 1988 McCoy did some acoustic gigs in Finland, moved to London and then to Los Angeles. Next McCoy struck a record deal with BMG. McCoy also became the first Finnish artist to have a gold record in the US, when Samantha Fox recorded a cover of The Suicide Twins&#x27; song &quot;The Best Is Yet to Come&quot;. The rest of 1988 and some of 1989 McCoy spent touring as the guitarist for Iggy Pop. In 1989 McCoy appeared on the U.K. Subs&#x27; album &quot;Killing Time&quot;.

In the beginning of the 1990s, McCoy lived in Los Angeles with his son and new girlfriend, Johnny Thunders&#x27; cousin Angela Nicoletti (former girlfriend of Izzy Stradlin). McCoy formed the band Shooting Gallery and married Angela in October 1991. Shooting Gallery toured as an opening act for Kiss during a U.S. tour and also released an album in 1992, before breaking-up that same year. Shooting Gallery shortly came back and toured in Finland with Gyp Casino on drums in 1994, but again disbanded that same year.

In 1995 McCoy&#x27;s second solo-album &quot;Building on Tradition&quot; was released and, aside from Hanoi Rocks, it became McCoy&#x27;s biggest success. The album&#x27;s biggest hit &quot;Strung Out&quot; was originally meant for Shooting Gallery, but it was not recorded until the second solo-album. For the tour for &quot;Building on Tradition&quot;, McCoy assembled the band Live Ammo, which featured McCoy (guitar, vocals), Angela McCoy (vocals), Dan Lagerstedt (guitar, vocals), Andy Christell (bass), Gyp Casino (drums) and Christian André (keyboards). Christell had to soon leave the band for family reasons, so Lagerstedt started to play bass. André was also fired from the band, and they soon disbanded.

Also in 1995, McCoy appeared on The 69 Eyes&#x27; songs &quot;Vietnamese Baby&quot; and the song &quot;Wild Talk&quot; from the album Savage Garden. Next McCoy returned to his childhood passion: painting (which he still does).

In 1996, McCoy and Pete Malmi reformed their old band Briard after 20 years. The new Briard (which also included Angela McCoy) released a new album simply titled &quot;Briard&quot;. That same year filmmaker Pekka Lehto started the filming for the movie &quot;The Real McCoy&quot;, a half-real, half-fictional bio-pic on McCoy. The film was released in 1999.

After Hanoi officially ended in 2009, Andy McCoy formed a band called &quot;The Real McCoy Band&quot;, but this band broke up after just three shows, when guitarist Chris Shiflett returned to the US after his son contracted swine flu.

After 2009, McCoy was recruited as lead guitarist for Grease Helmet, a new Helsinki-based band. The first album of the band was released in September 2012. Besides working with Grease Helmet, McCoy has also performed with several other bands including the new band for a Finnish punk singer, Pelle Miljoona (which he had played before joining Hanoi Rocks) as well as Bam Margera&#x27;s band in which he toured in Australia in 2015.

McCoy released an EP &quot;Soul Satisfaction&quot; in December 2018 and toured with Pelle Miljoona Oy from November 2018 to late August 2019. The band released a new EP called &quot;Anna soihtusi palaa&quot; (&quot;Let your torch burn)&quot; in October 2018 with McCoy on the guitar&quot;.&quot; McCoy released a new single &quot;Seven Seas&quot; on 15 August 2019, with the announcement of a tour starting in 2020 and a full album release on 27 September the same year. He also hosted an art exhibition with an acoustic gig at Hard Rock Cafe in Helsinki on the release day of the single &quot;Seven Seas.&quot;

==Personal life==
McCoy was born in Pelkosenniemi, Finland, but grew up in Stockholm, Sweden. His mother was Finnish and Swedish, and McCoy has stated that his paternal grandfather was a Romani musician who taught him &quot;gypsy and flamenco guitar&quot; in his childhood, but in a 2012 interview his brother Ilkka Hulkko denied the Roma roots and described their ”grandfather Eino” as ”a good accordion player but not a Romani”.

Besides music, Andy McCoy is an avid painter and he also makes a lot of his own and his wife&#x27;s clothes, along with designing jewellery, scarfs and other accessories. McCoy held his first Art Exhibition &quot;McCoy Hits Canvas&quot; at The Cable Factory in Helsinki in 2010.

On 27 July 2009 a statue of McCoy (sculpted in wood by Matti Hulkko) was erected in the main square of Pelkosenniemi. All proceeds went to charity for newcomers in the music business.

McCoy&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Sheriff McCoy: Outlaw Legend of Hanoi Rocks&quot; was published in English translation on 17 September 2009 by Bazillion Points Books.

McCoy was previously married to Anastasia Maisonneuve, the ex-girlfriend of his Hanoi Rocks bandmate Michael Monroe, and the former common-law wife of musician Stiv Bators. She and McCoy have a son together. McCoy was married to Angela Nicoletti between 1991 and 2021.

McCoy entered Finland&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; on 3 September 2013.

==Legacy==
When Acey Slade was asked &quot;Who is the best guitarist in rock right now?&quot; He replied: &quot;Andy McCoy. Period. When Dave Grohl met Andy McCoy, he said &#x27;I have met my first rockstar.&#x27; That&#x27;s a pretty good reason.&quot;

McCoy is a friend of Bam Margera (professional skater and &quot;Jackass&quot; star). McCoy made appearances in &quot;Viva la Bam&quot; and &quot;Bam Margera Presents: Where the#$&amp;% Is Santa?&quot;, and appeared several times on radio Bam. Margera has a tattoo of McCoy on his right arm.

<text>Solar maximum is the regular period of greatest solar activity during the Sun&#x27;s 11-year solar cycle. During solar maximum, large numbers of sunspots appear, and the solar irradiance output grows by about 0.07%. On average, the solar cycle takes about 11 years to go from one solar maximum to the next, with duration observed varying from 9 to 14 years.

Large solar storms often occur during solar maximum. For example, the Carrington Event, which took place a few months before the solar maximum of solar cycle 10, was the most intense geomagnetic storm in recorded history and widely considered to have been caused by an equally large solar storm.

==Predictions==
Predictions of a future maximum&#x27;s timing and strength are very difficult; predictions vary widely. There was a solar maximum in 2000. In 2006, NASA initially expected a solar maximum in 2010 or 2011, and thought that it could be the strongest since 1958. However, the solar maximum was not declared to have occurred until 2014, and even then was ranked among the weakest on record.

==Grand solar minima and maxima==

In addition to the ~11 year solar cycle, the intensity of the solar maxima can vary from cycle to cycle. When several solar cycles exhibit greater than average activity for decades or centuries, this period is labelled &quot;Grand solar maximum&quot;. Solar cycles still occur during these grand solar maximum periods, but the intensity of those cycles is greater. Likewise, extended periods in which the solar maximum is lower than average are labeled &quot;grand solar minima&quot;. Some researchers suggest that grand solar maxima have shown some correlation with global and regional climate changes, although others dispute this hypothesis (&quot;e.g.&quot;, see Medieval Warm Period).

Following the advent of telescopic solar observation with Galileo&#x27;s 1611 observations, the intensity of solar maxima is typically measured by counting numbers and size of sunspots; for periods previous to this, isotope ratios in ice cores can be used to estimate solar activity. The table below shows the approximate dates of some of the proposed solar minima in historical times.

A proposed list of historical Grand minima of solar activity includes also Grand minima ca. 690 AD, 360 BC, 770 BC, 1390 BC, 2860 BC, 3340 BC, 3500 BC, 3630 BC, 3940 BC, 4230 BC, 4330 BC, 5260 BC, 5460 BC, 5620 BC, 5710 BC, 5990 BC, 6220 BC, 6400 BC, 7040 BC, 7310 BC, 7520 BC, 8220 BC, 9170 BC.

<doc id="206552" wikidata="Q1265287" url="?curid=206552" title="USS Wisconsin (BB-64)">
<text>USS &quot;Wisconsin&quot; (BB-64) is an built for the United States Navy (USN) in the 1940s and is currently a museum ship. Completed in 1944, the ship was assigned to the Pacific Theater during World War II, where she participated in the Philippines campaign and the Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. The battleship shelled the Japanese home islands shortly before the end of the war in September 1945. During the Korean War, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; shelled North Korean targets in support of United Nations and South Korean ground operations, after which she was decommissioned. She was reactivated in 1986; after a modernization program, she participated in Operation Desert Storm in January – February 1991.

&quot;Wisconsin&quot; was last decommissioned in September 1991 after spending a total of 14 years in active service. In that time, the ship earned six battle stars for service in World War II and Korea, as well as a Navy Unit Commendation for service during the January/February 1991 Gulf War. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 17 March 2006, and was later donated for permanent use as a museum ship. , &quot;Wisconsin&quot; is a museum ship operated by Nauticus in Norfolk, Virginia.

==Background and description==

The &quot;Iowa&quot; class of fast battleships was designed in the late 1930s in response to the US Navy&#x27;s expectations for a future war with the Empire of Japan. The last battleships to be built by the United States, they were also the US Navy&#x27;s largest and fastest vessels of the type. American officers preferred comparatively slow but heavily armed and armored battleships, but Navy planners determined that such a fleet would have difficulty in bringing the faster Japanese fleet to battle, particularly the s and the aircraft carriers of the 1st Air Fleet. Design studies prepared during the development of the earlier and es demonstrated the difficulty in resolving the desires of fleet officers with those of the planning staff within the displacement limits imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty system, which had governed capital ship construction since 1923. An escalator clause in the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936 allowed an increase from to in the event that any member nation refused to sign the treaty, which Japan refused to do.

&quot;Wisconsin&quot; is long overall and is long at the waterline. The ship has a beam of and a draft of at her full combat load of . The &quot;Iowa&quot;-class ships are powered by four General Electric geared steam turbines, each driving one screw propeller using steam provided by eight oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were designed to give a top speed of , but were built to handle a 20 percent overload. None of the &quot;Iowa&quot;s ever ran speed trials in deep water, but the Bureau of Ships estimated that they could reach a speed of about from at a light displacement of . The ships had a designed cruising range of at a speed of , although &quot;Wisconsin&quot;″s half sister &#x27;s fuel consumption figures during her sea trials suggest that her range was at least at that cruising speed. Their designed crew numbered 117 officers and 1,804 enlisted men, and greatly increased by the end of the war in 1945. &quot;Wisconsin&quot;″s crew at that time numbered 173 officers and 2,738 sailors.

===Armament, fire control, sensors and aircraft===
The main battery of the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class ships consisted of nine /50-caliber Mark 7 guns in three triple-gun turrets on the centerline, two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward of the superstructure, with the third aft. Going from bow to stern, the turrets were designated I, II, and III. Their secondary battery consisted of twenty /38-caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin-gun turrets clustered amidships, five turrets on each broadside. Unlike their half sisters and &quot;New Jersey&quot; that were the first pair of ships built, and &quot;Wisconsin&quot; were completed with an anti-aircraft suite of twenty quadruple mounts for Bofors AA guns, nine mounts on each broadside and one each on the roofs of Turrets II and III. Forty-nine Oerlikon light AA auto-cannon in single mounts were distributed almost the length of the ships.

The primary means of controlling the main armament are two Mark 38 directors for the Mark 38 fire-control system mounted at the tops of the fore and aft fire-control towers in the superstructure. These directors were equipped with rangefinders, although their primary sensor was the Mark 8 fire-control radar mounted on their roofs. A secondary Mark 40 fire-control director was installed inside the armored conning tower at the front of the superstructure that used the Mark 27 fire-control radar positioned on the top of the conning tower. Each turret is fitted with a rangefinder long and can act as a director for the other turrets. Four Mark 37 gunnery directors, two on the centerline at the ends of the superstructure and one on each broadside, control the five-inch guns. Each director was equipped with a rangefinder and a pair of radars on its roof. These were a Mark 12 fire-control system and a Mark 22 height-finder radar. Each 40 mm mount was remotely controlled by a Mark 51 director that incorporated a Mark 14 lead-computing gyro gunsight while the sailors that used the 20 mm gun used a Mark 14 sight to track their targets.

A SK-2 early-warning radar was fitted on the ship&#x27;s foremast; above it was a SG surface-search radar. The other SG radar was mounted at the top of the mainmast positioned on the rear funnel.

The &quot;Iowa&quot;s were built with two rotating aircraft catapults on their stern for floatplanes and a large crane was fitted to recover them. Initially a trio of Vought OS2U Kingfishers were carried, but these were replaced by Curtiss SC Seahawks in December 1944.

===Protection===
The internal waterline armor belt of the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class ships is thick and has a height of . Below it is a strake of Class B homogeneous armor plate that tapers in thickness from 12.1 inches at the top to at the bottom and is high. The two strakes of armor are inclined outwards at the top 19 degrees to improve the armor&#x27;s resistance to horizontal fire. In general the vertical armor plates are made from Class A cemented armor and the horizontal armor from Class B or Special treatment steel (STS). The belt armor extends to the two transverse bulkheads fore and aft of the main-gun barbettes, forming the armored citadel. Part of the lower armor belt extends aft from the rear bulkhead to protect the ships&#x27; steering gear. Its maximum thickness ranges from at the top and the plates taper to 5 inches at the bottom. Unlike the &quot;Iowa&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot;, the armor plates in the forward transverse bulkhead in &quot;Missouri&quot; and &quot;Wisconsin&quot; have a maximum thickness of at the top that tapers to . The aft bulkhead is a consistent 14.5 inches in thickness, but does not go below the lower belt extension due it meeting the armored third deck protecting the shafts and steering gears; the steering gear is closed by another 14.5-inch aft bulkhead.

The main-gun turrets have Class B plates thick on their faces and of Class A plates on their sides. The armor plates protecting their barbettes range in thickness from to and with the thickest plates on the sides and the thinnest ones on the front and back. The sides of the conning tower are thick. The main deck of the &quot;Iowa&quot;s consists of of STS. Below this deck, the roof of the armored citadel is formed by of armor in two layers. Below this is a deck of STS plates intended to stop splinters from shells that pierced the armored deck above it. The armor deck extends aft and the roof of the steering gear compartment is thick.

The underwater protection system of the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships consists of three watertight compartments outboard of the lower armor belt and another behind it. The two outermost compartment are kept loaded with fuel oil or seawater to absorb the energy of the torpedo warhead&#x27;s detonation and slow the resulting splinters so they can be stopped by the lower armor belt. Behind the belt is a holding bulkhead intended to protect the ships&#x27; inner spaces from any splinters that might penetrate and the subsequent flooding. For protection against naval mines, the &quot;Iowa&quot;s have a double bottom that runs the full length of the ships and increases to a triple bottom except at the bow and stern.

==History==
===Construction===
&quot;Wisconsin&quot; was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named after the US state of Wisconsin. The ship was authorized by Congress in 1938 and ordered on 12 June 1940 with the hull number BB-64. Her keel was laid down on 25 January 1941, at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. She was launched on 7 December 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Goodland, wife of Walter S. Goodland, the Governor of Wisconsin, and commissioned on 16 April 1944, with Captain Earl E. Stone in command.

&quot;Wisconsin&quot; is numerically the highest-numbered US battleship built. Although her keel was laid after &quot;Missouri&quot;″s, she was commissioned before &quot;Missouri&quot;″s commissioning date. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; was commissioned on 16 April 1944, while &quot;Missouri&quot; was commissioned on 11 June of the same year. Thus, &quot;Wisconsin&quot;″s construction began after &quot;Missouri&quot;″s, and finished earlier. &quot;Iowa&quot; and &quot;Wisconsin&quot; were finally stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 17 March 2006, making them the last battleships in service in the world.

===World War II (1944–1945)===

====Shakedown and service with 3rd Fleet, Admiral Halsey====

After the ship&#x27;s trials and initial training in the Chesapeake Bay, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; departed Norfolk, Virginia, on 7 July 1944, bound for the British West Indies. Following her shakedown cruise (conducted out of Trinidad), she returned to the builder&#x27;s yard for alterations and repairs. On 24 September, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; sailed for the West Coast, transiting the Panama Canal, and reporting for duty with the Pacific Fleet on 2 October. The battleship later steamed to Hawaiian waters for training exercises and then headed for the Western Caroline Islands. Rear Admiral Edward Hanson, commander of Battleship Division 9, hoisted his flag aboard &quot;Wisconsin&quot; on 25 November. Shortly after reaching Ulithi, she was assigned to Task Group (TG) 38.2, part of Admiral William F. Halsey&#x27;s 3rd Fleet&#x27;s Fast Carrier Task Force (TF 38), on 11 December. Her primary duty was to serve as part of the anti-aircraft screen for the carriers. In addition to guarding the carriers, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; and the other battleships acted as oilers for the escorting destroyers, since the fleet&#x27;s logistics train could not accompany the strike force during raids. The battleship arrived in time to participate in the Philippines campaign. As a part of that operation, the planners had envisioned landings on the southwest coast of Mindoro, south of Luzon, which would allow American forces to interdict Japanese lines of communication through the South China Sea.
The carriers had just completed three days of heavy raids against Japanese airfields, suppressing enemy aircraft during the amphibious operations against Mindoro and had withdrawn to begin refueling at sea on 17 December about east of Luzon in the Philippine Sea. The task force was struck by Typhoon Cobra the following day. The small but violent typhoon surprised the task force while many of the ships were attempting to refuel. Three destroyers capsized while nine other ships were seriously damaged.&quot;Wisconsin&quot; was not damaged, but reported two injured sailors as a result of the typhoon.

TF 38 attacked Japanese airfields in Formosa, Okinawa, and the Sakishima Islands with TG 38.2 tasked to cover southern Formosa and the Pescadore Islands beginning on 3 January 1945 to destroy aircraft that the Japanese had concentrated there to attack any amphibious landings on Luzon Island. The Americans caught the Japanese by surprise and claimed to have destroyed 170 aircraft that had been unable to take-off due to bad weather in two days of airstrikes. TF 38 withdrew to refuel on 5 January while the Japanese aircraft based on Luzon were attacking the ships of the 7th Fleet with some effect. The 7th Fleet was approaching Lingayen Gulf to conduct an amphibious landing of Luzon.

TF 38 was able to so thoroughly suppress the airfields on Luzon on 6–7 January that the landings were undisrupted by Japanese aircraft when they began on 9 January. The ships refueled on 8 January while moving northwards for another round of attacks on Formosa and Okinawa that began the following day with TG 38.2 this time attacking northern Formosa. This time they also attacked Japanese shipping. The task force entered the South China Sea on the night of 9/10 January to execute the next phase of Halsey&#x27;s plan to interdict Japanese shipping lanes and destroy the Japanese forces defending the area, specifically including any capital ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, as naval intelligence had reported two hybrid carrier/battleships, and , at Cam Ranh Bay in occupied French Indochina.

Halsey tasked &quot;Wisconsin&quot;″s carrier group with closing to of the Indochinese coast on 12 January while the rest of TF 38 supported TG 38.2 and attacked other targets further north. Halsey also formed a surface action group from TG 38.2 with &quot;Wisconsin&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot; and five cruisers to bombard Cam Ranh Bay under cover of the morning&#x27;s airstrikes, but night reconnaissance aircraft revealed well before dawn that the two hybrids were no longer there and their mission was canceled. They resumed their escort duties, but surprise was complete and no Japanese aircraft attacked TG 38.2. TF 38 withdrew shortly after sunset and refueled the following day in the middle of the South China Sea despite another typhoon in the area.

Formosa was raided again on 15 January, and 21 January. Throughout January &quot;Wisconsin&quot; shielded the carriers as they conducted air raids at Hong Kong, Canton, Hainan Island, the Canton oil refineries, the Hong Kong Naval Station, and Okinawa.

====Service with 5th Fleet, Admiral Spruance====

&quot;Wisconsin&quot; was assigned to the 5th Fleet when Admiral Raymond A. Spruance relieved Admiral Halsey as commander of the fleet while it was anchored in Ulithi. She moved northward with the redesignated TG 58.2 as the carriers departed for the Tokyo area on 10 February. The ship was transferred to TF 59 under Vice Admiral Willis Lee three days later, covering the carriers of TF 58 as they attacked targets around Tokyo and on Chichijima between 16 and 25 February to prevent the Japanese from reinforcing Iwo Jima. On 20 February Captain John W. Roper relieved Stone, and the 5th Fleet arrived back at Ulithi on 4 March to resupply.

Still assigned to TF 59, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; departed Ulithi on 14 March bound for Japan. Their mission was to neutralize or destroy aircraft, their airfields and warships that could interfere with the invasion of Okinawa (Operation Iceberg) that was scheduled for 1 April. On 24 March, the ship joined &quot;Missouri&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot; as they bombarded targets in southeastern Okinawa to deceive the Japanese about the location of the intended landing beaches, which were actually on the western coast. Five days later, a crewman aboard &quot;Missouri&quot; was wounded by a 20 mm shell from &quot;Wisconsin&quot; as a Japanese aircraft flew between the ships at low level.

&quot;Wisconsin&quot; and &quot;Missouri&quot; were transferred to TG 58.4 afterwards and they resumed their primary duty of protecting the aircraft carriers. The ships returned to Ulithi on 14 May where they replenished their supplies and ammunition before setting off for Okinawa again on 24 May. Halsey relieved Spruance on 28 May and the units switched designations accordingly. The task group avoided a typhoon that shut down air operations from 4 to 7 June. The following day the carriers&#x27; aircraft attacked targets on Kyūshū, southernmost of the Japanese Home Islands. One of &quot;Wisconsin&quot;″s floatplanes rescued a pilot from the carrier that day. TF 38 headed to Leyte, Philippines, on 11 June and arrived there two days later. The battleship received repairs over the following three weeks while restocking ammunition and supplies.

====Bombardment of Japan====
Accompanied by her sisters &quot;Iowa&quot; and &quot;Missouri&quot; in TG 38.4, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; departed on 1 July for operations in Japanese home waters and the carriers commenced their attacks 9 days later. On 15 July the three battleships bombarded the blast furnaces and other facilities of the Japan Steel Works as well the coal liquefication plants and coking ovens in Muroran and adjacent Wanishi, Hokkaido, with 860 main-gun shells. While only 170 landed within the boundaries of the plants they demolished half of the coke ovens and all but one of the blast furnaces. Reinforced by the British battleship and the American battleships and , the sisters bombarded industrial facilities in the Hitachi Miro area, northeast of Tokyo with a total of 1,207 16- and 267 shells. The attack reduced copper output from per month.

Afterward the ships returned to the carrier groups, resuming their tasks of covering them from attack. The Japanese surrendered on 15 August, ending World War II. &quot;&quot;Wisconsin&quot;, as part of the occupying force, arrived at Tokyo Bay on 5 September, three days after the formal surrender occurred on board the &quot;Missouri&quot;. During &quot;Wisconsin&quot;″s brief career in World War II, she had steamed since commissioning, shot down three enemy planes, claimed assists on four occasions, and fueled her screening destroyers on some 250 occasions.&quot;

====Post World War II (1945–1950)====
Shifting subsequently to Okinawa, the battleship embarked homeward-bound GIs on 22 September 1945, as part of Operation Magic Carpet staged to bring soldiers, sailors, and marines home from the far-flung battlefronts of the Pacific. Departing Okinawa on 23 September, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; reached Pearl Harbor on 4 October, remaining there for five days before she pushed on for the West Coast on the last leg of her state-side bound voyage. She reached San Francisco on 15 October.

Heading for the East Coast of the United States soon after the start of the new year, 1946, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; transited the Panama Canal from 11 to 13 January and reached Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 18 January. Following a cruise south to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, the battleship entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for overhaul. After repairs and alterations that consumed the summer, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; sailed for South American waters. Over the weeks that ensued, the battleship visited Valparaíso, Chile, from 1–6 November; Callao, Peru, from 9–13 November; Balboa, Canal Zone, from 16 to 20 November; and La Guaira, Venezuela, from 22 to 26 November, before returning to Norfolk on 2 December 1946. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; spent nearly all of 1947 as a training ship, taking naval reservists on two-week cruises throughout the year. Those voyages commenced at Bayonne, New Jersey, and saw visits conducted at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and the Panama Canal Zone. While underway at sea, the ship would perform various drills and exercises before the cruise would end where it had started, at Bayonne. During June and July 1947, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; took United States Naval Academy midshipmen on cruises to northern European waters. In January 1948, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; reported to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Norfolk for inactivation. Placed out of commission, in reserve on 1 July, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; was assigned to the Norfolk group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

===Korean War (1950–1952)===
Her sojourn in &quot;mothballs&quot; was rather brief, due to the North Korean invasion of South Korea in late June 1950. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; was recommissioned on 3 March 1951 with Captain Thomas Burrowes in command. After shakedown training, the revitalized battleship conducted two midshipmen training cruises, taking the officers-to-be to Edinburgh, Scotland; Lisbon, Portugal; Halifax, Nova Scotia; New York City and Guantánamo Bay, Cuba before she returned to Norfolk.

&quot;Wisconsin&quot; departed Norfolk on 25 October, bound for the Pacific. She transited the Panama Canal on 29 October and reached Yokosuka, Japan on 21 November. There she relieved &quot;New Jersey&quot; as flagship for Vice Admiral Harold M. Martin, Commander 7th Fleet.

On 26 November, with Martin and Rear Admiral Francis Denebrink, Commander, Service Force Pacific embarked, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; departed Yokosuka for Korean waters to support the fast carrier operations of TF 77. She left the company of the carrier force on 2 December, and screened by the destroyer , provided gunfire support for the Republic of Korea (ROK) Corps in the Kasong-Kosong area. After disembarking Admiral Denebrink on 3 December at Kangnung, the battleship resumed station on the Korean &quot;bombline&quot;, providing gunfire support for the American 1st Marine Division. &quot;Wisconsin&quot;″s shelling accounted for a tank, two gun emplacements, and a building. She continued her gunfire support task for the 1st Marine Division and 1st ROK Corps through 6 December, accounting for enemy bunkers, artillery positions, and troop concentrations. On one occasion during that time, the battleship received a request for call-fire support and provided three star-shells for the 1st ROK Corps, illuminating an enemy attack that was consequently repulsed with a considerable number of enemy casualties.

After being relieved on the gunline by the heavy cruiser on 6 December, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; briefly retired from gunfire-support duties. She resumed them in the Kasong-Kosong area on 11 December screened by the destroyer . The following day, 12 December, had the helicopter embarkation on &quot;Wisconsin&quot; of Rear Admiral H. R. Thurber, Commander Battleship Division 2 (BatDiv 2), as part of his inspection trip in the Far East.

&quot;Wisconsin&quot; continued her naval gunfire-support duties on the bombline, shelling enemy bunkers, command posts, artillery positions, and trench systems through 14 December. She departed the &quot;bombline&quot; on that day to render special gunfire support duties in the Kojo area shelling coastal targets in support of United Nations (UN) troops ashore. That same day, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; returned to the Kasong-Kosong area. On 15 December, she disembarked Admiral Thurber by helicopter. The next day, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; departed Korean waters, heading for Sasebo to rearm.

Returning to the combat zone on 17 December, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; embarked United States Senator Homer Ferguson of Michigan on 18 December. That day, the battleship supported the 11th ROK invasion with night illumination fire that enabled the ROK troops to repulse a North Korean assault with heavy enemy casualties. Departing the &quot;bombline&quot; on 19 December, the battleship transferred Ferguson by helicopter to the carrier .

On 20 December, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; participated in a coordinated air-surface bombardment of Wonsan to neutralize selected targets in its area. The ship shifted its bombardment station to the western end of Wonsan harbor, hitting boats and small craft in the inner swept channel with her 5-inch (127 mm) guns during the afternoon and helping forestall attempts to assault the friendly-held islands nearby. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; then made an antiboat sweep to the north, firing her 5-inch batteries on suspected boat concentrations. She then provided gunfire support to UN troops operating at the bombline until 22 December, when she rejoined the carrier task force.

On 28 December, Cardinal Francis Spellman, on a Korean tour over the Christmas holidays, helicoptered aboard the ship to celebrate Mass for Catholic crew members. He left as he came, off Pohang. On New Year&#x27;s Eve day, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; put into Yokosuka.

&quot;Wisconsin&quot; departed that port on 8 January 1952 and returned to Korean waters. She reached Pusan the following day and entertained the president of South Korea, Syngman Rhee, and his wife, on 10 January. The couple received full military honors as they came aboard, which Rhee reciprocated by awarding Vice Admiral Martin the ROK Order of the Military Merit.

&quot;Wisconsin&quot; returned to the bombline on 11 January, and over the ensuing days, delivered heavy gunfire support for the 1st Marine Division and the 1st ROK Corps. As before, her primary targets were command posts, shelters, bunkers, troop concentrations, and mortar positions. As before, she stood ready to deliver call-fire support as needed, shelling enemy troops in the open on 14 January at the request of the ROK 1st Corps.

Rearming once more at Sasebo, she shortly joined TF 77 off the coast of Korea and resumed support at the bombline on 23 January. Three days later, she shifted again to the Kojo region, to participate in a coordinated air and gun strike. That same day, the battleship returned to the bombline and shelled the command post and communications center for the 15th North Korean Division during call-fire missions for the 1st Marine Division.

Returning to Wonsan at the end of January, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; bombarded enemy guns at Hodo Pando before she was rearmed at Sasebo. The battleship rejoined TF 77 on 2 February, and the next day blasted railway buildings and marshaling yards at Hodo Pando and Kojo before rejoining TF 77. After replenishment at Yokosuka a few days later, she returned to the Kosong area and resumed gunfire support. During that time, she destroyed railway bridges and a small shipyard while conducting call-fire missions on enemy command posts, bunkers, and personnel shelters, making numerous cuts on enemy trench lines in the process.

On 26 February, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; arrived at Pusan, where Vice Admiral Shon, the ROK chief of naval operations, United States Ambassador J.J. Muccio and Rear Admiral Scott-Montcrief, Royal Navy, Commander, Task Group 95.12 (TG 95.12) visited the battleship. Departing that South Korean port the following day, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; reached Yokosuka on 2 March. A week later, she shifted to Sasebo to prepare to return to Korean waters.

&quot;Wisconsin&quot; arrived off Songjin, Korea, on 15 March and concentrated her gunfire on enemy railway transport. Early that morning, she destroyed a communist troop train trapped outside a destroyed tunnel. That afternoon, she received the first direct hit in her history, when one of four shells from a North Korean 155 mm gun battery struck the shield of a starboard 40 mm mount. Although little material damage resulted, three men were injured. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; subsequently destroyed that battery with a full 16-inch (406 mm) salvo before continuing her mission. After again supporting 1st Marine Division with her heavy rifles, the battleship returned to Japan on 19 March.

Relieved as flagship of the 7th Fleet on 1 April by sister ship &quot;Iowa&quot;, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; departed Yokosuka, bound for the United States. En route home, she touched briefly at Guam, where she took part in the successful test of the Navy&#x27;s largest floating dry dock on 4–5 April, the first ever to accommodate an &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleship. She continued her homeward-bound voyage via Pearl Harbor and arrived at Long Beach, California, on 19 April before continuing on for Norfolk.

===After the Korean War (1952–1981)===
On 9 June, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; resumed her role as a training ship, taking midshipmen to Greenock, Scotland; Brest, France; and Guantánamo Bay, before returning to Norfolk. She departed Hampton Roads on 25 August and participated in the NATO exercise Operation Mainbrace, which was held out of Greenock, Scotland. After her return to Norfolk, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; underwent an overhaul in the naval shipyard there. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; remained in the Atlantic fleet throughout 1952 and into 1953, training midshipmen and conducting exercises. After a month of routine maintenance &quot;Wisconsin&quot; departed Norfolk on 9 September 1953, bound for the Far East.

Sailing via the Panama Canal to Japan, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; relieved &quot;New Jersey&quot; as 7th Fleet flagship on 12 October. During the months that followed, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; visited the Japanese ports of Kobe, Sasebo, Yokosuka, Otaru, and Nagasaki. She spent Christmas at Hong Kong and was ultimately relieved of flagship duties on 1 April 1954 and returned to the United States soon thereafter, reaching Norfolk, via Long Beach and the Panama Canal, on 4 May.

Entering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 11 June, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; underwent a brief overhaul and commenced a midshipman training cruise on 12 July. After revisiting Greenock, Brest, and Guantánamo Bay, the ship returned to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for repairs. Shortly thereafter, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; participated in Atlantic Fleet exercises as flagship for the commander, Second Fleet. Departing Norfolk in January 1955, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; took part in Operation Springboard, during which she visited Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Then, upon returning to Norfolk, the battleship conducted another midshipman&#x27;s cruise that summer, visiting Edinburgh, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Guantánamo Bay before returning to the United States.

Upon completion of a major overhaul at the New York Naval Shipyard, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; headed south for refresher training in the Caribbean Sea, later taking part in another Springboard exercise. During that cruise, she again visited Port-au-Prince and added Tampico, Mexico, and Cartagena, Colombia, to her list of ports of call. She returned to Norfolk on the last day of March 1955 for local operations. On 18 October, while operating in the East River in New York Harbor, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; was accidentally grounded, but the ship was freed in about an hour without any serious damage.

In April and the beginning of May 1956, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; operated in the Virginia Capes area. On 6 May, in heavy fog, the battleship collided with the destroyer . &quot;Wisconsin&quot; suffered extensive bow damage, and &quot;Eaton&quot; was also badly damaged. The battleship was sent to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for repairs. A novel experiment sped her repairs and enabled the ship to carry out her scheduled midshipman training cruise that summer. A 120-ton, 68 foot (21 m) section of the bow of &quot;Wisconsin&quot;″s incomplete sister ship was transported by barge, in one section, from Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Corporation of Newport News, Virginia, across Hampton Roads to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. Repair personnel completed the operation that grafted on the new bow in 16 days. On 28 June 1956, the ship was ready for sea.

&quot;Wisconsin&quot; resumed her midshipman training on 9 July 1956. That autumn, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; participated in Atlantic Fleet exercises off the coast of the Carolinas, returning to port on 8 November 1956. Entering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard a week later, the battleship underwent major repairs that were not finished until 2 January 1957.

After local operations off the Virginia capes on 3–4 January 1957 and from 9–11 January, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; departed Norfolk on 16 January, reporting to the commander, Fleet Training Group, at Naval Station Guantánamo Bay. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; served as Admiral Henry C. Crommelin&#x27;s flagship during the ensuing shore bombardment practices and other exercises held off the isle of Culebra, Puerto Rico, from 2–4 February. Sailing for Norfolk upon completion of the training period, the battleship arrived on 7 February and resumed local operations off Norfolk. On 27 March, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; sailed for the Mediterranean Sea, reaching Gibraltar on 6 April, she pushed on that day to rendezvous with TF 60 in the Aegean Sea before reporting to Turkey for the NATO exercise Red Pivot.

Departing Xeros Bay on 14 April, she arrived at Naples four days later, and conducted exercises in the eastern Mediterranean. In the course of those operational training evolutions, she rescued a pilot and crewman who survived the crash of a plane from the aircraft carrier . &quot;Wisconsin&quot; reached Valencia, Spain, on 10 May, and three days later, entertained prominent civilian and military officials of the city.

Departing Valencia on 17 April, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; reached Norfolk on 27 May. En route, she was called upon to sink a Boeing KC-97F-55-BO Stratofreighter, 51-0258, which had ditched in the Atlantic on 9 May, 550 km (343.8 mi) southeast of the Azores Islands following a double engine failure, and subsequently floated for 10 days.

On 27 May, Rear Admiral Lewis S. Parks relieved Rear Admiral Crommelin as commander, BatDiv 2. Departing Norfolk on 19 June, the battleship, over the ensuing weeks, conducted a midshipman training cruise through the Panama Canal to South American waters, and reached Valparaiso on 3 July. Eight days later, the battleship headed back to the Panama Canal and the Atlantic.

After exercises at Guantánamo Bay and off Culebra, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; reached Norfolk on 5 August and conducted local operations that lasted into September. She then participated in NATO exercises, which took her across the North Atlantic to the British Isles.

&quot;Wisconsin&quot;″s days as an active fleet unit were numbered, and she prepared to make her last cruise. On 4 November, she departed Norfolk with a large group of prominent guests on board. Reaching New York City on 6 November, the battleship disembarked her guests, and on 8 November, headed for Bayonne, New Jersey, to commence a preinactivation overhaul. She was placed out of commission at Bayonne on 8 March 1958, and joined the United States Navy reserve fleet (better known as the &quot;mothball fleet&quot;) there, leaving the Navy without an active battleship for the first time since 1895. Subsequently, taken to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; remained there with her sister ship &quot;Iowa&quot; into the 1980s. While berthed in the Philadelphia Naval Yard, an electrical fire damaged the ship and left her as the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleship in the worst material condition prior to her 1980s reactivation.

===Reactivation (1986–1990)===
As part of President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Navy Secretary John F. Lehman&#x27;s effort to create a &quot;600-ship Navy,&quot; &quot;Wisconsin&quot; was reactivated 1 August 1986, a precommissioning unit (PCU) crew established, and the ship moved under tow to the Avondale Shipyard in New Orleans, Louisiana, to commence pre-recommissioning workups. The battleship was then towed from the Avondale Shipyard and arrived at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, on 2 January 1987 to receive weapons system upgrades for her modernization. During the modernization, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; had all of her remaining 20 mm Oerlikon and 40 mm Bofors antiaircraft guns removed, due to their ineffectiveness against modern jet fighters and enemy antiship missiles; additionally, the two gun mounts located at midship and in the aft on the port and starboard sides of the battleship were removed.

Over the next several months, the ship was upgraded with the most advanced weaponry available. Among the new weapon systems installed were four MK 141 quad cell launchers for 16 RGM-84 Harpoon antiship missiles, eight armored box launcher mounts for 32 BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles, and four of the United States Navy&#x27;s Phalanx close-in weapon system 20 mm Gatling guns for defense against enemy antiship missiles and enemy aircraft. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; also received eight RQ-2 Pioneer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), remotely controlled drones that replaced the helicopters previously used to spot for her nine guns. Also included in her modernization were upgrades to radar and fire control systems for her guns and missiles, and improved electronic warfare capabilities. Armed as such, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; was formally recommissioned on 22 October 1988 in Pascagoula, under the command of Captain Jerry M. Blesch, USN. Assigned to the United States Atlantic Fleet, she was subsequently homeported at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, where she became the centerpiece of her own surface action group (SAG), also referred to as a battleship battle group (BBBG).

&quot;Wisconsin&quot; spent the first part of 1989 conducting training exercises in the Atlantic Ocean and off the coast of Puerto Rico before returning to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a post-recommissioning shakedown that lasted the rest of the year. In mid-1990, the battleship participated in a fleet exercise.

===Gulf War (January/February 1991)===
On 2 August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. In the middle of the month, President George H. W. Bush, in keeping with the Carter Doctrine, sent the first of several hundred thousand troops, along with a strong force of naval support, to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf area to support a multinational force in a standoff with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. On 7 August, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; and her battle group were ordered to deploy in defense of Kuwait for Operation Desert Shield, and they arrived in the Persian Gulf on 23 August. On 15 January 1991, Operation Desert Storm commenced operations, and &quot;Wisconsin&quot; found herself serving alongside her sister &quot;Missouri&quot;, just as she had done in Korea 40 years previously. Both &quot;Wisconsin&quot; and &quot;Missouri&quot; launched Tomahawk missile attacks against Iraq; they were among the first ships to fire cruise missiles during the 1991 Gulf War. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; served as the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of Operation Desert Storm and firing a total of 24 of her own TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; also assumed the responsibility of the local antisurface warfare coordinator for the Northern Persian Gulf Surface Action Group.

&quot;Wisconsin&quot;, escorted by , relieved &quot;Missouri&quot; on 6 February, then answered her first combat call for gunfire support since March 1952. The recently recommissioned battleship sent 11 shells to destroy an Iraqi artillery battery in southern Kuwait during a mission called in by USMC OV-10 Bronco aircraft. Using an RQ-2 Pioneer UAV as a spotter in combat for the first time, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; pounded an Iraqi communications compound on 7 February. Her main guns lobbed 24 shells on Iraqi artillery sites, missile facilities, and electronic-warfare sites along the coast. That evening, she targeted naval sites with her guns, firing 50 rounds, which severely damaged or sank 15 Iraqi boats, and destroyed several piers at the Khawr al-Mufattah marina. In response to calls for fire support from US and coalition forces, &quot;Wisconsin&quot;″s main battery was used again on 9 February, blasting bunkers and artillery sites, and shelling Iraqi troop positions near Khafji after the Iraqis were ousted from the city by Saudi and Qatari armor. On 21 February, one of &quot;Wisconsin&quot;″s UAVs observed several trucks resupplying an Iraqi command post; in response, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; trained her guns on the complex, leveling or heavily damaging 10 of the buildings. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; and &quot;Missouri&quot; alternated positions on the gun line, using their guns to destroy enemy targets and soften defenses along the Kuwait coastline for a possible amphibious assault.

On the night of 23 February, &quot;Missouri&quot; and &quot;Wisconsin&quot; turned their big guns on Kuwait&#x27;s Faylaka Island to support the US-led coalition ground offensive to free Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation forces. The two ships were to conduct a diversionary assault aimed at convincing the Iraqi forces arrayed along the shores of Faylaka Island that coalition forces were preparing to launch an amphibious invasion. As part of this attack, &quot;Missouri&quot; and &quot;Wisconsin&quot; were directed to shell known Iraqi defensive positions on the island. Shortly after &quot;Missouri&quot; completed her shelling of Faylaka Island, &quot;Wisconsin&quot;, while still over the horizon (and thus out of visual range of the Iraqi forces) launched her RQ-2 Pioneer UAV to spot for her guns. As &quot;Wisconsin&quot;″s drone approached Faylaka Island, the pilot of the drone was instructed to fly the vehicle low over Iraqi positions so that the soldiers would know that they were once again being targeted by a battleship. Iraqi troops on the ground heard the Pioneer&#x27;s distinctive buzzing sound, and having witnessed the effects of &quot;Missouri&quot;″s artillery strike on their trench line, the Iraqi troops decided to signal their willingness to surrender by waving makeshift white flags, an action dutifully noted aboard &quot;Wisconsin&quot;. Amused at this sudden development, the men assigned to the drone&#x27;s aircrew called &quot;Wisconsin&quot;″s commanding officer, Captain David S. Bill III, and asked, &quot;Sir, they want to surrender, what should I do with them?&quot; This surrender to &quot;Wisconsin&quot;″s Pioneer has since become one of the most remembered moments of the Gulf War; the incident was also the first-ever surrender of enemy troops to an unmanned aircraft controlled by a ship. &quot;Wisconsin&quot;″s drone also carried out a number of reconnaissance missions on occupied Kuwait before the coalition&#x27;s ground offensive.

The next day, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; answered two separate call-fire support missions for coalition forces by suppressing Iraqi troops barricaded in two bunkers. After witnessing the effects of &quot;Wisconsin&quot;″s strike against the Iraqi positions, an elated Saudi marine commander commented over the radio, &quot;I wish we had a battleship in our navy.&quot;

Both &quot;Wisconsin&quot; and &quot;Missouri&quot; delivered more than 1 million pounds of ordnance on Iraqi targets by the time President George H. W. Bush ended hostilities on 28 February. With one last salvo from her big guns, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; fired the last naval gunfire-support mission of the war, and thus was the final battleship in world history to see action. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; remained in the Persian Gulf after the cease-fire took effect, and returned home on 28 March 1991. During the eight months &quot;Wisconsin&quot; spent in the Persian Gulf, she had flown 348 UAV hours, recorded 661 safe helicopter landings, steamed , fired 319 rounds, 881 rounds, and 5,200 20 mm Phalanx CIWS rounds, and launched 24 Tomahawk cruise missiles. Since all four remaining battleships were decommissioned and stricken following the Gulf War, this was the last time that United States battleships actively participated in a war.

===Museum ship (1992–present)===
With the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the absence of a perceived threat to the United States came drastic cuts in the defense budget. The high cost of maintaining and operating battleships as part of the United States Navy&#x27;s active fleet became uneconomical; as a result, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; was decommissioned on 30 September 1991 after 14 total years of active service, and joined the Reserve Fleet at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register (NVR) on 12 January 1995, then on 15 October 1996, she was moved to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, and on 12 February 1998, she was restored to the Naval Vessel Register. On 7 December 2000, the battleship was towed from Portsmouth, Virginia, and berthed adjacent to Nauticus, The National Maritime Center in Norfolk. On 16 April 2001 the battleship&#x27;s weather decks were opened to the public by the Hampton Roads Naval Museum, a U.S. Navy museum charged with &quot;Wisconsin&quot;″s interpretation and public visitation. The ship was still owned by the Navy and was considered part of the mothball fleet.

&quot;Wisconsin&quot; was named (along with &quot;Iowa&quot;) as one of two US Navy battleships to be maintained in the reserve fleet in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996 as shore-bombardment vessels. However, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; was then over 60 years old and would have required extensive modernization to return to the fleet since most of her technology dated back to World War II, and the missile and electronic-warfare equipment added to the battleship during her 1988–89 modernization were considered obsolete. In addition, the cost of modernizing the battleships was estimated to be around $500 million for reactivation and $1.5 billion for a full modernization program.

On 17 March 2006, the Secretary of the Navy struck &quot;Iowa&quot; and &quot;Wisconsin&quot; from the Naval Vessel Register, which cleared the way for both ships to be donated for use as museums. However, the U.S. Congress remained &quot;deeply concerned&quot; over the loss of naval surface-gunfire support that the battleships provided, and noted, &quot;...navy efforts to improve upon, much less replace, this capability have been highly problematic.&quot; Partially as a consequence, Congress passed , the National Defense Authorization Act 2006, requiring that the battleships be kept and maintained in a state of readiness should they ever be needed again. Congress had ordered that the following measures be implemented to ensure that &quot;Wisconsin&quot; could be returned to active duty if needed:
# She must not be altered in any way that would impair her military utility.
# The battleship must be preserved in her present condition through the continued use of cathodic protection, dehumidification systems, and any other preservation methods as needed.
# Spare parts and unique equipment, such as the gun barrels and projectiles, must be preserved in adequate numbers to support &quot;Wisconsin&quot;, if reactivated.
# The Navy must prepare plans for the rapid reactivation of &quot;Wisconsin&quot; should she be returned to the Navy in the event of a national emergency.
These conditions closely mirrored the original three conditions that the Nation Defense Authorization Act of 1996 laid out for the maintenance of &quot;Wisconsin&quot; while she was in the mothball fleet.

On 14 December 2009, the US Navy officially transferred &quot;Wisconsin&quot; to the city of Norfolk, ending the requirement for the ship to be preserved for possible recall to active duty. The US Navy had paid the city of Norfolk $2.8 million between 2000 and 2009 to maintain the ship. A formal ceremony transferring the ship to the city of Norfolk took place on 16 April 2010. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 28 March 2012.

Visitors have included the crew of the Royal Navy&#x27;s , who also volunteered to help clean and repaint &quot;Wisconsin&quot; while stationed in Norfolk during the WESTLANT 23 naval aviation trials in 2023.

==Awards==
&quot;Wisconsin&quot; earned five battle stars for her World War II service, and one for the Korean War. The ship also received the Combat Action Ribbon and Navy Unit Commendation for actions in the Korean War and Operation Desert Storm in 1991. She also received over a dozen more awards for World War II, the Korean War, and Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.

<doc id="206553" wikidata="Q846856" url="?curid=206553" title="Emanationism">
<text>Emanationism is a theory in the cosmology or cosmogony of certain religious and philosophical systems, that posits the concept of &quot;emanation&quot;. According to this theory, emanation, from the Latin &quot;emanare&quot; meaning &quot;to flow from&quot; or &quot;to pour forth or out of&quot;, is the mode by which all existing things are derived from a &#x27;first reality&#x27;, or first principle. In the emanationist concept all things are derived from this first reality or perfect God, by consecutive steps of degradation, to a lower degree of this first reality or God: at every consecutive step the emanating beings are less pure, less perfect, less divine. Emanationism posits a transcendent principle from which everything is derived, as opposed to creationism, that considers the universe to be created by a sentient God who is separate from creation, and to materialism, which posits no underlying subjective and/or ontological nature behind phenomena, all phenomena being considered immanent.

==Origins==
Emanationism is a cosmological theory which asserts that all things &quot;flow&quot; from an underlying principle or reality, usually called the Absolute or Godhead. Any teachings which involve emanation are usually in opposition to creation ex nihilo as emanation advocates that everything has always existed and has not been &quot;created&quot; from nothing.

 writes:

Underlying the worldview of traditional cosmology is the idea that the universe is an emanation of a unitary divine principle. Although this idea has been blended with the revealed creationist doctrines of the major monotheistic religions, orthodox theologians have generally regarded it with suspicion. They have relegated it to the shadowy spheres of mysticism, pantheism, and the occult, which have always been at odds with orthodoxy. The traditional view is summed in the doctrine of emanation formulated by Plotinus.

The primary classical exponent of emanationism was the neoplatonic philosopher Plotinus, who in his &quot;Enneads&quot; described all things phenomenal and otherwise as an emanation ( &quot;aporrhoe&quot; (Ennead ΙΙ.3.2) or ἀπόρροια &quot;aporrhoia&quot; (II.3.11)) from the One (ἕν, &quot;hen&quot;). In 5.1.6, emanationism is compared to a diffusion from the One, of which there are three primary hypostases, the One, the Intellect (νοῦς, &quot;nous&quot;), and the Soul (ψυχή, &quot;psyche&quot;).

Another advocate of emanationism was Michael Servetus, who was burned at the stake for his nontrinitarian cosmology.

==Occultism==
Emanationism is a common teaching found in occult and esoteric writings. According to :

Theosophy draws on Neoplatonic emanationism, in particular the concept of separation from and return to the Absolute, and reworks the Eastern concepts of karma and reincarnation to provide an evolutionary theory of both humankind and the universe.

Theosophy contends that all organisms—including animals and human beings—and all matter &quot;flow&quot; from a pure spiritual formation in the Absolute to a material one over time to become materialised and that they will later return to the Absolute after the cosmic cycle of life.

As Morgan summarises: &quot;&quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot; laid out an emanationist view of the development of the physical universe, a process of ebb and flow in which spirit gradually unfolded itself in matter, attaining consciousness, and returning to spirit in a higher and more realised form.&quot; According to the emanationist cosmology of Madame Blavatsky all monads emerge from divine unity at the beginning of a cosmic cycle and return to this source at its close.

Blavatsky in her book &quot;The Key to Theosophy&quot; (1889) wrote that: &quot;We believe in a universal divine principle, the root of all, from which all proceeds, and within which all shall be at the end of the great cycle of being.&quot;

Occultist Samael Aun Weor taught emanationism from his studies with the Kabbalah and Gnosticism. He mapped out a complex esoteric cosmology with matter flowing from different planes of existence all existing in the absolute. As comments:

As with esoteric thought in general, Weor holds that the universe originated in the ordering activity of the absolute upon chaotic primordial matter, giving rise to (emanating) the subsequent planes of the created order (Pleroma).

<text>The Helsinki Metropolitan Area Council (, ) was a co-operation agency operating in the Helsinki metropolitan area, now replaced by [[Helsinki Regional Transport Authority|HSL]] and [[Helsinki Region Environmental Services|HSY]]. The organisation had a few responsibilities, most notably regional public transport and waste management. It was subordinated to the city councils of the four participating cities (Helsinki, Vantaa, Espoo and Kauniainen). Furthermore, transport cooperation also included neighboring municipalities of Kerava and Kirkkonummi.

==Economy==
The Metropolitan Council used €155.6 million in 2002 and its income was €160.3 million. Traffic and waste management make up 97% of its expenditure. About 70% of the income consisted of customer fees for public transport and waste management.

==Transportation management==
The Metropolitan Council grouped together different Public Transportation companies operating in the Metropolitan area, such as HKL, operator of the metro, Suomenlinna ferry service and bus services within the Helsinki region, and published a timetable of all public transport quarterly, and provided a public transport route planner service on the Internet. It also ran ticketing and prices, fixing prices at the same level for all public transportation, irrespective of method or transportation company. These services are now (since January 1, 2010) provided by Helsingin seudun liikenne.
Most tickets were bought using the electronic travel cards, a smart card service run by Buscom. These travel cards supported two types of payment for trips:
If the same travel card was loaded with both value and period, period took priority when applicable to the current zone. If the period ran out, or the passenger travelled to a zone where the period was not applicable, value was used instead.

The travel cards were bought through certain shops and Public Transport Information Centres.

The Helsinki Metropolitan Area Council managed the following zones before 2010:

* Helsinki
* Espoo and Kauniainen
* Vantaa
* Regional traffic 1: Helsinki, Espoo, Kauniainen and Vantaa
* Regional traffic 2: Espoo, Kauniainen, Vantaa, Kerava and Kirkkonummi (excluding Helsinki)
* Entire region: Helsinki, Espoo, Kauniainen, Vantaa, Kerava and Kirkkonummi

==Mission==
The mission of the Metropolitan Council was to improve the capital area&#x27;s development by high quality public transports, waste management and air protection. In addition a &quot;development planning unit&quot; has the purpose to increase cooperation between the four town-administrations involved, particularly regarding planning of land use.

<doc id="206555" wikidata="Q49385" url="?curid=206555" title="Solar cycle">
<text>The Solar cycle, also known as the solar magnetic activity cycle, sunspot cycle, or Schwabe cycle, is a periodic 11-year change in the Sun&#x27;s activity measured in terms of variations in the number of observed sunspots on the Sun&#x27;s surface. Over the period of a solar cycle, levels of solar radiation and ejection of solar material, the number and size of sunspots, solar flares, and coronal loops all exhibit a synchronized fluctuation from a period of minimum activity to a period of a maximum activity back to a period of minimum activity.

The magnetic field of the Sun flips during each solar cycle, with the flip occurring when the solar cycle is near its maximum. After two solar cycles, the Sun&#x27;s magnetic field returns to its original state, completing what is known as a Hale cycle.

This cycle has been observed for centuries by changes in the Sun&#x27;s appearance and by terrestrial phenomena such as aurora but was not clearly identified until 1843. Solar activity, driven by both the solar cycle and transient aperiodic processes, governs the environment of interplanetary space by creating space weather and impacting space- and ground-based technologies as well as the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and also possibly climate fluctuations on scales of centuries and longer.

Understanding and predicting the solar cycle remains one of the grand challenges in astrophysics with major ramifications for space science and the understanding of magnetohydrodynamic phenomena elsewhere in the universe.

The current scientific consensus on climate change is that solar variations only play a marginal role in driving global climate change, since the measured magnitude of recent solar variation is much smaller than the forcing due to greenhouse gases.

== Definition ==
Solar cycles have an average duration of about 11 years. Solar maximum and solar minimum refer to periods of maximum and minimum sunspot counts. Cycles span from one minimum to the next.

== Observational history ==

The idea of a cyclical solar cycle was first hypothesized by Christian Horrebow based on his regular observations of sunspots made between 1761 and 1776 from the Rundetaarn observatory in Copenhagen, Denmark. In 1775, Horrebow noted how &quot;it appears that after the course of a certain number of years, the appearance of the Sun repeats itself with respect to the number and size of the spots&quot;. The solar cycle however would not be clearly identified until 1843 when Samuel Heinrich Schwabe noticed a periodic variation in the average number of sunspots after 17 years of solar observations. Schwabe continued to observe the sunspot cycle for another 23 years, until 1867. In 1852, Rudolf Wolf designated the first numbered solar cycle to have started in February 1755 based on Schwabe&#x27;s and other observations. Wolf also created a standard sunspot number index, the Wolf number, which continues to be used today.

Between 1645 and 1715, very few sunspots were observed and recorded. This was first noted by Gustav Spörer and was later named the Maunder minimum after the wife-and-husband team Annie S. D. Maunder and Edward Walter Maunder who extensively researched this peculiar interval.

In the second half of the nineteenth century Richard Carrington and Spörer independently noted the phenomena of sunspots appearing at different heliographic latitudes at different parts of the cycle. (See Spörer&#x27;s law.) Alfred Harrison Joy would later describe how the magnitude at which the sunspots are &quot;tilted&quot;—with the leading spot(s) closer to the equator than the trailing spot(s)―grows with the latitude of these regions. (See Joy&#x27;s law.)

The cycle&#x27;s physical basis was elucidated by George Ellery Hale and collaborators, who in 1908 showed that sunspots were strongly magnetized (the first detection of magnetic fields beyond the Earth). In 1919 they identified a number of patterns that would collectively become known as Hale&#x27;s law:
* In the same heliographic hemisphere, bipolar active regions tend to have the same leading polarity.
* In the opposite hemisphere (that is, on the other side of the solar equator) these regions tend to have the opposite leading polarity.
* Leading polarities in both hemispheres flip from one sunspot cycle to the next.
Hale&#x27;s observations revealed that the complete magnetic cycle—which would later be referred to as a Hale cycle—spans two solar cycles, or 22 years, before returning to its original state (including polarity). Because nearly all manifestations are insensitive to polarity, the 11-year solar cycle remains the focus of research; however, the two halves of the Hale cycle are typically not identical: the 11-year cycles usually alternate between higher and lower sums of Wolf&#x27;s sunspot numbers (the Gnevyshev-Ohl rule).

In 1961 the father-and-son team of Harold and Horace Babcock established that the solar cycle is a spatiotemporal magnetic process unfolding over the Sun as a whole. They observed that the solar surface is magnetized outside of sunspots, that this (weaker) magnetic field is to first order a dipole, and that this dipole undergoes polarity reversals with the same period as the sunspot cycle. Horace&#x27;s Babcock Model described the Sun&#x27;s oscillatory magnetic field as having a quasi-steady periodicity of 22 years. It covered the oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic field components.

== Cycle history ==

Sunspot numbers over the past 11,400 years have been reconstructed using carbon-14 and beryllium-10 isotope ratios. The level of solar activity beginning in the 1940s is exceptional – the last period of similar magnitude occurred around 9,000 years ago (during the warm Boreal period). The Sun was at a similarly high level of magnetic activity for only ~10% of the past 11,400 years. Almost all earlier high-activity periods were shorter than the present episode. Fossil records suggest that the solar cycle has been stable for at least the last 700 million years. For example, the cycle length during the Early Permian is estimated to be 10.62 years and similarly in the Neoproterozoic.

Until 2009, it was thought that 28 cycles had spanned the 309 years between 1699 and 2008, giving an average length of 11.04 years, but research then showed that the longest of these (1784–1799) may actually have been two cycles. If so then the average length would be only around 10.7 years. Since observations began cycles as short as 9 years and as long as 14 years have been observed, and if the cycle of 1784–1799 is double then one of the two component cycles had to be less than 8 years in length. Significant amplitude variations also occur.

Several lists of proposed historical &quot;grand minima&quot; of solar activity exist.

=== Recent cycles ===

==== Cycle 25 ====
Solar cycle 25 began in December 2019. Several predictions have been made for solar cycle 25 based on different methods, ranging from very weak to strong magnitude. A physics-based prediction relying on the data-driven solar dynamo and solar surface flux transport models seems to have predicted the strength of the solar polar field at the current minima correctly and forecasts a weak but not insignificant solar cycle 25 similar to or slightly stronger than cycle 24. Notably, they rule out the possibility of the Sun falling into a Maunder-minimum-like (inactive) state over the next decade. A preliminary consensus by a solar cycle 25 Prediction Panel was made in early 2019. The Panel, which was organized by NOAA&#x27;s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) and NASA, based on the published solar cycle 25 predictions, concluded that solar cycle 25 will be very similar to solar cycle 24. They anticipate that the solar cycle minimum before cycle 25 will be long and deep, just as the minimum that preceded cycle 24. They expect solar maximum to occur between 2023 and 2026 with a sunspot range of 95 to 130, given in terms of the revised sunspot number.

==== Cycle 24 ====

Solar cycle 24 began on 4 January 2008, with minimal activity until early 2010. The cycle featured a &quot;double-peaked&quot; solar maximum. The first peak reached 99 in 2011 and the second in early 2014 at 101. Cycle 24 ended in December 2019 after 11.0 years.

==== Cycle 23 ====

Solar cycle 23 lasted 11.6 years, beginning in May 1996 and ending in January 2008. The maximum smoothed sunspot number (monthly number of sunspots averaged over a twelve-month period) observed during the solar cycle was 120.8 (March 2000), and the minimum was 1.7. A total of 805 days had no sunspots during this cycle.

== Phenomena ==
 Because the solar cycle reflects magnetic activity, various magnetically driven solar phenomena follow the solar cycle, including sunspots, faculae/plage, network, and coronal mass ejections.

=== Sunspots ===
The Sun&#x27;s apparent surface, the photosphere, radiates more actively when there are more sunspots. Satellite monitoring of solar luminosity revealed a direct relationship between the solar cycle and luminosity with a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 0.1%. Luminosity decreases by as much as 0.3% on a 10-day timescale when large groups of sunspots rotate across the Earth&#x27;s view and increase by as much as 0.05% for up to 6 months due to faculae associated with large sunspot groups.

The best information today comes from SOHO (a cooperative project of the European Space Agency and NASA), such as the MDI magnetogram, where the solar &quot;surface&quot; magnetic field can be seen.

As each cycle begins, sunspots appear at mid-latitudes, and then move closer and closer to the equator until a solar minimum is reached. This pattern is best visualized in the form of the so-called butterfly diagram. Images of the Sun are divided into latitudinal strips, and the monthly-averaged fractional surface of sunspots is calculated. This is plotted vertically as a color-coded bar, and the process is repeated month after month to produce this time-series diagram.
[[File:Sun - btly - 2023.png|center|thumb|upright=2.5|This version of the sunspot butterfly diagram was constructed by the solar group at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The newest version can be found at solarcyclescience.com]
While magnetic field changes are concentrated at sunspots, the entire sun undergoes analogous changes, albeit of smaller magnitude.

=== Faculae and plage ===
Faculae are bright magnetic features on the photosphere. They extend into the chromosphere, where they are referred to as plage. The evolution of plage areas is typically tracked from solar observations in the Ca II K line (393.37 nm). The amount of facula and plage area varies in phase with the solar cycle, and they are more abundant than sunspots by approximately an order of magnitude. They exhibit a non linear relation to sunspots. Plage regions are also associated with strong magnetic fields in the solar surface.

=== Solar flares and coronal mass ejections ===
The solar magnetic field structures the corona, giving it its characteristic shape visible at times of solar eclipses. Complex coronal magnetic field structures evolve in response to fluid motions at the solar surface, and emergence of [[magnetic flux]] produced by [[solar dynamo|dynamo]] action in the solar interior. For reasons not yet understood in detail, sometimes these structures lose stability, leading to [[solar flare]]s and [[coronal mass ejection]]s (CME). Flares consist of an abrupt emission of energy (primarily at [[ultraviolet]] and [[X-ray]] wavelengths), which may or may not be accompanied by a coronal mass ejection, which consists of injection of energetic particles (primarily ionized hydrogen) into interplanetary space. Flares and CME are caused by sudden localized release of magnetic energy, which drives emission of ultraviolet and X-ray radiation as well as energetic particles. These eruptive phenomena can have a significant impact on Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere and space environment, and are the primary drivers of what is now called [[space weather]]. Consequently, the occurrence of both [[geomagnetic storm]]s and [[Solar energetic particles|solar energetic particle]] events shows a strong solar cycle variation, peaking close to sunspot maximum.

The occurrence frequency of coronal mass ejections and flares is strongly modulated by the cycle. Flares of any given size are some 50 times more frequent at solar maximum than at minimum. Large coronal mass ejections occur on average a few times a day at solar maximum, down to one every few days at solar minimum. The size of these events themselves does not depend sensitively on the phase of the solar cycle. A case in point are the three large X-class flares that occurred in December 2006, very near solar minimum; an X9.0 flare on Dec 5 stands as one of the brightest on record.

== Patterns ==
Along with the approximately 11-year sunspot cycle, a number of additional patterns and cycles have been hypothesized.

=== Waldmeier effect ===

The Waldmeier effect describes the observation that the maximum amplitudes of solar cycles are inversely proportional to the time between their solar minima and maxima. Therefore, cycles with larger maximum amplitudes tend to take less time to reach their maxima than cycles with smaller amplitudes. This effect was named after [[Max Waldmeier]] who first described it.

=== Gnevyshev–Ohl rule ===

The Gnevyshev–Ohl rule, in its original formulation, states that for the summary index of solar activity over the 11-year cycle, there is a close connection in pairs of even and subsequent odd cycles, while opposite pairs exhibit no such connection.

=== Gleissberg cycle ===

The Gleissberg cycle describes an amplitude modulation of solar cycles with a period of about 70–100 years, or seven or eight solar cycles. It was named after Wolfgang Gleißberg.

As pioneered by [[Ilya G. Usoskin]] and [[Sami Solanki]], associated centennial variations in magnetic fields in the [[Solar corona|corona]] and [[heliosphere]] have been detected using [[carbon-14]] and [[beryllium-10]] cosmogenic isotopes stored in terrestrial reservoirs such as [[ice sheet]]s and [[tree ring]]s and by using historic observations of [[geomagnetic storm]] activity, which bridge the time gap between the end of the usable cosmogenic isotope data and the start of modern satellite data.

These variations have been successfully reproduced using models that employ magnetic flux continuity equations and observed sunspot numbers to quantify the emergence of magnetic flux from the top of the solar atmosphere and into the [[heliosphere]], showing that sunspot observations, geomagnetic activity and cosmogenic isotopes offer a convergent understanding of solar activity variations.

=== Suess cycle ===

The Suess cycle, or de Vries cycle, is a cycle present in radiocarbon proxies of solar activity with a period of about 210 years.
It was named after [[Hans Eduard Suess]] and [[Hessel de Vries]]. Despite calculated radioisotope production rates being well correlated with the 400-year sunspot record, there is little evidence of the Suess cycle in the 400-year sunspot record by itself.

=== Other hypothesized cycles ===
Periodicity of solar activity with periods longer than the solar cycle of about 11 (22) years has been proposed, including:
* The Hallstatt cycle (named after a cool and wet [[Hallstatt culture|period in Europe when glaciers advanced]]) is hypothesized to extend for approximately 2,400 years.
* In studies of [[carbon-14]] ratios, cycles of 105, 131, 232, 385, 504, 805 and 2,241 years have been proposed, possibly matching cycles derived from other sources. Damon and Sonett proposed carbon 14-based medium- and short-term variations of periods 208 and 88 years; as well as suggesting a 2300-year radiocarbon period that modulates the 208-year period.
* [[Brückner-Egeson-Lockyer cycle]] (30 to 40 year cycles).
* A 2021 study investigates the changes of the Pleistocene climate over the last 800 kyr from European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) temperature ([[δD]]) and CO2-CH4 records by using the benefits of the full-resolution methodology for time-series decomposition singular spectrum analysis, with a special focus on millennial-scale Sun-related signals. The quantitative impact of the three Sun-related cycles (unnamed ~9.7-kyr; proposed &#x27;Heinrich-Bond&#x27; ~6.0-kyr; Hallstatt ~2.5-kyr), cumulatively explain ~4.0% (δD), 2.9% (CO2), and 6.6% (CH4) in variance. A cycle of ~3.6 kyr, which is little known in literature, results in a mean variance of 0.6% only, does not seem to be Sun-related, although a gravitational origin cannot be ruled out. These 800-kyr-long EPICA suborbital records, which include millennial-scale Sun-related signals, fill an important gap in the field of solar cycles demonstrating for the first time the minor role of solar activity in the regional budget of Earth&#x27;s climate system during the Mid-Late Pleistocene.

== Effects ==

=== Sun ===
==== Surface magnetism ====
[[Sunspot]]s eventually decay, releasing magnetic flux in the photosphere. This flux is dispersed and churned by turbulent convection and solar large-scale flows. These transport mechanisms lead to the accumulation of magnetized decay products at high solar latitudes, eventually reversing the polarity of the polar fields (notice how the blue and yellow fields reverse in the Hathaway/NASA/MSFC graph above).

The dipolar component of the solar magnetic field reverses polarity around the time of solar maximum and reaches peak strength at the solar minimum.

=== Space ===

==== Spacecraft ====
CMEs ([[coronal mass ejection]]s) produce a radiation flux of high-energy [[protons]], sometimes known as solar cosmic rays. These can cause radiation damage to electronics and [[solar cell]]s in [[satellites]]. Solar proton events also can cause [[single-event upset]] (SEU) events on electronics; at the same, the reduced flux of galactic cosmic radiation during solar maximum decreases the high-energy component of particle flux.

CME radiation is dangerous to [[astronaut]]s on a space mission who are outside the shielding produced by the [[Earth&#x27;s magnetic field]]. Future mission designs (&quot;e.g.&quot;, for a [[human mission to Mars|Mars Mission]]) therefore incorporate a radiation-shielded &quot;storm shelter&quot; for astronauts to retreat to during such an event.

Gleißberg developed a CME forecasting method that relies on consecutive cycles.

The increased irradiance during solar maximum expands the envelope of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, causing low-orbiting [[space debris]] to re-enter more quickly.

==== Galactic cosmic ray flux ====
The outward expansion of solar ejecta into interplanetary space provides overdensities of plasma that are efficient at scattering high-energy [[cosmic rays]] entering the solar system from elsewhere in the galaxy. The frequency of solar eruptive events is modulated by the cycle, changing the degree of cosmic ray scattering in the outer solar system accordingly. As a consequence, the cosmic ray flux in the inner Solar System is anticorrelated with the overall level of solar activity. This anticorrelation is clearly detected in cosmic ray flux measurements at the Earth&#x27;s surface.

Some high-energy cosmic rays entering Earth&#x27;s atmosphere collide hard enough with molecular atmospheric constituents that they occasionally cause nuclear [[Cosmic ray spallation|spallation reactions]]. Fission products include radionuclides such as [[Carbon-14|14C]] and [[Beryllium-10|10Be]] that settle on the Earth&#x27;s surface. Their concentration can be measured in tree trunks or ice cores, allowing a reconstruction of solar activity levels into the distant past. Such reconstructions indicate that the overall level of solar activity since the middle of the twentieth century stands amongst the highest of the past 10,000 years, and that epochs of suppressed activity, of varying durations have occurred repeatedly over that time span.

==== Solar irradiance ====
The total solar irradiance (TSI) is the amount of solar radiative energy incident on the Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere. TSI variations were undetectable until satellite observations began in late 1978. A series of [[radiometers]] were launched on [[satellites]] since the 1970s. TSI measurements varied from 1355 to 1375 W/m2 across more than ten satellites. One of the satellites, the [[ACRIMSAT]] was launched by the ACRIM group. The controversial 1989–1991 &quot;ACRIM gap&quot; between non-overlapping ACRIM satellites was interpolated by the ACRIM group into a composite showing +0.037%/decade rise. Another series based on the ACRIM data is produced by the PMOD group and shows a −0.008%/decade downward trend. This 0.045%/decade difference can impact climate models. However, reconstructed total solar irradiance with models favor the PMOD series, thus reconciling the ACRIM-gap issue.

Solar irradiance varies systematically over the cycle, both in total irradiance and in its relative components (UV vs visible and other frequencies). The [[solar luminosity]] is an estimated 0.07 percent brighter during the mid-cycle solar maximum than the terminal solar minimum. [[Photosphere|Photospheric]] magnetism appears to be the primary cause (96%) of 1996–2013 TSI variation. The ratio of ultraviolet to visible light varies.

TSI varies in phase with the solar magnetic activity cycle with an amplitude of about 0.1% around an average value of about 1361.5 W/m2 (the &quot;[[solar constant]]&quot;). Variations about the average of up to −0.3% are caused by large sunspot groups and of +0.05% by large faculae and the bright network on a 7-10-day timescale Satellite-era TSI variations show small but detectable trends.

TSI is higher at solar maximum, even though sunspots are darker (cooler) than the average photosphere. This is caused by magnetized structures other than sunspots during solar maxima, such as faculae and active elements of the &quot;bright&quot; network, that are brighter (hotter) than the average photosphere. They collectively overcompensate for the irradiance deficit associated with the cooler, but less numerous sunspots. The primary driver of TSI changes on solar rotational and solar cycle timescales is the varying photospheric coverage of these radiatively active solar magnetic structures.

Energy changes in UV irradiance involved in production and loss of [[ozone]] have atmospheric effects. The 30 [[hPa]] [[atmospheric pressure]] level changed height in phase with solar activity during solar cycles 20–23. UV irradiance increase caused higher ozone production, leading to stratospheric heating and to poleward displacements in the [[Stratosphere|stratospheric]] and [[Troposphere|tropospheric]] wind systems.
==== Short-wavelength radiation ====

With a temperature of 5870 K, the [[photosphere]] emits a proportion of radiation in the [[extreme ultraviolet]] (EUV) and above. However, hotter upper layers of the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere ([[chromosphere]] and [[solar corona|corona]]) emit more short-wavelength radiation. Since the upper atmosphere is not homogeneous and contains significant magnetic structure, the solar ultraviolet (UV), [[Extreme ultraviolet|EUV]] and X-ray flux varies markedly over the cycle.

The photo montage to the left illustrates this variation for soft [[X-ray]], as observed by the Japanese satellite [[Yohkoh]] from after August 30, 1991, at the peak of cycle 22, to September 6, 2001, at the peak of cycle 23. Similar cycle-related variations are observed in the flux of solar UV or EUV radiation, as observed, for example, by the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] or [[TRACE]] satellites.

Even though it only accounts for a minuscule fraction of total solar radiation, the impact of solar UV, EUV and X-ray radiation on the Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere is profound. Solar UV flux is a major driver of [[Stratosphere|stratospheric chemistry]], and increases in ionizing radiation significantly affect [[ionosphere]]-influenced temperature and [[electrical conductivity]].
==== Solar radio flux ====
Emission from the Sun at centimetric (radio) wavelength is due primarily to coronal plasma trapped in the magnetic fields overlying active regions. The F10.7 index is a measure of the solar radio flux per unit frequency at a wavelength of 10.7 cm, near the peak of the observed solar radio emission. F10.7 is often expressed in SFU or [[solar flux unit]]s (1 SFU = 10−22 W m−2 Hz−1). It represents a measure of diffuse, nonradiative coronal plasma heating. It is an excellent indicator of overall solar activity levels and correlates well with solar UV emissions.

Sunspot activity has a major effect on long distance [[radio communications]], particularly on the [[shortwave]] bands although medium wave and low [[VHF]] frequencies are also affected. High levels of sunspot activity lead to improved signal propagation on higher frequency bands, although they also increase the levels of solar noise and ionospheric disturbances. These effects are caused by impact of the increased level of solar radiation on the [[ionosphere]].

10.7 cm solar flux could interfere with point-to-point terrestrial communications.

==== Clouds ====
Speculations about the effects of cosmic-ray changes over the cycle potentially include:
* Changes in ionization affect the aerosol abundance that serves as the condensation nucleus for cloud formation. During solar minima more cosmic rays reach Earth, potentially creating ultra-small aerosol particles as precursors to [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. Clouds formed from greater amounts of condensation nuclei are brighter, longer lived and likely to produce less precipitation.
* A change in cosmic rays could affect certain types of clouds.
* It was proposed that, particularly at high [[latitude]]s, cosmic ray variation may impact terrestrial low altitude cloud cover (unlike a lack of correlation with high altitude clouds), partially influenced by the solar-driven interplanetary magnetic field (as well as passage through the galactic arms over longer timeframes), but this hypothesis was not confirmed.
Later papers showed that production of clouds via cosmic rays could not be explained by nucleation particles. Accelerator results failed to produce sufficient, and sufficiently large, particles to result in cloud formation; this includes observations after a major solar storm. Observations after [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] do not show any induced clouds.

=== Terrestrial ===

==== Organisms ====
The impact of the solar cycle on living organisms has been investigated (see [[chronobiology]]). Some researchers claim to have found connections with human health.

The amount of ultraviolet UVB light at 300 nm reaching the Earth&#x27;s surface varies by a few percent over the solar cycle due to variations in the protective [[ozone layer]]. In the stratosphere, [[ozone]] is [[Ozone-oxygen cycle|continuously regenerated]] by the [[Photodissociation|splitting]] of [[Oxygen|O2]] molecules by ultraviolet light. During a solar minimum, the decrease in ultraviolet light received from the Sun leads to a decrease in the concentration of ozone, allowing increased UVB to reach the Earth&#x27;s surface.

==== Radio communication ====

Skywave modes of radio communication operate by bending ([[refracting]]) radio waves ([[electromagnetic radiation]]) through the [[Ionosphere]]. During the &quot;peaks&quot; of the solar cycle, the ionosphere becomes increasingly ionized by solar photons and [[cosmic rays]]. This affects the [[Radio propagation|propagation]] of the radio wave in complex ways that can either facilitate or hinder communications. Forecasting of skywave modes is of considerable interest to commercial [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] and [[aircraft]] [[communications]], [[amateur radio operators]] and [[shortwave]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]]. These users occupy frequencies within the [[High Frequency]] or &#x27;HF&#x27; radio spectrum that are most affected by these solar and ionospheric variances. Changes in solar output affect the [[maximum usable frequency]], a limit on the highest [[frequency]] usable for communications.

==== Climate ====
Both long-term and short-term variations in solar activity are proposed to potentially affect global climate, but it has proven challenging to show any link between solar variation and climate.

Early research attempted to correlate weather with limited success, followed by attempts to correlate solar activity with global temperature. The cycle also impacts regional climate. Measurements from the SORCE&#x27;s Spectral Irradiance Monitor show that solar UV variability produces, for example, colder winters in the U.S. and northern Europe and warmer winters in Canada and southern Europe during solar minima.

Three proposed mechanisms mediate solar variations&#x27; climate impacts:
* Total solar irradiance (&quot;[[Radiative forcing]]&quot;).
* Ultraviolet irradiance. The UV component varies by more than the total, so if UV were for some (as yet unknown) reason having a disproportionate effect, this might affect climate.
* Solar wind-mediated galactic [[cosmic ray]] changes, which may affect cloud cover.

The solar cycle variation of 0.1% has small but detectable effects on the Earth&#x27;s climate. Camp and Tung suggest that solar irradiance correlates with a variation of 0.18 K ±0.08 K (0.32 °F ±0.14 °F) in measured average global temperature between solar maximum and minimum.

Other effects include one study which found a relationship with wheat prices, and another one that found a weak correlation with the flow of water in the [[Paraná River]]. Eleven-year cycles have been found in tree-ring thicknesses and layers at the bottom of a lake hundreds of millions of years ago.

The current [[scientific consensus on climate change]] is that solar variations only play a marginal role in driving [[global climate change]], since the measured magnitude of recent solar variation is much smaller than the forcing due to greenhouse gases. Also, average solar activity in the 2010s was no higher than in the 1950s (see above), whereas average global temperatures had risen markedly over that period. Otherwise, the level of understanding of solar impacts on weather is low.

Solar variations also affect the [[orbital decay]] of objects in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) by altering the density of the upper [[thermosphere]].

== Solar dynamo ==
The 11-year solar cycle is thought to be one-half of a 22-year [[Babcock Model|Babcock–Leighton solar dynamo cycle]], which corresponds to an oscillatory exchange of energy between [[toroidal and poloidal]] solar magnetic fields which is mediated by solar plasma flows which also provides energy to the dynamo system at every step. At [[Solar maximum|solar-cycle maximum]], the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength, but an internal [[Toroidal and poloidal|toroidal]] quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the [[tachocline]], is near its maximum strength. At this point in the dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the [[Convection zone]] forces emergence of the toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon described by [[Hale&#x27;s law]].

During the solar cycle&#x27;s declining phase, energy shifts from the internal toroidal magnetic field to the external poloidal field, and sunspots diminish in number. At solar minimum, the toroidal field is, correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare and the poloidal field is at maximum strength. During the next cycle, differential rotation converts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field, with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle. The process carries on continuously, and in an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change in the polarity of the Sun&#x27;s large-scale magnetic field.

Solar dynamo models indicate that plasma flux transport processes in the solar interior such as differential rotation, meridional circulation and turbulent pumping play an important role in the recycling of the toroidal and poloidal components of the solar magnetic field. The relative strengths of these flux transport processes also determine the &quot;memory&quot; of the solar cycle that plays an important role in physics-based predictions of the solar cycle. In particular, stochastically forced non-linear solar dynamo simulations establish that the solar cycle memory is short, lasting over one cycle, thus implying accurate predictions are possible only for the next solar cycle and not beyond. This postulate of a short one cycle memory in the solar dynamo mechanism was later observationally verified.

Although the [[tachocline]] has long been thought to be the key to generating the Sun&#x27;s large-scale magnetic field, recent research has questioned this assumption. Radio observations of [[brown dwarfs]] have indicated that they also maintain large-scale magnetic fields and may display cycles of magnetic activity. The Sun has a radiative core surrounded by a convective envelope, and at the boundary of these two is the [[tachocline]]. However, brown dwarfs lack radiative cores and tachoclines. Their structure consists of a solar-like convective envelope that exists from core to surface. Since they lack a [[tachocline]] yet still display solar-like magnetic activity, it has been suggested that solar magnetic activity is only generated in the convective envelope.

== Speculated influence of the planets ==
A 2012 paper proposed that the torque exerted by the planets on a non-spherical [[tachocline]] layer deep in the Sun may synchronize the solar dynamo. Their results were shown to be an artifact of the incorrectly applied smoothing method leading to [[aliasing]]. Additional models incorporating the influence of planetary forces on the Sun have since been proposed. However, the solar variability is known to be essentially stochastic and unpredictable beyond one solar cycle, which contradicts the idea of the deterministic planetary influence on solar dynamo. Modern dynamo models are able to reproduce the solar cycle without any planetary influence.

In 1974 the book &quot;[[The Jupiter Effect]]&quot; suggested that the alignment of the planets would alter the Sun&#x27;s solar wind and, in turn, Earth&#x27;s weather, culminating in multiple catastrophes on March 10, 1982. None of the catastrophes occurred. In 2023, a paper by Cionco et al. demonstrated the improbability that the suspected tidal effect on the Sun driven by Venus and Jupiter were significant on whole solar tidal generating potential.

<doc id="206556" wikidata="Q3276562" url="?curid=206556" title="USS Wyoming (BB-32)">
<text>USS &quot;Wyoming&quot; (BB-32) was the lead ship of her class of dreadnought battleships and was the third ship of the United States Navy named Wyoming, although she was only the second named in honor of the 44th state. &quot;Wyoming&quot; was laid down at the William Cramp &amp; Sons in Philadelphia in February 1910, was launched in May 1911, and was completed in September 1912. She was armed with a main battery of twelve guns and capable of a top speed of .

During the First World War, she was part of the Battleship Division Nine, which was attached to the British Grand Fleet as the 6th Battle Squadron. During the war, she was primarily tasked with patrolling in the North Sea and escorting convoys to Norway. She served in both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets throughout the 1920s, and in 1931–1932, she was converted into a training ship according to the terms of the London Naval Treaty of 1930.

&quot;Wyoming&quot; served as a training ship throughout the 1930s, and in November 1941, she became a gunnery ship. She operated primarily in the Chesapeake Bay area, which earned her the nickname &quot;Chesapeake Raider&quot;. In this capacity, she trained some 35,000 gunners for the hugely expanded US Navy during World War II. She continued in this duty until 1947, when she was decommissioned on 1 August and subsequently sold for scrap; she was broken up in New York starting in December 1947.

==Design==
&quot;Wyoming&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by four-shaft Parsons steam turbines and twelve coal-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers rated at , generating a top speed of . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of .

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 12-inch/50 caliber Mark 7 guns in six Mark 9 twin gun turrets on the centerline, two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward. The other four turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in two superfiring pairs. The secondary battery consisted of twenty-one /51 caliber guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull. The main armored belt was thick, while the gun turrets had thick faces. The conning tower had thick sides.

=== Modifications ===
In 1925, &quot;Wyoming&quot; was modernized in the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Her displacement increased significantly, to standard and full load. Her beam was widened to , primarily from the installation of anti-torpedo bulges, and draft increased to . Her twelve coal-fired boilers were replaced with four White-Forster oil-fired boilers that had been intended for the ships cancelled under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty; performance remained the same as the older boilers. The ship&#x27;s deck armor was strengthened by the addition of of armor to the second deck between the end barbettes, plus of armor on the third deck on the bow and stern. The deck armor over the engines and boilers was increased by and , respectively. Five of the 5-inch guns were removed and eight /50 caliber anti-aircraft guns were installed. The mainmast was removed to provide space for an aircraft catapult mounted on the Number 3 turret amidships.

== Service history ==
&quot;Wyoming&quot; was laid down at the William Cramp &amp; Sons shipyard in Philadelphia on 9 February 1910, and was launched on 25 May 1911. She was completed a year and four months later, on 25 September 1912. After her commissioning, the final fitting-out work was completed at the New York Navy Yard over the next three months. She then proceeded to join the rest of the fleet at Hampton Roads on 30 December, where she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Charles J. Badger, the commander of the Atlantic Fleet. &quot;Wyoming&quot; left Hampton Roads on 6 January 1913, bound for the Caribbean. She visited the Panama Canal, which was nearing completion, and then participated in fleet exercises off Cuba. The ship was back in port in Chesapeake Bay on 4 March.

&quot;Wyoming&quot; then took part in gunnery drills off the Virginia Capes, and on 18 April, entered drydock at the New York Navy Yard for some repairs, which lasted until 7 May. She joined the rest of the fleet for maneuvers off Block Island that lasted from 7–24 May. During the maneuvers, the ship&#x27;s machinery proved troublesome, which necessitated repairs at Newport from 9–19 May. At the end of the month, she was in New York harbor, to participate in the ceremonies for the dedication of the monument to the armored cruiser , which had been destroyed in Havana harbor on 15 February 1898. On 4 June, &quot;Wyoming&quot; steamed to Annapolis, where she took on a crew of naval cadets from the Naval Academy for a summer midshipman cruise.

After returning the midshipmen to Annapolis on 24–25 August, &quot;Wyoming&quot; took part in gunnery and torpedo training over the next few weeks. On 16 September, she returned to New York for repairs, which lasted until 2 October. She then ran full–power sea trials before proceeding to the Virginia Capes, where she participated in another round of fleet maneuvers. Next, she departed for a European goodwill cruise on 26 October. She toured the Mediterranean Sea, stopping in Valletta, Malta, Naples, Italy, and Villefranche, France. She departed France on 30 November, and arrived in New York on 15 December. There, she went into dock at the New York Navy Yard for periodic repairs, which lasted until January 1914. On the 6th, &quot;Wyoming&quot; left for Hampton Roads, where she took on coal in preparation for the annual fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean.

The exercises lasted from 26 January to 15 March, and the fleet was based in Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. &quot;Wyoming&quot; and the rest of the fleet then proceeded to Tangier Sound for additional training, including gunnery drills. On 3 April, &quot;Wyoming&quot; left the fleet for an overhaul in New York, which lasted until 9 May. She then returned to Hampton Roads, where she took on a contingent of troops and ferried them to Veracruz, arriving on 18 May. The US had intervened in the Mexican Revolution and occupied Veracruz to safeguard American citizens there. &quot;Wyoming&quot; cruised off Veracruz into the Autumn of 1914, at which point she returned to the Virginia Capes for exercises. On 6 October, she entered New York for repairs; this work lasted until 17 January 1915.

&quot;Wyoming&quot; then proceeded to Hampton Roads, and then to Cuba, where she joined the fleet for the annual maneuvers off Cuba. These lasted until April, when she returned to the US. She participated in more exercises off Block Island over the next several months, and on 20 December, she returned to New York for another overhaul. On 6 January 1916, she emerged from dry dock, and then proceeded to the Caribbean. On 16 January, she reached Culebra, Puerto Rico, then visited Port-au-Prince, Haiti on 27 January. She entered port at Guantanamo the next day, and took part in fleet maneuvers until 10 April, after which she returned to New York. Another round of dockyard work took place from 16 April to 26 June. After returning to service, &quot;Wyoming&quot; took part in more maneuvers off the Virginia Capes for the remainder of the year. She left New York on 9 January 1917, bound for Cuban waters for exercises that lasted through mid-March. She left Cuba on 27 March, and was cruising off Yorktown, Virginia, when the US declared war on Germany on 6 April, formally entering World War I.

=== World War I ===
&quot;Wyoming&quot; operated out of the Chesapeake Bay area for the next seven months, training engine-room personnel for the expanding American fleet. On 25 November, Battleship Division 9 (BatDiv 9), which at that time comprised &quot;Wyoming&quot;, , , and , departed the US, bound for Britain. BatDiv 9 was to reinforce the British Grand Fleet at its base in Scapa Flow. The American ships reached Scapa on 7 December, where they became the 6th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet. The American ships drilled with their British counterparts from December 1917 to February 1918.

On 6 February, &quot;Wyoming&quot; and the other American battleships undertook their first wartime operation, to escort a convoy to Stavanger, Norway, in company with eight British destroyers. On 7 February, lookouts on several ships, including &quot;Wyoming&quot;, thought they spotted German U-boats attacking the ships with torpedoes, though these proved to be incorrect reports. The convoy successfully reached Norway two days later; the return trip to Scapa Flow took another two days. &quot;Wyoming&quot; patrolled in the North Sea for the next several months, watching for a sortie by the German High Seas Fleet. On 30 June, &quot;Wyoming&quot; and the rest of the 6th Battle Squadron covered a minelaying operation in the North Sea; the operation lasted until 2 July. During the operation, jumpy crewmen again incorrectly reported U-boat sightings, and &quot;Wyoming&quot; opened fire on the supposed targets. On the return voyage, the 6th Battle Squadron joined up with Convoy HZ40, which was returning from Norway.

On 14 October, &quot;New York&quot; collided with a U-boat and sank it. The collision nevertheless damaged her screws, which forced Rodman to transfer his flag from &quot;New York&quot; to &quot;Wyoming&quot; while the former was in dock for repair. On 21 November, after the Armistice with Germany ended the war, &quot;Wyoming&quot; and an Allied fleet of some 370 warships met the High Seas Fleet in the North Sea and escorted it into internment in Scapa Flow. On 12 December, &quot;Wyoming&quot;, now the flagship of Rear Admiral William Sims, the new BatDiv 9 commander, left Britain for France. There, she rendezvoused off Brest, France, with , which was carrying President Woodrow Wilson to the peace negotiations in Paris. &quot;Wyoming&quot; then returned to Britain two days later before departing for the US, arriving in New York on 25 December. She remained there through the new year, and on 18 January 1919, she became the flagship of BatDiv 7, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Robert Coontz.

=== Inter-war period ===
====1919–1924====
On 1 February, &quot;Wyoming&quot; steamed out of New York to join the annual fleet maneuvers off Cuba, before returning to New York on 14 April. On 12 May, she left port to help guide a group of Navy Curtiss NC flying boats as they made the first aerial transatlantic crossing. The battleship was back in port by 31 May. She then took on a crew of midshipmen for a training cruise off the Chesapeake Bay and Virginia Capes. After finishing the cruise, &quot;Wyoming&quot; entered dry dock at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 1 July for a modernization for service in the Pacific. Her secondary battery was reduced to sixteen 5-inch guns. After emerging from the shipyard, she became the flagship of BatDiv 6 of the newly designated Pacific Fleet. On 19 July, &quot;Wyoming&quot; and the rest of the Pacific Fleet departed the east coast, bound for the Pacific. The ships transited the Panama Canal later that month, and reached San Diego, California on 6 August.

On 9 August, &quot;Wyoming&quot; moved to San Pedro, where she was based for the next month. She went to the Puget Sound Navy Yard for an overhaul that lasted until 19 April 1920. On 4 May, she was back in San Pedro and resumed her normal routine of fleet maneuvers off the California coast. On 30 August, &quot;Wyoming&quot; left California for Hawaii, where she participated in more training exercises through September. She then returned to San Diego on 8 October for more maneuvers off the west coast. The ship left San Francisco on 5 January 1921 for a cruise to Central and South American waters; the trip culminated in Valparaíso, Chile, where she was reviewed by the President of Chile Arturo Alessandri Palma on 8 February. &quot;Wyoming&quot; then returned north, arriving in Puget Sound for repairs on 18 March.

On 2 August, &quot;Wyoming&quot; was in Balboa in the Canal Zone, where she picked up Rear Admiral Rodman and a commission traveling from Peru back to New York. She arrived in New York on 19 August and rejoined the Atlantic Fleet. There, she became the flagship of Admiral Hilary P. Jones, the commander of the Atlantic Fleet. &quot;Wyoming&quot; spent the next three and a half years on the normal routine of winter fleet exercises off Cuba, followed by summer maneuvers off the east coast of the US. Throughout the period, she served as the flagship of Vice Admirals John McDonald, Newton McCully, and Josiah McKean in the Scouting Fleet. In the summer of 1924, she conducted a midshipman training cruise to Europe, and stopped in Torbay, Great Britain, Rotterdam in the Netherlands, Gibraltar, and the Azores. In January and February 1924, the Navy conducted Fleet Problem II, III, and IV concurrently. During the FP III maneuvers, &quot;Wyoming&quot;, her sister , and the two s stood in for the new s. During the FP IV portion of the maneuvers, &quot;Wyoming&quot; served in the &quot;Blue&quot; force, which represented the US Navy. She was attacked by &quot;Black&quot; aircraft, but the umpires judged &quot;Wyoming&quot;″s anti-aircraft fire and the escort fighters provided by to have effectively defended the fleet.

====1925–1930====
On 14 February 1925, &quot;Wyoming&quot; again passed through the Panama Canal to return to the Pacific. There, she joined fleet exercises off California. She then proceeded to Hawaii, where she remained from late April to early June. She visited San Diego on 18–22 June, and then returned to the east coast via the Panama Canal, arriving in New York on 17 July. A cruise to Cuba and Haiti followed, after which &quot;Wyoming&quot; returned to the New York Navy Yard for an overhaul that lasted from 23 November to 26 January 1926. During this period, then-Commander William F. Halsey, Jr. came aboard as the ship&#x27;s executive officer; he served on &quot;Wyoming&quot; until 4 January 1927.

&quot;Wyoming&quot; then returned to the routine of winter maneuvers in the Caribbean and training cruises in the summer. In late August, the ship went to Philadelphia for an extensive modernization. Her old coal-fired boilers were replaced with new oil-fired models and anti-torpedo bulges were added to improve her resistance to underwater damage. The work was completed by 2 November, after which &quot;Wyoming&quot; conducted a shakedown cruise to Cuba and the Virgin Islands. She was back in Philadelphia on 7 December, and two days later, she returned to her post as the flagship of the Scouting Fleet, flying the flag of Vice Admiral Ashley Robertson.

&quot;Wyoming&quot; spent the next three years in the Scouting Fleet. She conducted training cruises with Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) cadets from various universities, including Yale, Harvard, Georgia Tech, and Northwestern. These cruises went throughout the Atlantic, including to the Gulf of Mexico, to the Azores, and to Nova Scotia. While on one of these cruises in November 1928, &quot;Wyoming&quot; picked up eight survivors from the wrecked steamship ; she took them to Norfolk on 16 November. On 19 September 1930, &quot;Wyoming&quot; was transferred from the Scouting Force to BatDiv 2, where she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Wat Tyler Cluverius Jr. She served here until 4 November, when she was withdrawn from front-line service and became the flagship of the Training Squadron, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Harley H. Christy. Thereafter, she conducted a training cruise to the Gulf of Mexico.

====1931–1941====
After returning to Philadelphia on 1 January 1931, &quot;Wyoming&quot; was placed on reduced commission. Under the terms of the London Naval Treaty signed the previous year, &quot;Wyoming&quot; was to be demilitarized. During the demilitarization process, her anti-torpedo bulges, side armor, and half of her main battery guns were removed. She was back in service by May, and on the 29th, she took on a crew of midshipmen from Annapolis for a training cruise to Europe, which began on 5 June. While en route on 15 June, &quot;Wyoming&quot; rescued the disabled submarine and took it under tow to Queenstown, Northern Ireland. While in Europe, she stopped in Copenhagen, Denmark, Greenock, Scotland, Cadiz, Spain, and Gibraltar. The ship was back in Hampton Roads on 13 August; while on the cruise, &quot;Wyoming&quot; was reclassified as &quot;AG-17&quot;, to reflect her new role as a training ship.

&quot;Wyoming&quot; spent the next four years conducting training cruises for midshipmen and NROTC cadets to various destinations, including European ports, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico. On 18 January 1935, she carried the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment, from Norfolk to Puerto Rico for amphibious assault exercises. On 5 January 1937, the ship left Norfolk and steamed to the Pacific via the Panama Canal. She took part in more amphibious assault exercises and gunnery drills at San Clemente Island. On 18 February, during the exercises, a 5-inch shrapnel shell exploded as it was being loaded into one of her guns. The blast killed six Marines and wounded another eleven. &quot;Wyoming&quot; immediately steamed to San Pedro and transferred the wounded Marines to the hospital ship .

On 3 March, &quot;Wyoming&quot; left Los Angeles, bound for the Atlantic. She reached Norfolk on 23 March, where she served as the temporary flagship for Rear Admiral Wilson Brown, the commander of the Training Squadron, from 15 April to 3 June. On 4 June, she left port to conduct a goodwill cruise to Kiel, Germany, arriving on 21 June. There, she visited &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;. She left Germany on 29 June, stopping in Torbay, Britain, and Funchal, Madeira, and arrived in Norfolk on 3 August. &quot;Wyoming&quot; resumed her training ship duties for Naval and Merchant Marine Reserve units. She returned to Norfolk Navy Yard for an overhaul that lasted from 16 October to 14 January 1938.

&quot;Wyoming&quot; performed her typical routine of training cruises in the Atlantic through 1941. The cruises included another European trip in 1938; she took the midshipmen to Le Havre, France, Copenhagen, and Portsmouth. After the outbreak of World War II in Europe in September 1939, &quot;Wyoming&quot; was assigned to a naval reserve force in the Atlantic, alongside the battleships &quot;New York&quot;, &quot;Arkansas&quot;, and and the aircraft carrier . &quot;Wyoming&quot; became the flagship of Rear Admiral Randall Jacobs, the commander of the Training, Patrol Force on 2 January 1941. In November, &quot;Wyoming&quot; became a gunnery training ship. Her first cruise in this new role began on 25 November; she was cruising off Platt&#x27;s Bank in the Gulf of Maine when she received word of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December.

=== World War II ===

Following the United States&#x27; entrance into World War II, &quot;Wyoming&quot; performed her normal duties as a gunnery training ship with the Operational Training Command, United States Atlantic Fleet starting in February 1942. She operated primarily in the Chesapeake Bay area, and frequent sightings of the ship steaming around the bay earned her the nickname &quot;Chesapeake Raider&quot;. &quot;Wyoming&quot; was very busy, training thousands of anti-aircraft gunners on weapons ranging from light .50 caliber (12.7 mm) guns to medium-caliber 5-inch guns for the rapidly expanding American fleet. Early in the war, the Navy briefly considered converting &quot;Wyoming&quot; back to her battleship configuration, but decided against the plan.

These duties continued throughout the rest of the war. &quot;Wyoming&quot; was modernized at Norfolk Navy Yard from 12 January to 3 April 1944; the reconstruction removed the last of her three 12-inch gun turrets, and replaced them with four twin and two single enclosed mounts for 5-inch/38 caliber guns. New fire control radars were also installed; these modifications allowed &quot;Wyoming&quot; to train anti-aircraft gunners with the most modern equipment they would use while in combat with the fleet. She was back in service in the Chesapeake Bay by 10 April. Over the course of the war, &quot;Wyoming&quot; trained an estimated 35,000 gunners on seven different types of guns: 5-inch, 3-inch, 1.1-inch, 40-millimeter, 20-millimeter, .50 caliber, and .30 caliber (7.62 mm) weapons. Due to her extensive use as a gunnery training ship, she claimed the distinction of firing more ammunition than any other ship in the fleet during the war.

&quot;Wyoming&quot; finished her gunnery training duties in the Chesapeake area on 30 June 1945, when she left Norfolk for the New York Navy Yard, for further modifications. Work was completed by 13 July, after which she left for Casco Bay. There, she joined Composite Task Force 69 (CTF 69), under command of Vice Admiral Willis A. Lee. &quot;Wyoming&quot; was tasked with developing tactics to more effectively engage the Japanese kamikaze suicide aircraft. The gunners conducted experimental gunnery drills with towed sleeves, drone aircraft, and radio-controlled targets. On 31 August, CTF 69 was renamed Operational Development Force, United States Fleet.

&quot;Wyoming&quot; continued in this unit through the end of the war, and began to be used to test new fire control equipment. In the summer of 1946, then-Ensign Jimmy Carter, the future President of the United States, came aboard as part of the final crew of the old battleship. On 11 July 1947, &quot;Wyoming&quot; put into Norfolk and was decommissioned there on 1 August. Her crew was transferred to the ex-battleship , which was also serving in the gunnery training unit. &quot;Wyoming&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Registry on 16 September, and she was sold for scrapping on 30 October. She arrived on 5 December in New York, where she was dismantled by Lipsett, Incorporated.

<doc id="206567" wikidata="Q325872" url="?curid=206567" title="Maria (given name)">
<text>Maria is a feminine given name. It is given in many languages influenced by Christianity.

It was used as the feminine form of the unrelated Roman name &quot;Marius&quot; (see Maria gens), and, after Christianity had spread across the Roman empire, it became the Latinised form of the name of Miriam: Mary, mother of Jesus.

&quot;Maria&quot; (Greek: Μαρία) is a form of the name used in the New Testament, standing alongside &quot;Mariam&quot; (Μαριάμ). It reflects the Syro-Aramaic name &quot;Maryam&quot;, which is in turn derived from the Biblical Hebrew name &quot;Miriam&quot;. As a result of their similarity and syncretism, the Latin original name &quot;Maria&quot; and the Hebrew-derived &quot;Maria&quot; combined to form a single name.

In Germanic languages, the name&#x27;s usage is connected with the Germanic element *mar meaning &quot;famous&quot;.

The name is also sometimes used as a male (middle) name. This was historically the case in many Central Europe countries and still is the case in countries with strong Catholic traditions, where it signified patronage of the Virgin Mary (French-speakers often did the same with &quot;Marie&quot;).

In the Arabic language the name Mariam (مريم) (also written: Meryem, Mariya) means either &quot;white beautiful woman&quot; or &quot;white cow&quot; or &quot;a little bird with the same size as a pigeon&quot;, and it is quite popular in North Africa. One of the feminine Sahaba had the name Maria, Maria the Coptic.

==Variants and usage==
&quot;Maria&quot; was a frequently given name in southern Europe even in the medieval period. In addition to the simple name, there arose a tradition of naming girls after specific titles of Mary, feast days associated with Mary and specific Marian apparitions (such as &quot;María de los Dolores&quot;, &quot;María del Pilar&quot;, &quot;María del Carmen&quot; etc., whence the derived given names of &quot;Dolores&quot;, &quot;Pilar&quot;, &quot;Carmen&quot; etc.). By contrast, in northern Europe the name only rose to popularity after the Reformation.

Because the name is so frequent in Christian tradition, a tradition of giving compound names has developed, with a number of such compounds themselves becoming very popular. Examples, among numerous others, include:
*Anna + Maria (Anne-Marie, Marianne)
*Maria + Luisa (Marie-Louise)
*Maria + Antonia (Maria Antonia, French Marie-Antoinette)
*Maria + Helena (Italian Maria Elena, Spanish María Elena)
*Maria + Teresa (Maria Theresa, French Marie Thérèse)
*Maria + {Issa} Marissa or Marisa Christian Nazareth
*Maria + {Saiyra} Mary-Saiyra or Saiyra Mary Christian Antioch

As a feminine given name, &quot;Maria&quot; ranked 109th in the United States as of 2015, down from rank 31 held during 1973–1975. The English form &quot;Mary&quot; was at rank 214 as of 2015, after a much steeper decline down from being raked first consistently during 1880–1968.

Spelling variants of &quot;Maria&quot; include: &quot;Mária&quot; (Hungarian, Slovakian), &quot;María&quot; (Greek, Icelandic, Spanish), &quot;Máire&quot; and &quot;Muire&quot; (Irish), &quot;Marya&quot; (transliterated from Cyrillic), &quot;Marija&quot; (Latvian, but also used in other Balto-Slavic languages) and &quot;Maria&quot; (Polish). Due to a very strong devotion of Irish and Polish Catholics to the Blessed Virgin Mary, a special exception is made for two other forms of her name – &quot;Muire&quot; and &quot;Maryja&quot;: no one else may take that name, similar to the way the name &quot;Jesus&quot; is not used in most languages. The English form &quot;Mary&quot; is derived via French &quot;Marie&quot;.

A great number of hypocoristic forms are in use in numerous languages. Cyrillic &quot;Maryam&quot; and &quot;Miriam&quot; have numerous variants, such as
*Mariami (Georgian)
*Mariamma, biblical Mariamme, Mariamne
*Məryəm (Azerbaijani)
*Meryem (Kurdish, Turkish)
*Myriam (French)

The spelling in Semitic abjads is &quot;mrym&quot;: Aramaic ܡܪܝܡ, Hebrew מרים, Arabic مريم.

Cyrillic spellings are Мария (&quot;Maríja&quot;) (Russian, Bulgarian), Марыя (&quot;Marýja&quot;) (Belarusian), Марія (&quot;Maríja&quot;) (Ukrainian) and Марија (&quot;Marija&quot;) (Serbian, Macedonian).

Georgian uses მარიამ (&quot;Mariam&quot;) and მარია (&quot;Maria&quot;); Armenian has Մարիամ (&quot;Mariam&quot;).

Chinese has adopted the spelling 瑪麗 (simplified 玛丽, pinyin &quot;Mǎlì&quot;).

The variant &quot;Mariah&quot; (usually pronounced ) was rarely given in the United States prior to the 1990s, when it bounced in popularity, from rank 562 in 1989 to rank 62 in 1998, in imitation of the name of singer Mariah Carey (whose &quot;Vision of Love&quot; topped the charts in 1990).

<doc id="206570" wikidata="Q3062337" url="?curid=206570" title="USS O-12">
<text>USS &quot;O-12&quot; (SS-73) was an O-class submarine of the United States Navy. These later O-boats, &quot;O-11&quot; through &quot;O-16&quot;, were designed by Lake Torpedo Boat to different specifications than the earlier Electric Boat designs. They performed poorly as compared to the Electric Boat units, and are sometimes considered a separate class. The ship was launched in 1917 and entered service with the Navy in 1918 in the Panama Canal Zone.

Taken out of service by the US Navy in 1924, the submarine was leased for use in Arctic exploration in 1930 sponsored by William Randolph Hearst. Renamed Nautilus, the submarine suffered significant damage while exploring the Arctic in 1931 and having recorded significant data while there, Hearst considered the venture a failure. Having returned to Norway to repair the damage, the submarine was returned to the United States Navy there, and they had the submarine towed down a fjord and scuttled in November 1931.

==Service history==
The submarine&#x27;s keel was laid down on 6 March 1916 by the Lake Torpedo Boat Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut. &quot;O-12&quot; was launched on 29 September 1917, sponsored by Mrs. Homer S. Cummings, and commissioned on 18 October 1918. &quot;O-12&quot; spent much of her career as a unit of Submarine Division 1, based at Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone. In 1921, she was awarded a Battle Efficiency Pennant and trophy for gunnery (gun and torpedo). She decommissioned on 17 June 1924 after just five and a half years of service, and was placed in reserve at the Philadelphia Navy Yard.

=== &quot;Nautilus&quot; Arctic Expedition ===
Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 29 July 1930, ex-&quot;O-12&quot; transferred to the United States Shipping Board for conversion by the Philadelphia Navy Yard. She was leased at the rate of one dollar per year to Lake and Danenhower, Inc., of Bridgeport, Connecticut, for use on Hubert Wilkins&#x27;s and Lincoln Ellsworth&#x27;s Arctic Expedition of geophysical investigation. The lease required that she either be returned to the Navy for disposal, or scuttled in at least of water.

On 24 March 1931, she was re-christened &quot;Nautilus&quot;. As Prohibition prevented the use of an alcoholic beverage, she was baptised not with the traditional champagne but rather with a bucket of ice cubes. Great French writer Jules Verne&#x27;s grandson was present at the event, under the French flag, along with Sir Hubert&#x27;s new-wed wife, actress Suzanne Bennett.

Simon Lake furnished &quot;Nautilus&quot; with several pieces of scientific equipment designed for under-ice operations. One was a mechanical probe, much like a trolley pole, that would scrape along the bottom of the ice cap to indicate how much clearance the submarine had below the ice. Others included drills supposedly capable of cutting through of ice to reach fresh air. The vessel&#x27;s torpedo chamber was converted into a moon pool, when its water-tight door was closed, pressure was equalized, so a trap door could be opened, allowing the lowering of scientific instruments. These innovations were tested only cursorily before the boat put to sea.

&quot;Nautilus&quot; with her crew of 20 men was commanded by Captain Sloan Danenhower, son of John Wilson Danenhower, who served aboard during her Arctic expedition. &quot;Nautilus&quot;, on 4 June 1931, began the crossing from New York City, United States, to Plymouth, England, the first leg of the voyage that was planned to take them up the coasts of the North Sea to Spitsbergen and conclude with a dramatic rendezvous at the North Pole with the German airship &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;. On that first leg, however, &quot;Nautilus&quot; encountered a violent storm. Both engines failed, leaving the boat adrift. She was rescued and initially towed into Cork Harbour in Southern Ireland on 22 June where her batteries were re-charged, before being towed to England by where she was repaired.

On 5 August, very late in the year to begin an Arctic expedition, &quot;Nautilus&quot; began making her way through the English Channel and along the Norwegian coast. Another storm again damaged the boat, carrying away her bridge and giving her a permanent list, but after a stop in Tromsø on 11 August, she successfully reached Spitsbergen, where Wilkins allowed only a single day for repairs.

The crew carried out the planned scientific experiments as they pushed on northward, but thick pack ice hindered their progress. The boat was ill-equipped to deal with the extreme cold, lacking insulation and heaters. The fresh water system froze and the hull developed slow leaks.

After ten days, &quot;Nautilus&quot; reached 82°N, the farthest north any vessel had reached under its own power, and preparations began to dive and proceed under the ice. However, the boat refused to respond; the stern planes had been carried away at some unknown earlier time. Without them, the submarine could not control its depth while submerged, and the expedition had to be aborted.

On 31 August, under financial pressure from newspaperman William Randolph Hearst, who had initially promised to pay for the expedition but who indicated by telegraph that Wilkins would not be paid if he did not continue, Wilkins ordered the submarine onward. Captain Danenhower ordered &quot;Nautilus&quot; trimmed down by the bow, and deliberately rammed an ice floe in an attempt to force the boat under. The manoeuvre worked in that &quot;Nautilus&quot; submerged, and became the first submarine to operate under the polar ice cap. However, her unconventional method of diving caused significant damage to her upper works. She was out of radio contact for days, was presumed lost, and rescue efforts were planned. In fact, she had actually travelled only a short distance under the ice before resurfacing through a polynya, but her radios had been badly damaged, requiring days to repair.

The scientific crew continued their experiments, and their findings became the first paper published by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. On 20 September, &quot;Nautilus&quot; returned to Spitsbergen carrying invaluable data and with all crew alive. Hearst, however, considered the expedition a failure and carried out his threat, refusing to pay for the expedition.

=== Fate ===
Following the expedition, &quot;O-12&quot; was returned to the Navy Department. On 30 November 1931 she was towed three miles down the &quot;Byfjorden&quot; (a Norwegian fjord just outside Bergen) and scuttled in of water. In 1981 Norwegian divers found her wreck.

In 1959, was the first submarine to surface at the North Pole and the second submarine (after in 1958) to reach the North Pole. Her crew conducted a tribute to Sir George Hubert Wilkins and scattered his ashes over the North Pole.

In 2010 the research submersible &quot;JAGO&quot; dove to try to locate and inspect &quot;Nautilus&quot;.

<text>A presidential, strong-president, or single-executive system is a form of government in which a head of government (usually titled &quot;president&quot;) heads an executive branch that derives its authority and legitimacy from a source that is separate from the legislative branch. The system was popularized by its inclusion in the Constitution of the United States.

This head of government is often also the head of state. In a presidential system, the head of government is directly or indirectly elected by a group of citizens and is not responsible to the legislature, and the legislature cannot dismiss the president except in extraordinary cases. A presidential system contrasts with a parliamentary system, where the head of government (usually called a prime minister) derives their power from the confidence of an elected legislature, which can dismiss the prime minister with a simple majority.

Not all presidential systems use the title of &quot;president&quot;. Likewise, the title is sometimes used by other systems. It originated from a time when such a person personally presided over the governing body, as with the President of the Continental Congress in the early United States, before the executive function being split into a separate branch of government. Presidents may also use it in semi-presidential systems. Heads of state of parliamentary republics, largely ceremonial in most cases, are called presidents. Dictators or leaders of one-party states, whether popularly elected or not, are also often called presidents.

The presidential system is the most common form of government in the Americas and is also frequently found in Sub-Saharan Africa (along with semi-presidential hybrid systems). By contrast, there are very few presidential republics in Europe (with Cyprus and Turkey being the only examples). In Asia, the system is used by South Korea, the Philippines, and Indonesia.

== History ==
=== Development in the Americas ===
The presidential system has its roots in the governance of the British colonies of the 17th century in what is now the United States. The Pilgrims, permitted to govern themselves in Plymouth Colony, established a system that utilized an independent executive branch. Each year, a governor was chosen by the colonial legislature, as well as several assistants, analogous to modern-day cabinets. Additional executive officials such as constables and messengers were then appointed. At the same time, the British Isles underwent a brief period of republicanism as the Protectorate, during which the Lord Protector served as an executive leader similar to a president.

The first true presidential system was developed during the United States Constitutional Convention in 1787. Drawing inspiration from the previous colonial governments, from English Common Law, and from philosophers such as John Locke and Montesquieu, the delegates developed what is now known as the presidential system. Most notably, James Wilson advocated for a unitary executive figure that would become the role of the president. The United States became the first presidential republic when the Constitution of the United States came into force in 1789, and George Washington became the first president under a presidential system.

During the 1810s and 1820s, Spanish colonies in the Americas sought independence, and several new Spanish-speaking governments emerged in Latin America. These countries modeled their constitutions after that of the United States, and the presidential system became the dominant political system in the Americas. Following several decades of monarchy, Brazil also adopted the presidential system in 1889 with Deodoro da Fonseca as its first president. Latin American presidential systems have experienced varying levels of stability, with many experiencing periods of dictatorial rule.

=== As a global system ===
Following the pattern of other Spanish colonies, the Philippines established the first presidential system in Asia in 1898, but it fell under American control due to the Spanish–American War. The presidential system was restored after the United States granted the Philippines independence in 1946.

The end of World War II established presidential systems in two countries. After the United States ended the Japanese occupation of Korea, it assisted South Korea in the formation of a presidential government. However, the early years of the South Korean presidency were marked by dictatorial control. At the same time, Indonesia declared independence from the Netherlands in 1945. While it nominally used a presidential system, it was in effect a dictatorship where the president controlled all branches of government. A true presidential system was established in 1998.

Decolonization in the 1950s and 1960s brought with it significant expansion of the presidential system. During this time, several new presidential republics were formed in Africa.{{citation needed |date=February 2025}} Cyprus, the Maldives, and South Vietnam also adopted the presidential system following decolonization. Pakistan and Bangladesh did so as well, but they changed their governmental systems shortly afterwards.

Several more countries adopted the presidential system in the final decades of the 20th century. A modified version of the presidential system was implemented in Iran following constitutional reform in 1989 in which the Supreme Leader serves as the head of state and is the absolute power in this country. In 1981, Palau achieved independence and adopted a presidential system. When the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991, the presidential system was adopted by the new states that were created, though most of them adopted other governmental systems over the following decades.

The presidential system continues to be adopted in the 21st century. Following its independence in 2011, South Sudan adopted a presidential system. In 2018, after the 2017 Turkish constitutional referendum, Turkey adopted a presidential system.

== Features ==
Several characteristics are unique to presidential systems or prominent in countries that use presidential systems. The defining aspect of presidential systems is the separation of powers that divides the executive and the legislature. Advocates of presidential systems cite the democratic nature of presidential elections, the advantages of separation of powers, the efficiency of a unitary executive, and the stability provided by fixed terms. Opponents of presidential systems cite the potential for gridlock, the difficulty of changing leadership, and concerns that a unitary executive can give way to a dictatorship.

=== Separation of powers ===
{{Main|Separation of powers}}
The presidential system is defined by the separation of the executive branch from other aspects of government. The head of government is elected to work alongside, but not as a part of, the legislature. There are several types of powers that are traditionally delegated to the president. Under a presidential system, the president may have the power to challenge legislation through a veto, the power to pardon crimes, authority over foreign policy, authority to command the military as the Commander-in-chief, and authority over advisors and employees of the executive branch.{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}}

==== Checks and balances ====
Separation of powers is sometimes held up as an advantage, in that each branch may scrutinize the actions of the other. This is in contrast with a parliamentary system, where the majority party in the legislature that also serves as the executive is unlikely to scrutinize its actions. Writing about the Watergate scandal, former British MP Woodrow Wyatt said &quot;Don&#x27;t think a Watergate couldn&#x27;t happen here, you just wouldn&#x27;t hear about it.&quot; The extent of this effect is debated. Some commentators argue that the effect is mitigated when the president&#x27;s party is in power, while others note that party discipline is not as strictly enforced in presidential systems.

Another stated benefit of the separation of powers is the ability of the legislature to enforce limits on the powers of the executive. In a parliamentary system, if important legislation proposed by the incumbent prime minister and his cabinet is &quot;voted down&quot; by a majority of the members of parliament then it is considered a vote of no confidence. The presidential system has no such mechanism, and the legislature has little incentive to appease the president beyond saving face.{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}}

==== Efficiencies and inefficiencies ====
When an action is within the scope of a president&#x27;s power, a presidential system can respond more rapidly to emerging situations than parliamentary ones. A prime minister, when taking action, needs to retain the support of the legislature, but a president is often less constrained. In &quot;Why England Slept&quot;, future U.S. president John F. Kennedy argued that British prime ministers Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain were constrained by the need to maintain the confidence of the Commons.

James Wilson, who advocated for a presidential system at the constitutional convention, maintained that a single chief executive would provide for greater public accountability than a group and thereby protect against tyranny by making it plain who was responsible for executive actions. He also submitted that a singular chief executive was necessary to ensure promptness and consistency and guard against deadlock, which could be essential in times of national emergency.

Conversely, a presidential system can produce gridlock when the president and the legislature are in opposition. This rarely happens in a parliamentary system, as the prime minister is always a member of the party in power. This gridlock is a common occurrence, as the electorate often expects more rapid results than are possible from new policies and switches to a different party at the next election. Critics such as Juan Linz, argue that in such cases of gridlock, presidential systems do not offer voters the kind of accountability seen in parliamentary systems and that this inherent political instability can cause democracies to fail, as seen in such cases as Brazil and Allende&#x27;s Chile.

It is easy for either the president or the legislature to escape blame by shifting it to the other. Describing the United States, former Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon said, &quot;The president blames Congress, the Congress blames the president, and the public remains confused and disgusted with the government in Washington&quot;. Years before becoming president, Woodrow Wilson famously wrote &quot;how is the schoolmaster, the nation, to know which boy needs the whipping?&quot; Walter Bagehot said of the American system, &quot;The executive is crippled by not getting the law it needs, and the legislature is spoiled by having to act without responsibility: the executive becomes unfit for its name since it cannot execute what it decides on; the legislature is demoralized by liberty, by taking decisions of which others [and not itself] will suffer the effects&quot;.

A 2024 meta-analytical review found that presidential systems were associated with more corruption than parliamentary systems.

=== Presidential elections ===
{{Main|Fixed-term election}}
In a presidential system, the president is elected independently of the legislature. This may be done directly through a popular vote or indirectly such as through the electoral college used in the United States. This aspect of the presidential system is sometimes touted as more democratic, as it provides a broader mandate for the president. Once elected, a president typically remains in office until the conclusion of a term.

==== Fixed-terms ====
Presidential systems are typically understood as having a head of government elected by citizens to serve one or more fixed terms. Fixed terms are praised for providing a level of stability that other systems lack.

Proponents of the presidential system also argue that stability extends to the cabinets chosen under the system. In most parliamentary systems, cabinets must be drawn from within the legislative branch. Under the presidential system, cabinet members can be selected from a much larger pool of potential candidates. This allows presidents the ability to select cabinet members based as much or more on their ability and competency to lead a particular department as on their loyalty to the president, as opposed to parliamentary cabinets, which might be filled by legislators chosen for no better reason than their perceived loyalty to the prime minister.

Some political scientists dispute this concept of stability, arguing that presidential systems have difficulty sustaining democratic practices and that they have slipped into authoritarianism in many of the countries in which they have been implemented. According to political scientist Fred Riggs, presidential systems have fallen into authoritarianism in nearly every country they&#x27;ve been attempted. The list of the world&#x27;s 22 older democracies includes only two countries (Costa Rica and the United States) with presidential systems. Yale political scientist Juan Linz argues that:

{{blockquote|The danger that zero-sum presidential elections pose is compounded by the rigidity of the president&#x27;s fixed term in office. Winners and losers are sharply defined for the entire period of the presidential mandate ... losers must wait four or five years without any access to executive power and patronage. The zero-sum game in presidential regimes raises the stakes of presidential elections and inevitably exacerbates their attendant tension and polarization.}}

Fixed terms in a presidential system may also be considered a check on the powers of the executive, contrasting parliamentary systems, which may allow the prime minister to call elections whenever they see fit or orchestrate their vote of no confidence to trigger an election when they cannot get a legislative item passed.

==== Limited mechanisms of removal ====
Unlike in parliamentary systems, the legislature does not have the power to recall a president under the presidential system. However, presidential systems may have methods to remove presidents under extraordinary circumstances, such as a president committing a crime or becoming incapacitated. In some countries, presidents are subject to term limits.

The inability to remove a president early is also the subject of criticism. Even if a president is &quot;proved to be inefficient, even if he becomes unpopular, even if his policy is unacceptable to the majority of his countrymen, he and his methods must be endured until the moment comes for a new election&quot;.

The consistency of a presidency may be seen as beneficial during times of crisis. When in a time of crisis, countries may be better off being led by a president with a fixed term than rotating premierships.{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}} Some critics, however, argue that the presidential system is weaker because it does not allow a transfer of power in the event of an emergency. Walter Bagehot argues that the ideal ruler in times of calm is different from the ideal ruler in times of crisis, criticizing the presidential system for having no mechanism to make such a change.

==== Heightened status ====

The president&#x27;s status as both head of government and head of state is sometimes the subject of criticism. Dana D. Nelson criticizes the office of the President of the United States as essentially undemocratic and characterizes presidentialism as worship of the president by citizens, which she believes undermines civic participation. 

== Comparative politics ==
The separation of the executive and the legislature is the key difference between a presidential system and a parliamentary system. The presidential system elects a head of government independently of the legislature, while in contrast, the head of government in a parliamentary system answers directly to the legislature. Presidential systems necessarily operate under the principle of structural separation of powers, while parliamentary systems do not; however, the degree of functional separation of powers exhibited in each varies – dualistic parliamentary systems such as the Netherlands, Sweden and Slovakia forbid members of the legislature from serving in the executive simultaneously, while Westminster-type parliamentary systems such as the United Kingdom require it. Heads of government under the presidential system do not depend on the approval of the legislature as they do in a parliamentary system (except for mechanisms such as impeachment).

The presidential system and the parliamentary system can also be blended into a semi-presidential system. Under such a system, executive power is shared by an elected head of state (a president) and a legislature-appointed head of government (a prime minister or premier). The amount of power each figure holds may vary, and a semi-presidential system may lean closer to one system over the other. The president typically retains authority over foreign policy in a semi-presidential system.{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}} A pure presidential system may also have mechanisms that resemble those of a parliamentary system as part of checks and balances. The legislature may have oversight of some of the president&#x27;s decisions through advice and consent, and mechanisms such as impeachment may allow the legislature to remove the president under drastic circumstances.{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}}

=== Presidentialism metrics ===
Presidentialism metrics allow a quantitative comparison of the strength of presidential system characteristics for individual countries. Presidentialism metrics include the presidential index in V-Dem Democracy indices and presidential power scores. The table below shows for individual countries the V-Dem presidential index, where higher values indicate higher concentration of political power in the hands of one individual.
{{Sticky header}}
=== Subnational governments ===
{{See also|State governments of the United States}}

Subnational governments may be structured as presidential systems. All of the state governments in the United States use the presidential system, even though this is not constitutionally required. In these cases, instead of the title of the President, the role has the title of Governor. On a local level, a presidential system might be organized with the office of the Mayor acting as the president. Some countries without a presidential system at the national level use a form of this system at a subnational or local level. One example is Japan, where the national government uses the parliamentary system.

<text>A figurehead is a carved wooden decoration found at the bow of ships, generally of a design related to the name or role of a ship. They were predominant between the sixteenth and twentieth centuries, and modern ships&#x27; badges fulfil a similar role. 

== History ==

Early ships often had some form of bow ornamentation (e.g. the eyes painted on the bows of Greek and Phoenician galleys, the Roman practice of putting carvings of their deities on the bows of their galleys, and the Viking ships of ca. A.D. 800–1100). The menacing appearance of toothy and bug-eyed figureheads on Viking ships were considered a form of apotropaic magic, serving the function of warding off evil spirits. 

The Ancient Egyptians placed figures of holy birds on the prow. A wall relief at Medinet Habu depicting Ramses III defeating the Sea Peoples in the Battle of the Nile Delta circa 1200 BC depicts Ancient Egiptian ships with a fierce lioness figurehead carved on the bow of two of the ships. Likely this depicted their warrior goddess, Sekhmet, who was seen as their protector. The Phoenicians used horses representing speed. The Ancient Greeks used the heads of boars to symbolise acute vision and ferocity while Roman boats often mounted a carving of a centurion representing valour in battle. In northern Europe, serpents, bulls, dolphins, and dragons were customary and by the thirteenth century, the swan was used representing grace and mobility.

In Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, it was once believed that spirits or faeries called &quot;Kaboutermannekes&quot; (gnomes, little men, faeries) dwelt in the figureheads. The spirit guarded the ship from sickness, rocks, storms, and dangerous winds. If the ship sank, the &quot;Kaboutermannekes&quot; guided the sailors&#x27; souls to the Land of the Dead. To sink without a &quot;Kaboutermanneke&quot; condemned the sailor&#x27;s soul to haunt the sea forever, so Dutch sailors believed. A similar belief was found in early Scandinavia.
In pre-colonial Burma, during the Konbaung dynasty, figureheads were used to distinguish several types of royal barges allocated to different members of the royal court; each barge had a specific mythical figurehead at the front.

A general practice of figureheads was introduced in Europe with the galleons of the sixteenth century, as the figurehead as such could not come to be until ships had a stemhead structure on which to place it. During the period from the seventeenth to the eighteenth centuries the carved subjects of figureheads varied from representations of saints to patriotic emblems such as the unicorns or lions popular on British ships. When the ship was named after a royal or naval personage the head and bust of the individual might be shown.

As with the stern ornamentation, the purpose of the figurehead was often to indicate the name of the ship in a non-literate society (albeit in a sometimes very convoluted manner); and always, in the case of naval ships, to demonstrate the wealth and might of the owner. At the height of the Baroque period, some ships boasted gigantic figureheads, weighing several tons and sometimes twinned on both sides of the bowsprit.

A large figurehead, being carved from massive wood and perched on the very foremost tip of the hull, adversely affected the sailing qualities of the ship. This, and cost considerations, led to figureheads being made dramatically smaller during the eighteenth century, and in some cases they were abolished altogether around 1800. After the Napoleonic wars they made something of a comeback, but were then often in the form of a small waist-up bust rather than the oversized full figures previously used. The clipper ships of the 1850s and 1860s customarily had full figureheads, but these were relatively small and light. During their final stage of common use figureheads ranged in length from about to .

=== Decline in use ===

Figureheads as such died out with the military sailing ship. In addition the vogue for ram bows meant that there was no obvious place to mount one on battleships. An exception was which was the last British battleship to carry a figurehead. Smaller ships of the Royal Navy continued to carry them. The last example may well have been the sloop launched in 1903. Her sister ship was the last to sport a figurehead until her breaking up in 1923.
Early steamships sometimes had gilt scroll-work and coats-of-arms at their bows. This practice lasted up until about World War I. The 1910 German liner originally sported a large bronze figurehead of an eagle (the Imperial German symbol) standing on a globe. The few extra feet of length added by the figurehead made &quot;Imperator&quot; the longest ship in the world at the time of her launch.

It is still common practise for warships to carry ships&#x27; badges, large plaques mounted on the superstructure with a unique design relating to the ship&#x27;s name or role. For example, Type 42 destroyers of the Royal Navy, which are named after British cities, carry badges depicting the coat of arms of their namesake.

On smaller vessels, a &quot;billethead&quot; might be substituted. This was a smaller, nonfigural carving, most often a curl of foliage.

<text>John Blackwood FRSE (1818-1879) was a Scottish editor and publisher, sixth son of William Blackwood, founder of the publishing company William Blackwood &amp; Sons. In 1845, John Blackwood became manager and editor of &quot;Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine&quot; (aka &quot;Maga&quot;) after the death of his oldest brother, Alexander, later becoming head of the firm at the death of his brother Robert. Blackwood died in 1879, having managed the company for thirty-four years, the longest of all the Blackwood editors.

==Life==

John Blackwood was born at 2 Salisbury Road in south Edinburgh on 7 December 1818. Educated at the High School in Edinburgh and the University of Edinburgh, as a young man Blackwood displayed literary tastes, procuring for himself the nickname &quot;the little Editor&quot;. At age 16, Blackwood spent three years in continental travel during his Grand Tour with his brother Alexander and his tutor, Mr. William Hay. In Europe, Blackwood excelled in French and Italian, keeping much of his language skill during his adult life, and met Wordsworth.

In 1838, Blackwood began work in London learning the publishing trade at Whittaker &amp; Co. In 1840, Blackwood&#x27;s older brothers gave John the responsibility of managing the London business at 22 Pall Mall and five years later at 37 Paternoster Row. Blackwood&#x27;s office became a place for literary rendezvous, with visitors such as John Gibson Lockhart of the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;; John Delane, editor of &quot;The Times&quot;; and William Makepeace Thackeray, author for &quot;Punch&quot; and of the novel &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. The latter two associates became intimate friends with Blackwood. One of Blackwood&#x27;s functions in London was to recruit authors for &quot;Maga&quot;, and it was in London that Blackwood formed an association with Lord Edward Bulwer-Lytton, who began in 1842 to contribute to the magazine his translation of the poems and ballads of Friedrich Schiller. In 1845, Blackwood returned to Edinburgh to manage and edit &quot;Maga&quot; after the death of Alexander, while his brother Robert maintained the business side of the magazine. At the death of Robert in 1852, John became head of William Blackwood &amp; Sons publishing house. Then John&#x27;s brother Major William Blackwood II shared the partnership with John until his death in 1861, when his son, William Blackwood III, became partner and worked side by side with John.

Although Blackwood was a staunch conservative and published the chief monthly periodical of conservatism, he welcomed authors without regard to political affiliations. As editor, he sought quality of writing over name recognition and worked quickly and efficiently. He recognized what the public wanted and carefully chose the best author who would handle the subject. Blackwood managed his team firmly and with a notable sense of humor, tactfully warding off authorial concerns. Above all, Blackwood maintained amiable and intimate relations with many authors, famously declaring in a speech he gave at the 1871 Scott Centenary Banquet at St. Andrews, Scotland, that &quot;Authors had been his dearest friends and companions all the days of his life&quot; and that &quot;he could turn [to them] in joy and sorrow for safe and certain sympathy&quot;.

Blackwood&#x27;s most famous literary relationship was with George Eliot, author of &quot;Middlemarch&quot;. In 1856, George Henry Lewes, Eliot&#x27;s companion and business partner, introduced Eliot to Blackwood through her short story, &quot;The Sad Fortunes of the Reverend Amos Barton&quot;, first in a series of stories later combined as &quot;Scenes of Clerical Life&quot;, and Blackwood immediately recognized her talent. Consistently encouraging Eliot, Blackwood became an important part of Eliot&#x27;s growth in confidence, and she wrote all of her books for Blackwood&#x27;s except one, &quot;Romola&quot;. This commencement of a business connection with Eliot soon developed into one of friendship that lasted their lives. Upon the final illness that preceded the death of Blackwood, Eliot wrote to Lewes&#x27;s son, &quot;He will be a heavy loss to me. He has been bound up with what I most cared for in my life for more than twenty years and his good qualities have made many things easy to me that without him would often have been difficult&quot;.

For the last twenty years of his life, Blackwood split his home between Strathtyrum, his rented country house near St. Andrews, Scotland, and owned by the Cheape family, and his home in the New Town of Edinburgh at 3 Randolph Crescent on the southern edge of the Moray Estate. He also often worked in London. A passionate lover of golf, Blackwood played every afternoon while at his country home, enjoying the famed Links near St. Andrews such a short distance from Strathtyrum. Often with his family, in evenings Blackwood walked to the nearby North Sea adjacent to the property and viewed St. Andrews Bay and the Bell Rock Lighthouse. A wide variety of guests enjoyed visiting Strathtyrum, including Anthony Trollope, author of &quot;Framley Parsonage&quot;; Jefferson Davis, president of the former Confederate States; and Captain John Hanning Speke, discoverer of the source of the Nile.

Married in 1854, Blackwood and his wife Julia had two children: Mary, who would later write volume three of the &quot;Annals of a Publishing House&quot;, which focused on the life of her father; and John, or, Jack, who died in 1882 at the young age of 25, having served in Sir Arthur Halkett&#x27;s Militia in 1878.

John Blackwood died at Strathtyrum House on 29 October 1879. Blackwood is buried on a small west-facing section of wall on the southern edge of Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh. A secondary memorial to John is within his father&#x27;s family vault in Old Calton Burial Ground.

To this day, the Blackwood family still live in Ayrshire, Scotland, around the Doon Valley area and other parts of Ayrshire.

<text>The Fra Mauro formation (or Fra Mauro Highlands) is a formation on the near side of Earth&#x27;s Moon that served as the landing site for the American Apollo 14 mission in 1971. It is named after the 80-kilometer-diameter crater Fra Mauro, located within it. The formation, as well as Fra Mauro crater, take their names from a 15th-century Italian monk and mapmaker of the same name. Apollo 13 was originally scheduled to land in the Fra Mauro highlands, but was unable due to an in-flight technical failure.

Fra Mauro is thought to have been formed from ejecta, or debris, from the impact which formed Mare Imbrium. During Apollo 14, the crew members sampled ejecta from Cone crater, a feature close in proximity to the immediate landing site of the mission, which provided insight into the composition of material deep inside the formation. Data from the mission has helped to determine the approximate age of Mare Imbrium, suggesting that it is no more than about 4.25 billion years old.

==Formation and geography==

Fra Mauro is a widespread hilly geological area covering large portions of the lunar surface around Mare Imbrium, and is thought to be composed of ejecta from the impact which formed Imbrium. The area is primarily composed of relatively low ridges and hills, between which exist undulating valleys. Much of the ejecta blanket from the Imbrium impact is covered with debris from younger impacts and material churned up by possible moonquakes. Debris found in the formation may have originated from deep beneath the original crust, and samples collected there could give insight into the geologic history of the Moon. The petrology of the formation, based on data obtained on Apollo 14, indicates a history of impact and ejection possibly spanning over approximately 500 million years.

A relatively recent impact created Cone crater, 1,000 feet across and 250 feet deep, near the landing site of Apollo 14. One of the main objectives of that mission was to sample the original Imbrium material located on its rim.

Samples obtained of the Fra Mauro formation during Apollo 14 suggest that the impact that formed the Imbrium basin is no older than 4.25 billion years.

==Geology==

Analysis of Apollo 14 samples suggests that there are five major geologic constituents present in the immediate landing area: regolith breccias, fragmental breccias, igneous lithologies, granulitic lithologies, and impact-melt lithologies. Samples of each of these compositions were recovered in one or both of two major surface units of the Apollo 14 landing site within Fra Mauro: the immediate impact blanket of Cone crater, about 25 million years old, and surrounding older terrain.

During Apollo 14, astronauts Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell recovered ejecta material from the Cone crater impact, which is believed to have excavated Imbrium impact material from a possible depth of about . Most of the samples returned from the Moon from Fra Mauro are classified as breccias from the vicinity of Cone crater.

Studies conducted upon samples from Apollo 14 have shown that the samples do not support the possibility that the landing site is floored by volcanic rocks, or basalts. Basalts are sparse in samples of Cone crater ejecta, but somewhat abundant in samples recovered farther west, on the opposite side of the immediate landing site. Two explanations have been presented for this: (1) the majority of basalt in the landing site lies below the depth of excavation of Cone crater or (2) the presence of a basalt flow beneath the landing area excavated by a nearby crater with a diameter of . It is believed that the former seems more likely, as the basalts are similar to the basalts recovered at Cone crater. It is inconclusive whether or not the recovered basalts have a direct affiliation with the landing site, as it is located in a valley between ridges, and there exists the possibility that the basalts were merely deposited there as a result of other impact events.

The Apollo 14 crew members sampled boulders in the ejecta of Cone crater. These boulders appeared to be layered and fractured breccias, contrasting from the appearance of the surrounding area because of their older age. As these boulders increase in size and number closer to Cone crater, it is believed that they originate from the greatest depth of excavation of Cone crater. These boulders show what is believed to be general characteristics of the Fra Mauro formation: clastic texture, stratification, and jointing or fracturing.

==Landing site selection==

As Apollo 14 was an early Apollo mission, consideration for landing sites was restricted to equatorial regions in order to enable the Moon-bound spacecraft to remain on a free-return trajectory should the Apollo Service Module engine fail. After Apollo 12 demonstrated the ability to land with some degree of precision at a pre-specified landing site, mission planners considered landings in rough, but geologically interesting areas of the Moon.

The aborted Apollo 13 mission was originally scheduled to land at Fra Mauro, with Apollo 14 scheduled to land in the Littrow region of Mare Serenitatis. After Apollo 13 failed to land, mission planners decided to re-target Apollo 14 to Fra Mauro, as they regarded Fra Mauro as more interesting scientifically than the Littrow site. There, Apollo 14 had the objective of sampling ejecta from the Imbrium impact to gain insight into the Moon&#x27;s geologic history. Mission planners chose a landing site near the relatively freshly formed Cone crater, as this crater served as a &#x27;natural drill hole&#x27; to allow the astronauts to obtain Imbrium ejecta, a primary objective of the mission.

<text>Suffering, or pain in a broad sense, may be an experience of unpleasantness or aversion, possibly associated with the perception of harm or threat of harm in an individual. Suffering is the basic element that makes up the negative valence of affective phenomena. The opposite of suffering is pleasure or happiness.

Suffering is often categorized as physical or mental. It may come in all degrees of intensity, from mild to intolerable. Factors of duration and frequency of occurrence usually compound that of intensity. Attitudes toward suffering may vary widely, in the sufferer or other people, according to how much it is regarded as avoidable or unavoidable, useful or useless, deserved or undeserved.

Suffering occurs in the lives of sentient beings in numerous manners, often dramatically. As a result, many fields of human activity are concerned with some aspects of suffering. These aspects may include the nature of suffering, its processes, its origin and causes, its meaning and significance, its related personal, social, and cultural behaviors, its remedies, management, and uses.

==Terminology==
The word &quot;suffering&quot; is sometimes used in the narrow sense of physical pain, but more often it refers to psychological pain, or more often yet it refers to pain in the broad sense, i.e. to any unpleasant feeling, emotion or sensation. The word &quot;pain&quot; usually refers to physical pain, but it is also a common synonym of &quot;suffering&quot;. The words &quot;pain&quot; and &quot;suffering&quot; are often used both together in different ways. For instance, they may be used as interchangeable synonyms. Or they may be used in &#x27;contradistinction&#x27; to one another, as in &quot;pain is physical, suffering is mental&quot;, or &quot;pain is inevitable, suffering is optional&quot;. Or they may be used to define each other, as in &quot;pain is physical suffering&quot;, or &quot;suffering is severe physical or mental pain&quot;.

Qualifiers, such as &quot;physical&quot;, &quot;mental&quot;, &quot;emotional&quot;, and &quot;psychological&quot;, are often used to refer to certain types of pain or suffering. In particular, &quot;mental pain (or suffering)&quot; may be used in relationship with &quot;physical pain (or suffering)&quot; for distinguishing between two wide categories of pain or suffering. A first caveat concerning such a distinction is that it uses &quot;physical pain&quot; in a sense that normally includes not only the &#x27;typical sensory experience of physical pain&#x27; but also other unpleasant bodily experiences including air hunger, hunger, vestibular suffering, nausea, sleep deprivation, and itching. A second caveat is that the terms &quot;physical&quot; or &quot;mental&quot; should not be taken too literally: physical pain or suffering, as a matter of fact, happens through conscious minds and involves emotional aspects, while mental pain or suffering happens through physical brains and, being an emotion, involves important physiological aspects.

The word &quot;unpleasantness&quot;, which some people use as a synonym of &quot;suffering&quot; or &quot;pain&quot; in the broad sense, may refer to the basic affective dimension of pain (its suffering aspect), usually in contrast with the sensory dimension, as for instance in this sentence: &quot;Pain-unpleasantness is often, though not always, closely linked to both the intensity and unique qualities of the painful sensation.&quot; Other current words that have a definition with some similarity to &quot;suffering&quot; include &quot;distress, unhappiness, misery, affliction, woe, ill, discomfort, displeasure, disagreeableness&quot;.

==Philosophy==

===Ancient Greek philosophy===
Many of the Hellenistic philosophies addressed suffering.

In Cynicism suffering is alleviated by achieving mental clarity or lucidity (ἁτυφια: atyphia), developing self-sufficiency (αὐτάρκεια: autarky), equanimity, arete, love of humanity, parrhesia, and indifference to the vicissitudes of life (adiaphora).

For Pyrrhonism, suffering comes from dogmas (i.e. beliefs regarding non-evident matters), most particularly beliefs that certain things are either good or bad by nature. Suffering can be removed by developing epoche (suspension of judgment) regarding beliefs, which leads to ataraxia (mental tranquility).
Epicurus (contrary to common misperceptions of his doctrine) advocated that we should first seek to avoid suffering (aponia) and that the greatest pleasure lies in ataraxia, free from the worrisome pursuit or the unwelcome consequences of ephemeral pleasures. Epicureanism&#x27;s version of Hedonism, as an ethical theory, claims that good and bad consist ultimately in pleasure and pain.

For Stoicism, the greatest good lies in reason and virtue, but the soul best reaches it through a kind of indifference (apatheia) to pleasure and pain: as a consequence, this doctrine has become identified with stern self-control in regard to suffering.

===Modern philosophy===

Jeremy Bentham developed hedonistic utilitarianism, a popular doctrine in ethics, politics, and economics. Bentham argued that the right act or policy was that which would cause &quot;the greatest happiness of the greatest number&quot;. He suggested a procedure called hedonic or felicific calculus, for determining how much pleasure and pain would result from any action. John Stuart Mill improved and promoted the doctrine of hedonistic utilitarianism. Karl Popper, in &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot;, proposed a negative utilitarianism, which prioritizes the reduction of suffering over the enhancement of happiness when speaking of utility: &quot;I believe that there is, from the ethical point of view, no symmetry between suffering and happiness, or between pain and pleasure. ... human suffering makes a direct moral appeal for help, while there is no similar call to increase the happiness of a man who is doing well anyway.&quot; David Pearce, for his part, advocates a utilitarianism that aims straightforwardly at the abolition of suffering through the use of biotechnology (see more details below in section Biology, neurology, psychology). Another aspect worthy of mention here is that many utilitarians since Bentham hold that the moral status of a being comes from its ability to feel pleasure and pain: therefore, moral agents should consider not only the interests of human beings but also those of (other) animals. Richard Ryder came to the same conclusion in his concepts of &#x27;speciesism&#x27; and &#x27;painism&#x27;. Peter Singer&#x27;s writings, especially the book &quot;Animal Liberation&quot;, represent the leading edge of this kind of utilitarianism for animals as well as for people.

Another doctrine related to the relief of suffering is humanitarianism (see also humanitarian principles, humanitarian aid, and humane society). &quot;Where humanitarian efforts seek a positive addition to the happiness of sentient beings, it is to make the unhappy happy rather than the happy happier. ... [Humanitarianism] is an ingredient in many social attitudes; in the modern world it has so penetrated into diverse movements ... that it can hardly be said to exist in itself.&quot;

Pessimists hold this world to be mainly bad, or even the worst possible, plagued with, among other things, unbearable and unstoppable suffering. Some identify suffering as the nature of the world and conclude that it would be better if life did not exist at all. Arthur Schopenhauer recommends us to take refuge in things like art, philosophy, loss of the will to live, and tolerance toward &#x27;fellow-sufferers&#x27;.

Friedrich Nietzsche, first influenced by Schopenhauer, developed afterward quite another attitude, arguing that the suffering of life is productive, exalting the will to power, despising weak compassion or pity, and recommending us to embrace willfully the &#x27;eternal return&#x27; of the greatest sufferings. 

Philosophy of pain is a philosophical speciality that focuses on physical pain and is, through that, relevant to suffering in general.

==Religion==
Suffering plays an important role in a number of religions, regarding matters such as the following: consolation or relief; moral conduct (do no harm, help the afflicted, show compassion); spiritual advancement through life hardships or through self-imposed trials (mortification of the flesh, penance, asceticism); ultimate destiny (salvation, damnation, hell). Theodicy deals with the problem of evil, which is the difficulty of reconciling the existence of an omnipotent and benevolent god with the existence of evil. &quot;Several attempts were made to preserve together both monotheism and God’s attributes from types of dualism (e. g. Gnosticism, Paulicianism, Catharism) and the idea of God’s reduced number of attributes, due to the tension between the existence of evil and the divine omnipotence and omnibenevolence.&quot; A quintessential form of evil, for many people, is extreme suffering, especially in innocent children, or in creatures destined to an eternity of torments (see problem of hell).

The &#x27;Four Noble Truths&#x27; of Buddhism are about dukkha, a term often translated as suffering. They state the nature of suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation, the Noble Eightfold Path. Buddhism considers liberation from &quot;dukkha&quot; and the practice of compassion (karuna) as basic for leading a holy life and attaining nirvana.

Hinduism holds that suffering follows naturally from personal negative behaviors in one&#x27;s current life or in a past life (see karma in Hinduism). One must accept suffering as a just consequence and as an opportunity for spiritual progress. Thus the soul or true self, which is eternally free of any suffering, may come to manifest itself in the person, who then achieves liberation (moksha). Abstinence from causing pain or harm to other beings, called ahimsa, is a central tenet of Hinduism, and even more so of another Indian religion, Jainism (see ahimsa in Jainism).

In Judaism, suffering is often seen as a punishment for sins and a test of a person&#x27;s faith, like the Book of Job illustrates.

For Christianity, redemptive suffering is the belief that human suffering, when accepted and offered up in union with the &quot;passion&quot; (flogging and crucifixion) of Jesus, can remit the just punishment for sins, and allow oneself to grow in the love of The Trinity, other people, and oneself. 

In Islam, the faithful must endure suffering with hope and faith, not resist or ask why, accept it as Allah&#x27;s will and submit to it as a test of faith. Allah never asks more than can be endured. One must also work to alleviate the suffering of others, as well as one&#x27;s own. Suffering is also seen as a blessing. Through that gift, the sufferer remembers Allah and connects with him. Suffering expunges the sins of human beings and cleanses their soul for the immense reward of the afterlife, and the avoidance of hell.

According to the Bahá&#x27;í Faith, all suffering is a brief and temporary manifestation of physical life, whose source is the material aspects of physical existence, and often attachment to them, whereas only joy exists in the spiritual worlds.

==Arts and literature==

Artistic and literary works often engage with suffering, sometimes at great cost to their creators or performers. Be it in the tragic, comic or other genres, art and literature offer means to alleviate (and perhaps also exacerbate) suffering, as argued for instance in Harold Schweizer&#x27;s &quot;Suffering and the remedy of art&quot;.

This Bruegel painting is among those that inspired W. H. Auden&#x27;s poem Musée des Beaux Arts:

&quot;About suffering they were never wrong,&quot; 
&quot;The Old Masters; how well, they understood&quot; 
&quot;Its human position; how it takes place&quot; 
&quot;While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along;&quot;
&quot;In Breughel&#x27;s Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away&quot; 
&quot;Quite leisurely from the disaster; (...)&quot;

==Social sciences==

&quot;Social suffering&quot;, according to Arthur Kleinman and others, describes &quot;collective and individual human suffering associated with life conditions shaped by powerful social forces&quot;. Such suffering is an increasing concern in medical anthropology, ethnography, mass media analysis, and Holocaust studies, says Iain Wilkinson, who is developing a sociology of suffering.

The &quot;Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential&quot; is a work by the Union of International Associations. Its main databases are about world problems (56,564 profiles), global strategies and solutions (32,547 profiles), human values (3,257 profiles), and human development (4,817 profiles). It states that &quot;the most fundamental entry common to the core parts is that of pain (or suffering)&quot; and &quot;common to the core parts is the learning dimension of new understanding or insight in response to suffering&quot;.

Ralph Siu, an American author, urged in 1988 the &quot;creation of a new and vigorous academic discipline, called panetics, to be devoted to the study of the infliction of suffering&quot;, The International Society for Panetics was founded in 1991 to study and develop ways to reduce the infliction of human suffering by individuals acting through professions, corporations, governments, and other social groups.

In economics, the following notions relate not only to the matters suggested by their positive appellations, but to the matter of suffering as well: Well-being or Quality of life, Welfare economics, Happiness economics, Gross National Happiness, genuine progress indicator.

In law, &quot;Pain and suffering&quot; is a legal term that refers to the mental distress or physical pain endured by a plaintiff as a result of injury for which the plaintiff seeks redress. Assessments of pain and suffering are required to be made for attributing legal awards. In the Western world these are typically made by juries in a discretionary fashion and are regarded as subjective, variable, and difficult to predict, for instance in the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand. See also, in US law, Negligent infliction of emotional distress and Intentional infliction of emotional distress.

In management and organization studies, drawing on the work of Eric Cassell, suffering has been defined as the distress a person experiences when they perceive a threat to any aspect of their continued existence, whether physical, psychological, or social. Other researchers have noted that suffering results from an inability to control actions that usually define one&#x27;s view of one&#x27;s self and that the characteristics of suffering include the loss of autonomy, or the loss of valued relationships or sense of self. Suffering is therefore determined not by the threat itself but, rather, by its meaning to the individual and the threat to their personhood.

==Biology, neurology, psychology==

Suffering and pleasure are respectively the negative and positive affects, or hedonic tones, or valences that psychologists often identify as basic in our emotional lives. The evolutionary role of physical and mental suffering, through natural selection, is primordial: it warns of threats, motivates coping (fight or flight, escapism), and reinforces negatively certain behaviors (see punishment, aversives). Despite its initial disrupting nature, suffering contributes to the organization of meaning in an individual&#x27;s world and psyche. In turn, meaning determines how individuals or societies experience and deal with suffering.

Many brain structures and physiological processes are involved in suffering (particularly the anterior insula and cingulate cortex, both implicated in nociceptive and empathic pain). Various hypotheses try to account for the experience of suffering. One of these, the &quot;pain overlap theory&quot; takes note, thanks to neuroimaging studies, that the cingulate cortex fires up when the brain feels suffering from experimentally induced social distress, as well as physical pain. The theory proposes therefore that physical pain and social pain (i.e. two radically differing kinds of suffering) share a common phenomenological and neurological basis.

According to David Pearce&#x27;s online manifesto &quot;The Hedonistic Imperative&quot;, suffering is the avoidable result of Darwinian evolution. Pearce promotes replacing the biology of suffering with a robot-like response to noxious stimuli or with information-sensitive gradients of bliss, through genetic engineering and other technical scientific advances.

Different theories of psychology view suffering differently. Sigmund Freud viewed suffering as something humans are hardwired to avoid, while they are always in the pursuit of pleasure, also known as the hedonic theory of motivation or the pleasure principle. This dogma also ties in with certain concepts of Behaviorism, most notably Operant Conditioning theory. In operant conditioning, a negative stimulus is removed thereby increasing a desired behavior, alternatively an aversive stimulus can be introduced as a punishing factor. In both methods, unfavorable circumstances are used in order to motivate an individual or an animal towards a certain goal. However, other theories of psychology present contradicting ideas such as the idea that humans sometimes seek out suffering. Many existentialists believe suffering is necessary in order to find meaning in our lives. Existential Positive Psychology is a theory dedicated to exploring the relationship between suffering and happiness and the belief that true authentic happiness can only come from experiencing pain and hardships.

Hedonistic psychology, affective science, and affective neuroscience are some of the emerging scientific fields that could in the coming years focus their attention on the phenomenon of suffering.

==Health care==
Disease and injury may contribute to suffering in humans and animals. For example, suffering may be a feature of mental or physical illness such as borderline personality disorder and occasionally in advanced cancer. Health care addresses this suffering in many ways, in subfields such as medicine, clinical psychology, psychotherapy, alternative medicine, hygiene, public health, and through various health care providers.

Health care approaches to suffering, however, remain problematic. Physician and author Eric Cassell, widely cited on the subject of attending to the suffering person as a primary goal of medicine, has defined suffering as &quot;the state of severe distress associated with events that threaten the intactness of the person&quot;. Cassell writes: &quot;The obligation of physicians to relieve human suffering stretches back to antiquity. Despite this fact, little attention is explicitly given to the problem of suffering in medical education, research or practice.&quot; Mirroring the traditional body and mind dichotomy that underlies its teaching and practice, medicine strongly distinguishes pain from suffering, and most attention goes to the treatment of pain. Nevertheless, physical pain itself still lacks adequate attention from the medical community, according to numerous reports. Besides, some medical fields like palliative care, pain management (or pain medicine), oncology, or psychiatry, do somewhat address suffering &#x27;as such&#x27;. In palliative care, for instance, pioneer Cicely Saunders created the concept of &#x27;total pain&#x27; (&#x27;total suffering&#x27; say now the textbooks), which encompasses the whole set of physical and mental distress, discomfort, symptoms, problems, or needs that a patient may experience hurtfully.

=== Mental illness ===
Gary Greenberg, in &quot;The Book of Woe&quot;, writes that mental illness might best be viewed as medicalization or labeling/naming suffering (i.e. that all mental illnesses might not necessarily be of dysfunction or biological-etiology, but might be social or cultural/societal).

==Relief and prevention in society==
Since suffering is such a universal motivating experience, people, when asked, can relate their activities to its relief and prevention. Farmers, for instance, may claim that they prevent famine, artists may say that they take our minds off our worries, and teachers may hold that they hand down tools for coping with life hazards. In certain aspects of collective life, however, suffering is more readily an explicit concern by itself. Such aspects may include public health, human rights, humanitarian aid, disaster relief, philanthropy, economic aid, social services, insurance, and animal welfare. To these can be added the aspects of security and safety, which relate to precautionary measures taken by individuals or families, to interventions by the military, the police, the firefighters, and to notions or fields like social security, environmental security, and human security.

The nongovernmental research organization Center on Long-Term Risk, formerly known as the Foundational Research Institute, focuses on reducing risks of astronomical suffering (s-risks) from emerging technologies. Another organization also focused on research, the Center on Reducing Suffering, has a similar focus, with a stress on clarifying what priorities there should be at a practical level to attain the goal of reducing intense suffering in the future.

==Uses==
Philosopher Leonard Katz wrote: &quot;But Nature, as we now know, regards ultimately only fitness and not our happiness ... and does not scruple to use hate, fear, punishment and even war alongside affection in ordering social groups and selecting among them, just as she uses pain as well as pleasure to get us to feed, water and protect our bodies and also in forging our social bonds.&quot;

People make use of suffering for specific social or personal purposes in many areas of human life, as can be seen in the following instances:
* In arts, literature, or entertainment, people may use suffering for creation, for performance, or for enjoyment. Entertainment particularly makes use of suffering in blood sports and violence in the media, including violent video games depiction of suffering. A more or less great amount of suffering is involved in body art. The most common forms of body art include tattooing, body piercing, scarification, human branding. Another form of body art is a sub-category of performance art, in which for instance the body is mutilated or pushed to its physical limits.
* In business and various organizations, suffering may be used for constraining humans or animals into required behaviors.
* In a criminal context, people may use suffering for coercion, revenge, or pleasure.
* In interpersonal relationships, especially in places like families, schools, or workplaces, suffering is used for various motives, particularly under the form of abuse and punishment. In another fashion related to interpersonal relationships, the sick, or victims, or malingerers, may use suffering more or less voluntarily to get primary, secondary, or tertiary gain.
* In law, suffering is used for punishment (see penal law); victims may refer to what legal texts call &quot;pain and suffering&quot; to get compensation; lawyers may use a victim&#x27;s suffering as an argument against the accused; an accused&#x27;s or defendant&#x27;s suffering may be an argument in their favor; authorities at times use light or heavy torture in order to get information or a confession.
* In the news media, suffering is often the raw material.
* In personal conduct, people may use suffering for themselves, in a positive way. Personal suffering may lead, if bitterness, depression, or spitefulness is avoided, to character-building, spiritual growth, or moral achievement; realizing the extent or gravity of suffering in the world may motivate one to relieve it and may give an inspiring direction to one&#x27;s life. Alternatively, people may make self-detrimental use of suffering. Some may be caught in compulsive reenactment of painful feelings in order to protect them from seeing that those feelings have their origin in unmentionable past experiences; some may addictively indulge in disagreeable emotions like fear, anger, or jealousy, in order to enjoy pleasant feelings of arousal or release that often accompany these emotions; some may engage in acts of self-harm aimed at relieving otherwise unbearable states of mind.
* In politics, there is purposeful infliction of suffering in war, torture, and terrorism; people may use nonphysical suffering against competitors in nonviolent power struggles; people who argue for a policy may put forward the need to relieve, prevent or avenge suffering; individuals or groups may use past suffering as a political lever in their favor.
* In religion, suffering is used especially to grow spiritually, to expiate, to inspire compassion and help, to frighten, to punish.
* In rites of passage (see also hazing, ragging), rituals that make use of suffering are frequent.
* In science, humans and animals are subjected on purpose to aversive experiences for the study of suffering or other phenomena.
* In sex, especially in a context of sadism and masochism or BDSM, individuals may use a certain amount of physical or mental suffering (e.g. pain, humiliation).
* In sports, suffering may be used to outperform competitors or oneself; see sports injury, and no pain, no gain; see also blood sport and violence in sport as instances of pain-based entertainment.

<doc id="206586" wikidata="Q2207328" url="?curid=206586" title="Technological convergence">
<text>Technological convergence is the tendency for technologies that were originally unrelated to become more closely integrated and even unified as they develop and advance. For example, watches, telephones, television, computers, and social media platforms began as separate and mostly unrelated technologies, but have converged in many ways into an interrelated telecommunication, media, and technology industry.

==Definitions==
&quot;Convergence is a deep integration of knowledge, tools, and all relevant activities of human activity for a common goal, to allow society to answer new questions to change the respective physical or social ecosystem. Such changes in the respective ecosystem open new trends, pathways, and opportunities in the following divergent phase of the process&quot;.

Siddhartha Menon defines convergence as integration and digitalization. Integration, here, is defined as &quot;a process of transformation measure by the degree to which diverse media such as phone, data broadcast and information technology infrastructures are combined into a single seamless all purpose network architecture platform&quot;. Digitalization is not so much defined by its physical infrastructure, but by the content or the medium. Jan van Dijk suggests that &quot;digitalization means breaking down signals into bytes consisting of ones and zeros&quot;.

Convergence is defined by Blackman (1998) as a trend in the evolution of technology services and industry structures. Convergence is later defined more specifically as the coming together of telecommunications, computing and broadcasting into a single digital bit-stream.

Mueller stands against the statement that convergence is really a takeover of all forms of media by one technology: digital computers.

=== Acronyms ===
Some acronyms for converging scientific or technological fields include:
* NBIC (Nanotechnology, Biotechnology, Information technology and Cognitive science)
* GNR (Genetics, Nanotechnology and Robotics)
* GRIN (Genetics, Robotics, Information, and Nano processes)
* GRAIN (Genetics, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Nanotechnology)
* BANG (Bits, Atoms, Neurons, Genes)

== Biotechnology ==
A 2010 citation analysis of patent data shows that biomedical devices are strongly connected to computing and mobile telecommunications, and that molecular bioengineering is strongly connected to several IT fields.

&quot;Bioconvergence&quot; is the integration of biology with engineering. Possible areas of bioconvergence include:
* Materials inspired by biology (such as in electronics)
* DNA data storage
* Medical technologies:
** Omics-based profiling
** Miniaturized drug delivery
** Tissue reconstruction
* Traceable pharmaceutical packaging
* More efficient bioreactors

==Digital convergence==
&quot;Digital convergence&quot; is the inclination for various digital innovations and media to become more similar with time. It enables the convergence of access devices and content as well as the industry participant operations and strategy. This is how this type of technological convergence creates opportunities, particularly in the area of product development and growth strategies for digital product companies. The same can be said in the case of individual content creators, such as vloggers on YouTube. The convergence in this example is demonstrated in the involvement of the Internet, home devices such as smart television, camera, the YouTube application, and digital content. In this setup, there are the so-called &quot;spokes&quot;, which are the devices that connect to a central hub (such as a PC or smart TV). Here, the Internet serves as the intermediary, particularly through its interactivity tools and social networking, in order to create unique mixes of products and services via horizontal integration.

The above example highlights how digital convergence encompasses three phenomena:

# previously stand-alone devices are being connected by networks and software, significantly enhancing functionalities;
# previously stand-alone products are being converged onto the same platform, creating hybrid products in the process; and,
# companies are crossing traditional boundaries such as hardware and software to provide new products and new sources of competition.

Another example is the convergence of different types of digital contents. According to Harry Strasser, former CTO of Siemens &quot;[digital convergence will substantially impact people&#x27;s lifestyle and work style]&quot;.

=== Cellphones ===
The functions of the cellphone changes as technology converges. Because of technological advancement, a cellphone functions as more than just a phone: it can also contain an Internet connection, video players, MP3 players, gaming, and a camera. Their areas of use have increased over time, partly substituting for other devices.

A mobile convergence device is one that, if connected to a keyboard, monitor, and mouse, can run applications as a desktop computer would. Convergent operating systems include the Linux operating systems Ubuntu Touch, Plasma Mobile and PureOS.

Convergence can also refer to being able to run the same app across different devices and being able to develop apps for different devices (such as smartphones, TVs and desktop computers) at once, with the same code base. This can be done via Linux applications that adapt to the device they are being used on (including native apps designed for such via frameworks like Kirigami) or by the use of multi-platform frameworks like the Quasar framework that use tools such as Apache Cordova, Electron and Capacitor, which can increase the userbase, the pace and ease of development and the number of reached platforms while decreasing development costs.

=== The Internet ===
The role of the Internet has changed from its original use as a communication tool to easier and faster access to information and services, mainly through a broadband connection. The television, radio and newspapers were the world&#x27;s media for accessing news and entertainment; now, all three media have converged into one, and people all over the world can read and hear news and other information on the Internet. The convergence of the Internet and conventional TV became popular in the 2010s, through Smart TV, also sometimes referred to as &quot;Connected TV&quot; or &quot;Hybrid TV&quot;, (not to be confused with IPTV, Internet TV, or with Web TV). Smart TV is used to describe the current trend of integration of the Internet and Web 2.0 features into modern television sets and set-top boxes, as well as the technological convergence between computers and these television sets or set-top boxes. These new devices most often also have a much higher focus on online interactive media, Internet TV, over-the-top content, as well as on-demand streaming media, and less focus on traditional broadcast media like previous generations of television sets and set-top boxes always have had.

==== Social movements ====
The integration of social movements in cyberspace is one of the potential strategies that social movements can use in the age of media convergence. Because of the neutrality of the Internet and the end-to-end design, the power structure of the Internet was designed to avoid discrimination between applications. Mexico&#x27;s Zapatistas campaign for land rights was one of the most influential case in the information age; Manuel Castells defines the Zapatistas as &quot;the first informational guerrilla movement&quot;. The Zapatista uprising had been marginalized by the popular press. The Zapatistas were able to construct a grassroots, decentralized social movement by using the Internet. The Zapatistas Effect, observed by Cleaver, continues to organize social movements on a global scale. A sophisticated webmetric analysis, which maps the links between different websites and seeks to identify important nodal points in a network, demonstrates that the Zapatistas cause binds together hundreds of global NGOs. The majority of the social movement organized by Zapatistas targets their campaign especially against global neoliberalism. A successful social movement not only need online support but also protest on the street. Papic wrote, &quot;Social Media Alone Do Not Instigate Revolutions&quot;, which discusses how the use of social media in social movements needs good organization both online and offline.

==Media==
&quot;Media technological convergence&quot; is the tendency that as technology changes, different technological systems sometimes evolve toward performing similar tasks. It is the interlinking of computing and other information technologies, media content, media companies and communication networks that have arisen as the result of the evolution and popularization of the Internet as well as the activities, products and services that have emerged in the digital media space.

Generally, media convergence refers to the merging of both old and new media and can be seen as a product, a system or a process. Jenkins states that convergence is, &quot;the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behaviour of media audiences who would go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they wanted&quot;. According to Jenkins, there are five areas of convergence: technological, economic, social or organic, cultural, and global. Media convergence is not just a technological shift or a technological process, it also includes shifts within the industrial, cultural, and social paradigms that encourage the consumer to seek out new information. Convergence, simply put, is how individual consumers interact with others on a social level and use various media platforms to create new experiences, new forms of media and content that connect us socially, and not just to other consumers, but to the corporate producers of media in ways that have not been as readily accessible in the past. However, Lugmayr and Dal Zotto argued, that media convergence takes place on technology, content, consumer, business model, and management level. They argue that media convergence is a matter of evolution and can be described through the triadic phenomena of convergence, divergence, and coexistence. Today&#x27;s digital media ecosystems coexist, as e.g., mobile app stores provide vendor lock-ins into particular eco-systems; some technology platforms are converging under one technology, due to, for example, the usage of common communication protocols as in digital TV; and other media are diverging, as, for example, media content offerings are more and more specializing and provides a space for niche media.

Closely linked to the multilevel process of media convergence are also several developments in different areas of the media and communication sector which are also summarized under the term of media deconvergence. Many experts view this as simply being the tip of the iceberg, as all facets of institutional activity and social life such as business, government, art, journalism, health, and education, are increasingly being carried out in these digital media spaces across a growing network of information and communication technology devices. Also included in this topic is the basis of computer networks, wherein many different operating systems are able to communicate via different protocols.
Convergent services, such as VoIP, IPTV, Smart TV, and others, tend to replace the older technologies and thus can disrupt markets. IP-based convergence is inevitable and will result in new service and new demand in the market. When the old technology converges into the public-owned common, IP based services become access-independent or less dependent. The old service is access-dependent.

Advances in technology bring the ability for technological convergence that Rheingold believes can alter the &quot;social-side effects,&quot; in that &quot;the virtual, social and physical world are colliding, merging and coordinating.&quot; It was predicted in the late 1980s, around the time that CD-ROM was becoming commonplace, that a digital revolution would take place, and that old media would be pushed to one side by new media. Broadcasting is increasingly being replaced by the Internet, enabling consumers all over the world the freedom to access their preferred media content more easily and at a more available rate than ever before.

However, when the dot-com bubble of the 1990s suddenly popped, that poured cold water over the talk of such a digital revolution. In today&#x27;s society, the idea of media convergence has once again emerged as a key point of reference as newer as well as established media companies attempt to visualize the future of the entertainment industry. If this revolutionary digital paradigm shift presumed that old media would be increasingly replaced by new media, the convergence paradigm that is currently emerging suggests that new and old media would interact in more complex ways than previously predicted. The paradigm shift that followed the digital revolution assumed that new media was going to change everything. When the dot com market crashed, there was a tendency to imagine that nothing had changed. The real truth lay somewhere in between as there were so many aspects of the current media environment to take into consideration. Many industry leaders are increasingly reverting to media convergence as a way of making sense in an era of disorientating change. In that respect, media convergence in theory is essentially an old concept taking on a new meaning. Media convergence, in reality, is more than just a shift in technology. It alters relationships between industries, technologies, audiences, genres and markets. Media convergence changes the rationality media industries operate in, and the way that media consumers process news and entertainment. Media convergence is essentially a process and not an outcome, so no single black box controls the flow of media. With proliferation of different media channels and increasing portability of new telecommunications and computing technologies, we have entered into an era where media constantly surrounds us.

Media convergence requires that media companies rethink existing assumptions about media from the consumer&#x27;s point of view, as these affect marketing and programming decisions. Media producers must respond to newly empowered consumers. Conversely, it would seem that hardware is instead diverging whilst media content is converging. Media has developed into brands that can offer content in a number of forms. Two examples of this are &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Both are films, but are also books, video games, cartoons, and action figures. Branding encourages expansion of one concept, rather than the creation of new ideas. In contrast, hardware has diversified to accommodate media convergence. Hardware must be specific to each function. While most scholars argue that the flow of cross-media is accelerating, O&#x27;Donnell suggests, especially between films and video game, the semblance of media convergence is misunderstood by people outside of the media production industry. The conglomeration of media industry continues to sell the same story line in different media. For example, Batman is in comics, films, anime, and games. However, the data to create the image of batman in each media is created individually by different teams of creators. The same character and the same visual effect repetitively appear in different media is because of the synergy of media industry to make them similar as possible. In addition, convergence does not happen when the game of two different consoles is produced. No flows between two consoles because it is faster to create game from scratch for the industry.

One of the more interesting new media journalism forms is virtual reality. Reuters, a major international news service, has created and staffed a news &quot;island&quot; in the popular online virtual reality environment &quot;Second Life&quot;. Open to anyone, &quot;Second Life&quot; has emerged as a compelling 3D virtual reality for millions of citizens around the world who have created avatars (virtual representations of themselves) to populate and live in an altered state where personal flight is a reality, altered egos can flourish, and real money ( were spent during the 24 hours concluding at 10:19 a.m. eastern time January 7, 2008) can be made without ever setting foot into the real world. The Reuters Island in &quot;Second Life&quot; is a virtual version of the Reuters real-world news service but covering the domain of &quot;Second Life&quot; for the citizens of &quot;Second Life&quot; (numbering 11,807,742 residents as of January 5, 2008).

Media convergence in the digital era means the changes that are taking place with older forms of media and media companies. Media convergence has two roles, the first is the technological merging of different media channels – for example, magazines, radio programs, TV shows, and movies, now are available on the Internet through laptops, iPads, and smartphones. As discussed in &quot;Media Culture&quot; (by Campbell), convergence of technology is not new. It has been going on since the late 1920s. An example is RCA, the Radio Corporation of America, which purchased Victor Talking Machine Company and introduced machines that could receive radio and play recorded music. Next came the TV, and radio lost some of its appeal as people started watching television, which has both talking and music as well as visuals. As technology advances, convergence of media change to keep up. The second definition of media convergence Campbell discusses is cross-platform by media companies. This usually involves consolidating various media holdings, such as cable, phone, television (over the air, satellite, cable) and Internet access under one corporate umbrella. This is not for the consumer to have more media choices, this is for the benefit of the company to cut down on costs and maximize its profits. As stated in the article &quot;Convergence Culture and Media Work&quot; by Mark Deuze, &quot;the convergence of production and consumption of media across companies, channels, genres, and technologies is an expression of the convergence of all aspects of everyday life: work and play, the local and the global, self and social identity.&quot;

=== History ===
Communication networks were designed to carry different types of information independently. The older media, such as television and radio, are broadcasting networks with passive audiences. Convergence of telecommunication technology permits the manipulation of all forms of information, voice, data, and video. Telecommunication has changed from a world of scarcity to one of seemingly limitless capacity. Consequently, the possibility of audience interactivity morphs the passive audience into an engaged audience. The historical roots of convergence can be traced back to the emergence of mobile telephony and the Internet, although the term properly applies only from the point in marketing history when fixed and mobile telephony began to be offered by operators as joined products. Fixed and mobile operators were, for most of the 1990s, independent companies. Even when the same organization marketed both products, these were sold and serviced independently.

In the 1990s, an implicit and often explicit assumption was that new media was going to replace the old media and Internet was going to replace broadcasting. In Nicholas Negroponte&#x27;s &quot;Being Digital&quot;, Negroponte predicts the collapse of broadcast networks in favor of an era of narrow-casting. He also suggests that no government regulation can shatter the media conglomerate. &quot;The monolithic empires of mass media are dissolving into an array of cottage industries... Media barons of today will be grasping to hold onto their centralized empires tomorrow... The combined forces of technology and human nature will ultimately take a stronger hand in plurality than any laws Congress can invent.&quot; The new media companies claimed that the old media would be absorbed fully and completely into the orbit of the emerging technologies. George Gilder dismisses such claims saying, &quot;The computer industry is converging with the television industry in the same sense that the automobile converged with the horse, the TV converged with the nickelodeon, the word-processing program converged with the typewriter, the CAD program converged with the drafting board, and digital desktop publishing converged with the Linotype machine and the letterpress.&quot; Gilder believes that computers had come not to transform mass culture but to destroy it.

Media companies put media convergence back to their agenda after the dot-com bubble burst. In 1994, Knight Ridder promulgated the concept of portable magazines, newspaper, and books: &quot;Within news corporations it became increasingly obvious that an editorial model based on mere replication in the Internet of contents that had previously been written for print newspapers, radio, or television was no longer sufficient.&quot; The rise of digital communication in the late 20th century has made it possible for media organizations (or individuals) to deliver text, audio, and video material over the same wired, wireless, or fiber-optic connections. At the same time, it inspired some media organizations to explore multimedia delivery of information. This digital convergence of news media, in particular, was called &quot;Mediamorphosis&quot; by researcher Roger Fidler in his 1997 book by that name. Today, we are surrounded by a multi-level convergent media world where all modes of communication and information are continually reforming to adapt to the enduring demands of technologies, &quot;changing the way we create, consume, learn and interact with each other&quot;.

=== Convergence culture ===

Henry Jenkins determines convergence culture to be the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behavior of media audiences who will go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they want. The convergence culture is an important factor in transmedia storytelling. Convergence culture introduces new stories and arguments from one form of media into many. Transmedia storytelling is defined by Jenkins as a process &quot;where integral elements of a fiction get dispersed systematically across multiple delivery channels for the purpose of creating a unified and coordinated entertainment experience. Ideally, each medium makes its own unique contribution to the unfolding of the story&quot;. For instance, &quot;The Matrix&quot; starts as a film, which is followed by two other instalments, but in a convergence culture it is not constrained to that form. It becomes a story not only told in the movies but in animated shorts, video games and comic books, three different media platforms. Online, a wiki is created to keep track of the story&#x27;s expanding canon. Fan films, discussion forums, and social media pages also form, expanding The Matrix to different online platforms. Convergence culture took what started as a film and expanded it across almost every type of media. Bert is Evil (images) Bert and Bin Laden appeared in CNN coverage of anti-American protest following September 11. The association of Bert and Bin Laden links back to the Ignacio&#x27;s Photoshop project for fun.

Convergence culture is a part of participatory culture. Because average people can now access their interests on many types of media they can also have more of a say. Fans and consumers are able to participate in the creation and circulation of new content. Some companies take advantage of this and search for feedback from their customers through social media and sharing sites such as YouTube. Besides marketing and entertainment, convergence culture has also affected the way we interact with news and information. We can access news on multiple levels of media from the radio, TV, newspapers, and the Internet. The Internet allows more people to be able to report the news through independent broadcasts and therefore allows a multitude of perspectives to be put forward and accessed by people in many different areas. Convergence allows news to be gathered on a much larger scale. For instance, photographs were taken of torture at Abu Ghraib. These photos were shared and eventually posted on the Internet. This led to the breaking of a news story in newspapers, on TV, and the Internet.

Media scholar Henry Jenkins has described the media convergence with participatory culture as:

=== Appliances ===
Some media observers expect that we will eventually access all media content through one device, or &quot;black box&quot;. As such, media business practice has been to identify the next &quot;black box&quot; to invest in and provide media for. This has caused a number of problems. Firstly, as &quot;black boxes&quot; are invented and abandoned, the individual is left with numerous devices that can perform the same task, rather than one dedicated for each task. For example, one may own both a computer and a video games console, subsequently owning two DVD players. This is contrary to the streamlined goal of the &quot;black box&quot; theory, and instead creates clutter. Secondly, technological convergence tends to be experimental in nature. This has led to consumers owning technologies with additional functions that are harder, if not impractical, to use rather than one specific device. Many people would only watch the TV for the duration of the meal&#x27;s cooking time, or whilst in the kitchen, but would not use the microwave as the household TV. These examples show that in many cases technological convergence is unnecessary or unneeded.

Furthermore, although consumers primarily use a specialized media device for their needs, other &quot;black box&quot; devices that perform the same task can be used to suit their current situation. As a 2002 Cheskin Research report explained: &quot;...Your email needs and expectations are different whether you&#x27;re at home, work, school, commuting, the airport, etc., and these different devices are designed to suit your needs for accessing content depending on where you are- your situated context.&quot; Despite the creation of &quot;black boxes&quot;, intended to perform all tasks, the trend is to use devices that can suit the consumer&#x27;s physical position. Due to the variable utility of portable technology, convergence occurs in high-end mobile devices. They incorporate multimedia services, GPS, Internet access, and mobile telephony into a single device, heralding the rise of what has been termed the &quot;smartphone,&quot; a device designed to remove the need to carry multiple devices. Convergence of media occurs when multiple products come together to form one product with the advantages of all of them, also known as the black box. This idea of one technology, concocted by Henry Jenkins, has become known more as a fallacy because of the inability to actually put all technical pieces into one. For example, while people can have email and Internet on their phone, they still want full computers with Internet and email in addition. Mobile phones are a good example, in that they incorporate digital cameras, MP3 players, voice recorders, and other devices. For the consumer, it means more features in less space; for media conglomerates it means remaining competitive.

However, convergence has a downside. Particularly in initial forms, converged devices are frequently less functional and reliable than their component parts (e.g., a mobile phone&#x27;s web browser may not render some web pages correctly, due to not supporting certain rendering methods, such as the iPhone browser not supporting Flash content). As the number of functions in a single device escalates, the ability of that device to serve its original function decreases. As Rheingold asserts, technological convergence holds immense potential for the &quot;improvement of life and liberty in some ways and (could) degrade it in others&quot;. He believes the same technology has the potential to be &quot;used as both a weapon of social control and a means of resistance&quot;. Since technology has evolved in the past ten years or so, companies are beginning to converge technologies to create demand for new products. This includes phone companies integrating 3G and 4G on their phones. In the mid 20th century, television converged the technologies of movies and radio, and television is now being converged with the mobile phone industry and the Internet. Phone calls are also being made with the use of personal computers. Converging technologies combine multiple technologies into one. Newer mobile phones feature cameras, and can hold images, videos, music, and other media. Manufacturers now integrate more advanced features, such as video recording, GPS receivers, data storage, and security mechanisms into the traditional cellphone.

== Telecommunications ==

&quot;Telecommunications convergence&quot; or &quot;network convergence&quot; describes emerging telecommunications technologies, and network architecture used to migrate multiple communications services into a single network. Specifically, this involves the converging of previously distinct media such as telephony and data communications into common interfaces on single devices, such as most smart phones can make phone calls and search the web.

=== Messaging ===
Combination services include those that integrate SMS with voice, such as voice SMS. Providers include Bubble Motion, Jott, Kirusa, and SpinVox. Several operators have launched services that combine SMS with mobile instant messaging (MIM) and presence. Text-to-landline services also exist, where subscribers can send text messages to any landline phone and are charged at standard rates. The text messages are converted into spoken language. This service has been popular in America, where fixed and mobile numbers are similar. Inbound SMS has been converging to enable reception of different formats (SMS, voice, MMS, etc.). In April 2008, O2 UK launched voice-enabled shortcodes, adding voice functionality to the five-digit codes already used for SMS. This type of convergence is helpful for media companies, broadcasters, enterprises, call centres and help desks who need to develop a consistent contact strategy with the consumer. Because SMS is very popular today, it became relevant to include text messaging as a contact possibility for consumers. To avoid having multiple numbers (one for voice calls, another one for SMS), a simple way is to merge the reception of both formats under one number. This means that a consumer can text or call one number and be sure that the message will be received.

=== Mobile ===
&quot;Mobile service provisions&quot; refers not only to the ability to purchase mobile phone services, but the ability to wirelessly access everything: voice, Internet, audio, and video. Advancements in WiMAX and other leading edge technologies provide the ability to transfer information over a wireless link at a variety of speeds, distances, and non-line-of-sight conditions.

=== Multi-play ===
Multi-play is a marketing term describing the provision of different telecommunication services, such as Internet access, television, telephone, and mobile phone service, by organizations that traditionally only offered one or two of these services. Multi-play is a catch-all phrase; usually, the terms triple play (voice, video and data) or quadruple play (voice, video, data and wireless) are used to describe a more specific meaning. A dual play service is a marketing term for the provisioning of the two services: it can be high-speed Internet (digital subscriber line) and telephone service over a single broadband connection in the case of phone companies, or high-speed Internet (cable modem) and TV service over a single broadband connection in the case of cable TV companies. The convergence can also concern the underlying communication infrastructure. An example of this is a triple play service, where communication services are packaged allowing consumers to purchase TV, Internet, and telephony in one subscription. The broadband cable market is transforming as pay-TV providers move aggressively into what was once considered the telco space. Meanwhile, customer expectations have risen as consumer and business customers alike seek rich content, multi-use devices, networked products and converged services including on-demand video, digital TV, high speed Internet, VoIP, and wireless applications. It is uncharted territory for most broadband companies.

A quadruple play service combines the triple play service of broadband Internet access, television, and telephone with wireless service provisions. This service set is also sometimes humorously referred to as &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; or &quot;Grand Slam&quot;. A fundamental aspect of the quadruple play is not only the long-awaited broadband convergence but also the players involved. Many of them, from the largest global service providers to whom we connect today via wires and cables to the smallest of startup service providers are interested. Opportunities are attractive: the big three telecom services – telephony, cable television, and wireless—could combine their industries. In the UK, the merger of NTL: Telewest and Virgin Mobile resulted in a company offering a quadruple play of cable television, broadband Internet, home telephone, and mobile telephone services.

=== Home network ===
Early in the 21st century, home LAN convergence so rapidly integrated home routers, wireless access points, and DSL modems that users were hard put to identify the resulting box they used to connect their computers to their Internet service. A general term for such a combined device is a residential gateway.

===VoIP===
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has not been able to decide how to regulate VoIP (Internet Telephony) because the convergent technology is still growing and changing. In addition to its growth, FCC is tentative to set regulation on VoIP in order to promote competition in the telecommunication industry. There is not a clear line between telecommunication service and the information service because of the growth of the new convergent media. Historically, telecommunication is subject to state regulation. The state of California concerned about the increasing popularity of Internet telephony will eventually obliterate funding for the Universal Service Fund. Some states attempt to assert their traditional role of common carrier oversight onto this new technology. Meisel and Needles (2005) suggests that the FCC, federal courts, and state regulatory bodies on access line charges will directly impact the speed in which Internet telephony market grows. On one hand, the FCC is hesitant to regulate convergent technology because VoIP with different feature from the old Telecommunication; no fixed model to build legislature yet. On the other hand, the regulations is needed because Service over the Internet might be quickly replaced telecommunication service, which will affect the entire economy.

Convergence has also raised several debates about classification of certain telecommunications services. As the lines between data transmission, and voice and media transmission are eroded, regulators are faced with the task of how best to classify the converging segments of the telecommunication sector. Traditionally, telecommunication regulation has focused on the operation of physical infrastructure, networks, and access to network. No content is regulated in the telecommunication because the content is considered private. In contrast, film and Television are regulated by contents. The rating system regulates its distribution to the audience. Self-regulation is promoted by the industry. Bogle senior persuaded the entire industry to pay 0.1 percent levy on all advertising and the money was used to give authority to the Advertising Standards Authority, which keeps the government away from setting legislature in the media industry.

The premises to regulate the new media, two-ways communications, concerns much about the change from old media to new media. Each medium has different features and characteristics. First, Internet, the new medium, manipulates all form of information – voice, data and video. Second, the old regulation on the old media, such as radio and Television, emphasized its regulation on the scarcity of the channels. Internet, on the other hand, has the limitless capacity, due to the end-to-end design. Third, Two-ways communication encourages interactivity between the content producers and the audiences.
&quot;...Fundamental basis for classification, therefore, is to consider the need for regulation in terms of either market failure or in the public interests&quot;(Blackman). The Electronic Frontier Foundation, founded in 1990, is a non profit organization that defends free speech, privacy, innovation, and consumer rights. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act regulates and protect the digital content producers and consumers.

===Trends===
Network neutrality is an issue. Wu and Lessig set out two reasons for network neutrality: firstly, by removing the risk of future discrimination, it incentivizes people to invest more in the development of broadband applications; secondly, it enables fair competition between applications without network bias. The two reasons also coincide with FCC&#x27;s interest to stimulate investment and enhance innovation in broadband technology and services. Despite regulatory efforts of deregulation, privatization, and liberalization, the infrastructure barrier has been a negative factor in achieving effective competition. Kim et al. argues that IP dissociates the telephony application from the infrastructure and Internet telephony is at the forefront of such dissociation. The neutrality of the network is very important for fair competition. As the former FCC Charman Michael Copps put it: &quot;From its inception, the Internet was designed, as those present during the course of its creating will tell you, to prevent government or a corporation or anyone else from controlling it. It was designed to defeat discrimination against users, ideas and technologies&quot;. Because of these reasons, Shin concludes that regulator should make sure to regulate application and infrastructure separately.

The layered model was first proposed by Solum and Chug, Sicker, and Nakahata. Sicker, Warbach and Witt have supported using a layered model to regulate the telecommunications industry with the emergence of convergence services. Many researchers have different layered approach, but they all agree that the emergence of convergent technology will create challenges and ambiguities for regulations. The key point of the layered model is that it reflects the reality of network architecture, and current business model. The layered model consists of:

# Access layer – where the physical infrastructure resides: copper wires, cable, or fiber optic.
# Transport layer – the provider of service.
# Application layer – the interface between the data and the users.
# Content layer – the layer which users see.

Shin combines the layered model and network neutrality as the principle to regulate the convergent media industry.

Medical applications of robotics have become increasingly prominent in the robotics literature.

The &quot;use&quot; of robots in service sectors is much less than the use of robots in manufacturing.
