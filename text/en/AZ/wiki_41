<text>Operation Tailwind was a covert incursion by a small unit of United States Army and allied Montagnard forces into southeastern Laos during the Vietnam War, conducted from 11 to 14 September 1970. Its purpose was to create a diversion for a Royal Lao Army offensive and to exert pressure on the occupation forces of the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN). A company-sized element of US Army Special Forces and Montagnard commando (Hatchet Force) of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (MACV-SOG or SOG) conducted the operation.

Nearly 30 years later, CNN/&quot;Time magazine&quot; jointly developed an investigative report that was both broadcast and published in June 1998 about Operation Tailwind. The TV segment was produced by April Oliver, Jack Smith, Pam Hill, and others. It was narrated by Peter Arnett, noted for war reporting, who had received a 1966 Pulitzer Prize for his work from Vietnam and who had worked with CNN for 18 years.

Entitled &quot;Valley of Death,&quot; the report claimed that US air support had used sarin nerve agent against opponents, and that other war crimes had been committed by US forces during Tailwind. In response the Pentagon conducted an investigation, as did CNN; the news organizations together ultimately retracted the report, and fired the producers responsible. April Oliver and Jack Smith sued CNN in a challenge of their dismissals and reached separate settlements with the network. After being reprimanded by CNN, Arnett resigned from the organization.

Several individuals who were sources for the reports, whose images were shown in the reports, or who were otherwise identified with the reports, brought other legal actions against CNN and Time Warner. A decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in one of the cases states that the Tailwind reports did not defame the plaintiff who was a source for the reports. It noted that the plaintiff, in his interviews with CNN, &quot;admitted the truth of each of the three facts he now challenges.&quot;

== Operation ==

During late 1970 the overall US-supported military effort in the covert war in the Kingdom of Laos was floundering. Operation Gauntlet, a multi-battalion Royal Lao Army offensive intended to protect Paksong and the strategic Bolovens Plateau, was failing. They appealed to headquarters of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam – Studies and Observations Group (MACV-SOG or SOG) in Saigon requesting aid from the highly classified unit; specifically, they asked for a unit to enter near Chavane and disrupt PAVN defenses. Colonel John Sadler, SOG&#x27;s commander, agreed to undertake the mission. However, none of his cross-border reconnaissance teams had ever operated so deep in Laos, and the target area was 20 miles (30 km) beyond the unit&#x27;s authorized area of operations.

The mission was launched by three platoons of Command and Control Central&#x27;s (Kontum) Hatchet Company B and two United States Air Force Pathfinder Teams. The 110 Montagnards and 16 Americans, under the command of Captain Eugene McCarley, were heli-lifted from a launch site at Dak To to a landing zone (LZ) in a valley to the west, near Chavane. The distance to the target was so great that the men were lifted by three United States Marine Corps (USMC) Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters from HMH-463, escorted by 12 USMC and Army Bell AH-1 Cobra gunships.

On the morning of the third day, the Americans overran a PAVN bivouac and killed 54 troops. They questioned why the Vietnamese had not fled the area, but members of the Hatchet Force discovered a bunker buried beneath of earth. Inside they found a huge cache of PAVN maps and documents. They had overrun the PAVN logistical headquarters that controlled all of Laotian Route 165. The forces quickly filled two footlockers with the intelligence haul and the Hatchet Force began to seek a way out. The PAVN were closing in, but McCarley dropped off elements at three separate (and smaller) landing zones, catching the PAVN unprepared.

Casualties incurred during the operation amounted to three Montagnards killed in action and 33 wounded, while all 16 Americans were wounded. Two CH-53s were shot down during the operation. The efforts of SOG medic Sergeant Gary Michael Rose were considered critical to the survival of many of the Hatchet Force. He was recommended for the Medal of Honor for his actions. He instead received the Distinguished Service Cross. This was later upgraded to the Medal of Honor, which President Donald Trump presented to him on October 23, 2017.

== &quot;Valley of Death&quot; ==
In 1998 Cable News Network (CNN) launched &quot;NewsStand CNN &amp; Time&quot;, a collaboration with Time magazine on reporting to be both broadcast and published in print form. On 7 June 1998 a report about Operation Tailwind, entitled &quot;Valley of Death&quot;, was broadcast as the premiere episode of the new program.

The segment analyzed and criticized Operation Tailwind. It alleged that US aircraft, in an unprecedented reversal of policy and breach of international treaties, had used sarin (&quot;GB&quot; in US/NATO nomenclature) against North Vietnamese ground troops who were attacking the landing zones during the extraction of the forces. The Pentagon did not dispute that some chemical agent was used, nor that both North Vietnamese and American soldiers struggled against its effects. However, most witnesses, sworn and unsworn, said that only a potent tear gas (most likely a CN/CS mixture) was used. According to reporting, others insisted it was sarin, or a combination of tear gas and sarin.

A second element of the reporting was an allegation that Operation Tailwind had been devised to eliminate a group of Americans who had defected to the enemy and were holed up in a Laotian village. According to the report, the nerve agent had been sprayed from aircraft twice: once to prep the village and once during extraction of troops. The report claimed that more than 100 Laotian men, women, and children had been killed during the attack on the village.

The broadcast (and the published &quot;Time&quot; magazine article of June 15) appeared to be reliably sourced. Admiral Thomas Moorer, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time of Tailwind, appeared to say that nerve agents had been used, and not just during this operation. However, Admiral Moorer later told investigators that he &quot;never confirmed anything&quot; to CNN regarding Operation Tailwind, that he had no knowledge of the use of sarin or the targeting of defectors, and he believed that producer April Oliver had asked him &quot;trick&quot; questions. But later again, in sworn deposition testimony taken during the suit of one of the producers, Admiral Moorer reviewed April Oliver&#x27;s notes of her interviews of him, including his responses to her questions. He did not make any significant objections to their accuracy.

Former SOG Lieutenant Robert Van Buskirk (one of the three platoon leaders) and three of the participating SOG sergeants allegedly gave information that supported the allegations as presented in the televised and published investigative report. Van Buskirk said that the Montagnard Hatchet Force was exposed on the landing zone (&quot;LZ&quot;) when the teargas agent was deployed to drive the enemy back. He also said that he saw his men (who were not equipped with gas masks) convulsing when the wind blew the agent back upon the LZ.

The CNN/Time reports suggested that war crimes had been committed. The Pentagon launched its own investigation.

=== Aftermath ===
CNN and &quot;Time&quot; magazine undertook an internal investigation. New York attorney Floyd Abrams, a constitutional lawyer, was hired to conduct the investigation for them. They jointly concluded that the journalism of the report was &quot;flawed,&quot; and the report should be publicly retracted, with apologies made to persons and institutions cited in it. The two key CNN producers of the report, April Oliver and Jack Smith, were fired outright when they refused to resign. Senior producer Pam Hill of CNN resigned. Reporter Peter Arnett was reprimanded and soon resigned, going to work for HDNet and then NBC.

Abrams later said that he had urged CNN/Time Warner to retract the report, but to acknowledge that it may have had truth to it. He said, retraction &quot;doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that the story isn&#x27;t true. … Who knows? Someday we might find other information. And, you know, maybe someday I&#x27;ll be back here again, having done another report saying that, &#x27;You know what? It was all true.&#x27;&quot;

In early July 1998, Tom Johnson, CNN News Group Chairman, President and CEO, issued a statement about the findings of the internal investigation. He pledged acceptance of the findings and reiterated that the allegations in &quot;Valley of Death&quot; and related reports &quot;cannot be supported.&quot; He said there was insufficient evidence that sarin or any other deadly gas was used, nor could CNN confirm that American deserters were targeted, or whether they were at the camp in Laos.

As a supplement to CNN&#x27;s retraction, on July 2 and July 5, 1998, the company aired retraction broadcasts that sought to portray some of the sources for the Tailwind reports as unreliable.

Oliver and Smith were chastised but unrepentant. They put together a 77-page document supporting their side of the story; it included testimony from military personnel apparently confirming the use of sarin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rebuttal to the Abrams/Kohler Report&quot;&gt;“TAILWIND” Rebuttal to the Abrams/Kohler Report Oliver, Smith (July 22, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Active and retired military personnel consulted by the media, including CNN&#x27;s own military analyst, USAF Major General Perry Smith (ret), noted that a particularly strong, non-lethal formulation of &quot;CS&quot; teargas was used during &quot;Tailwind.&quot; But they said that it should not be confused with sarin, which is categorized as a weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations.

Several individuals who were sources for the reports, whose images were shown in the reports, or who were otherwise identified with the reports, brought other legal actions against CNN and Time Warner. These actions were combined by the Judicial Panel for Multidistrict Litigation and were assigned to the United States District Court in the Northern District of California. They became collectively known as the &quot;Operation Tailwind&quot; litigation.

CNN and Time Warner defended its reports from claims of defamation, and most of these actions were dismissed by the court. In none of these cases did the court find that the original Tailwind reports had defamed anyone.

A decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in one of the cases states that the Tailwind reports did not defame the plaintiff who was a source for the reports. It noted that the plaintiff, in his interviews with CNN, &quot;admitted the truth of each of the three facts he now challenges.&quot; The Ninth Circuit said that CNN may have subsequently defamed this source in its retraction broadcast&#x27;s statement seeking to portray the source as &quot;unreliable&quot;. The court concluded that the question of whether the source was defamed by CNN in that retraction broadcast &quot;merits further development&quot;, and the appeals court remanded &quot;this issue to the district court for further proceedings.&quot;

=== In popular culture ===
The HBO series &quot;The Newsroom&quot; featured a major storyline in its second season that explored the fictional ACN&#x27;s coverage of &quot;Operation Genoa&quot;. This was loosely based on CNN&#x27;s coverage of Tailwind.

<doc id="204174" wikidata="Q7556" url="?curid=204174" title="Anatidae">
<text>The Anatidae are the biological family of water birds that includes ducks, geese, and swans. The family has a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on all the world&#x27;s continents except Antarctica. These birds are adapted for swimming, floating on the water surface, and, in some cases, diving in at least shallow water. The family contains around 174 species in 43 genera (the magpie goose is no longer considered to be part of the Anatidae and is now placed in its own family, Anseranatidae).

They are generally herbivorous and are monogamous breeders. A number of species undertake annual migrations. A few species have been domesticated for agriculture, and many others are hunted for food and recreation. Five species have become extinct since 1600, and many more are threatened with extinction.

==Description and ecology==
The ducks, geese, and swans are small- to large-sized birds with a broad and elongated general body plan. Diving species vary from this in being rounder. Extant species range in size from the cotton pygmy goose, at as little as 26.5 cm (10.5 in) and 164 g (5.8 oz), to the trumpeter swan, at as much as 183 cm (6 ft) and 17.2 kg (38 lb). The largest anatid ever known is the extinct flightless &quot;Garganornis ballmanni&quot; at 22 kg (49 lb). The wings are short and pointed, and supported by strong wing muscles that generate rapid beats in flight. They typically have long necks, although this varies in degree between species. The legs are short, strong, and set far to the back of the body (more so in the more aquatic species), and have a leathery feel with a scaly texture. Combined with their body shape, this can make some species awkward on land, but they are stronger walkers than other marine and water birds such as grebes or petrels. They typically have webbed feet, though a few species such as the Nene have secondarily lost their webbing. The bills are made of soft keratin with a thin and sensitive layer of skin on top (which has a leathery feel when touched). For most species, the shape of the bill tends to be more flattened to a greater or lesser extent. These contain serrated lamellae which are particularly well defined in the filter-feeding species.

Their feathers are excellent at shedding water due to special oils. Many of the ducks display sexual dimorphism, with the males being more brightly coloured than the females (although the situation is reversed in species such as the paradise shelduck). The swans, geese, and whistling-ducks lack sexually dimorphic plumage. Anatids are vocal birds, producing a range of quacks, honks, squeaks, and trumpeting sounds, depending on species; the female often has a deeper voice than the male.

Anatids are generally herbivorous as adults, feeding on various water-plants, although some species also eat fish, molluscs, or aquatic arthropods. One group, the mergansers, are primarily piscivorous, and have serrated bills to help them catch fish. In a number of species, the young include a high proportion of invertebrates in their diets, but become purely herbivorous as adults.

==Breeding==
The anatids are generally seasonal and monogamous breeders. The level of monogamy varies within the family; many of the smaller ducks only maintain the bond for a single season and find a new partner the following year, whereas the larger swans, geese and some of the more territorial ducks maintain pair bonds over a number of years, and even for life in some species. However, forced extrapair copulation among anatids is common, occurring in 55 species in 17 genera.

Anatidae is a large proportion of the 3% of bird species to possess a penis, though they vary significantly in size, shape, and surface elaboration. Most species are adapted for copulation on the water only. They construct simple nests from whatever material is close at hand, often lining them with a layer of down plucked from the mother&#x27;s breast. In most species, only the female incubates the eggs. The young are precocial, and are able to feed themselves from birth. One aberrant species, the black-headed duck, is an obligate brood parasite, laying its eggs in the nests of gulls and coots. While this species never raises its own young, a number of other ducks occasionally lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics (members of the same species) in addition to raising their own broods.

==Relationship with humans==
Duck, eider, and goose feathers and down have long been popular for bedspreads, pillows, sleeping bags, and coats. The members of this family also have long been used for food.

Humans have had a long relationship with ducks, geese, and swans; they are important economically and culturally to humans, and several duck species have benefited from an association with people. However, some anatids are agricultural pests, and have acted as vectors for zoonoses such as avian influenza.

Since 1600, five species of ducks have become extinct due to the activities of humans, and subfossil remains have shown that humans caused numerous extinctions in prehistory. Today, many more are considered threatened. Most of the historic and prehistoric extinctions were insular species, vulnerable due to small populations (often endemic to a single island), and island tameness. Evolving on islands that lacked predators, these species lost antipredator behaviours, as well as the ability to fly, and were vulnerable to human hunting pressure and introduced species. Other extinctions and declines are attributable to overhunting, habitat loss and modification, and hybridisation with introduced ducks (for example the introduced ruddy duck swamping the white-headed duck in Europe). Numerous governments and conservation and hunting organisations have made considerable progress in protecting ducks and duck populations through habitat protection and creation, laws and protection, and captive-breeding programmes.

==Systematics==
===History of classification===
The name Anatidae for the family was introduced by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in a guide to the contents of the British Museum published in 1819. While the status of the Anatidae as a family is straightforward, and which species properly belong to it is little debated, the relationships of the different tribes and subfamilies within it are poorly understood. The listing in the box at right should be regarded as simply one of several possible ways of organising the many species within the Anatidae; see discussion in the next section.

The systematics of the Anatidae are in a state of flux. Previously divided into six subfamilies, a study of anatomical characters by Livezey suggests the Anatidae are better treated in nine subfamilies. This classification was popular in the late 1980s to 1990s. But mtDNA sequence analyses indicate, for example, the dabbling and diving ducks do not belong in the same subfamily.

While shortcomings certainly occur in Livezey&#x27;s analysis, mtDNA is an unreliable source for phylogenetic information in many waterfowl (especially dabbling ducks) due to their ability to produce fertile hybrids, in rare cases possibly even beyond the level of genus (see for example the &quot;Barbary duck&quot;). Because the sample size of many molecular studies available to date is small, mtDNA results must be considered with caution.

While a comprehensive review of the Anatidae which unites all evidence into a robust phylogeny is still lacking, the reasons for the confusing data are at least clear: As demonstrated by the Late Cretaceous fossil &quot;Vegavis iaai&quot;—an early modern waterbird which belonged to an extinct lineage—the Anatidae are an ancient group among the modern birds. Their earliest direct ancestors, though not documented by fossils yet, likewise can be assumed to have been contemporaries with the non-avian dinosaurs. The long period of evolution and shifts from one kind of waterbird lifestyle to another have obscured many plesiomorphies, while apparent apomorphies are quite often the result of parallel evolution, for example the &quot;non-diving duck&quot; type displayed by such unrelated genera as &quot;Dendrocygna&quot;, &quot;Amazonetta&quot;, and &quot;Cairina&quot;. For the fossil record, see below.

Alternatively, the Anatidae may be considered to consist of three subfamilies (ducks, geese, and swans, essentially) which contain the groups as presented here as tribes, with the swans separated as subfamily Cygninae, the goose subfamily Anserinae also containing the whistling ducks, and the Anatinae containing all other clades.

==Genera==
For the living and recently extinct members of each genus, see the article List of Anatidae species.

* Subfamily: Dendrocygninae (one pantropical genus, of distinctive long-legged goose-like birds)
** &quot;Dendrocygna&quot;, whistling ducks (8 living species)
** &quot;Thalassornis&quot;, white-backed duck 
* Subfamily: Anserinae, swans and geese (3–7 extant genera with 25–30 living species, mainly cool temperate Northern Hemisphere, but also some Southern Hemisphere species, with the swans in one genus [two genera in some treatments], and the geese in three genera [two genera in some treatments]. Some other species are sometimes placed herein, but seem somewhat more distinct [see below])
** &quot;Cygnus&quot;, true swans (6 species, 4 sometimes separated in &quot;Olor&quot;)
** &quot;Anser&quot;, grey geese and white geese (11 species)
** &quot;Branta&quot;, black geese (6 living species)
* Subfamily: Stictonettinae (one genus in Australia, formerly included in the Oxyurinae, but with anatomy suggesting a distinct ancient lineage perhaps closest to the Anserinae, especially the Cape Barren goose)
** &quot;Stictonetta&quot;, freckled duck
* Subfamily: Plectropterinae (one genus in Africa, formerly included in the &quot;perching ducks&quot;, but closer to the Tadorninae)
** &quot;Plectropterus&quot;, spur-winged goose
* Subfamily: Tadorninae – shelducks and sheldgeese (This group of larger, often semiterrestrial waterfowl can be seen as intermediate between Anserinae and Anatinae. The 1986 revision has resulted in the inclusion of 10 extant genera with about two-dozen living species [one probably extinct] in this subfamily, mostly from the Southern Hemisphere but a few in the Northern Hemisphere; the affiliations of several presumed tadornine genera has later been questioned and the group in the traditional lineup is likely to be paraphyletic.)
** &quot;Pachyanas&quot;, Chatham Island duck (prehistoric)
** &quot;Tadorna&quot;, shelducks (6 species, 1 probably extinct) – possibly paraphyletic
** &quot;Radjah&quot;, Radjah shelduck 
** &quot;Salvadorina&quot;, Salvadori&#x27;s teal
** &quot;Centrornis&quot;, Madagascar sheldgoose (prehistoric, tentatively placed here)
** &quot;Alopochen&quot;, Egyptian goose and Mascarene shelducks (1 living species, 2 extinct)
** &quot;Neochen&quot;, (2 species)
** &quot;Chloephaga&quot;, sheldgeese (4 species)
** &quot;Hymenolaimus&quot;, blue duck
** &quot;Merganetta&quot;, torrent duck

* Subfamily: Aythyinae, diving ducks (Some 15 species of diving ducks, of worldwide distribution, in two to four genera; The 1986 morphological analysis suggested the probably extinct pink-headed duck of India, previously treated separately in &quot;Rhodonessa&quot;, should be placed in &quot;Netta&quot;, but this has been questioned. Furthermore, while morphologically close to dabbling ducks, the mtDNA data indicate a treatment as distinct subfamily is indeed correct, with the Tadorninae being actually closer to dabbling ducks than the diving ducks)
** &quot;Netta&quot;, red-crested pochard and allies (4 species, 1 probably extinct)
** &quot;Aythya&quot;, pochards, scaups, etc. (12 species)
* Subfamily: Anatinae, dabbling ducks and moa-nalos (The dabbling duck group, of worldwide distribution, were previously restricted to just one or two genera, but had been extended to include eight extant genera and about 55 living species, including several genera formerly known as the &quot;perching ducks&quot;; mtDNA on the other hand confirms that the genus &quot;Anas&quot; is over-lumped and casts doubt on the diving duck affiliations of several genera [see below]. The moa-nalos, of which four species in three genera are known to date, are a peculiar group of flightless, extinct anatids from the Hawaiian Islands. Gigantic in size and with massive bills, they were believed to be geese, but have been shown to be actually very closely related to mallards. They evolved filling the ecological niche of turtles, ungulates, and other megaherbivores. 
** &quot;Anas&quot;: pintails, mallards, etc. (40–50 living species, 3 extinct)
** &quot;Chendytes&quot;, diving-geese (extinct c. 450–250 BCE, A basal member of the dabbling duck clade)
** &quot;Spatula&quot;, shovelers
** &quot;Mareca&quot;, wigeons and gadwalls
** &quot;Lophonetta&quot;, crested duck
** &quot;Speculanas&quot;, bronze-winged duck
** &quot;Amazonetta&quot;, Brazilian teal
** &quot;Sibirionetta&quot;, Baikal teal
** &quot;Chelychelynechen&quot;, turtle-jawed moa-nalo (prehistoric)
** &quot;Thambetochen&quot;, large-billed moa-nalos (2 species, prehistoric)
** &quot;Ptaiochen&quot;, small-billed moa-nalo (prehistoric)
* Tribe: Mergini, eiders, scoters, sawbills and other sea-ducks (There are 9 extant genera and some 20 living species; most of this group occur in the Northern Hemisphere, but a few [mostly extinct] mergansers in the Southern Hemisphere)
** &quot;Shiriyanetta&quot; (prehistoric)
** &quot;Polysticta&quot;, Steller&#x27;s eider
** &quot;Somateria&quot;, eiders (3 species)
** &quot;Histrionicus&quot;, harlequin duck (includes &quot;Ocyplonessa&quot;)
** &quot;Camptorhynchus&quot;, Labrador duck (extinct)
** &quot;Melanitta&quot;, scoters (6 species)
** &quot;Clangula&quot;, long-tailed duck (1 species)
** &quot;Bucephala&quot;, goldeneyes (3 species)
** &quot;Mergellus&quot;, smew
** &quot;Lophodytes&quot;, hooded merganser
** &quot;Mergus&quot;, mergansers (4 living species, 1 extinct).
* Tribe: Oxyurini, stiff-tail ducks (a small group of 3–4 genera, 2–3 of them monotypic, with 7–8 living species)
** &quot;Oxyura&quot;, stiff-tailed ducks (5 living species)
** &quot;Nomonyx&quot;, masked duck
** &quot;Heteronetta&quot;, black-headed duck
* Unresolved: The largest degree of uncertainty concerns whether a number of genera are closer to the shelducks or to the dabbling ducks. See also the monotypic subfamilies above, and the &quot;perching ducks&quot;
** &quot;Coscoroba&quot;, coscoroba swan – Anserinae or same subfamily as &quot;Cereopsis&quot;?
** &quot;Cereopsis&quot;, Cape Barren goose – Anserinae, Tadorninae, or own subfamily?
** &quot;Biziura&quot;, musk ducks (1 living species) - Oxyurini?
** &quot;Cnemiornis&quot;, New Zealand geese (prehistoric) – as &quot;Cereopsis&quot;
** &quot;Malacorhynchus&quot;, pink-eared ducks (1 living species) – Tadorninae, Oxyurinae or Dendrocheninae?
** &quot;Sarkidiornis&quot;, comb duck – Tadorninae or closer to dabbling ducks?
** &quot;Tachyeres&quot;, steamer ducks (4 species) – Tadorninae or closer to dabbling ducks?
** &quot;Cyanochen&quot;, blue-winged goose – Tadorninae or more distant clade?
** &quot;Nettapus&quot;, pygmy geese (3 species) – Anatinae or part of Southern Hemisphere radiation?
** &quot;Pteronetta&quot;, Hartlaub&#x27;s duck – traditionally dabbling ducks, but may be closer to &quot;Cyanochen&quot;
** &quot;Cairina&quot; and &quot;Asarcornis&quot;, Muscovy duck and white-winged duck, respectively (2 species) – traditionally dabbling ducks, but may be paraphyletic, with one species in Tadorninae and the other closer to diving ducks
** &quot;Aix&quot;, Mandarin duck and wood duck (2 species) – dabbling ducks or Tadorninae?
** &quot;Callonetta&quot;, ringed teal – dabbling ducks or Tadorninae?
** &quot;Chenonetta&quot;, maned duck (1 living species) – dabbling ducks or Tadorninae? Includes &quot;Euryanas&quot;.
** &quot;Marmaronetta&quot;, marbled duck – formerly dabbling ducks; actually a diving duck or a distinct subfamily

===Prehistoric species===

From subfossil bones found on Kauai (Hawaiian Islands), two enigmatic waterfowl are known. The living and assignable prehistoric avifauna of the archipelago contains as Anseriformes &quot;Branta&quot; geese and their descendants, and the moa-nalos as mentioned above. The following taxa, although certainly new species, cannot be assigned even to subfamily; that Kauai is the oldest of the large Hawaiian Islands, meaning the species may have been evolving in isolation for nearly 10 mya (since the Late Miocene), does not help in determining their affinities:
* Long-legged &quot;shelduck&quot;, Anatidae sp. et gen. indet.
* Kaua&#x27;i mole duck, &quot;Talpanas lippa&quot;

Similarly, &quot;Branta rhuax&quot; from the Big Island of Hawaii, and a gigantic goose-like anatid from Oahu are known only from very incomplete, and in the former case much damaged, bone fragments. The former has been alleged to be a shelduck, but this was generally dismissed because of the damage to the material and biogeographic considerations. The long-legged Kauai bird, however, hints at the possibility of a former tadornine presence on the archipelago.

===Fossil Anatidae===
The fossil record of anatids is extensive, but many prehistoric genera cannot be unequivocally assigned to present-day subfamilies for the reasons given above. For prehistoric species of extant genera, see the respective genus accounts.

The Middle Oligocene &quot;Limicorallus&quot; (from Chelkar-Teniz (Kazakhstan) was sometimes considered an anserine. It is now recognized as a primitive cormorant. The middle Eocene &quot;Eonessa&quot; was formerly thought to belong to Anatidae, however reexamination of the holotype in 1978 resulted in the genus being placed as Aves incertae sedis.

<text>As-salamu alaykum (, ), also written salamun alaykum and typically rendered in English as salam alaykum, is a greeting in Arabic that means &#x27;Peace be upon you&#x27;. The (, meaning &#x27;peace&#x27;) has become a religious salutation for Muslims worldwide when greeting each other, though its use as a greeting predates Islam, and is also common among Arabic speakers of other religions (such as Arab Christians and Mizrahi Jews).

In colloquial speech, often only , &#x27;peace&#x27;, is used to greet a person. This shorter greeting, (), has come to be used as the general salutation in other languages as well.

The typical response to the greeting is ( , &#x27;and peace be upon you&#x27;). In the Quranic period one repeated &quot;as-salamu alaykum&quot;, but the inverted response is attested in Arabic not long after its appearance in Hebrew. The phrase may also be expanded to ( , &#x27;Peace be upon you, as well as the mercy of God and His blessings&#x27;).

The use of &quot;salām&quot; as an Arabic greeting dates at least to Laqit bin Yamar al-Ayadi (6th century), and cognates in other Semitic languagesincluding Aramaic () and Hebrew ( )can be traced back to the Old Testament period.

==Pronunciation==
The phrase is normally pronounced according to local dialects of speakers and is very often shortened. For example, in Egypt, the phrase and its response are pronounced and .

==Grammatical variants==
The expression commonly uses the second person plural masculine, even when used to address one person. It may be modified by choosing the appropriate enclitic pronoun to address a person in the masculine and feminine singular form, the dual form, or the feminine plural form. The conjugations are as follows (note: according to the standard pronunciation rules of Classical Arabic, the last short vowel in each word is not pronounced in pausa):

A third-person variant, &quot;ʿalayhi as-salām&quot;, &quot;peace be upon him&quot;, is often used by Muslims for prophets other than Muhammad and other holy personalities, such as angels.

== In Islam ==

According to Islamic tradition, the origin of the greeting &quot;Peace be upon you&quot; dates back to the first human, Adam:

Abu Huraira reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, &quot;Allah said: Go and greet with peace these groups of assembled angels and listen to how they greet you, for this will be the greeting among your progeny. Adam said: Peace be upon you. The angels said: Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah. Thus, they added the mercy of Allah&quot; 

The final Prophet said, &quot;None of you will enter paradise until you believe and you will not believe until you love one another. Shall I not tell you about something which, if you do it, you will love one another? Spread salaam amongst yourselves.&quot;

It is also stated that one should give the Salam greeting upon entering a house. This is based upon a verse of the Quran: &quot;However, when you enter houses, greet one another with a greeting ˹of peace˺ from Allah, blessed and good. This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you, so perhaps you will understand.&quot; (An-Nur 24:61).

The phrase appears a total of 7 times in the Quran, each time as &quot;salamun ʿalaykum&quot; (). In Classical Arabic, used in the Qur&#x27;an and early Hadith manuscripts, the phrase is spelled as . In Rasm, it is written as .

* Surah Al-An&#x27;am (6), Ayah 54:

* Surah Al-A&#x27;raf (7), Ayah 46:

* Surah Ar-Ra&#x27;d (13), Ayah 24:

* Surah An-Nahl (16), Ayah 32:

*Surah Maryam (19), Ayah 47:

*Surah Al-Qasas (28), Ayah 55:

*Surah Az-Zumar (39), Ayah 73:
Other variants, such as &quot;salamun ʿalā&quot; (), or the term &quot;salam&quot; () alone is also mentioned in several other Ayahs of the Qur&#x27;an.

==Usage by non-Arabic speakers==
* Cognate Semitic language parallels include the Aramaic/Classical Syriac &quot;šlāmā ʿalḵōn&quot; (ܫܠܵܡܵܐ ܥܲܠܟ݂ܘܿܢ), and the Hebrew &quot;Shalom aleichem&quot; ( &quot;shālôm ʻalêḵem&quot;).
* In Iran, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan, &quot;Salâm&quot; () is used alone more frequently, with occasional use of &quot;Salam-o aleykom&quot; and the more common &quot;beh salâmat&quot; (), meaning &quot;[go] with peace&quot;. Goodbye is supplanted by a &quot;Khudâ hâfez&quot; (), meaning &quot;with the protection of God&quot;.
* In Albania and Kosovo, a diminutive form in the Albanian language, &quot;Selamun Alejkem&quot; or &quot;Selamun Alejqum&quot; is rarely used, the &#x27;q&#x27; being a voiceless palatal stop typical of Balkan Turkish and Thracian Turkish phonology. Similarly, Bosniaks and Macedonian Muslims use the phrase &quot;&quot; (Cyrillic: ).
* In Amharic, the native Amharic term &quot;Selam&quot; is used in place of &quot;Tadias&quot;, which is the equivalent of &quot;What&#x27;s up&quot;.
* In Turkey, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, many religious people use &quot;Äs-sälamwaleykum&quot; or and shake hands and it is the same for saying &quot;Hello&quot;; more secular and non-religious people say &quot;Selam&quot; and in Kazakhstan say &quot;Sälem&quot; or &quot;Sälemetsız be&quot; as an equivalent to &quot;Hello&quot; or &quot;Hi&quot;. However, many Turks pronounce it differently as &quot;Selamün aleyküm&quot;.
* In Pakistan, the greeting is also associated with shaking right hands and is also often accompanied with a hug when meeting infrequently (only between the same gender). In some places, people put a hand on their heart as they shake your hand and greet. Also, the full greeting (As-salamu alaykum) is preferred versus the shorter greeting of &quot;salam&quot; or &quot;salamu alaykum&quot;. Goodbye is supplanted by a &quot;Khuda Hafiz&quot; or the variation &quot;Allah Hafiz&quot;, both of which mean &quot;May God protect you&quot;.
* In India, the greeting mostly among Muslims is a simple handshake or hug, As-salamu alaykum () or the shorter greeting &quot;Salam&quot; is used in informal situations. Goodbye is supplanted by a &quot;Khuda Hafiz&quot; or the alternative form &quot;Allah Hafiz&quot; (), both of which mean &quot;May God protect you&quot;.
* In Bangladesh, Assalamu alaikum () is the most common Muslim greeting. Some Muslims greet their elders with these words whilst raising their right hand to the forehead. Assalamu alaikum is even used as to say goodbye, while many others say &quot;Khoda Hafez&quot; or &quot;Allah Hafez&quot; () &quot;May God protect you&quot;.
* In Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, Assalomu aleykum is used as an informal greeting.
* In Indonesia, the greeting is sometimes mixed with other greeting phrases of other religions. Informally, it is also often shortened into &quot;Samlekom&quot;, a recent phenomenon, but this usage sometimes comes into criticism.
* Shortening the greeting to acronyms, such as &quot;A.S.&quot;, &quot;As&#x27;kum&quot; (in Malaysia), or &quot;AsA&quot; is becoming common amongst Internet users in chat rooms and by people using SMS. This trend is similar to writing (S) or SAWS in place of &quot;ṣallā llāhu ʿalayhi wa-sallam&quot;.
* In Chechnya and other parts of the Caucasus, Salamun Alaykum () is used to say hello, in Ossetia, a corrupted version of Salam is used ().
* In Senegal which has a majority of Muslims with Tasawwuf-orientation, it is a common greeting. Spelled and pronounced in Wolof: &quot;a-sala māleykum&quot;, with the reply being &quot;må-lekum salām.&quot;
* In Xinjiang, China, &quot;Essalam eleykum&quot; is used as a greeting by Uyghurs, and the reply is &quot;We-eleykum essalam&quot;.
* In Portugal, the expression gained a totally distinct and curious meaning: due to the habit of Iberian Arabs to bow and wave their hand when greeting a person, the expression &quot;Salamaleque&quot; is applied to exaggerated movements or acts in order to appear to be formal, entertaining or fancy. For example: &quot;Os rapazes chegaram cheios de salamaleques&quot;.
* In Italy, &quot;Salamelecco&quot; has a similar meaning, referring to excessive courtesy and politeness.
* In France, &quot;salamalec&quot; has similar meaning, referring to excessive flattery.
*In Malta, is often used in Catholic Church masses as a way of greeting, often by the priest, as a way of saying &quot;peace be upon you&quot;. As the Maltese language derives from Arabic, it inherited and still uses Arabic terms for religion amongst other things.
*In the Maldives, &quot;&quot; (&quot;assalaam &#x27;alaikum&quot;) is used as a common formal greeting, used similar to &quot;hello&quot;.
*In Nigeria, the phrase &quot;assalamu alaikum&quot; is used as a formal greeting by Muslims.
*In Kurdish, the phrase &quot; is used as a formal greeting among, often shortened to just &quot;.
* In Russia, Muslims use variations of the phrase, such as &quot; (Russian), &quot; or &quot; (Chechen), &quot; (Bashkir), and &quot;&quot; (Tatar).

<doc id="204182" wikidata="Q21651" url="?curid=204182" title="Anseriformes">
<text>Anseriformes is an order of birds also known as waterfowl that comprises about 180 living species of birds in three families: Anhimidae (three species of screamers), Anseranatidae (the magpie goose), and Anatidae, the largest family, which includes over 170 species of waterfowl, among them the ducks, geese, and swans. Most modern species in the order are highly adapted for an aquatic existence at the water surface. With the exception of screamers, males have penises, a trait that has been lost in the Neoaves, the clade consisting of all other modern birds except the galliformes and paleognaths. Due to their aquatic nature, most species are web-footed.

==Evolution==
Anseriformes are one of only two types of modern bird to be confirmed present during the Mesozoic alongside the other dinosaurs, and in fact were among the very few birds to survive their extinction, along with their cousins, the Galliformes. These two groups only occupied two ecological niches during the Mesozoic, living in water and on the ground, while the toothed Enantiornithes were the dominant birds that ruled the trees and air. The asteroid that ended the Mesozoic destroyed all trees as well as animals in the open, a condition that took centuries to recover from. The Anseriformes and Galliformes are thought to have survived in the cover of burrows and water, and not to have needed trees for food and reproduction.

The earliest known stem anseriform is the presbyornithid &quot;Teviornis&quot; from the Nemegt Formation of Mongolia. Some members apparently surviving the KT extinction event, including presbyornithids, thought to be the common ancestors of ducks, geese, swans, and screamers, the last group once thought to be Galliformes, but now genetically confirmed to be closely related to geese. The first known duck fossils start to appear about 34 million years ago.

Waterfowl are the best-known examples of sexually antagonistic genital coevolution in vertebrates, causing genital adaptations to coevolve in each sex to advance control over mating and fertilization. Sexually antagonistic coevolution (or SAC) occurs as a consequence of sexual conflict between males and females, resulting in coevolutionary process that reduce fit, or that functions to decrease ease of having sex.

==Taxonomy==
The Anseriformes and the Galliformes (pheasants, etc.) belong to a common group, the Galloanserae. They are the most primitive neognathous birds, and as such they should follow the Palaeognathae (ratites and tinamous) in bird classification systems. Several unusual extinct families of birds like the albatross-like pseudotooth birds and the giant flightless gastornithids and mihirungs have been found to be stem-anseriforms based on common features found in the skull region, beak physiology and pelvic region. The genus &quot;Vegavis&quot; for a while was found to be the earliest member of the anseriform crown group but a recent 2017 paper has found it to be just outside the crown group in the family Vegaviidae. However, the monophyly of Vegaviidae was questioned by other researchers who described a nearly complete skull of &quot;Vegavis&quot; in 2025, supporting its placement within crown group Anseriformes.

Below is the general consensus (prior to Torres et al. (2025)) of the phylogeny of anseriforms and their stem relatives.
===Systematics===
Anatidae systematics, especially regarding placement of some &quot;odd&quot; genera in the dabbling ducks or shelducks, is not fully resolved. See the Anatidae article for more information, and for alternate taxonomic approaches. Anatidae is traditionally divided into subfamilies Anatinae and Anserinae. The Anatinae consists of tribes Anatini, Aythyini, Mergini and Tadornini. The higher-order classification below follows a phylogenetic analysis performed by Mikko&#x27;s Phylogeny Archive and John Boyd&#x27;s website.

In addition, a considerable number of mainly Late Cretaceous and Paleogene fossils have been described where it is uncertain whether or not they are anseriforms. This is because almost all orders of aquatic birds living today either originated or underwent a major radiation during that time, making it hard to decide whether some waterbird-like bone belongs into this family or is the product of parallel evolution in a different lineage due to adaptive pressures.

===Phylogeny===
Living Anseriformes based on the work by John Boyd.


==Molecular studies==

Studies of the mitochondrial DNA suggest the existence of four branches – Anseranatidae, Dendrocygninae, Anserinae and Anatinae – with Dendrocygninae being a subfamily within the family Anatidae and Anseranatidae representing an
independent family. The clade Somaterini has a single genus &quot;Somateria&quot;.

<text>Stephen Perry was a 19th-century British inventor and businessman credited with the invention of the rubber band. His corporation was the Messers Perry and Co. Rubber Manufacturers of London, which made early products from vulcanised rubber, only recently perfected by Charles Goodyear in 1839. On 17 March 1845, Perry received a patent for the rubber band.

Vulcanisation, a chemical process for converting polymers into more durable materials, gave the rubber a higher tensile strength, improved its resistance to abrasion and allowed the elastic to remain flexible and supple over a wider range of temperatures.

<text>Cyrus West Field (November 30, 1819July 12, 1892) was an American businessman and financier who, along with other entrepreneurs, created the Atlantic Telegraph Company and laid the first telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean in 1858.

==Early life==
Field was born in Stockbridge, Massachusetts to Rev. David Dudley Field, a Congregational clergyman, and Submit Dickinson Field, daughter of Revolutionary War Captain Noah Dickinson from Somers, Connecticut. The eighth of ten children, he was the brother of David Dudley Field Jr., Henry Martyn Field, and Stephen Johnson Field, the 38th United States Supreme Court Justice, among other siblings. When he was 15 years old, Field came to New York City, where he was hired as an errand boy in the A.T. Stewart &amp; Co., a dry goods merchant firm. He entered a business apprenticeship, and earned fifty dollars at his first year as a storeroom clerk; his pay was doubled the following year. After three years, he came back to Stockbridge, but returned to New York later in his career. Field married Mary Bryan Stone on December 2, 1840, two days after he turned twenty one, and they had seven children.

==Getting started in business==
Although Field had many available career options, he chose business. This was a great move for Field. At first, he worked for his brothers, David Dudley Field Jr. and Matthew Dickinson Field. In 1838, he accepted an offer from his brother Matthew to become his assistant in the paper manufacturing venture, the Columbia Mill, in Lee, Massachusetts. In Spring 1840, he went into business by himself, manufacturing paper in Westfield, Massachusetts. The same year, he became a junior partner in the E. Root &amp; Co., a wholesale paper firm based in New York with responsibilities to oversee clients and conduct sales away from New York. After six months, E. Root &amp; Co. failed leaving large debts. Field negotiated with creditors, dissolved the old firm, and started a new partnership with his brother-in-law, Joseph F. Stone, registered as Cyrus W. Field &amp; Co. He stayed in business and was furnishing supplies for the Northeast mills, such as owned by Crane &amp; Company, and buying the finished product wholesale. Through his hard work and long hours, the young paper merchant was able to repay the settled debts and succeed in business by servicing the burgeoning penny press and the need for stocks and bonds, becoming eventually one of the richest men in New York. In March, 1853, he repaid all previously cancelled debt due to insolvency of E. Root &amp; Co. debts in full amount with interest, being under no legal obligation to do so. Among the answers received, one particularly stated, 

==Midlife==

Business earnings permitted Field to partially retire at the age of 34 with a fortune of $250,000 and build a home in Gramercy Park. In 1853, Field financed an expedition to South America with his artist friend Frederic Edwin Church, during which they explored present-day Ecuador, Colombia, and Panama. They followed the route taken by Alexander von Humboldt over 50 years earlier. Church&#x27;s sketches of the landscapes and volcanoes on this trip, and on a subsequent trip in 1857 with artist Louis Rémy Mignot, inspired some of his most famous paintings upon his return to New York. Field&#x27;s list of &quot;Places of Interest to Visit&quot; in South America reflected his interests, including business interests: bridges, volcanoes, waterfalls, and cities, as well as gold mines and the emerald mines of Muzo. 

Field turned his attention to telegraphy after he was contacted in January 1854 by Frederic Newton Gisborne, a British engineer, who aimed to establish a telegraph connection between St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and New York City, started the work, but failed due to the lack of capital. Later that year he, with Peter Cooper, Abram Stevens Hewitt, Moses Taylor and Samuel F.B. Morse, joined the so-called &quot;Cable Cabinet&quot; of entrepreneurs, investors and engineers. Through this Cable Cabinet, Field became instrumental in laying a telegraph line connecting St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland with Nova Scotia, coupling with telegraph lines from the U.S. American investors took over Gisborne&#x27;s venture and formed a new company called the New York, Newfoundland, and London Telegraph Company (N.Y.N.L.T.C.) after Field convinced the Cable Cabinet to extend the line from Newfoundland to Ireland .

The next year the same investors formed the American Telegraph Company and began buying up other companies, rationalizing them into a consolidated system that ran from Maine to the Gulf Coast; the system was second only to Western Union&#x27;s.

In 1857, after securing financing in England and backing from the American and British governments, the Atlantic Telegraph Company began laying the first transatlantic telegraph cable, utilizing a shallow submarine plateau that ran between Ireland and Newfoundland. The cable was officially opened on August 16, 1858, when Queen Victoria sent President James Buchanan a message in Morse code. Although the jubilation at the feat was widespread, the cable itself was short-lived: it broke down three weeks afterward, and was not reconnected until 1866.

During the Panic of 1857, Field&#x27;s paper business suspended, and Peter Cooper, his neighbor in Gramercy Park, was the only one that kept him from going under.

On August 26, 1858, Field returned to a triumphant homecoming at Great Barrington, Massachusetts, saluting this Massachusetts boy made good. &quot;This has been a great day here,&quot; trumpeted &quot;The New York Times,&quot; &quot;The occasion was the reception of the welcome of Cyrus W. Field, Esq., the world-renowned parent of the Atlantic Telegraph Cable scheme, which has been so successfully completed.&quot;

Field&#x27;s activities brought him into contact with a number of prominent persons on both sides of the Atlantic – including Lord Clarendon and William Ewart Gladstone, the British Finance Minister at the time. Field&#x27;s communications with Gladstone would become important in the middle of the American Civil War, when three letters he received from Gladstone between November 27, 1862 and December 9, 1862 caused a furor, because Gladstone appeared to express support of the secessionist southern states in forming the Confederate States of America.

In 1866, Field laid a new, more durable trans-Atlantic cable using Brunel&#x27;s . &quot;Great Eastern&quot; was, at the time, the largest ocean-going ship in the world. His new cable provided almost instant communication across the Atlantic. On his return to Newfoundland, he grappled the cable he had attempted to lay the previous year and made it into a backup wire to the main cable.

In 1867, Field received a gold medal from the U.S. Congress and the grand prize at the International Exposition in Paris for his work on the transatlantic cable.

==Later years==
In the 1870s–80s, Field entered into transportation business. He served as president of the New York Elevated Railroad Company in 1877–1880 and collaborated with Jay Gould on developing the Wabash Railroad. Field also loaned Henry W. Grady the $20,000 used for Grady to buy a one-quarter interest in the Atlanta Constitution newspaper. He also owned the &quot;Mail and Express&quot;, a New York newspaper. Bad investments deprived Field of his fortune. He lived modestly during the last five years of his life in his native Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and died in 1892 at the age of 72.

==Commemoration==
Field and his wife are buried in Stockbridge, Massachusetts in the Stockbridge Cemetery in Berkshire County. His headstone reads: &quot;CYRUS WEST FIELD To whose courage, energy and perseverance the world owes The Atlantic Telegraph.&quot;
In December 1884, the Canadian Pacific Railway named the community of Field, British Columbia, Canada in his honor.

Cyrus Field Road, in Irvington, New York, where he died, is named after him. 

&quot;Fieldia&quot;, the burrowing Cambrian worm, is named after Field.

Ardsley, New York was named after Field&#x27;s ancestor, Zechariah Field, on Cyrus Field&#x27;s request. Zechariah Field was born in East Ardsley, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, and immigrated to America in 1629.

<text>Robert Malcolm Sapp (born September 22, 1973) is an American mixed martial artist, kickboxer, professional wrestler, actor, and former football player. He is currently under contract with Rizin Fighting Federation. Sapp has a combined fight record of 24–39–1, mostly fighting in Japan. He is well known in Japan, where he has appeared in numerous commercials, television programs, and various other media, and has released a music CD, &quot;Sapp Time&quot;. He is known there as a &quot;gaijin tarento&quot; (foreign-born talent). He is currently working sporadically for various MMA promotions in the U.S., Japan, and Europe.

Sapp played college football as a guard for the Washington Huskies with whom he won the Morris Trophy. He was selected in the third round of the 1997 NFL draft by the Chicago Bears with whom he played for one season seeing no game action before playing with the Minnesota Vikings for another two seasons, only playing in one game. He later began a career in professional wrestling before branching out into mixed martial arts and kickboxing, where he initially enjoyed significant success and popularity before eventually developing a reputation as a tomato can.

==American football career==
Sapp began his athletic career in high school playing football at Mitchell High School in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He received a football scholarship to the University of Washington, where he won the Morris Award in 1996. He took part in &quot;The Whammy in Miami&quot;, the Washington Huskies&#x27; upset win over the Miami Hurricanes that broke the latter&#x27;s 58 game home winning streak.

Sapp was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the third round (69th overall) of the 1997 NFL draft. He signed with the Minnesota Vikings after being released by the Bears. However, his career took a hit after he was suspended by the NFL in 1998 for steroid abuse. He spent two seasons with the Vikings and only played in one game. He is considered to be one of the worst picks of the NFL drafts.

Afterwards, Sapp was left in poverty after being defrauded by his economic advisor, and resorted to working at a funeral home moving coffins to make a living. He eventually decided to pursue a career in professional wrestling on the advice of his friend Mike Morris, who saw a chance for Sapp on it.

==Professional wrestling==
===Early career (2000–2002)===
Bob Sapp&#x27;s professional wrestling career started in NWA Wildside in 2000, before he was quickly contracted by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as a developmental wrestler. There he started honing his &quot;The Beast&quot; persona, which at this stage was a villainous, feral tarzan-like gimmick, but his development was cut short when the company was bought out by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He left professional wrestling for many years, attracted instead to a fighting career under the training of fellow WCW developmental wrestler Sam Greco.

===New Japan Pro-Wrestling and All Japan Pro Wrestling (2002–2005)===
In 2002, riding his success in K-1, Sapp made his professional wrestling debut for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). Introduced as a member of chairman Antonio Inoki&#x27;s army of fighters, Sapp replaced an injured Yoshihiro Takayama in his October 14 match against Manabu Nakanishi. The two exchanged taunts and attacks on the weeks leading to the match, with Sapp ultimately winning after executing his finishing move, the &quot;Beast Bomb&quot;, on the ringside, where he left Nakanishi to be counted out. This victory led to many other wrestlers to suggest to take their chance against Sapp, among them Yuji Nagata and Takayama himself, but the American refrained from participating.

Sapp balanced his NJPW appearances with similar ventures in All Japan Pro Wrestling, where he intruded to challenge Bill Goldberg and Keiji Mutoh. He first appeared in Wrestle-1, a copromotion between K-1 and AJPW, where he faced Mutoh&#x27;s alter ego The Great Muta in November 2002. Sapp defeated him after pinning him with a diving headbutt. He returned to the event in January 2003, where he wrestled his kickboxing rival Ernesto Hoost, yet this time Sapp lost after Hoost&#x27;s cornerman Johann Vos intervened in the bout.

In October 2003, Sapp returned to NJPW, taking part again of Inoki&#x27;s MMA army along with Takayama, Kazuyuki Fujita, Shinsuke Nakamura and Minoru Suzuki to face Nakanishi, Nagata, Hiroshi Tanahashi, Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Seiji Sakaguchi. He followed by some team matches along with Nakamura and AJPW&#x27;s Keiji Mutoh, but his main push would come in his singles career. On March 28, 2004, Sapp defeated Kensuke Sasaki to win the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, becoming the first (and only, to date) African-American to hold the title. After successfully defending the title against Shinsuke Nakamura on May 3 at &quot;Nexess&quot;, Sapp forfeited the title due to having lost to Kazuyuki Fujita in a mixed martial arts fight.

In 2005, Sapp returned to Wrestle-1, taking part on its inaugural Grand Prix tournament and beating Giant Bernard and Jun Akiyama in road to the finals. However, Wrestle-1 was discontinued before the tournament could win.

===Hustle (2007–2008)===
On October 16, 2007, Sapp made a surprise appearance at Hustle&#x27;s Korakuen Hall event, attacking Razor Ramon HG and his partner Wataru Sakata. Sapp aligned himself with Generalissimo Takada&#x27;s villainous Monster Army. After defeating Razor Ramon RG in his debut match for the company, it was announced that he would wrestle at the Hustlemania Yokohama Arena event. His opponent was later confirmed to be Razor Ramon HG, whom Sapp went on to defeat.

Sapp was later put into a tag team with fellow superheavyweight Monster Bono, but a falling out between the two due to miscommunications in the ring led Sapp to attack Bono with a chair. Sapp and Bono entered a short feud, which culminated with the American&#x27;s victory and Bono&#x27;s expulsion from the Monster Army. Sapp then started teaming up with Commander An Jo, eventually entering another feud with Hustle Army member Wataru Sakata. Sapp was defeated by him, breaking his winning streak in professional wrestling. He would try to bounce back by participating in the Hustle Grand Prix 2008, but he was shockingly eliminated by Osaka Pro Wrestling representative Zeus after having beaten Tiger Jeet Singh. After another short rivalry with Genichiro Tenryu, Sapp was defeated in a rematch against Bono as his last appearance for Hustle.

===Independent circuit (2008–2012)===
In 2008, Sapp began to participate in WWA, a pro wrestling organization in South Korea. On October 26, 2009, Sapp captured the WWA Heavyweight title by defeating Lee Wang-pyo. On July 24, 2011, Sapp made his debut for Dramatic Dream Team (DDT) at Ryōgoku Peter Pan 2011, using a &quot;Beast will fight for money&quot; gimmick. In a comedy match, he was defeated by Danshoku Dino, a wrestler with a homosexual character, being pinned after a kiss and a &quot;Gaydo Clutch&quot;.
===Return to New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2012–2013)===
At a NJPW event on December 20, 2012, Toru Yano announced that Sapp would represent the villainous Chaos stable on January 4, 2013, at Wrestle Kingdom 7 in Tokyo Dome. At the event, Sapp teamed with Yano, Takashi Iizuka and Yujiro Takahashi in an eight-man tag team match, where they were defeated by Akebono, Manabu Nakanishi, MVP and Strong Man. Sapp made another appearance for New Japan on April 7, 2013, at Invasion Attack, where he and Chaos stablemates Takashi Iizuka, Tomohiro Ishii and Yoshi-Hashi were defeated by Akebono, Hiroyoshi Tenzan, Manabu Nakanishi and Super Strong Machine in another eight-man tag team match.

===Wrestle-1 (2013)===
On September 8, Sapp took part in the Wrestle-1 promotion&#x27;s inaugural event, teaming with Keiji Mutoh in a main event tag team match, where they defeated René Duprée and Zodiac.

===Inoki Genome Federation (2009–2014)===
In 2009, he would compete in the Inoki Genome Federation (IGF). His last match was a lost to Aztecaser on December 31, 2014.

===Later Career (2014–2017)===
After leaving IGF, Sapp continued to wrestle in Japan until 2017.

==Kickboxing and mixed martial arts career==
In 2000, after Sapp was released from WCW, he was picked up by FX for its amateur boxing show &quot;The Toughman Competition&quot;. Sapp was pitted against William &quot;The Refrigerator&quot; Perry as a pro wrestling representative and, despite not having any prior boxing experience, won by knocking out Perry in round 2. Then Sapp&#x27;s friend and trainer Sam Greco showed his match to Kazuyoshi Ishii, chairman of Japanese kickboxing promotion K-1. Ishii then invited Sapp to Japan in order to start a career in the ring, seeing a combination of great potential and great marketability in him. After training for six months in United States in the AMC Pankration and Team Quest gyms, he would be sent to mixed martial arts company Pride Fighting Championship, which had expressed interest on him too, in order to make his professional debut first under such rules. Sapp competed under both rulesets indistinctly for the rest of his career, usually for the promotion K-1.

===K-1 and Japanese promotions===
====2002====
After arriving to Japan, Sapp debuted in Pride as a K-1 representative against former professional wrestler and longtime Fighting Network RINGS competitor Yoshihisa Yamamoto, who he finished by TKO at 2:44 of the first round by way of wild hooks. The bout, which attracted 10 million viewers, quickly turned Sapp into a fan favorite due to his size, charisma and aggression, and prepared him for his kickboxing debut against Tsuyoshi Nakasako a month later. Sapp lost by disqualification in 1:30 when he pushed Nakasako to the corner, threw him to the ground and rained illegal strikes on him until being restrained by ring crew. The act caused a brawl on the ring when the cornermen jumped in, but Sapp was surprisingly received with cheers from the crowd. He became an overnight sensation in Japan afterwards, appearing on numerous television shows and advertisements and becoming K-1&#x27;s most popular fighter. Sapp contributed by creating an outrageous public persona, nicknamed &quot;The Beast&quot;, under which he played an unhinged, loudmouthed, yet also humorous version of himself.

Sapp&#x27;s second Pride match was against two-time RINGS Openweight Champion Kiyoshi Tamura. Though Tamura was a highly respected fighter who held wins over the likes of Pat Miletich, Jeremy Horn and Renzo Gracie, he was giving up 150 lbs to his foe and was quickly overwhelmed by the much larger American, succumbing to strikes just 11 seconds into the bout.

In a show held by both Pride and K-1 called &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Sapp faced then Pride champion Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira. The latter had originally been slated for a kickboxing bout against K-1 fighter Mark Hunt, but negotiations fell out, as Nogueira had proposed to fight two separate bouts under mixed martial arts and kickboxing rules respectively, which was rejected by Hunt. The Pride champion then accepted to fight Sapp as a replacement, noting that &quot;nobody wanted to fight Sapp, and some other Pride fighters already had their fights matched.&quot; Due to the usual size disparity, this time amounting to 127 pounds, Nogueira accepted a special rule to ban knee strikes on the ground, making it a more even affair. Despite this, the match would quickly become a memorable battle of strength against technique.

Sapp opened the match almost finishing Nogueira in mere seconds, as the latter charged with a takedown only to be lifted and slammed onto his head in a piledriver. Sapp looked to repeat the technique, but Nogueira managed to avoid it and momentarily ready Sapp for an unsuccessful armbar. Taking his turn again, Sapp started punishing him with ground and pound through the Brazilian&#x27;s guard, nullifying his armlocks by sheer strength and landing powerbombs every time Nogueira tried his trademark triangle choke. The bout continued this way, with Nogueira trying fruitless submissions from the bottom while Sapp grinded him with heavy blows, until action finally slowed down into the second round, as Sapp was unaccustomed to fight for so long. Nogueira, who had endured the beating through impressive will and looked &quot;only half-conscious&quot; according to reviewers, finally pulled a tired Sapp down and mounted him. The Brazilian seized an armbar and, although Sapp blocked it, he had no left energy to resist and had to concede the hold and the match.

The fight received critical acclaim by reviewers, with website Ichiban Puroresu calling it &quot;an awesome fight&quot; and &quot;better drama than any fight this year,&quot; Keith Vargo commenting that &quot;victory and defeat were changing sides so fast that either man could have won any moment,&quot; and Scott Newman opining it was &quot;probably the best heavyweight fight [he had] ever seen in fact.&quot; Mirko Cro Cop, who would defeat Sapp in K-1, was quoted as, &quot;It was the craziest fight I&#x27;ve ever seen. I couldn&#x27;t believe that &#x27;Minotauro&#x27; was able to survive all the things that happened to him. He almost broke his spine. Unbelievable.&quot; Sapp himself was praised by his performance, to the extent Pride commentators Stephen Quadros and Bas Rutten speculating he could become a major fighter with only more training. He actually expressed desire for a rematch, but Nogueira, who came from the fight with both cheekbones broken, actively rejected it.

Sapp stated interest in fighting Fedor Emelianenko after he won the Pride Heavyweight Championship from Nogueira, which Emelianenko accepted, though joking he would have to gain 70 kg to face Sapp in even terms. Nothing of this materialized, and Sapp would never again compete in Pride, instead focusing his attention on K-1. When Sapp returned to the kickboxing ring the next month, this time against Cyril Abidi and with K-1 chairman Kazuyoshi Ishii as a special referee, he scored his first kickboxing victory, cornering his opponent and unloading punches and hammerfists on him for the KO.

His greatest in-ring success, though, would come in his match over K-1 legend Ernesto Hoost. They first met at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2002 Final Elimination on October 5, 2002, where Sapp replaced an injured Cro Cop in his bout against Hoost. The latter was expected to win thanks to his experience and technical superiority despite being outweighed by over 100 pounds, but Sapp claimed he would not need more than the first round to defeat Hoost, thus setting up an anticipated matchup. Once the fight came around, all while under a television viewership of 19.8%, Sapp surprised the crowd when he started dominating Hoost effectively through his already known charging strategy. By pushing Hoost against the ring&#x27;s corners and unloading punches there with all of his strength, Sapp controlled the entire the first round, and still landed controversially three more punches after the bell sounded. After the round, the ring doctor declared Hoost was unable to continue due to cuts, and Sapp was ultimately deemed winner while Hoost collapsed visibly in his corner, fulfilling his previous prediction.

His solid victory over Hoost, much like his dominant effort with Nogueira, proved that the trust put on Sapp by K-1 executives had not been in vain. Sapp would compare his situation to &quot;taking someone off the streets and throwing him into the ring with Mike Tyson and then watching that person win,&quot; given how much he had accomplished with so little experience and training. According to future adversary Mirko Cro Cop, Sapp&#x27;s reputation caused that many potential opponents were scared to fight him, both in Pride and K-1. However, Hoost was reportedly discontent with the match&#x27;s refereeing, citing the illegalities committed by Sapp, and expressed desire for a rematch.

Two months later, Sapp was slated to fight Semmy Schilt at K-1 World Grand Prix 2002 Final quarter-finals, but an injury suffered by the latter granted Hoost his second chance as a replacement. Sapp declared he would finish him in one round again. The bout would be a more even affair, however, as although Sapp looked to use his familiar strategy, this time Hoost scored a knockdown through two well placed body blows and survived the first round. Hoost followed on this tactic at the second, but Sapp eventually stunned him and knocked him down in return via repeated arm clubs to the head. The fighters went back and forth for the rest of the assault, until a drained Sapp finally managed to corner Hoost and overwhelm him with unanswered haymakers. At this point, referee Nobuaki Kakuda stopped the fight and gave Sapp the win. Those last seconds were a new source of controversy, as while Hoost was receiving continuous punishment, the stoppage still happened before he fell down. A worn Sapp forfeited his place in the tournament due to exhaustion and an injured hand, being ironically replaced by Hoost himself, who went to win the cup.

At the ending of 2002, Sapp fought professional wrestler Yoshihiro Takayama at the Inoki Bom-Ba-Ye event. After rushing Takayama to the ground as usual, Sapp proved he had his own way with basic submissions by transitioning to an armbar from mount, making the wrestler tap out. Their fight reached a 24.5 rating in TV. By this time, Sapp&#x27;s media schedule had grown up so much that he found himself without time to properly train for his fighting career. His trainer Matt Hume would describe it as, &quot;if he would have had time to dedicate to strict training, he would have been
a better fighter, however K-1 and Bob&#x27;s priority was media exposure, so we accepted it and worked with it.&quot;

====2003====
Sapp&#x27;s first defeat came at his fourth match, pitted against former K-1 champion Mirko Cro Cop on March 30, 2003. Despite being dedicated to mixed martial arts at the moment, Cro Cop had accepted the bout due to a lack of fighters willing to matchup with Sapp after his 2002 performance. Sapp also prepared specially for the fight, learning proper muay Thai and rumoredly training under Bas Rutten. Although Sapp pushed the fight for a minute, the mobile Cro Cop landed a liver shot and followed with a left hand that shattered Sapp&#x27;s orbital bone, causing him to collapse on the mat and give up while in visible pain. He would need urgent surgery to repair the damage. Both Sapp and Cro Cop later talked about rematching under MMA rules, but this never came to fruition. Before this, Sapp had been placed in an upcoming fight against Francisco Filho, which had to be scrapped due to Sapp being ruled out from competition due to the injury.

A month later, hoping to capitalize on the success of Sapp and others, K-1 made a new fighting division called &quot;Beast&quot; (Sapp&#x27;s nickname), which featured superheavyweights fighters such as Choi Hong-man. However, the division was stopped after two events due to disappointing reviews and gate takes. Still, Sapp was perceived to play a role in popularizing superheavyweights like Choi or Giant Silva in the sport, which he considered an accomplishment.

In August, Sapp participated in a special K-1 event in Las Vegas, where he went against Ultimate Fighting Championship veteran Kimo Leopoldo. Sapp had trained orthodox kickboxing with fellow UFC champion Maurice Smith for the match, and it could be noted in several powerful punches and knees that stunned Leopoldo. However, Sapp&#x27;s stamina started to falter, which a slightly better conditioned Leopoldo capitalized on to take his turn, eventually knocking Sapp down at the end of the round. Controversy happened before the second, as referee Nobuaki Kakuda seemed to be deliberately giving Sapp time to recover, but the match continued anyway. Perceiving himself outclassed at a technical level, Sapp decided to return to his old bullrushing style, which paid off quickly by knocking Leopoldo down with a left hand. The UFC fighter tried to return the favor, but Sapp was already en route to overpower him and finally rendered him KO with an unchecked rabbit punch. In a marked contrast to Japan, American audiences booed Sapp.

The event in Las Vegas would not end without more controversy, as the victorious Sapp got in a verbal confrontation with former boxing Undisputed Heavyweight Champion Mike Tyson, who was sitting at ringside. Tyson jumped on the ring after Sapp and caused a brief brawl, after which Sapp and him exchanged challenges for a bout between the two. It was soon announced by K-1 that the match was in talks, with Tyson considering training with kickboxing coach Jacob Duran in case the bout was hosted under K-1 rules. However, Tyson&#x27;s status as a convicted felon made him unable to get a visa to fight in Japan where the fight would have been most profitable. Other locations for the proposed fight were made, but the fight ultimately never happened.

Sapp returned to Japan in September, facing another superheavyweight, Stefan Gamlin, under MMA rules at K-1 Japan Grand Prix 2003. Despite being outweighed by the first time in his career, Sapp won in 0:52 with a guillotine choke. He continued challenging Tyson, claiming he would knock him out with high kicks, and also proposed a matchup against Francois Botha.

The next month, this time under K-1 rules, he fought Dutch champion Remy Bonjasky at the first round of the 2003 K-1 World Grand Prix. The match started with Bonjasky, famous for his flying knees and kicks, almost falling out the ring when Sapp threw him on the ropes in response to such attacks. The American chased a covered up Bonjasky through the ring while scoring punches and knees, but his opponent eventually bypassed his defense and landed a sharp roundhouse kick to end the first round. Bonkasky kept landing through the second, knocking Sapp down with a combination, but Sapp answered by pushing him to the ground and landing a heavy illegal punch. As Bonjasky refused to continue after the strike, Sapp was disqualified.

At the end of the year, Sapp was involved in a highly publicized matchup at K-1 PREMIUM 2003 Dynamite!! with former yokozuna Akebono Taro, who was doing his debut. The combined popularity of Sapp and Akebono attracted a crowd of 45,000 to the Nagoya Dome and granted the event a 43% viewership (roughly 54 million of the 127 million people in Japan at the time), making it the first time a combat sports event outdrew the NHK music festival &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot;, Japan&#x27;s traditionally biggest New Year&#x27;s Eve show. The classical matchup of an American foreigner like Sapp against a Japanese national like Taro, a cultural contraposition, also gained comparisons with Japanese professional wrestling legend Rikidōzan in his bouts against The Sharpe Brothers. The match itself, however, was short and intense. Though outweighed by over 150 pounds, Sapp had the advantage at experience and stamina, allowing him endure Akebono&#x27;s initially energetic sumo pushes in order to counterattack. He attacked Akebono with low kicks and punching combinations to the head and body, knocking him down twice before finishing him by KO at 2:58. After defeating Akebono, Sapp engaged in another verbal exchange with Mike Tyson about a possible match, although nothing came from it.

====2004–2007====
Sapp opened 2004 facing Dolgorsürengiin Sumyaabazar, multiple wrestling champion and brother to yokozuna Asashoryu, under a mixed martial arts ruleset at his own event, K-1 Beast. Showing improvement in his MMA technique, Sapp defended from his guard after being taken down, trading short strikes from there and threatening with Kimura locks. Sumyaabazar ended up passing his guard, but Sapp reversed and captured his back, almost closing a rear naked choke, Sumyaabazar had to abandon the match before the second round due to a groin injury. Only two weeks later, he fought against Seth Petruzelli, this time at kickboxing, but the result was similar: although he knocked Sapp down, Petruzelli injured his biceps and was forced to bow out.

After a 0:33 victory over muay thai journeyman Tommy Glanville, Sapp was pitted against wrestler Kazuyuki Fujita at K-1 Romanex. Although the American looked to strike, Fujita scored an early takedown and initiated a grappling scuffle. Sapp looked to defend from the bottom and at one point pursued a heel hook, transitioned into a toehold, but the Japanese escaped to his feet and started delivering soccer kicks with his wrestling shoes to Sapp&#x27;s head. Fujita kept landing brutal kicks and punches to a desperately covered up Sapp until the latter tapped out at 2:15. After this sound loss, Sapp lost again in a two-round fight against Ray Sefo.

At K-1 Premium Dynamite!! Sapp faced Jérôme Le Banner in a special mixed rules match, in which first and third rounds would be under regular K-1 rules and under MMA rules the second and fourth. Sapp spent the first round covering and guarding up, almost being finished, but he recovered in the second one by taking down Le Banner and raining ground and pound from the mount. He kept the momentum at the third, utilizing a defensive strategy of charging and clinching to neutralize Le Banner; however, most of the action would take place at the fourth and last, which saw the two trading dominant positions and ended with Sapp looking for an armlock. Under the agreed upon rules, the fight was declared a draw. Sapp dedicated the fight to the memory of sparring partner Masaaki Miyamoto&#x27;s father who had recently died.

2005 would be a fruitful year for Sapp, starting by a win over judo medalist Kim Min-soo at K-1&#x27;s new MMA sub-promotion Hero&#x27;s. Although the debutant Kim, clad in a full judogi, managed to cut Sapp with an early punch, the American swiftly overpowered him and knocked him out to punches in a minute. This prepared Sapp for a run to the 2005 K-1 Hiroshima Grand Prix, where he would face three fighters on a single night in order to qualify for the 2005 K-1 World Grand Prix. In a departure from his explosive yet ephemeral performances up to the point, Sapp showcased greatly improved stamina and much better technique, gained both after intensive training under his long time friend Sam Greco.

Sapp met upcoming fighter Yoshihiro Nakao in the quarter-final, where he would fight all three rounds in dominant fashion. Nakao taunted Sapp during the fight, but the American kept landing kicks and knees in addition to his personal bullrushing style, including also previously unseen counterstrikes. After securing a unanimous decision, Sapp advanced round and faced young fighter Hiraku Hori, who had just defeated. This time Sapp increased his aggression and came near to finishing Hori early with a barrage of punches and a cut, but the Japanese resisted and kept him at bay with high kicks towards the end of the first round. The second would see Sapp uncharacteristically standing still and inviting his opponent to charge at him, which he capitalized on to knock down Hori with hooks before finishing him. The final saw Sapp being pitted against Tatsufumi Tomihira, a karateka famous for his own fouls. The American methodically dismantled Tomihira, scoring two consecutive knockdowns in the first seconds and almost finishing him in the last ones with a cornering barrage. After slowing down in the second and third rounds, where they exchanged kicks and punches, Sapp controlled him for a unanimous decision win, taking the victory at the tournament.

In the post-event interview, Greco praised Sapp&#x27;s dedication, while Sapp himself gave a speech about his tenure. &quot;I&#x27;ve had low points in my career, now this is a high point and I am enjoying it! I think I&#x27;ve proven I belong in K-1.&quot; As promised, Sapp won a prize of 5,000,000 yen and a place among the 16 fighters qualified for the K-1 World Grand Prix.

Shortly after, Sapp returned to MMA format for Hero&#x27;s, where he was pitted against Russian sumo wrestler Alan Karaev. With Sapp&#x27;s former opponent Akebono in attendance, Karaev surprised the American with aggression and a quick takedown to mount, but Sapp managed to get out after a failed rear naked choke attempt and hold his own mount for a longer time. Restarted the fight on the feet, Sapp knocked Karaev out with a left jab.

Come the K-1 Grand Prix 2005, Sapp was paired against fellow superheavyweight Choi Hong-man in the first round. Choi&#x27;s large reach and great size allowed him to land hits regularly through Sapp&#x27;s charges, but the latter pressed on and got an early knockdown by low kicks to the knee. However, although Sapp came aggressively again in the second round, his stamina started faltering, giving Choi the chance to unload multiple punches. Ultimately, a series of wild battles against an already similarly tired Choi were decided in the latter&#x27;s favor, granting him a majority decision win.

On May 13, 2006, Sapp was to headline the K-1 show in the Netherlands against Ernesto Hoost, in which Hoost had stated that it was to be his last match in the Netherlands before his retirement. Sapp attended all the pre-fight press conferences and even attended the opening ceremonies for the show. It is unclear at the moment as to why, but Sapp pulled out of the event midway through the show. K-1 issued a statement claiming Sapp pulled out due to new demands he brought to promoters during the show. Sapp disagreed with K-1&#x27;s account of events, claiming the promotion had tried to delay his payment without any contractual safety.

However, he did participate in 2007&#x27;s K-1 event in the Amsterdam Arena, fighting as a replacement for Remy Bonjasky against Peter Aerts. Sapp lost the fight by KO within 20 seconds in the first round by a knee to the liver.

After his falling out with K-1, Sapp began to get offers from World Wrestling Entertainment as well as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling to work with them, but his K-1 contract prohibited him from going through with any return to the ring. It was reported WWE was considering an angle between Sapp and Chris Benoit in case they managed to clear his contract out, but they were unsuccessful. Sapp finally made a surprise return to the K-1 ring in Japan after a two-year absence against comedian and part-time K-1 competitor Bobby Ologun. Ologun was unable to mount any effective offense as he was quickly run down and overpowered by Sapp in the first round. Afterwards, with his K-1 contract finally done, Sapp signed up with Hustle and focused on his professional wrestling career.

===After K-1===
Since his last matches for K-1 in 2007, Sapp continued his career for small promotions in a limited, non-competitive in-ring way that was described as throwing fights. He would step into the ring after great amounts of promotion, often against upcoming stars and heavily promoted local fighters, only to turtle down and tap out in a few seconds. This routine, labelled in sports as a &quot;tomato can&quot; act, effectively ended his already inconsistent reputation in the sports, attracting large losing streaks and the accusations of &quot;making a mockery of the sport of MMA&quot; and &quot;being a one-man circus&quot;. His usual commentator Mirko Cro Cop expressed his belief that Sapp was intentionally allowing himself to lose against very inferior opponents.

When asked about it, Sapp denied he was throwing fights, and claimed he was doing this routine to collect quick paychecks in a late career he did not deem economically worthy to risk his health. He also pointed out a perceived injustice in contemporaneous MMA business, where fighters carrying accolades and important legacies would be left in economic instability after retiring. He explained:

====Cage Rage, Strike Force and BAMMA====
On February 10, 2007, it was announced by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Cage Rage promotion that Sapp would appear on its Cage Rage 21 event on April 21, facing Gary Turner. The move was partly a retaliatory one, as the UFC had chosen to run its first British show in years that same night at the Manchester Evening News Arena, headlined by Mirko Cro Cop, Andrei Arlovski and British star Michael Bisping. Though Cage Rage promoter Andy Geer said that the UFC show would not affect ticket sales for CR21, the signing of Sapp was a clear sign that the company knew it would need a superstar draw in order to successfully compete with the American promotion. A few days before the event Bob Sapp pulled out of the scheduled fight. On short notice, Tank Abbott stepped in for Sapp and lost to Gary Turner.

Sapp faced the South African fighter Jan &quot;The Giant&quot; Nortje at the event in Tacoma, Washington, at the Tacoma Dome on February 23, 2008. Sapp was defeated at the 55-second mark of the first round by TKO after receiving an unanswered amount of punches. Sapp then returned to Japan on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2008 and defeated Akihito Tanaka via first-round TKO.

Sapp lost to Japanese Ikuhisa Minowa at &quot;Dream 9&quot; on May 26, 2009, due to Achilles lock. He fought and lost to Bobby Lashley at Ultimate Chaos in Biloxi, Mississippi, on June 27, 2009, due to first round tapout from strikes. On October 6, Sapp stood in for an injured Gegard Mousasi to face Rameau Thierry Sokoudjou in the semi-finals at Dream 11. He lost via TKO (punches) in the first round.

On November 27, Sapp fought against Swedish K-1 veteran Jörgen Kruth. The fight got a lot of publicity in Swedish and international press, but ended with an anticlimax when Sapp&#x27;s corner threw in the towel after only 45 seconds, after Kruth hit Sapp with a knee to the liver.

Sapp was next going to face Stav Economou at BAMMA 5, but the event was canceled due to extreme weather conditions.

====Dynamite, ONE and Legend====
Sapp was scheduled to fight at K1 Dynamite!! 2010. He was set to battle Shinichi Suzukawa on New Year&#x27;s Eve in a Pancrase-style matchup, but pulled out at the last minute due to contract disputes. When questioned about Sapp&#x27;s refusal to fight on the day of the event, FEG President Sadaharu Tanikawa asked, &quot;Does anyone actually care? I don&#x27;t know the reasons why, but we did our best to make him fight. He just said he didn&#x27;t want to. This is typical [of Sapp].&quot; Sapp claims he refused to fight after promoters were contracted to pay him $30,000 for the fight, but Tanikawa only offered him $15,000 after he arrived in Japan for the event.

On February 11, 2012, Sapp debuted for the Asian ONE Fighting Championship promotion. He faced Rolles Gracie at ONE Fighting Championship: Battle of Heroes in Jakarta, Indonesia and lost via submission to strikes in the first round.

Sapp fought in the main event of the Super Fight League&#x27;s inaugural event, SFL 1, against James Thompson on March 11, 2012. Sapp tapped out due to a Thompson takedown that caused a leg injury to Sapp in the first round.

He also fought Yōsuke Nishijima in Nishijima&#x27;s retirement fight under kickboxing rules &quot;Legend 4&quot; in Kumamoto, Japan on November 17, 2013. Sapp was dropped with a body shot, stood back up but was then finished with body shots followed by couple of right hooks.

Sapp announced his retirement in April 2014 citing that he&#x27;d paid off big medical bills and will be retiring with several million dollars in savings (including money doing work outside of fights).

Returning to kickboxing after a nearly two-year hiatus, Sapp appeared at Fight Night Saint Tropez on August 4, 2017, in Saint Tropez, France. He faced Greg Tony and lost the bout via TKO in the first round.

On January 27, 2018, Sapp faced Selcuk Ustabasi at MFC 24. Sapp lost the bout via TKO in the first round.

===Rizin Fighting Federation===
Sapp had a rematch against Akebono with shoot boxing rules on December 31, 2015, at Rizin Fighting Federation Grand Prix event. Unlike his usual performances, he won the fight by technical decision.

He returned in September 2018 at Rizin 13, where he fought former sumo Osunaarashi. Sapp received intense striking during the first round and was taken down at the second, but he reversed Osunaarashi as they fell and gained top position, from which he controlled the rest of the round. He went to dominate an uneventful last round for a unanimous decision and his first MMA win in nearly nine years.

===Boxing===
Sapp was said to go up against Mike Tyson in a 8-round exhibition boxing match, however no personal terms were agreed and Tyson fought Roy Jones Jr. instead.

===Clout MMA===
Sapp was scheduled to fight Piotr Piechowiak at Clout MMA 2: Omielańczuk vs. Bad Boy, but the bout was cancelled.

===Fight Circus===
In 2021, Sapp joined appeared at Full Metal Dojo&#x27;s Fight Circus 2 in Thailand and started competing regularly in the promotion. On April 2, 2023, Sapp competed in the main event of &quot;Fight Circus 6: The Rise or Fall of Sloppy Balboa&quot; in a two-on-two boxing match, teaming up with Quinton Jackson against the promotion&#x27;s CEO, Jon Nutt and Bangtao Muay Thai strength and conditioning coach Andrew Wood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sapp/Rampage&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Sapp and Jackson also recreated the Rocky chicken chase scene ahead of the match. Sapp and Jackson were tied together wearing an oversized t-shirt. The event was presented on FITE and Jackson and Sapp won by third-round TKO.

==Fighting style==
Having no background in martial arts prior to his fighting career, Sapp&#x27;s fighting style was relatively devoid of technique, and was more so distinguished by an aggressive usage of size and strength, pressuring his opponents with an unorthodox &quot;bullrush&quot; technique (which he dubbed as &quot;NFL Style&quot;), whereby he would rush an opponent, usually at the beginning of the round, and overwhelm them with a barrage of punches.

Although defined by his brute strength, Sapp&#x27;s wins over opponents such as Yoshihiro Takayama and Stefan Gamlin showed that he did possess a knowledge of basic submission techniques.

==Personal life==
In December 2017, it was reported in Japanese newspaper &quot;Shukan Bunshun&quot; that a woman claiming to be Sapp&#x27;s girlfriend accused him of domestic violence. She provided photographs of the alleged injuries and told how she had been abused by Sapp for six years. Although the article included an apology message supposedly sent by him, Sapp did not make public comments about the accusation. No civil suit was filed, and no criminal proceedings were announced as a result of the allegations.

<text>The carrick mat is a flat woven decorative knot which can be used as a mat or pad. Its name is based on the mat&#x27;s decorative-type carrick bend with the ends connected together, forming an endless knot. A larger form, called the prolong knot, is made by expanding the basic carrick mat by extending, twisting, and overlapping its outer bights, then weaving the free ends through them. This process may be repeated to produce an arbitrarily long mat.

In its basic form it is the same as a 3-lead, 4-bight Turk&#x27;s head knot. The basic carrick mat, made with two passes of rope, also forms the central motif in the logo of the International Guild of Knot Tyers. 

When tied to form a cylinder around the central opening, instead of lying flat, it can be used as a woggle.

<doc id="204199" wikidata="Q5245054" url="?curid=204199" title="Deacons for Defense and Justice">
<text>The Deacons for Defense and Justice was an Black American self-defense group founded in November 1964, during the civil rights era in the United States, in the mill town of Jonesboro, Louisiana. On February 21, 1965—the day of Malcolm X&#x27;s assassination—the first affiliated chapter was founded in Bogalusa, Louisiana, followed by a total of 20 other chapters in this state, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Alabama. It was intended to protect civil rights activists and their families, threatened both by white vigilantes and discriminatory treatment by police under Jim Crow laws. The Bogalusa chapter gained national attention during the summer of 1965 in its violent struggles with the Ku Klux Klan.

By 1968, the Deacons&#x27; activities were declining, following passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the entry of Black people into politics in the South, and the rise of the Black Power movement. Black people worked to gain control of more political and economic activities in their communities.

A television movie, &quot;Deacons for Defense&quot; (2003), directed by Bill Duke and starring Forest Whitaker, was aired about the 1965 events in Bogalusa. The movie inspired Mauricelm-Lei Millere to meet Deacon Hicks at his Hicks House in Bogalusa, Louisiana. The Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Hicks House in Bogalusa commemorates one of the leaders of the Deacons in that city; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. Fundraising continues for a civil rights museum in Bogalusa to honor the work of the Deacons for Defense; it was expected to open in 2018.

==History==
The Deacons were not the first champions of armed-defense during the civil rights movement, but in November 1964, they were the first to organize as a force.

According to historian Annelieke Dirks,

Even Martin Luther King Jr.—the icon of nonviolence—employed armed bodyguards and had guns in his house during the early stages of the Montgomery bus boycott in 1956. Glenn Smiley, an organizer of the nonviolent and pacifist Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR), observed during a house visit to King that the police did not allow the minister a weapon permit, but &quot;the place is an arsenal.&quot;

Smiley convinced King that he could not keep such weapons or plan armed &quot;self-defense&quot;, as it was inconsistent with his public positions on non-violence. Dirks explored the emergence of Black groups for self-defense in Clarksdale and Natchez, Mississippi from 1960 to 1965.

In many areas of the Deep South, local chapters of the Ku Klux Klan or other white insurgents operated outside the law, and white-dominated police forces practiced discrimination against Black people. In Jonesboro, an industrial town in northern Louisiana, the KKK harassed local activists, burned crosses on the lawns of Foundational Black American voters, and burned down five churches, a Masonic hall, and a Baptist center.

Scholar Akinyele O. Umoja notes that by 1965, both the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and CORE supported armed self-defense, although they had long promoted non-violence as a tactic to achieve civil rights. They began to believe that changes in federal law were not sufficient to advance civil rights or to protect activists locally. National CORE leadership, including James Farmer, publicly acknowledged a relationship between CORE and the Deacons for Defense in Louisiana. This alliance between the two organizations highlighted the concept of armed self-defense embraced by many Black people in the South, who had long been subject to white violence. A significant portion of SNCC&#x27;s southern-born leadership and staff also supported armed self-defense.

Robert F. Williams, president of the NAACP chapter in Monroe, North Carolina, transformed his local NAACP chapter into an armed self-defense unit. He was criticized for this by the national leaders of the NAACP. After he was charged by the state with kidnapping a white couple whom he had sheltered during local violence related to the Freedom Riders in 1961, Williams and his wife left the country, going into exile in Cuba. After Williams&#x27; return in 1969, his trial on these charges was scheduled in 1975; that year the state reviewed the case and withdrew the charges. Fannie Lou Hamer of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party was another activist who armed herself; she said that in 1964 during Freedom Summer, she kept several loaded guns under her bed.

==Founding of the Deacons for Defense==
Black Americans were harassed and attacked by white KKK vigilantes in the mill town of Jonesboro, Louisiana in 1964 including the torching of five churches, a Masonic hall and a Baptist center. Given these threats, Earnest &quot;Chilly Willy&quot; Thomas and Frederick Douglass Kirkpatrick founded the Deacons for Defense in November 1964 to protect civil rights workers, their families and the Black community against the local KKK. Most of the Deacons were veterans with combat experience from the Korean War and World War II. Born in Jonesboro on November 20, 1935, Thomas grew up in the segregated state decades after the white-dominated state legislature had disenfranchised most Black people at the turn of the century and imposed Jim Crow laws. Drawn into local rivalries between Black and white children for swimming hole rights, Thomas learned that rights and access come not to those who ask but rather those who fight.

In 1964, during Freedom Summer and a period of extensive voter education and organizing for registration, especially in Mississippi, the Congress of Racial Equality established a Freedom House in Jonesboro. It became a target of the Klan who resented white activists staying there. Because of repeated attacks on the Freedom House, as well as the church burnings, the Black community decided to organize to defend it. Before The Deacons of Defense and Justice officially formed, two groups were operating in Jonesboro to protect Foundational Black Americans. One group acted as sentries outside the Freedom House, led by Percy Lee Bradford, a stock room worker, and Earnest Thomas. Frederick Douglass Kirkpatrick, a high school teacher, organized a second group that volunteered to monitor police arrests of Black Americans while also working to keep the community safe. Thomas was one of the first volunteers to guard the house. According to historian Lance Hill, &quot;Thomas was eager to work with CORE but he had reservations about the nonviolent terms imposed by the young activists&quot;. Around this time, CORE began protesting against the segregation of a public swimming pool as well as the Jonesboro Public Library. The Ku Klux Klan and local police organized a caravan to intimidate the protesters and the African American community in Jonesboro. Thomas and Kirkpatrick organized a twenty men group to protect the citizens of Jonesboro, starting the Deacons.

Thomas, who had military training, quickly emerged as the leader of this budding defense organization. He was joined by Kirkpatrick, a civil rights activist and member of Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), who had been ordained that year as a minister in the Pentecostal Church of God in Christ. Coretta Jackson acted as treasurer for The Deacons Of Defense and Justice. We Had been arrested for possession of a concealed weapon while protecting protesting students. The Deacons had strict membership criteria for applicants. They accepted only male American citizens over the age of 21. They preferred married men with military service, as well as registered voters. They refused men with a reputation for &quot;hotheadedness&quot;. They vigorously upheld their stance of only acting in defense. They continued guarding CORE as a means to further the civil rights agenda. Every member of the Deacons had to pledge his life for the defense of justice, Black people, and for civil rights workers.

During the day, the men concealed their guns. At night they carried them openly, as was allowed by the law, to discourage Klan activity at the site and in the Black community. In early 1965, Black students were picketing the local high school in Jonesboro for integration. They were confronted by hostile police ready to use fire trucks with hoses against them. A car carrying four Deacons arrived. In view of the police, these men loaded their shotguns. The police ordered the fire truck to withdraw. This was the first time in the 20th century, as Hill observes, that &quot;an armed Black organization had successfully used weapons to defend a lawful protest against an attack by law enforcement&quot;. Hill also wrote &quot;In Jonesboro, the Deacons made history when they compelled Louisiana governor John McKeithen to intervene in the city&#x27;s civil rights crisis and require a compromise with city leaders — the first capitulation to the civil rights movement by a Deep South governor&quot;.

After traveling 300 miles to Bogalusa, in southeast Louisiana, on February 21, 1965, Kirkpatrick, Thomas and a CORE member worked with local leaders to organize the first affiliated Deacons chapter. Black activists in the company mill town were being attacked by the local and powerful Ku Klux Klan. The police and sheriff in Bogalusa as well as most government organizations were all infiltrated by the Klan. The only protection the people of Bogalusa had against the Klan was the Deacons. Although the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had been passed, Black people were making little progress toward integration of public facilities in the city or registering to vote. Activists Bob Hicks (1929–2010), Charles Sims, and A. Z. Young, workers at the Crown-Zellerbach plant (Georgia-Pacific after 1985, later acquired by another), led this new chapter of the Deacons for Defense. Charles Sims, a World War II veteran was the president of the Bogalusa chapter of the Deacons. He acted as spokesman for the Deacons, demanding fair treatment and threatening violent retaliation in the event of attack. Sims considered the Deacons a &quot;defense guard unit&quot; who had formed simply &quot;because we got tired of the women, the children being harassed by the white night-riders&quot;.

The Chicago Chapter of the Deacons for Defense and Justice was formed by Earnest Thomas, vice president of the Jonesboro chapter, in 1965. The Deacons intended to spread throughout the North and the West but were unsuccessful because their tactics were less effective outside of the South.

In the summer of 1965, the Bogalusa chapter campaigned for integration and came into regular conflict with the Klan in the city. The state police established a base there in the spring in expectation of violence after the Deacons organized. Before the summer, the first Black deputy sheriff of the local Washington Parish was assassinated by whites.

The Deacons&#x27; militant confrontation with the Klan in Bogalusa throughout the summer of 1965 was planned to gain federal government intervention. These tactics proved successful when &quot;in July 1965, escalating hostilities between the Deacons and the Klan in Bogalusa provoked the federal government to use Reconstruction-era laws to order local police departments to protect civil rights workers&quot;. The Deacons also initiated a regional organizing campaign, founding a total of 21 formal chapters and 46 affiliates in other cities. 

==Role==
The Deacons had a relationship with other civil rights groups that practiced non-violence. Such support by the Deacons allowed the NAACP and CORE to formally observe their traditional parameters of non-violence.

The Deacons provided protection for CORE leader, James Farmer in 1965. Farmer arrived in Bogalusa in order to aid in desegregation and required the protection of the Deacons. They ensured his safety from the time he arrived at the New Orleans airport and provided security while Farmer spoke and marched at desegregation events.

The Deacons attracted media attention for their protection of Charles Evers&#x27; desegregation campaign in Natchez, Mississippi. Attention was given to them because, unlike similar groups that had come before, the Deacons did not hide their names from the media. This coupled with their use of armed self-defense, and modest beginnings, made them heroes to harassed black communities.

After the successful integration of the Jonesboro Public Library, the Ku Klux Klan burned crosses in response. The Deacons wrote leaflets threatening to kill anyone who burned a cross. The leaflets were distributed into the homes of white people by their black house workers. The cross-burnings stopped in response.

On July 8, 1965, at a nonviolent march on city hall, hundreds of whites gathered to throw rocks at the assembled protesters. The white antagonists surrounded the protesters. A twenty-one year old insurance salesman and Air Force veteran named Henry Austin confronted the mob and fired a warning shot. He then shot an advancing attacker three times in the chest. After the shooting the mob dispersed. Both Austin and the attacker survived the encounter.

In Bogalusa, the Deacons worked with CORE on their campaigns. When the local police and Ku Klux Klan joined forces to attempt to harass two white CORE members and drive them out of town, the Deacons intervened on behalf of the white volunteers, protecting them from the police. The Deacons stood guard outside CORE headquarters and patrolled the Foundational Black American community. The Deacons would protect both white and black activists as they canvassed looking for voters. They would also transport civil rights workers into and out of Bogalusa. There were by-laws that each member had to uphold. Sims was very clear about the roles of the Deacons: they were to act in self-defense only.

The Deacons were instrumental in other campaigns led by the Civil Rights Movement. Activist James Meredith organized the June 1966 March Against Fear, to go from Memphis, Tennessee to Jackson, Mississippi. He wanted a low-key affair, but was shot and wounded early in the march. Other major civil rights leaders and organizations recruited hundreds and then thousands of marchers in order to continue Meredith&#x27;s effort.

According to in a 1999 article, activist Stokely Carmichael encouraged having the Deacons provide security for the remainder of the march. After some debate, many civil rights leaders agreed, including Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Umoja wrote, &quot;Finally, though expressing reservations, King conceded to Carmichael&#x27;s proposals to maintain unity in the march and the movement. The involvement and association of the Deacons with the march signified a shift in the civil rights movement, which had been popularly projected as a &#x27;nonviolent movement.&quot;&#x27;

Stokely Carmichael had first made a speech about Black Power in Mobile, Alabama in 1965, when marchers demonstrating for the vote reached the state capital from Selma. In 1967 Carmichael said, &quot;Those of us who advocate Black Power are quite clear in our own minds that a &#x27;non-violent&#x27; approach to civil rights is an approach black people cannot afford and a luxury white people do not deserve.&quot;

In his 2006 book, Hill discusses the difficulties in achieving change on the local level in the South after national leaders and activists left. He wrote,

the hard truth is that these organizations produced few victories in their local projects in the Deep South--if success is measured by the ability to force changes in local government policy and create self-governing and sustainable local organizations that could survive when the national organizations departed ... The Deacons&#x27; campaigns frequently resulted in substantial and unprecedented victories at the local level, producing real power and self-sustaining organizations.

According to Hill, local (armed) groups laid the foundation for equal opportunities for Foundational Black Americans.

According to a 2007 article by Dirks, the usual histories of the Civil Rights Movement tend to overlook such organizations as the Deacons. She says there are several reasons: First, the dominant ideology of the Movement was one of non-violence. Second, threats to the lives of Deacons&#x27; members required them to maintain secrecy to avoid terrorist attacks. In addition, they recruited only mature male members, in contrast to other more informal self-defense efforts, in which women and teenagers sometimes played a role. Finally, the organization was relatively short-lived, fading by 1968. In that period, there was a national shift in attention to the issues of Black communities in the North and the rise of the Black Power movement in 1966. The Deacons were overshadowed by The Black Panther Party, which became noted for its militancy.

==FBI investigation begins in 1965==
In February 1965, after an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about the Deacons in Jonesboro, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover became interested in the group. His office sent a memo to its Louisiana field offices: &quot;Because of the potential for violence indicated, you are instructed to immediately initiate an investigation of the DDJ [Deacons for Defense and Justice].&quot; As was eventually exposed in the late 1970s, the FBI established the COINTELPRO program, through which its agents were involved in many illegal activities against organizations that Hoover deemed &quot;a threat to the American way&quot;.

The Bureau ultimately produced more than 1,500 pages of comprehensive and relatively accurate records on the Deacons and their activities, largely through numerous informants close to or who had infiltrated the organization. Members of the Deacons were repeatedly questioned and intimidated by F.B.I. agents. Harvie Johnson (the last surviving original member of the Deacons for Defense and Justice) was interviewed by two agents during this period. He said they asked only how the Deacons obtained their weapons, never questioning him about the Klan activity or police actions they were responding to. Although the FBI and white media regarded the Deacons as bringers of race warfare, they actually worked closely with CORE in their nonviolent protests as a way to bring about change in Bogalusa. The Federal Government finally intervened and forced local police to uphold the law and protect citizens&#x27; right. As a result of the Deacons&#x27; actions the Klan had to restrict themselves to night terror raids. The Deacons served as a symbol of power and pride, and undermined the stereotype of black submission.

According to columnist Ken Blackwell in 2007, activist Roy Innis had said that the Deacons &quot;forced the Klan to re-evaluate their actions and often change their undergarments&quot;.

==Commemoration==
* The Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Hicks House in Bogalusa is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Hicks Foundation is in the process of restoring and preserving the house.

==Representation in other media==
* Michael D&#x27;Antonio wrote a fictional short story, &quot;Deacons for Defense&quot;, based on events in Bogalusa, Louisiana.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1256877/
* The Deacons in Bogalusa are the subject of a 2003 television movie, &quot;Deacons for Defense&quot;. Based on D&#x27;Antonio&#x27;s story and produced by Showtime, it was directed by Bill Duke. The movie stars Academy Award winner Forest Whitaker, with Ossie Davis, and Jonathan Silverman. The film explores development of the group through events of 1964 and 1965. The plot follows the transition of a black family and community members from belief in non-violence to supporting armed self-defense.

<doc id="204207" wikidata="Q657057" url="?curid=204207" title="The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art">
<text>The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art is a Chinese mathematics book, composed by several generations of scholars from the 10th–2nd century BCE, its latest stage being from the 1st century CE. This book is one of the earliest surviving mathematical texts from China, the others being the &quot;Suan shu shu&quot; (202 BCE – 186 BCE) and &quot;Zhoubi Suanjing&quot; (compiled throughout the Han until the late 2nd century CE). It lays out an approach to mathematics that centres on finding the most general methods of solving problems, which may be contrasted with the approach common to ancient Greek mathematicians, who tended to deduce propositions from an initial set of axioms.

Entries in the book usually take the form of a statement of a problem, followed by the statement of the solution and an explanation of the procedure that led to the solution. These were commented on by Liu Hui in the 3rd century.

The book was later included in the early Tang collection, the &quot;Ten Computational Canons&quot;.

==History==
=== Original book ===
The full title of &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot; appears on two bronze standard measures which are dated to 179 CE, but there is speculation that the same book existed beforehand under different titles.

The title is also mentioned in volume 24 of the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; as one of the books studied by Ma Xu (馬續). Based on this known knowledge, his younger brother Ma Rong (馬融) places the date of composition to no later than 93 CE.

Most scholars believe that Chinese mathematics and the mathematics of the ancient Mediterranean world had developed more or less independently up to the time when &quot;The Nine Chapters&quot; reached its final form. The method of chapter 7 was not found in Europe until the 13th century, and the method of chapter 8 uses Gaussian elimination before Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855). There is also the mathematical proof given in the treatise for the Pythagorean theorem. The influence of &quot;The Nine Chapters&quot; greatly assisted the development of ancient mathematics in the regions of Korea and Japan. Its influence on mathematical thought in China persisted until the Qing dynasty era.

Liu Hui wrote a detailed commentary in 263. He analyses the procedures of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Nine Chapters&quot; step by step, in a manner which is clearly designed to give the reader confidence that they are reliable, although he is not concerned to provide formal proofs in the Euclidean manner. Liu&#x27;s commentary is of great mathematical interest in its own right. Liu credits the earlier mathematicians Zhang Cang (fl. 165 BCE – d. 142 BCE) and Geng Shouchang (fl. 75 BCE – 49 BCE) (see armillary sphere) with the initial arrangement and commentary on the book, yet Han dynasty records do not indicate the names of any authors of commentary, as they are not mentioned until the 3rd century

&quot;The&quot; &quot;Nine Chapters&quot; is an anonymous work, and its origins are not clear. Until recent years, there was no substantial evidence of related mathematical writing that might have preceded it, with the exception of mathematical work by those such as Jing Fang (78–37 BCE), Liu Xin (d. 23), and Zhang Heng (78–139) and the geometry clauses of the &quot;Mozi&quot; of the 4th century BCE. This is no longer the case. The &quot;Suàn shù shū&quot; (算數書) or &quot;Writings on Reckonings&quot; is an ancient Chinese text on mathematics approximately seven thousand characters in length, written on 190 bamboo strips. It was discovered together with other writings in 1983 when archaeologists opened a tomb in Hubei province. It is among the corpus of texts known as the Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts. From documentary evidence this tomb is known to have been closed in 186 BCE, early in the Western Han dynasty. While its relationship to &quot;The Nine Chapters&quot; is still under discussion by scholars, some of its contents are clearly paralleled there. The text of the &quot;Suàn shù shū&quot; is however much less systematic than &quot;The Nine Chapters&quot;; and appears to consist of a number of more or less independent short sections of text drawn from a number of sources. The &quot;Zhoubi Suanjing&quot;, a mathematics and astronomy text, was also compiled during the Han, and was even mentioned as a school of mathematics in and around 180 CE by Cai Yong.

=== Western translations ===
The title of the book has been translated in a wide variety of ways.

In 1852, Alexander Wylie referred to it as &quot;Arithmetical Rules of the Nine Sections.&quot;

With only a slight variation, the Japanese historian of mathematics Yoshio Mikami shortened the title to &quot;Arithmetic in Nine Sections&quot;.

David Eugene Smith, in his &quot;History of Mathematics (Smith 1923)&quot;, followed the convention used by Yoshio Mikami.

Several years later, George Sarton took note of the book, but only with limited attention and only mentioning the usage of red and black rods for positive and negative numbers.

In 1959, Joseph Needham and Wang Ling (historian) translated Jiu Zhang Suan shu as &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot; for the first time.

Later in 1994, Lam Lay Yong used this title in her overview of the book, as did other mathematicians including John N. Crossley and Anthony W.-C Lun in their translation of Li Yan and Du Shiran&#x27;s &quot;Chinese Mathematics: A Concise History&quot; (Li and Du 1987).

Afterwards, the name &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot; stuck and became the standard English title for the book.

==Table of contents==
Contents of &quot;The Nine Chapters&quot; are as follows:


== Major contributions ==

=== Real number system ===
&quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot; does not discuss natural numbers, that is, positive integers and their operations, but they are widely used and written on the basis of natural numbers. Although it is not a book on fractions, the meaning, nature, and four operations of fractions are fully discussed. For example: combined division (addition), subtraction (subtraction), multiplication (multiplication), warp division (division), division (comparison size), reduction (simplified fraction), and bisector (average).

The concept of negative numbers also appears in &quot;Nine Chapters of Arithmetic&quot;. In order to cooperate with the algorithm of equations, the rules of addition and subtraction of positive and negative numbers are given. The subtraction is &quot;divide by the same name, benefit by different names. The addition is &quot;divide by different names, benefit from each other by the same name. Among them, &quot;division&quot; is subtraction, &quot;benefit&quot; is addition, and &quot;no entry&quot; means that there is no counter-party, but multiplication and division are not recorded.

&quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot; gives a certain discussion on natural numbers, fractions, positive and negative numbers, and some special irrationality. Generally speaking, it has the prototype of the real number system used in modern mathematics.

=== Gou Gu (Pythagorean) Theorem ===
The geometric figures included in &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot; are mostly straight and circular figures because of its focus on the applications onto the agricultural fields. In addition, due to the needs of civil architecture, &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot; also discusses volumetric algorithms of linear and circular 3 dimensional solids. The arrangement of these volumetric algorithms ranges from simple to complex, forming a unique mathematical system.

Regarding the direct application of the Gou Gu Theorem, which is precisely the Chinese version of the Pythagorean Theorem, the book divides it into four main categories: Gou Gu mutual seeking, Gou Gu integer, Gou Gu dual capacity, Gou Gu similar.

Gou Gu mutual seeking discusses the algorithm of finding the length of a side of the right triangle while knowing the other two. Gou Gu integer is precisely the finding of some significant integer Pythagorean numbers, including famously the triple 3,4,5. Gou Gu dual capacity discusses algorithms for calculating the areas of the inscribed rectangles and other polygons in the circle, which also serves an algorithm to calculate the value of pi. Lastly, Gou Gu similars provide algorithms of calculating heights and lengths of buildings on the mathematical basis of similar right triangles.

=== Completing of squares and solutions of system of equations ===
The methods of completing the squares and cubes as well as solving simultaneous linear equations listed in &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot; can be regarded one of the major content of ancient Chinese mathematics. The discussion of these algorithms in &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot; are very detailed. Through these discussions, one can understand the achievements of the development of ancient Chinese mathematics.

Completing the squaring and cubes can not only solve systems of two linear equations with two unknowns, but also general quadratic and cubic equations. It is the basis for solving higher-order equations in ancient China, and it also plays an important role in the development of mathematics.

The &quot;equations&quot; discussed in the Fang Cheng chapter are equivalent to today&#x27;s simultaneous linear equations. The solution method called &quot;Fang Cheng Shi&quot; is best known today as Gaussian elimination. Among the eighteen problems listed in the Fang Cheng chapter, some are equivalent to simultaneous linear equations with two unknowns, some are equivalent to simultaneous linear equations with 3 unknowns, and the most complex example analyzes the solution to a system of linear equations with up to 5 unknowns.

== Significance ==
The word &quot;jiu&quot;, or &quot;9&quot;, means more than just a digit in ancient Chinese. In fact, since it is the largest digit, it often refers to something of a grand scale or a supreme authority. Further, the word &quot;zhang&quot;, or &quot;chapter&quot;, also has more connotations than simply being the &quot;chapter&quot;. It may refer to a section, several parts of an article, or an entire treatise.

In this light, many scholars of the history of Chinese mathematics compare the significance of &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot; on the development of Eastern mathematical traditions to that of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; on the Western mathematical traditions. However, the influence of &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot; stops short at the advancement of modern mathematics due to its focus on practical problems and inductive proof methods as opposed to the deductive, axiomatic tradition that Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; establishes. 

However, it is dismissive to say that &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot; has no impact at all on modern mathematics. The style and structure of &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot; can be best concluded as &quot;problem, formula, and computation&quot;. This process of solving applied mathematical problems can now be considered the standard approach in the field of applied mathematics.

<doc id="204223" wikidata="Q8017319" url="?curid=204223" title="William Radice">
<text>William Radice (1951 – 10 November 2024) was a British poet, writer and translator. His research area was in Bengali language and literature, and he was the senior lecturer in Bengali in the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London. He translated several Bengali works, and works by Rabindranath Tagore and Michael Madhusudan Dutt.

Radice adapted the text &quot;Debotar Grash&quot; by Rabindranath Tagore as an opera libretto, which was set to music by Param Vir as Snatched by the Gods. He wrote the libretto for a children&#x27;s opera &quot;Chincha-Chancha Cooroo&quot; or &quot;The Weaver&#x27;s Wedding&quot; with music by Bernard Hughes.

He published nine volumes of poetry ranging from &quot;Eight Sections&quot; (1974), &quot;Strivings&quot; (1980), &quot;Louring Skies&quot; (1985) and &quot;Gifts&quot; (2002) to his latest two books &quot;This Theatre Royal&quot; (2004) and &quot;Green, Red, Gold, a novel in 101 sonnets&quot; (2005) which were hailed by A. N. Wilson in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as stunning. He has also fore-worded a collection of translated Tagore poems, Soaring High, written by Mira Rani Devi.

In 2002, he published the voluminous (784 pages) &quot;Myths and Legends of India&quot;, a collection of 112 of his own retellings with selections from P. Lal&#x27;s ongoing transcreation of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Along with the major Hindu myths, he included legends and folk tales from Muslim, Buddhist, Jain, Syrian Christian and tribal sources.

His mother was the editor and translator Betty Radice. William Radice died from cancer in England, on 10 November 2024, at the age of 73.

<doc id="204225" wikidata="Q301597" url="?curid=204225" title="Bartolomeo Cristofori">
<text>Bartolomeo Cristofori di Francesco (; May 4, 1655 – January 27, 1731) was an Italian maker of musical instruments famous for inventing the piano.

==Life==
The available source materials on Cristofori&#x27;s life include his birth and death records, two wills, the bills he submitted to his employers, and a single interview carried out by Scipione Maffei. From the latter, both Maffei&#x27;s notes and the published journal article are preserved.

Cristofori was born in Padua in the Republic of Venice. Nothing is known of his early life. A tale is told that he served as an apprentice to the great violin maker Nicolò Amati, based on the appearance in a 1680 census record of a &quot;Christofaro Bartolomei&quot; living in Amati&#x27;s house in Cremona. However, as Stewart Pollens points out, this person cannot be Bartolomeo Cristofori, since the census records an age of 13, whereas Cristofori according to his baptismal record would have been 25 at the time. Pollens also gives strong reasons to doubt the authenticity of the cello and double bass instruments sometimes attributed to Cristofori.

Probably the most important event in Cristofori&#x27;s life is the first one of which we have any record: in 1688, at age 33, he was recruited to work for Prince Ferdinando de Medici. Ferdinando, a lover and patron of music, was the son and heir of Cosimo III, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Tuscany was at the time still a small independent state.

It is not known what led Ferdinando to recruit Cristofori. The Prince traveled to Venice in 1688 to attend the Carnival, so he may have met Cristofori passing through Padua on his way home. Ferdinando was looking for a new technician to take care of his many musical instruments, the previous incumbent having just died. However, it seems possible that the Prince wanted to hire Cristofori not just as his technician, but specifically as an innovator in musical instruments. It would be surprising if Cristofori at age 33 had not already shown the inventiveness for which he later became famous.

The evidence—all circumstantial—that Cristofori may have been hired as an inventor is as follows. According to Stewart Pollens, there were already several qualified individuals in Florence who could have filled the position; however, the Prince passed them over and paid Cristofori a higher salary than his predecessor. Moreover, Pollens notes, &quot;curiously, [among the many bills Cristofori submitted to his employer] there are no records of bills submitted for Cristofori&#x27;s pianofortes ... This could mean that Cristofori was expected to turn over the fruits of his experimentation to the court.&quot; Lastly, the Prince was evidently fascinated with machines (he collected over forty clocks, in addition to a great variety of elaborate musical instruments), and would thus be naturally interested in the elaborate mechanical action that was at the core of Cristofori&#x27;s work on the piano.

Maffei&#x27;s interview reports Cristofori&#x27;s memory of his conversation with the Prince at this time:

:&quot;che fu detto al Principe, che non volevo; rispos&#x27; egli il farò volere io.&quot;

which Giuliana Montanari (reference below) translates as:

:&quot;The prince was told that I did not wish to go; he replied that he would make me want to&quot;

This suggests that the Prince may have felt that Cristofori would be a prize recruit and was trying to charm him into accepting his offer; consistent again with the view that the Prince was attempting to recruit him as an inventor.

In any event, Cristofori agreed to the appointment, for a salary of 12 scudi per month. He moved rather quickly to Florence (May 1688; his job interview having taken place in March or April), was issued a house, complete with utensils and equipment, by the Grand Duke&#x27;s administration, and set to work. For the Prince, he tuned, maintained, and transported instruments; worked on his various inventions, and also did restoration work on valuable older harpsichords.

At this time, the Grand Dukes of Tuscany employed a large staff of about 100 artisans, who worked in the Galleria dei Lavori of the Uffizi. Cristofori&#x27;s initial work space was probably in this area, which did not please him. He later told Maffei:

:&quot;che da principio durava fatica ad andare nello stanzone in questo strepito&quot;

:&quot;It was hard for me to have to go into the big room with all that noise&quot; (tr. Montanari)

Cristofori did eventually obtain his own workshop, usually keeping one or two assistants working for him.

===Earlier instruments===
During the remaining years of the 17th century, Cristofori invented two keyboard instruments before he began his work on the piano. These instruments are documented in an inventory, dated 1700, of the many instruments kept by Prince Ferdinando. Stewart Pollens conjectures that this inventory was prepared by a court musician named Giovanni Fuga, who may have referred to it as his own in a 1716 letter.

The spinettone, Italian for &quot;big spinet&quot;, was a large, multi-choired spinet (a harpsichord in which the strings are slanted to save space), with disposition 1 × 8&#x27;, 1 × 4&#x27;; most spinets have the simple disposition 1 × 8&#x27;. This invention may have been meant to fit into a crowded orchestra pit for theatrical performances, while having the louder sound of a multi-choired instrument.

The other invention (1690) was the highly original oval spinet, a kind of virginal with the longest strings in the middle of the case.

Cristofori also built instruments of existing types, documented in the same 1700 inventory: a clavicytherium (upright harpsichord), and two harpsichords of the standard Italian 2 × 8&#x27; disposition; one of them has an unusual case made of ebony.

===The first appearance of the piano===
It was thought for some time that the earliest mention of the piano is from a diary of Francesco Mannucci, a Medici court musician, indicating that Cristofori was already working on the piano by 1698. However, the authenticity of this document is now doubted. The first unambiguous evidence for the piano comes from the 1700 inventory of the Medici mentioned in the preceding section. The entry in this inventory for Cristofori&#x27;s piano begins as follows:

:&quot;Un Arpicembalo di Bartolomeo Cristofori di nuova inventione, che fa&#x27; il piano, e il forte, a due registri principali unisoni, con fondo di cipresso senza rosa...&quot;&quot; (boldface added)

:&quot;An &quot;Arpicembalo&quot; by Bartolomeo Cristofori, of new invention that produces soft and loud, with two sets of strings at unison pitch, with soundboard of cypress without rose...&quot;&quot;

The term &quot;Arpicembalo&quot;, literally &quot;harp-harpsichord&quot;, was not generally familiar in Cristofori&#x27;s day. Edward Good infers that this is what Cristofori himself wanted his instrument to be called. Our own word for the piano, however, is the result of a gradual truncation over time of the words shown in boldface above.

The Medici inventory goes on to describe the instrument in considerable detail. The range of this (now lost) instrument was four octaves, C to c‴, a standard (if slightly small) compass for harpsichords.

Another document referring to the earliest piano is a marginal note made by one of the Medici court musicians, Federigo Meccoli, in a copy of the book &quot;Le Istitutioni harmoniche&quot; by Gioseffo Zarlino. Meccoli wrote:

:&quot;These are the ways in which it is possible to play the Arpicimbalo del piano e forte, invented by Master Bartolomeo Christofani of Padua in the year 1700, harpsichord maker to the Most Serene Grand Prince Ferdinand of Tuscany.&quot; (transl. Stewart Pollens)

According to Scipione Maffei&#x27;s journal article, by 1711 Cristofori had built three pianos. The Medici had given one to Cardinal Ottoboni in Rome, and two had been sold in Florence.

===Later life===
Cristofori&#x27;s patron, Prince Ferdinando, died at the age of 50 in 1713. There is evidence that Cristofori continued to work for the Medici court, still headed by the Prince&#x27;s father Cosimo III. Specifically, a 1716 inventory of the musical instrument collection is signed &quot;Bartolommeo Cristofori Custode&quot;, indicating that Cristofori had been given the title of custodian of the collection.

During the early 18th century, the prosperity of the Medici princes declined, and like many of the other Medici-employed craftsmen, Cristofori took to selling his work to others. The king of Portugal bought at least one of his instruments.

In 1726, the only known portrait of Cristofori was painted (see above). It portrays the inventor standing proudly next to what is almost certainly a piano. In his left hand is a piece of paper, believed to contain a diagram of Cristofori&#x27;s piano action. The portrait was destroyed in the Second World War, and only photographs of it remain.

Cristofori continued to make pianos until near the end of his life, continually making improvements in his invention. In his senior years, he was assisted by Giovanni Ferrini, who went on to have his own distinguished career, continuing his master&#x27;s tradition. There is tentative evidence that there was another assistant, P. Domenico Dal Mela, who went on in 1739 to build the first upright piano.

In his declining years Cristofori prepared two wills. The first, dated January 24, 1729, bequeathed all his tools to Giovanni Ferrini. The second will, dated March 23 of the same year, changes the provisions substantially, bequeathing almost all his possessions to the &quot;Dal Mela sisters ... in repayment for their continued assistance lent to him during his illnesses and indispositions, and also in the name of charity.&quot; This will left the small sum of five &quot;scudi&quot; to Ferrini. Pollens notes further evidence from the will that this reflected no falling out between Cristofori and Ferrini, but only Cristofori&#x27;s moral obligation to his caretakers. The inventor died on January 27, 1731, at the age of 75.

==Cristofori&#x27;s pianos==


The total number of pianos built by Cristofori is unknown. Only three survive today, all dating from the 1720s.

*A 1720 instrument is located in the Metropolitan Museum in New York. Later builders have extensively altered this instrument: the soundboard was replaced in 1938, and the 54-note range was shifted by about half an octave, from F&#x27;, G&#x27;, A&#x27;–c to C–f. Although this piano is playable, according to builder Denzil Wraight &quot;its original condition ... has been irretrievably lost,&quot; and it cannot indicate what it sounded like when new.
*A 1722 instrument is in the Museo Nazionale degli Strumenti Musicali in Rome. It has a range of four octaves (C-c³) and includes an &quot;una corda&quot; stop; see below. This piano has been damaged by worms and is not playable.
*A 1726 instrument is in the Musikinstrumenten-Museum of Leipzig University. Four octaves (C-c³) with &quot;una corda&quot; stop. This instrument is not currently playable, though in the past recordings were made.

The three surviving instruments all bear essentially the same Latin inscription: &quot;&quot;BARTHOLOMAEVS DE CHRISTOPHORIS PATAVINUS INVENTOR FACIEBAT FLORENTIAE [date]&quot;, where the date is rendered in Roman numerals. The meaning is &quot;Bartolomeo Cristofori of Padua, inventor, made [this] in Florence in [date].&quot;&quot;

===Design===
The piano as built by Cristofori in the 1720s boasted almost all of the features of the modern instrument. It differed in being of very light construction, lacking a metal frame; this meant that it could not produce an especially loud tone. This continued to be the rule for pianos until around 1820, when iron bracing was first introduced. Here are design details of Cristofori&#x27;s instruments:

====Action====
Piano actions are complex mechanical devices which impose very specific design requirements, virtually all of which were met by Cristofori&#x27;s action.

First, a piano action must be arranged so that a key press does not actually lift the hammer all the way to the string. If it did, the hammer would block on the string and damp its vibrations. The position of the sprung &#x27;hopper&#x27; or &#x27;jack&#x27; centred in the key of Cristofori&#x27;s action (see &quot;I&quot; in diagram below) is so adjusted that the hopper escapes from the &#x27;notch&#x27; in the middle of the intermediate lever (G) just before the hammer (C) strikes the string, so that the hammer is not driven all the way but travels the remaining distance under its own momentum and then falls into the check (M). When the key is allowed to return to its position of rest, the jack springs back under the notch and a repeated blow is possible. Although Cristofori&#x27;s design incorporates no specific device for repetition, the lightness of the action gives more facility for repetition than the heavier actions of the English type that developed in the first half of the 19th century, until these were provided with additions of one kind or another to facilitate repetition.

Second, a piano action must greatly amplify the motion of the player&#x27;s finger: in Cristofori&#x27;s action, an &quot;intermediate lever&quot; (G) was used to translate every key motion into a hammer motion eight times greater in magnitude. Cristofori&#x27;s multiple-lever design succeeded in providing the needed leverage in a small amount of space.

Third, after the hammer strikes the string, the action must avoid an unwanted second blow, which could easily result from the hammer bouncing up and down within the space confining it. In Cristofori&#x27;s action, this was accomplished by two means. By lifting the intermediate lever with a jack that disengages in its highest position, the Cristofori action made it possible for the hammer to fall (after its initial blow) to a position considerably lower than the highest position to which the key had lifted it. By itself, this mechanism greatly reduces the chance of an unwanted second blow. Also, the Cristofori action included a &quot;check&quot; (also called &quot;back check&quot;; M) that catches the hammer and holds it in a partially raised position until the player releases the key; the check also helped to prevent unwanted second blows.

The complexity of Cristofori&#x27;s action and hence the difficulty of building it may have formed a barrier to later builders, who appear to have tried to simplify it. However, Cristofori&#x27;s design ultimately won out; the standard modern piano action is a still more complex and evolved version of Cristofori&#x27;s original.

====Hammers====
The hammer heads in Cristofori&#x27;s mature pianos (A) are made of paper, curled into a circular coil and secured with glue, and surmounted by a strip of leather at the contact point with the string. According to harpsichord maker and scholar Denzil Wraight, such hammers have their origin in &quot;15th-century paper organ pipe technology&quot;. The purpose of the leather is presumably to make the hammers softer, thus emphasizing the lower harmonics of string vibration by maintaining a broad area of contact at impact. The same goal of softness was achieved in later 18th-century pianos by covering the wooden hammers with soft leather, and in mid-19th-century and later instruments by covering a wooden core with a thick layer of compressed felt.

As in modern pianos, the hammers are larger in the bass notes than in the treble.

====Frame====
Cristofori&#x27;s pianos use an internal frame member (bentside) to support the soundboard; in other words, the structural member attaching the right side of the soundboard is distinct from the external case that bears the tension of the strings. Cristofori also applied this system to harpsichords. The use of a separate support for the soundboard reflects Cristofori&#x27;s belief that the soundboard should not be subjected to compression from string tension. This may improve the sound, and also avoids the peril of warping—as harpsichord makers Kerstin Schwarz and Tony Chinnery point out , , a severely warped soundboard threatens a structural catastrophe, namely contact between strings and soundboard. Cristofori&#x27;s principle continues to be applied in modern pianos, where the now-enormous string tension (up to 20 tons) is borne by a separate iron frame (the &quot;plate&quot;).

Wraight has written that the three surviving Cristofori pianos appear to follow an orderly progression: each has heavier framing than its predecessor. Wraight suggests that this would have been intentional, in that the heavier framing permitted tenser, thicker strings. This in turn increased the volume with which treble notes could be played without pitch distortion, a limitation that Wraight observes when playing replica instruments. Thus, it appears that the move toward heavier framing, a trend that dominates the history of the piano, may already have begun in Cristofori&#x27;s own building practice.

====Inverted wrest plank====
On two of his surviving instruments, Cristofori employed an unusual arrangement of the tuning pins: they are inserted all the way through their supporting wrest plank. Thus, the tuning hammer is used on the top side of the wrest plank, but the strings are wrapped around the pins on the bottom side. This made it harder to replace broken strings, but it provided two compensating advantages. With the nut (front bridge) inverted as well, the blows of the hammers, coming from below, would seat the strings firmly into place, rather than threatening to displace them. The inverted wrestplank also placed the strings lower in the instrument, permitting smaller and lighter hammers, hence a lighter and more responsive touch.

According to musical instrument scholar Grant O&#x27;Brien, the inverted wrestplank is &quot;still to be found in pianos dating from a period 150 years after [Cristofori&#x27;s] death.&quot; In modern pianos, the same basic principle is followed: the contact point for the vibrating length of the string that is close to the hammers is either an agraffe or the capo d&#x27;astro bar; these devices pull the string in the direction opposite to the hammer blow, just as in Cristofori&#x27;s original arrangement.

====Soundboard====
Cristofori used cypress, the wood traditionally favored for soundboards in the Italian school of harpsichord making. Piano making after Cristofori&#x27;s time ultimately settled consistently on spruce as the best material for soundboards; however, Denzil Wraight has noted some compensating advantages for cypress.

====Strings====
In Cristofori&#x27;s pianos, there are two strings per note throughout the compass. Modern pianos use three strings in the mid and upper range, two in the upper bass, and one in the lower bass, with greater variation in thickness than Cristofori used. Cristofori&#x27;s strings are all equally spaced regardless of their pitch, rather than being grouped so that strings of identical pitch are closer together.

In two of the attested pianos, there is a forerunner of the modern soft pedal: the player can manually slide the entire action four millimeters to one side, so that the hammers strike just one of the two strings (&quot;una corda&quot;). It is possible however that this device was intended as an aid to tuning. In his combined harpsichord-piano, with two 8-foot strings for each note, Ferrini allowed one set of harpsichord jacks to be disengaged but did not provide a una corda device for the hammer action.

The strings may have been thicker than harpsichord strings of the same period, although there are no original string gauge markings on any of the three surviving pianos to prove this. Thicker strings are thought to be better suited to the hammer blows. Comparing the two 1726 instruments, one a piano, the other a harpsichord, the lengths of the 8-foot strings are almost the same, certainly in the upper halves of the compasses of the two instruments.

It is difficult to determine what metal the strings of Cristofori&#x27;s pianos were made of, since strings are replaced as they break, and sometimes restorers even replace the entire set of strings. According to Stewart Pollens, &quot;the earlier museum records document that all three [attested] Cristofori pianos were discovered with similar gauges of iron wire through much of the compass, and brass in the bass.&quot; The New York instrument was restrung entirely in brass in 1970; Pollens reports that with this modification the instrument cannot be tuned closer than a minor third below pitch without breaking strings. This may indicate that the original strings did indeed include iron ones; however, the breakage might also be blamed on the extensive rebuilding of this instrument, which changed its tonal range.

More recently, Denzil Wraight, Tony Chinnery, and Kerstin Schwarz, who have built replica Cristofori pianos, have taken the view that Cristofori favored brass strings, except occasionally in very demanding locations (such as the upper range of a 2&#x27; harpsichord stop). Chinnery suggests that &quot;cypress soundboards and brass strings go together: sweetness of sound rather than volume or brilliance.&quot;

===Sound===
According to Wraight, it is not straightforward to determine what Cristofori&#x27;s pianos sounded like, since the surviving instruments (see above) are either too decrepit to be played or have been extensively and irretrievably altered in later &quot;restorations&quot;. However, in recent decades, many modern builders have made Cristofori replicas, and their collective experience, and particularly the recordings made on these instruments, has created an emerging view concerning the Cristofori piano sound. The sound of the Cristofori replicas is as close to the harpsichord as it is to the modern piano; this is to be expected given that their case construction and stringing are much closer to the harpsichord than to the piano. The note onsets are not as sharply defined as in a harpsichord, and the response of the instrument to the player&#x27;s varying touch is clearly noticeable.

Some Cristofori instruments—both restored and replicated—may be heard in the external links below.

===Initial reception of the piano===
Knowledge of how Cristofori&#x27;s invention was initially received comes in part from the article published in 1711 by Scipione Maffei, an influential literary figure, in the &quot;Giornale de&#x27;letterati d&#x27;Italia&quot; of Venice. Maffei said that &quot;some professionals have not given this invention all the applause it merits,&quot; and goes on to say that its sound was felt to be too &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;dull&quot;—Cristofori was unable to make his instrument as loud as the competing harpsichord. Yet Maffei himself was an enthusiast for the piano, and the instrument did gradually catch on and increase in popularity, in part due to Maffei&#x27;s efforts.

One reason why the piano spread slowly at first was that it was quite expensive to make, and thus was purchased only by royalty and a few wealthy private individuals. The ultimate success of Cristofori&#x27;s invention occurred only in the 1760s, when the invention of cheaper square pianos, along with generally greater prosperity, made it possible for many people to acquire one.

Subsequent technological developments in the piano were often mere &quot;re-inventions&quot; of Cristofori&#x27;s work; in the early years, there were perhaps as many regressions as advances.

==Surviving instruments==
Nine instruments that survive today are attributed to Cristofori:

*The three pianos described above.
*Two oval spinets, from 1690 and 1693. The 1690 instrument is kept in the Museo degli strumenti musicali, part of the Galleria del Accademia in Florence. The 1693 oval spinet is in the Musikinstrumenten-Museum of the University of Leipzig.
*A spinettone, also in the Leipzig museum.
*An early (17th century) harpsichord, with a case made of ebony. It is kept in the Museo degli strumenti musicali in Florence (part of the Galleria dell&#x27;Accademia). An image can be viewed at the website of harpsichord builder Tony Chinnery.
*A harpsichord dated 1722, in the Leipzig museum.
*A 1726 harpsichord, in the Leipzig museum. It has the disposition 1 × 8&#x27;, 1 × 4&#x27;, 1 × 2&#x27; and is the only known Italian harpsichord with a two-foot stop. The instrument illustrates Cristofori&#x27;s ingenuity in the large number of levers and extensions that permit the player great flexibility in determining which strings will sound. There are six basic registrations: 8&#x27;, 8&#x27; + 4&#x27;, 4&#x27;, 4&#x27; + 2&#x27;, 2&#x27;, 8&#x27; + 4&#x27; + 2&#x27;; in addition, the player may add 4&#x27;, 2&#x27; or 4&#x27; + 2&#x27; to the 8&#x27; stop just in notes of the bass range.

The later instruments, dating from Cristofori&#x27;s old age, probably include work by assistant Giovanni Ferrini, who went on after the inventor&#x27;s death to build pianos of wider range using the same basic design.

An apparent remnant harpsichord, lacking soundboard, keyboard, and action, is currently the property of the noted builder Tony Chinnery, who acquired it at an auction in New York. This instrument passed through the shop of the late 19th century builder/fraudster Leopoldo Franciolini, who reworked it with his characteristic form of decoration, but according to Chinnery &quot;there are enough construction details to identify it definitely as the work of Cristofori&quot;.

There are also several fraudulent instruments attributed to Cristofori, notably a three-manual harpsichord once displayed in the Deutsches Museum in Munich; this was a rebuilding by Franciolini of a single-manual instrument made in 1658 by Girolamo Zenti.

==Assessments of Cristofori==
Cristofori was evidently admired and respected in his own lifetime for his work on the piano. On his death, a theorbo player at the Medici court named Niccolò Susier wrote in his diary:

:&quot;1731, 27th [January], Bartolomeo Crisofani , called Bartolo Padovano, died, famous instrument maker to the Most Serene Grand Prince Ferdinando of fond memory, and he was a skillful maker of keyboard instruments, and also the inventor of the pianoforte, that is known through all Europe, and who served His Majesty the King of Portugal [João V], who paid two hundred gold &quot;louis d&#x27;or&quot; for the said instruments, and he died, as has been said, at the age of eighty-one years.&quot; [trans. Stewart Pollens; Cristofori was actually only 76 at his death]

An anonymous 18th-century music dictionary, found in the library of the composer Padre G. B. Martini, says of him

:&quot;Christofori Bartolomeo of Padua died in Florence [...] was the famous harpsichord maker, a distinguished restorer rendering even better good instruments made by other past masters and he was also the inventor of harpsichords with hammers, which produce a different quality of sound both on account of the hammer striking the chord and the completely different internal structure of the body of the instrument, not visible from the outside [...] the best instruments that he made were for Ferdinando de&#x27; Medici Great Prince of Tuscany, his protector and son of the Grand Duke Cosimo III.&quot; [trans. Giuliana Montanari]

After his death, however, Cristofori&#x27;s reputation went into decline. As Stewart Pollens has documented, in late 18th century France it was believed that the piano had been invented not by Cristofori but by the German builder Gottfried Silbermann. Silbermann was in fact an important figure in the history of the piano, but his instruments relied almost entirely on Cristofori for the design of their hammer actions. Later scholarship (notably by Leo Puliti) only gradually corrected this error.

In the second half of the 20th century, Cristofori&#x27;s instruments were studied with care, as part of the general increase in interest in early instruments that developed in this era (see authentic performance). The modern scholars who have studied Cristofori&#x27;s work in detail tend to express their admiration in the strongest terms; thus the New Grove encyclopedia describes him as having possessed &quot;tremendous ingenuity&quot;; Stewart Pollens says &quot;All of Cristofori&#x27;s work is startling in its ingenuity&quot;; and the early-instrument scholar Grant O&#x27;Brien has written
&quot;The workmanship and inventiveness displayed by the instruments of Cristofori are of the highest order and his genius has probably never been surpassed by any other keyboard maker of the historical period ... I place Cristofori shoulder to shoulder with Antonio Stradivarius.&quot;

Cristofori is also given credit for originality in inventing the piano. While it is true that there had been earlier, crude attempts to make piano-like instruments, it is not clear that these were even known to Cristofori. The piano is thus an unusual case in which an important invention can be ascribed unambiguously to a single individual, who brought it to an unusual degree of perfection all on his own.

<text>Palembang (, Palembang: &quot;Pelémbang&quot;, Jawi: ) is the capital city of the Indonesian province of South Sumatra. The city proper covers on both banks of the Musi River in the eastern lowlands of southern Sumatra. It had a population of 1,668,848 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 1,772,492 (comprising 887,101 males and 885,391 females). Palembang is the second most populous city in Sumatra, after Medan, and the twelfth most populous city in Indonesia.

The Palembang metropolitan area has an estimated population of more than 2.7 million in 2023. It comprises the city and parts of regencies surrounding the city, including Banyuasin Regency (11 administrative districts), Ogan Ilir Regency (7 districts), and Ogan Komering Ilir Regency (4 districts).

Palembang was the capital of Srivijaya, a Buddhist kingdom that ruled much of the western Indonesian Archipelago and controlled many maritime trade routes, including the Strait of Malacca.

Palembang was incorporated into the Dutch East Indies in 1825 after the abolition of the Palembang Sultanate. It was chartered as a city on 1 April 1906.

Palembang was the host city of the 2011 Southeast Asian Games and the 2018 Asian Games along with Jakarta. The first light rail system in Indonesia was operated in Palembang in July 2018.

The city attracted 2,011,417 tourists in 2017, including 9,850 foreign tourists. Traffic jams, floods, slums, pollution, and peatland fire are problems in Palembang.

== Etymology ==
Some believe that the name &quot;Palembang&quot; is derived from the word &quot;limbang&quot; in Malay. By adding the prefix &quot;pe-&quot; which indicates a place or situation, the city&#x27;s name means &quot;a place to pan gold and diamond ores&quot;. It is said that during antiquity, the ruler ordered gold and diamond miners to pan their ores in the city for security and surveillance reasons.

Others say that the name comes from the word &quot;lembang&quot; in Malay. By adding the same prefix, the city&#x27;s name means &quot;a place where the water leaks&quot;. It also means &quot;a place which was constantly inundated by water&quot;. It refers to the geographical features of Palembang, which is a wetland.

Some say that the name was given by four brothers who survived a shipwreck near Musi River during the Majapahit reign. It is said that on their way to a new colony in eastern Sumatra when their ship was wrecked, all belongings in the ship sunk into the sea except a broken wooden box which the survivor used as rafts. The rafts were wobbled (&quot;limbang-limbang&quot;) by the waves until they drifted ashore to a land which was later named &quot;Palimbang&quot; by them.

Palembang also has a special Chinese character rendition like several cities in Indonesia. In modern Chinese, Palembang is written as &quot;Jùgǎng&quot; (). here is a sound-borrowing at Hokkien. Palembang is called &quot;Kū-káng&quot; () in Hokkien, meaning &quot;Old Port&quot;; is read as &quot;kū&quot; in certain dominant dialects of Hokkien and was thus borrowed to use in place of .

== History ==
=== Srivijaya period ===
The Kedukan Bukit Inscription, which is dated 682 AD, is the oldest inscription found in Palembang. The inscription tells of a king who acquires magical powers and leads a large military force over water and land, setting out from Tamvan delta, arriving at a place called &quot;Matajap,&quot; and (in the interpretation of some scholars) founding the polity of Srivijaya. The &quot;Matajap&quot; of the inscription is believed to be Mukha Upang, a district of Palembang.

According to George Coedes, &quot;in the second half of the 9th century Java and Sumatra were united under the rule of a Sailendra reigning in Java...its centre at Palembang.&quot;

As the capital of the Srivijaya kingdom, this second oldest city in Southeast Asia has been an important trading centre in maritime Southeast Asia for more than a millennium. The kingdom flourished by controlling the international trade through the Strait of Malacca from the seventh to thirteenth century, establishing hegemony over polities in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. Sanskrit inscriptions and Chinese travelogues report that the kingdom prospered as an intermediary in the international trade between China and India. Because of the Monsoon, or biannual seasonal wind, after getting to Srivijaya, traders from China or India had to stay there for several months waiting the direction of the wind changes, or had to go back to China or India. Thus, Srivijaya grew to be the biggest international trade centre, and not only the market, but also infrastructures for traders such as lodging and entertainment also developed. It functioned as a cultural centre as well. Yijing, a Chinese Buddhist pilgrim who stayed in today&#x27;s Palembang and Jambi in 671, recorded that there were more than a thousand Buddhist monks and learned scholars, sponsored by the kingdom to study religion in Palembang. He also recorded that there were many &quot;states&quot; under the kingdom called Srivijaya (Shili Foshi).

In 990, an army from the Kingdom of Mataram in Java attacked Srivijaya. Palembang was sacked and the palace was looted. Cudamani Warmadewa, however, requested protection from China. By 1006, the invasion was finally repelled. In retaliation, Srivijaya king sent his troops to assist King Wurawari of Luaram in his revolt against Mataram. In subsequent battles, Mataram Palace was destroyed and the royal family of Mataram executed.

In 1068, King Virarajendra Chola of the Chola Dynasty of India conquered what is now Kedah from Srivijaya. Having lost many soldiers in the war and with its coffers almost empty due to the twenty-year disruption of trade, the reach of Srivijaya was diminished. Its territories began to free themselves from the suzerainty of Palembang and to establish many small kingdoms all over the former empire. Srivijaya finally declined with the military expedition by Javanese kingdoms in the thirteenth century.

=== Post-Srivijaya period ===
Prince Parameswara fled from Palembang after being crushed by Javanese forces. The city was then plagued by pirates, notably Chen Zuyi and Liang Daoming. In 1407, Chen was confronted at Palembang by the returning imperial treasure fleet under Admiral Zheng He. Zheng made the opening gambit, demanding Chen&#x27;s surrender and the pirate quickly signalled agreement while preparing for a surprise pre-emptive strike. But details of his plan had been provided to Zheng by a local Chinese informant, and in the fierce battle that ensued, the Ming soldiers and Ming superior armada finally destroyed the pirate fleet and killed 5,000 of its men. Chen was captured and held for public execution in Nanjing in 1407. Peace was finally restored to the Strait of Malacca as Shi Jinqing was installed as Palembang&#x27;s new ruler and incorporated into what would become a far-flung system of allies who acknowledged Ming supremacy in return for diplomatic recognition, military protection, and trading rights.

=== Palembang Sultanate ===
After the Demak Sultanate fell under Kingdom of Pajang, a Demak nobleman, Geding Suro with his followers fled to Palembang and established a new dynasty. It is from this period, that Islam became the dominant religion in Palembang. The Sultanate of Palembang was proclaimed in 1659. The Grand Mosque of Palembang was built in 1738 under the reign of Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin I Jaya Wikrama, and was completed in 1748. Settlements grew along the Musi River, with some houses built on rafts. The Sultanate legislated only citizens of Palembang could reside downstream of Seberang Ilir where the palace was located, whereas non-citizens were required to reside on the opposite bank known as Seberang Ulu.

Several local rivals, such as Banten, Jambi, and Aceh threatened the existence of the Sultanate. The Dutch East India Company established a trade post in Palembang in 1619. In 1642, the company obtained monopoly over the ports pepper trade. Tensions mounted between the Dutch and locals, peaking in 1657 when a Dutch ship was attacked in Palembang. This provided opportunity for the company to launch a punitive expedition in 1659, in which the city was burnt to the ground.

During the Napoleonic Wars in 1812, Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II repudiated British claims to suzerainty. The British responded by mounting a military expedition that captured Palembang and deposed the sultan. His younger brother, the pro-British Najamudinn, was installed onto the throne instead. The Dutch colonial government attempted to recover their influence at the court in 1816, but Sultan Najamuddin was uncooperative. An expedition launched by the Dutch in 1818 captured Sultan Najamudin and he was exiled to Batavia. A Dutch Army garrison was established in 1821, but Najamuddin attempted an attack and a mass poisoning of the garrison, which was intervened by the Dutch. Mahmud Badaruddin II was exiled to Ternate, and his palace was burned to the ground. The Sultanate was later abolished by the Dutch and direct colonial rule was established.

=== Dutch colonial period ===

Following the Dutch abolition of the Palembang Sultanate in 1825, Palembang became the capital of the Residency of Palembang, encompassing the territory that would become the South Sumatra province after Indonesian independence. Its first resident was Jan Izaäk van Sevenhoven.

From the late nineteenth century, with the Dutch introduction of new export crops including robusta coffee, Palembang rose as an economic centre. During the early 20th century, the development of the petroleum and rubber industries in Palembang Residency drove the city&#x27;s economic growth. This saw a growth in migrants, an increase in urbanisation, and development of the socioeconomic infrastructure. Palembang became the most populous urban centre outside Java.

=== Japanese occupation ===
An oil embargo had been imposed on Japan by the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, and due to its oil refineries, Palembang was a high priority objective for Japanese forces. With the area&#x27;s fuel supply and airfield, Palembang offered potential as a military base area, to both the Allies and the Japanese.

The main battle occurred during 13–16 February 1942. While the Allied planes were attacking Japanese shipping on 13 February, Kawasaki Ki-56 transport planes of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd &quot;Chutai&quot;, Imperial Japanese Army Air Force (IJAAF), dropped Teishin Shudan (Raiding Group) paratroopers over Pangkalan Benteng airfield. At the same time Mitsubishi Ki-21 bombers from the 98th &quot;Sentai&quot; dropped supplies for paratroopers. The formation was escorted by a large force of Nakajima Ki-43 fighters from the 59th and 64th &quot;Sentai&quot;. As many as 180 men from the Japanese 2nd Parachute Regiment, under Colonel Seiichi Kume, dropped between Palembang and Pangkalan Benteng, and more than 90 men came down west of the refineries at Plaju.

Although the Japanese paratroopers failed to capture the Pangkalan Benteng airfield, they managed to gain undamaged possession of the Plaju oil refinery. However, the second oil refinery in Sungai Gerong was demolished by the Allies. A counter-attack by &quot;Landstorm&quot; troops and anti-aircraft gunners from Prabumulih managed to retake the complex but took heavy losses. The planned demolition failed to do any serious damage to the refinery, but the oil stores were set ablaze. Two hours after the first drop, another 60 Japanese paratroopers were dropped near Pangkalan Benteng airfield.

As the Japanese landing force approached Sumatra, the remaining Allied aircraft attacked it, and the Japanese transport ship &quot;Otawa Maru&quot; was sunk. Hurricanes flew up the rivers, machine-gunning Japanese landing craft. However, on the afternoon of 15 February, all Allied aircraft were ordered to Java, where a major Japanese attack was anticipated, and the Allied air units had withdrawn from southern Sumatra by the evening of 16 February 1942. Other personnel were evacuated via Oosthaven (now Bandar Lampung) by ships to Java or India.

The Japanese managed to restore production at both main refineries, and these petroleum products were significant in their war effort. Despite Allied air raids, production was largely maintained. The city was defended from air attacks by the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s Palembang Defense Unit.

In August 1944, USAAF B-29 bombers flying from India, raided the Palembang refineries in what was the longest range regular bombing mission of the war.

In January 1945, in Operation Meridian I and II, the British Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm launched two major attacks on the two refinery complexes, against determined Japanese defence. The aviation fuel output was reduced by 75% for the loss of 32 aircraft to combat and landings.

=== National revolution ===
On 8 October 1945, the Resident of South Sumatra, Adnan Kapau Gani, and &quot;Gunseibu&quot; officers raised the Indonesian flag during a ceremony. It was declared that Palembang Residency was under control of Republicans.

Palembang was occupied by the Dutch after an urban battle with Republicans on 1–5 January 1947, which is nicknamed &quot;Pertempuran Lima Hari Lima Malam&quot; (Five Days and Nights Battle). The battle ended with a ceasefire and the Republican forces retreated as far as from Palembang.

During the occupation, the Dutch formed the federal state of South Sumatra in September 1948. After the transfer of sovereignty on 27 December 1949, South Sumatra State, along with other federal states and the Republic formed a short-lived United States of Indonesia before the states were abolished and integrated back into the form of Republic on 17 August 1950.

=== Old Order and New Order period ===
During PRRI/Permesta rebellion, the rebel faction established &quot;Dewan Garuda&quot; (Garuda Council) in South Sumatra on 15 January 1957 under Lieutenant Colonel Barlian took over the local government of South Sumatra.

In April 1962, Indonesian government started the construction of Ampera Bridge which was completed and officially opened for public on 30 September 1965 by Minister/Commander of the Army Lieutenant General Ahmad Yani on 30 September 1965, only hours before he was killed by troops belonging to the 30 September Movement. At first, the bridge was known as the Bung Karno Bridge, after the president, but following his fall, it was renamed the Ampera Bridge. A second bridge in Palembang which crosses Musi River, Musi II Bridge was built on 4 August 1992.

On 6 December 1988, Indonesia government expanded Palembang&#x27;s administrative area as far as 12 kilometers from the city center, with 9 villages from Musi Banyuasin integrated into 2 new districts of Palembang and 1 village from Ogan Komering Ilir integrated into Seberang Ulu I District.

During May 1998 riots of Indonesia, Palembang was also ravaged by riots with 10 burned shops, more than a dozen burned cars, and several injured people inflicted by rioters as students marching to the Provincial People&#x27;s Representative Council office of South Sumatra. Thousands of police and soldiers were put on guard at various points in the city. The Volunteer Team for Humanity (Indonesian: &quot;Tim Relawan untuk Manusia&quot;, or TRUK) reported that cases of sexual assault also took place.

=== Reform period ===
A sports complex, including Gelora Sriwijaya Stadium, was built in Palembang&#x27;s southern district of Jakabaring over 1998-2004. Palembang then hosted the 2004 National Games, 47 years after the games were last held outside Java and 51 years since held in Sumatra. Palembang went on to co-host the 2011 Southeast Asian Games with Jakarta. Two years later, Palembang replaced Riau province&#x27;s capital Pekanbaru as host city of the 2013 Islamic Solidarity Games after Riau Governor Rusli Zainal was implicated in a corruption case. Palembang and Jakarta co-hosted the 2018 Asian Games.

President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in 2005 declared Palembang a &quot;Water Tourism City&quot;. Further tourism promotions were launched by Yudhoyono&#x27;s administration in 2008 amid criticism that souvenirs promoting local culture for the campaign were actually imported from China.

Palembang&#x27;s first flyover was completed at Simpang Polda in September 2008. A second flyover, in Jakabaring, was completed in 2015. In 2010, Palembang launched its bus transit system, Transmusi. In 2015, the central government began upgrading Palembang&#x27;s transportation with the construction of a light rail transit system from Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II International Airport to Jakabaring, followed by toll roads, two Musi River bridges, and two flyovers, ahead of the 2018 Asian Games. The city&#x27;s main toll road commenced operation in October 2017.

== Geography and climate ==
=== Geography ===
At , Palembang occupies 400.61 km2 of vast lowland area east of Bukit Barisan Mountains in southern Sumatra with average elevation of , approximately from nearby coast at Bangka Strait. One of the largest rivers in Sumatra, the Musi River, runs through the city, dividing the city area into two major parts which are Seberang Ilir in the north (comprising 13 of the 18 city districts) and Seberang Ulu in the south (comprising Seberang Ulu Satu, Kertapati, Jakabaring, Seberang Ulu Dua and Plaju Districts). Palembang is also located on the confluence of two major tributaries of Musi River, which are Ogan River and Komering River. The river&#x27;s water level is influenced by tidal cycle. In rainy season, many areas on the city are inundated by the river&#x27;s tide.

Palembang&#x27;s topography is quite different between the Seberang Ilir and Seberang Ulu areas. Seberang Ulu&#x27;s topography is relatively flat. Seberang Ilir&#x27;s topography is more rugged with altitude variation between .

=== Climate ===
Palembang is located in the tropical rainforest climate (Köppen &quot;Af&quot;) zone with significant rainfall even in its driest months. The climate in Palembang is often described as a &quot;hot, humid climate with a lot of rainfall throughout the year&quot;. The annual average temperature is around . Within this tropical climate, except for precipitation and monsoonal wind direction, the city experiences no other seasonal change throughout the year. Average rainfall annually is . During its wettest months, the city&#x27;s lowlands are frequently inundated by torrential rains. However, in its driest months, many peatlands around the city dried, making them more vulnerable to wildfires, causing prolonged haze in the city. Due to the city&#x27;s very low latitude, the typhoon risk of the city is nearly absent.

=== Neighborhoods ===
Palembang is roughly divided by Musi River into two major areas known as Seberang Ilir (lit. &quot;downstream bank&quot;) in the north and Seberang Ulu (lit. &quot;upstream bank&quot;) in the south. Seberang Ilir is the main economic and political centre in Palembang and contained a prominent portion of the city&#x27;s highrises. Seberang Ulu is undergoing massive development, especially in Jakabaring, with the construction of business centre, government building, and the most notably is the construction of the city&#x27;s sport complex, Jakabaring Sport City.

== Administration ==

=== Government ===
Palembang administratively has a status as a city and has its own local government and legislative body. The executive head of Palembang is the Mayor. The mayor and members of representatives are locally elected by popular vote for a five-year term. The city government enjoys greater decentralization of affairs than the provincial body, such as the provision of public schools, public health facilities and public transportation. Current Mayor of the city is Harnojoyo, previous vice mayor who is appointed because the previous mayor, Romi Herton was impeached because of a bribery scandal during his election. Besides Mayor and Vice Mayor, there is the Palembang City Regional House of Representatives, which is a legislative body of 50 council members directly elected by the people in legislative elections every five years.

=== Administrative districts ===
Palembang consists of eighteen &quot;kecamatan&quot; (districts), each headed by a &quot;Camat.&quot; They are further divided again into 107 &quot;kelurahan&quot; (urban villages). They are listed below with their areas, their populations at the 2010 and 2020 Censuses, and the latest official estimates (as at mid 2023). The table also includes the numbers of &quot;kelurahan&quot; (urban villages) in each district, and its postal codes.

Note: (a) Two additional districts - Ilir Timur Tiga (East Ilir III) and Jakabaring - were established in 2017 by splitting from Ilir Timur Dua (East Ilir II) and Seberang Ulu Satu (Upper Seberang I) districts respectively; their populations at the 2010 Census are included in the figures given for the districts from which they were cut out.

Note the affixes can be translated as: &quot;Satu&quot; = &quot;One&quot;; &quot;Dua&quot; = &quot;Two&quot;; &quot;Tiga&quot; = &quot;Three&quot;; &quot;Timur&quot; = &quot;East&quot;; &quot;Barat&quot; = &quot;West&quot;; &quot;Ilir&quot; = &quot;Lower&quot; (or &quot;Downriver&quot;); &quot;Ulu&quot; - &quot;Upper&quot; (or &quot;Upriver&quot;).

== Demography ==
=== Ethnicity and language ===
Palembang is an ethnically diverse city. The indigenous population in the region of Palembang are Palembang people. Many of them live in traditional settlements along the Musi River bank, although there has been a recent efflux of Palembang people to the outer suburbs. Many people of other ethnicities from other parts of South Sumatra and beyond also live in Palembang. There are also significant Javanese, Minangkabau, Arab, Indian and Chinese communities who are inhabitants of Palembang. Arab Indonesian communities mainly live in several villages such as Kampong Al Munawwar in 13 Ulu, Kampong Assegaf in 16 Ulu, Kampong Al Habsyi in Kuto Batu, Kampong Jamalullail in 19 Ilir and Kampong Alawiyyin in Sungai Bayas, 10 Ilir. Conversely, Chinese Indonesian communities mainly live in commercial districts in Palembang although there are several traditional Chinese villages like Kampong Kapitan in 7 Ulu. And Indian in 18 Ilir.

The locally widespread Palembang language () is considered a Malayic variety in the Musi cluster with a significant Javanese influence. The natives originating from other parts of South Sumatra have their own regional languages, such as the Musi (Sekayu, Kelingi, Penukal dialects), Rawas, Penesak, and Pegagan varieties of the Musi cluster; the South Barisan Malayic varieties of Besemah, Lintang, Ogan, and Semende; and the Lampungic variety of Komering. Chinese languages are also largely used by local Chinese communities.

=== Religion ===
Palembang officially recognizes six religious faiths, of which the most widely held is Islam. According to the 2017 data from Badan Pusat Statistik Palembang, the population of Palembang was 92.22% Muslim, 3.91% Buddhist, 2.23% Protestant, 1.49% Roman Catholic, 0.13% Hindu, and 0.02% Confucianist. Muslims in Palembang are mainly from the Shafi`i school of Sunni Islam. There are several mosques with considerable heritage and historical significance, chiefly the Great Mosque of Palembang, which was built during the Palembang Sultanate era, widely regarded as the main mosque of Palembang.

== Transportation ==
Before the operation of Ampera Bridge, there were more people in Palembang using water transportation. Large water vehicles such as river steamboat was used to transport people to and from inland. Some people also used smaller boats such as the Kajang boat, a traditional boat with simple roof to carry people and goods. Nowadays, people in Palembang prefer road transportation over water, and private transportation over public. Traffic jams often occur in some main streets, especially during rush hour. Rail and air transportation are also available in Palembang.

<text>A quarry is a type of open-pit mine in which dimension stone, rock, construction aggregate, riprap, sand, gravel, or slate is excavated from the ground. The operation of quarries is regulated in some jurisdictions to manage their safety risks and reduce their environmental impact.

The word &quot;quarry&quot; can also include the underground quarrying for stone, such as Bath stone.

==History==
For thousands of years, only hand tools had been used in quarries. In the eighteenth century, the use of drilling and blasting operations was mastered.

==Types of rock==
Types of rock extracted from quarries include:
*Chalk
*China clay
*Cinder
*Clay
*Coal
*Construction aggregate (sand and gravel)
*Coquina
*Diabase
*Gabbro
*Granite
*Gritstone
*Gypsum
*Limestone
*Marble
*Ores
*Phosphate rock
*Quartz
*Sandstone
*Slate
*Travertine


==Methods of quarrying==

The method of removal of stones from their natural bed by using different operations is called quarrying. Methods of quarrying include:
*a) Digging – This method is used when the quarry consists of small and soft pieces of stones. 
*b) Heating – This method is used when the natural rock bed is horizontal and small in thickness. 
*c) Wedging –This method is used when the hard rock consists of natural fissure. When natural fissures are absent then artificial fissures are prepared by drilling holes. 
*d) Blasting – It is the process of removal of stones with the help of controlled explosives is filled in the holes of the stones. Line of least resistance plays very important role in the blasting process.

Following steps are used in the blasting process; 
*1) Drilling holes – Blast holes are drilled by using drilling machines. 
*2) Charging – Explosive powders are fed into the cleaned &amp; dried blast holes. 
*3) Tamping – The remaining portion of the blast holes are filled by clay, ash, fuse and wirings.
*4) Firing –The fuses of blasting holes are fired by using electrical power supply or match sticks.

==Slabs==
Many quarry stones such as marble, granite, limestone, and sandstone are cut into larger slabs and removed from the quarry. The surfaces are polished and finished with varying degrees of sheen or luster. Polished slabs are often cut into tiles or countertops and installed in many kinds of residential and commercial properties. Natural stone quarried from the earth is often considered a luxury and tends to be a highly durable surface, thus highly desirable.

==Problems==

Quarries in level areas with shallow groundwater or which are located close to surface water often have engineering problems with drainage. Generally the water is removed by pumping while the quarry is operational, but for high inflows more complex approaches may be required. For example, the Coquina quarry is excavated to more than below sea level.

To reduce surface leakage, a moat lined with clay was constructed around the entire quarry. Groundwater entering the pit is pumped up into the moat. As a quarry becomes deeper, water inflows generally increase and it also becomes more expensive to lift the water higher during removal; this can become the limiting factor in quarry depth. Some water-filled quarries are worked from beneath the water, by dredging.

Many people and municipalities consider quarries to be eyesores and require various abatement methods to address problems with noise, dust, and appearance. One of the more effective and famous examples of successful quarry restoration is Butchart Gardens in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.

A further problem is pollution of roads from trucks leaving the quarries. To control and restrain the pollution of public roads, wheel washing systems are becoming more common.

===Quarry lakes===

Many quarries naturally fill with water after abandonment and become lakes. Others are made into landfills.

Water-filled quarries can be very deep, often or more, and surprisingly cold, so swimming in quarry lakes is generally not recommended. Unexpectedly cold water can cause a swimmer&#x27;s muscles to suddenly weaken; it can also cause shock and even hypothermia. Though quarry water is often very clear, submerged quarry stones, abandoned equipment, dead animals and strong currents make diving into these quarries extremely dangerous. Several people drown in quarries each year. However, many inactive quarries are converted into safe swimming sites.

Such lakes, even lakes within active quarries, can provide important habitat for animals.

<text>Macrolife: A Mobile Utopia is a 1979 science fiction novel by American author George Zebrowski.

==Plot introduction==
By 2021, Earth&#x27;s nations are at (relative) peace, and even the erstwhile poorer nations are beginning to enjoy stable political and economic regimes. The invention of a super-strong material named &quot;Bulerite&quot; is partially responsible for this, which enables Earth to, at last, initiate a burgeoning space industry. However, events unfold which result in the first &quot;Macrolife&quot; colony leaving the solar system for the nearer stars.

==Explanation of the novel&#x27;s title==
Scientist Dandridge M. Cole originated the term &quot;Macro Life&quot; in his 1961 book &quot;The Ultimate Human Society&quot;, though the idea of using asteroids as mobile &quot;societal containers&quot; is a common theme in science, and science fiction.

Cole defined &quot;Macro Life&quot; as &quot;life squared per cell&quot;, i.e. &quot;Macro Life is to man what man is to the cell&quot;. Zebrowski, in the novel, regards Macrolife as an open-ended, expansive union of organic, cybernetic and machine intelligences (human and alien) with spacefaring as its means of dissemination.

==Plot summary==

The novel is split into three main sections.

(I) Sunspace: 2021 ... The &quot;Bulero&quot; family/corporation, inventors and marketers of &quot;Bulerite&quot; which is used to build the huge cities which house the Earth&#x27;s (and colonies) teeming millions, are at the pinnacle of their influence and wealth. Unfortunately, it is discovered - too late - that the substance is inherently flawed, in that after a time it destabilizes and self-destructs with spectacular results. Gradually, all the Bulerite on Earth, and that on and in the space colonies throughout the solar system becomes unstable, causing destruction and megadeath.

The devastation precipitates a war with Earth&#x27;s colonies on the outer planets, with whom a struggle for control of the solar system existed. Many nuclear-tipped missiles explode on Earth which adds to the Bulerite destabilization. The combination of the Bulerite and the nuclear explosions cause a mysterious shroud of radiation to envelop the Earth. All humans on the planet are assumed dead.

Before this final devastation, many refugees manage to escape to the Moon, Mars, and &quot;Asterome&quot;, an orbiting colony situated inside a hollowed-out asteroid at the Moon&#x27;s L5 point. Included amongst the refugees are most of Bulero family who end up on Asterome.

The leadership of Asterome are now faced with several severe challenges: Handling the influx of refugees, removing any Bulerite used in the construction of Asterome, consolidating their resources now that the Earth can no longer supply them with finished goods, and preventing increasingly aggressive attempts by the outer colonies and remnants of Earth&#x27;s government to take control and plunder Asterome.

When a means of providing Asterome with propulsion is discovered, the leadership of Asterome decide that leaving the solar system is the best option available to ensure Asterome&#x27;s short-term survival as well as proving a way for Mankind to survive should the solar system be destroyed by the after-effects of Bulerite and war.

After overcoming attempts to stop them, Asterome finally manages to leave the solar system, heading for Alpha Centauri, the nearest star.

(II) Macrolife: 3000 ... A thousand years later, Asterome has grown by adding concentric layers of shells around itself, and is now host to millions of humans and &quot;Humanity II&quot; cybernetic organisms.

The invention of engines that can surpass the speed of light has made it possible for the colony to explore far and wide; the second part finds them studying a planet orbiting the star Praesepe over 500 light years away. John Bulero, a young clone of one of the original Bulero&#x27;s, decides to see what life is like on a planet, and lives for a while amongst the natives, descendants of a human colony that has reverted to savagery. His experiences, while tragic, enable him to grow as an individual.

Eventually, Asterome travels back to the solar system to see how events there have unfolded. Their arrival coincides with the first time humans meet an intelligent alien species which is itself experimenting with Macrolife, and, together, the species begin a process of intermingling and further expansion into the universe.

(III) The Dream of Time ... A hundred billion years have passed, and Macrolife is now the dominant culture throughout the universe, which is, at this stage, beginning to contract into its final death throes. Most life is in the form of a &quot;Hyperpersonal Aggregate&quot;; an amalgam of individuals of all kinds. The aggregate re-individualizes John Bulero again, to help them solve the problem of how Macrolife can survive beyond the death of the Universe. Eventually, they discover many Macrolife survivors from many previous cycles of the universe, who help them to conquer time itself.

==Follow ups==
Several other books have been written to take place in the same fictional world:
*&quot;Transfigured Night&quot; and &quot;Wayside World&quot;, two novelettes published in 1978, are &quot;set in the planned Macrolife mosaic of short stories, novelettes, novellas, and novels&quot;. &quot;Wayside World&quot; (part of a shared-universe project generated by Poul Anderson) was also the name of a chapter in the novel.
*&quot;In the Distance, and Ahead in Time&quot; a Macrolife novelette, was published in Amazing Stories in 1993. It was also the title of his 10-story short-story collection of 2002 ().
*In 1999, Zebrowski wrote &quot;Cave of Stars&quot;, set in the same universe as &quot;Macrolife&quot; (though not a sequel).

<doc id="204235" wikidata="Q420576" url="?curid=204235" title="Fraticelli">
<text>The Fraticelli (Italian for “Little Brethren”) or Spiritual Franciscans opposed changes to the rule of Saint Francis of Assisi, especially with regard to poverty, and regarded the wealth of the Catholic Church as scandalous, with the riches of individual churchmen as invalidating their status. The Fraticelli were declared heretical in 1296 by Boniface VIII.

The name &quot;Fraticelli&quot; is used for various sects, which appeared in the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, principally in Italy, that split from the Franciscan Order on account of the disputes concerning poverty. It is necessary to differentiate the various groups of Fraticelli, although the term may be applied to all. The main groups were the &quot;Fraticelli de Paupere Vita&quot; and the &quot;Fraticelli de Opinione&quot; (also called Michaelites).

The Apostolics (also known as Pseudo-Apostles or Apostolic Brethren) are excluded from the category, because admission to the Order of Saint Francis was expressly denied to their founder, Gerard Segarelli. The Apostolics had no connection to the Franciscans, in fact desiring to exterminate them.

Umberto Eco&#x27;s novel &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; is set against the persecution of Fraticelli.

==Etymology==
&quot;Fraticelli&quot; is a diminutive of the Italian &quot;frate&quot; (plural &quot;frati&quot;), itself derived from Latin &quot;Frater&quot; “brother”, often shortened to &quot;Fra&quot; when referring to members of religious orders.

&quot;Frati&quot; was a designation of the members of the mendicant orders founded during the thirteenth century, principally the Franciscans. The Latin &quot;Fraterculus&quot; does not occur in the old records which concern the Fraticelli. Etymologically, the name Friars Minor (&quot;Fratres Minores&quot;) is equivalent to the diminutive &quot;Fraticellus&quot;. The ideal of the founder of the Friars Minor, Saint Francis of Assisi, was that his disciples, by evangelical poverty, complete self-denial, and humility, should lead the world back to Jesus Christ. The Italian people designated as Fraticelli all the members of religious orders (particularly mendicants), and especially hermits, whether these observed monastic precepts or regulated their own lives.

==Background==
Early Franciscans were itinerant preachers, who, following their founder Francis of Assisi, took to heart Christ&#x27;s injunction in Luke 9:3: “Take nothing for the journey – no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra shirt.” Living by such a rule required constant begging for alms, and over time this produced tensions, both with potential benefactors faced with repeated appeals from mendicant friars, and with established monastic orders accustomed to aid from the same pool of benefactors.

Over time, as the order grew, it faced the demands of caring for sick or elderly friars, and providing for its members sent to university for theological training. The order divided into two branches, the &quot;Zelanti&quot;, or Spirituals, and the &quot;Relaxati&quot;, known later as the Conventuals. The &quot;Zelanti&quot; strictly observed the poverty enjoined by the testament of Saint Francis, and lived isolated, simple lives. The &quot;Relaxati&quot; or Conventuals lived in convents in the towns, tending attached churches with the necessary liturgical furnishings and devoting themselves also to studying and preaching, which required the accumulation and use of books.

In support of the friars’ commitment to “holy poverty”, Pope Gregory IX adopted a legal construct whereby gifts to the Franciscans were vested in the Holy See, thus granting the friars mere loaned use of these. In this way, they need not be perennially destitute. Pope Innocent IV gave the Franciscans permission to appoint “procurators” to buy, sell, and administer goods given to them. Pope Nicholas III confirmed this arrangement in 1279, in the papal bull &quot;Exiit qui seminat&quot;. The &quot;Zelanti&quot; or &quot;Spirituals&quot; felt this abrogated the spirit of Saint Francis, and believed a restricted use of property was more in keeping with his rule. The differences were not fully adjusted nor was unity ever completely restored between the Spirituals and the main body of the order, the Community.

==Various &quot;Fraticelli&quot; groups==
===Angelo da Clareno and the &quot;Clareni&quot;===
The first Fraticelli group was begun by Brother Angelo da Clareno (also “da Cingoli”). Angelo and several brethren from the March of Ancona had been sentenced in c. 1278 to life imprisonment, but were liberated by the general of the order, Raimondo Gaufredi (1289–1295) and sent to Armenia, where the king Hethum II welcomed them. The local clergy, however, were less enthusiastic, and following popular agitations against them the group were expelled from Armenia towards the end of 1293. They returned to Italy, where in 1294 Celestine V, noted for his asceticism but whose pontificate lasted scarcely six months, permitted them to live as hermits in the strict observance of the Rule of Saint Francis. Celestine absolved them of their vows of obedience to their Franciscan superiors, and constituted them as a separate group of “Poor Hermits” who could live at the monasteries of the Celestines. He also named Cardinal Napoleone Orsini as cardinal-protector.

After the abdication of Celestine V, his successor, Boniface VIII, revoked all of Celestine’s concessions, and the Clareni emigrated to Greece, where some of them attacked the legality of the pope’s action. The Conventuals persuaded Boniface that the Clareni still held for Celestine and did not recognize Boniface as pope. He then persuaded the Patriarch of Constantinople, John XII, to take measures against them, and they moved to Thessaly. Seeking to defend themselves against this calumny, they returned to Italy where their leader, Fra Liberatus, attempted a vindication of their rights, first with Boniface VIII (d. 11 October 1303), and then with Benedict XI, who also died prematurely (7 July 1304). On his journey to Clement V (1305–1314) at Lyon in 1307, Liberatus died, and Angelo da Clareno succeeded him as leader of the community.

Angelo remained in Central Italy until 1311, when he went to Avignon, where he was protected by his patrons Cardinals Giacomo Colonna and Napoleone Orsini Frangipani. There, he successfully defended himself against a charge of heresy that had been brought against him. He was finally acquitted after a tedious and searching examination.

Early in 1317 John XXII, pursuant to a decree of the late Boniface VIII, declared Angelo excommunicated and placed him in custody. He ably defended himself in his &quot;Epistola Excusatoria&quot;, but John XXII refused to approve the &quot;Clareni&quot; as a religious congregation, and compelled Angelo to adopt the habit of a Celestine hermit. Angelo remained at the papal court in Avignon until the death of his friend Cardinal Colonna in 1318, and then returned to Italy. The procurator of the Celestines refused to allow him to stay at Celestine monasteries: he was instead welcomed by the Benedictine abbot Bartolomeo at the Sacro Speco di Subiaco. In 1334, John XXII ordered the guardian of the Convent of Aracoeli in Rome to take possession of the person of Angelo, but Abbot Bartolomeo refused to hand him over.

It appears from the papal bulls that the followers of Angelo established themselves in Central Italy, i.e., in the province of Rome, Umbria, and the March of Ancona, and also in Southern Italy (Campagna, Basilicata, and Naples). From Subiaco, Angelo sent circular letters to his friars who live in hermitages or were o we scattered in convents. He assumed charge of the congregation dissolved by the pope, appointing provincials, ministers and custodians, and establishing new friaries. John XXII and his immediate successors issued numerous decrees against the Fraticelli in the March of Ancona, where the bishops and minor feudal barons defended them stubbornly and successfully in spite of papal threats. As he grew increasingly infirm, Angelo less able to visit friars scattered around Rome, Ancona, Naples, and Umbria, and communicated with them by letter. The lack of his personal presence contributed to a decline in discipline.

His adherents considered their rule as representing the Gospel, and they reasoned as the Pope cannot dispense from the Gospel, so he also cannot dispense from the rule nor or even explain it in any way other than its literal sense. After the controversy regarding poverty broke out (1321–1328), all the Fraticelli showed stronger opposition to the papacy.

With the election of Benedict XII, the Fraticelli hoped for reconciliation with the Avignon papacy. At a consistory on 23 December 1334, Benedict XII scorned the Fraticelli, criticising their conduct, heretical tendencies, lax discipline, and outright contempt for the official Church.

Angelo was able to move from Subiaco, heading towards the Kingdom of Naples, where the presence of Philip of Majorca and Provençal and Catalan Spirituals at the court of Queen Sancha guaranteed continuous assistance. Angelo died 15 July 1337, and the leaderless congregation, loosely organized to begin with and hard-pressed by the Inquisition, splintered into a number of groups.

Angelo was highly esteemed by the Augustinian Hermits, with whom he was on friendly terms, especially with Gentile da Foligno and Simone da Cassia, an ascetic writer of great repute. He corresponded with both, and after the death of Angelo, Simone bitterly lamented the loss of a friend and spiritual adviser. It is likely that the Fraticelli whom Simone afterwards successfully defended against the Dominicans in the civil courts at Florence (c. 1355), where he was then preaching, were adherents of Clareno.

In April 1389, Fra Michele Berti, from Calci near Pisa, a member of the Ancona branch of Fraticelli, after preaching the Lenten course to his associates in Florence, was arrested as he was about to leave the city, and condemned by the Franciscan Archbishop of Florence, Bartolomeo Oleari, to be burnt at the stake. Berti was executed 30 April 1389, chanting the &quot;Te Deum&quot; as he died while his followers, unmolested by the authorities, exhorted him to remain steadfast. To the end, he maintained that John XXII had become a heretic by his four decretals, that he and his successors had forfeited the papacy, and that no priest supporting them could validly absolve sins.

The &quot;Poor Hermits&quot; of Monte della Majella, near Sulmona, were adherents of Angelo da Clareno, and at one time afforded protection to the famous tribune of the people, Cola di Rienzi (1349). Fanatical as they were on the subject of poverty, they were, in accordance with ancient custom, sheltered by Celestine monks in the nearby abbey of Santo Spirito. The origin of the Clareni, approved as true Franciscans by Sixtus IV in 1474, is unknown, nor is it clear whether they were “moderate” followers of Angelo who managed to remain within the bounds of orthodoxy, or schismatics who recanted after breaking communion with the papacy.

===Fraticelli de paupere vita===

Chronologically the second main group of Fraticelli were the Spirituals who fled from Tuscany to Sicily, and were surnamed at first the “Rebellious Brothers” and Apostates, but later the &quot;Fraticelli de paupere vita&quot;.

When, in 1309, the differences between the Relaxati and the Spirituals had reached a critical point, Clement V cited representatives of both parties to appear before the Curia with a view to adjusting their disputes. The result of this conference was the Constitution &quot;Exivi de Paradiso&quot;, enacted at the final session of the Council of Vienne (6 May 1312). This Constitution contained an explanation of the Rule of Saint Francis along stricter lines than those of the bull &quot;Exiit qui seminat&quot; of Nicholas III (14 August 1279), and justified the Spirituals in various matters. This proceeding, however, only provoked the &quot;Relaxati&quot; superiors to take energetic measures against the &quot;Zelanti&quot;.

Towards the end of 1312 a number of Tuscan Spirituals left their monasteries and took forcible possession of the monasteries of Carmignano (near Florence), Arezzo, and Asciano, putting the Relaxati to flight. About fifty, fearing punishment, fled to Sicily. Clement V, hearing of these events, commanded the Archbishop of Genoa and two other bishops to force them to return to obedience under penalty of excommunication. As nearly all disregarded this mandate, the prior of San Fidele at Siena, who had been commissioned to execute it, declared them excommunicated and placed their monasteries under interdict (14 May 1314). As it soon became impossible for them to remain in Tuscany, they all fled to Sicily, where they were joined by numerous Zelanti from Northern Italy and Southern France. King Frederick of Sicily, brother of King James II of Aragon, admitted them after they had submitted their statutes to his inspection. Fra Enrico da Ceva was now their leader.

John XXII (15 March 1317) admonished King Frederick to take severe measures against them. In a letter of the same date addressed by the cardinals at Avignon to the entire hierarchy of Sicily, special stress was laid on the fact that the fugitives had elected a superior general, provincials, and guardians. On 23 January 1318, Pope John XXII excommunicated them in the bull &quot;Gloriosam ecclesiam&quot;, specifying five errors, to wit: (1) they designated the Roman Church as carnal and corrupt, and themselves as spiritual; (2) they denied to the Roman priesthood all power and jurisdiction; (3) they forbade taking an oath; (4) they taught that priests in the state of sin could not confer the sacraments; and (5) they asserted that they alone were the true observers of the Gospel.

Banished from Sicily, where, however, some remained till at least 1328, they established themselves securely in Naples.

===Michaelites===
This third group of the Fraticelli derive their name from Michael of Cesena (died 1342), their chief representative and natural leader. It must be premised that this name was in vogue during the fifteenth century and that the party it designated exerted great influence in doctrinal matters on the other groups as early as 1329.

The controversy began at Narbonne in 1321 between the Dominicans and Franciscans. The main question at issue seems to have been whether it is heretical to assert that Christ and His Apostles possessed no property either in particular or in common. In 1321 the Dominican Inquisitor at Narbonne, John of Belna, declared heretical the teaching of an imprisoned Beghard of that region, who asserted that Christ and the Apostles owned nothing either individually or in common. The Franciscan lector, Bérenger Talon, defended the Beghard. Berenger refused to retract and was threatened with punishment by the inquisitor. The matter soon developed into a general controversy between the Dominicans and Franciscans. On this particular issue the &quot;Relaxati&quot; and &quot;Zelanti&quot; agreed citing the Bull of Nicholas III, &quot;Exiit qui seminat&quot;, which had defined the poverty of the Franciscans, both individually and collectively, as equivalent to that of the Apostles, and had therefore transferred to the Roman Church all their holdings in land and houses, as had already been enacted by Innocent IV (14 November 1245).

Because of the important bearing of the controversy on the rule of the Friars Minor, a general chapter of the order was convoked at Perugia, in June of the year 1322, and the minister general, together with the other members of the chapter, caused two letters or communications to be published in which the mind of the chapter regarding the controversy is set forth at considerable length. Anticipating, on the advice of the Franciscan Cardinals Vitalis and Bertrand, the definitive decision of the pope, the chapter solemnly declared in favor of the &quot;absolute poverty&quot; of Christ (4 June 1322). This pronunciamento was signed by the general, Michael of Cesena, the provincial ministers of Southern Germany, England (William of Nottingham, not Occam), Aquitania, Northern France, and others, as well as by several renowned scholars. On 11 June the chapter solemnly published its decrees to all Christendom.

Indignant at the action of the chapter at Perugia, Pope John XXII published the bull &quot;Ad conditorem canonum&quot; (8 December 1322), in which he renounces the dominion of all the goods of the Friars Minor hitherto assumed by the Roman pontiffs. He declared that the Roman Church renounced all its claims to the movable and immovable properties of the Franciscan Order and therewith returned them. John echoed Gerard of Abbeville, declaring that the ownership of a thing cannot be separated from its actual use or consumption. The Franciscans objected to this attack on their longstanding beliefs and customs and the poverty that was their hallmark.

In the name of the order Bonagrazia of Bergamo, a capable lawyer and up to that time a bitter enemy of the Zelanti, presented a daring protest against this Bull to the consistory of 14 January 1323. Although the pope thereupon revised the text of the Bull and reissued it under the original date, he incarcerated Bonagrazia and in the bull &quot;Cum inter nonnullos&quot; (12 November 1323) declared heretical the assertion that Christ and the Apostles possessed no property either separately or collectively.

The controversy between the pope and the order soon took on a political character, the Minorites having been appointed counselors to Louis IV the Bavarian, King of Germany, who also was engaged in a conflict with the pope. The Sachsenhausen Appeal of King Louis of 22 May 1324 was full of invectives against the “heretic who falsely designates himself Pope John XXII” for doing away with the poverty of Christ. This famous &quot;Spiritualist excursus&quot; is closely connected with the Appeal of Bonagrazia, and with writings of Ubertino of Casale and of Peter John Olivi. It is certain that it originated among the Franciscans who, under the protection of the king, aimed it at John XXII and his teaching, although Louis IV later denied all responsibility in the matter. The result was that Louis IV was excommunicated. The general chapter of the order, assembled at Lyon on 20 May 1325 under the presidency of Michael of Cesena, forbade any disrespectful reference to the pope.

On 8 June 1327, Michael received instructions to present himself at Avignon, a command which he obeyed in December 1327. The pope having sharply reproved him in public (9 April 1328) for the chapter&#x27;s action at Perugia, he drew up a secret protest and, fearing punishment, fled, despite the orders of the pope, to Aigues-Mortes and thence to Pisa, together with Bonagrazia of Bergamo and William of Occam.

In the meantime, Louis the Bavarian had entered Rome with a German army, and had himself solemnly crowned Emperor of Rome by Sciarra Colonna (17 January 1328); on 12 May he nominated and had consecrated as antipope Pietro Rainalducci of Corvara, a Franciscan, under the name of Nicholas V. The three fugitives from Avignon accompanied Louis to Bavaria, where they remained till their deaths. After Louis IV had returned to Bavaria, Nicholas V, deprived of all support, took refuge with the Count of Donoratico.

John XXII deposed Michael as general of the order and appointed the Minorite Cardinal Bertrand de Turre vicar-general of the order to preside at the chapter to be held in Paris (2 June 1329). Obedient to John XXII, he induced the majority of the order to submit to the Holy See. Michael of Cesena and all his adherents, the Michaelites, were repudiated by the order. At the same time, by command of John XXII, papal proceedings were instituted against them everywhere. The Michaelites denied John&#x27;s right to the papacy and denounced both him and his successors as heretics.

The proceedings against Michael were published in various localities. On 5 September 1328, John XXII commanded the imprisonment of Fra Azzolino, who was acting as Michael’s vicar, and on 18 August 1331, the arrest of another vicar, Fra Thedino, who represented Michael in the March of Ancona.

Prominent among the followers of Michael were the more or less numerous Minorites in the monasteries of Todi and Amelia (against whom proceedings were instituted in 1329–30), of Cortona (1329), and of Pisa (1330), where, however, they appeared openly as late as 1354, and at Albigano, and Savonna (1329–1332). Papal decrees reveal the presence of Michaelites in England (1329), Germany (1322), Carcassonne, Portugal (1330), Spain (1329), Sicily and Lombardy (1329, 1334), Sardinia, Armenia, and other places.

The records of a process (1334) conducted in irregular form against the Fraticelli of the Franciscan monastery at Tauris, who had been reported by Dominicans, show that they inveighed openly against John XXII and upheld the views of Michael of Cesena, although in their apocalyptic manner they declared that the order of the Friars Minor was divided in three parts, and that only those would be saved who would journey to the East, i.e. themselves. It is uncertain whether these were identical with the Fraticelli in Armenia, Persia, and other oriental localities, where all bishops were commanded by Clement VI to prosecute them (29 May 1344). For a long time, the sect prospered exceedingly in the Duchy of Spoleto on account of the continual political turmoil. In a process instituted against a particular Umbrian group of Fraticelli in 1360, it is noted that Fra Francesco Niccolò of Perugia was their founder. They pretended to observe the Rule of St. Augustine, but were fanatical on the question of poverty and regarded all prelates as guilty of simony.

They imitated the Sicilian Fraticelli in their doctrines and methods of instruction. A letter is still extant which the Fraticelli of the Campagna (1353–1355) wrote to the magistrates of Narni when they heard that one of their number (Fra Stefano) had been cruelly imprisoned by the Inquisition of that city twelve or fifteen years before. In this letter, they petitioned the magistrates to liberate him according to the example of the cities of “Todi, Perugia, Assisi, and Pisa”.

==Naples==
It subsequently becomes difficult to differentiate these groups with precision. In Naples and Calabria, where King Robert and Queen Sanzia exhibited special veneration for St. Francis and his humble followers, the chaplaincies were held by Franciscans. There resided Fra Philip of Majorca, a brother of the queen. Like his father, James II of Majorca, Philip was sympathetic towards the Spiritual Franciscans. He was also a great admirer of Angelo da Clareno. In 1328 Philip had petitioned John XXII for permission for himself and other Franciscans to observe literally the Rule of St. Francis, independently of the superiors of the order; the pope had refused. In a letter dated 10 August 1333, the pope was obliged to settle some doubts of the queen relating to the observance of &quot;holy poverty&quot;, and the king had even composed a treatise favouring the views of the Chapter of Perugia (1322). The papal condemnations of the Fraticelli, therefore, had produced but slight results in the Kingdom of Naples.

On 1 August 1322, John XXII issued a general decree against the &quot;Fraticelli de paupere vita&quot;, and after sending King Robert (4 February 1325) the Bulls specially directed against Fra Enrico da Ceva, on 10 May 1325, demanded their imprisonment at the hands of King Robert and of Charles, Duke of Calabria. The pope had to repeat this admonition several times (1327, 1330, 1331) to proceed against the Fraticelli. After this, some joined the Michaelites. The statement that some professed Mohammedanism may be based on fact, considering their situation and the local circumstances.

On 8 July 1331, the pope admonished King Robert to withhold no longer the papal decrees against Michael of Cesena nor prevent their publication in his kingdom. Philip of Majorca, however, preached openly against the pope. It was due to the influence of the royal family that Fra Andrea of Galiano, a court chaplain at Naples, was acquitted in the process instituted against him at Avignon in 1338, as he still continued his intercourse with Michael of Cesena and with the fifty Michaelites who resided for some time under the king&#x27;s protection in the castle of Lettere near Castellamare, but who later (1235) humbly submitted to their lawful superiors.

In 1336, &quot;short-robed&quot; Fraticelli still occupied the monastery of Santa Chiara at Naples, founded by Queen Sanzia, and were established in other parts of the kingdom; their expulsion was demanded on 24 June 1336 by Benedict XII (1334–1342). In 1344, Clement VI (1342–1352) found it necessary to reiterate the earlier decrees.

Several followers of Clareno were in the territory of Naples in 1362. Louis of Durazzo (a nephew of Robert, King of Naples) maintained a number of Fraticelli in a hospital adjoining his castle, Monte Sant&#x27; Angelo, and attended their services. These Fraticelli were divided into three sects: those acknowledging Tommaso da Bojano, former Bishop of Aquino; the followers of the pretended minister general, Bernard of Sicily; and those who claimed Angelo da Clareno as their founder and acknowledged only his successor as their general. All three sects agreed in holding that the true papacy had ceased since the alleged heresy of John XXII, but the party of the minister general held it lawful to accept, in case of necessity, the ministrations of priests who adhered to the papacy.

Between 1363–1370, it at last became possible for Franciscans to take possession of several monasteries in Calabria and Sicily from which the Fraticelli had been expelled; but Gregory XI complained on 12 September 1372 that the &quot;ashes and bones of Fraticelli were venerated as relics of saints in Sicily, and churches were even erected in their honour&quot;.

==Other areas==
The Fraticelli enjoyed complete liberty in Perugia. They lived where it best suited them, principally in the country-houses of the rich. They became so bold as to publicly insult the Minorites (Conventuals) in the monastery of San Francesco al Prato. It appears that these Fraticelli had elected their own popes, bishops and generals, and that they were split into various factions. The Conventuals, as their one means of defence, called in Fra Paoluccio of Trinci, the founder of the Observants, and ceded to him the small monastery on Monte Ripido near the city (1374). Fra Paoluccio was successful in his disputations with the Fraticelli, and when they had been clearly exposed as heretics, the people drove them from the city. These Fraticelli, and probably all the others of that period, were designated Fraticelli &quot;della opinione&quot;, perhaps on account of their opinion that the Roman papacy had ceased to exist with John XXII (1323) or Celestin V, and that they alone constituted the true Church. About this time, Fra Vitale di Francia and Fra Pietro da Firenze exercised a sort of generalship over the Fraticelli. They received protection and hospitality from rich and influential families in Apulia, around Rome, and in the March. One of their protectors was the knight Andreuccio de Palumbario, who sheltered them in his castle near Rieti, for which he was sharply called to account by Urban VI (4 May 1388). On the same day, the Benedictine Abbot of Farfa was reprimanded for a similar fault.

On 14 November 1394, Boniface IX empowered the Minorites of Terra di Lavoro to take possession of the monasteries deserted by the Fraticelli. Martin V conceded the same rights to the Franciscans of the Roman Province (14 November 1418) and, on 7 April 1426, transferred to them as a special grant the monastery of Palestrina, which had been a stronghold of the Fraticelli. In the same year, Martin V nominated St. John Capistran (27 May) and St. James of the Marches (11 October) as inquisitors general to take action against the Fraticelli. These promoters of order among the Franciscans fulfilled the duties of their office strictly and energetically and succeeded in striking at the very vitals of the sect. In 1415, the city of Florence had formally banished the &quot;Fraticelli of the poor life, the followers of Michelino of Cesena of infamous memory&quot;, and in Lucca five Fraticelli, on trial, had solemnly abjured their error (1411). Martin V also ordered the Bishops of Porto and Alba to take steps against all Fraticelli &quot;in the Roman province, the March of Ancona, the Duchy of Spoleto and other localities&quot; (7 June 1427).

On 27 January of the same year, Martin V permitted the Observants of Ancona to occupy the monastery of the Fraticelli at Castro l&#x27;Ermita as a first step in the campaign against the Fraticelli of that neighbourhood. On 1 June 1428, he commanded the Bishop of Ancona to enforce his rulings strictly in Maiolati, to put all suspects to the rack, destroy their village, separate the children from heretical parents, and disperse the elder population. A circular letter, which the Fraticelli addressed to all Christendom, proved ineffectual and their doom was sealed. John of Capistrano and James of the Marches burned thirty-six of their establishments or dispersed the members and also a number were burned at the stake at Florence and Fabriano, at the latter place in the presence of the pope.

==Later history==
A form of Fraticelli was also represented by Philip of Berbegni, a fanatical and eccentric Observant of Spain (1433), who attempted to establish a strict society de la Capuciola, but met vigorous opposition from John Capistran, who issued a dissertation against him.

James of March, commissioned by Nicholas V to proceed against them (1449), wrote the &quot;Dialogus contra Fraticellos&quot;, which he first published in 1452, making some additions to it later on. According to this the main establishments of the Fraticelli were situated in the valley of Jesi, at Maiolati, Poggio Cupo, Massaccia, and Mergo. They had also constituted bishops in other districts where there were a sufficient number of adherents. They made frequent journeys for propaganda purposes, especially in Tuscany. Some dressed partly as Minorites, some as hermits, often disguising themselves for the sake of protection. Their doctrine was a résumé of their former sectarian errors: the whole Roman Church had deserted the true Faith since the time of John XXII (1323); they alone constituted the true Church and retained the sacraments and the priesthood.

Only once again are measures known to have been taken against the Fraticelli, viz., in 1466, when a number of Fraticelli from Poli, near Palestrina, and Maiolati were captured at Assisi during the Portiuncula celebration. They were imprisoned in the castle of Sant&#x27; Angelo and proceedings instituted against them. Their protector at Poli, Count Stefano de&#x27; Conti, was imprisoned, but they also received the protection of the noble Colonna family of Palestrina. Tradition also mentions that the Fraticelli established many other colonies and that they had an important centre in Greece, whence they sent out emissaries and where they sought refuge from the aggressive measures of St. James of the March. They generally held their reunions at night in private houses and half of the inhabitants of Poli are said to have been among their adherents. The allegation that their religious services were defiled by immoral practices cannot be proved. According to their doctrine, as contained in the &quot;Dialogus&quot;, immoral priests incurred the loss of the powers of order and jurisdiction. They had also their own bishop, Nicholas by name.

During this period numerous pamphlets were published controverting the errors of the Fraticelli. While the campaign was going on at Rome, information was brought concerning another sect similar to the Fraticelli, which had been discovered in Germany; but though these visionaries, led by Brothers Johann and Livin of Wirsberg, found adherents among the Mendicants in Bohemia and Franconia, they cannot be considered as Fraticelli. In spite of all persecutions, remnants of the original Fraticelli still survived, but their strength was crippled.

<text>Angelo da Clareno (1247/1248 – 15 June 1337), also known as Angelo Clareno, was the founder and leader of one of the groups of Fraticelli in the early 14th century.

==Life==
Originally known as Pietro da Fossombrone, he was born about 1248, and entered the Franciscan order around 1270. Believing that the rule of St Francis was not being observed and interpreted according to the mind and spirit of the Seraphic Father, he retired to a hermitage with a few companions and formed a new branch of the order known as the &quot;Clareni&quot;. The influence of the prophetical writings of Joachim of Floris, a Calabrian abbot, on Angelo and his followers, and in fact on the &quot;Spirituals&quot; generally of the thirteenth century, cannot be overrated.

By the Bull of Pope Sixtus IV, titled &quot;Dominus Noster Jesus Christus&quot;, the &quot;Clareni&quot; were ordered to unite to the main body of the Franciscans and placed under the obedience of the Minister General. But the number of Angelo&#x27;s followers was small; and his so-called reform brought upon himself in particular, and the &quot;Clareni&quot; in general, the suspicious disfavour of the Friars Minor who were not prepared to accept the extreme interpretation of the rule of St Francis which Angelo had adopted. The Provincial Minister had Angelo and a few other &quot;zealot&quot; leaders arrested in Rome as heretics and schismatics. They were imprisoned for nine years when in 1289, a new Provincial, Raymond Gaufredi ordered them released.

Fearing that to leave them in the March of Ancona would likely expose them to continued persecution, Gaufredi sent them to Armenia Minor (Cilicia), where the king had made a request to the Pope for the services of some friars to instruct the people. Angelo was sent, along with Tommaso da Tolentino, Marco da Montelupone, and Pietro da Macerata. Despite their success, or perhaps because of it, the friars in the province of Syria became jealous and agitated against the &quot;zealots&quot; who were exiled from Armenia towards the end of 1293.

The Conventual guardian at Acre summoned Angelo and Peter of Macerata to Cyprus in order that Angelo might clear his name preaching before the king and court. However, the guardian of Nicosia detained them as excommunicates. With their work in Armenia hampered they decided to return to Italy. However, the vicar of the Provincial of the Marche region let them know they were not welcome, so Guafredi and others, among them, Conrad of Offida, advised them to appeal to the new pope, Celestine V.

Celestine absolved them of their vows of obedience to their Franciscan superiors, and constituted them as a separate group of Poor Hermits who could live at the monasteries of the Celestines. He appointed Peter of Macerata as superior under the name of Brother Liberato. Celestine also named Cardinal Napoleone Orsini protector. Celestine was 79 when he became pope, and having little experience, proved relatively ineffectual, and resigned within six months. His immediate successors were less favorably disposed towards the new order. Upon the death of Liberato in 1307, Angelo became superior.

In 1311, he came to Avignon to answer a charge of heresy that had been brought against him. He was finally acquitted after a tedious and searching examination. Angelo left Avignon, at the end of 1312, to go to Majorca, where he stayed almost two months, with the Prince Philip, son of James I of Majorca. He returned to Avignon in the spring of 1313, but faced with the hostility of the Franciscans of Tuscany, took refuge in Sicily, under the protection of Federico III of Aragon.

In 1317, Pope John XXII, in the bull &quot;Sancta Romana Ecclesia&quot; abolished all the dissident Franciscan groups. Angelo was then forced to join the congregation of Celestines, but the procurator of the Celestines refused to allow him to stay at the Celestine monasteries: he was instead welcomed by the Benedictine abbot Bartolomeo at the Sacro Speco di Subiaco. From there he sends circular letters to his friars who live in hermitages or scattered in convents. 

In 1334, John XXII ordered the guardian of the convent of Ara Coeli in Rome to take possession of the person of Angelo. But Abbot Bartholomew refused to hand him over. Angelo was able to move from Subiaco, heading towards the Kingdom of Naples, where the presence of Philip of Majorca and Provencal and Catalan Spirituals at the court of Queen Sancia guaranteed continuous assistance.

Angelo was highly esteemed by the Augustinian Hermits, with whom he was on friendly terms, especially with Gentile da Foligno, socius of the prior general of the order, and Simone da Cassia, an ascetic writer of great repute. He corresponded with both, and, after the death of Angelo, Simone bitterly lamented the loss of a friend and spiritual adviser. It is likely that the Fraticelli whom Simone afterwards successfully defended against the Dominicans in the civil courts at Florence (c. 1355), where he was then preaching, were adherents of Clareno. 

In 1337 he retired to the little hermitage of Santa Maria d&#x27;Aspro, near Marsicovetere in Basilicata, where he died.

==Works== 

Angelo Clareno is the author, at least in great part, of the &quot;Chronica septem tribulationum Ordinis Minorum&quot;, which records the persecutions suffered by the &quot;Spirituals&quot;, beginning with the innovations made during St. Francis&#x27; sojourn in the East, and continuing under Elias, Crescentius, and Bonaventure. This work is characterized by heroic endurance; but is tinged with bias and bitterness. Another work of Angelo&#x27;s that deserves mention is the &quot;Declaratio regulae Minorum&quot;.

Angelo Clareno ranks among the best medieval translators from Greek. His knowledge of Greek impressed his confrères so much that they believed it to have been miraculously infused. He translated from Greek into Latin the Rule of St. Basil, the Dialogue of St. Macharius and the &quot;Scala Paradisi&quot; of John Climacus. In his &quot;Expositio Regulae Fratrum Minorum&quot; (Quaracchi, 1912), he gives long extracts from Greek Fathers translated by him.

<text>Kwajalein Atoll (; Marshallese:  ) is part of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI). The southernmost and largest island in the atoll is named Kwajalein Island, which its majority English-speaking residents (about 1,000 mostly U.S. civilian personnel) often use the shortened name, Kwaj . The total land area of the atoll amounts to just over . It lies in the Ralik Chain, southwest of Honolulu, Hawaii.

The US Navy has hosted a naval base on Kwajalein Island since World War II. It was the final resting place of the German cruiser &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; after it survived the Operation Crossroads nuclear test in 1946. In the late 1950s, the US Army took over the base as part of their Nike Zeus anti-ballistic missile efforts, and since then the atoll has been widely used for missile tests of all sorts. Today it is part of the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site, with various radars, tracking cameras, missile launchers, and many support systems spread across many islands. One of the five ground stations used in controlling the operation of the Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation system is located on Kwajalein. The Marshall Islands are a dependent nation through the Free Compact of Association with the United States, after their independence established in the 1980s from a U.N. Protectorate. The defense of the Kwajalein, and the Marshall Islands is the responsibility of the United States. The important missile test range has been a mutually agreed task, and many Marshalese work at the military bases. 

The atoll is also used as a base for orbital rocket launches with the Pegasus-XL rocket, and previously had a base for SpaceX for their Falcon 1 rocket.

== Geography ==

Kwajalein is the 14th largest coral atoll as measured by area of enclosed water. Comprising 97 islands and islets, it has a land area of and surrounds one of the largest lagoons in the world, with an area of . The average height above sea level for all the islands is about .

The atoll was formed when volcanoes on the seabed from 165 to 76 mya built up enough lava that the land rose from beneath the sea. It cannot be determined how far above sea level the original land rose. Then coral started growing around the land/volcano, about 56 mya. Then the land subsided leaving the coral ring of the atoll. The water temperature averages degrees. Underwater visibility is typically on the ocean side of the atoll.

The atoll has an extended oval shape running roughly WNW - ESE on the western side and then bending to run almost due south on the eastern side. It is framed by its three largest islands, Ebadon, Roi-Namur and Kwajalein, which are located at the extreme western, northern, and southern points, respectively. Roi-Namur is about east of Ebadon and NWN of Kwajalein. The atoll is from Honolulu, from Australia, and from Japan. Kwajalein Island is about north of the equator.

Islands often have alternate names: The first is the Marshallese name, the second was assigned somewhat arbitrarily by the U.S. Navy prior to their attack on the atoll during World War II. The original name was considered too difficult for English speakers to properly differentiate among the islands. The latter has often been retained by English speakers. The exception to this is Kwajalein itself, which is close to the native name; the received spelling is from German, however.

=== Kwajalein Island ===

Kwajalein Island is the southernmost and largest of the islands in the atoll. The area is about . It is long and averages about wide. To enlarge the island, the Americans placed fill at both the northwestern part of the island above the pier (within the atoll, by 1953), the northern part extending towards Ebeye, and the southwestern parts of the island (by 1970). The northern extension was used for housing, the remainder for industrial purposes.

Kwajalein Island&#x27;s population is about 1,000, mostly made of Americans with a small number of Marshall Islanders and other nationalities, all of whom require express permission from the U.S. Army to live there. Some 13,500 Marshallese citizens live on the atoll, most of them on Ebeye Island.

==== Passes near Kwajalein Island ====
* SAR Pass (Search And Rescue Pass) is the closest to Kwajalein on the West Reef. This pass is man-made and was created in the mid-1950s. It is very narrow and shallow compared to the natural passes in the lagoon and is only used by small boats.
* South Pass is on the West Reef, north of SAR Pass. It is very wide.
* Gea Pass is a deep water pass between Gea and Ninni islands.
* Bigej Pass is the first pass on the East reef north of Kwajalein and Ebeye.

===Other large islands===
Other islands in the atoll:

Ebeye is about north of eastern end of Kwajalein Island. It is not part of the Reagan Test Site; it is a Marshallese island-city with shops, restaurants, and an active commercial port. It is the administrative center of the Republic of the Marshall Islands at Kwajalein Atoll and the Kwajalein Atoll Local Government (KALGOV). It has the largest population in the atoll, with approximately 13,000 residents living on of land. Inhabitants are mostly Marshall Islanders but include a small population of migrants and volunteers from other island groups and nations. Ebeye is one of the most densely populated places in the world. Many of its residents live in poverty. A coral reef (visible and able to be traveled at low tide) links them to Kwajalein and the rest of the outside world. A causeway at the northern end of the island provides a roadway that connects to several other islands, forming a chain of inhabited islands about long. Connected islands include Loi, Shell, and Gugeegue.

Ebadon (&quot;&quot;, ) is located at the westernmost tip of the atoll. It was the second-largest island in the atoll before the formation of Roi-Namur. Like Ebeye, it falls fully under the jurisdiction of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and is not part of the Reagan Test Site. The village of Ebadon was much more heavily populated before the war, and it was where some of the irooj (chiefs) of Kwajalein Atoll grew up. Like many other key islets in the atoll, it has significant cultural and spiritual significance in Marshallese cosmology.

Roi-Namur is the northernmost island in the atoll, located some distance north of Kwajalein. It has several radar installations and a small residential community of unaccompanied US personnel who deal with missions support and radar tracking. It also has a number of Japanese bunkers and buildings from World War II which are preserved in good condition. Roi-Namur used to be four islands: Roi, Namur, Enedrikdrik (Ane-dikdik), and Kottepina. Roi and Namur were joined by a causeway built by forced laborers working under the Japanese military; it was filled with sand that was dredged from the lagoon by both the Japanese and later American administration between 1940 and 1945. After the war, the resulting conjoined islands were renamed Roi-Namur. There is a significant indigenous Marshall Islander workforce that commutes to Roi-Namur from the nearby island of Ennubirr, much like workers commute from Ebeye to Kwajalein. These workers are badged and have limited access to the island, although access is granted for islanders who need to use the air terminal to fly to Kwajalein.

=== Smaller islands ===
==== Eastern side====

Little Bustard (&#x27;, ) and Big Bustard (&#x27;, , &#x27;little Ebeye&#x27;) are the first and second islets respectively north of Kwajalein island on the East reef, and are the only islets between Kwajalein and Ebeye. During low tide and with protective boots, it is possible to wade across the reef between Kwajalein and Little Bustard.

Gugeegue or Gugegwe ( ; Marshallese: &quot;&quot;, ) is an islet north of Ebeye and is the northernmost point of the concrete causeway connecting the islets between them. Gugeegue is just south of the Bigej Pass which separates it from Bigej islet.

Bigej, just north of the Ebeye chain, is covered with tropical palm trees and jungle. People from Kwajalein have visited it for picnics and camping. It is a site of cultural significance to the indigenous people of Kwajalein atoll, as are most of the small islands throughout the atoll. Some Kwajalein atoll landowners have proposed developing Bigej to look similar to the landscaped beauty of Kwajalein islet, for the exclusive use of Kwajalein atoll landowners and their families.

Meck is about north of Kwajalein. It is a launch site for anti-ballistic missiles and is probably the most restricted island of all the U.S.-leased sites. It was originally built up as part of the Nike-X program, as the main island of Kwajalein was already filled with equipment from the earlier Nike Zeus program, some of which remained in use during Nike-X testing. A large berm was built on the northern end of the island to support the missile silos, while a Missile Site Radar was built to its south, on the western side. An airstrip, somewhat longer than running north–south at the southeastern end of the island provided STOL service to the base, although the strong prevailing winds from the west made for very tricky landings. Air service was later deemed too dangerous, and replaced by helicopter pads at either end of the runway. After the Army&#x27;s main ABM programs shut down in the 1970s, Meck has served as the primary launch site for a variety of follow-on programs, including the Homing Overlay Experiment and THAAD, among many others.

Omelek, about north of Meck, is uninhabited and leased by the U.S. military. From 2006 to 2009, it was used by SpaceX to launch five Falcon 1 rockets.

===Western side===
 Enubuj (&quot;&quot;, ), or &quot;Carlson&quot; Islet which was its 1944 World War II U.S. operation codename, is situated next to Kwajalein to the northwest, directly west of Little Bustard. It was from this island that U.S. forces launched their amphibious invasion of Kwajalein island. Today, it is the site of a small Marshallese village with a church and small cemetery. The sunken vessel Prinz Eugen, used during the Bikini Atoll atomic weapons tests, is along the islet&#x27;s northern lagoon side.

Ennylabegan (&quot;&quot;, ), or &quot;Carlos&quot; Islet, is the site of a small Marshall Islander community that has decreased in size in recent decades; it was once a bigger village. Until 2012, it was actively used by the Reagan Test Site for telemetry tracking activities during missions and has been one of the only non-restricted Marshallese-populated islands used by the United States Army. As such, power and clean drinking water were provided to half of the island similar to the other military-leased islands. This has been phased out as the island ceases to be used for mission support. The power plant, which also performed water treatment, is no longer in use.

Legan (&quot;&quot;, ) is uninhabited but it has a few buildings on the southern part. Most of the island is thick and jungle-covered, like most in the Marshall Islands. Unlike most islands, Legan has a very small lake in the middle.

Illeginni was used as a remote launch site for Sprint and Spartan missiles during the 1970s, with Meck as the primary control center. Coral soil dredged from the northeastern tip of the island was piled up to build a berm supporting the missile launchers. Several remotely-controlled tracking cameras and other devices were also built on the island, and serviced by boats or helicopters landing on a pad on the western end of the island. Today a single tracking camera remains in use, along with telemetry equipment to support it. Illeginni was used successfully for the first Minuteman III land impact test in 1980. It also hosts one of the two remote receivers for the TRADEX radar, the other being on Gellinam and the main radar on Roi-Namur.

Nell has a unique convergence of protected channels and small islands. The Nell area is unique and a popular destination for locals and Americans sailing through the area with proper permissions from the Republic of the Marshall Islands. (All non-leased islands are strictly off-limits to American base residents and personnel without applying for official permission.)

 (&#x27;, ) is &#x27; or taboo, birthplace of the irooj (chiefly families) and off-limits to anyone without the blessing of the Iroijlaplap (paramount chief). The remains of a small Marshallese village and burial sites are still intact. This island is in the Mid-Atoll Corridor, and no one can reside there or on surrounding islands due to missile tests.

=== Wrecks in the lagoon ===
Because of the Battle of Kwajalein of World War II, the lagoon contains the wrecks of many ships and aircraft. Most of the ships were merchant vessels.

* Concrete barge &quot;Chromite&quot; (BCL-2570) – deliberately sunk as a breakwater near Ennylabegan (Carlos)
* &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; – sunk by accident near Enubuj (Carlson) after a post-war atomic bomb test
* &quot;Akibasan Maru&quot; – Japanese 4,607-ton freighter below &quot;P-buoy&quot; with the actual buoy marker no longer there. Sunk 30 January 1944.
* &quot;Ikuta Maru&quot; – 2,968-ton Japanese freighter at &quot;P-North&quot; just north of the now missing P-buoy. This is listed as being one of the transports for Allied prisoners of war during World War II.
* Unidentified wreck at G-buoy, in length
* &quot;Tateyama Maru&quot;, K-5 side
* &quot;Asakaze Maru&quot;, K-5 upright
* &quot;Tyoko Maru&quot; (or &quot;Choko Maru&quot;), a 3,535-ton freighter, at Barracuda Junction. Sunk 5 December 1943.
* Barge, between South Carlson and Sar Pass
* Wooden auxiliary sub chaser wreck near South Pass. The wooden hull has almost completely deteriorated.
* &quot;Shonan Maru #6&quot;, grounded at Gebh Island to avoid sinking but blown up
* Shell (or Ebwaj) Island wreck. trawler or whaler.
* South Shell wreck, similar to the Shell Island wreck
* &quot;Daisan Maru&quot;, a former whaler, near Bigej Pass
* &quot;Palawan&quot;, an engine freighter captured by the Japanese during the Battle of the Philippines. Sunk by the US destroyer 31 January 1944 near Bigej.
* &quot;Shoei Maru&quot;, a sunken freighter resting upside down at the O-buoy
* A Japanese aircraft just west of Ebeye
* A Martin PBM Mariner about 1 nautical mile west of Ebeye
* Four North American B-25 Mitchells, a Grumman TBF Avenger, a Vought F4U Corsair, four Douglas SBD Dauntlesses, and a Curtiss C-46 Commando in the western reef inside Roi-Namur

Barracuda Junction is about northeast of the southern tip of Enubuj (Carlson) Island.

===Climate===
The atoll has a tropical rainforest climate under the Köppen climate classification. The average temperature varies less than from month to month. The record low from 1950 to 1969 was . The highest temperature was .
While tropical rainforest climates have no true dry season, the atoll&#x27;s noticeably drier season occurs from January through March. The average annual rainfall was . The average monthly relative humidity is between 78 and 83%.

== History ==
Kwajalein () Atoll is an important cultural site to the Marshallese people of the Ralik chain. In Marshallese cosmology, Kwajalein island is the site of an abundant flowering zebra wood tree, thought to have spiritual powers. Marshallese from other islands came to gather the &quot;fruits&quot; of this tree.

This, explain many elders, is a Marshallese metaphor that describes the past century of colonialism and serves to explain why Kwajalein is still so precious to foreign interests. This story was the origin of the name &#x27;, which apparently derives from &#x27;, &quot;the people who harvest the flowers&quot;.

===First sighting by Europeans===
The first recorded sighting of Kwajalein by Europeans was during the Spanish expedition of Ruy López de Villalobos in January 1543. The atoll was charted as &quot;Los Jardines&quot; (The Gardens) because of its fresh appearance and trees. &quot;Los Jardines&quot; remained well located in most 16th and 17th century charts in the 8–10°N, as reported by the Villalobos expedition chroniclers. However, at some point in the late 18th century, due to some transcription error from the old Spanish maps, they start to appear in the nautical charts shifted northwards to 21°N, thus creating phantom islands of Los Jardines that, even if sought and never found, remained on charts of the Pacific until 1973.

The atoll came under the control of Spain but was largely ignored by European powers during the 17th and 18th centuries except for some short-lived missionary expeditions, minor trading posts and demarcation treaties between the Iberian kingdoms (Portugal and Spain).

In 1828–1829, Russian Navy captain Ludwig von Hagemeister made his final circumnavigation on the ship Krotky. During this journey, he surveyed the Menshikov Atoll (Kwajalein) in the Marshall Islands, plotting it on the map and specifying the location of some other islands. At the time, the atoll was known as &quot;Kuadelen&quot; and &quot;Kabajaia&quot; to Spain.

In early November, 1875, a typhoon resulted in an storm surge, drowning everyone on Kwajalein Island.

The German Empire annexed the Marshall Islands, including Kwajalein Atoll, as a protectorate on October 15, 1885.

===Japan in the &quot;Nan&#x27;yō&quot;: 1875–1945===
Japan had developed an interest in what it called the in the 19th century, prior to its imperial expansion into Korea and China. By 1875, ships from the newly established Imperial Japanese Navy began to hold training missions in the area. Shigetaka Shiga, a writer who accompanied a Navy cruise to the region in 1886, published his in 1887, marking the first time a Japanese civilian published a firsthand account of Micronesia. Three years later, Shiga advocated for annexation of the area by claiming that doing so would &quot;excite an expeditionary spirit in the demoralized Japanese race.&quot;

Despite the appeal imperialism had for the Japanese public at the time, neither the Meiji government nor the Navy seized any pretexts to fulfill this popular aspiration. It was through the commercial operations of fisherman and traders that the Japanese first began to make a wider presence in the region, which continued to grow despite challenges from competing German commercial interests.

At the outbreak of World War I in Europe, Japan joined the Triple Entente and seized the Marshall Islands against only token resistance. In 1922 the islands were placed under Japanese administration as a League of Nations Mandate, whereupon it was referred to as &quot;Kwezerin-kanshō&quot; () in Japan, part of the Nan&#x27;yō gunto. The islands of the Kwajalein Atoll, especially the main island, served as a rural copra-trading outpost administered by Japanese civilians until the beginning of World War II in the Pacific in December 1941.

Before the Pacific War, Japanese settlement in Kwajalein Atoll consisted mostly of traders and their families who worked at local branches of shops headquartered at nearby Jaluit Atoll. There were also local administrative staff at Kwajalein. With the establishment of Kwajalein&#x27;s public school in 1935, schoolteachers were sent to the island from Japan. Most Marshall Islanders who recall those times describe a peaceful time of cooperation and development between Japanese and Marshallese, although the latter were not considered on the same social tier as Japanese.

By the 1930s, immigration from the Japanese mainland had increased exponentially. In some regions of the Nan&#x27;yō, colonial settlers outnumbered Micronesian natives by as much as ten to one, amounting to the most significant violation of Japan&#x27;s League of Nations mandate. In the furthest eastern areas, however, immigrants remained in the minority. Contemporary testimony and postwar investigations have attested that Japan honored their agreement under the mandate to administer the islands peacefully. Nevertheless, Kwajalein along with the rest of the territories in the Nan&#x27;yō began to be fortified militarily after Japan&#x27;s departure from the League of Nations in 1933. With the assistance of the Imperial Japanese Navy, local infrastructure was improved between 1934 and 1939. The first combat units, from the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s 4th Fleet, arrived in February 1941. Prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, militarization of the Nan&#x27;yō, including Kwajalein, had been considered meagre enough that it alarmed Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue, who in January 1941 strongly urged the Ministry of the Navy to immediately expedite the process. A few months later, a naval officer stationed in Kwajalein sent a memorandum to the Naval Ministry denouncing the failure to ready the region for war. Both warnings were ignored by the Naval Ministry.

Korean forced laborers were ordered to work throughout the Pacific beginning in the early 1940s. Over 10,000 were sent to the Nan&#x27;yō area alone, mostly from the southernmost provinces of Chōsen. In some atolls, such as Wotje, those forced laborers were joined by Japanese prisoners from Hokkaido, most of them political dissidents. In order to build the aerial runway on Kwajalein Island, the Japanese public school was demolished and, along with the civil administration, moved to Namu Atoll. Islanders were forcibly moved to live on some of the smaller islets in the atoll. The trauma of this experience, together with the influx of these young and underprepared soldiers, surprised the local population. Islanders who survived this period make clear distinctions in their recollections of civilian and military Japanese for this reason. This is the first known instance of forced relocation in Kwajalein Atoll, although similar events took place throughout the Marshall Islands.
Archaeological evidence as well as testimony from Japanese and Marshallese sources indicate that this militarization would likely not have begun until the 1940s; it was left incomplete at the time of the American invasion in 1944.

On February 1, 1942, the aircraft carrier launched a series of raids on the Roi Namur airfield and merchant shipping in Carlos Pass, where they sank several ships. In Kwajalein, forced laborers from across the empire and Marshallese volunteers known as built military facilities throughout the atoll. These construction teams would repair the resulting damage from American bombing raids. A second wave of Japanese naval and ground forces was dispatched to Kwajalein in early 1943 from the Manchurian front. These soldiers were between the ages of 18 and 21, poorly trained, and had no experience in the tropics. The supply ships that were meant to provide them with food rations were sunk by American forces before reaching the atoll; many Japanese succumbed to illnesses like dengue fever and dysentery, as did many of the laborers. As the military situation worsened and the pressures of military ideology increased, soldiers at Kwajalein became harsher and more violent toward Marshall Islanders, whom they often suspected of spying for the Americans. Kwajalein was also the site of a prisoner of war camp, whose detainees were not registered with the Red Cross. The island acquired the nickname &quot;Execution Island&quot; because of the treatment and killing of prisoners at the hands of Japanese military staff. The Japanese military also tested biological warfare agents on prisoners there.

After the war, a US Naval War Crimes court located on the atoll tried several Japanese naval officers for war crimes committed elsewhere; at least one officer was condemned to death.

===American occupation===


On January 31, 1944, the 7th Infantry Division, spearheaded by the 111th Infantry Regiment performed an amphibious assault on Kwajalein. On February 1, 1944, Kwajalein was the target of the most concentrated bombardment of the Pacific War. An estimated 36,000 shells from naval ships and ground artillery on a nearby islet struck Kwajalein. B-24 Liberator bombers aerially bombarded the island, adding to the destruction.

Of the 8,782 Japanese personnel deployed to the atoll, including forced laborers, 7,870 were killed. U.S. military documents do not differentiate between the Japanese and Korean dead. However, the Korean government&#x27;s Truth Commission for Forced Labor Under Japanese Imperialism reports an official figure from the Japanese government of 310 Koreans killed in the American invasion of Kwajalein. Whether this figure represents Kwajalein islet or the whole atoll is unclear. Since no distinction was made between dead Japanese soldiers and Korean forced laborers in mass graves on Kwajalein, both are enshrined as war hero guardian spirits for the Japanese nation in Yasukuni Shrine. This enshrinement is solely due to the mingling of Korean and Japanese corpses in this one case and has not occurred with the remains of other Korean forced laborers elsewhere.

Additionally, while many of the native Marshallese successfully fled the island in their canoes just before the battle, an estimated 200 were killed on the atoll during the fighting. Kwajalein was one of the few locations in the Pacific War where indigenous islanders were recorded to have been killed while fighting for the Japanese. Many Marshallese dead were found among those killed in bunkers. The flat island offered no other protection against the heavy bombardment. Taking refuge in bunkers resulted in many Marshallese deaths when their shelters were destroyed by hand grenades. Some Marshallese were reportedly induced to fight by Japanese propaganda which, as would occur later in the Battle of Okinawa, stated that the Americans would indiscriminately rape and massacre the civilian population if they successfully took the atoll.

On February 6, 1944, Kwajalein was claimed by the United States and was designated, with the rest of the Marshall Islands, as a United Nations Trust Territory under the United States.

=== Evolution into a U.S. military installation ===

In the years following, Kwajalein Atoll was converted into a staging area for campaigns in the advance on the Japanese homeland in the Pacific War. After the war ended, the United States used it as a main command center and preparation base in 1946 for Operation Crossroads, the first of several series of nuclear tests (comprising a total of 67 blasts) at the Marshall island atolls of Bikini and Enewetak. Significant portions of the native population were forced to relocate as a result of American weapons testing and military activity in the islands between 1945 and 1965. The German heavy cruiser was towed to Kwajalein from Bikini Atoll after the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests. It developed a leak, was towed out, and sank in the lagoon.

The battleship was sunk in the ocean off Kwajalein Atoll after being exposed during atomic bomb testing on 10 February 1948.

By the 1950s, the Marshallese population working at the base at Kwajalein had grown. The conditions in the makeshift labor camp on Kwajalein islet were such that the U.S. Navy administering the atoll decided to relocate these Islanders to nearby Ebeye, an islet only three islands to the north of Kwajalein and accessible by a short boat ride or walk over the reef at low tide. Nuclear refugees from the atolls irradiated by the American tests were also moved to Ebeye.

With the end of the Cold War and a decreased threat of nuclear attack, many defense programs were canceled in the early 1990s. Continuing military operations and launch or re-entry tests perpetuate the dislocation of Marshall Islanders from their small islands throughout Kwajalein Atoll. The United States Army Kwajalein Atoll test site does not provide logistical support to Ebeye or Ennibur islets.

=== 21st century ===

In 2008, a new coalition government was formed in part from the Aelon Kein Ad Party (formerly known as the Kabua Party), which represents Kwajalein landowners and is led by Paramount Chief Imata Kabua. This government is negotiating a new Kwajalein Atoll Land Use Agreement with the United States.

With the election of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States, the new administration of the Marshall Islands, and the looming deadline for signing the Land Use Agreement (LUA), at the end of 2008, President Litokwa Tomeing wrote a letter to George W. Bush asking that the deadline for the LUA be lifted. Within a day of the expiration of this LUA deadline, the United States agreed to shift this deadline back another five years. But it reiterated its stance that the Compact renegotiation was already completed and that it expected the Republic of the Marshall Islands to abide by the Military Use and Operating Rights Agreement (MUORA) it agreed to in 2003. Government leaders and landowners were hopeful that this extension will allow for more money to be paid to the land owners.

The U.S. Army Garrison Kwajalein Atoll (USAG-KA) installation has been downsizing, in part because of budget constraints and technological improvements (such as a new trans-oceanic fiber-optic cable) that will allow the testing range to be operated extensively from sites in the United States, thus minimizing operation costs and the need for on-site workers or residents. Recently, the American population of the Kwajalein installation has dropped dramatically. The aluminum-sided trailers that housed the bulk of the contractor population are systematically being removed from the main island. Nevertheless, the enormous investment in these new technologies and recent statements by Army leadership indicate that the United States is committed to remaining in the Marshall Islands at Kwajalein Atoll for the foreseeable future.

In 2009, American ambassador Clyde Bishop commented that future funding to the Republic of the Marshall Islands was dependent on the use of Kwajalein.

Kwajalein Atoll has been leased by the United States for missile testing and other operations from well before independence for the Marshall Islands. Although this military history has influenced the lives of the Marshall Islanders who have lived in the atoll through the war to the present, the military history of Kwajalein has prevented tourism.

SpaceX updated facilities on Omelek Island to launch its commercial Falcon 1 rockets. The first successful Falcon 1 orbital space launch from Omelek was conducted in 2008. It could launch Falcon 9 rockets into polar and geosynchronous orbit. Due to a disagreement about building a new launch pad on Omelek, between either the US military or the RMI, SpaceX moved their main facilities to the US and no longer uses the facilities in the atoll.

Since 2000, Kwajalein has become one of five preferred locations from which Pegasus rockets can be launched into equatorial orbit.

==Demographics==
9,789 people lived on the atoll at the 2021 census, mostly on densely populated Ebeye Island, which is the second most populated island in the Marshall Islands. Many other islands have small populations around the atoll including near Roi-Namur and the western islands. Ebeye is linked by causeway to four other islands, and the southern area with the military base to the south is one of the larger population centers in the Western Side of the Marshall Islands.

== Current use by U.S. military ==
Kwajalein and Roi-Namur are the main islands used by the U.S. personnel. Provision is made for family housing. Personnel whose family members are not with them live in hotel room style housing.

=== Testing sites ===
Of the 97 islands, 11 are leased by the United States. They are part of the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (RTS), formerly known as Kwajalein Missile Range. The lease is active from 2006 to 2066, with an option to renew for another 20 years. Leased islands include Kwajalein, Meck, Eniwetak, Omelek, Gellinam, Gagan, Ennugarret, and Roi-Namur on the eastern side of the atoll and Ennylabegan, Legan, and Illeginni on the western side.

RTS includes radar installations, optics, telemetry, and communications equipment, which are used for ballistic missile and missile-interceptor testing, and for space operations support. Kwajalein island hosts the $914 million Space Fence radar, which tracks satellites and orbital debris. Kwajalein has one of five ground stations used in controlling the RTS range, which also assist in the operation of the Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation system.

== Wartime memorials ==
Very few Japanese or Korean remains were ever repatriated from the atoll; thus both Kwajalein and Roi-Namur have ceremonial cenotaphs to honor this memory. The memorial on Kwajalein was constructed by the Japan Marshall Islands War-Bereaved Families Association in the 1960s, and the memorial on Roi-Namur was constructed by American personnel. The memorial sites are dedicated to Japanese souls and to the sacrifices of Koreans, Marshallese, and Americans. U.S. Marine Corps intelligence records and photographs at the U.S. National Archives, together with the testimony of U.S. veterans, indicate that there was a mass-burial site consolidated into one place on Kwajalein islet, at or near the current cemetery. However, remains are scattered throughout the islet, at Roi-Namur, and in places throughout the atoll. Bereaved Japanese and Korean families have mixed sentiments about whether or not to return these remains to their home countries, as none of them are identifiable, and &quot;bone-collecting&quot; missions are sometimes perceived by families as an insult to the dead or a political stunt by the Japanese government.

Japanese bereaved family members consider the sites of sunken Japanese shipwrecks in Kwajalein lagoon to be sacred gravesites. They object to the activities of American divers who attempt to explore these wrecks.

A ceremony is held at Japan&#x27;s Yasukuni Shrine annually in April (originally held in February to coincide with the anniversary of the battle), where the memories of the Japanese soldiers are honored and surviving families offer prayers to their spirits. Small groups of bereaved Japanese families have made pilgrimages to Kwajalein on a semi-annual basis since the 1990s. The first of these groups was the Japan Marshall Islands War-Bereaved Families Association, which negotiated its visit with the U.S. Army as far back as 1964 and made its first visit in 1975 at the invitation of the Kwajalein Missile Range. The bereaved families of conscripted Korean laborers have also recently traveled in groups to the Marshall Islands and other parts of Micronesia, the Philippines, and Indonesia, with funding from the Japanese government, although they have not yet paid a group visit to Kwajalein.

The United States designated most of the island of Kwajalein and all of Roi-Namur as National Historic Landmarks in 1985, in recognition of the role those places played during World War II. The Kwajalein designation includes only the historical 1944 shape of the island, which has been enlarged since then by dredging and fill.

== Kwajalein Island ==

===History===
There was a private flying club from 1963 through the mid-1980s. They owned two aircraft, tied down outdoors off the Bucholtz airstrip. Because they used avgas, they were forced to dissolve when the Army switched over to turbine-powered aircraft and no longer stocked avgas.

=== Recreation ===

Kwajalein Island has several recreational accommodations, including two saltwater pools, multiple tennis courts, racquetball courts and basketball courts as well as playing fields for baseball, soccer, and other sports. The Corlett Recreational Center (CRC) is on the northeast side of the island and features several rooms for use by inhabitants as well as a full-size, indoor court where community and youth basketball, volleyball and indoor soccer can be played. The island features a nine-hole golf course near the airport, a bowling alley, libraries, a fitness center and two movie theaters. Inhabitants can rent boats for water skiing and fishing at the Kwajalein marina. Residents spear fish, deep-sea fish and scuba dive. The island also has a food court with a Subway, Burger King, and American Eatery, as well as a bar for evening drinking and relaxation.

=== Economy ===
On Kwajalein Island, housing is free for most personnel, depending on contract or tour of duty.

== Land leases ==
Under the constitution of the Republic of the Marshall Islands the government can own land only in limited circumstances. Practically, all land is private and inherited through one&#x27;s matriline and clan. Since the United States began leasing land, the issue of proper land payments has been a major issue of contention for landowners which continues today. &quot;Landowners&quot; here refers to the consortium of irooj (chiefs), alaps (clan heads) and rijerbal (workers) who have land rights to the places used for military purposes by the United States. In the case of Kwajalein Atoll in particular, a &quot;senior rijerbal&quot; is assigned a role to represent families who have claims to land as &quot;workers&quot; of that location.

Unclear and insufficient in the opinion of these landowners, the original lease arrangements for Kwajalein Atoll with the U.S. were finally negotiated only after the landowners and their supporters demonstrated in the early 1980s with a peaceful protest called &quot;Operation Homecoming,&quot; in which Islanders re-inhabited their land at Kwajalein, Roi-Namur, and other restricted sites. Although Operation Homecoming did not achieve the level of recognition for all people with land title at Kwajalein, the resulting agreements at least set a precedent for future dealings with the United States government.

One of these early agreements was the first official Military Use and Operating Rights Agreement (MUORA) between the United States Army and Government of the RMI, which was linked to the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) that was written into the larger Compact of Free Association with the United States. Article 3 of the MUORA obligated the RMI to lease specific sites from their owners through a Land Use Agreement (LUA) and then sub-lease them to the United States. Effectively, this rendered the land negotiations for use of Kwajalein Atoll a &quot;domestic issue&quot; between the national Marshallese government in Majuro and local &quot;landowners,&quot; even though Kwajalein, where the local Marshallese population deals on a daily basis with American military activity, is a considerable distance from Majuro. Many Kwajalein Atoll residents have complained in the past that Majuro is out of touch with the realities of Kwajalein Marshallese, and downplays their suffering while profiting from the income provided by the testing site.

The first MUORA guaranteed total payments of roughly US$11 million to the landowners through the year 2016, the majority of which went, via the provisions of the LUA to the irooj (chiefs), who had the largest stake in the land. Some American and Marshallese observers claimed that these land payments were &quot;misused.&quot; However, the recipients of these funds strongly maintain that these have always been &quot;rental&quot; payments (like a tenant pays to a landlord) that landowners could use at their own discretion, separate from whatever funds the U.S. earmarked to help develop or improve Kwajalein Atoll, which were funneled into the Kwajalein Atoll Development Authority (KADA).

In advance of its expiration in 2016, this LUA was renegotiated in 2003 as part of the Compact of Free Association, with the U.S. agreeing to pay the landowners (by the Republic of the Marshall Islands) $15 million a year, adjusted for inflation. In exchange for these payments, the Compact stipulated a new MUORA that gave the U.S. the option to use Kwajalein through 2066, renewable through 2086. The landowners, affiliated under the Kwajalein Negotiations Committee (KNC), were very unhappy with the proposed LUA, since they believed they should have been receiving at least double that amount in funds and that, more importantly, the LUA did nothing to provide for Marshall Islanders&#x27; welfare, health care, safety, and rapidly increasing population on Ebeye. By their independent land appraisals and calculations, the KNC had determined that the minimum acceptable compensation they should receive for Kwajalein lands was at least $19.1 million annually, adjusted for inflation. The landowners also claimed that there were many other terms by which they wished the U.S. would abide should the lease be extended, including providing better support and infrastructure to Ebeye, improving health care and education, guaranteeing that the missile testing was not creating environmental hazards, and providing a comprehensive life and property insurance policy. Despite a consensus among the landowners to refuse to allow the Compact to be signed with this inadequate LUA proposed by the U.S., the new Compact (and the MUORA, by extension) was finalized by officials of the RMI national government and went into effect in 2003.

Stating that they had not been consulted about this agreement, the landowners went on to protest it, and mounted an organized boycott of the new LUA. Although the new Compact and its component MUORA was ratified in 2003, they have since held out and refused to sign the LUA of 2003, insisting, through Kwajalein Atoll elected representatives, that either a new LUA should be drafted that considers their needs or the U.S. will have to leave Kwajalein when the active LUA (which began in the 1980s) expires in 2016.

The U.S., however, considers the Compact to be an &quot;internationally binding&quot; agreement that has been concluded. It thus pays an annual $15 million to the landowners, as agreed provisionally in the MUORA laid out in the 2003 Compact renegotiation; however, as this new LUA has not been signed, the difference of roughly $4 million has been going into an escrow account. The Compact stated that if the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the landowners did not reach an agreement about land payments by the end of 2008, these funds in escrow would be returned to the U.S. Treasury. Referring to this incentive to reach an agreement, then-Senator Tony deBrum stated that it would be &quot;insane&quot; for the Marshallese people to put up with another 70 years of lack of access.

In 2011, during the term in office of Jurelang Zedkaia, a statement was issue by the Office of the President in Majuro that a long-term LUA had been signed. Under the terms of the agreement, the United States was granted access until 2066, with an option to extend to 2086. A sum of over $32M held in the escrow account was then made available to the Kwajalein landholders. The landholders&#x27; spokesman, Christopher Loeak, referred to the agreement as &quot;a compromise which we’ve agreed upon to safeguard our future.&quot;

== Infrastructure ==

===Roads===
On Kwajalein Island the primary mode of personal transportation is the bicycle.

===Airports===
There are two airbases and three airstrips on Kwajalein Atoll:

* Bucholz Army Airfield to the south at Kwajalein: 
* Dyess Army Airfield to the north at Roi-Namur: 
* Ebadon Airstrip to the west at Ebadon: 
* Elenak Airport on Mejato: 
* Meck Island Airstrip, an eastern island, between Roi-Namur and Kwajalein: 

===Water===
Water is collected or generated on Kwajalein Island and distributed by barge to Meck, Illeginni, and Gugeegue. Kwaj collects rainfall from the runway into a catch basin where it is stored and treated. A secondary source is from &quot;skim wells&quot; on Kwaj and Roi-Namur. Rain percolates through the coral during the wet season. The third method is the evaporation of sea water. There are three steam evaporators on Kwaj. While the theoretical potential is daily, the practical limit is daily. This distillation is expensive and avoided, if possible.

Untreated water is filtered to remove 99% of the bacteria. It is then treated with 4–5 parts of chlorine per million and 0.7 parts per million of fluorine.

Sea water is used for sewage lines. The seawater sewage treatment used for flushing latrine system was abandoned and pumping systems rehabilitated in 1980 (Global Logistics 1980) and an activated sludge treatment plant was built on the Western area near Fuel Pier. The wastewater treatment plant is a tertiary treatment plant that provides reclaimed water for non potable usage such as toilets, industrial uses, and the island&#x27;s irrigation system.

==Education==
Marshall Islands Public School System operates public schools for local Marshallese.

High schools:
* Kwajalein Atoll High School (KAHS)

Primary schools:
* Carlos Elementary School
* Ebadon Elementary School
* Ebeye Kindergarten
* Ebeye Public Elementary School
* Ebeye Public Middle School
* Eniburr Elementary School
* Mejatto Elementary School on Mejatto serves Ronglap people

In the 1994–1995 school year Kwajalein had three private high schools.

AVID (formerly DynCorp International) operates two schools for dependents of US military and civilian employees, George Seitz Elementary School (K-6) and Kwajalein Jr./Sr. High School (7–12).

==Twin towns==
Kwajalein is twinned with:
* Taichung City, Taiwan, since 2002

== Popular culture ==
The atoll is the setting of a clandestine spacecraft launch site in Neal Shusterman&#x27;s third novel in his Arc of a Scythe series, &quot;The Toll&quot;.

<text>In finance, a call option, often simply labeled a &quot;call&quot;, is a contract between the buyer and the seller of the call option to exchange a security at a set price. The buyer of the call option has the right, but not the obligation, to buy an agreed quantity of a particular commodity or financial instrument (the underlying) from the seller of the option at or before a certain time (the expiration date) for a certain price (the strike price). This effectively gives the buyer a &quot;long&quot; position in the given asset. The seller (or &quot;writer&quot;) is obliged to sell the commodity or financial instrument to the buyer if the buyer so decides. This effectively gives the seller a &quot;short&quot; position in the given asset. The buyer pays a fee (called a premium) for this right. The term &quot;call&quot; comes from the fact that the owner has the right to &quot;call the stock away&quot; from the seller.

==Price of options==
Option values vary with the value of the underlying instrument over time. The price of the call contract must act as a proxy response for the valuation of:
* the expected intrinsic value of the option, defined as the expected value of the difference between the strike price and the market value, i.e., max[S−X, 0].
* the risk premium to compensate for the unpredictability of the value
* the time value of money reflecting the delay to the payout time
The call contract price generally will be higher when the contract has more time to expire (except in cases when a significant dividend is present) and when the underlying financial instrument shows more volatility or other unpredictability. Determining this value is one of the central functions of financial mathematics. The most common method used is the Black–Scholes model, which provides an estimate of the price of European-style options.

<text>Amiternum was an ancient Sabine city, then Roman city and later bishopric and Latin Catholic titular see in the central Abruzzo region of modern Italy, located from L&#x27;Aquila. Amiternum was the birthplace of the historian Sallust (86 BC).

==History==
The site, in the upper Aterno valley, was one of the most important of Sabinum.

Amiternum was defeated by the Romans in 293 BC.

It lay at the point of junction of four roads: the Via Caecilia, the Via Claudia Nova and two branches of the Via Salaria. 

There are considerable remains of an amphitheatre and a theatre, all of which belong to the imperial period, while on the hill of the surrounding village of San Vittorino there are some Christian catacombs.

A well known Roman funerary relief of the first century BC depicts the Roman funeral procession or &quot;pompa&quot;.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
The modern name of the locality, San Vittorino, recalls the martyr Victorinus, who is looked on as the first bishop of Amiternum, allegedly of the time of the persecution by Roman Emperor Nerva (AD 30-98), although other sources put the bishopric&#x27;s foundation in ca. AD 300. Around AD 400 it gained territory from the suppressed Diocese of Pitinum.

Other bishops of Amiternum include Quodvultdeus, who encouraged the religious veneration of Victorinus by constructing his tomb, Castorius, who is mentioned by Pope Gregory I, Saint Cetteus, martyred by the Lombards in 597, and Leontius, a brother of Pope Stephen II. The last known bishop is Ludovicus, who took part in a synod held in Rome in 1069.
Circa AD 1060, the bishopric was suppressed and its territory merged into the Rieti. In the mid-13th century the population was transferred to the newly founded town of L&#x27;Aquila, which was erected as a diocese by Pope Alexander IV on 20 February 1257, and incorporated the territory of the diocese of Amiternum.

=== Titular see ===
No longer a residential bishopric, the name Amiternum has been used by the Catholic Church since 1966 as a Latin titular bishopric.

It has had the following incumbents:
* Titular Bishop Stanislao Amilcare Battistelli, Passionists (C.P.) (1967.02.22 – 1976.01.06)
* Titular Archbishop Agostino Cacciavillan (1976.01.17 – 2001.02.21), 
** as papal diplomat (Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Kenya (1976.01.17 – 1981.05.09), 
** Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to India (1981.05.09 – 1990.06.13), 
** Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Nepal (1985.04.30 – 1990.06.13), 
** Permanent Observer to Organization of American States (OAS) (1990 – 1998.11.05), 
** Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to United States of America (1990.06.13 – 1998.11.05)), 
** President of Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See (1998.11.05 – 2002.10.01)
* Titular Archbishop Timothy Paul Andrew Broglio (2001.02.27 – 2007.11.19)
* Titular Archbishop Luciano Suriani (2008.02.22 – ...)

<text> (), known by his pen name Hafez ( ; 1325–1390) or Hafiz, was a Persian lyric poet whose collected works are regarded by many Iranians as one of the highest pinnacles of Persian literature. His works are often found in the homes of Persian speakers, who learn his poems by heart and use them as everyday proverbs and sayings. His life and poems have become the subjects of much analysis, commentary, and interpretation, influencing post-14th century Persian writing more than any other Persian author.

Hafez is best known for his &quot;Divān&quot;, a collection of his surviving poems probably compiled after his death. His works can be described as &quot;antinomian&quot; and with the medieval use of the term &quot;theosophical&quot;; the term &quot;theosophy&quot; in the 13th and 14th centuries was used to indicate mystical work by &quot;authors only inspired by the Islamic holy books&quot; (as distinguished from theology). Hafez primarily wrote in the literary genre of lyric poetry or ghazals, which is the ideal style for expressing the ecstasy of divine inspiration in the mystical form of love poems. He was a Sufi.

Themes of his ghazals include the beloved, faith and exposing hypocrisy. In his ghazals, he deals with love, wine and taverns, all presenting religious ecstasy and freedom from restraint, whether in actual worldly release or in the voice of the lover. His influence on Persian speakers appears in divination by his poems (, somewhat similar to the Roman tradition of &quot;Sortes Vergilianae&quot;) and in the frequent use of his poems in Persian traditional music, visual art and Persian calligraphy. His tomb is located in his birthplace of Shiraz. Adaptations, imitations, and translations of his poems exist in all major languages.

==Life==

Hafez was born in Shiraz, Iran. Few details of his life are known. Accounts of his early life rely upon traditional anecdotes. Early &quot;tazkiras&quot; (biographical sketches) mentioning Hafez are generally considered unreliable. At an early age, he memorized the Quran. He was given the title of &quot;Hafez&quot;, which he later used as his pen name. The preface of his Divān, in which his early life is discussed, was written by an unknown contemporary whose name may have been Moḥammad Golandām. Two of the most highly regarded modern editions of Hafez&#x27;s &quot;Divān&quot; are compiled by Allame Mohammad Qazvini and Qāsem Ghani (495 ghazals) and by Parviz Natel-Khanlari (486 ghazals). Hafez was a Sufi Muslim.

Modern scholars generally agree that he was born either in 1315 or 1317. According to an account by Jami, Hafez died in 1390. He was supported by patronage from several successive local regimes: Shah Abu Ishaq, who came to power while Hafez was in his teens; Timur at the end of his life; and even the strict ruler Shah Mubariz ud-Din Muhammad (Mubariz Muzaffar). Though his work flourished most under the 27-year rule of Jalal ud-Din Shah Shuja (Shah Shuja), it is claimed Hāfez briefly fell out of favor with Shah Shuja for mocking inferior poets (Shah Shuja wrote poetry himself and may have taken the comments personally), forcing Hāfez to flee from Shiraz to Isfahan and Yazd, however, no historical evidence is available. Hafez also exchanged letters and poetry with Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah, the Sultan of Bengal, who invited him to Sonargaon though he could not make it.

Twenty years after his death, a tomb was erected to honor Hafez in the Musalla Gardens in Shiraz. The current mausoleum was designed by André Godard, a French archeologist and architect, in the late 1930s, and the tomb is raised on a dais amidst rose gardens, water channels, and orange trees. Inside, Hafez&#x27;s alabaster sarcophagus bears the inscription of two of his poems.

==Legends==
Many semi-miraculous mythical tales were woven around Hafez after his death. It is said that by listening to his father&#x27;s recitations, Hafez had accomplished the task of learning the Quran by heart at an early age (that is the meaning of the word &quot;Hafez&quot;). At the same time, he is said to have known by heart the works of Rumi, Saadi, Attar Neyshapuri, and Nizami Ganjavi.

According to one tradition, before meeting his self-chosen Sufi master Hajji Zayn al-Attar, Hafez had been working in a bakery, delivering bread to a wealthy quarter of the town. There, he first saw Shakh-e Nabat, a woman of great beauty, to whom some of his poems are addressed. Ravished by her beauty but knowing that his love for her would not be requited, he allegedly held his first mystic vigil in his desire to realize this union. Still, he encountered a being of surpassing beauty who identified himself as an angel, and his further attempts at union became mystic; a pursuit of spiritual union with the divine. 

At 60, he is said to have begun a chilla-nashini, a 40-day-and-night vigil by sitting in a circle that he had drawn for himself. On the 40th day, he once again met with Zayn al-Attar on what is known to be their fortieth anniversary and was offered a cup of Shirazi wine. It was there where he is said to have attained &quot;Cosmic Consciousness&quot;. He hints at this episode in one of his verses in which he advises the reader to attain &quot;clarity of wine&quot; by letting it &quot;sit for 40 days&quot;.

In one tale, Timur angrily summoned Hafez to account for one of his verses:
&lt;poem&gt;
&#x27;agar &#x27;ān Tork-e Šīrāzī * be dast ārad del-ē mā-rā
be khāl-ē Hendu-yaš baxšam * Samarqand ō Boxārā-rā&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
If that Shirazi Turk accepts my heart in their hand,
for their Indian mole I will give Samarkand and Bukhara.&lt;/poem&gt;

Samarkand was Timur&#x27;s capital and Bukhara was the kingdom&#x27;s finest city. &quot;With the blows of my lustrous sword&quot;, Timur complained, &quot;I have subjugated most of the habitable globe... to embellish Samarkand and Bokhara, the seats of my government; and you would sell them for the black mole of some girl in Shiraz!&quot;

Hafez, the tale goes, bowed deeply and replied, &quot;Alas, O Prince, it is this prodigality which is the cause of the misery in which you find me&quot;. So surprised and pleased was Timur with this response that he dismissed Hafez with handsome gifts.

==Influence==

===Intellectual and artistic legacy===
Hafez was acclaimed throughout the Islamic world during his lifetime, with other Persian poets imitating his work, and offers of patronage from Baghdad to India.

His work was first translated into English in 1771 by William Jones. It would leave a mark on such Western writers as Thoreau, Goethe, W. B. Yeats, in his prose anthology book of essays, &quot;Discoveries&quot;, as well as gaining a positive reception within West Bengal, in India, among some of the most prolific religious leaders and poets in this province, Debendranath Tagore, Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s father, who knew Persian and used to recite from Hafez&#x27;s Divans and in this line, Gurudev himself, who, during his visit to Persia in 1932, also made a homage visit to Hafez&#x27;s tomb in Shiraz and Ralph Waldo Emerson (the last referred to him as &quot;a poet&#x27;s poet&quot;). Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has his character Sherlock Holmes state that &quot;there is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world&quot; (in A Case of Identity). Friedrich Engels mentioned him in an 1853 letter to Karl Marx.

There is no definitive version of his collected works (or &quot;Dīvān&quot;); editions vary from 573 to 994 poems. Only since the 1940s has a sustained scholarly attempt (by Mas&#x27;ud Farzad, Qasim Ghani and others in Iran) been made to authenticate his work and to remove errors introduced by later copyists and censors. However, the reliability of such work has been questioned, and in the words of Hāfez scholar Iraj Bashiri, &quot;there remains little hope from there (i.e., Iran) for an authenticated diwan&quot;.

===In contemporary Iranian culture===
Hafez is the most popular poet in Iran. His works can be found in almost every Iranian home. In fact, October 12 is celebrated as Hafez Day in Iran.
His tomb is &quot;crowded with devotees&quot; who visit the site and the atmosphere is &quot;festive&quot; with visitors singing and reciting their favorite Hafez poems.

Many Iranians use Divan of Hafez for bibliomancy. Iranian families usually have a &quot;Divan&quot; in their house, and when they get together during the Nowruz or Yaldā Night, they open it to a random page and read the poem on it, which they believe to be an indication of things that will happen in the future.

===In Iranian music===
In the genre of Persian traditional music, Hafez, along with Saadi Shirazi, have been the most popular poets in the art of āvāz, non-metered form of singing. Also the form &#x27;Sāqi-Nāmeh&#x27; in the radif of Persian music is based on the same title by Hafez. A number of contemporary composers such as Parviz Meshkatian (Sheydaie), Hossein Alizadeh (Ahu-ye Vahshi), Mohammad Reza Lotfi (Golestān), and Siamak Aghaie (Yād Bād) have composed metric songs (tasnif) based on ghazals of Hafez which have become very popular in the genre of classical music. Hayedeh performed the song &quot;Padeshah-e Khooban&quot;, with music by Farid Zoland. The Ottoman composer Buhurizade Mustafa Itri composed his magnum opus Neva Kâr based upon one of Hafez&#x27;s poems. The Polish composer Karol Szymanowski composed The Love Songs of Hafiz based upon a German translation of Hafez poems.

===In Afghan music===
Many Afghan singers, including Ahmad Zahir and Abdul Rahim Sarban, have composed songs such as &quot;Ay Padeshah-e Khooban&quot;, &quot;Gar-Zulfe Parayshanat&quot;.

==Interpretation==

The question of whether his work is to be interpreted literally, mystically, or both has been a source of contention among western scholars. On the one hand, some of his early readers such as William Jones saw in him a conventional lyricist similar to European love poets such as Petrarch. Others scholars such as Henry Wilberforce Clarke saw him as purely a poet of didactic, ecstatic mysticism in the manner of Rumi, a view that a minority of twentieth century critics and literary historians have come to challenge. Ralph Waldo Emerson rejected the Sufistic view of wine in Hafez&#x27;s poems.

This confusion stems from the fact that, early in Persian literary history, the poetic vocabulary was usurped by mystics, who believed that the ineffable could be better approached in poetry than in prose. In composing poems of mystic content, they imbued every word and image with mystical undertones, causing mysticism and lyricism to converge into a single tradition. As a result, no fourteenth-century Persian poet could write a lyrical poem without having a flavor of mysticism forced on it by the poetic vocabulary itself. While some poets, such as Ubayd Zakani, attempted to distance themselves from this fused mystical-lyrical tradition by writing satires, Hafez embraced the fusion and thrived on it. Wheeler Thackston has said of this that Hafez &quot;sang a rare blend of human and mystic love so balanced... that it is impossible to separate one from the other&quot;.

For reasons such as that, the history of the translation of Hāfez is fraught with complications, and few translations into western languages have been wholly successful.

One of the figurative gestures for which he is most famous (and which is among the most difficult to translate) is &quot;īhām&quot; or artful punning. Thus, a word such as &quot;gowhar&quot;, which could mean both &quot;essence, truth&quot; and &quot;pearl&quot;, would take on &quot;both&quot; meanings at once as in a phrase such as &quot;a pearl/essential truth outside the shell of superficial existence&quot;.

Hafez often took advantage of the aforementioned lack of distinction between lyrical, mystical, and panegyric writing by using highly intellectualized, elaborate metaphors and images to suggest multiple possible meanings. For example, a couplet from one of Hafez&#x27;s poems reads:
The cypress tree is a symbol both of the beloved and of a regal presence; the nightingale and birdsong evoke the traditional setting for human love. The &quot;lessons of spiritual stations&quot; suggest, obviously, a mystical undertone as well (though the word for &quot;spiritual&quot; could also be translated as &quot;intrinsically meaningful&quot;). Therefore, the words could signify at once a prince addressing his devoted followers, a lover courting a beloved, and the reception of spiritual wisdom.

== Satire, religion, and politics ==

Though Hafez is well known for his poetry, he is less commonly recognized for his intellectual and political contributions. A defining feature of Hafez&#x27; poetry is its ironic tone and the theme of hypocrisy, widely believed to be a critique of the religious and ruling establishments of the time. Persian satire developed during the 14th century, within the courts of the Mongol Empire. In this period, Hafez and other notable early satirists, such as Ubayd Zakani, produced a body of work that has since become a template for the use of satire as a political device. Many of his critiques are believed to be targeted at the rule of Mubariz al-Din Muhammad, specifically, towards the disintegration of important public and private institutions.

His work, particularly his imaginative references to monasteries, convents, Shahneh, and muhtasib, ignored the religious taboos of his period, and he found humor in some of his society&#x27;s religious doctrines. Employing humor polemically has since become a common practice in Iranian public discourse and satire is now perhaps the de facto language of Iranian social commentary.
Hafez had been influenced by ancient Iran and Zoroastrian religion and the terminology of this religion has been consistently used in his poems. Examples are &quot;Mogh&quot;, &quot;Mogh-bache&quot;, &quot;Jamshid&quot; etc. Moreover it seems that he has had the aspiration of reviving this religion. In some verses he explicitly shows his interest to this issue. As an example in a verse he says: &quot;in the garden, renew the rituals of Zoroastrian religion...now that Nimrood fire have grown tulips&quot;. In another verse he says: &quot;the reason I am loved in the magis circle...is the eternal fire that is my soul&quot;.

==Modern English editions==
A standard modern English edition of Hafez is &quot;Faces of Love&quot; (2012) translated by Dick Davis for Penguin Classics. &quot;Beloved: 81 poems from Hafez&quot; (Bloodaxe Books, 2018) translated by Mario Petrucci, is a recent English selection, noted by Fatemeh Keshavarz (Roshan Institute for Persian studies, University of Maryland) for preserving &quot;that audacious and multilayered richness one finds in the originals&quot;.

Peter Avery translated a complete edition of Hafez in English, &quot;The Collected Lyrics of Hafiz of Shiraz&quot;, published in 2007. It was awarded Iran&#x27;s Farabi prize. Avery&#x27;s translations are published with notes explaining allusions in the text and filling in what the poets would have expected their readers to know. An abridged version exists, titled &quot;Hafiz of Shiraz: Thirty Poems: An Introduction to the Sufi Master&quot;.

== Divan-e-Hafez ==
Divan Hafez is a book containing all the remaining poems of Hafez. Most of these poems are in Persian and the most crucial part of this Divan is ghazals. There are poems in other poetic formats such as piece, ode, Masnavi and quatrain in this Divan.

There is no evidence that most of Hafez&#x27;s poems were destroyed. In addition, Hafez was very famous during his lifetime; Therefore, the small number of poetry in the court indicates that he was not a prolific poet.

Hafez&#x27;s Divan was probably compiled for the first time by Mohammad Glendam after his death. Of course, some unconfirmed reports indicate that Hafez published his court in AH 770 (1368). that is, edited more than twenty years before his death.

== Death and the tomb ==

The year of Hafez&#x27;s death is AH 791 (1389). Hafez was buried in the prayer hall of Shiraz called hafezieh. In AH 855 (1451), after the conquest of Shiraz by Abolghasem Babar Teymouri, they built a tomb under the command of his minister, Maulana Mohammad Mamaei.

<text>Faridoddin Abu Hamed Mohammad Attar Nishapuri ( – c. 1221; ), better known by his pen-names Faridoddin () and ʿAttar of Nishapur (, Attar means apothecary), was a poet, theoretician of Sufism, and hagiographer from Nishapur who had an immense and lasting influence on Persian poetry and Sufism. He wrote a collection of lyrical poems and number of long poems in the philosophical tradition of Islamic mysticism, as well as a prose work with biographies and sayings of famous Muslim mystics. &quot;The Conference of the Birds&quot;, &quot;Book of the Divine&quot;, and&quot; Memorial of the Saints&quot; are among his best known works.

==Biography==
Information about Attar&#x27;s life is scarce and has been mythologised over the centuries. However, Attar was born to a Persian family and he practised the profession of pharmacist and personally attended to a very large number of customers. He is mentioned by only two of his contemporaries, `Awfi and Tusi. However, all sources confirm that he was from Nishapur, a major city of medieval Khorasan (now located in the northeast of Iran), and according to `Awfi, he was a poet of the Seljuq period.

According to Reinert: &quot;It seems that he was not well known as a poet in his own lifetime, except at his home town,&quot; and &quot;his greatness as a mystic, a poet, and a master of narrative was not discovered until the 15th century.&quot; At the same time, the mystic Persian poet Rumi has mentioned: &quot;Attar was the spirit, Sanai his eyes twain, And in time thereafter, Came we in their train&quot; and mentions in another poem:

&quot;Attar travelled through all the seven cities of love&quot;

&quot; While I am only at the bend of the first alley.&quot;.

Attar was probably the son of a prosperous chemist, receiving an excellent education in various fields. While his works say little else about his life, they tell us that he practised the profession of pharmacy and personally attended to a very large number of customers. The people he helped in the pharmacy used to confide their troubles in Attar and this affected him deeply. Eventually, he abandoned his pharmacy store and travelled widely - to Baghdad, Basra, Kufa, Mecca, Medina, Damascus, Khwarizm, Turkistan, and India, meeting with Sufi Shaykhs - and returned promoting Sufi ideas. Attar was a Sunni Muslim.

From childhood onward Attar, encouraged by his father, was interested in the Sufis and their sayings and way of life, and regarded their saints as his spiritual guides. At the age of 78, Attar died a violent death in the massacre which the Mongols inflicted on Nishapur in April 1221. Today, his mausoleum is located in Nishapur. It was built by Ali-Shir Nava&#x27;i in the 16th century and later underwent a total renovation during the rule of Reza Shah in 1940.

==Teachings==
The thoughts depicted in Attar&#x27;s works reflect the whole evolution of the Sufi movement. The starting point is the idea that the body-bound soul&#x27;s awaited release and return to its source in the other world can be experienced during the present life in mystic union attainable through inward purification. In explaining his thoughts, Attar uses material not only from specifically Sufi sources but also from older ascetic legacies. Although his heroes are for the most part Sufis and ascetics, he also introduces stories from historical chronicles, collections of anecdotes, and all types of high-esteemed literature. His talent for perception of deeper meanings behind outward appearances enables him to turn details of everyday life into illustrations of his thoughts. The idiosyncrasy of Attar&#x27;s presentations invalidates his works as sources for study of the historical persons whom he introduces. As sources on the hagiology and phenomenology of Sufism, however, his works have immense value.

Judging from Attar&#x27;s writings, he approached the available Aristotelian heritage with scepticism and dislike. He did not seem to want to reveal the secrets of nature. This is particularly remarkable in the case of medicine, which fell well within the scope of his professional expertise as pharmacist. He obviously had no motive for sharing his expert knowledge in the manner customary among court panegyrists, whose type of poetry he despised and never practised. Such knowledge is only brought into his works in contexts where the theme of a story touches on a branch of the natural sciences.

According to Edward G. Browne, Attar as well as Rumi and Sana&#x27;i, were Sunni as evident from the fact that their poetry abounds with praise for the first two caliphs Abu Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattāb - who are detested by Shia mysticism. According to Annemarie Schimmel, the tendency among Shia authors to include leading mystical poets such as Rumi and Attar among their own ranks, became stronger after the introduction of Twelver Shia as the state religion in the Safavid Empire in 1501.

==Poetry==
Attar&#x27;s most famous poem by far is his Conference of the Birds (&quot;Mantiq al-tayr&quot;). Like many of his other poems, it is in the mathnawi genre of rhyming couplets. While the mathnawi genre of poetry may use a variety of different metres, Attar adopted a particular meter, that was later imitated by Rumi in his famous Mathnawi-yi Ma’nawi, which then became the mathnawi metre par excellence. The first recorded use of this metre for a mathnawi poem took place at the Nizari Ismaili fortress of Girdkuh between 1131 and 1139. It likely set the stage for later poetry in this style by mystics such as Attar and Rumi.

In the introductions of &quot;Mukhtār-Nāma&quot; () and &quot;Khusraw-Nāma&quot; (), Attar lists the titles of further products of his pen:

* &quot;Dīwān&quot; ()
* &quot;Asrār-Nāma&quot; ()
* &quot;Manṭiq-uṭ-Ṭayr&quot; (), also known as &quot;Maqāmāt-uṭ-Ṭuyūr&quot; ()
* &quot;Muṣībat-Nāma&quot; ()
* &quot;Ilāhī-Nāma&quot; ()
* &quot;Jawāhir-Nāma&quot; ()
* &quot;Šarḥ al-Qalb&quot; ()

He also states, in the introduction of the &quot;Mukhtār-Nāma&quot;, that he destroyed the &quot;Jawāhir-Nāma&#x27; and the &quot;Šarḥ al-Qalb&quot; with his own hand.

Although the contemporary sources confirm only Attar&#x27;s authorship of the &quot;Dīwān&quot; and the &quot;Manṭiq-uṭ-Ṭayr&quot;, there are no grounds for doubting the authenticity of the &quot;Mukhtār-Nāma&quot; and &quot;Khusraw-Nāma&quot; and their prefaces. One work is missing from these lists, namely the &quot;Tadhkirat-ul-Awliyā&quot;, which was probably omitted because it is a prose work; its attribution to Attar is scarcely open to question. In its introduction Attar mentions three other works of his, including one entitled &quot;Šarḥ al-Qalb&quot;, presumably the same that he destroyed. The nature of the other two, entitled &quot;Kašf al-Asrār&quot; () and &quot;Maʿrifat al-Nafs&quot; (), remains unknown.

===&quot;Manṭiq-uṭ-Ṭayr&quot;===

In the poem, the birds of the world gather to decide who is to be their sovereign, as they have none. The hoopoe, the wisest of them all, suggests that they should find the legendary Simorgh. The hoopoe leads the birds, each of whom represents a human fault which prevents human kind from attaining enlightenment.

The hoopoe tells the birds that they have to cross seven valleys in order to reach the abode of Simorgh. These valleys are as follows:

: &quot;1. Valley of the Quest, where the Wayfarer begins by casting aside all dogma, belief, and unbelief.&quot;
: &quot;2. Valley of Love, where reason is abandoned for the sake of love.&quot;
: &quot;3. Valley of Knowledge, where worldly knowledge becomes utterly useless.&quot;
: &quot;4. Valley of Detachment, where all desires and attachments to the world are given up. Here, what is assumed to be “reality” vanishes.&quot;
: &quot;5. Valley of Unity, where the Wayfarer realises that everything is connected and that the Beloved is beyond everything, including harmony, multiplicity, and eternity.&quot;
: &quot;6. Valley of Wonderment, where, entranced by the beauty of the Beloved, the Wayfarer becomes perplexed and, steeped in awe, finds that he or she has never known or understood anything.&quot;
: &quot;7. Valley of Poverty and Annihilation, where the self disappears into the universe and the Wayfarer becomes timeless, existing in both the past and the future.&quot;

Sholeh Wolpé writes, &quot;When the birds hear the description of these valleys, they bow their heads in distress; some even die of fright right then and there. But despite their trepidations, they begin the great journey. On the way, many perish of thirst, heat or illness, while others fall prey to wild beasts, panic, and violence. Finally, only thirty birds make it to the abode of Simorgh. In the end, the birds learn that they themselves are the Simorgh; the name “Simorgh” in Persian means thirty (si) birds (morgh). They eventually come to understand that the majesty of that Beloved is like the sun that can be seen reflected in a mirror. Yet, whoever looks into that mirror will also behold his or her own image.

: &quot;If Simorgh unveils its face to you, you will find&quot; 
: &quot;that all the birds, be they thirty or forty or more,&quot;
: &quot;are but the shadows cast by that unveiling.&quot;
: &quot;What shadow is ever separated from its maker?&quot; 
: &quot;Do you see?&quot;
: &quot;The shadow and its maker are one and the same,&quot; 
: &quot;so get over surfaces and delve into mysteries.&quot;&quot;&quot;

Attar&#x27;s masterful use of symbolism is a key, driving component of the poem. This adroit handling of symbolisms and allusions can be seen reflected in these lines:

 Beside the symbolic use of the Simorgh, the allusion to China is also very significant. According to Idries Shah, China as used here, is not the geographical China, but the symbol of mystic experience, as inferred from the Hadith (declared weak by Ibn Adee, but still used symbolically by some Sufis): &quot;Seek knowledge; even as far as China&quot;.[5] There are many more examples of such subtle symbols and allusions throughout the Mantiq. Within the larger context of the story of the journey of the birds, Attar masterfully tells the reader many didactic short, sweet stories in captivating poetic style.

===Tadhkirat-ul-Awliyā===

The Tadhkirat-ul-Awliyā, a hagiographic collection of Muslim saints and mystics, is Attar&#x27;s only known prose work. Written and compiled throughout much of his life and published before his death, the compelling account of the execution of the mystic Mansur al-Hallaj, who had uttered the words &quot;I am the Truth&quot; in a state of ecstatic contemplation, is perhaps the most well known extract from the book.

===&quot;Ilāhī-Nāma&quot;===

The &quot;Ilāhī-Nāma&quot; () or &quot;Elāhī-Nāme(h)&quot; is another famous poetic work of Attar, consisting of 6500 verses. In terms of form and content, it has some similarities with Bird Parliament. The story is about a king who is confronted with the materialistic and worldly demands of his six sons. The King tries to show the temporary and senseless desires of his six sons by retelling them a large number of spiritual stories. The first son asks for the daughter of the king of the fairies, the second for the mastery of magic, the third for the cup of Jamshid, which has the property of displaying the whole world, the fourth for the water of life, the fifth for the ring of Solomon, which has control over fairies and demons, and the sixth for mastering alchemy. Each of these desires is discussed first literally, and shown to be absurd, and then it is explained how there is an esoteric interpretation of each one.

===&quot;Mukhtār-Nāma&quot;===
&quot;Mukhtār-Nāma&quot; (), a wide-ranging collection of quatrains (2088 in number). In the Mokhtar-nama, a coherent group of mystical and religious subjects is outlined (search for union, sense of uniqueness, distancing from the world, annihilation, amazement, pain, awareness of death, etc.), and an equally rich group of themes typical of lyrical poetry of erotic inspiration adopted by mystical literature (the torment of love, impossible union, beauty of the loved one, stereotypes of the love story as weakness, crying, separation).

===Divan===
The Diwan of Attar () consists almost entirely of poems in the Ghazal (&quot;lyric&quot;) form, as he collected his Ruba&#x27;i (&quot;quatrains&quot;) in a separate work called the Mokhtar-nama. There are also some Qasida (&quot;Odes&quot;), but they amount to less than one-seventh of the Divan. His Qasidas expound upon mystical and ethical themes and moral precepts. They are sometimes modelled after Sanai. The Ghazals often seem from their outward vocabulary just to be love and wine songs with a predilection for libertine imagery, but generally imply spiritual experiences in the familiar symbolic language of classical Islamic Sufism. Attar&#x27;s lyrics express the same ideas that are elaborated in his epics. His lyric poetry does not significantly differ from that of his narrative poetry, and the same may be said of the rhetoric and imagery.

==Legacy==
===Influence on Rumi===
Attar is one of the most famous mystic poets of Iran. His works were the inspiration of Rumi and many other mystic poets. Attar, along with Sanai were two of the greatest influences on Rumi in his Sufi views. Rumi has mentioned both of them with the highest esteem several times in his poetry. Rumi praises Attar as follows:

===As a pharmacist===
Attar was a pen-name which he took for his occupation. Attar means herbalist, druggist, perfumist or alchemist, and during his lifetime in Persia, much of medicine and drugs were based on herbs. Therefore, by profession he was similar to a modern-day town doctor and pharmacist. Further, &quot;&#x27;Attar&quot; also refers to rose oil.

===In popular culture===
Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges used a summary reference to The Conference of the Birds in his short story, The Approach to Al-Mu&#x27;tasim (1936). The Ubuntu Theater Project in Berkeley California premiered an adaptation of Attar&#x27;s &quot;The Conference of the Birds&quot; by Sholeh Wolpe, in Oakland, California.

In an 1822 entry, the French writer François-René de Chateaubriand quoted a line, &quot;Palaces are not built on the sea,&quot; in &quot;Memoirs from Beyond the Grave, 1768-1800&quot;. Chateaubriand probably encountered &quot;Farid ud-Din&quot; through the 1819 translation of Silvestre de Sacy, &quot;Le Livre des Conseils.&quot;

<text>A mudlark is someone who scavenges the banks and shores of rivers for items of value, a term used especially to describe those who scavenged this way in London during the late 18th and 19th centuries. The practice of searching the banks of rivers for items continues in the modern era, with newer technology such as metal detectors sometimes being employed to search for metal valuables that may have washed ashore.

== Mudlarks in the 18th and 19th centuries ==
Mudlarks would search the muddy shores of the River Thames at low tide for anything that could be sold – sometimes, when occasion arose, pilfering from river traffic as well. By at least the late 18th century, people dwelling near the river could scrape a subsistence living this way. Mudlarks were usually either youngsters aged between 8 and 15, or the robust elderly, and though most mudlarks were male, girls and women were also scavengers.

Becoming a mudlark was usually a choice dictated by poverty and lack of skills. Work conditions were filthy and uncomfortable, as excrement and waste would wash onto the shores from the raw sewage and sometimes also the corpses of humans, cats and dogs. Mudlarks would often get cuts from broken glass left on the shore. The income generated was seldom more than meagre; but mudlarks had a degree of independence, since (subject to tides) the hours they worked were entirely at their own discretion and they also kept everything they made as a result of their own labour.

Henry Mayhew, in his book &quot;London Labour and the London Poor; Extra Volume&quot;, 1851, provides a detailed description of this category, and in a later edition of the same work includes the &quot;Narrative of a Mudlark&quot;, an interview with a thirteen-year-old boy, Martin Prior.

Although in 1904 a person could still claim &quot;mudlark&quot; as an occupation, by then it seems to have been no longer viewed as an acceptable or lawful pursuit. By 1936 the word is used merely to describe swimsuited London schoolchildren earning pocket money during the summer holidays by begging passers-by to throw coins into the Thames mud, which they then chased, to the amusement of the onlookers.

== Modern times ==

More recently, metal-detectorists and other individuals searching the foreshore for historic artefacts have described themselves as &quot;mudlarks&quot;. In London, a licence is required from the Port of London Authority for this activity and it is illegal to search for or remove artefacts of any kind from the foreshore without one. The regulations changed in 2016, making Ted Sandling&#x27;s book &quot;London in Fragments&quot; out of date in this respect. 

The PLA state that &quot;All the foreshore in the UK has an owner. Metal detecting, searching or digging is not a public right and as such it needs the permission of the landowner. The PLA and the Crown Estate are the largest land owners of Thames foreshore and jointly administer a permit which allows metal detecting, searching or digging.&quot; The PLA site has much useful information for permit holders including maps, rules &amp; regulations about where digging is and is not permitted, safety and tide tables.

Occasionally, objects of archaeological value have been recovered from the Thames foreshore. Dependent on their value, these are either reported as treasure under the Treasure Act 1996, or voluntarily submitted for analysis and review via the Portable Antiquities Scheme.

A BBC article in July 2020 recommended the Thames Discovery Programme, &quot;a group of historians and volunteers [running] guided tours&quot; for novice mudlarks, and in 2019 the book &quot;Mudlarking: Lost and Found on the River Thames&quot; by Lara Maiklem was first published. The author had considerable experience in searching the banks of the river for historical artefacts. &quot;Rag and Bone: A Family History of What We&#x27;ve Thrown Away&quot; by Lisa Woollett (2020) is another examination of the subject.

The Museum of London is happy with the outcome of the mudlarks that search the Thames. Finds Liaison Officer, Stuart Wyatt, said &quot;New, interesting artefacts are constantly being discovered by mudlarks and brought to the museum. Finds from the Thames are still giving us new information and adding to the collective knowledge. These objects are continuing to enhance our understanding of London’s history and the lives of Londoners who inhabited the city over the last two millennia.&quot;

<text>Algirdas Jonas &quot;Algis&quot; Budrys (January 9, 1931 – June 9, 2008) was a Lithuanian-American science fiction author, editor and critic. He was also known under the pen names Frank Mason, Alger Rome in collaboration with Jerome Bixby, John A. Sentry, William Scarff and Paul Janvier. In the 1990s he was the publisher and editor of the science fiction magazine &quot;Tomorrow Speculative Fiction&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Budrys was born in Königsberg, Germany (present-day Kaliningrad, Russia). His father Jonas Budrys was the consul general of Lithuania. In 1936, when Budrys was five years old, Jonas was appointed as the consul general in New York City. 

After the Soviet Union&#x27;s occupation of Lithuania in 1940, Budrys helped his family run a chicken farm in New Jersey while his father was part of the exiled Lithuanian Diplomatic Service, since the United States continued to recognize the pre-World War II Lithuanian diplomats.

Budrys was educated at the University of Miami and later at Columbia University in New York City.

===Career===
Incorporating his family&#x27;s experience, Budrys&#x27;s fiction depicts isolated and damaged people and themes of identity, survival and legacy. He taught himself English at the age of six by reading &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;. From &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; comic strips, Budrys read H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The Time Machine&quot;; &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; caused him at the age of 11 to want to become a science fiction writer. His first published science fiction story was &quot;The High Purpose&quot;, which appeared in &quot;Astounding&quot; in 1952. 

In 1952, Budrys worked as editor and manager for such science fiction publishers as Gnome Press and Galaxy Science Fiction. Some of Budrys&#x27;s science fiction in the 1950s was published under the pen name &quot;John A. Sentry&quot;, a reconfigured Anglification of his Lithuanian name. Among his other pseudonyms in the SF magazines of the 1950s and elsewhere, several revived as bylines for vignettes in his magazine &quot;Tomorrow Speculative Fiction&quot;, is &quot;William Scarff&quot;. Budrys also wrote several stories under the names &quot;Ivan Janvier&quot; or &quot;Paul Janvier&quot;, and used &quot;Alger Rome&quot; in his collaborations with Jerome Bixby.

Budrys&#x27;s 1960 novella &quot;Rogue Moon&quot; was nominated for a Hugo Award and was later anthologized in &quot;The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume Two&quot; (1973). His Cold War science fiction novel &quot;Who?&quot; was adapted for the screen in 1973. In addition to numerous Hugo Award and Nebula Award nominations, Budrys won the Science Fiction Research Association&#x27;s 2007 Pilgrim Award for lifetime contributions to speculative fiction scholarship. In 2009, he was the recipient of one of the first three Solstice Awards presented by the SFWA in recognition of his contributions to the field of science fiction.

Having published about 100 stories and a half-dozen novels, with a wife and children to support. After 1960 Budrys wrote less fiction and worked in publishing, editing and advertising. He became better known as among science fiction&#x27;s best critics than as writer, reviewing for &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, a book editor for &quot;Playboy&quot;, a longtime teacher at the Clarion Writers Workshop and an organizer and judge for the L. Ron Hubbard Writers and Illustrators of the Future contest. 

Budrys also worked as a publicist; in a famous publicity stunt, he erected a giant pickle on the proposed site of the Chicago Picasso during the time the newly arriving sculpture was embroiled in controversy.

===Death===
He last resided in Evanston, Illinois, where he died from metastatic malignant melanoma on June 9, 2008, at age 77.

<text>A pipe tool is a small gadget designed to aid in packing, smoking, and emptying a tobacco pipe.

There are three principal pipe tools: the tamper, the reamer, and the pick:

*The &quot;tamper&quot; is a blunt instrument, either a simple dowel or shaped like the head of a nail. The flat end is used to tamp down the tobacco while packing the pipe, and to crush the ash together during smoking or relighting. Tampers are often made with a notch or small holes to permit airflow so that tamping the tobacco does not extinguish the flame.
*The &quot;reamer&quot; or &quot;scoop&quot; is a flat instrument shaped like a dull knife blade or a flattened spoon, used to scrape ash and unburned tobacco (dottle) off the sides and bottom of a pipe.
*The &quot;pick&quot; or &quot;poker&quot; is a narrow rod or pin that can be used to clear the shank of debris or aerate tightly packed tobacco. Because it is sharp, it may scratch the bowl of a pipe and so should not be used for scraping.

These three tools can be combined in different ways. Most common is the three-in-one &quot;Czech tool&quot;, which consists of a tamper, reamer and pick joined together. A &quot;pipe knife&quot; is another three-in-one tool: the reamer and pick fold into the casing in the same fashion as a pocketknife, while the blunt end is used as a tamper. A &quot;pipe nail&quot; is a nail-shaped tool with a tamper at one end and a reamer at the other. Tampers and reamers are also made as separate tools.

<doc id="204273" wikidata="Q898808" url="?curid=204273" title="The Shepherd of Hermas">
<text>The Shepherd of Hermas (; ), sometimes just called The Shepherd, is a Christian literary work of the late first half of the second century, considered a valuable book by many Christians, and considered canonical scripture by some of the early Church fathers such as Irenaeus. &quot;The Shepherd&quot; was popular among Christians in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th centuries. It is found in the &quot;Codex Sinaiticus&quot;. The Muratorian fragment identifies the author of &quot;The Shepherd&quot; as Hermas, the brother of Pope Pius I.

==Language and translation==
The book was originally written in Rome in Koine Greek. A first Latin translation, the &quot;Vulgata&quot; (common language), was made very shortly afterwards. A second Latin translation, the &quot;Palatina&quot;, was made at the beginning of the fifth century. Of the Greek version, the last fifth or so is missing. The &quot;Vulgata&quot; is therefore the earliest translation and the most complete witness.

The &quot;Shepherd&quot; was also translated at least twice into the Coptic (Egyptian) language and fragments of translations in both the Sahidic and Akhmimic dialects survive. Three translations into Ge&#x27;ez (Ethiopic) were also made, but none survives complete. The sole surviving Georgian translation seems to have been made from an Arabic version, but no Arabic translation has been preserved. There does not appear to have been a Syriac translation and no Syriac author shows any awareness of the &quot;Shepherd&quot;. It was always more popular in the Western Roman Empire and in Alexandria than in the rest of the east. There was a Middle Persian translation made for a Manichaean readership, which survives in a single fragmentary manuscript found at Turfan in what is now China.

==Contents==

The book consists of five visions granted to Hermas, a former slave. This is followed by twelve mandates or commandments, and ten similitudes (aka parables). It commences abruptly in the first person: &quot;He who brought me up sold me to a certain Rhode, who was at Rome. After many years I met her again, and began to love her as a sister.&quot; As Hermas is on the road to Cumae, he has a vision of Rhoda. She tells him that she is now his accuser in heaven, on account of unchaste and impure thoughts the (now) married narrator once had regarding her. He is to repent and pray for forgiveness, for himself and all his house. He is consoled by a vision of the Church in the form of an aged woman, weak and helpless from the sins of her unfaithful children, who tells him to bear fruits of repentance and to correct the sins of his children. Subsequently, after his repentance he sees her made younger, yet still wrinkled and with white hair; then again, later she appears as quite young but still with white hair; and lastly, she shows herself as a glorious Bride.

This allegorical language continues through the other parts of the work. In the second vision she gives Hermas a book, which she later takes back in order to add to it. The fifth vision, which is represented as taking place 20 days after the fourth, introduces &quot;the Angel (Messenger) of repentance&quot; in the guise of a shepherd, from whom the whole work takes its name. He delivers to Hermas a series of precepts (&quot;mandata&quot;, &quot;entolai&quot;), which form an interesting development of early Christian ethics. One point which deserves special mention is the instruction of a Christian husband&#x27;s obligation to forgive and take back an adulterous wife upon her repentance. The eleventh mandate, on humility, is concerned with false prophets who desire to occupy the primary, or best seats (that is to say, among the presbyters). Some have seen here a reference to Marcion, who came to Rome and desired to be admitted among the priests (or possibly even to become bishop of Rome).

After the mandates come ten similitudes (&quot;parabolai&quot;) in the form of visions, which are explained by the angel. The longest of these (Similitude 9) is an elaboration of the parable of the building of a tower, which had formed the matter of the third vision. The tower is the Church, and the stones of which it is built are the faithful. In the third vision it looks as though only the holy are a part of the true Church; in Similitude 9 it is clearly pointed out that all the baptized are included, though they may be cast out for grave sins, and can be readmitted only after repentance.

==Authorship and date==
Textual criticism, the nature of the theology, and the author&#x27;s apparent familiarity with the Book of Revelation and other Johannine texts are thought to set the date of composition in the 2nd century. However, several ancient witnesses support an early dating and there is internal evidence for the place and date of this work in the language and theology of the work. The reference to an unknown Clement is presumed by some to be Clement of Rome; if this is that Clement, it would suggest a date c. 90 for at least the historicised setting of the first two visions. Since Paul sent greetings to a Hermas, a Christian of Rome (Romans 16:14), a minority have followed Origen of Alexandria&#x27;s opinion that he was the author of this religious allegory.

Three ancient witnesses claim to identify the author of this writing. These authorities may be citing the same source, perhaps Hegesippus, whose lost history of the early Church provided material for Eusebius of Caesarea. The witnesses are the Muratorian fragment, the Liberian Catalogue of Popes (a record that was later used in the writing of the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;) and a poem written by &quot;Pseudo-Tertullian&quot; in the 3rd or 4th century AD.

The Muratorian fragment, generally considered to have been written c. 170 AD (although a few scholars disagree with this dating), may be the earliest known canon of New Testament writings. It identifies Hermas, the author of &quot;The Shepherd&quot;, as the brother of Pius I, bishop of Rome:
== Theology ==
In parable 5, the author mentions a &quot;Son of God&quot;, as a virtuous man filled with a holy &quot;pre-existent spirit&quot; and adopted as the Son. In the 2nd century, adoptionism (the view that Jesus Christ was, at least initially, only a mortal man) was one of two competing doctrines about Jesus&#x27;s true nature, the other being that he pre-existed as the Word (&quot;Logos&quot;) or only-begotten Son of God and is to be identified as such from his conception; Christ&#x27;s identity as the Logos (Jn 1:1), in which the Logos is further understood to be uncreated and coessentially divine with God (that is, the Father), was affirmed in 325 at the First Council of Nicaea. Bogdan G. Bucur says the document was widely accepted among orthodox Christians, yet was not criticized for apparently exhibiting an adoptionistic Christology. He says that the passage in question should be understood as Jesus making his dwelling within those who submit to his spirit, so that the adoption that takes place is not of Jesus, but of his followers.

Some believe that Hermas has a binitarian understanding of God, as it calls the Holy Spirit the Son of God. Not all, however agree that Hermas has binitarianism. Kelly calls the Christology of Hermas &quot;an amalgam of binitarianism and adoptionism. 

Hermas has a synergist understanding of soteriology, where both works and faith are needed to be saved. For Hermas baptism is necessary to be saved and warns those who undergo baptism by the danger of postbaptismal sins. Shepherd of Hermas possibly supports delaying baptism for practical reasons which is because of the fear of post-baptismal sins. According to Hermas, those who fall into sin after baptism, have only one chance of penance.

The book has a high emphasis on morals and the work is an indication of Jewish Christianity—still keeping the Law of Moses.

Hermas has some similarities to Montanism, such as a support of a belief in prophetic gifts and disciplinarian rigorism, however a direct connection does not exist.

The principles which Novatian formulated have their origin in the Shepherd of Hermas.

Some have argued that Hermas is the first example of pre-tribulational rapture. Though Hermas does not mention a rapture, he writes of believers that &quot;have escaped from great tribulation on account of [their] faith&quot; and that others could also escape &quot;the great tribulation that is coming&quot;.

==Place in Christian literature==
Tertullian implies that Pope Callixtus I had quoted it as an authority (though evidently not as one of the books of the Bible), for he replies: &quot;I would admit your argument, if the writing of &quot;The Shepherd&quot; had deserved to be included in the Divine Instrument, and if it were not judged by every council of the Churches, even of your own Churches, among the apocryphal.&quot; And again, he says that the &quot;Epistle of Barnabas&quot;, which is Tertullian&#x27;s name for the New Testament Epistle to the Hebrews, is &quot;more received among the Churches than the apocryphal epistle of the Shepherd&quot;.

== Editions ==

<text>Anawrahta Minsaw (, ; 11 May 1014 – 11 April 1077) was the founder of the Pagan Empire. Considered the father of the Burmese nation, Anawrahta turned a small principality in the dry zone of Upper Burma into the first Burmese Empire that formed the basis of modern-day Burma (Myanmar). Historically verifiable Burmese history begins with his accession to the Pagan throne in 1044.

Anawrahta unified the entire Irrawaddy valley for the first time in history, and placed peripheral regions such as the Shan States and Arakan (Rakhine) under Pagan&#x27;s suzerainty. He successfully stopped the advance of the Khmer Empire into the Tenasserim coastline and into the Upper Menam valley, making Pagan one of the two great kingdoms in mainland Southeast Asia.

A strict disciplinarian, Anawrahta implemented a series of key social, religious and economic reforms that would have a lasting impact in Burmese history. His social and religious reforms later developed into the modern-day Burmese culture. By building a series of weirs, he turned parched, arid regions around Pagan into the main rice granaries of Upper Burma, giving Upper Burma an enduring economic base from which to dominate the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery in the following centuries. He bequeathed a strong administrative system that all later Pagan kings followed until the dynasty&#x27;s fall in 1287. The success and longevity of Pagan&#x27;s dominance over the Irrawaddy valley laid the foundation for the ascent of Burmese language and culture, the spread of Burman ethnicity in Upper Burma.

Anawrahta&#x27;s legacy went far beyond the borders of modern Burma. His embrace of Theravada Buddhism and his success in stopping the advance of Khmer Empire, a Mahayana state, provided the Buddhist school, which had been in retreat elsewhere in South and Southeast Asia, a much needed reprieve and a safe shelter. The success of Pagan dynasty made Theravada Buddhism&#x27;s later growth in Lan Na (northern Thailand), Siam (central Thailand), Lan Xang (Laos), and Khmer Empire (Cambodia) in the 13th and 14th centuries possible.

Anawrahta is one of the most famous kings in Burmese history. His life stories (legends) are a staple of Burmese folklore and retold in popular literature and theater.

==Early life==
Anawrahta was born Min Saw (, ) to King Kunhsaw Kyaunghpyu and Queen Myauk Pyinthe on 11 May 1044. The Burmese chronicles do not agree on the dates regarding his life and reign. The table below lists the dates given by the four main chronicles. Among the chronicles, scholarship usually accepts &quot;Zata&#x27;s&quot; dates, which are considered to be the most accurate for the Pagan period. Scholarship&#x27;s dates for Anawrahta&#x27;s birth, death and reign dates are closest to &quot;Zata&#x27;s&quot; dates.

In 1021, when Min Saw was about six years old, his father was deposed by his step-sons Kyiso and Sokkate. His father had been a usurper of the Pagan throne, who overthrew King Nyaung-u Sawrahan two decades earlier. Kunhsaw then married three of Nyaung-u&#x27;s chief queens, two of whom were pregnant at the time, and subsequently gave birth to Kyiso and Sokkate. Kunhsaw had raised Sokkate and Kyiso as his own sons. After the putsch, Kyiso became king and Sokkate became heir-apparent. They forced their step-father to a local monastery, where Kunhsaw would live as a monk for the remainder of his life.

Min Saw grew up in the shadow of his two step-brothers, who viewed Min Saw as their youngest brother and allowed him to retain his princely status at the court. Min Saw and his mother attended Kunhsaw, and lived nearby the monastery. In 1038, Kyiso died, and was succeeded by Sokkate. Min Saw was loyal to the new king. He took wives, and had at least two sons (Saw Lu and Kyansittha) by the early 1040s.

==Accession==

In 1044 however, Min Saw raised a rebellion at nearby Mount Popa, and challenged Sokkate to single combat. According to the chronicles, the reason for his uprising was that Sokkate had just raised Min Saw&#x27;s mother as queen. Sokkate is said to have addressed Min Saw as brother-son, which the latter took great offense. Sokkate accepted the challenge to single combat on horseback. On 11 August 1044, Min Saw slew Sokkate at Myinkaba, near Pagan. The king and his horse both fell into the river nearby.

Min Saw first offered the throne to his father. The former king, who had long been a monk, refused. On 16 December 1044, Min Saw ascended the throne with the title of Anawrahta, a Burmanized form of Sanskrit name Aniruddha (अनिरुद्ध). His full royal style was Maha Yaza Thiri Aniruddha Dewa (; ). Burmese history now begins to be less conjectural.

==Early reign: Consolidation of Central Burma==
In the beginning, Anawrahta&#x27;s principality was a small area—barely 200 miles north to south and about 80 miles from east to west, comprising roughly the present districts of Mandalay, Meiktila, Myingyan, Kyaukse, Yamethin, Magwe, Sagaing and Katha east of the Irrawaddy, and the riverine portions of Minbu and Pakkoku. To the north lay Nanzhao Kingdom, and to the east still largely uninhibited Shan Hills, to the south and the west the Pyus, and farther south still, the Mons.

===Economic reforms===
Anawrahta&#x27;s first acts as king were to organize his kingdom. He graded every town and village according to the levy it could raise. He made great efforts to turn the arid parched lands of central Burma into a rice granary. He constructed the irrigation system, which is still used in Upper Burma today. He repaired the Meiktila Lake, and successfully built four weirs and canals (Kinda, Nga Laingzin, Pyaungbya, Kume) on the Panlaung river, and three weirs (Nwadet, Kunhse, Nga Pyaung) on the Zawgyi. (He also tried to control the Myitnge river but failed despite all his efforts. The work lasted three years and there were many casualties from fever.) He peopled the newly developed areas with villages, which under royal officers served the canals. The region, known as Ledwin (lit. the rice country) became the granary, the economic key of the north country. History shows that one who gained control of Kyaukse became kingmaker in Upper Burma.

===Military organization===
Anawrahta organized Pagan&#x27;s military. His key men—known as the Four Great Paladins in Burmese history—were:
* Kyansittha, his son and lead general
* Nyaung-U Hpi, known as the great swimmer from Nyaung-U
* Nga Htwe Yu, former toddy tree climber from Myinmu (near Sagaing)
* Nga Lon Letpe, former farmer from near Mount Popa

Also at his service were Byatta (), a Muslim (likely an Arab seaman) shipwrecked at Thaton, and his sons Shwe Hpyin Gyi and Shwe Hpyin Nge, (who later entered the pantheon of Burmese folk deities as Shwe Hpyin Brothers ).

==Founding of Pagan Empire==

By the mid-1050s, Anawrahta&#x27;s reforms had turned Pagan into a regional power, and he looked to expand. Over the next ten years, he founded the Pagan Empire, the Irrawaddy valley at the core, surrounded by tributary kingdoms.

===Shan Hills===
His first efforts were in then lightly inhabited Shan Hills in the east and the north. He acquired allegiance of Shan Hills in two waves. In the early to mid-1050s, Anawrahta first visited the nearer Shan Hills in the east, and received tribute. He founded the Bawrithat Pagoda in Nyaungshwe. The second wave came in the late 1050s and early 1060s after his march to Nanzhao Kingdom. After his return from Nanzhao expedition, Shan chiefs along the route presented Anawrahta with tributes. Still, their allegiance was nominal and he had to establish 43 forts along the eastern foothills of which the following 33 still exist as villages.

The 43 forts were established per the royal order issued 7 February 1061 (12th waxing of Tabaung 422 ME).

===Lower Burma===
After his first Shan campaign, Anawrahta turned to the Mon-speaking kingdoms in the south, which like Pagan were merely large city-states in reality. He first received submission of the ruler of Pegu (Bago). But the Thaton Kingdom refused to submit. Anawrahta&#x27;s armies, led by the &quot;Four Paladins&quot;, invaded the southern kingdom in early 1057. After a 3-months&#x27; siege of the city of Thaton, on 17 May 1057, (11th waxing of Nayon, 419 ME), the Pagan forces conquered the city.

According to Burmese and Mon traditions, Anawrahta&#x27;s main reason for the invasion was Thaton king Manuha&#x27;s refusal to give him a copy of the Theravada Buddhist Canon. (Anawrahta had been converted to Theravada Buddhism from his native Ari Buddhism by Shin Arahan, a monk originally from Thaton.) In reality, it was merely a demand for submission couched in diplomatic language, and the real aim of his conquest of Thaton was to check the Khmer Empire&#x27;s conquests in the Chao Phraya basin and encroachment into the Tenasserim coast.

The conquest of Thaton is seen as the turning point in Burmese history. Still according to traditional reconstruction, Anawrahta brought back over 30,000 people, many of them artisans and craftsmen to Pagan. These captives formed a community that later helped build thousands of monuments at Pagan, the remains of which today rival the splendors of Angkor Wat.

More recent research by historian Michael Aung-Thwin has argued forcefully that Thaton&#x27;s contributions to the cultural transformation of Upper Burma are a post-Pagan legend without contemporary evidence, that Lower Burma in fact lacked a substantial independent polity prior to Pagan&#x27;s expansion, and that Mon influence on the interior is greatly exaggerated. Possibly in this period, the delta sedimentation—which now extends the coastline by three miles a century—remained insufficient, and the sea still reached too far inland, to support a population even as large as the modest population of the late precolonial era.

At any rate, during the 11th century, Pagan established its Lower Burma and this conquest facilitated growing cultural exchange, if not with local Mons, then with India and with Theravada stronghold Ceylon (Sri Lanka).

===Arakan===
Anawrahta&#x27;s next conquest was north Arakan (Rakhine). He marched over the pass from Ngape near Minbu to An in Kyaukphyu, and then laid siege to Pyinsa, then the capital of Arakan. He reportedly tried to bring home the giant Mahamuni Buddha but could not. He did take away the gold and silver vessels of the shrine.

There is no single unified Arakanese account to corroborate the event. Surviving Arakanese chronicles (from the 18th and 19th centuries) mention at least two separate raids from the east, as well as &quot;visits&quot; by Anawrahta and Kyansittha. According to the Arakanese accounts, the attacks from the east ousted kings Pe Byu and Nga Ton in succession. However, the dates are off by centuries with the ousted kings having reigned in the late 8th to early 9th centuries, 10th to 11th, or 11th to 12th centuries.

At any rate, as was the case with the Shan Hills, Anawrahta&#x27;s suzerainty over north Arakan (separated by the Arakan Yoma range) was nominal. The &quot;conquest&quot; may have been more of a raid to prevent Arakanese raids into Burma, and some historians (Lieberman, Charney) do not believe he (or any other Pagan kings) had any &quot;effective authority&quot; over Arakan. If Pagan never established an administrative system to govern Arakan, it continued to foster a vassal relationship for the remainder of Pagan dynasty, occasionally placing its nominees to the Arakanese throne. Moreover, the Burmese language and script came to dominate the Arakan littoral over the next centuries. With Burmese influence came ties to Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and the gradual prominence of Theravada Buddhism.

===Pateikkaya===
Anawrahta also received tribute from the Buddhist kingdom of Pateikkaya (, ). The location of the small kingdom remains in dispute. The Burmese chronicles report the location as northwest of Arakan and its kings Indian. But British historian GE Harvey reckoned that it was more likely nearer to the eastern Chin Hills. The Tripura State was described as &quot;Patikara&quot; in Maharajoang, an ancient historical book of Bramhadesh.

==External relations==
As his kingdom expanded, Anawrahta came into contact with the Dali Kingdom (the erstwhile home of the Burmans) in the northeast, and in the southeast, the Khmer Empire, the main power of mainland Southeast Asia at the time. He assisted fellow Theravada Buddhist Ceylon in its war against Hindu Chola invaders.

===Khmer Empire===
Pagan&#x27;s conquest of Thaton shook the Mon world. Anawrahta also demanded tribute from other neighboring Mon Kingdoms, Haripunjaya and Dvaravati (in present-day northern and central Thailand). Haripunjaya reportedly sent in tribute but Dvaravati&#x27;s overlord Khmer Empire instead invaded Tenasserim. Anawrahta sent his armies, again led by the four paladins, who repulsed the invaders. The Burmese chronicles referred to the Kingdom of Cambodia as the southeastern limit of the Pagan Empire.

===Dali Kingdom===
After the Khmer advance was checked, Anawrahta turned his attention toward Dali. Anawrahta led a campaign against the kingdom in the northeast. (According to a mid-17th century source, he began the march on 16 December 1057.) He advanced to Dali, the capital of Dali Kingdom, ostensibly to seek a Buddha&#x27;s tooth relic. As in the case of the request for the scriptures from Thaton, it was really a demand for tribute. The ruler of Dali shut the gates, and would not give up the relic. After a long pause, two kings exchanged presents and conversed amicably. The Dali ruler gave Anawrahta a jade image which had come into contact with the tooth.

===Ceylon===
In 1069, Vijayabahu I of Ceylon asked Anawrahta for aid against the Chola invaders from Tamil country. Anawrahta sent ships of supplies in aid of Buddhist Ceylon. In 1071, Vijayabahu who had defeated the Cholas asked Anawrahta for Buddhist scriptures and Buddhist monks. The Chola invasions had left the original home of Theravada Buddhism with so few monks that it was hard to convene a chapter and make valid ordinations. Anawrahta sent the monks and scriptures, and a white elephant as a present for Vijayabahu. The Burmese monks ordained or re-ordained the entire clergy of the island. In return, the Ceylonese king gave a replica of the Buddha Tooth of which Ceylon was the proud possessor. The replica was then enshrined in the Lawkananda Pagoda in Pagan.

==Administration==

===Nation-building===
The greatest achievement of Anawrahta was his consolidation of various ethnic groups into a single nation. He was careful that his own people, the Burmans, not flaunt themselves before other peoples. He continued to show regard for the Pyus, who had recently fallen from greatness. He retained the name Pyu for his kingdom although it was under the leadership of the Burmans. He showed regard for the Mons, and encouraged his people to learn from the Mons.

Anawrahta replaced the kings of Lower Burma (Pegu and Thaton) with governors. At Pegu, he allowed the king of Pegu to remain as a vassal king in appreciation of the latter&#x27;s help in Anawrahta&#x27;s conquest of Thaton. But after the vassal king&#x27;s death, he appointed a governor. Due to geographical distances, other tributary areas such as Arakan and Shan Hills were allowed to retain hereditary chieftainships.

===Religious reforms===

In 1056, a Mon Theravada Buddhist monk named Shin Arahan made a fateful visit to Pagan, and converted its king Anawrahta to Theravada Buddhism from his native Ari Buddhism. The king had been dissatisfied with the enormous power of Ari monks over the people, and considered the monks, who ate evening meals, drank liquor, presided over animal sacrifices, and enjoyed a form of &quot;ius primae noctis&quot;, depraved. In Theravada Buddhism he found a substitute to break the power of the clergy.

From 1056 onwards, Anawrahta implemented a series of religious reforms throughout his kingdom. His reforms gained steam after his conquest of Thaton, which brought much needed scriptures and clergy from the vanquished kingdom. He broke the power of the Ari monks first by declaring that his court would no longer heed if people ceased to yield their children to the priests. Those who were in bondage of the priests gained freedom. Some of the monks simply disrobed or followed the new way. However, the majority of the monks who had wielded power for so long would not go away easily.

Anawrahta banished them in numbers; many of them fled to Popa Hill and the Shan Hills. He used traditional nat spirits to attract people to his new religion. Asked why he allowed the nats to be placed in Buddhist temples and pagodas, Anawrahta answered &quot;Men will not come for the sake of new faith. Let them come for their old gods, and gradually they will be won over.&quot;

Urged on by Shin Arahan, Anawrahta tried to reform the very Theravada Buddhism he received from Thaton, which by most accounts, was in a state of decay, and increasingly influenced by Hinduism. &quot;(The Mon chronicles hint that Manuha was reprehensible for making a compromise with Hinduism. Shin Arahan left Thaton because he was unhappy with the decaying of Buddhism there.)&quot; He made Pagan a center of Theravada learning by inviting scholars from the Mon lands, Ceylon as well as from India where a dying Buddhism was being given a &quot;coup de grace&quot; by Hindu Forces. The scholarship helped revitalize a more orthodox form of Theravada Buddhism.

To be sure, his reforms could not and did not achieve everything overnight. The spread of Theravada Buddhism in Upper Burma was gradual; it took over three centuries. Its monastic system did not achieve widespread village level penetration in more remote areas until as late as the 19th century. Nor did the Aris die out. Their descendants, known as forest dwelling monks, remained a powerful force patronized by the royalty down to the Ava period in the 16th century. Likewise, the nat worship continued (down to the present day). Even the Theravada Buddhism of Anawrahta, Kyansittha and Manuha was one still strongly influenced by Hinduism when compared to later more orthodox (18th and 19th century) standards. Tantric, Saivite, and Vaishnava elements enjoyed greater elite influence than they would later do, reflecting both the relative immaturity of early Burmese literacy culture and its indiscriminate receptivity to non-Burman traditions. Indeed, even today&#x27;s Burmese Buddhism contains many animist, Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu elements.

He was the first of the &quot;Temple Builders&quot; of Pagan. His chief monument was the Shwezigon Pagoda. The work began in 1059 but was still unfinished at his death 18 years later. He also built the Shwesandaw Pagoda south of Pagan to house the hair relics presented by Pegu. Farther afield, he built other pagodas such as Shweyinhmyaw, Shwegu and Shwezigon near Meiktila.

===Invention of Burmese alphabet===
Scholarship believed until recently that Anawrahta commissioned the invention of the Burmese alphabet based on the Mon script, c. 1058, a year after the Thaton conquest. However, recent research finds that the Burmese alphabet had been in use at least since 1035, and if an 18th-century recast inscription is permissible as evidence, since 984 CE.

===Governing style===
Anawrahta was an energetic king who implemented many profound enduring political, socioeconomic and cultural changes. He was admired and feared but not loved by his subjects.

Historian Htin Aung writes:
(The queen in love with Kyansittha was Manisanda Khin U. The two young heroes executed were Shwe Hpyin Gyi and Shwe Hpyin Nge, who later entered the pantheon of Burmese nat spirits).

But people admired and feared him, and he was able to implement many of his ambitious multifaceted reforms.

==Death==
Anawrahta died on 11 April 1077 in the outskirts of Pagan. The chronicles hint that his enemies ambushed and killed him and then disposed of the body in such a way that it was never found. The chronicles state that a nat (spirit) appeared in the guise of wild buffalo and gored him to death, and then demons took away his body.

==Legacy==

Anawrahta is considered one of the greatest, if not the greatest, king of Burmese history for he founded first &quot;charter polity&quot; of what would later become modern Burma. Not only did he greatly expand the Pagan Kingdom but he also implemented a series of political and administrative reforms that enabled his empire to dominate the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery for another 250 years.

Anawrahta&#x27;s legacy went far beyond the borders of modern Burma. The success and longevity of Pagan&#x27;s dominance over the Irrawaddy valley laid the foundation for the ascent of Burmese language and culture, the spread of Burman ethnicity in Upper Burma. His embrace of Theravada Buddhism and his success in stopping the advance of Khmer Empire, a Hindu kingdom, provided the Buddhist school, which had been in retreat elsewhere in South and Southeast Asia, a much-needed reprieve and a safe shelter. He helped restart Theravada Buddhism in Ceylon, the Buddhist school&#x27;s original home. The success of Pagan dynasty made Theravada Buddhism&#x27;s later growth in Lan Na, Siam, Lan Xang, and Cambodia, also due in a large part to Ceylon&#x27;s interactions with those lands, in the 13th and 14th centuries possible.

==In popular culture==

Anawrahta&#x27;s life stories and legends remain a popular subject of Burmese folklore. The love triangle involving Anawrahta, Kyansittha and Manisanda as well as the sad story of Saw Mon Hla, one of his queens, are a staple of Burmese theater. Due to his reputation as a stern father figure, he is not the central character in these stories where the main protagonist invariably is the romantic soldier-king Kyansittha.

<text>The 7th Armoured Division was an armoured division of the British Army. It was formed as the Mobile Division (Egypt) on 27 September 1938, after increased tensions between Britain and the Axis powers. This was part of an effort to reinforce and maintain the British strategic presence in Egypt to defend the Suez Canal, which was seen as vital to the British Empire&#x27;s interests. In February 1940, the formation was renamed as the 7th Armoured Division. During its early years, the jerboa was adopted as the mascot and divisional insignia giving rise to the nickname Desert Rats.

The division fought in most of the major battles of the Western Desert campaign, was then engaged in the Tunisian campaign, and this was followed by the participation in the Italian campaign. It was then withdrawn from Italy and dispatched to the United Kingdom, to prepare for Operation Overlord. In June 1944, it landed in France and subsequently fought across western Europe and ended the war in Kiel and Hamburg, Germany.

After the war it formed part of the British Army of the Rhine until it was disbanded in the 1950s. The division&#x27;s history and insignia was carried on by the 7th Armoured Brigade, until the brigade was disbanded in 2014, and is now maintained by the 7th Light Mechanised Brigade Combat Team.

==Background==

The Suez Canal, located in Egypt, was seen as a vital throughway of the British Empire linking Britain with its colonial possessions in the east, especially British India. In addition, it held economic and prestigious importance. To maintain this, Egypt was occupied in 1882 and a protectorate was subsequently established. During the First World War, the Ottoman Empire came into conflict with the Entente, and the British presence in Egypt was reinforced. Following the conclusion of hostilities and the British victory in the Middle Eastern theatre, Britain intended to maintain a garrison to protect the canal. However, military commitments had to be balanced with economic and geopolitical conditions. From a peak of 400,000 men in 1919, the garrison was reduced to 20,000 by 1921 and included the Cairo Cavalry Brigade.

During the inter-war period, the Middle East and the canal gained further importance as oil production expanded, in addition to the development of aerial links between Britain and British India. In 1935, British policy shifted to view Italy as the principal threat towards British interests in the Middle East, following the Italian military build-up and invasion of Ethiopia. This crisis prompted the deployment an ad hoc formation called the Mobile Force, based around the Cairo Cavalry Brigade, to Mersa Matruh in the Western Desert, west of Alexandria. Due to rain and sandstorms, vehicles became stuck or were stricken by mechanical issues resulting in the moniker &quot;Mobile Farce&quot; being applied. The crisis also saw the UK and Egypt negotiate the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936, which stated that the majority of the British military were to be confined to the canal zone except in emergencies. In the case of the latter, troops could be deployed across Egypt. This saw the increased importance of Mersa Matruh, as it became the location from which the defense of Egypt would be conducted if Italy attacked. A joint declaration on 2 January 1937, by Italy and Britain, to maintain the status quo around the Mediterranean, momentarily eased the situation between both countries. However, tensions quickly mounted and in early 1938 the garrison in Egypt was authorised to be brought up from its peace time to its wartime establishment. It was envisioned that behind the Mersa Matruh position, a force of one mobile and two infantry divisions could be assembled in the event of war. During the same year, the political situation in Europe escalated as Germany annexed Austria and then focused its attention on the German-dominated territory within Czechoslovakia. As Italy was closely aligned with Germany, British forces moved to Mersa Matruh and authorization was provided to form a mobile division in Egypt.

==Formation==

In September 1938, due to the tensions between Britain and the Axis Powers and a concern that Italy could invade Egypt, the Cairo Cavalry Brigade was ordered to Mersa Matruh. The brigade consisted of the 7th Hussars equipped with light tanks, the 8th Hussars outfitted with trucks with the intent to be motorised cavalry, and the 11th Hussars with armoured cars. Once there, the brigade was reinforced by the 1st Battalion, Royal Tank Corps, as well as artillery, engineers, medical, and logistical units and became known as the Mobile Force. The assortment of different models of light tanks that the force had, lacked spare parts and the tank tracks had reached the end of their potential mileage capacity. For example, the 1st Battalion, Royal Tank Corps, had 63 light tanks but were quickly reduced to nine serviceable models. However, the historian Kenneth Macksey, a member of the Royal Armoured Corps during the Second World War, contended that it &quot;might well have prevailed had the Italians&quot; invaded Egypt, due to the armoured cars being in good working order and the Italian opposition consisting largely of tankettes. When tensions subsided, due to the Munich Agreement on 30 September, the force moved to Cairo where it was joined by is first infantry unit, the 1st Battalion, King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps (1st KRRC).

In the meantime, on 27 September, Major-General Percy Hobart was reassigned from being the Director of Military Training and ordered to Egypt to form an armoured formation. He joined the Mobile Force after its arrival in Cairo in October, and it was used as the nucleus of the new division. Theoretical and organisational work took place over the following months, before the first desert exercises were conducted in March 1939. Field training was limited by vehicle shortages and tanks restricted on how many miles they could traverse due to the same issues that the Mobile Force had encountered six months prior. With desert training concluded, the formation returned to Cairo where indoor exercises were held over the summer, while the higher ranks examined and refined the division&#x27;s administration and logistical issues and explored desert warfare principles.

During 1939, the Mobile Division (Egypt) was renamed as the Armoured Division (Egypt), while the Cairo Cavalry Brigade became the Light Armoured Brigade (Egypt). The 7th Hussars were re-equipped with the Light Tank Mk VI, and handed over their old tanks to the 8th Hussars. Additional armoured cars were delivered to the 11th Hussars, while the divisional artillery was provided with modern 25-pounder gun-howitzers. The 1st Battalion (Mk VI light tanks) and the 6th Battalion (light tanks and obsolete Vickers Medium Mark II), Royal Tank Corps, were assigned to the division&#x27;s newly formed Heavy Armoured Brigade (Egypt) (later the 4th Armoured Brigade), and started to receive modern Cruiser Mk I tanks in October 1939 to replace the medium tanks.

When tensions in Europe reached a boiling point, in late August and just prior to the outbreak of the Second World War in September, the division was again deployed into the Western Desert. In December, with Italy having not joined the war, the formation returned to Cairo to resume training. The training conducted over the course of the year earned Hobart, and the division, the praise of his immediate superior, Major-General Richard O&#x27;Connor (commander, Western Desert Force), who stated it was the best trained formation he had ever seen. Similar plaudits came from Lieutenant-General Henry Maitland Wilson (Commander-in-Chief British Troops in Egypt), O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s superior. An exercise in October, however, resulted in a public reprimand for Hobart due to errors made. In November, Hobart was dismissed by General Archibald Wavell (Commander-in-Chief Middle East Command and who oversaw Wilson) and ordered back to the UK. Hobart&#x27;s biography suggested that the dismissal was the result of long held animosities between Hobart and the upper echelons of the British Army; and noted that while Wavell may not have held direct issues with Hobart, he would have been motivated to ensure that there was good working relationship between the various commanders that he oversaw.

Major-General Michael O&#x27;Moore Creagh, the Inspector of the Royal Armoured Corps, was given command of the division on 4 December 1939 as Hobart&#x27;s replacement. Two months later, on 16 February 1940, further nomenclature changes took place. The formation was renamed as the 7th Armoured Division, the Heavy Armoured Brigade (Egypt) became the 4th Heavy Armoured Brigade, and the Light Armoured Brigade (Egypt) was redesignated as the 7th Light Armoured Brigade. The two armoured brigades dropped the heavy and light descriptives on 14 April. During April 1940, the War Office set out an organisation for armoured divisions that stated such formations should have 340 tanks. During this period, the 7th Armoured Division had just 65 cruiser tanks, with eight not equipped with their required anti-tank weapons. The same month, the division started to return to Mersa Matruh. Training continued for the majority, while the 11th Hussars moved close to the Frontier Wire on the Egypt-Libyan border, where they started reconnaissance of Italian positions.

===Insignia===
The initial divisional insignia was similar to that used by the 7th Division during the First World War: A white circle, but on a red background rather than the First World War-era black background. In early 1940, the Jerboa (also known as a desert rat) was added to the design. While primarily red, the Imperial War Museum highlighted that pink variations may have existed. The design was used on vehicles from its inception, but there is no evidence that it was worn on uniforms until at least 1943. Then, only a single photograph depicts such and it is of the commanding officer. It is believed that the insignia was worn commonly on uniforms starting in 1944, and after the division arrived in the UK.

Most sources concur that the jerboa design was created during Creagh&#x27;s tenure; that he felt something representative was needed to be added to the white circle and chose the desert rat. His wife then went to the Cairo zoo and sketched the first draft. Rea Leakey, who was the division&#x27;s intelligence officer (GSO 3) at the time, claimed in his memoir that he and Hobart conversed about his pet jerboa. When he informed Hobart that they were called desert rats, Hobart decided to use that as the nickname for the division. George Forty, who edited the memoir, included a contradictory note that disputed Leakey&#x27;s version of events and explained the story surrounding Creagh and his wife at the zoo.

==Second World War==
===North Africa===

On 10 June 1940, Italy entered the Second World War against the Allies. In response, the 1st KRRC, the 7th, and the 11th Hussars patrolled the border and then crossed into Italian territory the next day and took 70 prisoners. The Italian border forts Capuzzo and Maddalena were quickly taken, and various small unit actions inflicted the loss of 24 armoured cars and several hundred casualties on the Italians. The first tank-on-tank clash for the division occurred on 16 June, when a force of 12 Italian light tanks were engaged and destroyed. However, these actions did not hinder the Italian build-up, and they soon retook Capuzzo and engaged in their own reconnaissance efforts. While more of the division&#x27;s tank units were initially moved forward, it was decided to avoid mechanical attrition and the majority were pulled back to the Mersa Matruh area. This left one tank regiment along with the 1st KRRC, joined by two additional infantry battalions, and several batteries from the division&#x27;s artillery to monitor a section of the border. Their instructions were to harass any Italian probes and to attempt to delay, but not become seriously engaged with, any offensive move. The 11th Hussars were allowed to continue their long-range efforts into Italian territory. Between 11 June and 9 September, 3,500 Italian casualties were inflicted for the loss of 150 of the division&#x27;s personnel. The tank strength of the division had also rose to 85 cruisers by September, although 15 were being repaired and wear and tear issues impacted the rest.

On 13 September, the Italians invaded Egypt with a force of five divisions supplemented by a tank group. In accordance with their instructions, the division&#x27;s forward elements engaged and harassed the Italians while falling back to avoid prolonged engagements. By 16 September, the Italians had reached Sidi Barrani. They halted to improve the infrastructure behind them and constructed a series of fortified camps. The 7th Armoured Division regrouped at Mersa Matruh, then spent the following two months reconnoitering the Italian positions. Towards the end of August, and prior to the Italian invasion, reinforcements and supplies were dispatched to Egypt from the UK. This included artillery, spare parts, and around 100 tanks for the division; a mix of light tanks and cruisers split between two armoured regiments. Their arrival in early October doubled the 7th Armoured Division&#x27;s strength.

On 9 December, the Western Desert Force launched its counterattack. The division protected the flank of the initial attack, then provided more direct support over the following days and assisted in the capture of a large number of Italian troops. They then pursued the Italians into Libya and took up position between Tobruk and Bardia. In January, as Bardia was captured, the division advanced on then encircled Tobruk. In February, with Italian forces in retreat across Libya, the division crossed the desert south of the Jebel Akhdar and captured Beda Fomm, south of Benghazi. On 7 February, as the tanks were unable to travel fast enough, the manoeuvre was led by an &quot;ad hoc&quot; brigade of armoured cars, towed artillery and infantry, which completed the trip in 30 hours, that cut off the Italian retreat and destroyed the Italian Tenth Army. Lieutenant Colonel John Combe led this &quot;ad hoc&quot; group, which was known as &quot;Combe Force&quot; after him. After this, the tanks of the 7th Armoured Division, after eight months of fighting, needed a complete overhaul and the division was withdrawn to Cairo and temporarily ceased to be available as a fighting formation being replaced in the line by the 2nd Armoured Division. Compass ultimately captured 130,000 Italians.

The Italians had proven so weak that Hitler was forced to send the Afrika Korps, under Erwin Rommel, as reinforcements. In April 1941, the Allied troops in Tobruk were cut off by the Germans and Italians.

On 7 June, the division was again prepared for battle as part of Operation Battleaxe, having received new tanks and additional personnel. In the attack plan for Battleaxe, the 7th force was divided between the Coast Force and Escarpment Force. However, this Allied push failed, and the 7th Armoured Division was forced to withdraw on the third day of fighting. On 18 November, as part of Operation Crusader the whole of the 7th Armoured Division was concentrated on breaking through. They faced only the weakened 21st Panzer Division. However, the XXX Corps commander, Lieutenant-General Willoughby Norrie, aware that the 7th Armoured Division was down to 200 tanks, decided on caution. During the wait, in the early afternoon of 22 November, Rommel attacked Sidi Rezegh with the 21st Panzer and captured the airfield. Fighting was desperate and gallant: for his actions during these two days of fighting, Brigadier Jock Campbell, commanding the 7th Support Group, was awarded the Victoria Cross. However, the 21st Panzer, despite being considerably weaker in armour, proved superior in its combined arms tactics, pushing the 7th Armoured back with a further 50 tanks lost (mainly from the 22nd Armoured Brigade).

On 27 June 1942, elements of the 7th Armoured Division, along with units of the 3rd The King&#x27;s Own Hussars, suffered one of the worst friendly fire incidents when they were attacked by a group of Royal Air Force (RAF) Vickers Wellington medium bombers during a two-hour raid near Mersa Matruh, Egypt. Over 359 troops were killed and 560 others were wounded.

The Western Desert Force later became HQ XIII Corps, one of the major parts of the British Eighth Army which, from August 1942 was commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Bernard Montgomery. The 7th Armoured Division took part in most of the major battles of the North African Campaign, including both battles of El Alamein (the First Battle of El Alamein in July 1942, which stopped the Axis advance, and the Second Battle of El Alamein in October/November 1942, which turned the tide of the war in North Africa).

The 7th Armoured Division, now consisting of the 22nd Armoured and 131st Infantry Brigades and commanded by Major General John Harding, fought in many major battles of the Tunisian Campaign, taking part in the Battle of El Agheila in December. By January 1943 the Eighth Army had reached Tripoli where a victory parade was held, with the 7th Armoured Division taking part. Among the witnesses was Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, and General Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS).

The division, now commanded by Major General George Erskine after Harding was severely injured in January, next took part in the Battle of Medenine, followed by the Battle of the Mareth Line in March. In late April, towards the end of the campaign, the 7th Armoured Division was transferred to IX Corps of the British First Army for the assault on Medjez El Bab. The attack was successful, with the 7th Armoured Division competing with the 6th Armoured Division of the First Army in a race to the city of Tunis, with &#x27;B&#x27; Squadron of the 11th Hussars being first into the city on the afternoon of 7 May, followed closely by the 22nd Armoured Brigade and the 131st Brigade. The fighting in North Africa came to an end just days later, with almost 250,000 Axis soldiers surrendering to the Allies and becoming POWs.

===Italy===
The division was not an assault force in the invasion of Sicily, instead remaining in Homs, Syria for training in amphibious warfare, but did participate in the early stages of the Italian campaign.

The 7th Armoured Division came ashore at Salerno, on 15 September 1943, to help repel heavy German counterattacks during the Battle for the Salerno beachhead (Operation Avalanche). Shortly after landing on the 18th the 131st (Queen&#x27;s) Infantry Brigade (which consisted of the 1/5th, 1/6th and 1/7th Territorial battalions of the Queen&#x27;s Royal Regiment) relieved its &#x27;sister&#x27; duplicate, the 169th (Queen&#x27;s) Infantry Brigade, (consisting of 2/5th, 2/6th and 2/7th Queen&#x27;s, all formed in 1939), which was part of the 56th (London) Infantry Division, and had been in continuous combat since 9 September. The assembly of six battalions of a single regiment has since been considered a unique moment in the regiment&#x27;s history. The 169th Brigade was commanded at the time by Brigadier Lewis Lyne, who would later command the 7th Armoured Division from November 1944 onwards.

Then, it drove on and took Naples. Used to fighting in the desert, the division had to adjust to the confined Italian roads.

The division crossed the river Volturno in southern Italy, constructing a pontoon bridge.
On the wishes of the British Eighth Army commander, General Montgomery, the 7th Armoured Division was recalled to the United Kingdom, along with the 4th and 8th Armoured Brigades, and the 50th (Northumbrian) and 51st (Highland) Infantry Divisions, all of which had seen extensive service alongside the 7th Armoured Division in the Mediterranean and Middle East, to participate in the invasion of North Western Europe with the British Second Army. The 7th Armoured, handing over its battered vehicles and equipment to the recently arrived 5th Canadian (Armoured) Division, left Italy in late December 1943, arriving in Glasgow, Scotland in early January 1944.

===North West Europe===

In November 1943, the division left Italy for the United Kingdom, with the last units arriving on 7 January 1944. The division was re-equipped with the new Cromwell cruiser tanks and in April and May received 36 Sherman Vc Fireflies. Each troop now had three 75 mm gun Cromwells and a 17-pounder gun Firefly. The Desert Rats were the only British armoured division to use the Cromwell as their main battle tank.

The 22nd Armoured Brigade embarked on 4 June, and most of the division landed on Gold Beach by the end of 7 June, a day after the initial landings. 7th Armoured initially took part in Operation Perch and Operation Goodwood, two operations that formed part of the Battle for Caen. During Perch, the division was to spearhead one arm of a pincer attack to capture the city. Due to a change in plan, elements of the division engaged tanks of the Panzer-Lehr-Division and the Heavy SS-Panzer Battalion 101 in the Battle of Villers-Bocage and were repulsed. Following the capture of Caen, the division took part in Operation Spring, which was intended to keep the German forces pinned to the British front away from the Americans who were launching Operation Cobra, and then Operation Bluecoat, an attack to support the American break-out and intercept German reinforcements moving to stop it. After the Battle of the Falaise Gap, which saw most of the German Army in Normandy destroyed, the 7th Armoured Division then took part in the Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine.

The division&#x27;s performance in Normandy and the rest of France has been called into question and it has been claimed they did not match those of its earlier campaigns. In early August 1944, Major General George Erskine, who had commanded the division since January 1943, Brigadier William Hinde, commanding the 22nd Armoured Brigade, and up to 100 other officers of the division were removed from their positions and reassigned. Erskine was replaced as GOC by Major General Gerald Lloyd-Verney. Historians largely agree that this was a consequence of the &quot;failure&quot; at Villers-Bocage and had been planned since that battle. Historian Daniel Taylor is of the opinion that the battle&#x27;s result provided an excuse and that the sackings took place to &quot;demonstrate that the army command was doing something to counteract the poor public opinion of the conduct of the campaign&quot;. Historian and former British Army officer Mungo Melvin has commented approvingly of the 7th Armoured Division&#x27;s institution of a flexible combined arms structure, which other British armoured divisions did not adopt until after Operation Goodwood.

The replacement of Erskine in August did not change the performance of the division. In November 1944, Lloyd-Verney was relieved by Major General Lyne, after he &quot;was unable to cure the division&#x27;s bad habits well enough to satisfy Montgomery and Dempsey&quot;. There is almost no doubt that the division was suffering from collective and cumulative battle fatigue. As Lloyd-Verney put it, with some prescience: &quot;There is no doubt that familiarity with war does not make one more courageous. One becomes cunning and from cunning to cowardice is but a short step.&quot; This was not an isolated incident: the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division and several other veteran formations Montgomery had brought back from the Mediterranean experienced similar difficulties, although not the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, which performed well throughout the Normandy Campaign.

Following the advance across France, the division took part in the Allied advance through Belgium and the Netherlands, liberating Ghent on 6 September. The division then took part in the advance to and securing of the River Maas, where the division, now commanded by Major-General Lewis Lyne, a highly experienced commander, was slightly reorganized, with many experienced men who had been overseas with the division for five years returning home. In January 1945 the division, with the 8th Armoured Brigade and 155th Infantry Brigade (from the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division) under command, took part in Operation Blackcock to clear the Roer Triangle. The division had a short rest for training in late February. This was followed by Operation Plunder: the 7th Armoured Division crossed the River Rhine near Xanten and Wesel and advanced northeast. On 16 April 1945, the 7th Armoured Division liberated Stalag 11B in Fallingbostel, which was the first prisoner-of-war camp to be liberated. The 7th Armoured Division&#x27;s last action of the war was the battle for the German city of Hamburg.

In July 1945 the 7th Armoured Division took part in the 1945 British victory parade in Berlin. Among the many witnesses of the parade were British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who was particularly fond of the division, Field Marshal Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and Field Marshal Montgomery.

== Post war ==
During the summer of 1945, the BAOR reorganised and disbanded its corps headquarters. These were replaced by new formations based around a divisional headquarters. This resulted in the creation of the 7th Armoured Division District, which was headquartered at Bad Rothenfelde. The division was reformed when Hannover District became the 7th Armoured Division. The division remained part of the BAOR until April 1958, when it was redesignated as the 5th Division. While the division ceased to exist, its traditions and iconic nickname were maintained by 7th Armoured Brigade.

A monument to commemorate the 7th Armoured was erected at Brandon in Thetford Forest where the division trained prior to D-day.

<text>In mathematics, a real number is said to be simply normal in an integer base b if its infinite sequence of digits is distributed uniformly in the sense that each of the b digit values has the same natural density 1/b. A number is said to be normal in base b if, for every positive integer n, all possible strings n digits long have density b−&quot;n&quot;.

Intuitively, a number being simply normal means that no digit occurs more frequently than any other. If a number is normal, no finite combination of digits of a given length occurs more frequently than any other combination of the same length. A normal number can be thought of as an infinite sequence of coin flips (binary) or rolls of a die (base 6). Even though there &quot;will&quot; be sequences such as 10, 100, or more consecutive tails (binary) or fives (base 6) or even 10, 100, or more repetitions of a sequence such as tail-head (two consecutive coin flips) or 6-1 (two consecutive rolls of a die), there will also be equally many of any other sequence of equal length. No digit or sequence is &quot;favored&quot;. 

A number is said to be normal (sometimes called absolutely normal) if it is normal in all integer bases greater than or equal to 2.

While a general proof can be given that almost all real numbers are normal (meaning that the set of non-normal numbers has Lebesgue measure zero), this proof is not constructive, and only a few specific numbers have been shown to be normal. For example, any Chaitin&#x27;s constant is normal (and uncomputable). It is widely believed that the (computable) numbers , , and &quot;e&quot; are normal, but a proof remains elusive.

== Definitions ==

Let be a finite alphabet of -digits, the set of all infinite sequences that may be drawn from that alphabet, and the set of finite sequences, or strings. Let be such a sequence. For each in let denote the number of times the digit appears in the first digits of the sequence . We say that is simply normal if the limit

formula_1

for each . Now let be any finite string in and let be the number of times the string appears as a substring in the first digits of the sequence . (For instance, if , then .) is normal if, for all finite strings ,

formula_2

where denotes the length of the string . In other words, is normal if all strings of equal length occur with equal asymptotic frequency. For example, in a normal binary sequence (a sequence over the alphabet ), and each occur with frequency ; , , , and each occur with frequency ; , , , , , , , and each occur with frequency ; etc. Roughly speaking, the probability of finding the string in any given position in is precisely that expected if the sequence had been produced at random.

Suppose now that is an integer greater than 1 and is a real number. Consider the infinite digit sequence expansion of in the base positional number system (we ignore the decimal point). We say that is simply normal in base if the sequence is simply normal and that is normal in base if the sequence is normal. The number is called a normal number (or sometimes an absolutely normal number) if it is normal in base for every integer greater than 1.

A given infinite sequence is either normal or not normal, whereas a real number, having a different base- expansion for each integer , may be normal in one base but not in another (in which case it is not a normal number). For bases and with rational (so that and ) every number normal in base is normal in base . For bases and with irrational, there are uncountably many numbers normal in each base but not the other.

A disjunctive sequence is a sequence in which every finite string appears. A normal sequence is disjunctive, but a disjunctive sequence need not be normal. A &quot;rich number&quot; in base is one whose expansion in base is disjunctive: one that is disjunctive to every base is called &quot;absolutely disjunctive&quot; or is said to be a &quot;lexicon&quot;. A number normal in base is rich in base , but not necessarily conversely. The real number is rich in base if and only if the set is dense in the unit interval.

We defined a number to be simply normal in base if each individual digit appears with frequency . For a given base , a number can be simply normal (but not normal or rich), rich (but not simply normal or normal), normal (and thus simply normal and rich), or none of these. A number is absolutely non-normal or absolutely abnormal if it is not simply normal in any base.

== Properties and examples ==
The concept of a normal number was introduced by . Using the Borel–Cantelli lemma, he proved that almost all real numbers are normal, establishing the existence of normal numbers. showed that it is possible to specify a particular such number. proved that there is a computable absolutely normal number.
Although this construction does not directly give the digits of the numbers constructed, it shows that it is possible in principle to enumerate each digit of a particular normal number.

The set of non-normal numbers, despite being &quot;large&quot; in the sense of being uncountable, is also a null set (as its Lebesgue measure as a subset of the real numbers is zero, so it essentially takes up no space within the real numbers). Also, the non-normal numbers (as well as the normal numbers) are dense in the reals: the set of non-normal numbers between two distinct real numbers is non-empty since it contains every rational number (in fact, it is uncountably infinite and even comeagre). For instance, there are uncountably many numbers whose decimal expansions (in base 3 or higher) do not contain the digit 1, and none of those numbers are normal.

Champernowne&#x27;s constant

obtained by concatenating the decimal representations of the natural numbers in order, is normal in base 10. Likewise, the different variants of Champernowne&#x27;s constant (done by performing the same concatenation in other bases) are normal in their respective bases (for example, the base-2 Champernowne constant is normal in base 2), but they have not been proven to be normal in other bases.

The Copeland–Erdős constant

obtained by concatenating the prime numbers in base 10, is normal in base 10, as proved by . More generally, the latter authors proved that the real number represented in base &quot;b&quot; by the concatenation 

where &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the &quot;n&quot;th prime expressed in base &quot;b&quot;, is normal in base &quot;b&quot;. proved that the number represented by the same expression, with &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;n&quot;2,

obtained by concatenating the square numbers in base 10, is normal in base 10. proved that the number represented by the same expression, with &quot;f&quot; being any non-constant polynomial whose values on the positive integers are positive integers, expressed in base 10, is normal in base 10.

 proved that if &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is any non-constant polynomial with real coefficients such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) &gt; 0 for all &quot;x&quot; &gt; 0, then the real number represented by the concatenation 

where [&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)] is the integer part of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) expressed in base &quot;b&quot;, is normal in base &quot;b&quot;. (This result includes as special cases all of the above-mentioned results of Champernowne, Besicovitch, and Davenport &amp; Erdős.) The authors also show that the same result holds even more generally when &quot;f&quot; is any function of the form

where the αs and βs are real numbers with β &gt; β1 &gt; β2 &gt; ... &gt; β&quot;d&quot; ≥ 0, and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) &gt; 0 for all &quot;x&quot; &gt; 0.

 show an explicit uncountably infinite class of &quot;b&quot;-normal numbers by perturbing Stoneham numbers.

It has been an elusive goal to prove the normality of numbers that are not artificially constructed. While , π, ln(2), and e are strongly conjectured to be normal, it is still not known whether they are normal or not. It has not even been proven that all digits actually occur infinitely many times in the decimal expansions of those constants (for example, in the case of π, the popular claim &quot;every string of numbers eventually occurs in π&quot; is not known to be true). It has also been conjectured that every irrational algebraic number is absolutely normal (which would imply that is normal), and no counterexamples are known in any base. However, no irrational algebraic number has been proven to be normal in any base.

===Non-normal numbers===
No rational number is normal in any base, since the digit sequences of rational numbers are eventually periodic.

 gives an example of an irrational number that is absolutely abnormal. Let

formula_3

formula_4

Then α is a Liouville number and is absolutely abnormal.

===Properties===
Additional properties of normal numbers include:

* Every non-zero real number is the product of two normal numbers. This follows from the general fact that every number is the product of two numbers from a set formula_5 if the complement of &quot;X&quot; has measure 0.
* If &quot;x&quot; is normal in base &quot;b&quot; and &quot;a&quot; ≠ 0 is a rational number, then formula_6 is also normal in base &quot;b&quot;.
* If formula_7 is &quot;dense&quot; (for every formula_8 and for all sufficiently large &quot;n&quot;, formula_9) and formula_10 are the base-&quot;b&quot; expansions of the elements of &quot;A&quot;, then the number formula_11, formed by concatenating the elements of &quot;A&quot;, is normal in base &quot;b&quot; (Copeland and Erdős 1946). From this it follows that Champernowne&#x27;s number is normal in base 10 (since the set of all positive integers is obviously dense) and that the Copeland–Erdős constant is normal in base 10 (since the prime number theorem implies that the set of primes is dense).
* A sequence is normal if and only if every &quot;block&quot; of equal length appears with equal frequency. (A block of length &quot;k&quot; is a substring of length &quot;k&quot; appearing at a position in the sequence that is a multiple of &quot;k&quot;: e.g. the first length-&quot;k&quot; block in &quot;S&quot; is &quot;S&quot;[1..&quot;k&quot;], the second length-&quot;k&quot; block is &quot;S&quot;[&quot;k&quot;+1..2&quot;k&quot;], etc.) This was implicit in the work of and made explicit in the work of .
* A number is normal in base &quot;b&quot; if and only if it is simply normal in base &quot;bk&quot; for all formula_12. This follows from the previous block characterization of normality: Since the &quot;n&quot;th block of length &quot;k&quot; in its base &quot;b&quot; expansion corresponds to the &quot;n&quot;th digit in its base &quot;bk&quot; expansion, a number is simply normal in base &quot;bk&quot; if and only if blocks of length &quot;k&quot; appear in its base &quot;b&quot; expansion with equal frequency.
* A number is normal if and only if it is simply normal in every base. This follows from the previous characterization of base &quot;b&quot; normality.
* A number is &quot;b&quot;-normal if and only if there exists a set of positive integers formula_13 where the number is simply normal in bases &quot;b&quot;&quot;m&quot; for all formula_14 No finite set suffices to show that the number is &quot;b&quot;-normal.
* All normal sequences are closed under finite variations: adding, removing, or changing a finite number of digits in any normal sequence leaves it normal. Similarly, if a finite number of digits are added to, removed from, or changed in any simply normal sequence, the new sequence is still simply normal.

== Connection to finite-state machines ==
Agafonov showed an early connection between finite-state machines and normal sequences: every infinite subsequence selected from a normal sequence by a regular language is also normal. In other words, if one runs a finite-state machine on a normal sequence, where each of the finite-state machine&#x27;s states are labeled either &quot;output&quot; or &quot;no output&quot;, and the machine outputs the digit it reads next after entering an &quot;output&quot; state, but does not output the next digit after entering a &quot;no output state&quot;, then the sequence it outputs will be normal.

A deeper connection exists with finite-state gamblers (FSGs) and information lossless finite-state compressors (ILFSCs).

* A finite-state gambler (a.k.a. finite-state martingale) is a finite-state machine over a finite alphabet formula_15, each of whose states is labelled with percentages of money to bet on each digit in formula_15. For instance, for an FSG over the binary alphabet formula_17, the current state &quot;q&quot; bets some percentage formula_18 of the gambler&#x27;s money on the bit 0, and the remaining formula_19 fraction of the gambler&#x27;s money on the bit 1. The money bet on the digit that comes next in the input (total money times percent bet) is multiplied by formula_20, and the rest of the money is lost. After the bit is read, the FSG transitions to the next state according to the input it received. A FSG &quot;d&quot; succeeds on an infinite sequence &quot;S&quot; if, starting from $1, it makes unbounded money betting on the sequence; i.e., ifformula_21where formula_22 is the amount of money the gambler &quot;d&quot; has after reading the first &quot;n&quot; digits of &quot;S&quot; (see limit superior).
* A finite-state compressor is a finite-state machine with output strings labelling its state transitions, including possibly the empty string. (Since one digit is read from the input sequence for each state transition, it is necessary to be able to output the empty string in order to achieve any compression at all). An information lossless finite-state compressor is a finite-state compressor whose input can be uniquely recovered from its output and final state. In other words, for a finite-state compressor &quot;C&quot; with state set &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;C&quot; is information lossless if the function formula_23, mapping the input string of &quot;C&quot; to the output string and final state of &quot;C&quot;, is 1–1. Compression techniques such as Huffman coding or Shannon–Fano coding can be implemented with ILFSCs. An ILFSC &quot;C&quot; compresses an infinite sequence &quot;S&quot; ifformula_24where formula_25 is the number of digits output by &quot;C&quot; after reading the first &quot;n&quot; digits of &quot;S&quot;. The compression ratio (the limit inferior above) can always be made to equal 1 by the 1-state ILFSC that simply copies its input to the output.

Schnorr and Stimm showed that no FSG can succeed on any normal sequence, and Bourke, Hitchcock and Vinodchandran showed the converse. Therefore:

Ziv and Lempel showed:

(they actually showed that the sequence&#x27;s optimal compression ratio over all ILFSCs is exactly its &quot;entropy rate&quot;, a quantitative measure of its deviation from normality, which is 1 exactly when the sequence is normal). Since the LZ compression algorithm compresses asymptotically as well as any ILFSC, this means that the LZ compression algorithm can compress any non-normal sequence.

These characterizations of normal sequences can be interpreted to mean that &quot;normal&quot; = &quot;finite-state random&quot;; i.e., the normal sequences are precisely those that appear random to any finite-state machine. Compare this with the algorithmically random sequences, which are those infinite sequences that appear random to any algorithm (and in fact have similar gambling and compression characterizations with Turing machines replacing finite-state machines).

== Connection to equidistributed sequences ==
A number &quot;x&quot; is normal in base &quot;b&quot; if and only if the sequence formula_26 is equidistributed modulo 1, or equivalently, using Weyl&#x27;s criterion, if and only if

formula_27

This connection leads to the terminology that &quot;x&quot; is normal in base β for any real number β if and only if the sequence formula_28 is equidistributed modulo 1.

<doc id="204278" wikidata="Q2743363" url="?curid=204278" title="Apologia Pro Vita Sua">
<text> () is John Henry Newman&#x27;s history of his religious opinions, showing how his opinions had been formed and how they had led him from Anglicanism to the Catholic Church. It was originally published as a series of pamphlets in 1864 in response to an attack by Charles Kingsley against Newman&#x27;s honesty. Though Newman&#x27;s honesty had been widely questioned for years, the &quot;Apologia&quot; was immensely successful and cleared Newman&#x27;s name. Newman published a revised version in 1865.

==Background==
Between the publication of Tract 90 in 1841 and his conversion to Catholicism in 1845, Newman had been accused of secretly working to convert people to Catholicism while outwardly professing to be Anglican, and the belief in his dishonesty during that period persisted even into the 1860s. Newman&#x27;s reputation in the early 1860s was at a low point, and he was seen as a &quot;safe object&quot; for insult and ridicule. He had refrained from answering the attacks because of their anonymity or because they had been only short gibes; however, he had decided that if someone more well-known were to make an extended and public attack against him, he would defend himself.

In the January 1864 issue of &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, Charles Kingsley, in a review of James Anthony Froude&#x27;s &quot;History of England&quot;, remarked: &quot;Truth, for its own sake, had never been a virtue with the Roman clergy. Father Newman informs us that it need not, and on the whole ought not to be.&quot; Newman received a copy of the issue on 30 December 1863; not knowing who had written the review, he wrote to the publisher noting that the accusation had not been substantiated by any evidence. Kingsley replied, justifying his comment by pointing to a sermon Newman had given in 1844, though without giving a specific passage.

Newman answered that the sermon in question had been given while he was yet Anglican, and moreover contained no such claim about the truthfulness of Catholic priests. Kingsley wrote an apology which he offered to publish, but Newman objected that, as written, it implied that Newman had explained an offending passage, while Newman contended that he had never been provided with a passage from his writings to explain. Kingsley revised the apology, and, though Newman was still dissatisfied, published it in the February issue of &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

In response, Newman published a pamphlet on 12 February containing the correspondence between himself and Kingsley along with some &quot;reflections&quot;, including a sarcastic summary of the correspondence. On 20 February, Richard Holt Hutton, editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot;, published a review of the pamphlet and summary of the controversy, concluding that Newman was in the right, though had perhaps been too harsh. Hutton praised Newman&#x27;s writing and intellect, calling him &quot;the very greatest master of delicate and polished sarcasm in the English language&quot;, and claiming that Kingsley &quot;drew down upon himself&quot; Newman&#x27;s response.

Though Newman had previously informed Kingsley that he considered Kingsley&#x27;s letters public, which Kingsley readily acknowledged as his right, Kingsley was angered by the publishing of the correspondence, viewing it as a breach of etiquette. On 20 March, he published a pamphlet entitled &quot;What, Then, Does Dr. Newman Mean?&quot;, in which, though retracting the charge of &quot;conscious dishonesty&quot;, he further attacked Newman&#x27;s truthfulness. Hutton again took Newman&#x27;s part and accused Kingsley of adding to the original offence, and there was a general feeling that Kingsley had gone too far. Newman, seeing that public opinion was in his favour, decided to take the opportunity for a fair hearing and publish a &quot;history of [his] opinions&quot;.

==Writing and publication==
Newman originally planned to deliver his response as a series of lectures, but decided that such a format would not be suitable for the personal history he intended. A complete book would also be unsuitable both because the length would deter readers and because by the time it was published, the controversy would have cooled and interest would have waned. Instead, Newman decided to publish a series of weekly pamphlets.

Newman had been sorting his papers and letters in view of someday needing to defend himself, but had only got to 1836. He asked old friends, including those from the Oxford Movement, to check his pamphlets for accuracy. He thought it providential that he had recently got back in touch with some of his Anglican friends, though he worried about asking for their help since his work would unintentionally portray Anglicanism in a negative light. However, Newman made an effort to portray both friends and enemies fairly, for which they were grateful. 

Newman described the writing as &quot;the most arduous work&quot; and &quot;one of the most terrible trials&quot; he had ever had, and said that he had been &quot;constantly in tears&quot; while writing. He frequently rewrote sections to shorten them, and spent long hours writing, quipping that &quot;[his] fingers have been &quot;walking&quot; nearly 20 miles a day&quot;. One day, he wrote for 22 hours straight in order to have the manuscript ready for the printer to collect the next morning. He found it stressful to be under a weekly deadline, needing to both write and proofread, and joked that &quot;the proof almost got ahead of the manuscript, if that can be&quot;.

The first pamphlet was published on Thursday 21 April, followed weekly by six more. An eighth pamphlet, an appendix, appeared on 16 June, two weeks after the seventh. All eight pamphlets were then published together in a single volume later that June under the title &quot;Apologia Pro Vita Sua: Being a Reply to a Pamphlet Entitled &quot;What, Then, Does Dr. Newman Mean?&quot;&quot;.

==Content==
The first two parts, entitled &quot;Mr. Kingsley&#x27;s Method of Disputation&quot; and &quot;True Mode of Meeting Mr. Kingsley&quot; respectively, were written to gain the reader&#x27;s sympathy in preparation for the following parts, and were relatively short (about 27 pages each) and light in style. In them, Newman depicts Kingsley as not intelligent enough to understand Newman, like a child trying to understand the thoughts of an adult, and accuses him of making unprovoked charges without evidence, contrary to the English sense of justice.

The third through sixth parts deal with Newman&#x27;s life, and ran longer than the first two parts, with the third being about 50 pages and the rest even longer. They do not form an autobiography in the usual sense, dealing little with his personal or spiritual life, but are rather, as he called it, a history of his opinions. The third part deals with his early life, including the formation of his religious opinions and his desire to reform the Anglican Church to prevent it from falling into apostasy. It ends with John Keble&#x27;s sermon &quot;National Apostasy&quot;, given 14 July 1833, which Newman regarded as the beginning of the Oxford Movement.

The fourth part continues through the year 1839. It details the growth of the Oxford Movement and Newman&#x27;s development of the &quot;Via Media&quot; theory in his books &quot;Prophetical Office&quot; and &quot;Lectures on Justification&quot;. During this time, he began to think about the relationship of this theory with the Anglican Thirty-nine Articles.

The fifth part details the years from 1839 to 1841. In this time, Newman&#x27;s first doubts about the Anglican Church began to arise through his study of the Monophysite conflict; he saw Anglicans in the same position in his time as the heretical Monophysites stood in the fifth century. This part also covers the publication of Tract 90, in which he attempted to reconcile the Thirty-nine Articles with Catholicism. It ends with &quot;three blows that broke&quot; him in 1841: the renewal of his doubts by seeing an analogy between Anglicans and the heretical semi-Arians; the condemnation of Tract 90 by the Anglican bishops; and the approval of the Anglo-Prussian bishopric in Jerusalem, which Newman saw as approval of Protestant heresies.

The sixth part, covering 1841 through 1845, deals with his withdrawal from public life to his chapel at Littlemore. While there, he tried to keep Anglicans in the Anglican Church, but soon came to accept Catholic doctrines. During the last two years, he retracted anti-Catholic statements in his previous writings, and began to share his thoughts with his friends. It ends with him leaving Littlemore.

The seventh part, &quot;General Answer to Mr. Kingsley&quot;, deals with his theological opinions at the time of writing. It was added in response to a concern that, while Newman was adequately defending himself from the charge of dishonesty, he was not defending the Church as a whole. In this part, Newman analyzes the teaching of Alphonsus Ligouri on lying and equivocation and compares it to that of some Protestants. He also gives his opinions on the infallibility of the Church and its relationship with theology, indirectly speaking against more extreme Catholic views. He ends this part with a dedication to the other members of the Birmingham Oratory, thanking them for their support through the years.

In the appendix, entitled &quot;Answer in Detail to Mr. Kingsley&#x27;s Accusations&quot;, Newman casts Kingsley&#x27;s charges as 39 &quot;blots&quot;, mirroring the Anglican Thirty-nine Articles. He responds to each accusation in the polemical tone of the first two parts, lest he be accused of evading the charges.

==Reception and aftermath==
The &quot;Apologia&quot; was enormously successful. Though Newman had initially expected to lose money on it, as he had on previous publications, the book sold so well that Newman&#x27;s money troubles were relieved. Newman&#x27;s defence of his honesty as an Anglican was accepted by the public, and the book marked a turning point in Newman&#x27;s reputation; he became even more popular and well-known than he had during the Oxford Movement.

Newman&#x27;s defence of the Catholic priesthood was lauded by his fellow priests. At a synod in his own diocese of Birmingham at the beginning of June, Newman received a grateful address signed by the priests of the diocese and a letter from the bishop, William Bernard Ullathorne. Newman included these and similar letters from other groups of priests and academics in an appendix of the revised edition of the &quot;Apologia&quot;.

The &quot;Apologia&quot; had a positive effect on the relations between Protestants and Catholics. Catholics gained a greater understanding of the Protestant mindset, and Protestants saw that it was possible for a reasonable person to accept Catholicism in good faith, which caused them to soften the tone used in public controversy; though Catholics might be wrong in their beliefs, they were at least not dishonest. Nonconformist Protestants in particular received the &quot;Apologia&quot; positively, and Anglicans were grateful for Newman&#x27;s kind portrayal of the Anglican Church. Anglo-Catholics, unhappy with the way Newman had been treated by Anglican authorities, rejoiced in his vindication.

Some Protestant readers, however, saw their negative impressions of Catholicism confirmed by Newman&#x27;s revelations. While accepting his honesty, they derided him as succumbing to superstition and idolatry, and even delusion and self-deception. His defence of Ligouri&#x27;s position on lying was seen as unconvincing. Some Catholics took issue with his positive portrayal of the Anglican Church, and scholastic theologians objected to his language about probability and certainty.

Kingsley had gone to France at his wife&#x27;s insistence after publishing his pamphlet and was unaware of Newman&#x27;s response until shortly before he returned home. Though Macmillan asked Kingsley to reply to the &quot;Apologia&quot;, Kingsley declined, calling Newman a &quot;treacherous ape&quot; and implying that he was insane. On Kingsley&#x27;s death in 1875, Newman wrote that he had never borne any ill will toward Kingsley, only writing as harshly as he did because he knew from experience that no one would take him seriously if he responded calmly.

In the &quot;Apologia&quot; Newman spoke of a tactic he called &quot;poisoning the wells&quot;, coining the term for the fallacy now known as poisoning the well.

==Revision==
In June 1865, Newman published a second, revised edition of the &quot;Apologia&quot; under the title &quot;History of My Religious Opinions&quot;. The controversy with Kingsley having run its course, Newman toned down the polemical parts, and Kingsley was no longer mentioned by name. Newman replaced the first two parts with a preface adapted from the second part, and the detailed reply to Kingsley in the appendix with an expanded series of notes. The seventh part, originally titled &quot;General Answer to Mr. Kingsley&quot;, was renamed &quot;Position of My Mind since 1845&quot;.

In addition to these revisions, Newman specified certain dates more precisely and included the names of individuals whom he had previously omitted. This change reflected the lack of danger, following the success of the Apologia, in associating them with him and potentially harming their reputations. Errors in the original were also fixed, and some phrasing was clarified. 

Newman made other minor changes and corrections to the text at various points after the 1865 edition, and expanded the preface and notes. The title was changed back to &quot;Apologia Pro Vita Sua&quot; in 1873, but with the subtitle &quot;Being a History of his Religious Opinions&quot;. The &quot;Apologia&quot; reached its final form around 1886.

<text>Robert of Anjou (), known as Robert the Wise (; 1276 – 20 January 1343), was King of Naples, titular King of Jerusalem and Count of Provence and Forcalquier from 1309 to 1343, the central figure of Italian politics of his time. He was the third son of King Charles II of Naples and Mary of Hungary, and during his father&#x27;s lifetime he was styled Duke of Calabria (1296–1309).

==Biography==
Robert was born around 1276, the third son of the future Charles II of Naples (then heir apparent) and his wife Mary of Hungary. His father was the son of the incumbent King of Naples, Charles of Anjou, who had established an Italian realm a decade earlier in 1266. During the Sicilian Vespers directed against his grandfather Charles, Robert was the hostage of Peter III of Aragon, his grandfather&#x27;s enemy. In 1285, Robert&#x27;s grandfather died at Foggia in Italy, leading to his father (then a hostage) becoming King of Naples as Charles II, with Robert&#x27;s elder brother, Charles Martel of Anjou as heir apparent.

After the death of his elder brother, Charles Martel of Anjou in 1295, Robert, became heir to the crown of Naples, passing over his child-nephew Charles; to obtain the crown of neighbouring Sicily, he married King James of Sicily&#x27;s sister Yolanda, in exchange for James&#x27;s renunciation of Sicily. However, the Sicilian barons refused him and elected James&#x27; brother, Frederick II. The war continued, and with the Peace of Caltabellotta (1302) Robert and the Angevin dynasty lost Sicily forever, their rule limited to the south of peninsular Italy.

Robert inherited the position of papal champion in Italy; his reign being blessed from the papal enclave within Robert&#x27;s Provence, by the French Pope Clement V, who made him papal vicar in Romagna and Tuscany, where Robert intervened in the war of factions in Florence, accepted the offered signiory of that city, but had to abandon it due to Clement&#x27;s opposition. 

The leader of the Guelph party in Italy, Robert opposed the sojourn of Emperor Henry VII in Italy (1311–13) and his occupation of Rome in 1312. After Henry&#x27;s death, the Guelph reaction against the Ghibelline leaders in northern Italy, Matteo Visconti and Cangrande della Scala, made it seem for a time that Robert would become the arbiter of Italy. Already ruler of wide possessions in Piedmont, Robert&#x27;s prestige increased further when in 1313 the pope named him Senator of Rome, and when he became Lord of Genoa (1318–34) and Brescia (1319) and from 1314 onwards held the resounding papal title of imperial vicar of all Italy, during the absence in Italy of the Holy Roman Emperor, &quot;vacante imperio&quot;.

In 1328 he fought another emperor who had ventured into Italy, Louis IV of Bavaria, and in 1330 forced John of Bohemia to quit northern Italy. Robert&#x27;s hegemony in Italy was diminished only by the constant menace of Aragonese Sicily.
When the succession to the margraviate of Saluzzo was disputed between Manfred V and his nephew Thomas II in 1336, Robert intervened on behalf of Manfred, for Thomas had married into the Ghibelline Visconti family. Robert advanced on Saluzzo and besieged it. He succeeded in taking it and sacking it, setting the city on fire and imprisoning Thomas, who had to pay a ransom. The whole dramatic incident is recorded by Silvio Pellico. However, when his viceroy Reforza d&#x27;Angoult was defeated in the Battle of Gamenario (22 April 1345), Angevin power in Piedmont began to crumble. With his second wife Sancha of Majorca, Robert established the kingdom of Naples as a center of early Renaissance culture and of religious dissent, supporting the Joachimite prophesies of the Spiritual Franciscans.

At Robert&#x27;s death in 1343, he was succeeded by his 16-year-old granddaughter, Joanna I of Naples, his son Charles having predeceased him in 1328. Joanna was already betrothed to her cousin, the 15-year-old Andrew of Hungary, son of the Angevin king of Hungary, Charles Robert. In his last will and testament Robert explicitly excluded the claims of Andrew of Hungary, clearly mandated that he become prince of Salerno and specified that Joanna alone assume the crown in her own right, to be succeeded by her legitimate offspring. If she were to die without heir, her younger sister Maria, newly named the duchess of Calabria, and her legitimate offspring would inherit the throne. There is no mention in the will that Andrew be crowned king; and this historiographical tradition is largely the result of later historians&#x27; accepting without examination the assertions of Hungarian royal propaganda following Andrew&#x27;s murder at Aversa in 1345. This propaganda, the Hungarian assault on Joanna following the murder of Andrew, and the invasion of the Regno by Louis I of Hungary eventually led to the end of Anjou-Naples rule in Naples.

==Legacy==
King Robert was nicknamed &quot;the peace-maker of Italy&quot; due to the years of significant changes he brought to Naples. The city and nation&#x27;s economy lay in the hands of Tuscan merchants, who erected superb buildings, monuments and statues that drastically changed King Robert&#x27;s capital from a dirty seaport to a city of elegance and medieval splendor. Robert commissioned Tino di Camaino to produce a tomb for his son, who should have been his heir, and Giotto painted several works for him. The University of Naples flourished under the patronage of the king dismissed by Dante as a &quot;re di sermone&quot;, &quot;king of words&quot;, attracting students from all parts of Italy. There was virtually no middle class in the South to balance the local interests and centripetal power of the entrenched aristocracy, who retained the feudal independence that had been their bargain with the Angevins&#x27; Norman predecessors.

Unusually, Robert preached sermons throughout his reign, at universities, religious houses, and on other ceremonial occasions, making use of an authoritative form of oratory ordinarily reserved for clerics. Records of hundreds of these sermons survive in extant manuscripts, providing an important case study in the history of medieval lay preaching. 

He was remembered by Petrarch and Boccaccio as a cultured man and a generous patron of the arts, &quot;unique among the kings of our day,&quot; Boccaccio claimed after Robert&#x27;s death, &quot;a friend of knowledge and virtue.&quot; Petrarch asked to be examined by Robert before being crowned as poet in the Campidoglio in Rome (1341); his Latin epic &quot;Africa&quot; is dedicated to Robert, though it was not made available to readers until 1397, long after both Petrarch and Robert were dead.

==Family==
By his first wife, Yolanda, daughter of King Peter III of Aragon, Robert had two sons:
* Charles (1298–1328), Duke of Calabria (1309), Viceroy of Naples (1318), who was the father of Queen Joanna I
* Louis (1301–10)
Robert&#x27;s second marriage, to Sancia, daughter of King James II of Majorca, was childless. He had the following extramarital children:
* Charles d&#x27;Artois, member of the regency council and grand chamberlain for Queen Joanna I, executed for murder of King Andrew
* Maria d&#x27;Aquino (Boccaccio&#x27;s Fiammetta)
* Hélène of Anjou, who fell in love with and married Andrea I Thopia, Count of Matia, without her father&#x27;s consent. Hélène was possibly due to marry Bertrand de Baux, the Bailli of Morea, or the Prince of Morea, as part of a political alliance when this happened. Thopia&#x27;s emblem contains three lilies separated by a dotted line, indicating an illegitimate child. Hélène and Andrea had Karl Thopia (likely named after Hélène&#x27;s grandfather, Charles II of Naples) and Gjergj Thopia. The marriage was not accepted by Robert, who with the pretext of reconciliation, invited the couple to Naples, where he had them executed and decapitated.

King Robert&#x27;s last descendant through a legitimate line was Queen Joanna II of Naples.

<text>Subhas Chandra Bose (23 January 1897 – 18 August 1945) was an Indian nationalist whose defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among many Indians, but his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Fascist Japan left a legacy vexed by authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure. The honorific &#x27;Netaji&#x27; (Hindustani: &quot;Respected Leader&quot;) was first applied to Bose in Germany in early 1942—by the Indian soldiers of the &quot;Indische Legion&quot; and by the German and Indian officials in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin. It is now used throughout India.

Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family in Orissa during the British Raj. The early recipient of an Anglo-centric education, he was sent after college to England to take the Indian Civil Service examination. He succeeded with distinction in the first exam but demurred at taking the routine final exam, citing nationalism to be the higher calling. Returning to India in 1921, Bose joined the nationalist movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. He followed Jawaharlal Nehru to leadership in a group within the Congress which was less keen on constitutional reform and more open to socialism. Bose became Congress president in 1938. After reelection in 1939, differences arose between him and the Congress leaders, including Gandhi, over the future federation of British India and princely states, but also because discomfort had grown among the Congress leadership over Bose&#x27;s negotiable attitude to non-violence, and his plans for greater powers for himself. After the large majority of the Congress Working Committee members resigned in protest, Bose resigned as president and was eventually ousted from the party.

In April 1941 Bose arrived in Nazi Germany, where the leadership offered unexpected but equivocal sympathy for India&#x27;s independence. German funds were employed to open a Free India Centre in Berlin. A 3,000-strong Free India Legion was recruited from among Indian POWs captured by Erwin Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps to serve under Bose. Although peripheral to their main goals, the Germans inconclusively considered a land invasion of India throughout 1941. By the spring of 1942, the German army was mired in Russia and Bose became keen to move to southeast Asia, where Japan had just won quick victories. Adolf Hitler during his only meeting with Bose in late May 1942 agreed to arrange a submarine. During this time, Bose became a father; his wife, or companion, Emilie Schenkl, gave birth to a baby girl. Identifying strongly with the Axis powers, Bose boarded a German submarine in February 1943. Off Madagascar, he was transferred to a Japanese submarine from which he disembarked in Japanese-held Sumatra in May 1943.

With Japanese support, Bose revamped the Indian National Army (INA), which comprised Indian prisoners of war of the British Indian army who had been captured by the Japanese in the Battle of Singapore. A Provisional Government of Free India (Azad Hind) was declared on the Japanese-occupied Andaman and Nicobar Islands and was nominally presided by Bose. Although Bose was unusually driven and charismatic, the Japanese considered him to be militarily unskilled, and his soldierly effort was short-lived. In late 1944 and early 1945, the British Indian Army reversed the Japanese attack on India. Almost half of the Japanese forces and fully half of the participating INA contingent were killed. The remaining INA was driven down the Malay Peninsula and surrendered with the recapture of Singapore. Bose chose to escape to Manchuria to seek a future in the Soviet Union which he believed to have turned anti-British.

Bose died from third-degree burns after his plane crashed in Japanese Taiwan on 18 August 1945. Some Indians did not believe that the crash had occurred, expecting Bose to return to secure India&#x27;s independence. The Indian National Congress, the main instrument of Indian nationalism, praised Bose&#x27;s patriotism but distanced itself from his tactics and ideology. The British Raj, never seriously threatened by the INA, charged 300 INA officers with treason in the Indian National Army trials, but eventually backtracked in the face of opposition by the Congress, and a new mood in Britain for rapid decolonisation in India. Bose&#x27;s legacy is mixed. Among many in India, he is seen as a hero, his saga serving as a would-be counterpoise to the many actions of regeneration, negotiation, and reconciliation over a quarter-century through which the independence of India was achieved. His collaborations with Japanese fascism and Nazism pose serious ethical dilemmas, especially his reluctance to publicly criticize the worst excesses of German anti-Semitism from 1938 onwards or to offer refuge in India to its victims.

== Biography ==

=== 1897–1921: Early life ===
Subhas Chandra Bose was born to Bengali parents Prabhabati Bose () and Janakinath Bose on 23 January 1897 in Cuttack—in what is today the state of Odisha in India but was part of the Bengal Presidency in British India. Prabhabati, or familiarly &quot;Mā jananī&quot; (), the anchor of family life, had her first child at age 14 and 13 children thereafter. Subhas was the ninth child and the sixth son. Jankinath, a successful lawyer and government pleader, was loyal to the government of British India and scrupulous about matters of language and the law. A self-made man from the rural outskirts of Calcutta, he had remained in touch with his roots, returning annually to his village during the &quot;pooja&quot; holidays.

Following his five older brothers, Bose entered the Baptist Mission&#x27;s Protestant European School in Cuttack in January 1902. English was the medium of all instruction in the school, the majority of the students being European or Anglo-Indians of mixed British and Indian ancestry. The curriculum included English—correctly written and spoken—Latin, the Bible, good manners, British geography, and British History; no Indian languages were taught. The choice of the school was Janakinath&#x27;s, who wanted his sons to speak flawless English with flawless intonation, believing both to be important for access to the British in India. The school contrasted with Subhas&#x27;s home, where only Bengali was spoken. At home, his mother worshipped the Hindu goddesses Durga and Kali, told stories from the epics Mahabharata and Ramayana, and sang Bengali religious songs. From her, Subhas imbibed a nurturing spirit, looking for situations in which to help people in distress, preferring gardening around the house to joining in sports with other boys. His father, who was reserved in manner and busy with professional life, was a distant presence in a large family, causing Subhas to feel he had a nondescript childhood. Still, Janakinath read English literature avidly—John Milton, William Cowper, Matthew Arnold, and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; being among his favourites; several of his sons were to become English literature enthusiasts like him.

In 1909, the 12-year-old Subhas Bose followed his five brothers to the Ravenshaw Collegiate School in Cuttack. Here, Bengali and Sanskrit were also taught, as were ideas from Hindu scriptures such as the Vedas and the Upanishads not usually picked up at home. Although his western education continued apace, he began to wear Indian clothes and engage in religious speculation. To his mother, he wrote long letters which displayed acquaintance with the ideas of the Bengali mystic Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and his disciple Swami Vivekananda, and the novel &quot;Ananda Math&quot; by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, popular then among young Hindu men. Despite the preoccupation, Subhas was able to demonstrate an ability when needed to focus on his studies, to compete, and to succeed in exams. In 1912, he secured the second position in the matriculation examination conducted under the auspices of the University of Calcutta.

Subhas Bose followed his five brothers again 1913 to Presidency College, Calcutta, the historic and traditional college for Bengal&#x27;s upper-caste Hindu men. He chose to study philosophy, his readings including Kant, Hegel, Bergson and other Western philosophers. A year earlier, he had befriended Hemanta Kumar Sarkar, a confidant and partner in religious yearnings. At Presidency, their emotional ties grew stronger. In the fanciful language of religious imagery, they declared their pure love for each other. In the long vacations of 1914, they traveled to northern India for several months to search for a spiritual guru to guide them. Subhas&#x27;s family was not told clearly about the trip, leading them to think he had run away. During the trip, in which the guru proved elusive, Subhas came down with typhoid fever. His absence caused emotional distress to his parents, leading both parents to break down upon his return. Heated words were exchanged between Janakinath and Subhas. It took the return of Subhas&#x27;s favorite brother, Sarat Chandra Bose, from law studies in England for the tempers to subside. Subhas returned to presidency and busied himself with studies, debating and student journalism.

In February 1916, Bose was alleged to have masterminded, or participated in, an incident involving E. F. Oaten, Professor of History at Presidency. Before the incident, it was claimed by the students, Oaten had made rude remarks about Indian culture, and collared and pushed some students; according to Oaten, the students were making an unacceptably loud noise just outside his class. A few days later, on 15 February, some students accosted Oaten on a stairway, surrounded him, beat him with sandals, and took to flight. An inquiry committee was constituted. Although Oaten, who was unhurt, could not identify his assailants, a college servant testified to seeing Subhas Bose among those fleeing, confirming for the authorities what they had determined to be the rumor among the students. Bose was expelled from the college and rusticated from University of Calcutta. The incident shocked Calcutta and caused anguish to Bose&#x27;s family. He was ordered back to Cuttack. His family&#x27;s connections were employed to pressure Asutosh Mukherjee, the Vice-Chancellor of Calcutta University. Despite this, Subhas Bose&#x27;s expulsion remained in place until 20 July 1917, when the Syndicate of Calcutta University granted him permission to return, but to another college. He joined Scottish Church College, receiving his B.A. in 1918 in the First Class with honours in philosophy, placing second among all philosophy students in Calcutta University.

At his father&#x27;s urging, Subhas Bose agreed to travel to England to prepare and appear for the Indian Civil Services (ICS) examination. Arriving in London on 20 October 1919, Subhas readied his application for the ICS. For his references he put down Lord Sinha of Raipur, Under Secretary of State for India, and Bhupendranath Basu, a wealthy Calcutta lawyer who sat on the Council of India in London. Bose was eager also to gain admission to a college at the University of Cambridge. It was past the deadline for admission. He sought help from some Indian students and from the Non-Collegiate Students Board. The Board offered the university&#x27;s education at an economical cost without formal admission to a college. Bose entered the register of the university on 19 November 1919 and simultaneously set about preparing for the Civil Service exams. He chose the Mental and Moral Sciences Tripos at Cambridge, its completion requirement reduced to two years on account of his Indian B. A.

There were six vacancies in the ICS. Subhas Bose took the open competitive exam for them in August 1920 and was placed fourth. This was a vital first step. Still remaining was a final examination in 1921 on more topics on India, including the Indian Penal Code, the Indian Evidence Act, Indian history, and an Indian language. Successful candidates had also to clear a riding test. Having no fear of these subjects and being a rider, Subhas Bose felt the ICS was within easy reach. Yet between August 1920 and 1921 he began to have doubts about taking the final examination. Many letters were exchanged with his father and his brother Sarat Chandra Bose back in Calcutta. In one letter to Sarat, Subhas wrote, &quot;But for a man of my temperament who has been feeding on ideas that might be called eccentric—the line of least resistance is not the best line to follow ... The uncertainties of life are not appalling to one who has not, at heart, worldly ambitions. Moreover, it is not possible to serve one&#x27;s country in the best and fullest manner if one is chained on to the civil service.&quot; In April 1921, Subhas Bose made his decision firm not to take the final examination for the ICS and wrote to Sarat informing him of the same, apologizing for the pain he would cause to his father, his mother, and other members of his family. On 22 April 1921, he wrote to the Secretary of State for India, Edwin Montagu, stating, &quot;I wish to have my name removed from the list of probationers in the Indian Civil Service.&quot; The following day he wrote again to Sarat:I received a letter from mother saying that in spite of what father and others think she prefers the ideals for which Mahatma Gandhi stands. I cannot tell you how happy I have been to receive such a letter. It will be worth a treasure for me as it has removed something like a burden from my mind.&quot;

For some time before Subhas Bose had been in touch with C. R. Das, a lawyer who had risen to the helm of politics in Bengal; Das encouraged Subhas to return to Calcutta. With the ICS decision now firmly behind him, Subhas Bose took his Cambridge B.A. Final examinations half-heartedly, passing, but being placed in the Third Class. He prepared to sail for India in June 1921, electing for a fellow Indian student to pick up his diploma.

=== 1921–1932: Indian National Congress ===
Subhas Bose, aged 24, arrived ashore in India at Bombay on the morning of 16 July 1921 and immediately set about arranging an interview with Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi, aged 51, was the leader of the non-cooperation movement that had taken India by storm the previous year and in a quarter-century would evolve to secure its independence. Gandhi happened to be in Bombay and agreed to see Bose that afternoon. In Bose&#x27;s account of the meeting, written many years later, he pilloried Gandhi with question after question. Bose thought Gandhi&#x27;s answers were vague, his goals unclear, his plan for achieving them not thought through. Gandhi and Bose differed in this first meeting on the question of means—for Gandhi non-violent means to any end were non-negotiable; in Bose&#x27;s thought, all means were acceptable in the service of anti-colonial ends. They differed on the question of ends—Bose was attracted to totalitarian models of governance, which were anathematized by Gandhi. According to historian Gordon, &quot;Gandhi, however, set Bose on to the leader of the Congress and Indian nationalism in Bengal, C. R. Das, and in him Bose found the leader whom he sought.&quot; Das was more flexible than Gandhi, more sympathetic to the extremism that had attracted idealistic young men such as Bose in Bengal. Das launched Bose into nationalist politics. Bose would work within the ambit of the Indian National Congress politics for nearly 20 years even as he tried to change its course.

In 1922 Bose founded the newspaper &quot;Swaraj&quot; and assumed charge of the publicity for the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee. His mentor was Chittaranjan Das, a voice for aggressive nationalism in Bengal. In 1923, Bose was elected the President of Indian Youth Congress and also the Secretary of the Bengal State Congress. He became the editor of the newspaper &quot;Forward&quot;, which had been founded by Chittaranjan Das. Bose worked as the CEO of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for Das when the latter was elected mayor of Calcutta in 1924. During the same year, when Bose was leading a protest march in Calcutta, he, Maghfoor Ahmad Ajazi and other leaders were arrested and imprisoned. After a roundup of nationalists in 1925, Bose was sent to prison in Mandalay, British Burma, where he contracted tuberculosis.

In 1927, after being released from prison, Bose became general secretary of the Congress party and worked with Jawaharlal Nehru for independence. In late December 1928, Bose organised the Annual Meeting of the Indian National Congress in Calcutta. His most memorable role was as General officer commanding (GOC) Congress Volunteer Corps. Author Nirad Chaudhuri wrote about the meeting: Bose organized a volunteer corps in uniform, its officers were even provided with steel-cut epaulettes ... his uniform was made by a firm of British tailors in Calcutta, Harman&#x27;s. A telegram addressed to him as GOC was delivered to the British General in Fort William and was the subject of a good deal of malicious gossip in the (British Indian) press. Mahatma Gandhi as a sincere pacifist vowed to non-violence, did not like the strutting, clicking of boots, and saluting, and he afterward described the Calcutta session of the Congress as a Bertram Mills circus, which caused a great deal of indignation among the Bengalis.
A little later, Bose was again arrested and jailed for civil disobedience; this time he emerged to become Mayor of Calcutta in 1930.

=== 1933–1937: Illness, Austria, Emilie Schenkl ===
During the mid-1930s Bose travelled in Europe, visiting Indian students and European politicians, including Benito Mussolini. He observed party organisation and saw communism and fascism in action. In this period, he also researched and wrote the first part of his book &quot;The Indian Struggle&quot;, which covered the country&#x27;s independence movement in the years 1920–1934. Although it was published in London in 1935, the British government banned the book in the colony out of fears that it would encourage unrest. Bose was supported in Europe by the Indian Central European Society organized by Otto Faltis from Vienna.

=== 1937–1940: Indian National Congress ===
In 1938 Bose stated his opinion that the INC &quot;should be organised on the broadest anti-imperialist front with the two-fold objective of winning political freedom and the establishment of a socialist regime.&quot; By 1938 Bose had become a leader of national stature and agreed to accept nomination as Congress President. He stood for unqualified Swaraj (self-governance), including the use of force against the British. This meant a confrontation with Mohandas Gandhi, who in fact opposed Bose&#x27;s presidency, splitting the Indian National Congress party.

Bose attempted to maintain unity, but Gandhi advised Bose to form his own cabinet. The rift also divided Bose and Nehru; he appeared at the 1939 Congress meeting on a stretcher. He was elected president again over Gandhi&#x27;s preferred candidate Pattabhi Sitaramayya. U. Muthuramalingam Thevar strongly supported Bose in the intra-Congress dispute. Thevar mobilised all south India votes for Bose. However, due to the manoeuvrings of the Gandhi-led clique in the Congress Working Committee, Bose found himself forced to resign from the Congress presidency.

On 22 June 1939 Bose organised the All India Forward Bloc a faction within the Indian National Congress, aimed at consolidating the political left, but its main strength was in his home state, Bengal. U Muthuramalingam Thevar, who was a staunch supporter of Bose from the beginning, joined the Forward Bloc. When Bose visited Madurai on 6 September, Thevar organised a massive rally as his reception.

When Subhas Chandra Bose was heading to Madurai, on an invitation of Muthuramalinga Thevar to amass support for the Forward Bloc, he passed through Madras and spent three days at Gandhi Peak.
His correspondence reveals that despite his clear dislike for British subjugation, he was deeply impressed by their methodical and systematic approach and their steadfastly disciplinarian outlook towards life. In England, he exchanged ideas on the future of India with British Labour Party leaders and political thinkers like Lord Halifax, George Lansbury, Clement Attlee, Arthur Greenwood, Harold Laski, J.B.S. Haldane, Ivor Jennings, G.D.H. Cole, Gilbert Murray and Sir Stafford Cripps.

He came to believe that an independent India needed socialist authoritarianism, on the lines of Turkey&#x27;s Kemal Atatürk, for at least two decades. For political reasons Bose was refused permission by the British authorities to meet Atatürk at Ankara. During his sojourn in England Bose tried to schedule appointments with several politicians, but only the Labour Party and Liberal politicians agreed to meet with him. Conservative Party officials refused to meet him or show him courtesy because he was a politician coming from a colony. In the 1930s leading figures in the Conservative Party had opposed even Dominion status for India. It was during the Labour Party government of 1945–1951, with Attlee as the Prime Minister, that India gained independence.

On the outbreak of war, Bose advocated a campaign of mass civil disobedience to protest against Viceroy Lord Linlithgow&#x27;s decision to declare war on India&#x27;s behalf without consulting the Congress leadership. Having failed to persuade Gandhi of the necessity of this, Bose organised mass protests in Calcutta calling for the removal of the &quot;Holwell Monument&quot;, which then stood at the corner of Dalhousie Square in memoriam of those who died in the Black Hole of Calcutta. He was thrown in jail by the British, but was released following a seven-day hunger strike. Bose&#x27;s house in Calcutta was kept under surveillance by the CID.

=== 1941: Escape to Nazi Germany ===

Bose&#x27;s arrest and subsequent release set the scene for his escape to Nazi Germany, via Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. A few days before his escape, he sought solitude and, on this pretext, avoided meeting British guards and grew a beard. Late night 16 January 1941, the night of his escape, he dressed as a Pathan (brown long coat, a black fez-type coat and broad pyjamas) to avoid being identified. Bose escaped from under British surveillance from his Elgin Road house in Calcutta on the night of 17 January 1941, accompanied by his nephew Sisir Kumar Bose, later reaching Gomoh Railway Station (now Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Gomoh Station) in the then state of Bihar (now Jharkhand), India.

Bose journeyed to Peshawar with the help of the Abwehr, where he was met by Akbar Shah, Mohammed Shah and Bhagat Ram Talwar. Bose was taken to the home of Abad Khan, a trusted friend of Akbar Shah&#x27;s. On 26 January 1941, Bose began his journey to reach Russia through British India&#x27;s North West frontier with Afghanistan. For this reason, he enlisted the help of Mian Akbar Shah, then a Forward Bloc leader in the North-West Frontier Province. Shah had been out of India en route to the Soviet Union and suggested a novel disguise for Bose to assume. Since Bose could not speak Pashto, it would have made him an easy target of Pashto speakers working for the British. For this reason, Shah suggested that Bose act deaf and dumb, and let his beard grow to mimic those of the tribesmen. Bose&#x27;s guide Bhagat Ram Talwar, unknown to him, was a Soviet agent.

Supporters of the Aga Khan III helped him across the border into Afghanistan where he was met by an Abwehr unit posing as a party of road construction engineers from the Organization Todt who then aided his passage across Afghanistan via Kabul to the border with the Soviet Union. After assuming the guise of a Pashtun insurance agent (&quot;Ziaudddin&quot;) to reach Afghanistan, Bose changed his guise and travelled to Moscow on the Italian passport of an Italian nobleman &quot;Count Orlando Mazzotta&quot;. From Moscow, he reached Rome, and from there he travelled to Nazi Germany. Once in Russia the NKVD transported Bose to Moscow where he hoped that Russia&#x27;s historical enmity to British rule in India would result in support for his plans for a popular rising in India. However, Bose found the Soviets&#x27; response disappointing and was rapidly passed over to the German Ambassador in Moscow, Count von der Schulenburg. He had Bose flown on to Berlin in a special courier aircraft at the beginning of April where he was to receive a more favourable hearing from Joachim von Ribbentrop and the Foreign Ministry officials at the Wilhelmstrasse.

=== 1941–1943: Collaboration with Nazi Germany ===

In Germany, Bose was attached to the Special Bureau for India under Adam von Trott zu Solz which was responsible for broadcasting on the German-sponsored Azad Hind Radio. He founded the Free India Center in Berlin and created the Indian Legion (consisting of some 4500 soldiers) out of Indian prisoners of war who had previously fought for the British in North Africa prior to their capture by Axis forces. The Indian Legion was attached to the Wehrmacht, and later transferred to the Waffen SS. Its members swore the following allegiance to Hitler and Bose: &quot;I swear by God this holy oath that I will obey the leader of the German race and state, Adolf Hitler, as the commander of the German armed forces in the fight for India, whose leader is Subhas Chandra Bose&quot;. This oath clearly abrogated control of the Indian legion to the German armed forces whilst stating Bose&#x27;s overall leadership of India. He was also, however, prepared to envisage an invasion of India via the USSR by Nazi troops, spearheaded by the Azad Hind Legion; many have questioned his judgment here, as it seems unlikely that the Germans could have been easily persuaded to leave after such an invasion, which might also have resulted in an Axis victory in the War.

Soon, according to historian Romain Hayes, &quot;the (German) Foreign Office procured a luxurious residence for (Bose) along with a butler, cook, gardener, and an SS-chauffeured car. Emilie Schenkl moved in openly with him. The Germans, aware of the nature of the relationship, refrained from any involvement.&quot; However, most of the staff in the Special Bureau for India, which had been set up to aid Bose, did not get along with Emilie. In particular Adam von Trott, Alexander Werth and Freda Kretschemer, according to historian Leonard A. Gordon, &quot;appear to have disliked her intensely. They believed that she and Bose were not married and that she was using her liaison with Bose to live an especially comfortable life during the hard times of war&quot; and that differences were compounded by issues of class. In November 1942, Schenkl gave birth to their daughter.

The Germans were unwilling to form an alliance with Bose because they considered him unpopular in comparison with Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. By the spring of 1942, the German army was mired in the USSR. Bose, due to disappointment over the lack of response from Nazi Germany, was now keen to move to Southeast Asia, where Japan had just won quick victories. However, he still expected official recognition from Nazi Germany. Adolf Hitler during his only meeting with Bose in late May 1942 refused to entertain Bose&#x27;s requests and facilitated him with a submarine voyage to East Asia.

In February 1943, Bose left Schenkl and their baby daughter and boarded a German submarine to travel, via transfer to a Japanese submarine, to Japanese-occupied southeast Asia. In all, 3,000 Indian prisoners of war signed up for the Free India Legion. But instead of being delighted, Bose was worried. A left-wing admirer of Russia, he was devastated when Hitler&#x27;s tanks rolled across the Soviet border. Matters were worsened by the fact that the now-retreating German army would be in no position to offer him help in driving the British from India. When he met Hitler in May 1942, his suspicions were confirmed, and he came to believe that the Nazi leader was more interested in using his men to win propaganda victories than military ones. So, in February 1943, Bose boarded a German U-boat and left for Japan. This left the men he had recruited leaderless and demoralised in Germany.

=== 1943–1945: Japanese-occupied Asia ===


In 1943, after being disillusioned that Germany could be of any help in gaining India&#x27;s independence, Bose left for Japan. He travelled with the German submarine U-180 around the Cape of Good Hope to the southeast of Madagascar, where he was transferred to the for the rest of the journey to Imperial Japan. This was the only civilian transfer between two submarines of two different navies in World War II.

The Indian National Army (INA) was the brainchild of Japanese Major (and post-war Lieutenant-General) Iwaichi Fujiwara, head of the Japanese intelligence unit Fujiwara Kikan. Fujiwara&#x27;s mission was &quot;to raise an army which would fight alongside the Japanese army.&quot; He first met Pritam Singh Dhillon, the president of the Bangkok chapter of the Indian Independence League, and through Pritam Singh&#x27;s network recruited a captured British Indian army captain, Mohan Singh, on the western Malayan peninsula in December 1941. The First Indian National Army was formed as a result of discussion between Fujiwara and Mohan Singh in the second half of December 1941, and the name chosen jointly by them in the first week of January 1942.

This was along the concept of, and with support of, what was then known as the Indian Independence League headed from Tokyo by expatriate nationalist leader Rash Behari Bose. The first INA was however disbanded in December 1942 after disagreements between the Hikari Kikan and Mohan Singh, who came to believe that the Japanese High Command was using the INA as a mere pawn and propaganda tool. Singh was taken into custody and the troops returned to the prisoner-of-war camp. However, the idea of an independence army was revived with the arrival of Subhas Chandra Bose in the Far East in 1943. In July, at a meeting in Singapore, Rash Behari Bose handed over control of the organisation to Subhas Chandra Bose. Bose was able to reorganise the fledgling army and organise massive support among the expatriate Indian population in south-east Asia, who lent their support by both enlisting in the Indian National Army, as well as financially in response to Bose&#x27;s calls for sacrifice for the independence cause. INA had a separate women&#x27;s unit, the Rani of Jhansi Regiment (named after Rani Lakshmi Bai) headed by Capt. Lakshmi Swaminathan, which is seen as a first of its kind in Asia.
Even when faced with military reverses, Bose was able to maintain support for the Azad Hind movement. Spoken as a part of a motivational speech for the Indian National Army at a rally of Indians in Burma on 4 July 1944, Bose&#x27;s most famous quote was &quot;Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom!&quot; In this, he urged the people of India to join him in his fight against the British Raj. Spoken in Hindi, Bose&#x27;s words are highly evocative. The troops of the INA were under the aegis of a provisional government, the Azad Hind Government, which came to produce its own currency, postage stamps, court and civil code, and was recognised by nine Axis states—Germany, Japan, Italian Social Republic, the Independent State of Croatia, the Wang Jingwei regime in Nanjing, China, a provisional government of Burma, Manchukuo and Japanese-controlled Philippines. Of those countries, five were authorities established under Axis occupation. This government participated in the so-called Greater East Asia Conference as an observer in November 1943.

The INA&#x27;s first commitment was in the Japanese thrust towards Eastern Indian frontiers of Manipur. INA&#x27;s special forces, the Bahadur Group, were involved in operations behind enemy lines both during the diversionary attacks in Arakan, as well as the Japanese thrust towards Imphal and Kohima.
The Japanese also took possession of Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 1942 and a year later, the Provisional Government and the INA were established in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands with Lt Col. Arcot Doraiswamy Loganadan  appointed its Governor General. The islands were renamed &quot;Shaheed&quot; (Martyr) and &quot;Swaraj&quot; (Independence). However, the Japanese Navy remained in essential control of the island&#x27;s administration. During Bose&#x27;s only visit to the islands in early 1944, apparently in the interest of shielding Bose from attaining a full knowledge of ultimate Japanese intentions, his Japanese hosts carefully isolated him from the local population. At that time the island&#x27;s Japanese administration had been torturing the leader of the island&#x27;s Indian Independence League, Diwan Singh, who later died of his injuries in the Cellular Jail. During Bose&#x27;s visit to the islands several locals attempted to alert Bose to Singh&#x27;s plight, but apparently without success. During this time Loganathan became aware of his lack of any genuine administrative control and resigned in protest as Governor General, later returning to the Government&#x27;s headquarters in Rangoon.

On the Indian mainland, an Indian Tricolour flag, modelled after that of the Indian National Congress, was raised for the first time in the town of Moirang, in Manipur, in north-eastern India. The adjacent towns of Kohima and Imphal were then encircled and placed under siege by divisions of the Japanese Army, working in conjunction with the Burmese National Army, and with Brigades of the INA, known as the Gandhi and Nehru Brigades. This attempt at conquering the Indian mainland had the Axis codename of Operation U-Go.

During this operation, on 6 July 1944, in a speech broadcast by the Azad Hind Radio from Singapore, Bose addressed Mahatma Gandhi as the &quot;Father of the Nation&quot; and asked for his blessings and good wishes for the war he was fighting. This was the first time that Gandhi was referred to by this appellation. The protracted Japanese attempts to take these two towns depleted Japanese resources, with Operation U-Go ultimately proving unsuccessful. Through several months of Japanese onslaught on these two towns, Commonwealth forces remained entrenched in the towns. Commonwealth forces then counter-attacked, inflicting serious losses on the Axis led forces, who were then forced into a retreat back into Burmese territory. After the Japanese defeat at the battles of Kohima and Imphal, Bose&#x27;s Provisional Government&#x27;s aim of establishing a base in mainland India was lost forever.

Still the INA fought in key battles against the British Indian Army in Burmese territory, notable in Meiktilla, Mandalay, Pegu, Nyangyu and Mount Popa. However, with the fall of Rangoon, Bose&#x27;s government ceased to be an effective political entity. A large proportion of the INA troops surrendered under Lt Col Loganathan. The remaining troops retreated with Bose towards Malaya or made for Thailand. Japan&#x27;s surrender at the end of the war also led to the surrender of the remaining elements of the Indian National Army. The INA prisoners were then repatriated to India and some tried for treason.

=== 18 August 1945: Death ===

Subhas Chandra Bose died on 18 August 1945 from third-degree burns after his airplane crashed in Japanese-ruled Formosa (now Taiwan). However, many among his supporters, especially in Bengal, refused at the time, and have refused since, to believe either the fact or the circumstances of his death. Conspiracy theories appeared within hours of his death and have thereafter had a long shelf life, keeping alive various martial myths about Bose.

In Taihoku, at around 2:30pm as the bomber with Bose on board was leaving the standard path taken by aircraft during take-off, the passengers inside heard a loud sound, similar to an engine backfiring. The mechanics on the tarmac saw something fall out of the plane. It was the portside engine, or a part of it, and the propeller. The plane swung wildly to the right and plummeted, crashing, breaking into two, and exploding into flames. Inside, the chief pilot, copilot and Lieutenant-General Tsunamasa Shidei, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, who was to have made the negotiations for Bose with the Soviet army in Manchuria, were instantly killed. Bose&#x27;s assistant Habibur Rahman was stunned, passing out briefly, and Bose, although conscious and not fatally hurt, was soaked in gasoline. When Rahman came to, he and Bose attempted to leave by the rear door, but found it blocked by the luggage. They then decided to run through the flames and exit from the front. The ground staff, now approaching the plane, saw two people staggering towards them, one of whom had become a human torch. The human torch turned out to be Bose, whose gasoline-soaked clothes had instantly ignited. Rahman and a few others managed to smother the flames, but also noticed that Bose&#x27;s face and head appeared badly burned. According to Joyce Chapman Lebra, &quot;A truck which served as ambulance rushed Bose and the other passengers to the Nanmon Military Hospital south of Taihoku.&quot; The airport personnel called Dr. Taneyoshi Yoshimi, the surgeon-in-charge at the hospital at around 3pm. Bose was conscious and mostly coherent when they reached the hospital, and for some time thereafter. Bose was naked, except for a blanket wrapped around him, and Dr. Yoshimi immediately saw evidence of third-degree burns on many parts of the body, especially on his chest, doubting very much that he would live. Dr. Yoshimi promptly began to treat Bose and was assisted by Dr. Tsuruta. According to historian Leonard A. Gordon, who interviewed all the hospital personnel later,

A disinfectant, Rivamol , was put over most of his body and then a white ointment was applied and he was bandaged over most of his body. Dr. Yoshimi gave Bose four injections of Vita Camphor and two of Digitamine for his weakened heart. These were given about every 30 minutes. Since his body had lost fluids quickly upon being burnt, he was also given Ringer solution intravenously. A third doctor, Dr. Ishii gave him a blood transfusion. An orderly, Kazuo Mitsui, an army private, was in the room and several nurses were also assisting. Bose still had a clear head which Dr. Yoshimi found remarkable for someone with such severe injuries.

Soon, in spite of the treatment, Bose went into a coma. A few hours later, between 9 and 10 pm (local time) on Saturday, 18 August 1945, Bose died aged 48.

Bose&#x27;s body was cremated in the main Taihoku crematorium two days later, 20 August 1945. On 23 August 1945, the Japanese news agency Do Trzei announced the death of Bose and Shidea. On 7 September a Japanese officer, Lieutenant Tatsuo Hayashida, carried Bose&#x27;s ashes to Tokyo, and the following morning they were handed to the president of the Tokyo Indian Independence League, Rama Murti. On 14 September a memorial service was held for Bose in Tokyo and a few days later the ashes were turned over to the priest of the Renkōji Temple of Nichiren Buddhism in Tokyo. There they have remained ever since.

Among the INA personnel, there was widespread disbelief, shock, and trauma. Most affected were the young Tamil Indians from Malaya and Singapore, both men and women, who comprised the bulk of the civilians who had enlisted in the INA. The professional soldiers in the INA, most of whom were Punjabis, faced an uncertain future, with many fatalistically expecting reprisals from the British. In India the Indian National Congress&#x27;s official line was succinctly expressed in a letter Mohandas Karamchand (Mahatma) Gandhi wrote to Rajkumari Amrit Kaur. Said Gandhi, &quot;Subhas Bose has died well. He was undoubtedly a patriot, though misguided.&quot; Many congressmen had not forgiven Bose for quarrelling with Gandhi and for collaborating with what they considered was Japanese fascism. The Indian soldiers in the British Indian army, some two and a half million of whom had fought during the Second World War, were conflicted about the INA. Some saw the INA as traitors and wanted them punished; others felt more sympathetic. The British Raj, though never seriously threatened by the INA, tried 300 INA officers for treason in the INA trials, but eventually backtracked.

== Ideology ==

Subhas Chandra Bose believed that the Bhagavad Gita was a great source of inspiration for the struggle against the British. Swami Vivekananda&#x27;s teachings on universalism, his nationalist thoughts and his emphasis on social service and reform had all inspired Subhas Chandra Bose from his very young days. The fresh interpretation of India&#x27;s ancient scriptures had appealed immensely to him. Some scholars think that Hindu spirituality formed an essential part of his political and social thought. As historian Leonard Gordon explains &quot;Inner religious explorations continued to be a part of his adult life. This set him apart from the slowly growing number of atheistic socialists and communists who dotted the Indian landscape.&quot;

Bose first expressed his preference for &quot;a synthesis of what modern Europe calls socialism and fascism&quot; in a 1930 speech in Calcutta.
Bose later criticized Nehru&#x27;s 1933 statement that there is &quot;no middle road&quot; between communism and fascism, describing it as &quot;fundamentally wrong&quot;. Bose believed communism would not gain ground in India due to its rejection of nationalism and religion and suggested a &quot;synthesis between communism and fascism&quot; could take hold instead. In 1944, Bose similarly stated, &quot;Our philosophy should be a synthesis between National Socialism and communism.&quot;

===Authoritarianism===

Bose believed that authoritarianism could bring liberation and reconstruction of Indian society. He expressed admiration for the authoritarian methods which he saw in Italy and Germany during the 1930s; he thought they could be used to build an independent India.

To a large number of Congress leaders, Bose programme shared enough similarities with Japanese fascists. After getting marginalized within Congress, Bose chose to embrace fascist regimes as allies against the British and fled India. Bose believed that India &quot;must have a political system—State—of an authoritarian character,&quot; and &quot;a strong central government with dictatorial powers for some years to come&quot;.

Earlier, Bose had clearly expressed his belief that democracy was the best option for India. However, during the war (and possibly as early as the 1930s), Bose seems to have decided that no democratic system could be adequate to overcome India&#x27;s poverty and social inequalities, and he wrote that a socialist state similar to that of Soviet Russia (which he had also seen and admired) would be needed for the process of national re-building. Accordingly, some suggest that Bose&#x27;s alliance with the Axis during the war was based on more than just pragmatism and that Bose was a militant nationalist, though not a Nazi nor a Fascist, for he supported the empowerment of women, secularism and other liberal ideas; alternatively, others consider he might have been using populist methods of mobilisation common to many post-colonial leaders.

===Anti-semitism===

Since before the beginning of the World War II, Bose was opposed to the attempts to grant Jewish refugees asylum in India. The great anti-Jewish pogrom called &quot;the Night of Broken Glass&quot; happened on 9 November 1938. In early December, the pro-Hindu Mahasabha journals published articles lending support to German anti-Semitism. This stance brought Hindu Mahasabha into conflict with the Congress which, on 12 December, issued a statement containing references to recent European events. Within the Congress, only Bose opposed this stance of the party. After some months in April 1939, Bose refused to support the party motion that Jews can find refuge in India.

In 1938, Bose had denounced Nazi racial policy and persecution of Jews. However, in 1942 he had published an article in the journal &quot;Angriff&quot;, where he wrote that Indians were true Aryans and the &#x27;brethren&#x27; of the Germans. Bose added that Swastika (symbol of Nazi Germany) was an ancient Indian symbol. Bose urged that anti-Semitism should be part of Indian liberation movement because the Jews assisted the British to exploit Indians. &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; had condemned Bose as &quot;India&#x27;s anti-Jewish Quisling&quot; over this article.

Roman Hayes describes the troubled legacy of Bose with atrocities related to Jews in the following words:–

&quot;The most troubling aspect of Bose&#x27;s presence in Nazi Germany is not military or political but rather ethical. His alliance with the most genocidal regime in history poses serious dilemmas precisely because of his popularity and his having made a lifelong career of fighting the &#x27;good cause&#x27;. How did a man who started his political career at the feet of Gandhi end up with Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo? Even in the case of Mussolini and Tojo, the gravity of the dilemma pales in comparison to that posed by his association with Hitler and the Nazi leadership. The most disturbing issue, all too often ignored, is that in the many articles, minutes, memorandums, telegrams, letters, plans, and broadcasts Bose left behind in Germany, he did not express the slightest concern or sympathy for the millions who died in the concentration camps. Not one of his Berlin wartime associates or colleagues ever quotes him expressing any indignation. Not even when the horrors of Auschwitz and its satellite camps were exposed to the world upon being liberated by Soviet troops in early 1945, revealing publicly for the first time the genocidal nature of the Nazi regime, did Bose react.&quot;

== Quotes ==
His most famous quote was &quot;Give me blood and I will give you freedom&quot;. Another famous quote was &quot;Dilli Chalo&quot; (&quot;On to Delhi)!&quot; This was the call he used to give the INA armies to motivate them. Another slogan coined by him was &quot;Ittefaq, Etemad, Qurbani&quot; (Urdu for &quot;Unity, Agreement, Sacrifice&quot;).

== Legacy ==

Bose&#x27; defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among many Indians, however his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy fraught with authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure.

<text>Oskar Kokoschka (1 March 1886 – 22 February 1980) was an Austrian artist, poet, playwright, and teacher best known for his intense expressionistic portraits and landscapes, as well as his theories on vision that influenced the Viennese Expressionist movement.

==Early life==
The second child of Gustav Josef Kokoschka, a goldsmith, and Maria Romana Kokoschka (née Loidl), Oskar Kokoschka was born in Pöchlarn. He had a sister, Berta, born in 1889; a brother, Bohuslav, born in 1892; and an elder brother who died in infancy. Oskar had a strong belief in omens, spurred by a story of a fire breaking out in Pöchlarn shortly after his mother gave birth to him. The family&#x27;s life was not easy, largely due to a lack of financial stability of his father. They constantly moved into smaller flats, farther and farther from the thriving centre of the town. Concluding that his father was inadequate, Kokoschka drew closer to his mother; and seeing himself as the head of the household, he continued to support his family when he gained financial independence. Kokoschka entered a &quot;Realschule&quot; in 1897, a type of secondary school, where emphasis was placed on the study of modern subjects such as the sciences and language. Despite his intent of continuing a formal education in chemistry, Kokoschka was not interested in such subjects, as he only excelled in art, and spent most of his time reading classic literature during his lessons. Like many of Kokoschka&#x27;s French and German contemporaries, he was interested in the primitive and exotic art featured in the ethnographical exhibits around Europe.

== Education ==

One of Kokoschka&#x27;s teachers suggested he pursue a career in the fine arts after being impressed by some of his drawings. Against his father&#x27;s will, Kokoschka applied to the Kunstgewerbeschule in Vienna, now the University of Applied Arts Vienna. He received a scholarship and was one of few applicants to be accepted. The Vienna Kunstgewerbeschule was a progressive school of applied arts that focused mainly on architecture, furniture, crafts, and modern design. Unlike the more prestigious and traditional Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, the Kunstgewerbeschule was dominated by instructors of the Vienna Secession. Kokoschka studied there from 1904 to 1909 and was influenced by his teacher Carl Otto Czeschka in developing an original style.

Among Kokoschka&#x27;s early works were gesture drawings of children, which portrayed them as awkward and corpse-like. Kokoschka had no formal training in painting and so approached the medium without regard to the &quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;correct&quot; way to paint. The teachers at the Kunstgewerbeschule helped Kokoschka gain opportunities through the Wiener Werkstätte or Viennese Workshops. Kokoschka&#x27;s first commissions were postcards and drawings for children. Later, Kokoschka said that this exercise provided &quot;the basis of [his] artistic training&quot;. His early career was marked by portraits of Viennese celebrities, painted in a nervously animated style.

Following his own artistic training, Kokoschka dedicated years of his life thereafter teaching art and writing articles and speeches documenting his views and practices as an educator. 17th-century Czech humanist and education reformer, Jan Amos Comenius, was Kokoschka’s primary influence in terms of how to approach education. From Comenius’s theories, Kokoschka adopted the belief that students benefit most from using their five senses to facilitate reasoning. Kokoschka taught in Vienna from 1911 to 1913 and then again in Dresden from 1919 to 1923. While his efforts as a teacher were noted in various publications, they generally focused on his personality captured within his own art rather than his classroom practices. Kokoschka neglected the conventional structured methodologies and theories assumed by art educators, and instead taught through storytelling infused with mythological themes and dramatic emotion. In 1912, Kokoschka delivered his essay “Von der Natur der Gesichte” (“On the Nature of Visions”) at the Akademischen Verband für Literatur und Musik in Vienna. This essay outlined Kokoschka’s artistic conceptualization about the relationship between inner vision and optical sight. In considering his own art, Kokoschka expressed that inspiration stemmed from daily observations that he collected optically while engaging with his contemporary surroundings. Kokoschka’s ability to acknowledge how these stimulations manifested within his inner imagination resulted in works that draw upon the subconscious rather than optical vision. Further, Kokoschka granted the viewer with the task of interpreting the image based upon how they experience the vision within their own realm of consciousness. This concept, in congruency with Wassily Kandinsky’s theory pertaining to spirituality in art, has become the basis for which art historians understand Viennese Expressionism.

== Career ==

=== Vienna Avant-Garde ===

In 1908 Kokoschka was offered the opportunity of submitting works to the first Vienna &quot;Kunstschau.&quot; This government funded exhibition was established to both bring in tourists and affirm Vienna&#x27;s prominence within the art world. Kokoschka received a commission from the Director of the Wiener Werkstätte, Fritz Wärndorfer, for color images that would supplement a children’s book and be displayed at the exhibition. Kokoschka, however, took the liberty of producing images that would serve as illustrations to the poem he wrote a year earlier, &quot;Die träumenden Knaben (The Dreaming Youths)&quot;, which took on the form of an autobiographical adolescent fantasy that was inappropriate for a young audience. In his autobiography, Kokoschka explained the origins of the poem, which follow his personal experience as a young student who was in love with his Swedish classmate, Lilith. &quot;Die träumenden Knaben&quot; consists of introductory pages with two small black and white lithographs, in addition to eight larger color lithographs with a vertical column of text positioned beside each image. Influenced by the compositions found in medieval art, Kokoschka depicted various moments in time simultaneously within each individual image. Kokoschka also adopted the bold lines and expressive colors of traditional European folk art and juxtaposed them with the stylized ornamentation and two-dimensional bodies of Jugendstil. The final page, titled &quot;Das Mädchen Li und ich&quot; (the Girl Li and I), features the angular forms of the young boy (Kokoschka) and girl (Lilith), taking on the style of the Belgian sculptor George Minne. This work, which Kokoschka dedicated to his former teacher Gustav Klimt, demonstrates the transition from Jugendstil to Expressionism.

&quot;Die träumenden Knaben&quot; along with the tapestry titled &quot;The Dream Bearers&quot;, which is now lost, were the first works ever to be exhibited by Kokoschka. Like the book illustrations, Kokoschka’s tapestry was considered disturbing due to its depiction of youthful, exotic and sexualized fantasies. Upon showing these two works, Kokoschka was subject to a backlash from conservative officials and only a small proportion of the five hundred copies of &quot;Die träumenden Knaben&quot; were actually bound and sold. As a result, he was expelled from the Kunstgewerbeschule and found his place within the Viennese avant-garde. Austrian architect Adolf Loos befriended Kokoschka and introduced him to other avant-garde members who then became his subjects in a series of portrait paintings.

=== Portraiture ===

Kokoschka painted a bulk of his portraiture between 1909 and 1914. Unlike many of his contemporaries who were also receiving portrait commissions, such as Edvard Munch, Kokoschka maintained complete artistic freedom because they were generally not ordered directly by the sitter. A majority of Kokoschka’s subjects were clients of the architect Loos, and it was Loos who ordered the portraits and agreed to purchase them if the sitter chose not to. Other portraits by Kokoschka feature friends and advocates within his circle who supported the modern art of this period. Prominent members of this group who had their portraits painted include the art dealer Herwarth Walden, art supporter Lotte Franzos, poet Peter Altenberg, and art historians Hans and Erica Tietze.

Kokoschka’s portraits demonstrate the conventions of traditional portraiture, primarily regarding the perspective in which he captures the sitters. However, Kokoschka also adopted elements of the modern style which involved incorporating hands within the composition to further capture the emotion expressed through an individual&#x27;s gestures. These portraits also utilize the unconscious positioning of the sitter’s body, which Kokoschka believed would unveil the inner tensions of their subconscious.

Kokoschka’s portraits incorporate an expressive color palette similar to those featured in the works of German Die Brücke artists at the time. Kokoschka’s use of shrill, harsh colors that make the subjects appear as rotting corpses is not meant to be understood as a portrayal of their individual physical conditions, but rather an overarching indication of a decomposing age. The bold lines and patches of bright color juxtaposed against an otherwise solid, dull background were visual interpretations of the anxieties felt by Kokoschka and those in circle. Kokoschka’s portraits, however, differed from those of his contemporaries due to his belief in the symbolic importance of the act of painting itself, which is emphasized by visible brushstrokes and areas of exposed canvas. Kokoschka integrated painterly techniques with those used in drawing, as seen in his use of vibrant and contrasting colors, rapid brushstrokes, anxious scratch marks, and uneven handling.

In a letter from 1909, Kokoschka noted that he “would like to do a nervously disordered portrait.” With no additional elements to establish a narrative for the sitter, Kokoschka stressed that the essence of the individual comes out through the means of creating their image. Patrick Werkner, an art historian, describes Kokoschka’s portraits by suggesting that it is as if the skin becomes separated from the body, allowing the viewer to see through the physiognomy like a veil only to make visible the means of depiction. Kokoschka’s portraits as a whole comment on the overwhelming feelings of uncertainty felt by those who were aware of the shifting cultural milieu leading up the end of the old order of the Austrian Empire in 1918.

Kokoschka’s portrait, &quot;Hans Tietze and Erica Tietze-Conrat&quot;, was painted in 1909 in the library of the couple’s home. Aside from being close friends of the artist, the couple were also prominent art historians of the time. Erica Tietze-Conrat explained that while Kokoschka was creating their portrait, he encouraged them to move freely and continue their work at the two desks that were situated adjacent to one another by a window. After painting her husband in profile, Kokoschka asked Erica to position herself so that he could paint her frontally. Shortly after beginning the painting, Kokoschka set down his paintbrush and began using only his fingers. Kokoschka used his fingernails to scratch thin lines into the paint, which appear in outlines and areas of hatching and crosshatching, as well as throughout the background. Although painted in their library, the figures appear to be existing in a surreal, subliminal space. Kokoschka blends vibrant tones of blue and red upon an otherwise muted green background. In the portrait, the couple do not face each other, but their hands reach out as if they are about to touch. Their hands then become the means of communication, symbolizing the bridge for which their inner energies may flow back and forth. The couple was forced to flee Austria in 1938 as a result of their Jewish heritage, but were able to take with them this portrait that they refused to exhibit until it was purchased by the Museum of Modern Art in 1939.

=== Berlin ===
Kokoschka moved to Berlin in 1910, the same year the Neue Secession was established in Berlin. The group, composed of artists and philosophers such as Emil Nolde, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Erich Heckel and Max Pechstein, formed as a rebellion against the older Secession group. While Kokoschka refrained from adopting the group&#x27;s techniques and ideologies, he did admire the sense of community established between its members. Berlin art dealer Paul Cassirer saw promise in Kokoschka&#x27;s works and launched the artist into the international circle. Around the same time, Herwarth Walden, a publisher and art critic who was introduced to Kokoschka by Loos, employed Kokoschka as an illustrator for his magazine &quot;Der Sturm&quot;. Twenty-eight drawings by Kokoschka were published in the magazine during its first year; and although he was featured significantly less, Kokoschka remained a contributor to the periodical. Kokoschka&#x27;s first piece for &quot;Der Sturm,&quot; a drawing from the series &quot;Menschenköpfe (People&#x27;s Heads),&quot; was dedicated to Karl Kraus. The twentieth Issue of the periodical featured both Kokoschka&#x27;s first cover illustration, which supplemented &quot;Mörder, Hoffnung der Frauen&quot;, as well as the artist&#x27;s first literary contribution. Kokoschka continued to travel back and forth between Vienna and Berlin over the next four years.

Kokoschka had a passionate, often stormy affair with Alma Mahler. It began in 1912, five years after the death of her four-year-old daughter Maria Mahler and two years before her affair with Walter Gropius, later a celebrated architect in Berlin. But after two years together, Alma rejected him, explaining that she was afraid of being too overcome with passion. She married Walter Gropius in 1915 and lived with him until their divorce in 1920. Kokoschka continued to love Alma Mahler his entire life, and one of his most acclaimed works, &quot;The Bride of the Wind&quot; (&quot;The Tempest&quot;; 1913), is expressive of their relationship. The poet Georg Trakl visited the studio while Kokoschka was painting this masterpiece. Kokoschka&#x27;s poem &quot;Allos Makar&quot; was inspired by this relationship.

=== World War I ===
He volunteered for service as a cavalryman in the Austrian army in World War I, and in 1915 was seriously wounded. At the hospital, the doctors decided that he was mentally unstable. Nevertheless, he continued to develop his career as an artist, traveling across Europe and painting the landscape. 

He commissioned a life-sized female doll in 1918. Although intended to simulate Alma and receive his affection, the &#x27;Alma doll&#x27; did not satisfy Kokoschka and he destroyed it during a party.

In 1919, Kokoschka began teaching at the Kunstakademie Dresden. In an open letter addressed to the inhabitants of Dresden from 1920, Kokoschka argued that the civil war battles between the revolutionary parties should be moved outside of the city’s borders in order to protect the art which could not escape the crossfire. This letter was penned after an incident on 15 March 1920 when a bullet damaged &quot;Bathsheba at the Fountain&quot;, a painting by Peter Paul Rubens. As a result of his letter, Kokoschka received backlash from the Communist artists George Grosz and John Heartfield in what was referred to as the &quot;Kunstlump&quot; debate, or Art Scoundrel Debate. Many other artists, however, continued to support the work of Kokoschka.

In May 1922 he attended the International Congress of Progressive Artists and signed the &quot;Founding Proclamation of the Union of Progressive International Artists&quot;.

Kokoschka returned to Vienna in the autumn of 1931, where he spent six months in the home he had purchased for his parents eleven years earlier. Located in Vienna’s 16th District known as Liebharstal, the house, now functioning as the artist’s studio, provided a view of Schloss Wilhelminenberg which had been converted into a Kinderheim, or orphanage, by the City Council. During this time, Kokoschka accepted a commission by the Social Democratic City Council, ‘Red Vienna,’ for a painting that would be hung inside the Rathaus, or City Hall. Kokoschka, along with other Austrian artists, was asked to create an artwork depicting Vienna in contribution to this project managed by the Historisches Museum der Stadt (Wien Museum). In honor of the humanitarian efforts of the City Counsel, Kokoschka decided to illustrate children playing outside of the palace in the foreground of the composition which otherwise consisted of a cityscape. Other identifiable Viennese architecture within the painting includes the City Hall and St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral.

=== &quot;Degeneracy&quot; and World War II ===
Deemed a &quot;degenerate&quot; by the Nazis, Kokoschka fled Austria in 1934 for Prague. In Prague his name was adopted by a group of other expatriate artists, the Oskar-Kokoschka-Bund (OKB), though Kokoschka declined participation with their group. He obtained Czechoslovak citizenship in 1935. In 1938, when the Czechs began to mobilize for the expected invasion by the Wehrmacht, he fled to the United Kingdom and remained there during the war. With the help of the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia (later the &quot;Czech Refugee Trust Fund&quot;), all members of the OKB were able to escape through Poland and Sweden.

During World War II, Kokoschka painted anti-Fascist works such as the allegory &quot;What We Are Fighting For&quot; (1943). Kokoschka left the bustling city center of London and settled in Polperro, in Cornwall. While residing in this seaside village, Kokoschka made paintings depicting landscapes of the harbor, along with &quot;The Crab&quot;, which began a series of works embedded with political allegories resisting the Nazi regime. Kokoschka’s &quot;The Crab&quot; was painted between 1939 and 1940, and captures the view of the harbor from the artist’s house in Polperro. This work functions as a self-portrait of the artist, where Kokoschka is the swimmer representing Czechoslovakia. The large crab is symbolic of Neville Chamberlain, the British Prime Minister at the time the painting was created. In explaining this painting, Kokoschka said the crab “would only have to put out one claw to save him from drowning, but remains aloof.” Further, this painting demonstrates the instability he felt as a result of German occupation forcing him to seek refuge in other countries across Europe. This landscape painting, amongst others by Kokoschka, were brought with him to London unfinished where they were transformed into political allegories. While in London, Kokoschka also painted &quot;The Red Egg,&quot; another political painting referencing the destruction of Czechoslovakia. In this satirical painting, Kokoschka comments on the Munich Agreement of 1938 with grotesque caricatures of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler.

During several summer months, he and his young Czech wife, Oldřiška “Olda” Palkovská Kokoschka (1915–2009), lived in Ullapool, a village in Wester Ross, Scotland. There he drew with coloured pencil (a technique he developed in Scotland), and painted many local landscape views in watercolour. While in Ullapool, Kokoschka painted a portrait of his friend, the wealthy industrialist Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, Uncle of Maria Altmann. The painting hangs at the Kunsthaus Museum in Zurich. Between 1941–1946 he and Olda spent several weeks each summer with the Czech Professor Emil Korner at his home The House of Elrig in Wigtownshire.

== Later life ==
Kokoschka naturalised as a British subject on 21 February 1947 and would only regain Austrian citizenship in 1978. He travelled briefly to the United States in 1947 before settling in Villeneuve, Switzerland in 1953, where he lived the rest of his life. Kokoschka spent these years as an educator at the Internationale Sommer Akademie für Bildenden Künste, (Ricarda Jacobi being one of his pupils) while also working on stage designs and publishing a collection of his writings. A retrospective of Kokoschka&#x27;s work was exhibited at the Tate Gallery in London in 1962. As a member of the Deutscher Künstlerbund, Oskar Kokoschka took part in its annual exhibitions from 1952 to 1955.[16] He took part in documenta 1 (1955), documenta II (1959), and also documenta III in 1964 in Kassel. In 1966 he won the competition for the commissioned portrait of Konrad Adenauer for the German Bundestag against his competitor Eugen Denzel.

Kokoschka died on 22 February 1980 in Montreux, at the age of 93, eight days before his 94th birthday, of complications after contracting influenza. He was interred in the Montreux Central Cemetery.

Kokoschka had much in common with his contemporary Max Beckmann. Both maintained their independence from German Expressionism, yet are now regarded as textbook examples of the style. Nonetheless, their individualism set both apart from the main movements of twentieth-century modernism. Both wrote eloquently of the need to develop the art of &quot;seeing&quot; (Kokoschka emphasized depth perception while Beckmann was concerned with mystical insight into the invisible realm), and both were masters of innovative oil-painting techniques anchored in earlier traditions.

==Honours==
Kokoschka was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1959 New Year Honours. He also received the Erasmus Prize in 1960 together with Marc Chagall.

==Writings==
Kokoschka&#x27;s literary works are as peculiar and interesting as his art. His memoir, &quot;A Sea Ringed with Visions&quot;, details his theories of both corporeal and visceral vision and how they shape consciousness, art, and realities. His short play &quot;Murderer, the Hope of Women&quot; (1909, set ten years later by Paul Hindemith as &quot;Mörder, Hoffnung der Frauen&quot;) is often called the first Expressionist drama. His &quot;Orpheus und Eurydike&quot; (1918) became an opera by Ernst Krenek, who was first approached for incidental music.

<text>Dinokaryota is a main grouping of dinoflagellates. They include all species where the nucleus remains a dinokaryon throughout the entire cell cycle, which is typically dominated by the haploid stage. All the &quot;typical&quot; dinoflagellates, such as &quot;Peridinium&quot; and &quot;Gymnodinium&quot;, belong here. Others are more unusual, including some that are colonial, amoeboid, or parasitic. &quot;Symbiodinium&quot; contains the symbiotic zooxanthellae.

The non-photosynthetic members are believed to derive from photosynthetic ancestors.

==Classification==
Dinoflagellates are classified by morphology.

===With a theca===
Species with a theca are divided into four orders, based on the arrangement of the armor plates:

* Dinophysiales - e.g. &quot;Dinophysis&quot;
* Gonyaulacales - e.g. &quot;Ceratium&quot;, &quot;Gonyaulax&quot;
* Peridiniales - e.g. &quot;Peridinium&quot;
* Prorocentrales - e.g. &quot;Prorocentrum&quot;

The Peridiniales are probably paraphyletic to the others, and on rRNA trees they are mixed with the species that lack thecae. The other three orders are probably monophyletic, with the Dinophysiales and Prorocentrales as close relatives, united by the presence of a sagittal suture dividing the theca in two.

However, on rRNA trees the Prorocentrales are split up.

===Without theca===
The groups of dinoflagellates without theca are understood to be artificial, and are mostly polyphyletic. Many of the genera, such as &quot;Gymnodinium&quot; and &quot;Amphidinium&quot;, are also polyphyletic. However some may approximate monophyletic groups, such as the Suessiales, and some have not been studied phylogenetically.

* Gymnodiniales - e.g. &quot;Gymnodinium&quot;, &quot;Amphidinium&quot;
* Ptychodiscales
* Suessiales - e.g. &quot;Symbiodinium&quot;
* Desmocapsales
* Phytodiniales (includes Dinococcales, Dinotrichales) - e.g. &quot;Dinamoeba&quot;, &quot;Pfiesteria&quot;
* Thoracosphaerales

===Blastodiniales===
There is also a group of parasitic dinoflagellates, the Blastodiniales, that do not have dinokarya during their trophic stage. Because of this, they have been treated as a separate class Blastodiniphyceae, but some or all may actually have developed within the Dinophyceae.

<text>The English Poor Laws were a system of poor relief in England and Wales that developed out of the codification of late-medieval and Tudor-era laws in 1587–1598. The system continued until the modern welfare state emerged in the late 1940s.

English Poor Law legislation can be traced back as far as 1536, when legislation was passed to deal with the impotent poor, although there were much earlier Plantagenet laws dealing with the problems caused by vagrants and beggars. The history of the Poor Law in England and Wales is usually divided between two statutes: the Old Poor Law passed during the reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603) and the New Poor Law, passed in 1834, which significantly modified the system of poor relief. The New Poor Law altered the system from one which was administered haphazardly at a local parish level to a highly centralised system which encouraged the large-scale development of workhouses by poor law unions.

The Poor Law system fell into decline at the beginning of the 20th century owing to factors such as the introduction of the Liberal welfare reforms and the availability of other sources of assistance from friendly societies and trade unions, as well as piecemeal reforms which bypassed the Poor Law system. The Poor Law system was not formally abolished until the National Assistance Act 1948 (11 &amp; 12 Geo. 6. c. 29), with parts of the law remaining on the books until 1967.

== History ==

=== Medieval Poor Laws ===

The earliest medieval Poor Law was the Ordinance of Labourers of King Edward III, issued in 1349 and revised in 1350. The ordinance was issued in response to the 1348–1350 outbreak of the Black Death in England, when an estimated 30–40% of the population died. The decline in population left surviving workers in great demand in the agricultural economy. Landowners had to face the choice of raising wages to compete for workers or letting their lands go unused. Wages for labourers rose, and this forced up prices across the economy as goods became more expensive to produce. An attempt to rein in prices, the ordinance (and subsequent acts, such the Statute of Labourers of 1351) required that everyone who could work did; that wages were kept at pre-plague levels; and that food was not overpriced. Workers saw these shortage conditions as an opportunity to flee employers and become freemen, so Edward III passed additional laws to provide for the punishment of the wave of escapee workers. In addition, the Statute of Cambridge, passed in 1388, placed restrictions on the movement of labourers and beggars.

=== Tudor Poor Law ===

The origins of the English Poor Law system can be traced back to late medieval statutes dealing with beggars and vagrancy, but it was only during the Tudor period that the Poor Law system was codified. Before the Dissolution of the Monasteries during the Tudor Reformation, monasteries had been the primary source of poor relief, but their dissolution resulted in poor relief moving from a largely voluntary basis to a compulsory tax that was collected at a parish level. Early legislation was concerned with vagrants and making the able-bodied work, especially while labour was in short supply following the Black Death.

Tudor attempts to tackle the problem originated during the reign of Henry VII. In 1495, Parliament passed the Vagabonds and Beggars Act, ordering that &quot;vagabonds, idle and suspected persons shall be set in the stocks for three days and three nights and have none other sustenance but bread and water and then shall be put out of Town. Every beggar suitable to work shall resort to the Hundred where he last dwelled, is best known, or was born and there remain upon the pain aforesaid.&quot; Although this returned the burden of caring for the jobless to the communities producing more children than they could employ, it offered no immediate remedy to the problem of poverty; it was merely swept from sight, or moved from town to town. Moreover, no distinction was made between vagrants and the jobless; both were simply categorised as &quot;sturdy beggars&quot;, to be punished and moved on.

In 1530, during the reign of Henry VIII, a proclamation was issued, describing idleness as the &quot;mother and root of all vices&quot; and ordering that whipping should replace the stocks as the punishment for vagabonds. This change was confirmed in the Vagabonds Act 1530 the following year, with one important change: it directed the justices of the peace to assign to the impotent poor an area within which they were to beg. Generally, the licences to beg for the impotent poor were limited to the disabled, sick, and elderly. An impotent person begging out of his area was to be imprisoned for two days and nights in the stocks, on bread and water, and then sworn to return to the place in which he was authorised to beg. An able-bodied beggar was to be whipped, and sworn to return to the place where he was born, or last dwelt for the space of three years, and there put himself to labour. Still no provision was made, though, for the healthy man simply unable to find work. All able-bodied unemployed were put into the same category. Those unable to find work had a stark choice: starve or break the law. In 1535, a bill was drawn up calling for the creation of a system of public works to deal with the problem of unemployment, to be funded by a tax on income and capital. A law passed a year later allowed vagabonds to be whipped.

In London, there was a great massing of the poor, and the Reformation threatened to eliminate some of the infrastructure used to provide for the poor. As a result, King Henry VIII consented to re-endow St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in 1544 and St. Thomas&#x27; Hospital in 1552 on the condition that the citizens of London pay for their maintenance. However, the city was unable to raise enough revenue from voluntary contributions, so it instituted the first definite compulsory Poor Rate in 1547, which replaced Sunday collections in church with a mandatory collection for the poor. In 1555, London became increasingly concerned with the number of poor who could work, but yet could not find work, so it established the first House of Correction (predecessor to the workhouse) in the King&#x27;s Palace at Bridewell where poor could receive shelter and work at cap-making, feather-bed making, and wire drawing.

For the able-bodied poor, life became even tougher during the reign of Edward VI. The Vagabonds Act 1547 was passed that subjected vagrants to some of the more extreme provisions of the criminal law, namely two years servitude and branding with a &quot;V&quot; as the penalty for the first offence, and death for the second. Justices of the Peace were reluctant to apply the full penalty. In 1552, Edward VI passed the Poor Act 1551 which designated a position of &quot;Collector of Alms&quot; in each parish and created a register of licensed poor. Under the assumption that parish collections would now relieve all poor, begging was completely prohibited.

The government of Elizabeth I, Edward VI&#x27;s successor after Mary I, was also inclined to severity. The Vagabonds Act 1572 called for offenders to be burned through the ear for a first offence, and that persistent beggars should be hanged; however, the Act also made the first clear distinction between the &quot;professional beggar&quot; and those unemployed through no fault of their own. Early in her reign, Elizabeth I also passed laws directly aimed at providing relief for the poor. For example, in 1563, her Act for the Relief of the Poor required all parish residents with ability to contribute to poor collections. Those who &quot;of his or their forward willful mind shall obstinately refuse to give weekly to the relief of the poor according to his or their abilities&quot; could be bound over to justices of the peace and fined £10. Additionally, the 1572 Act further enabled Justices of the Peace to survey and register the impotent poor, determine how much money was required for their relief, and then assess parish residents weekly for the appropriate amount. The Poor Act 1575 required towns to create &quot;a competent stock of wool, hemp, flax, iron and other stuff&quot; for the poor to work on and houses of correction for those who refused to work where recalcitrant or careless workers could be forced to work and punished accordingly.

==== A new colonial solution ====
In the early 1580s, with the development of English colonisation schemes, initially in Ireland and later in North America, a new method to alleviate the condition of the poor would be suggested and utilised considerably over time. Merchant and colonisation proponent George Peckham noted the then-current domestic conditions; &quot;there are at this day great numbers which live in such penurie &amp; want, as they could be content to hazard their lives, and to ser[v]e one yeere for meat, drinke and apparell only, without wages, in hope thereby to amend their estates.&quot; With this, he may have been the first to suggest what became the institution of indentured service. At the same time Richard Hakluyt, in his preface to &quot;Divers Voyages&quot;, likens English planters to &quot;Bees...led out by their Captaines to swarme abroad&quot;; he recommends &quot;deducting&quot; the poor out of the realm. Hakluyt also broadens the scope and additionally recommends to empty the prisons and send them off to the New World. 

By 1619 Virginia&#x27;s system of indentured service would be fully developed, and subsequent colonies would adopt the method with modifications suitable to their different conditions and times. English penal transportation would be implemented soon afterwards, and evolve into a subsidized government endeavour with the Transportation Act 1717.

=== Old Poor Law ===


In 1597, a session of Parliament was called to deal with the issues of increased poverty and vagrancy, among other things. This session culminated in the passage of several Acts referred to as the &quot;Poor Laws of 1598&quot;. Among them were the Poor Relief Act 1597 and the Vagabonds Act 1597. These laws were further refined and formalized by the next session of Parliament, primarily in the Poor Relief Act 1601. Together, these Acts of 1598 and 1601 came to be known as &quot;The Elizabethan Poor Laws.&quot;

The more immediate origins of the Elizabethan Poor Law system were deteriorating economic circumstances in sixteenth-century England. Historian George Boyer has stated that England suffered rapid inflation at this time caused by population growth, the debasement of coinage and the inflow of American silver. Poor harvests in the period between 1595 and 1598 caused the numbers in poverty to increase, while charitable giving had decreased after the dissolution of the monasteries and religious guilds.

The Poor Relief Act 1601 created a system administered at parish level, paid for by levying local rates on rate payers. Relief for those too ill or old to work, the &#x27;impotent poor&#x27;, was in the form of a payment or items of food (&#x27;the parish loaf&#x27;) or clothing also known as outdoor relief. Some aged people might be accommodated in parish alms houses, though these were usually private charitable institutions. Meanwhile, able-bodied beggars who had refused work were often placed in Houses of Correction or even subjected to beatings to mend their attitudes. Provision for the many able-bodied poor in the workhouse was relatively unusual, and most workhouses developed later. The 1601 Law made parents and children responsible for each other, so elderly parents would live with their children.

The Old Poor Law was a parish-based system; there were around 15,000 such parishes based upon the area around a parish church. The system allowed for despotic behaviour from the overseers of the poor, but as they would know their paupers, they were considered able to differentiate between the deserving and undeserving poor, making the system both more humane and initially more efficient. The population was then small enough for everyone to know everyone else&#x27;s circumstances, so the idle poor would be unable to claim on the parishes&#x27; poor rate. The system provided social stability yet by 1750 needed to be adapted to cope with population increases, greater mobility and regional price variations.

The 1601 act sought to deal with &#x27;settled&#x27; poor who had found themselves temporarily out of work—it was assumed they would accept indoor relief or outdoor relief. Neither method was then deemed harsh. The act was intended to deal with beggars who were considered a threat to civil order. The act was passed at a time when poverty was considered necessary as fear of poverty made people work. In 1607 a House of Correction was set up in each county. However, this system was separate from the 1601 system which distinguished between the settled poor and &#x27;vagrants&#x27;. There was much variation in the application of the law and there was a tendency for the destitute to migrate towards the more generous parishes, usually situated in the towns. This led to the Settlement Act 1662 also known as the Poor Relief Act 1662, which allowed relief only to established residents of a parish; mainly through birth, marriage and apprenticeship. Unfortunately, the laws reduced the mobility of labour and discouraged the pauper from leaving his parish to find work. They also encouraged industry to create short contracts (e.g. 364 days) that did not make an employee eligible for poor relief.

A pauper applicant had to prove a settlement. If he could not, he was removed to the parish nearest to his birthplace, or where he prove some connection; some paupers were moved hundreds of miles. Although the parishes he passed through en route had no responsibility for him, they were supposed to supply food and drink and shelter for at least one night. An act of 1697 required beggars to wear a badge of red or blue cloth on the right shoulder with an embroidered letter &quot;P&quot; and the initial of their parish. However, this practice soon fell into disuse.

The workhouse movement began at the end of the 17th century with the establishment of the Bristol Corporation of the Poor, founded by the Bristol Poor Act in 1696. The corporation established a workhouse which combined housing and care of the poor with a house of correction for petty offenders. Following the example of Bristol, some twelve further towns and cities established similar corporations in the next two decades. As these corporations required private acts, they were unsuitable for smaller towns and individual parishes.

Starting with the parish of Olney, Buckinghamshire in 1714 several dozen small towns and individual parishes established their own institutions without any specific legal authorization. These were concentrated in the South Midlands and in the county of Essex. From the late 1710s the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge began to promote the idea of parochial workhouses. The society published several pamphlets on the subject, and supported Sir Edward Knatchbull in his successful efforts to steer the Workhouse Test Act through Parliament in 1723. The act gave legislative authority for the establishment of parochial workhouses, by both single parishes and as joint ventures between two or more parishes. More importantly, the act helped to publicise the idea of establishing workhouses to a national audience. By 1776 some 1,912 parish and corporation workhouses had been established in England and Wales, housing almost 100,000 paupers. Perhaps one million people were receiving some kind of parish poor relief by the end of the century. Although many parishes and pamphlet writers expected to earn money from the labour of the poor in workhouses, the vast majority of people obliged to take up residence in workhouses were ill, elderly, or children whose labour proved largely unprofitable. The demands, needs and expectations of the poor also ensured that workhouses came to take on the character of general social policy institutions, combining the functions of creche, and night shelter, geriatric ward and orphanage. In 1782, Thomas Gilbert finally succeeded in passing the Relief of the Poor Act that established poor houses solely for the aged and infirm and introduced a system of outdoor relief for the able-bodied. This was the basis for the development of the Speenhamland system, which made financial provision for low-paid workers. Settlement Laws were altered by the Poor Removal Act 1795 which prevented non-settled persons from being moved on unless they had applied for relief. An investigation of the history and current state of the Poor Laws was made by Michael Nolan in his 1805 &quot;Treatise of the Laws for the Relief and Settlement of the Poor&quot;. The work would go on to three subsequent editions in Nolan&#x27;s lifetime (Nolan was elected an MP for Barnstaple in 1820), and stoked the discussion both within and outside of Parliament.

During the Napoleonic Wars it became difficult to import cheap grain into Britain which resulted in the price of bread increasing. As wages did not also increase, many agricultural labourers were plunged into poverty. Following peace in 1814, the Tory government of Lord Liverpool passed the Corn Laws to keep the price of grain artificially high. 1815 saw great social unrest as the end of the French Wars saw industrial and agricultural depression and high unemployment. Social attitudes to poverty began to change after 1815 and overhauls of the system were considered. The Poor Law system was criticized as distorting the free market and in 1816 a parliamentary select committee looked into altering the system which resulted in the Sturges-Bourne&#x27;s Act being passed. 1817 also saw the passing of the Public Works Loans Act 1817 (57 Geo. 3. c. 34), &quot;to authorise the issue of Exchequer Bills and the Advance of Money out of the Consolidated Fund, to a limited Amount, for the carrying on of Public Works and Fisheries in the United Kingdom and Employment of the Poor in Great Britain&quot;. By 1820, before the passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 workhouses were already being built to reduce the spiralling cost of poor relief. Boyer suggests several possible reasons for the gradual increase in relief given to able-bodied males, including the enclosure movement and a decline in industries such as wool spinning and lace making. Boyer also contends that farmers were able to take advantage of the poor law system to shift some of their labour costs onto the tax payer.

=== The Royal Commission on the Poor Law ===


The 1832 Royal Commission into the Operation of the Poor Laws was set up following the widespread destruction and machine breaking of the Swing Riots. The report was prepared by a commission of nine, including Nassau William Senior, and served by Edwin Chadwick as Secretary. The royal commission&#x27;s primary concerns were with illegitimacy (or &quot;bastardy&quot;), reflecting the influence of Malthusians, and the fear that the practices of the Old Poor Law were undermining the position of the independent labourer. Two practices were of particular concern: the &quot;roundsman&quot; system, where overseers hired out paupers as cheap labour, and the Speenhamland system, which subsidised low wages without relief. The report concluded that the existing Poor Laws undermined the prosperity of the country by interfering with the natural laws of supply and demand, that the existing means of poor relief allowed employers to force down wages, and, that poverty itself was inevitable.

The commission proposed the New Law be governed by two overarching principles:

When the act was introduced however it had been partly watered down. The workhouse test and the idea of &quot;less eligibility&quot; were never mentioned themselves and the recommendation of the royal commission that outdoor relief (relief given outside of a workhouse) should be abolished – was never implemented. The report recommended separate workhouses for the aged, infirm, children, able-bodied females and able-bodied males. The report also stated that parishes should be grouped into unions in order to spread the cost of workhouses and a central authority should be established in order to enforce these measures. The Poor Law Commission set up by Earl Grey took a year to write its report, the recommendations passed easily through Parliament support by both main parties the Whigs and the Tories. The bill gained royal assent in 1834. The few who opposed the bill were more concerned about the centralisation which it would bring rather than the underpinning philosophy of utilitarianism.

=== New Poor Law ===

The Poor Law Amendment Act was passed in 1834 by the government of Lord Melbourne and largely implemented the findings of the royal commission which had presented its findings two years earlier. The New Poor Law is considered to be one of the most &quot;far-reaching pieces of legislation of the entire Nineteenth Century&quot; and &quot;classic example of the fundamental Whig–Benthamite reforming legislation of the period&quot;. The act aimed to reduce the burden on rate payers and can be seen as an attempt by the Whig government to win the votes of the classes enfranchised by the Great Reform Act. Despite being labelled an &quot;amendment act&quot; it completely overhauled the existing system and established a Poor Law Commission to oversee the national operation of the system. This included the forming together of small parishes into poor law unions and the building of workhouses in each union for the giving of poor relief. Although the legislation sought to reduce costs to rate payers, one area not reformed was the system&#x27;s continued financing via &quot;poor rates&quot; on property owners.

Although the Poor Law Amendment Act did not ban all forms of outdoor relief, it stated that no able-bodied person was to receive money or other help from the Poor Law authorities except in a workhouse. Conditions in workhouses were to be made harsh to discourage people from claiming. Workhouses were to be built in every parish, or in poor law unions. The Poor Law Commissioners were to be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the act.

Various reasons prevented the application of some of the act&#x27;s terms. Less eligibility was in some cases impossible without starving paupers, and the high cost of building workhouses incurred by rate payers meant that outdoor relief continued to be a popular alternative. Despite efforts to ban outdoor relief, parishes continued to offer it as a more cost-effective method of dealing with pauperism. The Outdoor Labour Test Order and Outdoor Relief Prohibitory Order were both issued to try to prevent people receiving relief outside of the workhouse.

When the new amendment was applied to the industrial North of England (an area the law had never considered during reviews), the system failed catastrophically as many found themselves temporarily unemployed, due to recessions or a fall in stock demands (so-called &#x27;cyclical unemployment&#x27;) and were reluctant to enter a workhouse, despite its being the only method of gaining aid. Nottingham also was allowed an exemption from the law and continued to provide outdoor relief.

The abuses and shortcomings of the system are documented in the novels of Charles Dickens and Frances Trollope and later in &quot;The People of the Abyss&quot; by Jack London. Despite the aspirations of the reformers, the New Poor Law was unable to make the Workhouse as bad as life outside. The primary problem was that in order to make the diet of the workhouse inmates &quot;less eligible&quot; than what they could expect outside, it would be necessary to starve the inmates beyond an acceptable level. It was for this reason that other ways were found to deter entrance to the workhouses. These measures ranged from the introduction of prison-style uniforms to the segregation of inmates into separate yards for men, women, boys, and girls.

In 1846, the Andover workhouse scandal, where conditions in the Andover Union workhouse were found to be inhumane and dangerous, prompted a government review and the replacement of the Poor Law Commission with a Poor Law Board. Now, a committee of Parliament was to administer the Poor Law, with a cabinet minister as head. Despite this another scandal occurred over inhumane treatment of paupers in the Huddersfield workhouse.

=== After the New Poor Law ===


After 1847 the Poor Law Commission was replaced with a Poor Law Board. This was because of the Andover workhouse scandal and the criticism of Henry Parker who was responsible for the Andover union as well as the tensions in Somerset House caused by Chadwick&#x27;s failure to become a Poor Law Commissioner. The Poor Law had been altered in 1834 because of increasing costs. The Workhouse Visiting Society which formed in 1858 highlighted conditions in workhouses and led to workhouses being inspected more often. The Union Chargeability Act 1865 was passed in order to make the financial burden of pauperism be placed upon the whole unions rather than individual parishes. Most boards of guardians were middle class and committed to keeping poor rates as low as possible. After the Reform Act 1867 there was increasing welfare legislation. As this legislation required local authorities&#x27; support the Poor Law Board was replaced with a Local Government Board in 1871. The Local Government Board led a crusade against outdoor relief supported by the Charity Organisation Society, an organization which viewed outdoor relief as destroying the self-reliance of the poor. The effect of this renewed effort to deter outdoor relief was to reduce claimants by a third and to increase numbers in the work house by 12–15%. County councils were formed in 1888, and district councils in 1894. This meant that public housing, unlike health and income maintenance, developed outside the scope of the Poor Law. Poor Law policy after the New Poor Law concerning the elderly, the sick and mentally ill and children became more humane. This was in part due to the expense of providing &quot;mixed workhouses&quot; as well as changing attitudes regarding the causes and nature of poverty.

=== Decline and abolition ===


The Poor Law system began to decline with the availability of other forms of assistance. The growth of friendly societies provided help for its members without recourse to the Poor Law system. Some trade unions also provided help for their members. The Medical Relief Disqualification Removal Act 1885 meant that people who had accessed medical care funded by the poor rate were no longer disqualified from voting in elections. In 1886 the Chamberlain Circular encouraged the Local Government Board to set up work projects when unemployment rates were high rather than use workhouses. The Conservatives passed the Unemployed Workmen Act 1905 which provided for temporary employment for workers in times of unemployment.

In 1905 a royal commission was set up to investigate what changes could be made to the Poor Law. The commission produced two conflicting reports but both investigations were largely ignored by the Liberal government when implementing their own scheme of welfare legislation. The welfare reforms of the Liberal government made several provisions to provide social services without the stigma of the Poor Law, including old age pensions and National Insurance, and from that period fewer people were covered by the system. From 1911, the term &quot;workhouse&quot; was replaced by &quot;Poor Law Institution&quot;. Means tests were developed during the inter-war period, not as part of the Poor Law, but as part of the attempt to offer relief that was not affected by the stigma of pauperism. According to Lees by slowly dismantling the system the Poor Law was &quot;to die by attrition and surgical removals of essential organs&quot;.

During the First World War there is evidence that some workhouses were used as makeshift hospitals for wounded servicemen. Numbers using the Poor Law system increased during the interwar years and between 1921 and 1938 despite the extension of unemployment insurance to virtually all workers except the self-employed. Many of these workers were provided with outdoor relief. One aspect of the Poor Law that continued to cause resentment was that the burden of poor relief was not shared equally by rich and poor areas but, rather, fell most heavily on those areas in which poverty was at its worst. This was a central issue in the Poplar Rates Rebellion led by George Lansbury and others in 1921. Lansbury had in 1911 written a provocative attack on the workhouse system in a pamphlet entitled &quot;Smash Up the Workhouse!&quot;.

Poverty in the interwar years (1918–1939) was responsible for several measures which largely killed off the Poor Law system. The Board of Guardians (Default) Act 1926 was passed in response to some Boards of Guardians supporting the miners during the General Strike. Workhouses were officially abolished by the Local Government Act 1929, and between 1929 and 1930 Poor Law Guardians, the &quot;workhouse test&quot; and the term &quot;pauper&quot; disappeared. The Unemployment Assistance Board was set up in 1934 to deal with those not covered by the earlier National Insurance Act 1911 passed by the Liberals, and by 1937 the able-bodied poor had been absorbed into this scheme. By 1936 only 13% of people were still receiving poor relief in some form of institution.

In 1948 the Poor Law system was finally abolished with the introduction of the modern welfare state and the passing of the National Assistance Act. The National Health Service Act 1946 came into force in 1948 and created the modern day National Health Service.

== Opposition ==


Opposition to the Poor Law grew at the beginning of the 19th century. The 1601 system was felt to be too costly and was considered in academic circles as encouraging the underlying problems. Jeremy Bentham argued for a disciplinary, punitive approach to social problems, whilst the writings of Thomas Malthus focused attention on overpopulation, and the growth of illegitimacy. David Ricardo argued that there was an &quot;iron law of wages&quot;. The effect of poor relief, in the view of the reformers, was to undermine the position of the &quot;independent labourer&quot;.

In the period following the Napoleonic Wars, several reformers altered the function of the &quot;poorhouse&quot; into the model for a deterrent workhouse. The first of the deterrent workhouses in this period was at Bingham, Nottinghamshire. The second was Becher&#x27;s workhouse in Southwell, now maintained by the National Trust. George Nicholls, the overseer at Southwell, was to become a Poor Law Commissioner in the reformed system. The 1817 Report of the Select Committee on the Poor Laws condemned the Poor Law as causing poverty itself.

The introduction of the New Poor Law also resulted in opposition. Some who gave evidence to the Royal Commission into the Operation of the Poor Laws suggested that the existing system had proved adequate and was more adaptable to local needs. This argument was strongest in the industrial North of England and in the textile industries where outdoor relief was a more effective method of dealing with cyclical unemployment as well as being a more cost-effective method. Poor Law commissioners faced greatest opposition in Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire where in 1837 there was high unemployment during an economic depression. The New Poor Law was seen as interference from Londoners with little understanding of local affairs. Opposition was unusually strong because committees had already been formed in opposition to the Ten Hours Movement, leaders of the Ten Hours campaign such as Richard Oastler, Joseph Rayner Stephens and John Fielden became the leaders of the Anti-Poor Law campaign. The &quot;Book of Murder&quot; was published and was aimed at creating opposition to the workhouse system. and pamphlets were published spreading rumour and propaganda about Poor Law Commissioners and alleged infanticide inside of workhouses. Opposition to the Poor Law yielded some successes in delaying the development of workhouses, and one workhouse in Stockport was attacked by a crowd of rioters. As many Boards of Guardians were determined to continue under the old system, the Poor Law Commission granted some boards the right to continue providing relief under the Old Poor Law. However, the movement against the New Poor Law was short-lived, leading many to instead turn towards Chartism.

== Scotland and Ireland ==

The Poor Law systems of Scotland and Ireland were distinct from the English Poor Law system covering England and Wales although Irish legislation was heavily influenced by the English Poor Law Amendment Act 1834. In Scotland the Poor Law system was reformed by the Poor Law (Scotland) Act 1845. In Ireland the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act 1838 was the first attempt to put control of the destitute and responsibility for their welfare on a statutory basis. Due to exceptional overcrowding, workhouses in Ireland stopped admissions during the Irish famine and increasingly resorted to outdoor relief. Emigration was sometimes used by landlords as a method of keeping the cost of poor relief down and removing surplus labour. Reforms after the Irish War of Independence resulted in the abolition of Boards of Guardians in the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State and their replacement by County Boards of Health.

== Historiography ==

The historiography of the Poor Laws has passed through several distinct phases. The &quot;traditionalist&quot; or &quot;orthodox&quot; account of the Poor Laws focuses upon the deficiencies of the Old Poor Law. This early historiography was influential in successfully overhauling the system. Mark Blaug presents the first revisionist analysis of the Poor Law in &quot;The Myth of the Old Poor Law and the making of the New&quot;, commenting that the Old Poor Law did not reduce the efficiency of agricultural workers, lower wages, depress rents or compound the burden on rate payers. Blaug argues that Old Poor Law was a device &quot;for dealing with the problems of structural unemployment and substandard wages in the lagging rural sector of a rapidly growing but still underdeveloped economy&quot;. Other areas of Poor Law which have concerned historians include the extent to which the Second Great Reform Act contributed to the Poor Law Amendment Act and the extent to which outdoor relief was abolished following the New Poor Law.

<text>The Speenhamland system was a form of outdoor relief intended to mitigate rural poverty in England and Wales at the end of the 18th century and during the early 19th century. The law was an amendment to the Elizabethan Poor Law (the Poor Relief Act 1601). It was created as an indirect result of Britain&#x27;s involvements in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1793–1815).

==Operation==
The system was named after a 1795 meeting in Speenhamland, Berkshire, where local magistrates devised the system as a means to alleviate the distress caused by high grain prices. The increase in the price of grain may have occurred as a result of a poor harvest in the years 1795–96, though at the time this was subject to great debate. Many blamed middlemen and hoarders as the ultimate architects of the shortage.

The Speenhamland scale read, &quot;When a gallon loaf of bread cost one shilling:... every Poor and Industrious Man should have for his own Support 3s weekly, either produced by his Family&#x27;s Labour, or an Allowance from the Poor rates, and for the support of wife and every other of his Family 1s 6d... When the Gallon loaf shall cost 1s 4d then every Poor and Industrious Man shall have 4s Weekly for his own, and 1s and 10d for the Support of every other of his Family. And so on in proportion as the price of bread rises and falls.&quot;

The authorities at Speenhamland approved a means-tested sliding-scale of wage supplements in order to mitigate the worst effects of rural poverty. Families were paid extra to top up wages to a set level according to a table. This level varied according to the number of children and the price of bread. For example, if bread was 1s 2d (14 pence) a loaf, the wages of a family with two children were topped up to 8s 6d (102 pence).

The first formula was set at a time of high prices and possible over-charging, minimum wage inflation was deliberately muted compared to price rises. If bread rose to 1s 8d (20 pence) the wages were topped up to 11s 0d (132 pence). In this quoted example in percentage terms, a 43% price rise led to a 30% wage rise (wages fell from 7.3 to 6.6 loaves).

The immediate impact of paying the poor rate fell on the landowners of the parish concerned. They then sought other means of dealing with the poor, such as the workhouse funded through parish unions. Eventually pressure due to structural poverty caused the introduction of the new Poor Law (1834).

The Speenhamland system appears to have reached its height during the Napoleonic Wars, when it was a means of allaying dangerous discontent among growing numbers of rural poor faced by soaring food prices, and to have died out in the post-war period, except in a few parishes. The system was popular in the south of England. William Pitt the Younger attempted to get the idea passed into legislation but failed. The system was not adopted nationally but was popular in the counties which experienced the Swing Riots during the 1830s.

==Criticisms==
In 1834, the Report of the Royal Commission into the Operation of the Poor Laws 1832 called the Speenhamland System a &quot;universal system of pauperism&quot;. The system allowed employers, including farmers and the nascent industrialists of the town, to pay below subsistence wages, because the parish would make up the difference and keep their workers alive. So the workers&#x27; low income was unchanged and the poor rate contributors subsidised the farmers.

Thomas Malthus believed a system of supporting the poor would lead to increased population growth rates because the Poor Laws encouraged early marriage and prolific procreation, which would be a problem due to the Malthusian catastrophe (where population growth would exceed food production). More recent scholarly analysis of census data by E. A. Wrigley, and Richard Smith shows that Malthus was mistaken.

Historian Rutger Bregman argues that food production actually grew steadily by a third between 1790 and 1830, though with a smaller section of the populace able to access it due to mechanization, and the population growth that actually happened was due to growing demand for child labour and not Speenhamland.

David Ricardo believed that Speenhamland would create a poverty trap, where the poor would work less, which would make food production fall, in its turn creating the space for a revolution;. However, Bregman argues the poverty that existed back then was not caused by a supposed Speenhamland &quot;poverty trap&quot;, as &quot;wage earners were permitted to keep at least part of their allowances when their earnings increased&quot;, but instead was the result of price hikes resulting from England returning to the gold standard, a policy Ricardo himself had recommended.

While some scholars believe that social unrest resulted from the system, others believe it was due to the adoption of the gold standard and industrialization, which equally affected all the populace in areas with or without Speenhamland.

This system of poor relief, and others like it, lasted until the passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which prohibited boards of guardians supplementing the wages of full-time workers. This was not always implemented locally as guardians did not want to separate families in workhouses, and it was often cheaper to supplement wages than operate larger workhouses.

Evidence in the last 30 years shows that the bread scale devised during the Speenhamland meeting in 1795 was by no means universal, and that even the system of outdoor relief which found one of its earliest, though not its first, expressions in Speenhamland was not completely widespread. Allowances or supplements to wages were used generally as a temporary measure and the way they operated differed between regions. Mark Blaug&#x27;s 1960 essay &quot;The Myth of the Old Poor Law&quot; charged the commissioners of 1834 with largely using the Speenhamland system to vilify the old poor law and create a will for the passage of a new one. However, historians such as Eric Hobsbawm have argued that the old poor law was still damaging by subsidising employers, and heightening dependency of workers&#x27; incomes on local aristocrats.

Daniel A. Baugh argues that relief costs did not greatly increase. After the Napoleonic Wars the conditions of employment and subsistence in south-east England underwent a fundamental change. The Speenhamland System did not differ much in consequences from the older system; what mattered was the shape of the poverty problem.
