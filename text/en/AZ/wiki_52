<text>Magenta (, ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the Metropolitan City of Milan in Lombardy, northern Italy. It became notable as the site of the Battle of Magenta in 1859. The color magenta takes its name from the battle. 

Magenta is the birthplace of Saint Gianna Beretta Molla (1922–1962) and film producer Carlo Ponti (1912–2007).
The municipality of Magenta is part of the Parco naturale lombardo della Valle del Ticino, a Nature reserve included by UNESCO in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves.

== History ==

Magenta was probably a settlement of the Insubres, a Celtic tribe, who founded it around the 5th century BC. The area was conquered by the Romans in 222 BC. The name is traditionally connected to &quot;castrum Maxentiae&quot;, meaning &quot;castle of Maxentius&quot;. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it was ruled by the Lombards. The Celtic origins of Magenta are proved by some important archeological finds, especially in the area where now the Institute of Canossian Mothers stands; there was a Celtic necropolis in ancient times. Objects, jewelry and weapons were found here.

In the Middle Ages, it was destroyed twice, in 1162 by Frederick Barbarossa and in 1356 by the troops opposing the Visconti rule of Milan. In 1310, according to a legend, the emperor Henry VII was stopped here by a snowstorm during his march to Milan. In 1398 Gian Galeazzo Visconti donated the town territories to the monks of the Certosa di Pavia.

On June 4, 1859, it was the site of an important battle of the Second War of Italian Independence. The Franco-Piedmontese victory in the fight gave them the chance to conquer Austrian Lombardy.

Magenta received the honorary title of city with a presidential decree on May 25, 1947.

<text>Epsilon Indi, Latinized from ε Indi, is a star system located at a distance of approximately 12 light-years from Earth in the southern constellation of Indus. The star has an orange hue and is faintly visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.674. It consists of a K-type main-sequence star, ε Indi A, and two brown dwarfs, ε Indi Ba and ε Indi Bb, in a wide orbit around it. The brown dwarfs were discovered in 2003. ε Indi Ba is an early T dwarf (T1) and ε Indi Bb a late T dwarf (T6) separated by 0.6 arcseconds, with a projected distance of 1460 AU from their primary star.

ε Indi A has one known planet, ε Indi Ab, with a mass of 6.31 Jupiter masses in an elliptical orbit with a period of about 171.3 years. ε Indi Ab is the second-closest Jovian exoplanet, after ε Eridani b. The ε Indi system provides a benchmark case for the study of the formation of gas giants and brown dwarfs.

==Observation==

The constellation Indus (the Indian) first appeared in Johann Bayer&#x27;s celestial atlas &quot;Uranometria&quot; in 1603. The 1801 star atlas &quot;Uranographia&quot;, by German astronomer Johann Elert Bode, places ε Indi as one of the arrows being held in the left hand of the Indian.

In 1847, Heinrich Louis d&#x27;Arrest compared the position of this star in several catalogues dating back to 1750, and discovered that it possessed a measureable proper motion. That is, he found that the star had changed position across the celestial sphere over time. In 1882–3, the parallax of ε Indi was measured by astronomers David Gill and William L. Elkin at the Cape of Good Hope. They derived a parallax estimate of arcseconds. In 1923, Harlow Shapley of the Harvard Observatory derived a parallax of 0.45 arcseconds.

In 1972, the Copernicus satellite was used to examine this star for the emission of ultraviolet laser signals. Again, the result was negative. ε Indi leads a list, compiled by Margaret Turnbull and Jill Tarter of the Carnegie Institution in Washington, of 17,129 nearby stars most likely to have planets that could support complex life.

The star is among five nearby paradigms as K-type stars of a type in a &#x27;sweet spot&#x27; between Sun-analog stars and M stars for the likelihood of evolved life, per analysis of Giada Arney from NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center.

==Characteristics==

ε Indi A is a main-sequence star of spectral type K5V. The star has only about three-fourths the mass of the Sun and 71% of the Sun&#x27;s radius. Its surface gravity is slightly higher than the Sun&#x27;s. The metallicity of a star is the proportion of elements with higher atomic numbers than helium, being typically represented by the ratio of iron to hydrogen compared to the same ratio for the Sun; ε Indi A is found to have about 87% of the Sun&#x27;s proportion of iron in its photosphere.

The corona of ε Indi A is similar to the Sun, with an X-ray luminosity of 2 ergs s−1 (2 W) and an estimated coronal temperature of 2 K. The stellar wind of this star expands outward, producing a bow shock at a distance of 63 AU. Downstream of the bow, the termination shock reaches as far as 140 AU from the star.
This star has the third highest proper motion of any star visible to the unaided eye, after Groombridge 1830 and 61 Cygni, and the ninth highest overall. This motion will move the star into the constellation Tucana around 2640 AD. ε Indi A has a space velocity relative to the Sun of 86 km/s, which is unusually high for what is considered a young star. It is thought to be a member of the ε Indi moving group of at least sixteen population I stars. This is an association of stars that have similar space velocity vectors, and therefore most likely formed at the same time and location. ε Indi will make its closest approach to the Sun in about 17,500 years when it makes perihelion passage at a distance of around .

As seen from ε Indi, the Sun is a 2.6-magnitude star in Ursa Major, near the bowl of the Big Dipper.
==Brown dwarfs==
In January 2003, astronomers announced the discovery of a brown dwarf with a mass of 40 to 60 Jupiter masses in orbit around ε Indi A with a projected separation on the sky of about 1,500 AU. In August 2003, astronomers discovered that this brown dwarf was actually a binary brown dwarf, with an apparent separation of 2.1 AU and an orbital period of about 15 years. Both brown dwarfs are of spectral class T; the more massive component, ε Indi Ba, is of spectral type T1–T1.5 and the less massive component, ε Indi Bb, of spectral type T6. More recent parallax measurements with the Gaia spacecraft place the ε Indi B binary about 11,600 AU (0.183 lightyears) away from ε Indi A, along line of sight from Earth.

Evolutionary models have been used to estimate the physical properties of these brown dwarfs from spectroscopic and photometric measurements. These yield masses of and times the mass of Jupiter, and radii of and solar radii, for ε Indi Ba and ε Indi Bb, respectively. The effective temperatures are 1300–1340 K and 880–940 K, while the log &quot;g&quot; (cm s−1) surface gravities are 5.50 and 5.25, and their luminosities are and the luminosity of the Sun. They have an estimated metallicity of [M/H] = –0.2.

==Planetary system==
 


The existence of a planetary companion to Epsilon Indi A was suspected since 2002 based on radial velocity observations. The planet Epsilon Indi Ab was confirmed in 2018 and formally published in 2019 along with its detection via astrometry.

A direct imaging attempt of this planet using the James Webb Space Telescope was performed in 2023, and the image was released in 2024. The detected planet&#x27;s mass and orbit are different from what was predicted based on radial velocity and astrometry observations. It has a mass of 6.31 Jupiter masses and an elliptical orbit with a period of about 171.3 years.

No excess infrared radiation that would indicate a debris disk has been detected around ε Indi. Such a debris disk could be formed from the collisions of planetesimals that survive from the early period of the star&#x27;s protoplanetary disk.

<doc id="205703" wikidata="Q1390614" url="?curid=205703" title="Eero Järnefelt">
<text>Erik &quot;Eero&quot; Nikolai Järnefelt (8 November 1863 – 15 November 1937) was a Finnish painter and art professor. He is best known for his portraits and landscapes of the area around Koli National Park, in the North Karelia region of Finland. He was a medal winner at the Paris &quot;Exposition Universelle&quot; of 1889 and 1900, taught art at the University of Helsinki and was chairman of the Finnish Academy of Fine Arts.

==Biography==
He was the son of General Alexander Järnefelt and Baroness Elisabeth Järnefelt (née Clodt von Jürgensburg). He came from a Swedish-speaking Finnophile family of artists, writers and composers descended from the Baltic aristocracy. Several of his eight siblings also became well-known: (a literary critic), Arvid (a judge and writer), Armas (a composer and conductor) and Aino (wife of Jean Sibelius).

After graduating from a private academy, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Helsinki from 1874 to 1878, the Imperial Academy of Arts from 1883 to 1886 (where one of his teachers was his uncle, Mikhail Clodt), and the Académie Julian in Paris from 1886 to 1888, where he studied with Tony Robert-Fleury. A major influence was the Naturalism of Jules Bastien-Lepage.


In 1889, he married the actress . In 1892, he made his first trip to the area around Koli with Juhani Aho and his wife, the painter Venny Soldan-Brofeldt. He was impressed with the scenery there and would continue to visit regularly until 1936. 

In 1893, he traveled to Finland where he sketched and photographed agricultural workers which inspired his most famous painting, &quot;Under the Yoke (Burning the Brushwood)&quot;. Later, he made several study trips; to Italy in 1894 and Crimea in 1899. That same year, he helped organize an international exhibition in Saint Petersburg, sponsored by &quot;Mir Iskusstva&quot;.

In 1901, he built a home that he named &quot;Suviranta&quot; (Summer Beach) at the artists&#x27; colony near Lake Tuusula, designed by Usko Nyström. He lived there only until 1917 when he moved to Helsinki, but it is still owned and used by his family.

From 1902 to 1928, he taught drawing at the University of Helsinki. He was appointed professor there in 1912 and served as chairman of the Finnish Academy of Fine Arts. His last major work was an altarpiece for the church in Raahe, which he completed in 1926. A major retrospective was held in 2013, which included several previously unknown works.

<text>Samawah or As-Samawah () is a city in Iraq, 280 kilometres (174 mi) southeast of Baghdad.

The city of Samawah is the modern capital of the Al Muthanna Governorate. The city is located midway between Baghdad and Basra, at the northern edge of the governorate. The province was established in 1975; prior to that date it was a unified province along with Qadissiya (Diwaniya) and Najaf. 

==History and attractions==

=== Early history ===

The city was settled by the Arab tribe of Banu Quda&#x27;a around the 3rd century AD. It is built on both sides of the Euphrates river; there are four bridges in the centre of town for crossing between the two sides. The west bank of the city contains the commercial heart of the city, and includes the old town and the Jewish quarter, &quot;agd al yahood&quot;. The west bank is the site of the covered market &quot;Suq Al Masgoof&quot;, which dates to the Ottoman period. The area surrounding the market is the old city with its Byzantine maze of crowded markets and streets.
The most famous attraction of Samawah is the ruins of the ancient Sumerian city of Uruk which dates to 4000 BC. This was the largest city in Sumer, extending over 2 km2. Uruk was not only the largest conurbation of the first urban civilisation on earth, but it is also the place where the first written script was discovered, the oldest dating back to 3300 BC.

Samawah is built on both sides of the Euphrates and is surrounded by hundreds of palm groves that give it a tropical feel, especially in the southern and northern suburbs. These groves provide cool respite from the scorching heat of Mesopotamia and were the inspiration for the famous Iraqi folk song &quot;The Palm of Samawah&quot;.
Samawah has a large salt lake called Sawa Lake, which once had a tourist village that has since fallen into disrepair. The lake is located 25 km (15 mi) to the north of the city centre and is accessible by road. The lake has no obvious source, neither river nor ancient link to a sea. The water is extremely salty due to heavy evaporation in the searing heat of Mesopotamia and supports no marine life. A unique feature of the lake is that the water is above ground level surrounded by natural levees. Due to the high levels of salt in the lake, the levees heal themselves if a break is made in the levee, stopping the water from flowing down to ground level. The salt levels also improve buoyancy, and many migratory birds walk on the lake.

=== Modern history ===
The eastern side of the city including &quot;Qushla&quot; has a more modern feel and contains a number of estates of apartment blocks built during the 1970s and 1980s, As Samawah Stadium, which is home to the local Muthanna football team Samawa FC, as well as technical colleges and the polytechnic. There too is &quot;Al Qushla&quot;, the historic &quot;Ottoman Barracks&quot;.
Al Muthanna province contains one of the most notorious prisons in Iraq, which has been used since the time of the monarchy (1921–1958). &quot;Nigret Al Salman&quot;, located in the small town of Al-Salman 200 km (124 mi) south of Samawah, is a desert prison camp built in the style of a fortress where thousands have perished over the decades. It was used to house the prisoners surviving the Dujail Massacre. During the Anfal campaign directed at Kurds, older men and women were sent to the prison as well.
The &quot;Saray&quot; on the east bank of Samawah is the historical seat of authority and authoritarianism in Samawah. It dates from the period of the Ottoman rule. It has been the focus of revolts and popular uprisings by the local population for the past century, most recently in 1991 when hundreds of prisoners, including women and children, as well as Kuwaiti hostages kidnapped by the Iraqi occupation forces in 1990, were freed from their captors by the people of Samawah. 
Samawah&#x27;s medical facilities have improved greatly since 2003. The renovation of the central hospital with the aid of Japanese development funds has resulted in an improvement in medical provision for the residents of the province. New facilities, such as an MRI scanner, have been added to the existing medical units.

The residents of Samawah have used some simple and low-cost means to brighten up the appearance of the grey concrete walls surrounding official buildings and schion was started in the early 1970s, but was cut off during the period of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s rule (1979–2003). The wall paintings put up since 2003 depict the new life achieved since the liberation.

=== Post-Saddam era: ===

Since the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, the town has had the fewest problems with Coalition forces, with insurgent activity practically non-existent.
Elements of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division and 1–41 Infantry, 1st Armored Division, took the town in the Battle of Samawah, a fierce running battle with emplaced Baathist forces in the days after the initial invasion. After the initial combat phase ended in May 2003, the 82nd was relieved by U.S. Marines from RCT-5, 1st Marine Division. Control of the city was handed over to Dutch forces in August 2003, to the British Army (1st The Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards) in October 2004 who in turn handed over to (The Light Dragoons) again British Army Cavalry Regiment in April 2005 and in October 2005 the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment took over. All units took part in peacekeeping operations involving foot and vehicular patrols winning hearts and minds also they helped in training local police in crowd control and riot training, also fire arms training.

Japan Self-Defense Forces, stationed in Samawah since January 2004, left in 2006. British and Australian troops departed, making Samawah&#x27;s entire province the first to be responsible for its own security, dubbed in Iraqi parlance the first &quot;green province&quot;, meaning that it is fully independent.

On December 24, 2006, political violence between Shiite militias hit Samawah, killing 9 people, among them 4 policemen. Reportedly, local members of the Mahdi Army tried to seize the city in a failed attempt and clashed with the police, who were aided by the Badr Organization. Internal fighting and division among the local tribes was reported. Associates of Mahdi leader Muqtada al-Sadr said he was distancing himself from the Samawah militia, led by &quot;a renegade cleric&quot;.

On May 1, 2016, a government office and bus station in the city of Samawah were attacked in a double car bombing claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The attack killed at least 32 people and wounded another 85.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Samawah has a hot desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot;) in the Köppen–Geiger climate classification system. Most rain falls in the winter. The average annual temperature in Samawah is . About of precipitation falls annually.

==Religion==
Primarily Shiite, the town was cut off almost entirely by Saddam Hussein during the 1991 Iraqi uprisings after the Gulf War. The terrorisation of the Jewish minority by Arab nationalists in the 1940s and &#x27;50s drove most of them into exile. The Torat Synagogue, which has been abandoned since the flight of the Jews, still exists in the &quot;qushla&quot; quarter of the east bank of Samawah. 
In 1979–81 an ethnic cleansing campaign saw Shia Iraqis deemed to be of Persian origin deported by the Baathist regime of Saddam Hussein.

Today, there is still a small population of Sunnis in the city.

==Economy==
The unemployment rate is high.
The city, in spite of the lack of high-value natural resources such as oil and gas and a lack of central government investment, has managed to maintain lively small-scale industrial, agricultural and alternative sectors.

Samawah had the largest cement factories in the Middle East during the 1970s, with a total production capacity of 2.85 million tonnes a year. These have since fallen into disrepair, exacerbating the unemployment situation, although the southern cement factory, the oldest, reopened in 2005. As of 2007, the four existing plants are producing a total of just 0.8 million tonnes a year due to the shortage of electricity. Five new cement factories with a capacity of 9 million tonnes a year are under construction on the outskirts of Samawah and will provide employment for several thousand skilled and unskilled workers as well as filling 45% of Iraq&#x27;s total cement needs.

A small oil refinery was reopened in Samawah in 2005 after being idle for 15 years. The existing 10,000 bbl/d facility&#x27;s capacity was doubled to in 2006 and was to have increased to by 2007. The facility is linked by pipeline to the new Kifl oil field in Samawah province that has an initial capacity of . The major advantage of the refinery is that it is designed for processing heavy crude oil, allowing the light crude to be exported.

The historical route between Mesopotamia and Saudi Arabia ran through Samawah, and it has been a main trading thoroughfare for Iraqi produce to Saudi Arabia.
Samawah is home to a rail yard for overhauling and maintaining the rolling stock and locomotives along the Baghdad-Basra rail routes. Samawah railway station is conveniently located halfway between Baghdad and Basra. Overhaul facilities for the railways are an important source of employment opportunities in this Mesopotamian city. 
There was an overhaul facility for the Iraqi Armoured corps based in Samawah belonging to the military Industrial Commission.

In terms of agriculture, the staple Mesopotamian produce is grown in Samawah, such as dates, wheat, barley, citrus fruits, and tomatoes. In addition, Samawah is home to the small and rare trade in wild truffles, which grow in the desert regions of Muthanna province.

The &quot;Bahr al Milh&quot;, or Salt Sea, located 20 km (12 mi) to the southwest of Samawah, is the main source of industrial salts in Iraq, and large salt mining and processing facilities are located there to exploit this resource. 

A thriving industry in traditional sun-baked brick manufacture exists on the outskirts of Samawah using primarily female labourers for forming and drying bricks. Large temporary kilns with chimney stacks as high as 30 m (98 ft) are constructed by villagers in the surrounding region to make baked bricks with the same methods used during the Sumerian and Akkadian periods.

Samawah has its own media industry, with the recently reopened Muthanna TV broadcasting terrestrial transmission to Samawah and the province. It focuses primarily on local news and issues. The station gained notoriety as the &quot;Robin Hood of Television&quot; when it broadcast the 2006 World Cup games without licence using a single subscription to a pay-per-view satellite channel. The central government were unable to enforce a ruling against the TV station to stop the transmissions.

There is a small cottage industry of carpet makers in the city, primarily employing women. The advantages for the local carpet makers are the availability of cheap raw materials, wool from the desert Bedu who use Samawah as their main trading post, and the availability of cheap labour in this poor city.

==Reaching Samawah==

Samawah is served by a highway for road traffic from Baghdad and Basra. The railway station has passenger services from both Baghdad and Basra and is the cheapest form of transport. The railway station is located approximately 4 kilometers (2.5 mi) to the west of central Samawah.

Samawah is also accessible via the Euphrates River.

==Samawah artists and personalities==

A number of prominent artists originate from Samawah, including poets, painters and sculptors. An indepth overview of both historical and current artists can be found in samawah artists.

Due to the preponderance of both communists as well as Shia thinkers like (Sheikh Mahdi Al-Samawi) was among the personalities and artists of Samawah, most of them ended up either being killed by the Baathists regime or lived in exile for much of their lives.

<text>Tara Kristen Lipinski (born June 10, 1982) is an American former competitive figure skater, actress, sports commentator, and documentary film producer. A former competitor in women&#x27;s singles, she is the 1998 Olympic champion, the 1997 World champion, a two-time Champions Series Final champion (1997–1998) and the 1997 U.S. national champion. Until 2019, she was the youngest single skater to win a U.S. Nationals and the youngest to become an Olympic and World champion in figure skating history. She is the first woman to complete a triple loop-triple loop combination, her signature jump element, in competition. Starting in 1997, Lipinski had a rivalry with fellow skater Michelle Kwan, which was played up by the American press, and culminated when Lipinski won the gold medal at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano.

Lipinski retired from competitive figure skating in 1998. She performed in live shows before retiring from figure skating in 2002. Lipinski, along with sports commentator Terry Gannon and fellow figure skater and good friend Johnny Weir, became NBC&#x27;s primary figure skating commentators in 2014.

==Early life==
Tara Kristen Lipinski was born on June 10, 1982, in Philadelphia, to &quot;Pat&quot; Lipinski and oil executive Jack Lipinski. She spent her earliest years in Sewell, New Jersey. When Lipinski was two, while watching the 1984 Summer Olympics, she stood on a Tupperware bowl and pretended to be a gold medalist. At the age of three, she began roller skating and eventually became a national champion in her group when she was nine years old. She began figure skating in the same year, transferring her skills to the ice rink. She later switched exclusively to figure skating and took lessons at the University of Delaware in Newark, Delaware.

In 1991, Lipinski&#x27;s father received a job promotion, so the family moved to Sugar Land, Texas, near Houston. She trained on a public rink at The Galleria. Two years later, Lipinski and her mother returned to Delaware to resume her training there with coach Jeff DiGregorio, who had worked with Lipinski, on and off, for three years before their move to Texas, while her father stayed in Texas to support their family. In 1995, Lipinski and her mother transferred to Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, to train with coach Richard Callaghan at the Detroit Skating Club.

==Competitive career==
===Early years===

In 1994, Lipinski earned a silver medal in the novice women&#x27;s division at the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. When she was 12, she became the youngest athlete to win a gold medal at the 1994 U.S. Olympic Festival. She then took first place in the Blue Swords in Chemnitz, Germany, her first international competition, in November, after which the media began to notice her. As a junior skater, she came in fourth place at the 1995 World Junior Championships and came in second place at the 1995 U.S. Championships. In late 1995, she placed fifth at the 1996 World Junior Championships, which marked the end of the relationship between DiGregorio and the Lipinskis.

After a series of interviews conducted by Lipinski and her mother and sample lessons given to Lipinski by prospective figure skating coaches from around the country, they hired Richard Callaghan. In January 1996, Lipinski won a bronze medal as a senior-level skater at the 1996 U.S. Championships. Despite low expectations, she closed out the 1995–96 season and gained international attention by qualifying for the 1996 World Championships. With very low expectations at the event, she placed 23rd after the short program, but her free skate, which included seven triple jumps, brought her up to 15th place.

===1996–97 season===
Lipinski and Callaghan spent the next year making her appear more mature; she enrolled in ballet classes and hired choreographer Sandra Bezic to &quot;create programs for Lipinski that expressed delight yet looked adult&quot;. In late 1996, she added the triple loop-triple loop jump combination, which added technical difficulty to her programs. She was the first woman to complete the jump combination in competition. Lipinski competed in the ISU Champions Series (later renamed the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating) during the 1996–97 season; she finished in second place at Skate Canada, third at Trophée Lalique, and second at the 1996 Nations Cup. She won the gold medal at the Champion Series Final and defeated Michelle Kwan by completing more successful jumps in her short and free programs.
In February 1997, at the age of 14, Lipinski became the youngest skater to win a U.S. Championships title. She broke the record set by Sonya Klopfer, who was 15 when she won U.S. Nationals in 1951. She defeated Kwan, the reigning 1996 U.S. champion, who won the short program. Kwan fell twice and landed only four out of her seven planned triple jumps in her free skate, leaving the door open for Lipinski&#x27;s victory. She was the last skater to perform in the competition&#x27;s free skating segment; she skated cleanly with seven triple jumps, including her signature jump element, the triple loop-triple loop combination, and came in first place. According to author Ed Swift from &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, the 1997 U.S. Nationals marked the start of the Kwan–Lipinski rivalry.

A month later, Lipinski won the 1997 World Championships and became the youngest female skater to win that event. She was a month younger than the previous record holder, Sonja Henie from Norway, when she won the first of her ten World Championships in 1927. Lipinski completed seven triple jumps, as she had done at the U.S. Nationals and the Champion Series Final, and finished in first place after the short program. She also completed two double Axels, but one rival coach noted the small trajectory of her jumps, stating that &quot;you couldn&#x27;t have put a piece of paper under them&quot;. Her presentation marks were mostly 5.7s or 5.8s and similar to her technical marks. Three out of four judges gave her higher presentation than technical marks.

Reporter Jere Longman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Lipinski&#x27;s free skate &quot;a light, airy performance&quot; and said she was &quot;composed and nearly flawless&quot;. Lipinski opened with a double Axel and landed a triple flip jump as well as her triple loop-triple loop combination, among others. She received 5.8s and 5.9s in her technical marks and a 5.7 and 5.8 for presentation. The final results after the free skate were close, and the judges were unable to declare a clear winner of the free skate. Lipinski, Kwan—who was fourth after the short program—and Russian skater Irina Slutskaya all received first-place votes. Kwan&#x27;s free skate came in first place because she had more first- and second-place votes, and Lipinski came in first place overall because she received more second-place votes in the free skate than Slutskaya. If two more judges had placed Slutskaya before Lipinski after the free skate, Kwan would have won the competition instead of coming in second place. It was the first time the U.S. had finished first and second at Worlds since 1992, when Kristi Yamaguchi won the gold medal and Nancy Kerrigan silver.

===1997–98 season===
====Pre-Olympic season====
Between seasons, Lipinski grew two inches and turned 15 years old. She went into the 1997–98 season by continuing to add more sophistication to her programs by taking daily dance classes from Russian ballet teacher Marina Sheffer. She selected film scores for both her short and free skate program, with the choreographies being created by Sandra Bezic. According to figure skating writer and historian Ellyn Kestnbaum, the American press played up &quot;the Kwan–Lipinski rivalry for all it was worth&quot;.

At the 1997 Skate America, Kwan defeated Lipinski for the first time in three competitions and won the gold medal. Lipinski came in second place after Kwan in both the short program and free skating segment, taking second place overall. Despite performing more difficult jumps than Kwan during her short program, Lipinski consistently received lower technical marks. During her free skate, she fell on a triple Lutz jump, but performed an otherwise technically difficult and strong program. According to Kestnbaum, Callaghan &quot;expressed bewilderment in why the judges had so marked down the reigning World champion, who by virtue of that position might otherwise have been expected to receive the benefit of any doubt&quot;. Lipinski came in second place at Trophée Lalique, behind French skater Laetitia Hubert, who had not won any major competitions since the 1992 World Junior Championships and who came in eleventh place at her previous competition.

Coming into the 1997–98 Champions Series Final, Lipinski was tied for fourth place in the Series standings with Russia&#x27;s Maria Butyrskaya. She won the competition, skating her first clean program of the season. Kwan, although she was eligible, withdrew from the Finals due to injuries. Mike Penner from the &quot;L.A. Times&quot; reported that both Lipinski and Callaghan were concerned about what they considered unfair treatment by the judges at the Champion Series that season, who gave Lipinski lower technical marks than the previous season, as low as 5.3, for an incorrectly performed Lutz. According to Penner, the judges told Callaghan that Lipinski regularly performed her Lutz jumps from the inside edge of her blade instead of from the correct outside edge, something skaters used to call a &quot;flutz&quot;. Lipinski and Callaghan disputed the judges&#x27; marks for her jumps, stating that she had performed them the same way the previous season, when she won both the Worlds and U.S. Nationals. Lipinski&#x27;s lower marks were subject of several articles in major U.S. newspapers. According to reporter Nancy Armour of &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot;, Lipinski showed her best performance of the season at the Finals with a well-executed triple Lutz.

At the 1998 U.S. Championships, Lipinski came in second behind Kwan. In her short program, Lipinski fell on a triple flip attempt, which she called &quot;the lowest point&quot; of her career. She recovered enough from her short program to climb from fourth place to second overall. She would have had to win the free skate and Kwan to come in third place or lower for Lipinski to win the championship. Lipinski performed her free skate program with seven triple jumps, including her trademark triple loop-triple loop and a difficult triple toe loop-half loop-triple Salchow combination. The judges awarded her all 5.8s and 5.9s, except for a pair of 5.7s for presentation.

====1998 Winter Olympics====
U.S. Figure Skating selected Kwan, Lipinski, and Nicole Bobek, who came in third place at Nationals, to send to the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Lipinski and Kwan entered the Olympics as co-favorites to win the gold medal.

In the women&#x27;s individual event, Kwan won the short program with eight of the nine judges putting her in first place. Lipinski came in second place. Swift called Lipinski&#x27;s short program performance, which was technically more difficult than Kwan&#x27;s, &quot;luminous–fast and light and joyful&quot;. Her free skate, featuring her signature triple loop-triple loop combination and seven triple jumps total, was technically the most difficult program in Olympic history up to then. She received 5.8s and 5.9s in presentation marks. Kwan received all 5.9s in presentation but lower technical marks than Lipinski. Kwan performed her free skate almost perfectly, with one minor error during one of her jumps. According to &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter Amy Shipley, Kwan &quot;skated brilliantly and Lipinski skated better&quot;. Swift noted that Kwan&#x27;s performance of her free skate &quot;would have been enough to win at any other Olympics&quot;, but the judges, by awarding her five 5.7s in her technical marks, left room for Lipinski to move ahead. Swift added that Lipinski &quot;had a blast&quot; skating her free skate program and &quot;soared and spun with abandon, filling the [rink] with her joy&quot;. Like Kwan, she completed seven triple jumps, but &quot;the difference was her trademark triple loop-triple loop combination and a wonderful closing triple toe-half loop-triple Salchow [combination]&quot;. According to Kestnbaum, Lipinski&#x27;s jumps were not as big as Kwan&#x27;s and her jump take-offs were not ideal, but her landings were clean and increased in speed as she came out of them. Her spins were faster than Kwan&#x27;s but not as difficult, and their positions were weaker. Kestnbaum also stated: &quot;Nor did [Lipinski&#x27;s] program demonstrate transitional steps as complex, stroking quality as nuanced, or body carriage and line as controlled and elegant&quot;. Lipinski was awarded 5.8s and 5.9s for her technical and presentation marks, and earned six out of nine first-place marks from the judges, winning the gold medal because the free skate was weighted more heavily than the short program.

Lipinski was the youngest Olympic gold medalist in figure skating history. She was the sixth American woman to win an Olympic gold medal in figure skating. Kwan finished in second place, and Chinese skater Lu Chen was the surprise bronze medal winner. Lipinski was two months younger than Sonja Henie when she came in first place at the 1928 Winter Olympics, breaking a record that had stood for 70 years. Single skaters from the same country had not won gold and silver medals at the Olympics since Americans Tenley Albright and Carol Heiss in 1956.

==Professional career==

In March 1998, Lipinski announced her decision to withdraw from the 1998 World Championships, citing a serious glandular infection that required her to have two molars extracted, constant fatigue, and possible mononucleosis. In April, Lipinski announced her intention to turn professional in an interview on the NBC program &quot;Today Show&quot;, thus ending her eligibility to compete at the Olympics again. As her main motivations, she mentioned the desire to end her family&#x27;s separation caused by her skating career and to focus on other goals such as attending college in another two years. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, her decision &quot;sent tremors through the Olympic figure skating community&quot;. &quot;USA Today&quot; criticized her decision, stating that she had taken the easy way out, and compared it to joining the circus. Figure skater Scott Hamilton noted in his book &quot;Landing It: My Life On and Off the Ice&quot; that Lipinski took &quot;an enormous amount of heat&quot; for turning professional.

In 1998, due to many endorsements and book deals, Lipinski&#x27;s net worth was estimated at $12 million. She signed an exclusive deal with CBS to do some acting and to perform in ice shows and non-sanctioned competitions. After the Olympics, Lipinski toured with Champions on Ice, visiting 90 cities in the U.S. In August 1998, she ended her association with Champions on Ice, which she had performed with since 1995, and joined the cast of Stars on Ice in order to improve artistically and participate in the show&#x27;s group numbers. She suffered from sore hips and an injured hip during rehearsals. In the same year, Lipinski wrote two books, &quot;Totally Tara – An Olympic Journey&quot; and &quot;Tara Lipinski: Triumph on Ice&quot;.

In 1999, Lipinski performed with Stars on Ice for a second season and participated in the ISU-sanctioned &quot;Grand Slam of Figure Skating&quot;. She became a spokeswoman for Boys and Girls Clubs of America and an anti-drug advocate, appeared on the soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, and acted in television shows for the Fox Family Network and Nickelodeon. She also became the youngest skater to win the World Professional Figure Skating Championships, completing a triple flip, a triple toe loop, and a triple Salchow jump in her free skate program. Her marks consisted of two 10s, eleven 9.9s, and one 9.8; she won by more than one point over Denise Biellmann, who came in second place.

Lipinski had hip surgery in 2000 at the age of 18, which she believed saved her career. Her injury, a torn labrum in her hip, had been misdiagnosed for four or five years and had caused her a great deal of joint pain. She became a spokesperson to increase awareness about deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which the National Institutes of Health called &quot;a dangerous potential side effect of surgery&quot;. The injury, which might have occurred before the 1998 Winter Olympics, became progressively worse until she was unable to tour. The surgery, which usually lasts 45 minutes, took 3.5 hours to complete because she was developing arthritis, and a cartilage had grown over the bone. She was back on the ice seven days later for light practice with Stars on Ice. She was able to return to touring but had to withdraw from the 2000 World Professional Championships. In 2002, Lipinski toured 61 U.S. cities with Stars on Ice, then retired from skating.

==Skating technique==
Lipinski&#x27;s skating influences were Kristi Yamaguchi, Scott Hamilton, and Christopher Bowman. Her skating style was often contrasted to that of Michelle Kwan: Jere Longman called Lipinski &quot;the consistent Energizer bunny of a jumper&quot; and Kwan &quot;the more sophisticated, complete artist&quot;. Kwan&#x27;s coach Frank Carroll called Lipinski&#x27;s style &quot;wonderful&quot;, adding that she was &quot;turning easy, jumping easy&quot;. Writer Ellyn Kestnbaum remarked that compared to Kwan&#x27;s &quot;more carefully choreographed expressions of joy&quot;, Lipinski displayed &quot;unselfconsious and spontaneous joy in her own movement that projected a greater air of confidence and command of the space&quot;.

Kestnbaum discusses Lipinski&#x27;s skating technique in her book &quot;Culture on Ice: Figure Skating and Cultural Meaning&quot; to illustrate women&#x27;s and girls&#x27; influence on figure skating. She states that &quot;cynics and purists who valued the artistic possibilities of the sport or the fine points of skating technique complained that the judges who awarded Lipinski her gold medals were just counting the jumps and not paying attention to the quality of those jumps, much less to the quality of the rest of her skating&quot;. Kestnbaum uses Lipinski as an example of how teenagers, especially teenage girls, dominated the sport, and how many people in the press criticized the development, some even Lipinski herself for encouraging it. Her jumps, which Kestnbaum calls &quot;small and in some cases technically flawed&quot;, were debated in the press in 1997 and 1998. She notes that Lipinski&#x27;s early programs, choreographed by Sandra Bezik, emphasized her youth and femininity, while by the 1998 Olympics, the focus was on &quot;greater polish or &#x27;maturity&#x27; in her presentation skills&quot;.

In Longman&#x27;s opinion, Lipinski &quot;has propelled the sport forward with the difficulty of her jumps&quot;. Ed Swift remarked that although Lipinski&#x27;s jumps were not big, her spins were &quot;so fast that she seems to dematerialize, like Tinkerbell, in the midst of her jumps&quot;. In March 1997, he stated that Lipinski had &quot;musicality and poise that are far beyond her years&quot;, and although he admitted that she often suffered from nerves, she was &quot;the complete skating package, if a diminutive one, and a pleasure to watch&quot;. In 2018, U.S. Figure Skating president Sam Auxier credited Lipinski for increasing the level of complexity of Olympic skating.

==Broadcasting career==
Lipinski spent a few years traveling and working &quot;here and there&quot; after her retirement from figure skating. She did some acting, but decided that it &quot;just wasn&#x27;t my thing&quot;. In 2009, longing for the high she had felt as a figure skater, she contacted U.S. Figure Skating&#x27;s streaming service Ice Network and offered to work as a commentator for competitions. She began commentating for Universal Sports in 2010 and started working for NBC and NBC Sports in 2011, where she commentated most international figure skating competition broadcasts. Unlike what was customary for skating commentators when she competed, she would call figure skating from studios in the U.S. instead of live at the competition venue. She also became a special correspondent for &quot;Extra&quot; and local NBC affiliates.

Lipinski teamed with sports commentator Terry Gannon and fellow figure skater and good friend Johnny Weir at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi as the network&#x27;s second team of figure skating commentators for their daily live broadcasts. At first Lipinski collaborated with Gannon at the women&#x27;s events and Weir with Gannon at the men&#x27;s events. After realizing that they worked well together, with what Lipinski called their &quot;instant chemistry&quot;, they pitched the idea of the three commentating together for NBC; Lipinski stated that it &quot;was sort of meant to be&quot;. The trio generated the 10 best weekday daytime audiences in NBC&#x27;s history. According to reporter Tom Weir, &quot;they had instant comedic harmony, with their casual chatter and humorous asides playing amazingly well against the staunch and exacting backdrop of figure skating&quot;. Following the Olympics, the trio was promoted to be NBC&#x27;s primary figure skating commentators. Lipinski, along with Weir and Gannon, was an analyst at the 2018 Winter Olympics. Commentating during prime time at the Olympics had been a dream of Lipinski&#x27;s. The trio also hosted the closing ceremonies of the 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2024 Olympic Games.

NBC&#x27;s &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; hired Lipinski and Weir in 2014 to analyze fashion during the red carpet at the 86th Academy Awards. She served as a social media, lifestyle, and fashion correspondent for NBC Sports, including the &quot;Beverly Hills Dog Show&quot; with Weir in 2017, the National Dog Show since 2015, the Kentucky Derby from 2014 to 2018, and the pre-game coverage for the Super Bowl in 2015 and 2017. They were called culture correspondents by &quot;People&quot; magazine for the 2016 Summer Olympics.

According to the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, Lipinski approached broadcasting &quot;with passion, vigor and an arduous work ethic similar to what she brought to the ice&quot;. She spent hundreds of hours researching skaters. Her broadcasting influences were Peggy Fleming, Dick Button, and Scott Hamilton; she listened to tapes of Hamilton&#x27;s past broadcasts to learn how to commentate. She called her broadcasting career her &quot;second dream&quot;. In 2018, she told &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, &quot;I feel extremely grateful that Johnny and I have found this spot in our world, and it gives us opportunities outside of skating&quot;. The same year, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that viewers&#x27; response to Lipinski and Weir were mixed; some considered them &quot;Olympic darlings–a one-stop shop for knowledge, sass and brass&quot;, while others found them &quot;mean, obnoxious, and distracting&quot;. Scott Hamilton, who was replaced at NBC by Lipinski, Weir, and Gannon, called them a &quot;phenomenon&quot; and &quot;such a breath of fresh air&quot;. &quot;GQ&quot; called their commentating style &quot;a Gladwell-ian ability to demystify figure skating for the uninitiated and an extreme candor for which they&#x27;ve caught some heat&quot;.

&quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; considered Lipinski and Weir&#x27;s commentating style honest and colorful, and noted that they used banter and avoided what the magazine called &quot;fluffy, polished performances&quot;. They tried to present figure skating in an accessible way to their viewers, keeping the more technical aspects of the sport to a minimum but emphasizing its &quot;gossipy nuances&quot;. Sports writer and media critic Bill Goodykoontz named their enthusiasm for figure skating their &quot;calling card&quot;. In Dick Button&#x27;s opinion, Lipinski and Weir were &quot;excellent&quot;, but that Lipinski &quot;might talk a little too much&quot;, although Tom Weir stated that when skaters were &quot;elegant and error-free&quot;, both Lipinski and Weir had &quot;the good sense to stay silent&quot;. Goodykoontz pointed out that Lipinski and Weir were uncharacteristically quiet during the short program of Russia&#x27;s Kamila Valieva, representing the Russian Olympic Committee, who was allowed to compete despite failing a drug test prior to the 2022 Winter Olympics. They chose to simply announce Valieva&#x27;s jumps and express their opinions that she should not have been allowed to compete afterwards instead. Their style was applauded and called powerful, but slammed by the Russian media.

In 2018 and 2019, Lipinski and Weir hosted and appeared in a few shows on Food Network, including two seasons of &quot;Wedding Cake Challenge&quot;. In 2022, Lipinski co-hosted &quot;Wedding Talk&quot; with event planner José Rolón and wedding designer Jove Meyer, produced by Chicken Soup for the Soul Studios. In the same year, Lipinski and her husband, Todd Kapostasy, a sports producer and documentary director, co-produced &quot;Meddling: The Olympic Skating Scandal That Shocked the World,&quot; a four-part documentary series focusing on the skating controversy at the 2002 Winter Olympics, which was aired on the NBC streaming service Peacock in January 2022. Lipinski, who called the series &quot;a deep and responsible look at what happened&quot;, said that she and Kapostasy chose to create the series because it was the 20th anniversary of the scandal and there had been no comprehensive look at what happened. They interviewed people in Russia, France, and Canada who were involved in the scandal. &quot;USA Today&quot; calls the documentary &quot;a deep look into the scandal&quot;.

==Personal life==
Lipinski expressed her Catholic faith with a devotion to St. Therese of Lisieux since 1994 and Lipinski credited St. Therese for her Olympic win in 1998 and the recovery from her hip surgery in 2000. During the Olympics, she wore a medal of St. Therese. She thanked St. Therese at the kiss and cry after her short program in Nagano, and her coach held a small statue of St. Therese during her free skate. She also wore a necklace with a good-luck charm, given to her by her uncle, with the words, &quot;Short, but good&quot;. Lipinski would also place a statue of St. Therese on the boards before every competition. A few months after the Nagano Olympics, she donated her medal and costume to an exhibit. In 2001, Lipinski established a playroom in St. Therese&#x27;s honor in the children&#x27;s ward in a Detroit hospital. She said that roses, a symbol of St. Therese, had &quot;always appeared at her best and worst moments&quot;.

Lipinski married sports producer Todd Kapostasy in June 2017. They met at the 2015 Sports Emmys, where she presented his award, and dated the following two years. Johnny Weir was a bridesman and Scott Hamilton was among the invited guests. She has detailed her struggles with infertility in her podcast &quot;Tara Lipinski: Unexpecting&quot;. In October 2023, the couple welcomed their first child, a daughter, via surrogacy.

In September 2020, in order to help raise awareness of the condition, Lipinski made public her diagnosis of endometriosis after having laparoscopic surgery to treat it. Although her symptoms were not severe, the intermittent pain she experienced worsened over five years before it was diagnosed and treated. She reported that her surgery was successful, all of her adhesions were removed, and her recovery was &quot;mainly pain free&quot;. She credited dancer and actress Julianne Hough with increasing awareness of endometriosis, which encouraged Lipinski to seek out her own treatment.

<text>In the fictional universe of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Section 31 is an autonomous intelligence and defense organization that carries out covert operations for the United Federation of Planets. Created by Ira Steven Behr for the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Inquisition&quot;, the organization was intended to act as a counterbalance to the utopian portrayal of the Federation.

Section 31 settings and characters have appeared in dozens of episodes, novels and comics, including the 2025 television film, &quot;Star Trek: Section 31&quot;.

== Production ==
Ira Steven Behr was inspired by a line of dialogue from &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;The Maquis&quot; spoken by Commander Benjamin Sisko: &quot;It&#x27;s easy to be a saint in paradise.&quot; Behr said in the 1999 reference companion to the series, &quot;Why &quot;is&quot; Earth a paradise in the twenty-fourth century? Well, maybe it&#x27;s because there&#x27;s someone watching over it and doing the nasty stuff that no one wants to think about.&quot; He expressed an interest of exploring what life was really like for those living the fictional 24th century, saying &quot;Is it this paradise, or are there, as Harold Pinter said, &#x27;Weasels under the coffee table&#x27;.&quot;

The name, Section 31, is explained in the story as being taken from the fictional Starfleet Charter: Article 14, Section 31. The article, according to agents, allowed for extraordinary measures to be taken in times of extreme threat. Such measures included malicious sabotage of enemy installations and technology, biological warfare, and preemptive assassination.

According to Ronald D. Moore there was considerable debate on the origin of the organization, in particular on how the organization was formed and how long ago.

Costume designer Bob Blackman chose the black leather costumes worn by Section 31 agents to appear fascistic. Behr had asked for dark black, severe, hostile looking costumes. In &quot;Star Trek: The Human Frontier&quot;, Michèle and Duncan Barrett explain that Section 31 agents not wearing Starfleet uniforms or dressing as Federation citizens further enhanced their role as an organization that is not constrained by ethics.

== Reception ==
Writer David Weddle said many fans felt Section 31 betrayed the value system created by Gene Roddenberry, while others were indifferent or intrigued. &quot;Fans would get into these long ethical and political arguments, really struggling with issues like that, which was great to see.&quot; Moore replied to criticisms of betrayal saying, &quot;The idea that there&#x27;s a rogue element within the Federation doing dark deeds outside the normal chain of command is certainly a provocative one.&quot;

Actor Jeffrey Combs, who portrayed numerous characters throughout &quot;Star Trek&quot;, enjoyed the appearances of Section 31, saying the stories &quot;gave everything a real flair.&quot;

<text>Achernar is the brightest star in the constellation of Eridanus and the ninth-brightest in the night sky. It has the Bayer designation Alpha Eridani, which is Latinized from α Eridani and abbreviated Alpha Eri or α Eri. The name Achernar applies to the primary component of a binary system. The two components are designated Alpha Eridani A (the primary) and B (the secondary), with the latter known informally as Achernar B. As determined by the &quot;Hipparcos&quot; astrometry satellite, this system is located at a distance of approximately from the Sun.

Of the ten brightest stars in the night-time sky by apparent magnitude, Alpha Eridani is the hottest and bluest in color because it is spectral type B. Achernar has an unusually rapid rotational velocity, causing it to become oblate in shape. The secondary is smaller, is spectral type A, and orbits Achernar at a distance of .

==Nomenclature==
&quot;α Eridani&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Alpha Eridani&quot;) is the system&#x27;s Bayer designation. The designations of the two components—&quot;Alpha Eridani A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;—derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

The system bears the traditional name of &quot;Achernar&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;Achenar&quot;), derived from the Arabic &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;The End of the River&quot;. However, it seems that this name originally referred to Theta Eridani instead, which latterly was known by the similar traditional name &quot;Acamar&quot;, with the same etymology. The IAU Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) approved the name with the spelling &quot;Achernar&quot; for the component &quot;Alpha Eridani A&quot; on 30 June 2016 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.

In Chinese caused by adaptation of the European Southern Hemisphere constellations into the Chinese system, (), meaning &quot;Crooked Running Water&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of Achernar, ζ Phoenicis and η Phoenicis. Consequently, Achernar itself is known as (, ).

The indigenous Boorong people of northwestern Victoria, Australia, named it &quot;Yerrerdetkurrk&quot;.

USS &quot;Achernar&quot; (AKA-53) was a United States Navy attack cargo ship named after the star.

==Properties==
Achernar is in the deep southern sky and never rises above the horizon north of 33°N, roughly the latitude of Dallas, Texas. It is best seen from the Southern Hemisphere in November; it is circumpolar south of 33°S, roughly the latitude of Santiago. At this latitude—e.g., the south coast of South Africa (Cape Town to Port Elizabeth)—when at lower culmination it is only 1 degree above the horizon. Further south, it is visible at all times during night.
Achernar is a bright, blue star about six to seven times the mass of the Sun. It has a stellar classification of B6 Vep, but despite appearing similar to a main sequence star, it is thought to have recently exhausted the hydrogen in its core and begun to evolve away from the main sequence. It has expanded to an average radius eight times the Sun&#x27;s and is about 3,000 times more luminous. Infrared observations of the star using an adaptive optics system on the Very Large Telescope show that it has a companion star in a close orbit. This appears to be an A-type star in the stellar classification range A0V–A3V, which suggests a stellar mass of about double that of the Sun. The separation of the two stars is and their orbital period is 7 years.

The brightness of Achernar varies very slightly, by a maximum of 0.06 magnitudes or about 6%. A period of is given in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars, but several periods have been identified between about and . The longest periods are very similar to the rotation period of the star, although the exact period appears to vary as the rotational velocity of its upper atmosphere changes. The shortest periods may be harmonics of the longer periods. The variability type of Achernar is given only as a Be star and the exact causes of the brightness changes are unknown. The star itself appears to pulsate and the disk around it varies in size and shape as well as apparently disappearing at times.
As of 2015, Achernar was the least spherical star known in the Milky Way. It spins so rapidly that it has assumed the shape of an oblate spheroid with an equatorial diameter 35% greater than its polar diameter. The oblateness of Achernar is comparable to that of the dwarf planet Haumea, and the stars of Altair and Regulus. The polar axis is inclined about 60.6° to the line of sight from the Earth. Since it is actually a binary star, its highly distorted shape may cause non-negligible departures of the companion&#x27;s orbital trajectory with respect to a Keplerian ellipse. 

Because of the distorted shape of this star, there is a significant temperature variation by latitude. At the pole, the temperature is , while the equator is at . The average temperature of the star is about . The high polar temperatures are generating a fast polar wind that is ejecting matter from the star, creating a polar envelope of hot gas and plasma. The entire star is surrounded by an extended envelope that can be detected by its excess infrared emission, or by its polarization. The presence of a circumstellar disk of ionized gas is a common feature of Be stars such as this. The disk is not stable and periodically collapses back into the star. The maximum polarization for Achernar&#x27;s disk was observed in September 2014, and it is now decreasing.
==Co-moving companion==
The red dwarf 2MASS J01375879−5645447 lies about half a degree north of Achernar. It has been identified as being at the same distance and sharing a common proper motion, as well as being of about the same age. The projected separation of the two is slightly over one light year and they would not be gravitationally bound, but it is proposed that both are part of the Tucana-Horologium association.

==Historical visibility==

Precession caused Achernar to lie much further south in ancient times than at present: 7.5 degrees from the south celestial pole around 3400 BCE (declination ) and still as far south as declination by around 1500 BCE. Hence the Ancient Egyptians could not have known it. Even in 100 CE, its declination was around , meaning Ptolemy could not possibly have seen it from Alexandria. However, it was visible from Syene in the time of the Almagest. 

Until about March 2000, Achernar and Fomalhaut were the two first-magnitude stars farthest from any other, their nearest neighbors being each other. Antares is now the most isolated first-magnitude star. Antares is located in a constellation (Scorpius) with many bright second-magnitude stars, whereas the stars surrounding Alpha Eridani and Fomalhaut are considerably fainter.

The first star atlas to contain Achernar in the chart of Eridanus is Johann Bayer&#x27;s &quot;Uranometria&quot;. Bayer did not observe it himself, and the first European knowledge of it is attributed to Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser on the first voyage of the Dutch to the East Indies (&quot;Eerste Schipvaart&quot;). Thus it was the only first-magnitude star not listed in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;.

Alpha Eridani will continue to move north in the next few millennia, reaching its maximum northern declination between the 8th and 11th millennia, when it will be visible as far north as Germany and southern England.

<doc id="205716" wikidata="Q168748" url="?curid=205716" title="Secretarybird">
<text>The secretarybird or secretary bird (Sagittarius serpentarius) is a large bird of prey that is endemic to Africa. It is mostly terrestrial, spending most of its time on the ground, and is usually found in the open grasslands and savanna of the sub-Saharan region. John Frederick Miller described the species in 1779. A member of the order Accipitriformes, which also includes many other diurnal birds of prey such as eagles, hawks, kites, vultures, and harriers, it is placed in its own family, Sagittariidae.

The secretarybird is instantly recognizable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on crane-like legs that give the bird a height of as much as . The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black flight feathers and thighs.

Breeding can take place at any time of year but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Insects and small vertebrates make up its diet.

Although the secretarybird resides over a large range, the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat destruction. The species is therefore classed as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The secretarybird appears on the coats of arms of Sudan and South Africa.

== Taxonomy ==

The Dutch naturalist Arnout Vosmaer described the secretarybird in 1769 on the basis of a live specimen that had been sent to Holland from the Cape of Good Hope two years earlier by an official of the Dutch East India Company. Vosmaer suggested that the species was called &quot;sagittarius&quot; by the Dutch settlers because its gait was thought to resemble an archer&#x27;s. He also mentioned that it was known as the &quot;secretarius&quot; by farmers who had domesticated the bird to combat pests around their homesteads, and proposed that the word &quot;secretarius&quot; might be a corruption of &quot;sagittarius&quot;. Ian Glenn of the University of the Free State suggests that Vosmaer&#x27;s &quot;sagittarius&quot; is a misheard or mis-transcribed form of &quot;secretarius&quot;, rather than the other way around.
In 1779 the English illustrator John Frederick Miller included a coloured plate of the secretarybird in his &quot;Icones animalium et plantarum&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Falco serpentarius&quot;. As the oldest published specific name, &quot;serpentarius&quot; has priority over later scientific names. The species was assigned to its own genus &quot;Sagittarius&quot; in 1783 by the French naturalist Johann Hermann in his &quot;Tabula affinitatum animalium&quot;. The generic name &quot;Sagittarius&quot; is Latin for &quot;archer&quot;, and the specific epithet &quot;serpentarius&quot; is from Latin &quot;serpens&quot; meaning &quot;serpent&quot; or &quot;snake&quot;. A second edition of Miller&#x27;s plates was published in 1796 as &quot;Cimelia physica&quot;, with added text by English naturalist George Shaw, who named it &quot;Vultur serpentarius&quot;. The French naturalist Georges Cuvier erected the genus &quot;Serpentarius&quot; in 1798, and the German naturalist Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger erected the (now synonymous) genus &quot;Gypogeranus&quot; from the Ancient Greek words &quot;gyps&quot; &quot;vulture&quot; and &quot;geranos&quot; &quot;crane&quot; in 1811.

In 1835 the Irish naturalist William Ogilby spoke at a meeting of the Zoological Society of London and proposed three species of secretarybird, distinguishing those from Senegambia as having broader crest feathers than those from South Africa, and reporting a distinct species from the Philippines based on the writings of Pierre Sonnerat in his &quot;Voyage à la Nouvelle-Guinée&quot;. There is no other evidence this taxon existed. Despite its large range, the secretarybird is considered monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

The evolutionary relationship of the secretarybird to other raptors had long puzzled ornithologists. The species was usually placed in its own family Sagittariidae within the order Falconiformes. A large molecular phylogenetic study published in 2008 concluded that the secretarybird was sister to a clade containing the ospreys in the family Pandionidae and the kites, hawks and eagles in the family Accipitridae. The same study found that the falcons in the order Falconiformes were only distantly related to the other diurnal birds of prey. The families Cathartidae, Sagittariidae, Pandionidae and Accipitridae were therefore moved from Falconiformes to the resurrected Accipitriformes. A later molecular phylogenetic study published in 2015 confirmed these relationships.

The earliest fossils associated with the family are two species from the genus &quot;Pelargopappus&quot;. The two species, from the Oligocene and Miocene respectively, were discovered in France. The feet in these fossils are more like those of the Accipitridae; it is suggested that these characteristics are primitive features within the family. In spite of their age, the two species are not thought to be ancestral to the secretarybird. Though strongly convergent with the modern secretarybird, the extinct raptor &quot;Apatosagittarius&quot; is thought to be an accipitrid.

The International Ornithologists&#x27; Union has designated &quot;secretarybird&quot; the official common name for the species. In 1780 the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon suggested that the name secretary/secrétaire had been chosen because of the long quill-like feathers at the top of the bird&#x27;s neck, reminiscent of a quill pen behind the ear of an ancient scribe. In 1977, C. Hilary Fry of Aberdeen University suggested that &quot;secretary&quot; is from the French &quot;secrétaire&quot;, a corruption of the Arabic &quot;saqr et-tair&quot; meaning either &quot;hawk of the semi-desert&quot; or &quot;hawk that flies&quot;. Glenn has dismissed this etymology on the grounds that there is no evidence that the name came through French, instead supporting Buffon&#x27;s etymology; namely, that the word comes from the Dutch &quot;secretaris&quot; &quot;secretary&quot;, used by settlers in South Africa.

== Description ==
The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large terrestrial bird with an eagle-like head and body on crane-like legs. It stands about tall. It has a length of between and a wingspan of between . The weight ranges from , with a mean of . The averages and the tail is : both factor into making it both taller and longer than any other species of raptor. The neck is not especially long, and can only be lowered down to the intertarsal joint, so birds must stoop to reach down to the ground.

During flight, two elongated central feathers of the tail extend beyond the feet, and the neck stretches out like a stork. The plumage of the crown, upperparts, and lesser and median wing coverts is blue-grey, and the underparts and underwing coverts are lighter grey to grey-white. The crest is made up of long black feathers arising from the nape. The scapulars, primary and secondary flight feathers, rump and thighs are black, while the uppertail coverts are white, though barred with black in some individuals. The tail is wedge-shaped with white tipping, marbled grey and black colouring at the base, and two broad black bands, one at the base and the other at the end.

Sexes resemble one another, although the male tends to have longer tail feathers, more head plumes, a shorter head and more blue-grey plumage. Adults have a featherless red-orange face with pale brown irises and a yellow cere. The legs and feet are pinkish grey, the upper legs clad in black feathers. The toes are short—around 20% of the length of those of an eagle of the same size—and stout, so that the bird is unable to grasp objects with its feet. The rear toe is small and the three forward facing toes are connected at the base by a small web. Immature birds have yellow rather than orange bare skin on their faces, more brownish plumage, shorter tail feathers and greyish rather than brown irises.

Adults are normally silent but can utter a deep guttural croaking noise in nuptial displays or at nests. Secretarybirds make this sound when greeting their mates or in a threat display or fight against other birds, sometimes throwing their head backwards at the same time. When alarmed, the secretarybird may emit a high-pitched croak. Mated pairs at the nest make soft clucking or whistling calls. Chicks make a sharp sound heard as &quot;chee-uk-chee-uk-chee-uk&quot; for their first 30 days.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The secretarybird is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and is generally non-migratory, though it may be locally nomadic as it follows rainfall and the resulting abundance of prey. Its range extends from Senegal to Somalia and south to Western Cape, South Africa.

The species is also found at a variety of elevations, from the coastal plains to the highlands. The secretarybird prefers open grasslands, savannas and shrubland (Karoo) rather than forests and dense shrubbery that may impede its cursorial existence. More specifically, it prefers areas with grass under high and avoids those with grass over high. It is rarer in grasslands in northern parts of its range that otherwise appear similar to areas in southern Africa where it is abundant, suggesting it may avoid hotter regions. It also avoids deserts.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

Secretarybirds are not generally gregarious aside from pairs and their offspring. They usually roost in trees of the genus &quot;Acacia&quot; or &quot;Balanites&quot;, or even introduced pine trees in South Africa. They set off 1–2 hours after dawn, generally after spending some time preening. Mated pairs roost together but may forage separately, though often remaining in sight of one another. They pace around at a speed of , taking 120 steps per minute on average. After spending much of the day on the ground, secretarybirds return at dusk, moving downwind before flying in upwind. Birds encountered singly are often unattached males, their territories generally in less suitable areas. Conversely, larger groups of up to 50 individuals may be present at an area with a localised resource such as a waterhole in a dry area or an irruption of rodents or locusts fleeing a fire.

Secretarybirds soar with their primary feathers splayed to manage turbulence. Their wings can flap, though in a slow laborious manner and requiring uplift to be sustained; otherwise they may become exhausted. In the heat of the day, they use thermals to rise up to above the ground.

The bird&#x27;s average lifespan is thought to be 10 to 15 years in the wild and up to 19 years in captivity. The oldest confirmed secretarybird in the wild was a 5-year-old that was banded as a nestling on 23 July 2011 in Bloemfontein and recovered away in Mpumalanga on 7 June 2016. 

Secretarybirds, like all birds, have haematozoan blood parasites that include &quot;Leucocytozoon beaurepairei&quot; (Dias 1954 recorded from Mozambique). Wild birds from Tanzania have been found to have &quot;Hepatozoon ellisgreineri&quot;, a genus that is unique among avian haematozoa in maturing within granulocytes, mainly neutrophils. Ectoparasites include the lice &quot;Neocolpocephalum cucullare&quot; (Giebel) and &quot;Falcolipeurus secretarius&quot; (Giebel).

=== Breeding ===

Secretarybirds form monogamous pairs and defend a large territory of around . They can breed at any time of the year, more frequently in the late dry season. During courtship, they exhibit a nuptial display by soaring high with undulating flight patterns and calling with guttural croaking. Males and females can also perform a ground display by chasing each other with their wings up and back, which is also the way they defend their territory. They mate either on the ground or in trees.

The nest is built by both sexes at the top of a dense thorny tree, often an &quot;Acacia&quot;, at a height of between above the ground. The nest is constructed as a relatively flat platform of sticks across with a depth . The shallow depression is lined with grass and the occasional piece of dung.

Eggs are laid at 2- to 3-day intervals until the clutch of 1–3 eggs is complete. The elongated chalky bluish green or white eggs average and weigh . Both parents incubate the eggs, starting as soon as the first egg is laid, but it is usually the female that remains on the nest overnight. The incubating parent greets its partner when it returns with a display of bowing and bobbing its head with neck extended. The tail is held upright with feathers fanned out, and the chest feathers are puffed out.

The eggs hatch after around 45 days at intervals of 2–3 days. Both parents feed the young. The adults regurgitate food onto the floor of the nest and then pick up items and pass them to the chicks. For the first 2 or 3 weeks after the eggs hatch the parents take turns to stay at the nest with the young. Despite the difference in nestling size due to the asynchronous hatching, little sibling aggression has been observed. Under favourable conditions all chicks from a clutch of three eggs fledge, but if food is scarce one or more of the chicks will die from starvation. The young may be preyed upon by crows, ravens, hornbills, and large owls. 

The young are born covered in grey-white down that becomes darker grey after two weeks. Their bare facial skin and legs are yellow. Crest feathers appear at 21 days, and flight feathers by 28 days. They can stand up and feed autonomously after 40 days, although the parents still feed the nestlings after that time. At 60 days, the now fully-feathered young start to flap their wings. Their weight gain over this period changes from at hatching, to at 20 days, at 30 days, at 40 days, at 50 days, at 60 days, and at 70 days. The time they leave the nest can be anywhere between 65 and 106 days of age, although it most typically occurs between 75 and 80 days of age. Fledging is accomplished by jumping out of the nest or using a semi-controlled glide to the ground.

Juveniles remain in their natal range before dispersing when they are between 4 and 7 months of age. The usual age at which they first breed is uncertain but there is a record of a male bird breeding successfully at an age of 2 years and 9 months, which is young for a large raptor.

=== Food and feeding ===

Unlike most birds of prey, the secretarybird is largely terrestrial, hunting its prey on foot. Adults hunt in pairs and sometimes as loose familial flocks, stalking through the habitat with long strides. Prey may consist of insects such as locusts, other grasshoppers, wasps, and beetles, but small vertebrates often form main biomass. Secretarybirds are known to hunt rodents, frogs, lizards, small tortoises, and birds such as warblers, larks, doves, small hornbills, and domestic chickens. They occasionally prey on larger mammals such as hedgehogs, mongooses, small felids such as cheetah cubs, striped polecats, young gazelles, and both young and full-grown hares. The importance of snakes in the diet has been exaggerated in the past, although they can be locally important, and venomous species such as adders and cobras are regularly among the types of snakes preyed upon. Secretarybirds do not eat carrion, though they occasionally eat dead animals killed in grass or bushfires.

The birds often flush prey from tall grass by stomping on the surrounding vegetation. Their crest feathers may raise during a hunt, which may serve to help scare the target and provide shade for the face. A bird will chase after prey with the wings spread and kill by striking with swift blows of the feet. Only with small prey items such as wasps will the bird use its bill to pick them directly. There are some reports that, when capturing snakes, a secretarybird will take flight with their prey and then drop them to their death, although this has not been verified. Even with larger prey, food is generally swallowed whole through the birds&#x27; considerable gape. Occasionally, like other raptors, they will hold down a food item with their feet while tearing it apart with their bill.

Food that cannot be digested is regurgitated as pellets in diameter and in length. These are dropped on the ground usually near the roost or nest trees. The secretarybird has a relatively short digestive tract in comparison to large African birds with more mixed diets, such as the kori bustard. The foregut is specialised for the consumption of large amounts of meat and there is little need for the mechanical breakdown of food. The crop is dilated and the gizzard is nonmuscular, as in other carnivorous birds. The large intestine has a pair of vestigial ceca as there is no requirement for the fermentative digestion of plant material.

Secretarybirds specialise in stomping their prey until it is killed or immobilised. This method of hunting is commonly applied to lizards or snakes. An adult male trained to strike at a rubber snake on a force plate was found to hit with a force equal to five times its own body weight, with a contact period of only 10–15 milliseconds. This short time of contact suggests that the secretarybird relies on superior visual targeting to determine the precise location of the prey&#x27;s head. Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird&#x27;s unique stomping and striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency. Ecophysiologist Steve Portugal and colleagues have hypothesised that the extinct Phorusrhacidae (terror birds) may have employed a similar hunting technique to secretarybirds because they are anatomically similar, although they are not closely related.

Secretarybirds rarely encounter other predators, except in the case of tawny eagles, which will steal their kills. Eagles mainly steal larger prey and will attack secretarybirds both singly or in pairs. Secretarybird pairs are sometimes successful in driving the eagles away and may even knock them down and pin them to the ground.

== Relationship with humans ==

=== Cultural significance ===
The secretarybird is depicted on an ivory knife handle recovered from Abu Zaidan in Upper Egypt, dating to the Naqada III culture (c. 3,200 BC). This and other knife handles indicate the secretarybird most likely occurred historically further north along the Nile. 

The secretarybird has traditionally been admired in Africa for its striking appearance and ability to deal with pests and snakes. As such it has often not been disturbed, although this is changing as traditional observances have declined. It is a prominent feature on the coat of arms of South Africa, which was adopted in 2000. With its wings outstretched, it represents growth, and its penchant for killing snakes is symbolic as the protector of the South African state against enemies. It is on the emblem of Sudan, adopted in 1969. It is featured on the Sudanese presidential flag and presidential seal. The secretarybird has been a common motif for African countries on postage stamps: over a hundred stamps from 37 issuers are known, including some from stamp-issuing entities such as Ajman, Manama, and the Maldives, regions where the bird does not exist, as well as the United Nations.

The Maasai people call it &quot;ol-enbai nabo&quot;, or &quot;one arrow&quot;, referring to its crest feathers. They have used parts of the bird in traditional medicine: its feathers could be burnt and the resulting smoke inhaled to treat epilepsy, its egg could be consumed with tea twice daily to treat headaches, and its fat could be boiled and drunk for child growth or livestock health. The Xhosa people call the bird &quot;inxhanxhosi&quot; and attribute great intelligence to it in folklore. The Zulus call it &quot;intungunono&quot;.

The German biologist Ragnar Kinzelbach proposed in 2008 that the secretarybird was recorded in the 13th-century work &quot;De arte venandi cum avibus&quot; by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Described as &quot;bistarda deserti&quot;, it was mistaken for a bustard. Frederick most likely gained knowledge of the bird from sources in Egypt. The 16th-century French priest and traveller André Thevet also wrote a description of a mysterious bird in 1558 that has been likened by Kinzelbach to this species.

=== Threats and conservation ===
In 1968 the species became protected under the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) listed the secretarybird in 2016 as a vulnerable species and as endangered in 2020, due to a recent rapid decline across its entire range. Although widespread, the species is thinly distributed across its range; its population has been estimated in 2016 to be anywhere between 6,700 and 67,000 individuals. Long term monitoring across South Africa between 1987 and 2013 has shown that populations have declined across the country, even in protected areas such as Kruger National Park due to woody plant encroachment, an increase in the tall vegetation cover, resulting in loss of open habitat that the species prefers.

As a population, the secretarybird is mainly threatened by loss of habitat due to fragmentation by roads and development and overgrazing of grasslands by livestock. Some adaptation to altered areas has been recorded, but overall numbers are declining.

=== In captivity ===
The first successful rearing of a secretarybird in captivity occurred in 1986 at the Oklahoma City Zoo. Although secretarybirds normally build their nests in the trees in the wild, the captive birds at the zoo built theirs on the ground, which left them open to depredation by local wild mammals. To address this problem, the zoo staff removed the eggs from the nest each time they were laid so that they could be incubated and hatched at a safer location. The species has also been bred and reared in captivity at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park.

In June 2024, a secretarybird chick was successfully hatched at Longleat Safari Park in Wiltshire, born to parents Janine and Kevin, who have lived at the park since 2018. The chick’s sex is not yet known, and keepers are providing smaller food items for the protective parents. This successful hatch is seen as a promising step towards establishing a new breeding program for the species at the park.

<text>Mimosa is the second-brightest object in the southern constellation of Crux (after Acrux), and the 20th-brightest star in the night sky. It has the Bayer designation β Crucis, which is Latinised to Beta Crucis and abbreviated Beta Cru or β Cru. Mimosa forms part of the prominent asterism called the Southern Cross. It is a binary star or a possible triple star system.

== Nomenclature==

&quot;β Crucis&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Beta Crucis&quot;) is the system&#x27;s Bayer designation. Although Mimosa is at roughly −60° declination, and therefore not visible north of 30° latitude, in the time of the ancient Greeks and Romans it was visible north of 40° due to the precession of equinoxes, and these civilizations regarded it as part of the constellation of Centaurus.

It bore the traditional names &quot;Mimosa&quot; and the historical name &quot;Becrux&quot; . &quot;Mimosa&quot;, which is derived from the Latin for &#x27;actor&#x27;, may come from the flower of the same name. &quot;Becrux&quot; is a modern contraction of the Bayer designation. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Mimosa&quot; for this star.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Cross&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of Acrux, Mimosa, Gamma Crucis, and Delta Crucis. Consequently, Mimosa itself is known as (, .).

==Stellar system ==

Based on parallax measurements, Mimosa is located at a distance of from the Earth. In 1957, German astronomer Wulff-Dieter Heintz discovered that it is a spectroscopic binary with components that are too close together to resolve with a telescope. The pair orbit each other every 5 years with an estimated separation that varies from 5.4 to 12.0 Astronomical Units. The system is only 8 to 11 million years old.

The primary, β Crucis A, has a stellar classification of B0.5 III, classifying it as a blue giant that exausted the hydrogen supply at its core. Asteroseismic observations have measured its mass to be 15 times the Sun&#x27;s mass, its radius to be between 7.3 and 8.9 times the Sun&#x27;s radius and its age to be 11 million yearsit is the most massive star with an age derived by this method. Mimosa has sufficient mass to explode as a supernova, which might occur in roughly 6 million years. The projected rotational velocity of this star is about . However, the orbital plane of the pair is only about 10°, which probably means the inclination of the star&#x27;s pole is also likely to be low. This suggests that the azimuthal rotational velocity is quite high, at about . This star has an orbital period of only about 3.6 days.
β Crucis A is a known β Cephei variable, although with an effective temperature of about 27,000 K it is at the hot edge of the instability strip where such stars are found. It has three different pulsation modes, none of which are radial. The periods of all three modes are in the range of 4.03–4.59 hours. The high temperature of the star&#x27;s outer envelope is what gives the star the blue-white hue that is characteristic of B-type stars. It is generating a strong stellar wind and is losing about per year, or the equivalent of the mass of the Sun every 100 million years. The wind is leaving the system with a velocity of 2,000 km s−1 or more.

The secondary, β Crucis B, may be a main sequence star with a stellar class of B2. In 2007, a third companion was announced, which may be a low mass, pre-main sequence star. The X-ray emission from this star was detected using the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Two other stars, located at angular separations of 44 and 370 arcseconds, are likely optical companions that are not physically associated with the system. The β Crucis system may be a member of the Lower Centaurus–Crux sub-group of the Scorpius–Centaurus association. This is a stellar association of stars that share a common origin.

==In culture==

Mimosa is represented in the flags of Australia, New Zealand, Samoa and Papua New Guinea as one of five stars making up the Southern Cross. It is also featured in the flag of Brazil, along with 26 other stars, each of which represents a state. Mimosa represents the State of Rio de Janeiro.

A vessel named &quot;MV Becrux&quot; is used to export live cattle from Australia to customers in Asia. An episode dedicated to the vessel features in the television documentary series &quot;Mighty Ships&quot;.

<doc id="205719" wikidata="Q13175" url="?curid=205719" title="Beta Centauri">
<text>Beta Centauri is a triple star system in the southern constellation of Centaurus. It is officially called Hadar (). The Bayer designation of Beta Centauri is Latinised from β Centauri, and abbreviated Beta Cen or β Cen. The system&#x27;s combined apparent visual magnitude of 0.61 makes it the second-brightest object in Centaurus and the eleventh brightest star in the night sky. According to dynamical parallax measurements, the distance to this system is about .

==Nomenclature==
&quot;β Centauri&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Beta Centauri&quot;) is the star system&#x27;s Bayer designation.

It bore the traditional names &quot;Hadar&quot; and &quot;Agena&quot;. &quot;Hadar&quot; comes from the Arabic حضار (the root&#x27;s meaning is &quot;to be present&quot; or &quot;on the ground&quot; or &quot;settled, civilized area&quot;), while the name &quot;Agena&quot; is thought to be derived from the Latin &quot;genua&quot;, meaning &quot;knees&quot;, from the star&#x27;s position on the left knee of the centaur depicted in the constellation Centaurus. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name &quot;Hadar&quot; for the star β Centauri Aa on 21 August 2016 and it is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. 

The Chinese name for the star is 马腹一 (Mandarin: mǎ fù yī, &quot;the First Star of the Horse&#x27;s Abdomen&quot;).

The Boorong people indigenous to what is now northwestern Victoria, Australia named it &quot;Bermbermgle&quot; (together with α Centauri), two brothers who were noted for their courage and destructiveness, and who spear and kill Tchingal, &quot;The Emu&quot; (Coalsack Nebula). The Wotjobaluk people name the two brothers &quot;Bram-bram-bult&quot;.

==Visibility==
Beta Centauri is one of the brightest stars in the sky at magnitude 0.61. Its brightness varies by a few hundredths of a magnitude, too small to be noticeable to the naked eye. Because of its spectral type and the detection of pulsations, the Aa component has been classified as a β Cephei variable.

Beta Centauri is well known in the Southern Hemisphere as the inner of the two &quot;Pointers&quot; to the constellation Crux, popularly known as the Southern Cross. A line made from the other pointer, Alpha Centauri, through Beta Centauri leads to within a few degrees of Gacrux, the star at the north end of the cross. Using Gacrux, a navigator can draw a line with Acrux at the south end to effectively determine south.

==Stellar system==
The Beta Centauri system is made up of three stars: Beta Centauri Aa, Beta Centauri Ab, and Beta Centauri B. All the spectral lines detected are consistent with a B1-type star, with only the line profiles varying, so it is thought that all three stars have the same spectral type.

In 1935, Joan Voûte identified Beta Centauri B, giving it the identifier VOU 31. The companion is separated from the primary by 1.3 seconds of arc, and has remained so since the discovery, although the position angle has changed six degrees since. Beta Centauri B is a B1 dwarf with an apparent magnitude of 4.

In 1967, Beta Centauri&#x27;s observed variation in radial velocity suggested that Beta Centauri A is a binary star. This was confirmed in 1999. It consists of a pair of stars, β Centauri Aa and β Centauri Ab, of similar mass that orbit each other over a period of 357 days with a large eccentricity of about 0.8245.

The pair were calculated to be separated by a mean distance of roughly 4 astronomical units (based on a distance to the system of 161 parsecs) in 2005.
Both Aa and Ab apparently have a stellar classification of B1 III, with the luminosity class of III indicating giant stars that are evolving away from the main sequence. Component Aa rotates much more rapidly than Ab, causing its spectral lines to be broader, and so the two components can be distinguished in the spectrum. Component Ab, the slow-rotating star, has a strong magnetic field although no detected abundance peculiarities in its spectrum. Multiple pulsations modes have been detected in component Aa, some of which correspond to brightness variations, so this star is considered to be variable. The detected pulsation modes correspond to those for both β Cephei variables and slowly pulsating B stars. Similar pulsations have not been detected in component Ab, but it is possible that it is also a variable star.

Aa is 12.02 times as massive as the Sun, while Ab is 10.58 times as massive. Their angular diameters are estimated at 0.77 and 0.72 milliarcseconds. At the system&#x27;s distance of , this derive liner radii of and solar radii, respectively.

<doc id="205720" wikidata="Q257308" url="?curid=205720" title="Florence Ballard">
<text>Florence Glenda Chapman (&quot;née&quot; Ballard; June 30, 1943 – February 22, 1976) was an American singer and a founding member of the Motown vocal female group the Supremes. She sang on 16 top 40 singles with the group, including ten number-one hits. After being removed from the Supremes in 1967, Ballard tried an unsuccessful solo career with ABC Records before she was dropped from the label at the end of the decade.

Ballard struggled with alcoholism, depression, and poverty for three years. She was making an attempt at a musical comeback when she died of a heart attack in February 1976 at the age of 32. Ballard&#x27;s death was considered by one critic as &quot;one of rock&#x27;s greatest tragedies&quot;. Ballard was posthumously inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Supremes in 1988.

==Early life==
Florence Glenda Ballard was born in Detroit, Michigan on June 30, 1943 to Lurlee (&quot;née&quot; Wilson) and Jesse Ballard, as the eighth of thirteen children or ninth of fifteen children. Her siblings were Bertie, Cornell, Jesse, Jr., Gilbert, Geraldine, Barbara, Maxine, Billy, Calvin, Pat, Linda, and Roy. Her mother was a resident of Rosetta, Mississippi. Her father was born Jesse Lambert in Bessemer, Alabama; after his grandmother was shot and killed, he was adopted by the Ballard family. Jesse Ballard left his adoptive parents at 13 and soon engaged in an affair with Florence&#x27;s mother Lurlee, who was only 14, in Rosetta. The Ballards moved to Detroit in 1929 as part of the Great Migration. Jesse worked at General Motors. Her brother, Roy was killed by a drunk driver at the age of three, her mother gave birth to twins who died at five months old and a daughter who died in infancy. Jesse, an amateur musician, helped inspire Florence&#x27;s interest in singing; he taught songs to her, accompanying her on guitar. Financial difficulties forced the Ballard family to move to different Detroit neighborhoods; by the time Florence turned 15 they had settled at Detroit&#x27;s Brewster-Douglass housing projects, and the next year Jesse Lambert Ballard died of cancer.

Named &quot;Blondie&quot; and &quot;Flo&quot; by family and friends, Ballard attended Northeastern High School and was coached vocally by Abraham Silver. Ballard met future singing partner Mary Wilson during a middle-school talent show and they became friends while attending Northeastern High. From an early age, Ballard aspired to be a singer and agreed to audition for a spot in the sister group and local Detroit attraction, the Primes, who were managed by Milton Jenkins. After being accepted, Ballard recruited Mary Wilson to join Jenkins&#x27; group. Paul Williams of The Primes (who would later evolve into The Temptations), in turn, enlisted another neighbor, Diana Ross, then going by &quot;Diane&quot;. Betty McGlown completed the original lineup and Jenkins named them &quot;The Primettes&quot;. The group performed at talent showcases and at school parties before auditioning for Motown Records in 1960. Berry Gordy, head of Motown, advised the group to graduate from high school before auditioning again. Ballard eventually dropped out of high school though her groupmates graduated.

In 1960, Ballard was allegedly raped at knifepoint by local high-school basketball player Reggie Harding after leaving a sock hop at Detroit&#x27;s Graystone Ballroom (she had arrived with her brother, but they lost track of each other). The rape occurred in an empty parking lot off Woodward Avenue. Ballard reacted by secluding herself in her house and refusing to come outside, which worried her groupmates. Weeks later, Ballard told Wilson and Ross what had happened, and they were sympathetic. Both Wilson and Jesse Green, an early boyfriend of Florence&#x27;s, had described her as a &quot;generally happy if somewhat mischievous and sassy teenager.&quot; Wilson believes that the incident heavily contributed to the self-destructive aspects of Ballard&#x27;s adult personality, like cynicism, pessimism, and fear and distrust of others, but the rape was never mentioned again.

==Career==
===The Supremes (1959–1967)===

 Later in 1960, the Primettes signed a contract with Lu Pine Records, issuing two songs that failed to perform well. During that year, they kept pursuing a Motown contract and agreed to do anything that was required, including adding handclaps and vocal backgrounds. By the end of the year, Berry Gordy agreed to have the group record songs in the studio. In early 1961, Gordy agreed to sign them on the condition they change their name. Janie Bradford approached Ballard with a list of names to choose from before Ballard chose &quot;Supremes&quot;. The other members were displeased when they heard the new name. Diana Ross worried they would be mistaken for a male vocal group, but Gordy agreed to sign them under that name on January 15, 1961.

The group struggled in their early years with the label, releasing eight singles that failed to crack the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, giving them the nickname &quot;no-hit Supremes&quot;. One track, &quot;Buttered Popcorn&quot;, led by Ballard, was a regional hit in the Midwest, but still failed to chart. In the early spring of 1962 while the Marvelettes were on tour, Ballard briefly replaced its group member Wanda Young while she was on maternity leave. Before the release of their 1962 debut album, &quot;Meet the Supremes&quot;, Barbara Martin, who had replaced Betty McGlown a year before they signed to Motown, left the group and it became a trio. After the hit success of 1963&#x27;s &quot;When the Love Light Starts Shining Through His Eyes&quot;, Diana Ross became the group&#x27;s lead singer.

In the spring of 1964, the group released &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot;, which became their first number-one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, paving the way for ten number-one hits recorded by Ross, Ballard and Wilson between 1964 and 1967. After many rehearsals with Cholly Atkins and Maurice King, the Supremes&#x27; live shows improved dramatically. Ballard sang lead on several songs on Supremes&#x27;s albums, including a cover of Sam Cooke&#x27;s &quot;(Ain&#x27;t That) Good News&quot;. During live shows, Ballard often performed the Barbra Streisand standard, &quot;People&quot;. According to Mary Wilson, Ballard&#x27;s vocals were so loud she was made to stand 17 feet away from her microphone during recording sessions. Marvin Gaye, for whom Ballard sang backing vocals on occasion, described her as &quot;a hell of a singer, probably the strongest of the three girls.&quot; Overall, Ballard contributed vocals to ten number-one pop hits and 16 top forty hit singles between 1963 and 1967.

===Exit from the Supremes and solo career (1967–1970)===
Ballard expressed dissatisfaction with the group&#x27;s direction throughout its successful times. She would also claim that their schedule had forced the group members to drift apart. Ballard blamed Motown Records for destroying the group dynamic by making Diana Ross the star. Struggling to cope with the label&#x27;s demands and her own depression, Ballard turned to alcohol for comfort, leading to arguments with Ross and Wilson. Ballard&#x27;s alcoholism led to her missing performances and recording sessions. Gordy sometimes replaced Ballard on stage with the Andantes&#x27; Marlene Barrow. In April 1967, Cindy Birdsong, member of Patti LaBelle and the Blue Belles, became a stand-in for Ballard. A month later, Ballard returned to the group from what she thought was a temporary leave of absence. In June, Gordy changed the group&#x27;s name to &quot;Diana Ross and The Supremes&quot;, which was how they were billed on the marquee of Las Vegas&#x27; Flamingo Hotel.

On July 1, the day after her 24th birthday, Ballard showed up inebriated during the group&#x27;s third performance at the Flamingo and her stomach bulged under her suit. Angered, Gordy ordered her to return to Detroit, and Birdsong officially replaced her, abruptly ending her tenure with the Supremes. It had been decided as early as May that Birdsong would replace Ballard once Birdsong&#x27;s contract with the Bluebelles was bought out. In August 1967, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; reported that Ballard had taken a temporary leave of absence from the group due to &quot;exhaustion&quot;. Ballard married her boyfriend, Thomas Chapman, on February 29, 1968. A week earlier, on February 22, Ballard and Motown negotiated for her release from the label. Her attorney in the matter received a one-time payment of $139,804.94 in royalties and earnings from Motown. As part of the settlement, Ballard was advised not to promote herself by using her former membership in the Supremes. In March 1968, Ballard signed with ABC Records and released two unsuccessful singles. 

In 1968, Florence Ballard put her unique spin on the hit &quot;Walk on By&quot;, originally sung by Dionne Warwick and crafted by the iconic duo Burt Bacharach and Hal David. Her cover was eventually included in &quot;The Supreme Florence Ballard&quot; album, which was released after her passing on April 2, 2001. The original &quot;Walk on By&quot;, made famous by Warwick and also written by Bacharach and David, debuted as a single in April 1964.

After an album for the label was shelved, her settlement money was depleted from the Chapmans&#x27; management agency, Talent Management, Inc. The agency had been led by Leonard Baun, the attorney who had helped to settle Ballard&#x27;s departure from Motown. Following news that Baun was facing multiple embezzlement charges, Ballard fired him. She continued to perform as a solo artist. In January 1969, Ballard performed at one of newly elected President Richard Nixon&#x27;s inaugural balls. Ballard was dropped by ABC in 1970.

===Decline (1971–1974)===
In July 1971, Ballard sued Motown for additional royalty payments she believed she was due to receive but she was defeated in court by Motown. Shortly afterwards, Ballard and her husband separated following domestic disputes, and Ballard&#x27;s home was foreclosed. Facing poverty and depression, Ballard became an alcoholic and shunned the spotlight. In 1972, she moved into her sister Maxine&#x27;s house. In 1974, Mary Wilson invited Ballard to join the Supremes (with their current lineup of Cindy Birdsong and Scherrie Payne) onstage at Magic Mountain. Though Ballard played tambourine, she did not sing and told Wilson she had no ambition to sing anymore. Later that year Ballard&#x27;s plight began to appear in newspapers as word of her application for welfare benefits leaked out. Around that time, Ballard entered Henry Ford Hospital for rehab treatment. Following six weeks of treatment, Ballard began to slowly recover.

===Comeback (1975–1976)===
In early 1975, Ballard received a settlement from her former attorney&#x27;s insurance company. The money helped her buy a house on Shaftsbury Avenue. Inspired by the financial success, Ballard decided to return to singing and reconciled with her husband. Ballard&#x27;s first concert performance in more than five years took place at the Henry and Edsel Ford Auditorium in Detroit on June 25, 1975. Ballard performed as part of the Joan Little Defense League and was backed by female rock group the Deadly Nightshade. Afterwards, she began receiving interview requests; &quot;Jet&quot; magazine was one of the first to report on Ballard and her recovery.

==Death==
On February 21, 1976, Ballard entered Mt. Carmel Mercy Hospital, complaining of numbness in her extremities. She died at 10:05 ET the next morning from cardiac arrest caused by a coronary thrombosis (a blood clot in one of her coronary arteries), at the age of 32. 
Ballard is buried in Detroit Memorial Park Cemetery in Warren, Michigan.

On June 30, 2021, a headstone was placed at Florence Ballard&#x27;s gravesite in honor of her birthday. Although she had a basic gravestone from the time of her burial, it was not until this date that a proper memorial headstone was dedicated to her legacy.

==Legacy==
Florence Ballard&#x27;s story has been referenced in a number of works by other artists. The 1980 song &quot;Romeo&#x27;s Tune&quot;, from Steve Forbert&#x27;s album &quot;Jackrabbit Slim&quot;, is &quot;dedicated to the memory of Florence Ballard&quot;. In his short story &quot;You Know They Got a Hell of a Band&quot;, Stephen King, through the late disc jockey Alan Freed, includes Ballard as one of the deceased artists who performs in a town called &quot;Rock and Roll Heaven&quot;.

&quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, a 1981 Broadway musical, chronicles a fictional group called &quot;The Dreams&quot;, and a number of plot components parallel events in the Supremes&#x27; career. The central character of Effie White, like Florence Ballard, is criticized for being overweight, and is fired from the group. The film version of &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; released in 2006 features more overt references to Ballard&#x27;s life and the Supremes&#x27; story, including gowns and album covers that are direct copies of Supremes originals. Jennifer Hudson won a Golden Globe Award and Academy Award for her portrayal of Effie White in the &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; film. In her Golden Globe acceptance speech, Hudson dedicated her win to Florence Ballard. The music video for the Diana Ross song &quot;Missing You&quot; pays tribute to Marvin Gaye, Ballard, and Paul Williams, all former Motown artists who had died. In 1988, Ballard was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Supremes alongside Diana Ross and Mary Wilson.

In February 2020, a new play about Ballard by Vincent Victoria entitled &quot;Dreamgirl Deferred&quot; premiered in Houston on the anniversary of her death.

In the 2013 &quot;&quot; Broadway stage play that launched on April 14, Ballard was portrayed by Sydney Morton.

As a member of The Supremes, Ballard was named as one of eight recipients to receive a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards in 2023.

==Personal life==
Ballard began dating Thomas Chapman, a Motown Records chauffeur, in 1967; they married in a private celebration in Hawaii on February 29, 1968, and had three daughters: twins Michelle Denise and Nicole Reneé (b. 1968) and Lisa Sabrina (b. 1972). Ballard reportedly had several domestic disputes with her husband and filed for divorce in 1973, but they reconciled in late 1975, prior to her death. Besides her three daughters, Ballard&#x27;s family included her cousin, rhythm and blues singer and songwriter Hank Ballard, and his grandnephew, NFL player Christian Ballard; she was also an aunt of the Detroit electronic musician Omar-S.

<doc id="205721" wikidata="Q76493786" url="?curid=205721" title="Regulus">
<text>Regulus is the brightest object in the constellation Leo and one of the brightest stars in the night sky. It has the Bayer designation designated α Leonis, which is Latinized to Alpha Leonis, and abbreviated Alpha Leo or α Leo. Regulus appears singular, but is actually a quadruple star system composed of four stars that are organized into two pairs. The spectroscopic binary Regulus A consists of a blue-white main-sequence star and its companion, which has not yet been directly observed, but is probably a white dwarf. The system lies approximately 79 light years from the Solar System.

HD 87884 is separated from Regulus by and is itself a close pair. Regulus, along with five slightly dimmer stars (Zeta Leonis, Mu Leonis, Gamma Leonis, Epsilon Leonis, and Eta Leonis) have collectively been called &#x27;the Sickle&#x27;, which is an asterism that marks the head of Leo.

== Nomenclature ==
&quot;α Leonis&quot; (Latinized to &quot;Alpha Leonis&quot;) is the star system&#x27;s Bayer designation. The traditional name &quot;Rēgulus&quot; is Latin for &#x27;prince&#x27; or &#x27;little king&#x27;. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Regulus&quot; for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

== Observation ==
The Regulus system as a whole is the twenty-first brightest star in the night sky with an apparent magnitude of +1.35. The light output is dominated by Regulus A. Regulus B, if seen in isolation, would be a binocular object of magnitude +8.1, and its companion, Regulus C, the faintest of the three stars that has been directly observed, would require a substantial telescope to be seen, at magnitude +13.5. Regulus A is itself a spectroscopic binary; the secondary star has not yet been directly observed as it is much fainter than the primary. The BC pair lies at an angular distance of 177 arc-seconds from Regulus A, making them visible in amateur telescopes.
Regulus is 0.465 degrees from the ecliptic, the closest of the bright stars, and is often occulted by the Moon. This occurs in spates every 9.3 years, due to lunar precession. The last spate was around 2017, with occultations every month from December 2016 till July 2017, each one limited to certain areas on Earth. Occultations by Mercury and Venus are possible but rare, as are occultations by asteroids. Seven other stars which have a Bayer designation are less than 0.9° from the ecliptic (perfected, mean plane of Earth&#x27;s orbit and mean apparent path of the Sun) the next brightest of which is δ (Delta) Geminorum, of magnitude +3.53. As Regulus closely aligns to the mean orbits of large bodies of the Solar System and involves more light reaching the Earth than such other stars, the system has advanced telescopic use (to study and identify objects occulting and casting their shadow on a telescope, including known or unknown asteroids of the Solar System such as Trojans, being in line by definition with their associated planetary plane).

The last occultation of Regulus by a planet was on July 7, 1959, by Venus. The next will occur on October 1, 2044, also by Venus. Other planets will not occult Regulus over the next few millennia because of their node positions. An occultation of Regulus by the asteroid 166 Rhodope was filmed in Italy on October 19, 2005. Differential bending of light was measured to be consistent with general relativity. Regulus was occulted by the asteroid 163 Erigone in the early morning of March 20, 2014. The center of the shadow path passed through New York and eastern Ontario, but no one is known to have seen it, due to cloud cover. The International Occultation Timing Association recorded no observations at all.

Although best seen in the evening in the northern hemisphere&#x27;s late winter and spring, Regulus appears at some time of night throughout the year except for about a month (depending on ability to compensate for the sun&#x27;s glare, ideally done so in twilight) on either side of August 22–24, when the Sun is too close. The star can be viewed the whole night, crossing the sky, in late February. Regulus passes through SOHO&#x27;s LASCO C3 every August. 

For Earth observers, the heliacal rising (pre-sunrise appearance) of Regulus occurs late in the first week of September, or in the second week. Every 8 years, Venus passes very near the star system around or a few days before the heliacal rising, as on 5 September 2022 (the superior conjunction of Venus happens about two days earlier with each turn of its 8-year cycle, so as this cycle continues Venus will more definitely pass Regulus &quot;before&quot; the star&#x27;s heliacal rising).

==Stellar system==
Regulus is a multiple star system consisting of at least four stars and a substellar object. Regulus A is the dominant star, with a binary companion 177&quot; distant that is thought to be physically related. Regulus D is a 12th magnitude companion at 212&quot;, but is an unrelated background object.

Regulus A is a binary star consisting of a blue-white subgiant star of spectral type B8, which is orbited by a star of at least 0.3 solar masses, which is probably a white dwarf. The two stars take approximately 40 days to complete an orbit around their common centre of mass. Given the extremely distorted shape of the primary, the relative orbital motion may be notably altered with respect to the two-body purely Keplerian scenario because of non-negligible long-term orbital perturbations affecting, for example, its orbital period. In other words, Kepler&#x27;s third law, which holds exactly only for two point-like masses, would no longer be valid for the Regulus system. Regulus A was long thought to be fairly young, only 50–100 million years old, calculated by comparing its temperature, luminosity, and mass. The existence of a white dwarf companion would mean that the system is at least 1 billion years old, just to account for the formation of the white dwarf. The discrepancy can be accounted for by a history of mass transfer onto a once-smaller Regulus A.

The primary of Regulus A has about 4.15 times the Sun&#x27;s mass. It is spinning extremely rapidly, with a rotation period of only 15.9 hours (for comparison, the rotation period of the Sun is 25 days), which causes it to have a highly oblate shape. This results in so-called gravity darkening: the photosphere at Regulus&#x27; poles is considerably hotter, and five times brighter per unit surface area, than its equatorial region. The star&#x27;s surface at the equator rotates at about 320 kilometres per second (199 miles per second), or 96.5% of its critical angular velocity for break-up. It is emitting polarized light because of this.

Regulus BC is 5,000 AU from Regulus A. A and BC share a common proper motion and are thought to orbit each other taking several million years. Designated Regulus B and Regulus C, the pair has Henry Draper Catalogue number HD 87884. The first is a K2V star, while the second is about M4V. The companion pair has an orbital period of about 600 years with a separation of 2.5&quot; in 1942.

A far more distant brown dwarf named SDSS J1007+1930 (full name: SDSS J100711.74+193056.2) may be bound to the Regulus system, it share similar proper motion and radial velocity and has a similar metal abundance to Regulus B, which hints for a physical connection between both systems. The estimated distance from Regulus is (), and the orbital period assuming an circular orbit would be around 200 million years, comparable to the Sun&#x27;s orbital period around the Milky Way (galactic year). It is estimated to have a mass of roughly (), an effective temperature of and a spectral type L9 or T0, making it a L dwarf or T dwarf. In the future it will either be stripped away by stellar encounters because it is so weakly bound to the system, or it was once closer and got ejected by dynamical interactions. The extreme distance makes it uncertain to conclude whether it is gravitationally bound to Regulus.


== Etymology and cultural associations ==

&quot;Rēgulus&quot; is Latin for &#x27;prince&#x27; or &#x27;little king&#x27;; its Greek equivalent is Basiliskos or, in Latinised form, Basiliscus. The name Regulus first appeared in the early 16th century. It is also known as Qalb al-Asad, from the Arabic قلب الأسد, meaning &#x27;the heart of the lion&#x27;, a name already attested in the Greek Kardia Leontos whose Latin equivalent is Cor Leōnis. The Arabic phrase is sometimes approximated as Kabelaced. In Chinese it is known as 軒轅十四, the Fourteenth Star of Xuanyuan, the Yellow Emperor. In Indian astronomy, Regulus corresponds to the Nakshatra Magha (&quot;the bountiful&quot;).

Babylonians called it &quot;Sharru&quot; (&quot;the King&quot;), and it marked the 15th ecliptic constellation. In India it was known as &quot;Maghā&quot; (&quot;the Mighty&quot;), in Sogdiana &quot;Magh&quot; (&quot;the Great&quot;), in Persia &quot;Miyan&quot; (&quot;the Centre&quot;) and also as one of the four &#x27;royal stars&#x27; of the Persian monarchy. It was one of the fifteen Behenian stars known to medieval astrologers, associated with granite, mugwort, and the kabbalistic symbol .

In the Babylonian MUL.APIN, Regulus is listed as Lugal, meaning king, with co-descriptor, &quot;star of the Lion&#x27;s breast&quot;.

<text>The Rostratulidae, commonly known as the painted-snipes, are a family of wading birds that consists of two genera: &quot;Rostratula&quot; and &quot;Nycticryphes&quot;.

==Description==
The painted-snipes are short-legged, long-billed birds similar in shape to the true snipes, but their plumage is much more striking. There is sexual dimorphism in both size and plumage, with the males being duller overall and smaller. All three species have large forward pointing eyes.

==Phylogenetics==
The family Rostratulidae encompasses two genera and four species, one of which is extinct. Painted-snipes superficially resemble true snipes, but the two taxa are not closely related. Instead the similarity can be attributed to convergent evolution where both groups have been subjected to similar selective pressures, thus promoting the evolution of analogous features such as a long slender bill and legs, mottled cryptic plumage and characteristic body proportions. While less similar in general morphology, the species that are most closely related to painted-snipes are other members of the suborder Thinocori: jacanas, seedsnipes, and the plains wanderer.

The species †&quot;Rostratula minator&quot; was described in 1988 from deposits of the early Pliocene found in Langebaanweg, South Africa. This is the first fossil attributed to the family Rostratulidae. Comparisons of bone measurements with &quot;R. minator&quot; and the extant species show that it was intermediate in size, although considerable differences indicate that it may only be an endemic African species that has become extinct, rather than a direct ancestor of &quot;R. benghalensis&quot;.

The Australian painted-snipe was described as &quot;Rostratula australis&quot; by John Gould in 1838, although later lumped with the similar greater painted-snipe, &quot;R. benghalensis&quot; as subspecies &quot;R. b. australis&quot;. However, morphological and genetic differences have resulted in the species being restored in recent years. Such a similarity between the two species can be explained by a recent evolutionary divergence, and is an example of allopatric speciation where the prevention of gene flow by geographical isolation has resulted in an accumulation of differences by genetic drift and differing selective pressures.

==Taxonomy==
Family Rostratulidae: painted-snipes

==Behaviour==
All three species of painted-snipe generally inhabit reedy swamps and marshes, usually in lowlands. Outside of the breeding season painted-snipes are generally solitary in habits. Painted snipes are crepuscular or even slightly nocturnal in their habits.

===Feeding===
Painted-snipes are omnivorous, feeding on invertebrates and seeds. Animal prey taken includes annelid worms, snails, aquatic and marsh insects, and crustaceans. The seeds of grasses such as millet and rice are also consumed, and may form a major part of the diet of some populations.

===Breeding===
The breeding biology of the painted-snipes varies according to genus; the &quot;Rostratula&quot; painted-snipes are generally polyandrous whereas the South American painted-snipe is monogamous. The females of the genus &quot;Rostratula&quot; will bond with several males during a breeding season, but once the eggs are laid the males provide all the incubation and parental care. The nest of both species is a shallow cup, often built on a platform of vegetation. Clutch sizes range from 2–4 eggs, which are incubated for 15–21 days.

==Conservation==
At present, two species, the South American and greater painted-snipes, are not considered threatened by human activities; however, the Australian painted-snipe has declined and is considered endangered in Australia.

<text>The People&#x27;s National Party (PNP) is a social democratic political party in Jamaica, founded in 1938 by Norman Washington Manley who served as party president until his death in 1969. It holds 14 of the 63 seats in the House of Representatives, as 96 of the 227 local government divisions. The party is democratic socialist by constitution.

The party is a member of COPPPAL and a full member of Socialist International. From 1957 to 1962, the party was a member of the West Indies Federal Labour Party in the Federal Parliament of the West Indies Federation.

==Colonial Jamaica==
The PNP was founded in 1938 by Norman Washington Manley, and is the second oldest political party in Jamaica (the People&#x27;s Political Party was formed earlier, on 9 September 1929, by Marcus Garvey). It is now one of the country&#x27;s main two political parties, and is considered more to the left than its main rival the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP). The party held a majority of seats in the parliament of the Colony of Jamaica from 1955 until 1962. Following independence in 1962, it held the majority of seats in the Jamaican Parliament from 1972 to 1980, from 1989 to 2007, and from 2011 to 2016.

The PNP was defeated in the first universal elections held in Jamaica in 1944, winning only four of the 32 seats (one elected independent joined the party afterwards). The 1949 Jamaican general election was much closer. The PNP received more votes (203,048) than the JLP (199,538), but the JLP secured more seats; 17 to the PNP&#x27;s 13. Two seats were won by independents. The voter turnout was 65.2%.

In 1954, the PNP expelled Richard Hart, a Marxist, and three other PNP members for their (alleged) communist views. The other three members were Ken Hill, Frank Hill, and Arthur Henry, and they were collectively referred to as &quot;the four Hs&quot;. Under &quot;the four Hs&quot;, the unions they officered had the largest following of any union outside of the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union.

Hart and the other members of &quot;the four Hs&quot; were very active in the trade union movement in Jamaica. In the 1940s and 1950s. Hart worked as a member of the Executive Committee of the Trade Union Council from 1946 to 1948. He served as Assistant Secretary of the Caribbean Labour Congress from 1945 to 1946 and Assistant Secretary from 1947 to 1953.

The expulsion of the &#x27;Four Hs&#x27; signalled a parting of ways between the PNP and the Trade Union Congress (TUC), which was aligned to the PNP. The National Workers Union (NWU) effectively filled the vacuum left by the TUC.

The PNP came to office 1955, and held power until just before independence in 1962. In the 1955 Jamaican general election, the PNP won for the first time, securing 18 out of 32 seats. The JLP ended up with 14 seats, and there were no independents. The voter turnout with 65.1%. As a result, Norman Manley became the new chief minister.

The 1959 Jamaican general election was held on 28 July 1959, and the number of seats was increased to 45. The PNP secured a wider margin of victory, taking 29 seats to the JLP&#x27;s 16.

Manley was appointed Jamaica&#x27;s first premier on 14 August 1959.

During this period of government, it promoted actively reformist social democratic policies, including opening secondary education to many poorer Jamaicans through state funding of scholarships.

In the 1961 Federation membership referendum Jamaica voted 54% to leave the West Indies Federation. After losing the referendum, Manley took Jamaica to the polls in April 1962, to secure a mandate for the island&#x27;s independence. On 10 April 1962, of the 45 seats up for contention in the 1962 Jamaican general election, the JLP won 26 seats and the PNP 19. The voter turnout was 72.9%.

This resulted in the independence of Jamaica on 6 August 1962, and several other British colonies in the West Indies followed suit in the next decade. Bustamante had replaced Manley as premier between April and August, and on independence, he became Jamaica&#x27;s first prime minister.

==Independent Jamaica==
On 21 February, in the 1967 Jamaican general election, the JLP were victorious again, winning 33 out of 53 seats, with the PNP taking 20 seats.

In 1972, under the leadership of Norman Manley&#x27;s son Michael Manley, the PNP returned to office committed to democratic socialism and a foreign policy focused on strengthening relations with the Global South. The PNP won 37 seats to the JLP&#x27;s 16. In the 1976 Jamaican general election, the PNP won another landslide, winning 47 seats to the JLP&#x27;s 13. The turnout was a very high 85 percent.

In 1980, after several years characterised by inflation and rising unemployment, the JLP led by Edward Seaga overwhelmingly defeated the PNP in a campaign noteworthy for its alarming level of violence. The JLP won 51 seats to the PNP&#x27;s nine seats.

Manley led the party in a boycott of the snap election called in 1983. The party was absent from parliament for more than five years. The PNP was returned to office under Manley&#x27;s leadership in 1989, winning 45 seats to the JLP&#x27;s 15.

Manley retired from politics in 1992, and was replaced as party leader by P. J. Patterson. Patterson led the PNP to victory in 1993, 1997, and 2002, becoming the first political leader in Jamaican history to win three successive general elections. In 1993, the PNP won 52 seats to the JLP&#x27;s eight seats, and in 1997 the PNP won 50 of the 60 seats available.

In the 2002 election, held on 16 October 2002, the party won 52.2% of the popular vote and 34 of the 60 seats in the House of Representatives.

On 26 February 2006, Portia Simpson-Miller was elected as Patterson&#x27;s successor, becoming the first female president of the PNP, and became the first female Prime Minister of Jamaica. The PNP lost the August 2007 election to the JLP by a narrow margin of 32 seats to 28, with a turnout of 61.46%. This election ended 18 years of PNP rule, and Bruce Golding became the new prime minister.

In the 29 December 2011 general election, the PNP was returned to power with 42 of the 63 seats in Jamaica&#x27;s parliament. At first, 41 seats were counted in favour of the PNP. A recount with official results cost the former agriculture minister, Christopher Tufton, his seat, putting the PNP at 42 and the JLP at 21. The number of seats had been increased to 63, and the voter turnout was 53.17%.

On 5 January 2012, Portia Simpson-Miller was sworn in as prime minister for the second time in her political career. On the following day, she assigned 20 cabinet ministers to various ministries, and eight state ministers.

In the 2016 Jamaican general election on 25 February, Simpson-Miller lost to Andrew Holness by a narrow margin. A recount granted the PNP an additional seat, resulting in a one-seat loss. The PNP won 31 seats to the JLP&#x27;s 32. As a result, Simpson-Miller became Opposition Leader for a second time. The voter turnout dipped below 50% for the first time, registering just 48.37%.

Following calls from within her own party for her to step down as party leader, Simpson-Miller announced she would not seek re-election on 4 December 2016. She was replaced by Peter Phillips, the Shadow Minister of Finance and former rival, on 26 March 2017. She stepped down as an MP in June 2017.

In the September 2020 general elections, the PNP returned to the opposition benches winning a paltry 14 of the 63 seats in the Jamaican parliament in what was described as a political carnage toppling the hierarchy of the PNP. Many senior and well-established party members lost their seats, including Peter Bunting, Dayton Campbell, Fenton Ferguson, Horace Dalley, Ian Hayles, Luther Buchanan, Wykeham McNeill, Dwayne Vaz and Richard Azan. On 4 September 2020 Peter Phillips announced that he would step down as Opposition Leader and retire from representational politics. The turnout at this election was just 37%, probably affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

On 7 November 2020 the PNP elected Mark Golding as its 6th President after he defeated challenger Lisa Hanna in the 2020 People&#x27;s National Party leadership election by 1,740 votes to 1,444.

<text>Anders Torstenson (20 January 1641 in Stralsund – 8 November 1686 in Stockholm) was a Swedish Privy Councilor, Governor-General and Count.

==Biography==
His father, Lennart Torstensson, was a military officer with the rank of Fältmarskalk (Field Marshal), who was later ennobled as a Count. Out of five children, he was the only one to reach adulthood. Three died as infants and his brother, Gustaf Adolf (1634-1653), was killed in a duel.

He was sent to Uppsala in 1649, to complete his primary education. Three years later, he served as a chamber page for Queen Christina. From 1659 to 1663, he travelled abroad. Upon his return, he became a lieutenant in the Svea Life Guards, and was promoted to captain the following year.

In 1665, he married Countess Christina Catharina Stenbock (1649–1719), the daughter of Admiral Gustaf Otto Stenbock. They had fifteen children; eight girls and seven boys, most of whom died prematurely. His namesake son, , a colonel, was killed at the Battle of Poltava. His next-to-last child, also became a colonel, with the Närke-Värmland Regiment, and died suddenly, while on a trip to visit the spa in Aachen.

He was promoted to colonel in 1667, and received an appointment as &quot;Master of the Horse&quot;. In 1673, he became a member of the Riksråd (Council of the Realm, or Privy Council). He had served for only a year when he resigned, to become the first Governor-General of Estland, part of the Swedish province of Livonia. He held that post until 1681.

In 1684, he was appointed President of the , an appellate court in what is now Finland. Due to an illness, he never took up his duties. He died two years later.

<doc id="205735" wikidata="Q1954743" url="?curid=205735" title="Museum of Anthropology at UBC">
<text>The Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia (UBC) campus in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada displays world arts and cultures, in particular works by First Nations of the Pacific Northwest. As well as being a major tourist destination, MOA is a research and teaching museum, where UBC courses in art, anthropology, archaeology, conservation, and museum studies are given. MOA houses close to 50,000 ethnographic objects, as well as 535,000 archaeological objects in its building alone.

==History==
The Museum&#x27;s beginnings lie in the University of British Columbia&#x27;s acquisition of the Frank Burnett Collection in 1927. These works, in addition to two important Musqueam house posts that were acquired and donated by the UBC graduating class of 1927, a number of salvaged totem poles acquired from Canadian anthropologist Marius Barbeau, and the Buttimer collection of First Nations basketry, were displayed in the basement of the UBC Main Library. The museum was officially founded in 1947. Harry Hawthorn served as the first director of the new museum, with his wife, Audrey Hawthorn, serving as its first curator.

In 1971, the museum received funds from the Government of Canada and UBC to begin construction of a building. In 1976, the new building, designed by renowned Canadian architect Arthur Erickson, opened under new director Michael M. Ames, who served from 1974 to 1997. Walter and Marianne Koerner&#x27;s 1975 donation of their extensive collection of Northwest Coast First Nations art to the museum formed a large part of the building&#x27;s contents.

In 1997, Ruth Phillips became museum director. In 2002, Ames returned as acting director. Anthony Shelton was director from 2004 until 2021. In 2021, Susan Rowley, a long-time curator at the museum, was appointed director for a three-year term.

On March 9, 1999, Canada Post issued a stamp commemorating the Museum, designed by Barbara Hodgson, based on photographs by William McLennan and Jacqueline Gijssen, and prominently featuring the sculpture &quot;The Raven and the First Men&quot; by Bill Reid. The 46¢ stamps are perforated 13.5 and were printed by the Canadian Bank Note Company.

In 2022, the Museum was closed for 18 months for seismic upgrade and was reopened on June 13, 2024.

==Building==
The museum is located at 6393 NW Marine Dr, on the campus of the University of British Columbia. MOA and UBC lie in the Point Grey campus lands, which are not officially part of the City of Vancouver. The Arthur Erickson&#x27;s building was designed in 1976, inspired by the post-and-beam architecture of northern Northwest Coast First Nations people. Like much of Erickson&#x27;s work, the building is made primarily out of concrete. The building takes advantage of second world war gun emplacements, with the Bill Reid Raven sculpture located on a repurposed gun battery.

In 2006, the museum launched a project to create a new research wing, as well as new offices, laboratories, a &#x27;culturally sensitive research room&#x27;, recording studio, and a exhibition hall, the Audain Gallery. Other enhancements included MOA&#x27;s new Multiversity Galleries, the creation of the RRN (Reciprocal Research Network) linking Northwest Coast collections around the world, a relocated and expanded Museum Shop, year-round cafe, and courtyard and outdoor &#x27;events pad&#x27; suitable for facility rentals. The project was completed in January 2010. Budgeted at $55.5 million, the Renewal Project received $34.4 million in funding from the Canada Foundation for Innovation and British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund ($17.2 million each), the University of British Columbia, UBC Faculty of Arts, and the museum itself. In 2009, MOA received a major gift of $5.5 million from the Koerner Foundation, Toronto, towards the project.

In September 2010, a reflecting pool was added to the front, funded by Yosef Wosk, OBC. Arthur Erickson and landscape architect Cornelia Oberlander originally intended the pool to be opened as part of the new Museum of Anthropology in 1976; now, nearly 35 years later, their original vision for MOA has been fulfilled. Pools had been installed temporarily three times in MOA&#x27;s history: for a movie shoot in 1993, for the APEC leaders’ summit in 1997, and to celebrate Arthur Erickson&#x27;s 80th birthday in June 2004.

In November 2020, the museum began a seismic upgrade project to rebuild its Great Hall in order to upgrade its resiliency and protect its collection in the event of a major earthquake. The Museum reopened on June 13, 2024. 

==Galleries==
The O&#x27;Brian and Audain galleries are used for temporary exhibitions.

=== Elspeth McConnell Gallery of Northwest Coast Masterworks ===
The Elspeth McConnell Gallery of Northwest Coast Masterworks was unveiled on June 22, 2017. Designed by Stantec Architecture, the new gallery was converted from the former Michael M. Ames Theatre, and was funded by Montreal-based collector Elspeth McConnell, a $3-million donation from the Doggone Foundation, and a $500,000 grant from the federal government as part of the Canada 150 Community Infrastructure Program. The 210-square-metre gallery features exterior sensors that synchronize both the colour temperature and intensity of the interior light with the changing light conditions outside.

&quot;In a Different Light: Reflecting on Northwest Coast Art&quot; was the first exhibition held at the gallery.

===Koerner European Ceramics Gallery===
The Koerner European Ceramics Gallery opened in 1990 and contains over 600 European ceramics collected by Koerner, which he donated to the museum in 1987.

===Multiversity Galleries===
The Multiversity Galleries housing more than 9,000 objects from around the world. Multiversity Galleries showcases items from the museum&#x27;s collection that would normally be stored.

== Collection ==

The Museum of Anthropology includes a number of large sculptures, totem poles, and cultural artifacts. Although MOA&#x27;s focus is on the First Nations of the Northwest Coast, the collection of close to 50,000 ethnological objects includes objects from all continents. The collections include contemporary works as well as historical objects. In addition to the ethnographic collections, MOA houses an archaeological collection of approximately 535,000 pieces. These are managed by UBC&#x27;s Laboratory of Archaeology. The museum also has a small wing dedicated to European ceramic art works collected by the late Walter Koerner.

The yellow cedar sculpture &quot;The Raven and the First Men&quot; by Bill Reid was depicted on the Canadian twenty-dollar bill from 2004 to 2012 (the Canadian Journey Series). Other notable Bill Reid works include his &quot;Bear&quot; and &quot;Wasco&quot; (Sea Wolf) sculptures, some of his gold jewellery, and a prototype of the Haida dugout canoe he carved for Expo 86.

There are several large Musqueam artifacts in the museum from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as well as many contemporary works commissioned from Musqueam artists such as Susan Point, Joe Becker, and Robyn and Debra Sparrow. There are many fragments of totem poles from Haida and other First Nations villages along British Columbia&#x27;s coast in the museum&#x27;s Great Hall.

There is an extensive collection from the South Pacific in the MOA.

There are about 6000 textiles in the collection; about half of these come from Asia. Of particular note are the Cantonese opera costumes that are considered some of the world&#x27;s finest. There are holdings from the Northwest Coast, Oceania, Africa, and South America.

The Audrey &amp; Harry Hawthorn Library and Archives is open to the public. The archives contain approximately 90,000 photographs that cover a wide range of cultures, ethnographic subjects, and historical events. The collection dates from the 1890s.

There are approximately 2800 belongings in the African collection. The earlier collections came to MOA via missionaries, travelers, and ex-colonial officers. The collection includes masks, Yoruba thorn carvings, over 100 Makonde figures from Tanzania, approximately 100 Asante gold weights, weaponry from South Africa and about 100 mortuary objects from Egypt.

About 40% of MOA&#x27;s collection is from Asia. The Chinese collections include between 1000 and 1500 pieces of Chinese ceramics, Chinese calligraphy, and paintings (with four recently identified masterpieces from the collection of Ho Ping-ti). In addition, there is a large collection of Japanese prints, Buddhist art, Hindu art (including Gandhara sculpture), textiles and clothing, and Indian calendar prints. Other collections include 2300 Chinese coins and amulets, 200 Sichuan blue thread embroideries dating to circa 1900, rare Tibetan robes, and masks from Noe (Japan), Sunni and Kolam (Sri Lanka), and Pongsan and Yangju (Korea).

The Haida houses outside the museum were built under the direction of Bill Reid, who carved, with Doug Cranmer, many of the totem poles surrounding them. The original Reid/Cranmer totem pole mounted on the front of the big house was taken inside in 2000 due to deterioration and replaced with the new &quot;Respect to Bill Reid Pole&quot; by Haida artist Jim Hart.
== Programs ==
The Museum of Anthropology works with the Irving K. Barber Learning Centre and others to support the Indigitization program, which provides funding and training for Indigenous communities and organizations to digitize cultural heritage materials. Each summer, MOA hosts the Native Youth Program (NYP), the longest running training program for Indigenous high school students in British Columbia. It provides summer employment and training to six urban Indigenous high school students and two UBC students as program manager and research assistant. NYP is co-organized by MOA and the First Nation House of Learning at UBC.

==Affiliations==
The museum is affiliated with Canadian Heritage Information Network, Canadian Museums Association, and Virtual Museum of Canada.

==In popular culture==
The Museum of Anthropology was used as a filming location for the Netflix TV Series, &quot;Altered Carbon&quot; in season 1.

It is also used as a location in the movie Intersection, starring Richard Gere.

<text>Pacific Spirit Regional Park is a park located in Point Grey to the west of the city of Vancouver, British Columbia. Located in Electoral Area A, it surrounds the University of British Columbia Vancouver campus on the shores of Georgia Strait in the Pacific Ocean. Most of Pacific Spirit Park is in the University Endowment Lands, though a portion of the shoreline around Wreck Beach is not part of any organized local government.

Pacific Spirit Park was formerly owned by the British Columbia government, which in 1989 transferred the lands to Metro Vancouver to operate as a park. 

The park contains over 55 km of walking/hiking trails, 34 km of which are designated multi-use and available for cycling and horseback riding as well. There is a Park Centre which is located on W 16th Avenue.

In 1975, BC Parks established ninety hectares of Pacific Spirit Regional Park as the UBC Endowment Lands Ecological Reserve. This area is designated for forest research, and is not open to the public.

<doc id="205740" wikidata="Q953108" url="?curid=205740" title="SAVAK">
<text>The Bureau for Intelligence and Security of the State (), shortened to as SAVAK () or S.A.V.A.K. () was the secret police of the Imperial State of Iran. It was established in Tehran in 1957 by national security law. and continued to operate until the Islamic Revolution in 1979, when it was dissolved by Iranian prime minister Shapour Bakhtiar.

At peak, there were around 5,000 SAVAK agents operating under the Pahlavi dynasty. Iranian-American scholar and ex-politician Gholam Reza Afkhami estimates that SAVAK had between 4,000 and 6,000 members, while &quot;TIME&quot; stated in a publication on 19 February 1979 that the agency had 5,000 members.

== History ==

=== 1957–1971 ===
After the 1953 Iranian coup d&#x27;état, Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq was removed. He was originally focused on nationalizing Iran&#x27;s oil industry but had also set out to weaken the Shah&#x27;s power. After the coup, the monarch, Mohammad Reza Shah, established an intelligence service with police powers. The Shah&#x27;s goal was to strengthen his regime by placing political opponents under surveillance and repressing dissident movements. According to &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;:

In March 1955, the Army colonel was &quot;replaced with a more permanent team of five career Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officers, including specialists in covert operations, intelligence analysis, and counterintelligence, including Major General Herbert Norman Schwarzkopf who &quot;trained virtually all of the first generation of SAVAK personnel&quot;. In October 1956, news of the intended establishment of an agency was reported by state media and in 1965, this agency was reorganized and given the name &quot;Sazeman-e Ettela&#x27;at va Amniyat-e Keshvar&quot; (SAVAK). These in turn were replaced by SAVAK&#x27;s own instructors in 1965.

SAVAK had the power to censor the media, screen applicants for government jobs, and &quot;according to reliable Western source, use all means necessary, including torture, to hunt down dissidents&quot;. After 1963, the Shah expanded his security organizations, including SAVAK, which grew to over 5,300 full-time agents and a large but unknown number of part-time informers.

In 1961 the Iranian authorities dismissed the agency&#x27;s first director, General Teymur Bakhtiar, and he later became a political dissident. In 1970, SAVAK agents assassinated him, disguising the deed as an accident.

General Hassan Pakravan, director of SAVAK from 1961 to 1966, had an almost benevolent reputation, for example dining on a weekly basis with Ayatollah Khomeini while Khomeini was under house arrest, and later intervened to prevent Khomeini&#x27;s execution on the grounds that it would &quot;anger the common people of Iran&quot;. After the Iranian Revolution, however, Pakravan was among the first of the Shah&#x27;s officials to be executed by the Khomeini regime.

Pakravan was replaced in 1966 by General Nematollah Nassiri, a close associate of the Shah, and the service was reorganized and became increasingly active in the face of rising leftist and Islamist militancy and political unrest.

===Siahkal attack and after===
A turning point in SAVAK&#x27;s reputation for ruthless brutality was reportedly an attack on a gendarmerie post in the Caspian village of Siahkal by a small band of armed Marxists in February 1971, although it is also reported to have tortured to death a Shia cleric, Ayatollah Muhammad Reza Sa&#x27;idi, in 1970. According to Iranian political historian Ervand Abrahamian, after this attack SAVAK interrogators were sent abroad for &quot;scientific training to prevent unwanted deaths from &#x27;brute force.&#x27;&quot; Brute force was supplemented with the bastinado; sleep deprivation; extensive solitary confinement; glaring searchlights; standing in one place for hours on end; nail extractions; snakes (favored for use with women); electrical shocks with cattle prods, often into the rectum; cigarette burns; sitting on hot grills; acid dripped into nostrils; near-drownings; mock executions; and an electric chair with a large metal mask to muffle screams while amplifying them for the victim. This latter contraption was dubbed the Apollo—an allusion to the American spacecraft of the same name. Prisoners were also humiliated by being raped, urinated on, and forced to stand naked. Despite the new &#x27;scientific&#x27; methods, the torture of choice remained the traditional bastinado used to beat soles of the feet. The &quot;primary goal&quot; of those using the bastinados &quot;was to locate arms caches, safe houses and accomplices ...&quot;

Abrahamian estimates that SAVAK (and other police and military) killed 368 guerrillas including the leadership of the major urban guerrilla organizations (Organization of Iranian People&#x27;s Fedai Guerrillas, People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran) such as Hamid Ashraf between 1971–1977 and executed up to 100 political prisoners between 1971 and 1979—the most violent era of the SAVAK&#x27;s existence.

The repression was softened thanks to publicity and scrutiny by &quot;numerous international organizations and foreign newspapers.&quot; Jimmy Carter became president of the United States and he raised the issue of human rights in the Imperial State of Iran. Overnight prison conditions changed. Inmates dubbed this the dawn of &quot;jimmykrasy&quot;.

== Directors ==



== Number of employees ==
Over the years, the question of the number of employees of SAVAK has been the subject of debate by many historians and researchers. Given the fact that Iran has never disclosed data on the number of employees of the secret agency - many historians gave conflicting figures for the number of SAVAK personnel - 6,000, 20,000, 30,000 and 60,000.

In one of his interviews, on February 4, 1974, the Shah stated that he did not know the exact number of employees of SAVAK. However, he estimated their total number to be less than 2,000 employees. To the frequently asked question about “torture and atrocities” in SAVAK, the shah answered negatively, designating newspaper reports about the “arbitrariness and cruelty of SAVAK” as a lie and slander. Leaflets circulated after the Islamic Revolution indicated that 15,000 Iranians officially served in SAVAK, not to mention the many unofficial employees.

== Operations ==
During the height of its power, SAVAK had virtually unlimited powers. It operated its own detention centers, such as Evin Prison. In addition to domestic security, the service&#x27;s tasks extended to the surveillance of Iranians abroad, notably in the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, and especially students on government stipends. The agency also closely collaborated with the CIA by sending their agents to an air force base in New York to share and discuss interrogation tactics.

Teymur Bakhtiar was assassinated by SAVAK agents in 1970, and Mansur Rafizadeh, SAVAK&#x27;s United States director during the 1970s, reported that General Nassiri&#x27;s phone was tapped. Mansur Rafizadeh later wrote of his life as a SAVAK man and detailed the human rights violations of the Shah in his book &quot;Witness: From the Shah to the Secret Arms Deal: An Insider&#x27;s Account of U.S. Involvement in Iran&quot;. Mansur Rafizadeh was suspected to have been a double agent also working for the CIA.

SAVAK was additionally involved in supporting Jamiat-e Islami militants during the 1975 Panjshir Valley uprising and 1975 Laghman uprising in the Republic of Afghanistan, in collaboration with the CIA and the Pakistani ISI, although Afghan–Iranian relations later improved in 1976 under Mohammad Daoud Khan. Two days before the Saur Revolution in 1978, the KGB were informed of the coup by Afghan Army leaders Mohammed Rafie and Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy. As a result, the KGB mistakenly informed its operatives in Kabul that SAVAK tricked the PDPA into starting a rebellion, expecting it to be crushed and for the rebels to fail.

According to Polish author Ryszard Kapuściński, SAVAK was responsible for: Censorship of press, books, and films; Interrogation and often torture of prisoners; and Surveillance of political opponents.

==Victims==
Writing at the time of the Shah&#x27;s overthrow, &quot;Time&quot; magazine on February 19, 1979, described SAVAK as having &quot;long been Iran&#x27;s most hated and feared institution&quot; which had &quot;tortured and murdered thousands of the Shah&#x27;s opponents&quot;. The Federation of American Scientists also found it guilty of &quot;the torture and execution of thousands of political prisoners&quot; and symbolising &quot;the Shah&#x27;s rule from 1963–79.&quot; The FAS list of SAVAK torture methods included &quot;electric shock, whipping, beating, inserting broken glass and pouring boiling water into the rectum, tying weights to the testicles, and the extraction of teeth and nails&quot;.

== Fardoust and security and intelligence after the revolution ==
SAVAK was closed down shortly before the overthrow of the monarchy and the coming to power of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the February 1979 Iranian Revolution. Following the departure of the Shah in January 1979, SAVAK&#x27;s more than 3,000 strong central staff and its agents were targeted for reprisals. However, it is believed that Khomeini may have changed his mind and may have retained them into the new SAVAMA. Hossein Fardoust, a former classmate of the Shah, was a deputy director of SAVAK until he was appointed head of the Imperial Inspectorate, also known as the Special Intelligence Bureau, to watch over high-level government officials, including SAVAK directors. Fardoust later switched sides during the revolution and managed to salvage the bulk of the SAVAK organization. According to author Charles Kurzman, SAVAK was never dismantled but rather changed its name and leadership and continued on with the same codes of operation, and a relatively unchanged &quot;staff.&quot;

SAVAK was replaced by the &quot;much larger&quot; SAVAMA, &quot;Sazman-e Ettela&#x27;at va Amniat-e Melli-e Iran&quot;, also known as the Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran. After the Iranian Revolution, a museum was opened in the former Towhid Prison in central Tehran called &quot;Ebrat&quot;. The museum displays and exhibits the documented atrocities of SAVAK.

<text>The glaucophytes, also known as glaucocystophytes or glaucocystids, are a small group of unicellular algae found in freshwater and moist terrestrial environments, less common today than they were during the Proterozoic. The stated number of species in the group varies from about 14 to 26. Together with the red algae (Rhodophyta) and the green algae plus land plants (Viridiplantae or Chloroplastida), they form the Archaeplastida. 

The glaucophytes are of interest to biologists studying the evolution of chloroplasts as they may be similar to the original algal type that led to the red algae and green plants, i.e. glaucophytes may be basal Archaeplastida.

Unlike red and green algae, glaucophytes only have asexual reproduction.

==Characteristics==
The plastids of glaucophytes are known as &#x27;muroplasts&#x27;, &#x27;cyanoplasts&#x27;, or &#x27;cyanelles&#x27;. Unlike the plastids in other organisms, they have a peptidoglycan layer, believed to be a relic of the endosymbiotic origin of plastids from cyanobacteria. Glaucophytes contain the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll a. Along with red algae and cyanobacteria, they harvest light via phycobilisomes, structures consisting largely of phycobiliproteins. The green algae and land plants have lost that pigment. Like red algae, and in contrast to green algae and plants, glaucophytes store fixed carbon in the cytosol.

The most early-diverging genus is &quot;Cyanophora&quot;, which only has one or two plastids. When there are two, they are semi-connected.

Glaucophytes have mitochondria with flat cristae, and undergo open mitosis without centrioles. Motile forms have two unequal flagella, which may have fine hairs and are anchored by a multilayered system of microtubules, both of which are similar to forms found in some green algae.


== Phylogeny ==

=== External ===

Together with red algae and Viridiplantae (green algae and land plants), glaucophytes form the Archaeplastida – a group of plastid-containing organisms that may share a unique common ancestor that established an endosymbiotic association with a cyanobacterium. The relationship among the three groups remains uncertain, although it is most likely that glaucophytes diverged first:

The alternative, that glaucophytes and red algae form a clade, has been shown to be less plausible, but cannot be ruled out.

=== Internal ===

The internal phylogeny of the glaucophytes and the number of genera and species varies considerably among taxonomic sources. A phylogeny of the Glaucophyta published in 2017 divided the group into three families, and includes five genera:
=== Taxonomy ===

A 2019 list of the described glaucophyte species has the same three subdivisions, treated as orders, but includes a further five unplaced possible species, producing a total of between 14 and 19 possible species.
*Order Cyanophorales
**Genus &quot;Cyanophora&quot; – 5–6 species
*Order Glaucocystales
**Genus &quot;Glaucocystis&quot; – 7–8 species
*Order Gloeochaetales
**&quot;Cyanoptyche&quot; – 1 species
**&quot;Gloeochaete&quot; – 1 species
*Other possible species 
**?&quot;Archaeopsis monococca&quot; 
**?&quot;Chalarodora azurea&quot; 
**?&quot;Glaucocystopsis africana&quot; 
**?&quot;Peliaina cyanea&quot; 
**?&quot;Strobilomonas cyaneus&quot; 

, AlgaeBase divided glaucophytes into only two groups, placing &quot;Cyanophora&quot; in Glaucocystales rather than Cyanophorales (however the entry was dated 2011). AlgaeBase included a total of 26 species in nine genera:
*Glaucocystales
**&quot;Chalarodora&quot; – 1 species
**&quot;Corynoplastis&quot; – 1 species
**&quot;Cyanophora&quot; – 6 species
**&quot;Glaucocystis&quot; – 13 species
**&quot;Glaucocystopsis&quot; – 1 species
**&quot;Peliaina&quot; – 1 species
**&quot;Strobilomonas&quot; – 1 species
*Gloeochaetales
**&quot;Cyanoptyche&quot; – 1 species
**&quot;Gloeochaete&quot; – 1 species

None of the species of Glaucophyta is particularly common in nature. 

The glaucophytes were considered before as part of family Oocystaceae, in the order Chlorococcales.

<text>Childwickbury Manor is a manor house in the hamlet of Childwickbury, Hertfordshire, England, between St Albans and Harpenden.

==History==
The Lomax family bought the house in 1666 and lived there until 1854 when Joshua Lomax sold it to Henry Hayman Toulmin, a wealthy ship owner, High Sheriff of Hertfordshire and mayor of St Albans. Toulmin left the property to Sir John Blundell Maple around 20 years later. Toulmin&#x27;s granddaughter, the author Mary Carbery, was born at the house.

Sir John Blundell Maple, 1st Baronet bred and raced thoroughbreds and built Childwickbury Stud into a very successful horse breeding operation. Another prominent racehorse owner, Jack Barnato Joel, bought the estate including the stud farm in 1906. On his death in 1940, his son Jim Joel took over the operation. He too became a successful racehorse owner and breeder and maintained the property until 1978 when the stud and the manor were sold separately.

It was advertised thus:

&quot;The Manor House, mainly 18th century has 12 Reception Rooms, 18 Bed and Dressing Rooms, 11 Staff Bedrooms, and 10 Bathrooms. Immaculate Timbered Grounds. Walled Garden. Courtyard with Garaging and Flat. Estate Office. Victorian Dairy House with about 19 Acres [77,000 m2]. Two Coach House Cottages with Magnificent Stable Yard with Paddock and Woodland 16 Acres [65,000 m2]. Cheapside and Shafford Farms, 2 Well Equipped Corn and Stock Farms with about 724 Acres [2.9 km2]. 146 Acres [591,000 m2] of Timbered Parkland, 37 Acres [150,000 m2] of Railed Paddock and 104 Acres [421,000 m2] of valuable Commercial Timber&quot;. In addition there were &quot;18 Attractive Houses and Cottages, some with Paddocks. Old Mill and other Buildings for conversion, Stud Buildings, 30 Loose Boxes, Potential Riding School, and fishing in River Ver and Mill Race. Total 1,100 Acres [4.5 km2]&quot;

The stud was sold to the Marquesa de Moratalla. 

===Current owner===
Film director Stanley Kubrick bought the manor in 1978. He used the estate as both a home and a nerve centre for his film productions. He lived there until his death in 1999 and is interred in its grounds together with his eldest daughter Anya Kubrick, who died in 2009. His widow, Christiane Kubrick, still lives in the Manor House.

<text>Eino Leino (born Armas Einar Leopold Lönnbohm; 6 July 1878 – 10 January 1926) was a Finnish poet and journalist who is considered one of the pioneers of Finnish poetry and a national poet of Finland. His poems combine modern and Finnish folk elements. Much of his work is in the style of the &quot;Kalevala&quot; and folk songs in general. Nature, love, and despair are frequent themes in Leino&#x27;s work. He is beloved and widely read in Finland today.

Leino&#x27;s birthday on 6 July was named Eino Leino Day (&quot;Eino Leinon päivä&quot;) as well as day of Finnish poetry and summer in 1992, and it is an established Finnish flag day.

==Early life==
Eino Leino was baptized as Armas Einar Leopold Lönnbohm in Paltamo as the seventh and youngest son in a family of ten children. Leino&#x27;s family lived in the Hövelö house in Paltaniemi village. Leino&#x27;s father had changed his name from &quot;Antti Mustonen&quot; to &quot;Anders Lönnbohm&quot; to improve his chances of marrying his future upper-class wife, Anna Emilia Kyrenius. Eino&#x27;s older brother Kasimir Leino was an important cultural figure in Finland. He was a poet, critic, and theatre director. Eino and Kasimir Leino founded a literature journal together in 1898.

Leino published his first poem at the age of 12 and a collection of poems, &quot;Maaliskuun lauluja&quot;, at 18.

Leino&#x27;s parents died while he was still in school. He started school in Kajaani and continued in Oulu and Hämeenlinna, where he boarded with relatives. After graduating from the Hämeenlinna secondary school, Leino started studying at the University of Helsinki.

==Writing career==

Early in his career Eino Leino was much loved and praised by the critics. He joined literary and newspaper circles and became a member of the Young Finnish circle. Among Leino&#x27;s friends were the artist Pekka Halonen and Otto Manninen, who gained fame as a poet and translator.

As early as November 1917, Eino Leino had annoyedly warned in the &quot;Sunnuntai&quot; magazine that the country was &quot;on the brink of civil war,&quot; and fiercely criticized the Socialists as they set out to &quot;pursue their cause with civil blood and the stings of a foreign conqueror&quot; (No. 40-41 / 1917). The political situation, which escalated into the Finnish Civil War, was a bitter experience for Leino, who had always written for tolerance and also appreciated the labor movement from which he had good friends. Leino experienced the events of the spring of 1918 in the Red-conquered Helsinki, and he described his experiences in the report novel &quot;The Conquest of Helsinki&quot; (1918). He greeted the German Baltic Sea Division, which had invaded southern Finland and conquered Helsinki, as a liberator. But on the other hand, Leino later drove a general amnesty for Red Side line men and women in prisons and demanded the abolition of the death penalty. In April 1918, Leino&#x27;s six-part series of articles called &quot;For the Finnish Workers&quot; was published in the Social Democratic magazine &quot;Työn valta&quot; (&quot;Power of Labor&quot;), in which he, as an impartial writer belonging to the &quot;civilized poverty&quot;, strongly appealed for peace and mutual understanding. “Social democracy would no longer have a future in Finland unless it was able to internalize the &quot;eternal ideals&quot; of legitimacy, democracy and civil liberty,” he wrote.

After the Finnish Civil War, Leino&#x27;s idealistic faith for national unity collapsed, and his influence as a journalist and polemicist weakened. He was granted a State writer&#x27;s pension in 1918 at the age of forty. Although publishing prolifically, he had financial problems and his health deteriorated. &quot;Life is always a struggle with eternal forces,&quot; Leino said in a letter in 1925 to his friend Bertel Gripenberg.

Leino published over 70 books of poems and stories. The most famous of these are the two poem collections &quot;Helkavirsiä&quot; (1903 and 1916), in which he extensively uses Finnish mythology and folklore.

In addition to writing poetry, Eino Leino wrote in newspapers about theatre and culture in general, and translated works of important writers such as Runeberg and Goethe. He was the first person in Finland to translate Dante&#x27;s Divine Comedy into Finnish.

In the summer of 1921, Leino traveled to Estonia for a written tour organized by the Finnish-Estonian friends Aino and Gustav Suits. With his poetry evenings, presentations and celebrations in Tartu and Tallinn, the trip became a success, and Eino Leino was received everywhere as a significant poet. After his trip to Estonia, he signed his third marriage to bank clerk Hanna Laitinen. The desperate attempt to gain support and security ended almost immediately in the separation of the spouses. In 1921, Leino applied for exemption from Finnish citizenship. He wrote letters to President K. J. Ståhlberg and Estonian Head of State Konstantin Päts asking to become an Estonian citizen. Leino was tired of the lack of scholarships and the criticism he received.

Leino was married three times and had one daughter, Helka. He died in 1926 at the age of 47 and later he was buried at the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki. Already at that time as a famous man, he was buried at the expense of the state, and the funeral was attended by President L. K. Relander and other statesmen of the country.

The most detailed biography of Leino was written in 1930s by his lover and colleague L. Onerva. In the dramatic story Onerva is also writing about her own life.

There is no absolute certainty about the cause of Eino Leino&#x27;s death. In the work of the writer Hannu Mäkelä, &quot;Mestari&quot;, the cause of Leino&#x27;s death is described as advanced spinal cord disease and calcification of blood vessels, which is why blood had leaked into the brain. It is said that it had previously confused Leino&#x27;s abdominal functions. According to Mäkelä, the cause of death was determined by both Dr. Wasastjerna and Dr. Lindén. On the other hand, the cause of Leino&#x27;s death has also been suggested to be syphilis by Leino&#x27;s personal doctor Väinö Lindén on the basis of L. Onerva&#x27;s biographical margin.

== Literary style and importance ==

Leino is held to be the first and most important shaper of national romanticism in Finnish literature. Actually, Leino coined the term &quot;national neoromantism&quot; by himself to characterize the works by talents of young Finland such as composer Jean Sibelius, painter Akseli Gallen-Kallela and architect Eliel Saarinen.

Leino&#x27;s style developed during his 35 year career. In his early works, including his most famous collection Helkavirsiä (1903) influence of the national epic Kalevala is visible.
In the middle of his career Leino translated classics of world literature to Finnish. At the same time he wrote his own works in several genres: poetry, plays, essays, reviews and other pieces of journalism. His work encompasses a wide emotional range, anything from profound love to misanthropy and biting criticism.

In his last years, after struggles in his personal life, Leino returned to the national romantic themes of his youth.

== Musical settings ==
As a major Finnish poet, Eino Leino has been profusely set to music by composers of his country, up to our day.

* Toivo Kuula has set a total of 22 Leino poems, including the second of his &quot;Three Songs&quot; op. 2 (&quot;Tuijotin tulehen kauan&quot;, Long have I stared into the fire, 1907) and his cantata for baritone, chorus and orchestra &quot;Kuolemattomuuden toivo&quot; op. 15 (Hope for Immortality, 1910).
* Leevi Madetoja&#x27;s output contains multiple Leino settings, from the incidental music for Leino&#x27;s play &quot;Chess&quot; in 1910 to the use of his poetry in one of his last works, the &quot;Choir Songs&quot; for male choir op. 81 (1945–46).
* Oskar Merikanto has also used Leino&#x27;s poetry as material for over twenty of his art songs. (See his work catalogue.)
* Jean Sibelius has, relatively to the composers above, set few of Leino&#x27;s texts, but one such is the major cantata for mixed choir &quot;Maan virsi&quot; op. 95 (Hymn of the Earth).
* Aarre Merikanto&#x27;s Leino settings include the choir works &quot;Juhannus&quot; (Midsummer, 1946) and &quot;Ukri&quot; (1938/43).
* Jorma Panula&#x27;s &quot;Juhana Herttuan ja Catharina Jagellonican lauluja&quot; (Songs of Duke John and Catherine Jagiellon, 1977) is an extensive setting of Leino&#x27;s collection of the same name.
* Olli Mustonen&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonia No. 1&quot; for baritone and orchestra (2011) draws on Leino&#x27;s collection &quot;Helkavirsiä&quot;.
* Kaija Saariaho&#x27;s song cycle &quot;Leino Songs&quot; (2000-2007) is a setting a four poems by Leino handpicked from different collections. The cycle&#x27;s original version for soprano and piano was premiered in 2007, followed by an orchestrated version the next year.

<doc id="205751" wikidata="Q1250849" url="?curid=205751" title="Pākehā">
<text>Pākehā (or Pakeha; ; ) is a Māori-language word used in English, particularly in New Zealand. It generally means a non-Polynesian New Zealander or more specifically a European New Zealander. It is not a legal term and has no definition under New Zealand law. Papa&#x27;a has a similar meaning in Cook Islands Māori.

==Etymology and history==
The etymology of is uncertain. The most likely sources are the Māori words or , which refer to an oral tale of a &quot;mythical, human like being, with fair skin and hair who possessed canoes made of reeds which changed magically into sailing vessels&quot;. When Europeans first arrived they rowed to shore in longboats, facing backwards. In traditional Māori canoes or , paddlers face the direction of travel. This is supposed to have led to the belief that the sailors were supernatural beings.

There have been several dubious interpretations given to the word . One claims that it derives from , the Māori word for pig, and , one of the Māori words for flea, and therefore expresses derogatory implications. There is no etymological support for this notion—like all Polynesian languages, Māori is generally very conservative in terms of vowels; it would be extremely unusual for &quot;pā-&quot; to derive from &quot;&quot;. The word itself may come from the proto-Polynesian root &quot;puaka&quot;, known in every Polynesian language ( in Tongan, Uvean, Futunian, Rapa, Marquisian, Niuean, Rarotongan, Tokelauan, and Tuvaluan; it evolved to the later form in Samoan, Tahitian, some Rapa dialects, and Hawaiian); or it might be borrowed or mixed with the English &#x27;porker&#x27;. It is hard to say, since Polynesian peoples populated their islands bringing pigs with them from East Asia, but did not bring pigs to New Zealand. The more common Māori word for flea is . It is also sometimes claimed that means &#x27;white pig&#x27; or &#x27;unwelcome white stranger&#x27;. However, no part of the word signifies &#x27;pig&#x27;, &#x27;white&#x27;, &#x27;unwelcome&#x27;, or &#x27;stranger&#x27;.

The term was in use by the late 18th century. In December 1814, the Māori children at Rangihoua in the Bay of Islands were &quot;no less eager to see the &quot;packaha&quot; than the grown folks&quot;.

==Meaning and use==
The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English&quot; (2011) defines &#x27;Pakeha&#x27; as &#x27;a white New Zealander&#x27;. &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of New Zealandisms&quot; (2010) defines the noun Pākehā as &#x27;a light-skinned non-Polynesian New Zealander, especially one of British birth or ancestry as distinct from a Māori; a European or white person&#x27;; and the adjective as &#x27;of or relating to Pākehā; non-Māori; European, white&#x27;.

Māori in the Bay of Islands and surrounding districts had no doubts about the meaning of the word in the 19th century. In 1831, thirteen from the Far North met at Kerikeri to compose a letter to King William IV, seeking protection from the French, &quot;the tribe of Marion&quot;. Written in Māori, the letter used the word &quot;&quot; to mean &#x27;British European&#x27;, and the words to mean &#x27;strangers (non-British)&#x27;—as shown in the translation that year of the letter from Māori to English by the missionary William Yate. To this day, the Māori term for the English language is . Māori also used other terms such as (supernatural, or object of fear, strange being), (ghosts), and (metal or referring to persons foreign) to refer to some of the earliest visitors.

However, &quot;The Concise Māori Dictionary&quot; (Kāretu, 1990) defines the word as &#x27;foreign, foreigner (usually applied to white person)&#x27;, while the &quot;English–Māori, Māori–English Dictionary&quot; (Biggs, 1990) defines it as &#x27;white (person)&#x27;. Sometimes the term applies more widely to include all non-Māori. No Māori dictionary cites as derogatory. Some early European settlers who lived among Māori and adopted aspects of Māoritanga became known as &#x27;Pākehā Māori&#x27;.

In Māori, plural noun-phrases of the term include (the definite article) and (the indefinite article). When the word was first adopted into English, the usual plural was &#x27;Pakehas&#x27;. However, speakers of New Zealand English are increasingly removing the terminal &#x27;s&#x27; and treating the term as a collective noun.

==Attitudes to the term==
A survey of 6,507 New Zealanders in 2009 showed no support for the claim that it is associated with a negative evaluation; however, some reject it on the ground that they claim it is offensive, or they object to being named in a language other than their own. In 2013, the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study carried out by the University of Auckland found no evidence that the word was widely considered to be derogatory; however, only 12 per cent of New Zealanders of European descent actively chose to be identified by the term, with the remainder preferring &#x27;New Zealander&#x27; (53 per cent), &#x27;New Zealand European&#x27; (25 per cent) or &#x27;Kiwi&#x27; (17 per cent).

European New Zealanders vary in their attitudes toward the word when it is applied to themselves. Some embrace it while others object to the word, sometimes strongly, saying it is offensive or derogatory, carrying implications of being an outsider, although this is often based on false information about the meaning of the term. Some believe being labelled Pākehā compromises their status and their birthright links to New Zealand. In the 1986 census, over 36,000 respondents ignored the ethnicities offered, including &quot;Pākehā&quot;, writing-in their ethnicity as &#x27;New Zealander&#x27;, or ignoring the question completely. A joint response code of &#x27;NZ European or Pakeha&#x27; was tried in the 1996 census, but was replaced by &quot;New Zealand European&quot; in later censuses because it drew what Statistics New Zealand described as a &quot;significant adverse reaction from some respondents&quot;. Sociologist Paul Spoonley criticised the new version, saying that many Pākehā would not identify as European.

The term &quot;Pākehā&quot; is also sometimes used among New Zealanders of European ancestry in distinction to the Māori term (foreigner), as an act of emphasising their claims of belonging to the space of New Zealand in contrast to more recent arrivals. Those who prefer to emphasise nationality rather than ethnicity in relating to others living in New Zealand may refer to all New Zealand citizens only as &#x27;New Zealanders&#x27; or by the colloquial term &#x27;Kiwis&#x27;.

Historian Judith Binney called herself a Pākehā and said, &quot;I think it is the most simple and practical term. It is a name given to us by Māori. It has no pejorative associations like people think it does—it&#x27;s a descriptive term. I think it&#x27;s nice to have a name the people who live here gave you, because that&#x27;s what I am.&quot;
New Zealand writer and historian Michael King wrote in 1985: &quot;To say something is Pakeha in character is not to diminish its New Zealand-ness, as some people imply. It is to emphasise it.&quot;

<text>The Heart of the Matter (1948) is a novel by English author Graham Greene. The book details a life-changing moral crisis for Henry Scobie. Greene, a former British intelligence officer in Freetown, British Sierra Leone, drew on his experience there. Although Freetown is not mentioned in the novel, Greene confirms the location in his 1980 memoir, &quot;Ways of Escape&quot;.

&quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; was enormously popular, selling more than 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom upon its release. It won the 1948 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; 40th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. In 2005, the novel was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the one hundred best English-language novels from 1923 to the present. In 2012, it was shortlisted for the Best of the James Tait Black.

The book&#x27;s title appears halfway through the novel: &quot;If one knew, he wondered, the facts, would one have to feel pity even for the planets? If one reached what they called the heart of the matter?&quot;

==Plot summary==
Major Scobie lives in a colony on the west coast of Africa during World War II, and is responsible for local security during wartime. His wife Louise, an unhappy, solitary woman who loves literature and poetry, cannot make friends. Scobie feels responsible for her misery, but does not love her. Their only child, Catherine, died in England several years before. Louise is a devout Catholic. Scobie, a convert, is also devout.

Throughout the novel the oppressive nature of the climate is a major backdrop. The heat and humidity act as weakening factors.

Scobie is passed over for promotion to commissioner, which upsets Louise both for her personal ambition and her hope that the local British community will begin to accept her. Louise asks Scobie if she can go to live in South Africa to escape a life she hates.

At the same time, a new inspector, named Wilson, arrives in the town. He is priggish and socially inept, and hides his passion for poetry for fear of ostracism by his colleagues. He and Louise strike up a friendship, which Wilson mistakes for love. Wilson rooms with another colleague named Harris, who has created a sport for himself of killing the cockroaches that appear in his room each night. He invites Wilson to join him, but in the first match, they end up quarrelling over the rules of engagement.

One of Scobie&#x27;s duties is to lead the inspections of local passenger ships, particularly looking for smuggled diamonds, a needle-in-a-haystack problem that never yields results. A Portuguese ship, the &quot;Esperança&quot; (the Portuguese word for &#x27;hope&#x27;), comes into port, and a disgruntled steward reveals the location of a letter hidden in the captain&#x27;s quarters. Scobie finds it, and because it is addressed to someone in Germany, he confiscates as it might contain secret codes and clandestine information. The captain says it&#x27;s a letter to his daughter and begs Scobie to forget the incident, offering him a bribe of one hundred pounds when he learns that they share the Catholic faith. Scobie declines the bribe and takes the letter, but having opened and read it—contrary to regulations—and finding it innocuous, he decides not to submit it to higher authorities, and burns it.

Scobie is called to a small inland town to deal with the suicide of the local inspector, a man named Pemberton, who was in his early twenties and left a note implying that his suicide was due to a loan he could not repay. Scobie suspects the involvement of the local agent of a Syrian man named Yusef, a local black marketeer. Yusef denies it, but warns Scobie that the British have sent a new inspector specifically to look for diamonds; Scobie claims this is a hoax and that he does not know of any such man. Scobie later dreams that he is in Pemberton&#x27;s situation, even writing a similar note, but when he awakens, he tells himself that he could never commit suicide, as no cause is worth the eternal damnation that suicide would bring.

Scobie tries to secure a loan from the bank to pay the two hundred pound fare for Louise&#x27;s passage, but is turned down. Yusef offers to lend Scobie the money at four per cent per annum. Scobie initially declines, but after an incident where he mistakenly thinks Louise is contemplating suicide, he accepts the loan and sends Louise to South Africa. Wilson meets them at the pier and tries to interfere with their parting.

Shortly afterwards, the survivors of a shipwreck arrive after forty days at sea in lifeboats. One young girl dies as Scobie tries to comfort her by pretending to be her father, who was killed in the wreck. A 19-year-old woman named Helen Rolt also arrives malnourished and dehydrated, clutching an album of postage stamps. She was married before the ship left port and is now a widow with a wedding ring too big for her finger. Scobie feels drawn to her, as much to the cherished album of stamps as to her physical presence, even though she is not beautiful. She reminds him of his daughter.

He soon starts a passionate affair with her, all the time aware that he is committing the grave sin of adultery. A letter he writes to Helen ends up in Yusef&#x27;s hands, and the Syrian uses it to blackmail Scobie into sending a package of diamonds for him via the departing &quot;Esperança&quot;, thus avoiding the authorities.

After Louise unexpectedly returns, Scobie struggles to keep her ignorant of his love affair. But he is unable to renounce Helen, even in the confessional, where the priest instructs him to think it over and postpones absolution. Still, to placate his wife, Scobie attends Mass with her and receives communion in his state of mortal sin—a sacrilege according to Catholic doctrine. Soon after, Yusef&#x27;s servant delivers a &quot;gift&quot; to Scobie, which he refuses. Scobie&#x27;s servant, Ali, however, witnesses this and a romantic embrace between Scobie and Helen. Scobie visits Yusef to confront him about the gift, but also to relate his suspicion that Ali, whom he had trusted for all of their 15 years together, is disloyal. Yusef says he will take care of the matter, which within a few hours ends up with Ali being killed by local teenagers known as &quot;wharf rats&quot;. The reader is led to believe that Yusef arranged the killing for which Scobie blames himself.

Having gone this far down the path of ruin and seeing no way out, Scobie decides to free everyone from himself—including God—and plots his death by faking a heart ailment and getting a prescription for sleeping pills. Knowing full well that suicide is the ultimate damnation according to Church doctrine, he proceeds in the end to commit suicide with the pills. The act, however, yields ambiguous results. Helen continues her dreary existence. And Louise, who knew about the affair all along, is made to realise by her suitor, Wilson, that Scobie&#x27;s death was a suicide. She tells Wilson she will not marry him, but might in time.

The concluding chapter consists of a short encounter between Louise and her confessional priest. Louise tries to rationalise Scobie&#x27;s suicide in relation to his Catholicism, to which the priest advises that no one can know what&#x27;s in a person&#x27;s heart or about God&#x27;s mercy.

==Critical response==
===Contemporary reviews===
Novelist and literary critic George Orwell, in the July 17, 1948 The New Yorker wrote:

Orwell added: “But all the while—drunken, lecherous, criminal, or damned outright—the Catholics retain their superiority, since alone they know the meaning of good and evil.”

Literary critic William DuBois in the July 11, 1948 issue of The New York Times describes Graham Greene as “a profound moralist with a technique to match his purpose” and his protagonist, the policeman Scobie, as “a textbook case of a judge destroyed by his own sentences.” DuBois offers the following passage to illustrate his characterization of &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; as a “parable” of a man who is “victim of his own acute kindness.” Father Rank, the priest, visits Scobie&#x27;s widow to offer condolences shortly after her husband&#x27;s suicide:

DuBois adds: “Such is Mr. Greene&#x27;s parable: the reader will search far to find another novel that explores that basic malaise in such clinical depth—and with such compassion.”

===Later assessments===

Writing in The Guardian, September 17, 2010, literary critic D. J. Taylor places &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; within the legacy of the “Catholic novels” that began to appear in the mid- 19th Century, “born out of the Tractarian movement” and part of the “Catholic tradition in English letters.” Taylor adds that “the real impetus to the Catholic novel&#x27;s mid-[20th] century rise was provided by converts: Evelyn Waugh, Graham Greene and, slightly later, Muriel Spark.” Taylor offers this observation on the critical response to these Catholic-inspired works:

Taylor reports that “any religious novelist faces…the absolute necessity of opening up the exclusive private club to which you belong to the non-members who don&#x27;t wear its tail-coats or drink its claret.”

Literary critic Scott Bradfield in the March 10, 2021 The New Republic, considers &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; a “breakthrough” novel.:

Observing that “Greene’s cynicism about the world—and the sufferings of humanity—came close to nihilism,” Bradfield quotes protagonist Scobie from &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot;: “Point me out the happy man and I will point you out either extreme egotism, evil—or else an absolute ignorance.” Bradfield adds: “It’s hard to think of any similarly productive, commercial novelist today who speaks so vigorously against religious and political pieties.”

==Film==
The novel was made into a film in 1953, directed by George More O&#x27;Ferrall and starring Trevor Howard and Maria Schell, and a TV film version was produced in 1983, featuring Jack Hedley as Scobie. In the film, Scobie contemplates suicide but is actually killed trying to stop a brawl.

<doc id="205767" wikidata="Q589959" url="?curid=205767" title="The Legacy of Heorot">
<text>The Legacy of Heorot is a science fiction novel by American writers Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle, and Steven Barnes, first published in 1987. Reproduction and fertility expert Dr Jack Cohen acted as a consultant on the book, designing the novel life cycle of the alien antagonists, the grendels.

This is the first book in the Heorot series. It concerns the establishment of the first human colony on Avalon, the fourth planet of Tau Ceti.

==Plot summary==
Two hundred colonists arrive on Avalon, having made the 100-year journey from Earth in suspended animation on the starship &quot;Geographic&quot;. The colonists, selected for their outstanding physical and mental acuity, make a terrible discovery: the suspended animation has damaged their intellect and reasoning skills. Some are only mildly afflicted, while others have serious intellectual disabilities; eight cannot be reanimated at all.

The colonists build a settlement on an isolated island, and begin growing crops and stocking the nearby waters with terrestrial species to complement the &quot;samlon&quot;, a local aquatic species. The colonists become overconfident in their security, to the frustration of expedition security officer (and former soldier) Cadmann Weyland. When unsettling events begin to happen – missing animals, fences torn down – the colonists&#x27; impaired minds prevent them from properly analyzing the situation. Weyland is suspected of sabotage to further his agenda of building up defenses. He is drugged and restrained, when a monster attacks the settlement, killing ten colonists.

Resenting his treatment, Weyland retreats from the colony to an isolated homestead on a mountain near the colony. Mary Ann, a colonist with a romantic interest in Weyland, convinces him to allow her to stay with him, and conceives his child. Ultimately, Weyland agrees to assist the colony in its defenses.

The colonists are confounded by the ecology of the island, as there does not seem to be a sufficient food source for the creatures to inhabit it. An autopsy reveals that grendels (as the creatures are now known, in reference to &quot;Beowulf&quot;) are crocodilian in appearance and behavior, with powerful jaws and claws, and a sense of smell better than a dog&#x27;s. Its brain shows it is at least as intelligent as a gorilla. It possesses a snorkel enabling it to lurk under several feet of water. Its cardiovascular system and musculature give it strength and stamina far beyond that of humans. A grendel can release a super-oxygenated blood supplement into its blood that does to it what nitrous oxide does to internal combustion engines – enable short bursts of speed in excess of 100 miles per hour. This trait makes the grendels devastating, but is also the key to their destruction. Using the supercharger causes the grendels to heat up so rapidly that they die if they do not immediately return to water to cool off. With this knowledge and their technology and tactics, the colonists are able to wipe out the grendel population of the island within several months, making Weyland a hero to the people who previously turned on him.

Some months later, the colony&#x27;s scientists come to a disturbing realization: the grendels and the aquatic samlon are the same species. Their life cycle is similar to that of terrestrial frogs – the herbivorous samlon are in fact the juvenile form of the carnivorous grendels. The juvenile samlon are male, and become female when they mature. Interaction is unnecessary, as the grendels continually lay unfertilized eggs in the water for the samlon to fertilize. Like some species of frogs, the grendels are cannibalistic – if no other prey is present, they will eat their own young. On the colony&#x27;s island, all other prey sources were previously exhausted, and the grendels have turned to cannibalism as the rule rather than the exception. The colonists have exterminated the adult grendels. But as there is now no check at all on the samlon population, they all become grendels, meaning that instead of a few dozen grendels, there are now thousands.

Weyland again asserts control. The colony&#x27;s pregnant women, children and essential specialists are evacuated to the &quot;Geographic&quot;. The grendels cannot hunt far from water, so most others are evacuated to Weyland&#x27;s mountain camp. Combat is joined. At first, the colonists&#x27; technology and tactics serve them well. Weyland observes the grendels&#x27; behavior and discovers that packs of grendels can be sent into a shark-like feeding frenzy by spraying them with blood taken from dead grendels, especially if it is laced with the &quot;supercharger&quot; chemical. Tracer bullets are used to ignite the supercharger gland in their bodies.

But as the grendels&#x27; numbers fall, their individual strength rises, as every dead grendel is food for the rest. Eventually, all that remain are the strongest and fastest fully grown grendels, and the colonists make a planned retreat to Weyland&#x27;s mountain retreat. As the horde approaches, the colonists spray them with more superchargers, sending them into a frenzy once more. When they begin climbing the bluff, Weyland sets off a deadfall trap, killing even more. The grendels, though not as smart as humans, are smart enough to learn, given time and much experience. Their behavior changes as they realize the remaining colonists are not worth dying to reach when there are other grendels to kill. The colony is saved.

One year later, the grendels are being driven to extinction. Now that the grendel life cycle is known, the colonists continue the hunts, but this time the samlon are targeted as well. The new tactics, supercharger spraying and recorded grendel challenges, make them almost a routine chore. The terrestrial fish are gone, and will not be reintroduced, forcing the grendels to help drive their own species to extinction through cannibalism. Now rebuilding can begin. The battle against the grendels has left the colony with a surplus of women, and a new social organization based on polygamous marriage is taking shape. The mainland is being explored, and the colonists have high hopes. The colonists hope the story of their battle will inspire Earth&#x27;s population to restart its nascent colonization program.

==Reception==
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; panned the novel as &quot;exciting for about half, thereafter increasingly gory and tedious&quot;, with &quot;absurdly pretentious quotes and allusions&quot; and &quot;too much brawn, not enough brain.&quot; However, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the novel &quot;undertakes that presumptuous exercise [reworking the Beowulf legend in science fiction] not only without disappointment but with substantial success.&quot;

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;The Legacy of Heorot&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #91, and stated that &quot;Despite the resulting thrill of tens of thousands of superpowered flesh-hungry newts interminably assaulting Mr Macho&#x27;s survivalist stronghold, I was tormented by the nagging thought that this would have read better at one-third the length. So it goes.&quot;

J. Michael Caparula reviewed &quot;The Legacy of Heorot&quot; in &quot;Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer&quot; No. 85. Caparula commented that &quot;this a life-or-death struggle for both species, and it is this double tension that makes the book stand out. Recommended&quot;.

<text>The Spui is a small tidal river in South Holland in the Netherlands, connecting the river Oude Maas and the Haringvliet estuary, separating the islands of Voorne-Putten and Hoeksche Waard. Historically, it forked off the Oude Maas at the town of Oud-Beijerland to end in the Haringvliet, but as a (planned) result from the Delta Works, its flow has been reversed. The Spui emerged as a result of a levee breach during the , a storm surge that permanently altered the surrounding landscape. 

There are no bridges or tunnels crossing the Spui, but there is a car ferry from Hekelingen (municipality Nissewaard) to Nieuw-Beijerland (municipality Hoeksche Waard), and a pedestrian and bicycle ferry between Oud-Beijerland and Rhoon (in Albrandswaard).

<text>The Dordtse Kil (pre-1947 spelling: Dordtsche Kil) is a short river in South Holland in the Netherlands. The river is tidal and forms the connection between the Oude Maas river and the Hollands Diep. The river is for most part artificial in origin, since it has been a relatively small tidal creek until the 19th century.

<text>The Hollands Diep (pre-1947 spelling: Hollandsch Diep) is a river in the Netherlands, and an estuary of the Rhine and Meuse rivers. Through the Scheldt-Rhine Canal it connects to the Scheldt river and Antwerp.

The Bergse Maas river and the Nieuwe Merwede river join near Lage Zwaluwe to form the Hollands Diep. The Dordtsche Kil connects to it near Moerdijk. Near Numansdorp it splits into the Haringvliet and the Volkerak.

==History==
The Hollands Diep was formed as a result of the extensive flood of 1216, which breached the dunes of Voorne and created a deep saltwater inlet (the current Haringvliet). During a second flood, the 1421 St. Elizabeth floods, this inlet connected to the Merwede and became an important estuary of the Rhine and Meuse rivers. From that moment on, the freshwater part of the estuary (east of the Hellegatsplein) was renamed Hollands Diep. The former river Striene, that used to connect the Meuse with the Scheldt, was completely destroyed by these floods and can no longer be recognised on maps.


==River crossings==
At the point where the Hollands Diep splits, there is a road traffic node on an artificial island (the Hellegatsplein), connecting to the Hoeksche Waard island on the north by the Haringvliet bridge, to the Goeree-Overflakkee on the west by the Hellegatsdam, and to the mainland on the southeast by the Volkerak Sluices.

On the east side of the Hollands Diep the Moerdijk bridges connect the Dordrecht island on the north to the mainland on the south: a road bridge, a railroad bridge; a second railroad bridge has recently been constructed for the HSL-Zuid.

<doc id="205775" wikidata="Q200924" url="?curid=205775" title="Orbital speed">
<text>In gravitationally bound systems, the orbital speed of an astronomical body or object (e.g. planet, moon, artificial satellite, spacecraft, or star) is the speed at which it orbits around either the barycenter (the combined center of mass) or, if one body is much more massive than the other bodies of the system combined, its speed relative to the center of mass of the most massive body.

The term can be used to refer to either the mean orbital speed (i.e. the average speed over an entire orbit) or its instantaneous speed at a particular point in its orbit. The maximum (instantaneous) orbital speed occurs at periapsis (perigee, perihelion, etc.), while the minimum speed for objects in closed orbits occurs at apoapsis (apogee, aphelion, etc.). In ideal two-body systems, objects in open orbits continue to slow down forever as their distance to the barycenter increases. 

When a system approximates a two-body system, instantaneous orbital speed at a given point of the orbit can be computed from its distance to the central body and the object&#x27;s specific orbital energy, sometimes called &quot;total energy&quot;. Specific orbital energy is constant and independent of position.

==Radial trajectories==
In the following, it is assumed that the system is a two-body system and the orbiting object has a negligible mass compared to the larger (central) object. In real-world orbital mechanics, it is the system&#x27;s barycenter, not the larger object, which is at the focus.

Specific orbital energy, or total energy, is equal to &quot;E&quot;k − &quot;E&quot;p (the difference between kinetic energy and potential energy). The sign of the result may be positive, zero, or negative and the sign tells us something about the type of orbit:
* If the specific orbital energy is positive the orbit is unbound, or open, and will follow a hyperbola with the larger body the focus of the hyperbola. Objects in open orbits do not return; once past periapsis their distance from the focus increases without bound. See radial hyperbolic trajectory
* If the total energy is zero, (&quot;E&quot;k = &quot;E&quot;p): the orbit is a parabola with focus at the other body. See radial parabolic trajectory. Parabolic orbits are also open.
* If the total energy is negative, : The orbit is bound, or closed. The motion will be on an ellipse with one focus at the other body. See radial elliptic trajectory, free-fall time. Planets have bound orbits around the Sun.

==Transverse orbital speed==

The transverse orbital speed is inversely proportional to the distance to the central body because of the law of conservation of angular momentum, or equivalently, Kepler&#x27;s second law. This states that as a body moves around its orbit during a fixed amount of time, the line from the barycenter to the body sweeps a constant area of the orbital plane, regardless of which part of its orbit the body traces during that period of time.

This law implies that the body moves slower near its apoapsis than near its periapsis, because at the smaller distance along the arc it needs to move faster to cover the same area.

==Mean orbital speed==

For orbits with small eccentricity, the length of the orbit 
is close to that of a circular one, and the mean orbital speed can be approximated either from observations of the orbital period and the semimajor axis of its orbit, or from knowledge of the masses of the two bodies and the semimajor axis.

:formula_1

where is the orbital velocity, is the length of the semimajor axis, is the orbital period, and is the standard gravitational parameter. This is an approximation that only holds true when the orbiting body is of considerably lesser mass than the central one, and eccentricity is close to zero.

When one of the bodies is not of considerably lesser mass see: Gravitational two-body problem

So, when one of the masses is almost negligible compared to the other mass, as the case for Earth and Sun, one can approximate the orbit velocity formula_2 as:

:formula_3

or:

:formula_4

Where is the (greater) mass around which this negligible mass or body is orbiting, and is the escape velocity at a distance from the center of the primary body equal to the radius of the orbit.

For an object in an eccentric orbit orbiting a much larger body, the length of the orbit decreases with orbital eccentricity , and is an ellipse. This can be used to obtain a more accurate estimate of the average orbital speed:
:formula_5

The mean orbital speed decreases with eccentricity.

==Instantaneous orbital speed==
For the instantaneous orbital speed of a body at any given point in its trajectory, both the mean distance and the instantaneous distance are taken into account:

:formula_6

where is the standard gravitational parameter of the orbited body, is the distance at which the speed is to be calculated, and is the length of the semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit. This expression is called the vis-viva equation.

For the Earth at perihelion, the value is:

:formula_7

which is slightly faster than Earth&#x27;s average orbital speed of , as expected from Kepler&#x27;s 2nd Law.

== Planets ==
The closer an object is to the Sun the faster it needs to move to maintain the orbit. Objects move fastest at perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) and slowest at aphelion (furthest distance from the Sun). Since planets in the Solar System are in nearly circular orbits their individual orbital velocities do not vary much. Being closest to the Sun and having the most eccentric orbit, Mercury&#x27;s orbital speed varies from about 59 km/s at perihelion to 39 km/s at aphelion.

Halley&#x27;s Comet on an eccentric orbit that reaches beyond Neptune will be moving 54.6 km/s when from the Sun, 41.5 km/s when 1 AU from the Sun (passing Earth&#x27;s orbit), and roughly 1 km/s at aphelion from the Sun. Objects passing Earth&#x27;s orbit going faster than 42.1 km/s have achieved escape velocity and will be ejected from the Solar System if not slowed down by a gravitational interaction with a planet.

<doc id="205779" wikidata="Q291486" url="?curid=205779" title="Compress (software)">
<text>compress is a Unix shell compression program based on the LZW compression algorithm. Compared to gzip&#x27;s fastest setting, compress is slightly slower at compression, slightly faster at decompression, and has a significantly lower compression ratio. 1.8 MiB of memory is used to compress the Hutter Prize data, slightly more than gzip&#x27;s slowest setting.

The uncompress utility will restore files to their original state after they have been compressed using the &quot;compress&quot; utility. If no files are specified, the standard input will be uncompressed to the standard output.
== Description ==
Files compressed by &quot;compress&quot; are typically given the extension &quot;.Z&quot; (modeled after the earlier pack program which used the extension &quot;.z&quot;). Most &quot;tar&quot; programs will pipe their data through &quot;compress&quot; when given the command line option &quot;codice_1&quot;. (The &quot;tar&quot; program in its own does not compress; it just stores multiple files within one tape archive.)

Files can be returned to their original state using &quot;uncompress&quot;. The usual action of &quot;uncompress&quot; is not merely to create an uncompressed copy of the file, but also to restore the timestamp and other attributes of the compressed file.

For files produced by &quot;compress&quot; on other systems, &quot;uncompress&quot; supports 9- to 16-bit compression.

== History ==
The LZW algorithm used in was patented by Sperry Research Center in 1983. Terry Welch published an IEEE article on the algorithm in 1984, but failed to note that he had applied for a patent on the algorithm. Spencer Thomas of the University of Utah took this article and implemented in 1984, without realizing that a patent was pending on the LZW algorithm. The GIF image format also incorporated LZW compression in this way, and Unisys later claimed royalties on implementations of GIF. Joseph M. Orost led the team and worked with Thomas et al. to create the &#x27;final&#x27; (4.0) version of and published it as free software to the &#x27;net.sources&#x27; USENET group in 1985. was granted in 1985, and this is why could not be used without paying royalties to Sperry Research, which was eventually merged into Unisys. 

 has fallen out of favor in particular user-groups because it makes use of the LZW algorithm, which was covered by a Unisys patentbecause of this, gzip and bzip2 increased in popularity on Linux-based operating systems due to their alternative algorithms, along with better file compression. &quot;compress&quot; has, however, maintained a presence on Unix and BSD systems and the and commands have also been ported to the IBM i operating system.

The US LZW patent expired in 2003, so it is now in the public domain in the United States. All patents on the LZW worldwide have also expired (see Graphics Interchange Format#Unisys and LZW patent enforcement).

As of POSIX.1-2024 &quot;compress&quot; supports the DEFLATE algorithm used in gzip.

== Special output format ==
The output binary consists of bit groups. Each bit group consists of codes with fixed amount of bits (9–16). Each group, except the last group, is aligned to the number of bits per code multiplied by 8 and right padded with zeroes. The last group is aligned to 8 bit octets and padded with zeroes. More information can be found at an issue on the &quot;ncompress&quot; GitHub repository.

Example:
: Suppose the output has ten 9-bit codes, five 10-bit codes, and thirteen 11-bit codes. There are three groups to output containing 90 bits, 50 bits, and 143 bits of data.
:* First group will be 90 bits of data + 54 zero bits of padding in order to be aligned to 72 bits (9 bits × 8).
:* Second group will be 50 bits of data + 30 zero bits of padding in order to be aligned to 80 bits (10 bits × 8).
:* Third group will be 143 bits of data + 1 zero bit of padding in order to be aligned to 8 bits (since this is the last group in the output).

It is actually a bug. LZW does not require any alignment. This bug existed for more than 35 years and was in the original UNIX &quot;compress&quot;, &quot;ncompress&quot;, &quot;gzip&quot; and the Windows port. All &quot;application/x-compress&quot; files were created using this bug.

Some compress implementations write random bits from uninitialized buffer in paddings. There is no guarantee that the paddings will be zeroes. The decompressor must ignore the values in the paddings for compatibility.

== Standardization and availability ==
compress was standardized in X/Open CAE Specification in 1994, and further in The Open Group Base Specifications, Issue 6 and 7. Linux Standard Base does not requires compress.

compress is often not installed by default in Linux distributions, but can be installed from an additional package. compress is available for FreeBSD, OpenBSD, MINIX, Solaris and AIX.

compress is allowed for Point-to-Point Protocol in and for HTTP/1.1 in , though it is rarely used in modern deployments as the better deflate/gzip is available.

The gunzip utility is able to decompress .Z files.

<text>Thomas J. Bassler (July 7, 1932 – December 13, 2011), who used the pseudonym T. J. Bass, was an American science fiction author and physician, having graduated from the University of Iowa in 1959. Bassler is also known for his controversial claim that nonsmokers who are able to complete a marathon in under four hours can eat whatever they wish and never suffer a fatal heart attack.
John Robbins has noted that Jim Fixx approvingly quoted Bassler in his best-selling book, &quot;The Complete Book of Running&quot;. Fixx died from heart failure at 52 while running.

Two of Bass&#x27; novels, &quot;Half Past Human&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Godwhale&quot; (1974), were nominated for the Nebula Award. In both his books the Hive was a three trillion population of &#x27;nebishes&#x27; - humans who had four toes and all aggressiveness bred out of them.

<doc id="205781" wikidata="Q3137940" url="?curid=205781" title="History of the Kurds">
<text>The Kurds are an Iranian ethnic group in the Middle East. They have historically inhabited the mountainous areas to the south of Lake Van and Lake Urmia, a geographical area collectively referred to as Kurdistan. Most Kurds speak Northern Kurdish Kurmanji Kurdish (Kurmanji) and Central Kurdish (Sorani).

There are various hypotheses as to predecessor populations of the Kurds, such as the Carduchoi of Classical Antiquity. The earliest known Kurdish dynasties under Islamic rule (10th to 12th centuries) are the Hasanwayhids, the Marwanids, the Rawadids, the Shaddadids, followed by the Ayyubid dynasty founded by Saladin. The Battle of Chaldiran of 1514 is an important turning point in Kurdish history, marking the alliance of Kurds with the Ottomans. The &quot;Sharafnameh&quot; of 1597 is the first account of Kurdish history. Kurdish history in the 20th century is marked by a rising sense of Kurdish nationhood focused on the goal of an independent Kurdistan as scheduled by the Treaty of Sèvres in 1920. Partial autonomy was reached by Kurdistan Uyezd (1923–1926) and by Iraqi Kurdistan (since 1991), while notably in Turkish Kurdistan, an armed conflict between the Kurdish insurgent groups and Turkish Armed Forces was ongoing from 1984 to 1999, and the region continues to be unstable with renewed violence flaring up in the 2000s.

==Name==
There are different theories about the origin of the name &quot;Kurd&quot;. According to one theory, it originates in Middle Persian as كورت &quot;kwrt-&quot;, a term for &quot;nomad; tent-dweller&quot;. After the Muslim conquest of Persia, this term was adopted into Arabic as &quot;kurd-&quot;, and was used specifically for nomadic tribes.

The ethnonym &quot;Kurd&quot; may ultimately derive from an ancient toponym in the upper Tigris basin. According to the English Orientalist Godfrey Rolles Driver, the term &quot;Kurd&quot; is related to the Sumerian &quot;Karda&quot; which was found in Sumerian clay tablets of the third millennium B.C. He wrote in a paper published in 1923 that the term &quot;Kurd&quot; was not used differently by different nations and by examining the philological variations of Karda in different languages, such as &quot;Cordueni&quot;, &quot;Gordyeni&quot;, &quot;Kordyoui&quot;, &quot;Karduchi&quot;, &quot;Kardueni&quot;, &quot;Qardu&quot;, &quot;Kardaye&quot;, &quot;Qardawaye&quot;, he finds that the similarities undoubtedly refer to a common descent.

It has been argued that &quot;Kurd&quot; may ultimately reflect a Bronze Age toponym &quot;Qardu&quot;, &quot;Kar-da&quot;, which may also be reflected in the Arabic (Quranic) toponym &quot;Ǧūdī&quot; (re-adopted in Kurdish as &quot;Cûdî&quot;)
The name would be continued in classical antiquity as the first element in the toponym &quot;Corduene&quot;, and its inhabitants, mentioned by Xenophon as the tribe of the &quot;Carduchoi&quot; who opposed the retreat of the Ten Thousand through the mountains north of Mesopotamia in the 4th century BC. This view is supported by some recent academic sources which have considered Corduene as proto-Kurdish region. However, some modern scholars reject these connections. Alternatively, &quot;kwrt-&quot; may be a derivation from the name of the &quot;Cyrtii&quot; tribe instead.

According to some sources, by the 16th century, there seems to develop an ethnic identity designated by the term &quot;Kurd&quot; among various Northwestern Iranian groups, without reference to any specific Iranian language.

Sherefxan Bidlisi in the 16th century states that there are four divisions of &quot;Kurds&quot;: &quot;Kurmanj&quot;, &quot;Lur&quot;, &quot;Kalhor&quot; and &quot;Guran&quot;, each of which speak a different dialect or language variation. Paul (2008) notes that the 16th-century usage of the term &quot;Kurd&quot; as recorded by Bidlisi, regardless of linguistic grouping, might still reflect an incipient Northwestern Iranian &quot;Kurdish&quot; ethnic identity uniting the Kurmanj, Kalhor, and Guran.

==Early history==
Kurdish is a language of the Northwestern Iranian group which likely separated from the other dialects of Central Iran during the early centuries AD (the Middle Iranian period). Kurdish in turn emerged as a group within Northwest Iranian during the Medieval Period (roughly 10th to 16th centuries).

The Kurdish people are believed to be of heterogeneous origins, both from Iranian-speaking and non-Iranian peoples, combining a number of earlier tribal or ethnic groups including Lullubi, Guti, Cyrtians, Sumerian and Carduchi.

The present state of knowledge about Kurdish allows, at least roughly, drawing the approximate borders of the areas where the main ethnic core of the speakers of the contemporary Kurdish dialects was formed. The most argued hypothesis on the localisation of the ethnic territory of the Kurds remains D.N. Mackenzie&#x27;s theory, proposed in the early 1960s. Developing the ideas of P. Tedesco and regarding the common phonetic isoglosses shared by Kurdish, Persian, and Baluchi, D.N. Mackenzie concluded that the speakers of these three languages form a unity within Northwestern Iranian. He has tried to reconstruct such a Persian-Kurdish-Baluchi linguistic unity presumably in the central parts of Iran. According to his theory, the Persians (or Proto-Persians) occupied the province of Fars in the southwest (proceeding from the fact that the Achaemenids spoke Persian), the Balochs (Proto-Balochs) inhabited the central areas of Western Iran, and the Kurds (Proto-Kurds), in the wording of G. Windfuhr (1975: 459), lived either in northwestern Luristan or in the province of Isfahan.

===Early Kurdish principalities===
In the second half of the 10th century there were five Kurdish principalities: in the north the Shaddadid (951–1174) (in parts of Armenia and Arran) and Rawadid (955–1221) in Tabriz and Maragheh, in the East the Hasanwayhids (959–1015), the Annazid (990–1117) (in Kermanshah, &quot;Dinawar&quot; and Khanaqin) and in the West the Marwanid (990–1096) of Diyarbakır.

Later in the 12th century, the Kurdish Hazaraspid dynasty established its rule in southern Zagros and Luristan and conquered territories of Kuhgiluya, Khuzestan and Golpayegan in the 13th century and annexed Shushtar, Hoveizeh and Basra in the 14th century.

One of these dynasties may have been able, during the decades, to impose its supremacy on the others and build a state incorporating the whole Kurdish country if the course of history had not been disrupted by the massive invasions of tribes surging out of the steppes of Central Asia. Having conquered Iran and imposed their yoke on the caliph of Baghdad, the Seljuq Turks annexed the Kurdish principalities one by one. Around 1150, Ahmad Sanjar, the last of the great Seljuq monarchs, created a province out of these lands and called it Kurdistan. The province of Kurdistan, formed by Sanjar, had as its capital the village Bahar (which means lake or sea), near ancient Ecbatana (Hamadan). It included the vilayets of Sinjar and Shahrazur to the west of the Zagros mountain range and those of Hamadan, Dinawar and Kermanshah to the east of this range. An autochthonous civilization developed around the town of Dinawar (today ruined), located 75 km North-East of Kermanshah, whose radiance was later only partially replaced by that of Senna, 90 km further North.

Marco Polo (1254–1324) met Kurds in Mosul on his way to China, and he wrote what he had learned about Kurdistan and the Kurds to enlighten his European contemporaries. The Italian Kurdologist Mirella Galetti, sorted these writings which were translated into Kurdish.

===Ayyubid period===


One of the periods where Kurds were at the peak of their power was during the 12th century, when Saladin, who belonged to the Rawadiya branch of the Hadabani tribe, founded the Ayyubid dynasty, under which several Kurdish chieftainships were established. The dynasty ruled areas extending from the Kurdish regions to as far as Egypt and Yemen.

===Kurdish principalities from 16th century to 19th century ===
Kurds established several independent states or principalities such as Ardalan, Badinan, Baban, Soran, Hakkari and Badlis. A comprehensive history of these states and their relationship with their neighbors is given in the famous textbook of &quot;Sharafnama&quot; written by Prince Sharaf al-Din Biltisi in 1597. The most prominent among these was Ardalan which was established in the early 14th century. The state of Ardalan controlled the territories of Zardiawa (Karadagh), Khanaqin, Kirkuk, Kifri, and Hawraman, despite being vassals themselves of the various in Persia centred succeeding Turkic federations in the region, namely that of the Kara Koyunlu, and the Ak Koyunlu specifically. The capital city of this state of Ardalan was first in Sharazour in Iraqi Kurdistan, but was moved to Sinne (in Iran) later on. The Ardalan Dynasty was allowed to rule the region as vassals by many of the sovereign rulers over the wider territory, until the Qajar monarch Nasser-al-Din Shah (1848–1896) ended their rule in 1867.

==Kurdish quarters==
In the Middle Ages, in many cities outside of Kurdistan, Kurdish quarters were formed as a result of an influx of Kurdish tribal forces, as well as scholars. In these cities, Kurds often also had mosques, madrasahs and other edifices.
* In Aleppo, the Haret al-Akrad. The city of Aleppo also had Kurdish mosques like al-Zarzari, al-Mihrani, al-Bashnawayin.
* In Baghdad, Darb al-Kurd, recorded since the 11th century.
* In Barda, Bab al-Akrad, recorded in the 10th century.
* In Cairo, Haret al-Akrad, at al-Maqs.
* In Damascus, Mount Qasyun at Rukn al-dîn and Suq al-Saruja. Kurdish notables had also built mosques and madrasahs by name of al-Mudjadiyya, Sab&#x27; al-Madjânîn, al-Mihrani. Some other notables who patronized buildings were Balâchû al-Kurdî, Musa al-Kurdi, Habib al-Kurdi. There also was a Kurdish cemetery.
* In Gaza, Shuja&#x27;iyya, named after Shuja&#x27; al-Din Uthman al-Kurdi, who died in 1239.
* In Hebron, Haret al-Akrad: associated with the Ayyubid conquests.
* In Jerusalem, Haret al-Akrad (later Haret esh-Sharaf, named after a certain Sharaf ad-Din Musa, who died in 1369). The city also had a madrasah-ribat by the name of Ribat al-Kurd, built in 1294 by Amir Kurd al-Mansuri (Kurt al-Manṣūrī).

==Safavid period==

For many centuries, starting in the early modern period with Ismail I, Shah of Safavid Persia, and Ottoman Sultan Selim I, the Kurds came under the suzerainty of the two most powerful empires of the Near East and staunch arch rivals, the Sunni Ottoman Empire and the various Shia Empires. It started off with the rule of Ismail I, who ruled over all regions that encompass native Kurdish living areas, and far beyond. During the years 1506–1510, Yazidis revolted against Ismail I (who had Kurdish ancestry himself). Their leader, Shir Sarim, was defeated and captured in a bloody battle wherein several important officers of Ismail lost their lives. The Kurdish prisoners were put to death &quot;with torments worse than which there may not be&quot;.

In the mid-17th century the Kurds on the western borders disposed of firearms, According to Tavernier, the mountain people between Nineveh and Isfahan would not sell anything but for gunpowder and bullets. Even so, firearms were incorporated neither wholesale nor wholeheartedly among the Kurds, apparently for the same reasons that hindered their acceptance in iran proper. In a Persian statistical overview of tribes dating from the period of Shah sultan Husayn in the early 18th century, it is said that the Kurds of Zafaranlo tribe refused to carry the Tufang, because they considered it unmanly to do so, as a result of which most continued to fight with lance and sword, and some with arrow and bow.

===Displacement of the Kurds===
Removal of the population from along their borders with the Ottomans in Kurdistan and the Caucasus was of strategic importance to the Safavids. Hundreds of thousands of Kurds were moved to other regions in the Safavid empire, only to defend the borders there. Hundreds of thousands of other ethnic groups living in the Safavid empire such as the Armenians, Assyrians, Georgians, Circassians, and Turkomans, were also removed from the border regions and resettled in the interior of Persia, but mainly for other reasons such as socio-economic, and bureaucratic ones. During several periods, as the borders moved progressively eastward, with the Ottomans pushing deeper into the Persian domains, entire Kurdish regions of Anatolia were at one point or another exposed to horrific acts of despoliation and deportation. These began under the reign of the Safavid Shah Tahmasp I (ruled 1524–1576). Between 1534 and 1535, Tahmasp, using a policy of scorched earth against his Ottoman arch rivals, began the systematic destruction of the old Kurdish cities and the countryside. When retreating before the Ottoman army, Tahmasp ordered the destruction of crops and settlements of all sizes, driving the inhabitants before him into Azerbaijan, from where they were later transferred permanently, nearly 1,600 km (1,000 miles) east, into Khurasan.

Shah Abbas inherited a state threatened by the Ottomans in the west and the Uzbeks in the northeast. He bought off the former, in order to gain time to defeat the latter, after which he selectively depopulated the Zagros and Caucasus approaches, deporting Kurds, Armenians, Georgians, North Caucasians and others who might, willingly or not, supply, support or be any use in an Ottoman campaign in the region. Shah Abbas forcibly depopulated much of the Kurdish lands ahead of the Ottoman expansion. He made it lucrative and prestigious for Kurds to become military conscripts, and raised an army of tens of thousands of predominantly Kurdish soldiers. Abbas also razed villages to the ground and marched the people into the Persian heartland.

The magnitude of Safavid Scorched earth policy can be glimpsed through the works of the Safavid court historians. One of these, &quot;Iskandar Bayg Munshi&quot;, describing just one episode, writes in the &quot;Alam-ara ye Abbasi&quot; that Shah Abbas, in furthering the scorched earth policy of his predecessors, &quot;set upon the country north of the Araxes and west of Urmia, and between Kars and Lake Van, which he commanded to be laid waste and the population of the countryside and the entire towns rounded up and led out of harm&#x27;s way.&quot; Resistance was met &quot;with massacres and mutilation; all immovable property, houses, churches, mosques, crops ... were destroyed, and the whole horde of prisoners was hurried southeast before the Ottomans should counterattack&quot;. Many of these Kurds ended up in Khurasan, but many others were scattered into the Alburz mountains, central Persia, and even Balochistan. They became the nucleus of several modern Kurdish enclaves outside Kurdistan proper, in Iran and Turkmenistan. On one occasion Abbas I is said to have intended to transplant 40,000 Kurds to northern Khorasan but to have succeeded in deporting only 15,000 before his troops were defeated.

=== Massacre of Ganja ===
According to the early 17th century Armenian historian Arak&#x27;el Davrizhetsi, the Sunni Kurdish tribe of Jekirlu inhabited the region of Ganja. In 1606, when Shah Abbas reconquered Ganja, he ordered a general massacre of the Jekirlu. Even infants were slaughtered with sharp swords.

===Battle of Dimdim===
There is a well documented historical account of a long battle in 1609–1610 between Kurds and the Safavid Empire. The battle took place around a fortress called &quot;Dimdim&quot; (DimDim) in Beradost region around Lake Urmia in northwestern Iran. In 1609, the ruined structure was rebuilt by &quot;Emîr Xan Lepzêrîn&quot; (Golden Hand Khan), ruler of Beradost, who sought to maintain the independence of his expanding principality in the face of both Ottoman and Safavid penetration into the region. Rebuilding Dimdim was considered a move toward independence that could threaten Safavid power in the northwest. Many Kurds, including the rulers of Mukriyan rallied around Amir Khan. After a long and bloody siege led by the Safavid grand vizier Hatem Beg, which lasted from November 1609 to the summer of 1610, Dimdim was captured. All the defenders were massacred. Shah Abbas ordered a general massacre in Beradost and Mukriyan (reported by Eskandar Beg Turkoman, Safavid Historian in the Book &quot;Alam Aray-e Abbasi&quot;) and resettled the Turkish Afshar tribe in the region while deporting many Kurdish tribes to Khorasan. Although Persian historians (like Eskandar Beg) depicted the first battle of Dimdim as a result of Kurdish mutiny or treason, in Kurdish oral traditions (Beytî dimdim), literary works (Dzhalilov, pp. 67–72), and histories, it was treated as a struggle of the Kurdish people against foreign domination. In fact, Beytî dimdim is considered a national epic second only to Mem û Zîn by Ahmad Khani. The first literary account of this battle is written by Faqi Tayran.

==Ottoman period==

When Sultan Selim I, after defeating Shah Ismail I in 1514, annexed Western Armenia and Kurdistan, he entrusted the organisation of the conquered territories to Idris, the historian, who was a Kurd of Bitlis. He divided the territory into &quot;sanjaks&quot; or districts, and, making no attempt to interfere with the principle of heredity, installed the local chiefs as governors. He also resettled the rich pastoral country between Erzerum and Yerevan, which had lain in waste since the passage of Timur, with Kurds from the Hakkari and Bohtan districts.

===Janpulat Revolt===
The Janpulat (Turkish: Canpulatoğlu, Arabic: Junblat) clan was ruled by local Kurdish feudal lords in the Jabal al-Akrad and Aleppo region for almost a century before the Ottoman conquest of Syria. Their leader, Hussein Janpulatoğlu, was appointed as governor of Aleppo in 1604, however he was executed by Çiğalzade Sinan Pasha allegedly for his late arrival at the Battle of Urmia. According to Abul Wafa Al-Urdi, Janpulat had been murdered because of his Kurdish origins. His nephew, Ali Janbulad, revolted in revenge and declared sovereignty in 1606 and was supported by the Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinand I. He conquered a region stretching from Hama to Adana with 30,000 troops. Grand Vizier, Murad Pasha, marched against him with a large army in 1607. Ali Pasha managed to escape and was later pardoned and appointed governor of province of Temesvár in Hungary. He was eventually executed by Murad Pasha in Belgrade in 1610.

===Rozhiki Revolt===
In 1655, &quot;Abdal Khan&quot; the Kurdish &quot;Rozhiki&quot; ruler of Bidlis, formed a private army and fought a full scale war against the Ottoman troops. Evliya Çelebi noted the presence of many Yazidis in his army. The main reason for this armed insurrection was the discord between Abdal Khan and Melek Ahmad Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Diyarbakır and Abdal Khan. The Ottoman troops marched onto Bidlis and committed atrocities against civilians as they passed through &quot;Rozhiki&quot; territory. Abdal Khan had built great stone redoubts around Bitlis, and also old city walls were defended by a large army of Kurdish infantry armed with muskets. Ottomans attacked the outer defensive perimeter and defeated Rozhiki soldiers, then they rushed to loot Bidlis and attacked the civilians. Once the Ottoman force established its camp in Bidlis, in an act of revenge, Abdal Khan made a failed attempt to assassinate Melek Ahmad Pasha. A unit of twenty Kurdish soldiers rode into the tent of Yusuf Kethuda, the second-in-command and fought a ferocious battle with his guards. After the fall of Bidlis, 1,400 Kurds continued to resist from the city&#x27;s old citadel. While most of these surrendered and were given amnesty, 300 of them were massacred by Melek Ahmad with 70 of them dismembered by sword and cut into pieces.

===Bedr Khan of Botan===

Except for the short Iranian recapture under Nader Shah in the first half of the 18th century, the system of administration introduced by Idris remained unchanged until the close of the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29. But the Kurds, owing to the remoteness of their country from the capital and the decline of Turkey, had greatly increased in influence and power, and had spread westwards over the country as far as Ankara.

After the war with Russia, the Kurds attempted to free themselves from Ottoman control which resulted in the Bedr Khan clan uprising in 1834. The Ottoman Porte made the decision to then end the autonomous regions of the Eastern portion of the Empire. This was done by Rashid Pasha, also a Kurd. The principal towns were strongly garrisoned, and many of the Kurd beys were replaced by Turkish governors. A rising under Bedr Khan Bey in 1843 was firmly repressed, and after the Crimean War the Turks strengthened their hold on the country. In the 1830&#x27;s, Bedr Khan was defeated by the united Assyrians of Hakkari.

The modernizing and centralizing efforts of Sultan Mahmud II antagonized Kurdish feudal chiefs. As a result two powerful Kurdish families rebelled against the Ottomans in 1830. &quot;Bedr Khan&quot; of Botan rose up in the west of Kurdistan, around Diyarbakır, and &quot;Muhammad Pasha&quot; of Rawanduz rebelled in the east and established his authority in Mosul and Erbil. At this time, Turkish troops were preoccupied with invading Egyptian troops in Syria and were unable to suppress the revolt. As a result, &quot;Bedr Khan&quot; extended his authority to &quot;Diyarbakır&quot;, &quot;Siverik&quot; (Siverek), &quot;Veransher&quot; (Viranşehir), &quot;Sairt&quot; (Siirt), &quot;Sulaimania&quot; (Sulaymaniyah) and &quot;Sauj Bulaq&quot; (Mahabad). He established a Kurdish principality in these regions until 1845. He struck his own coins, and his name was included in Friday sermons. In 1847, the Turkish forces turned their attention toward this area, and defeated Bedr Khan and exiled him to Crete. He was later allowed to return to Damascus, where he lived until his death in 1868. Bedr Khan Beg made two campaigns in 1843 and 1846 against the Assyrian Christians (Nestorians) of Hakkari and massacred up to 4,000 Assyrians in an attempt to Islamize the region; those Assyrians who met their fate were the mother and the two brothers of the yet to be spiritual Assyrian leader Mar Shimun.

Bedr Khan became king when his brother died. His brother&#x27;s son became very upset over this, which the Turks exploited in tricking him into fighting his uncle. They told him that they would make him king if he killed Bedr Khan. Bedr Khan&#x27;s nephew brought many Kurdish warriors with to attack his uncle&#x27;s forces. After defeating Bedr Khan, Bedr Khan&#x27;s nephew was executed instead of becoming king as the Turks had promised. There are two famous Kurdish songs about this battle, called &quot;Ezdin Shêr&quot; and &quot;Ez Xelef im&quot;. After this, there were further revolts in 1850 and 1852.

Kurdistan as an administrative entity had a brief and shaky existence of 17 years between 13 December 1847 (following Bedirhan Bey&#x27;s revolt) and 1864, under the initiative of Koca Mustafa Reşit Pasha during the Tanzimat period (1839–1876) of the Ottoman Empire. The capital of the province was, at first, Ahlat, and covered Diyarbekir, Muş, Van, Hakkari, Botan (Cizre) and Mardin. In the following years, the capital was transferred several times, first from Ahlat to Van, then to Muş and finally to Diyarbakır. Its area was reduced in 1856 and the province of Kurdistan within the Ottoman Empire was abolished in 1864. Instead, the former provinces of Diyarbekir and Van have been re-constituted. Around 1880, Shaikh Ubaidullah led a revolt aiming at bringing the areas between Lakes Van and Urmia under his own rule, however Ottoman and Qajar forces succeeded in defeating the revolt.

===Shaikh Ubaidullah&#x27;s Revolt and Armenians===

The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 was followed by the uprising of Sheikh Ubeydullah in 1880–1881 to found an independent Kurd principality under the protection of Turkey. The attempt, at first encouraged by the Porte, as a reply to the projected creation of an Armenian state under the suzerainty of Russia, collapsed after Ubeydullah&#x27;s raid into Persia, when various circumstances led the central government to reassert its supreme authority. Until the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829 there had been little hostile feeling between the Kurds and the Armenians, and as late as 1877–1878 the mountaineers of both races had co-existed fairly well together.

In 1891, the activity of the Armenian Committees induced the Porte to strengthen the position of the Kurds by raising a body of Kurdish irregular cavalry, who were well-armed Hamidieh soldiers after the Sultan Abd-ul-Hamid II. Minor disturbances constantly occurred, and were soon followed by a massacre and rape of Armenians at Sasun by Kurdish nomads and Ottoman troops.

==20th century history==

===Rise of nationalism===
Kurdish nationalism emerged at the end of the 19th Century around the same time as Turks and Arabs began to embrace an ethnic sense of identity in place of earlier forms of solidarity such as the idea of Ottoman citizenship or membership of a religious community, or &quot;millet&quot;. Revolts occurred sporadically but only in 1880 with the uprising led by Sheikh Ubeydullah were demands as an ethnic group or nation made. Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid responded by a campaign of integration by co-opting prominent Kurdish opponents to strong Ottoman power with prestigious positions in his government. This strategy appears successful given the loyalty displayed by the Kurdish Hamidiye regiments during World War I.

The Kurdish ethnonationalist movement that emerged following World War I and end of the Ottoman empire was largely reactionary to the changes taking place in mainstream Turkey, primarily radical secularization which the strongly Muslim Kurds abhorred, centralization of authority which threatened the power of local chieftains and Kurdish autonomy, and rampant Turkish nationalism in the new Turkish Republic which obviously threatened to marginalize them.

Western powers (particularly the United Kingdom) fighting the Turks also promised the Kurds they would act as guarantors for Kurdish independence, a promise they subsequently broke. One particular organization, the Kurdish Teali Cemiyet (Society for the Rise of Kurdistan, or SAK) was central to the forging of a distinct Kurdish identity. It took advantage of period of political liberalization during the Second Constitutional Era (1908–1920) of Turkey to transform a renewed interest in Kurdish culture and language into a political nationalist movement based on ethnicity.

===After World War I===

Some Kurdish groups sought self-determination and the championing in the Treaty of Sèvres of Kurdish autonomy in the aftermath of World War I, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk prevented such a result. Kurds backed by the United Kingdom declared independence in 1927 and established so-called Republic of Ararat. Turkey suppressed Kurdist revolts in 1925, 1930, and 1937–1938, while Iran did the same in the 1920s to Simko Shikak at Lake Urmia and Jaafar Sultan of Hewraman region who controlled the region between Marivan and north of Halabja.

From 1922 to 1924 in Iraq, a Kingdom of Kurdistan existed. When Ba&#x27;athist administrators thwarted Kurdish nationalist ambitions in Iraq, war broke out in the 1960s. In 1970 the Kurds rejected limited territorial self-rule within Iraq, demanding larger areas including the oil-rich Kirkuk region. For recent developments see Iraqi Kurdistan.

In 1922, an investigation was initiated for Nihad Pasha, the commander of El-Cezire front, by &quot;Adliye Encümeni&quot; (Council of Justice) of Grand National Assembly of Turkey with allegations of fraud. During a confidential convention on the issue on 22 July, a letter of introductions by the Cabinet of Ministers and signed by Mustafa Kemal was read. The text was referring to the region as &quot;Kurdistan&quot; three times and providing Nihad Pasha with full authorities to support the local Kurdish administrations (&quot;idare-i mahallîyeye dair teşkilâtlar&quot;) as per the principle of self-determination (&quot;Milletlerin kendi mukadderatlarını bizzat idare etme hakkı&quot;), in order to gradually establish a local government in the regions inhabited by Kurds (&quot;Kürtlerle meskûn menatık&quot;).

In 1931, Iraqi Kurdish statesman Mihemed Emîn Zekî, while serving as the Minister of the Economy in the first Nuri as-Said government, drew the boundaries of Turkish Kurdistan as: &quot;With mountains of Ararat and the Georgian border (including the region of Kars, where Kurds and Georgians live side by side) to the north, Iranian border to the east, Iraqi border to the south, and to the west, a line drawn from the west of Sivas to İskenderun. These boundaries are also in accord with those drawn by the Ottomans.&quot; In 1932, Garo Sassouni, formerly a prominent figure of Dashnak Armenia, defined the borders of &quot;Kurdistan proper&quot; (excluding whole territory of Wilsonian Armenia) as: &quot;... with a line from the south of Erzincan to Kharput, incorporating Dersim, Çarsancak, and Malatya, including the mountains of Cebel-i Bereket and reaching the Syrian border&quot;, also adding, &quot;these are the broadest boundaries of Kurdistan that can be claimed by Kurds.&quot;

During the 1920s and 1930s, several large-scale Kurdish revolts took place in this region. The most important ones were the Saikh Said Rebellion in 1925, the Ararat Revolt in 1930 and the Dersim Revolt in 1938 (see Kurds in Turkey). Following these rebellions, the area of Turkish Kurdistan was put under martial law and many Kurds were displaced. Government also encouraged resettlement of Albanians from Kosovo and Assyrians in the region to change the population makeup. These events and measures led to a long-lasting mutual distrust between Ankara and the Kurds.

In 1937 and 1944 Soviet Kurds experienced forced deportations from Azerbaijan SSR (mostly), Armenian SSR and Georgian SSR.

===World War II===

During World War Two, the Kurds formed 10 companies in the Iraq Levies that the British had recruited in Iraq. Kurds supported the British in the defeating the pro-Nazi 1941 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état. Twenty-five percent of the Iraq Levies&#x27; 1st Parachute Company was Kurdish. The Parachute Company was attached to the Royal Marine Commando and was active in Albania, Italy, Greece, and Cyprus.

Kurds participated in the Soviet occupation of northern Iraq in 1941, creating the Persian Corridor, a vital supply line for the USSR. This led to the short-lived formation of the Kurdish Republic of Mahabad.

Despite the fact they were a tiny minority in the Soviet Union, Kurds played a significant role in the Soviet war effort. On 1 October 1941, Samand Siabandov was awarded the honour Hero of the Soviet Union. Kurds served at Smolensk, Sevastopol, Leningrad, and Stalingrad. Kurds took part in the partisan movement behind German lines. Karaseva received both the Hero of the Soviet Union medal and the medal Partisan of the Fatherland War (First Degree) for organising partisans to fight against the Germans in Volhynia Oblast in Ukraine. Kurds took part in the advance into Hungary and the invasion of Japanese-held Manchuria.

==Post-WWII==

===Turkey===

About half of all Kurds live in Turkey. According to the CIA Factbook they account for 18 percent of the Turkish population. They are predominantly distributed in the southeastern corner of the country.

The best available estimate of the number of persons in Turkey speaking the Kurdish language is about five million (1980). About 3,950,000 others speak Northern Kurdish (Kurmanji) (1980). While population increase suggests that the number of speakers has grown, it is also true that the ban on the use of the language in Turkey was only lifted in 1991 and still exists in most official settings (including schools), and that many fewer ethnic Kurds live in the countryside where the language has traditionally been used. The number of speakers is clearly less than the 15 million or so persons who identify themselves as ethnic Kurds.

From 1915 to 1918, Kurds struggled to end Ottoman rule over their region. They were encouraged by Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s support for non-Turkish nationalities of the empire and submitted their claim for independence to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. The Treaty of Sèvres stipulated the creation of an autonomous Kurdish state in 1920, but the subsequent Treaty of Lausanne (1923) failed to mention Kurds. After the Sheikh Said rebellion was suppressed in 1925, Kemal Atatürk established a Reform Council for the East () which prepared the Report for Reform in the East () which encouraged the creation of Inspectorates-Generals (, UMs), in the areas comprising a majority Kurdish population. Following there were established three regional Inspectorates Generals comprising the Kurdish provinces, the Inspectorates General were ruled with Martial Law and Kurdish notables in the areas were meant to be resettled to the west of Turkey. The Inspectorates Generals were disestablished in 1952.

During the relatively open government of the 1950s, Kurds gained political office and started working within the framework of the Turkish Republic to further their interests but this move towards integration was halted with the 1960 Turkish coup d&#x27;état. The 1970s saw an evolution in Kurdish nationalism as Marxist political thought influenced a new generation of Kurdish nationalists opposed to the local feudal authorities who had been a traditional source of opposition to authority, eventually they would form the militant separatist PKK, or Kurdistan Workers Party in English.

Following these events, Turkey officially denied the existence of the Kurds or an other distinct ethnic groups and any expression by the Kurds of their ethnic identity was harshly repressed. Until 1991, the use of the Kurdish language – although widespread – was illegal. As a result of reforms inspired by the EU, music, radio and television broadcasts in Kurdish are now allowed albeit with severe time restrictions (for example, radio broadcasts can be no longer than sixty minutes per day nor can they constitute more than five hours per week while television broadcasts are subject to even greater restrictions). Additionally, education in Kurdish is now permitted though only in private institutions.

As late as 1994, however, Leyla Zana, the first female Kurdish representative in Grand National Assembly of Turkey, was charged with making &quot;separatist speeches&quot; and sentenced to 15 years in prison. At her inauguration as an MP, she reportedly identified herself as a Kurd. Amnesty International reported that &quot;[s]he took the oath of loyalty in Turkish, as required by law, then added in Kurdish, &#x27;I shall struggle so that the Kurdish and Turkish peoples may live together in a democratic framework.&#x27; In response to this, calls for her arrest blaming her of being a &quot;Separatist&quot; and &quot;Terrorist&quot; were heard in the Turkish parliament.

The Partiya Karkerên Kurdistan (PKK), also known as &quot;KADEK&quot; and &quot;Kongra-Gel&quot; is Kurdish militant organization which has waged an armed struggle against the Turkish state for cultural and political rights and self-determination for the Kurds. Turkey&#x27;s military allies the US, the EU, and NATO see the PKK as a terrorist organization.

From 1984 to 1999, the PKK and the Turkish military engaged in open war, and much of the countryside in the southeast was depopulated, with Kurdish civilians moving to local defensible centers such as Diyarbakır, Van, and Şırnak, as well as to the cities of western Turkey and even to western Europe. The causes of the depopulation included PKK atrocities against Kurdish clans who they could not control, the poverty of the southeast, and the Turkish state&#x27;s military operations. Human Rights Watch has documented many instances where the Turkish military forcibly destroyed houses and villages. An estimated 3,000 Kurdish villages in Turkey were virtually wiped off the map, representing the displacement of more than 378,000 people.

Nelson Mandela refused to accept the &quot;Atatürk Peace Award&quot; in 1992 because of the oppression of the Kurds, but later accepted the award in 1999.

===Iraq===
Kurds make up around 17% of Iraq&#x27;s population. They are the majority in at least three provinces in Northern Iraq which are known as Iraqi Kurdistan. There are around 300,000 Kurds living in the Iraqi capital Baghdad, 50,000 in the city of Mosul and around 100,000 Kurds living elsewhere in Southern Iraq. Kurds led by Mustafa Barzani were engaged in heavy fighting against successive Iraqi regimes from 1960 to 1975. In March 1970, Iraq announced a peace plan providing for Kurdish autonomy. The plan was to be implemented in four years. However, at the same time, the Iraqi regime started an Arabization program in the oil rich regions of Kirkuk and Khanaqin. The peace agreement did not last long, and in 1974, the Iraqi government began a new offensive against the Kurds. Moreover, in March 1975, Iraq and Iran signed the Algiers Accord, according to which Iran cut supplies to Iraqi Kurds. Iraq started another wave of Arabization by moving Arabs to the oil fields in northern Iraq, particularly those around Kirkuk. Between 1975 and 1978, 200,000 Kurds were deported to other parts of Iraq.

During the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s, the regime implemented anti-Kurdish policies and a &quot;de facto&quot; civil war broke out. Iraq was widely condemned by the international community, but was never seriously punished for oppressive measures such as the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of civilians, the wholesale destruction of thousands of villages and the deportation of thousands of Kurds to southern and central Iraq. The campaign of Iraqi government against Kurds in 1988 was called &quot;Anfal&quot; (&quot;Spoils of War&quot;). The Anfal attacks led to destruction of two thousand villages and death of between 50 and 100,000 Kurds.

After the Kurdish uprising in 1991 () led by the PUK and KDP, Iraqi troops recaptured the Kurdish areas and hundreds of thousand of Kurds fled to the borders. To alleviate the situation, a &quot;safe haven&quot; was established by the Security Council. The autonomous Kurdish area was mainly controlled by the rival parties KDP and PUK. The Kurdish population welcomed the American troops in 2003 by holding celebrations and dancing in the streets. The area controlled by peshmerga was expanded, and Kurds had effective control in Kirkuk and parts of Mosul. By the beginning of 2006, the two Kurdish areas were merged into one unified region. A series of referendums were scheduled to be held in 2007, to determine the final borders of the Kurdish region.

In early June 2010, following a visit to Turkey by one of the PKK leaders, the PKK announced an end to the cease fire, followed by an air attack on several border villages and rebel positions by the Turkish air force.

On 11 July 2014 KRG forces seized control of the Bai Hassan and Kirkuk oilfields, prompting a condemnation from Baghdad and a threat of &quot;dire consequences&quot;, if the oilfields were not relinquished back to Iraq&#x27;s control. The 2017 Kurdistan Region independence referendum took place on 25 September, with 92.73% voting in favor of independence. This triggered a military operation in which the Iraqi government retook control of Kirkuk and surrounding areas, and forced the KRG to annul the referendum.

===Iran===
The Kurdish region of Iran has been a part of the country since ancient times. Nearly all of Kurdistan was part of the Iranian Empire until its western part was lost during the wars against the Ottoman Empire. Following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, at the Paris Conferences in 1919, Tehran demanded various territories including Turkish Kurdistan, Mosul, and even Diyarbakır, but these demands were quickly rejected by Western powers. Instead, the Kurdish area was divided by modern Turkey, Syria and Iraq. Today, the Kurds inhabit mostly North-Western Iran but also parts of Khorasan, and constitute approximately 7–10% of Iran&#x27;s overall population (6.5–7.9 million), compared to 10.6% (2 million) in 1956 or 8% (800,000) in 1850.

Unlike in other Kurdish-populated countries, there are very strong ethno-linguistical, historical and cultural ties between Kurds and others as Iranian peoples. Some of modern Iranian dynasties like Safavids and Zands are considered to be partly of Kurdish origin. Kurdish literature in all of its forms (Kurmanji, Sorani and Gorani) has been developed within historical Iranian boundaries under strong influence of Persian language. Due to Kurds sharing a common history, very close cultural and linguistic links as well as common origins with the rest of Iran, this is seen as a reason why Kurdish leaders in Iran do not want a separate Kurdish state.

The government of Iran has always been implacably opposed to any sign of independence for the Iranian Kurds. During and shortly after the First World War, the government of Iran was ineffective and had very little control over events in the country and several Kurdish tribal chiefs gained local political power, and established large confederations. In the same time, a wave of nationalism from the disintegrating Ottoman Empire has partly influenced some Kurdish chiefs in border region, and they posed as Kurdish nationalist leaders. Prior to this, identity in both countries largely relied upon religion i.e. Shia Islam in the particular case of Iran. In 19th century Iran, Shia–Sunni animosity and describing Sunni Kurds as Ottoman fifth column was quite frequent.

During the late 1910s and early 1920s, tribal revolt led by Kurdish chieftain Simko Shikak swept across Iranian Kurdistan. Although elements of Kurdish nationalism were present in the movement, historians agree they were hardly articulate enough to justify a claim that recognition of Kurdish identity was a major issue in Simko&#x27;s movement, and he had to rely heavily on conventional tribal motives. Government forces and non-Kurds were not the only ones to have allegedly been attacked, the Kurdish population was also robbed and assaulted. The fighters do not appear to have felt any sense of unity or solidarity with fellow Kurds. Kurdish insurgency and seasonal migrations in the late 1920s, along with long-running tensions between Tehran and Ankara, resulted in border clashes and even military penetrations in both Iranian and Turkish territory. Two regional powers have used Kurdish tribes as tool for own political benefits: Turkey has provided military help and refuge for anti-Iranian Turcophone Shikak rebels in 1918–1922, while Iran did the same during Ararat rebellion against Turkey in 1930. The Iranian government&#x27;s forced detribalization and sedentarization in the 1920s and 1930s resulted in many tribal revolts in Iranian regions such as Azerbaijan, Luristan and Kurdistan. In particular case of the Kurds, these policies partly contributed to developing revolts among some tribes.

As a response to growing Pan-Turkism and Pan-Arabism in region which were seen as potential threats to the territorial integrity of Iran, Pan-Iranist ideology has been developed in the early 1920s. Some of such groups and journals openly advocated Iranian support to the Kurdish opposition against Turkey. Pahlavi dynasty has endorsed Iranian ethnic nationalism which allegedly seen the Kurds as integral part of the Iranian nation. Another significant ideology during this period was Marxism which arose among Kurds under influence of the USSR. It culminated in the Iran crisis of 1946 which included a bold attempt KDP-I and communist groups to try to gain autonomy to establish the Soviet puppet government called Republic of Mahabad. It arose along with Azerbaijan People&#x27;s Government, another Soviet puppet state. The state itself encompassed a very small territory, including Mahabad and the adjacent cities, unable to incorporate the southern Iranian Kurdistan which fell inside the Anglo-American zone, and unable to attract the tribes outside Mahabad itself to the nationalist cause. As a result, when the Soviets withdrew from Iran in December 1946, government forces were able to enter Mahabad unopposed when the tribes betrayed the republic.

Several Marxist insurgencies continued for decades (1967, 1979, 1989–96) led by KDP-I and Komalah, but those two organization have never advocated a Kurdish country as did the PKK in Turkey. Still, many dissident leaders, among others Qazi Muhammad and Abdul Rahman Ghassemlou, were executed or assassinated. During Iran–Iraq War, Tehran has provided support for Iraqi-based Kurdish groups like KDP or PUK, along with asylum for 1,400,000 Iraqi refugees, mostly Kurds. Although Kurdish Marxist groups have been marginalized in Iran since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in 2004 new insurrection has been started by PJAK, separatist organization affiliated with the Turkey-based PKK and designated as terrorist by Iran, Turkey and the United States. Some analysts claim that the PJAK does not pose any serious threat to the government of Iran. Cease-fire has been established in September 2011 following the Iranian offensive on PJAK bases, but several clashes between PJAK and IRGC took place after it. Since the Iranian revolution of 1979, accusations of discrimination by Western organizations and of foreign involvement by the Iranian side have become very frequent.

Kurds have been well integrated in Iranian political life during the reign of various governments. During the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi some members of parliament and high army officers were Kurds, and there was even a Kurdish Cabinet Minister. During Pahlavi reign Kurds allegedly received many favours from the authorities, for instance to keep their land after the land reforms of 1962. In the early 2000s, the supposed presence of thirty Kurdish deputies in the 290-strong parliament has allegedly shown that Kurds have a say in Iranian politics. Some of influential Kurdish politicians during recent years include former first vice president Mohammad Reza Rahimi and Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, Mayor of Tehran and second-placed presidential candidate in 2013. Kurdish language is today used more than at any other time since the revolution, including in several newspapers and among schoolchildren. Large numbers of Kurds in Iran show no interest in Kurdish nationalism, especially Shia Kurds, and even vigorously reject the idea of autonomy, preferring direct rule from Tehran. Iranian national identity is questioned only in the peripheral Kurdish Sunni regions.

===Syria===

Kurds and other Non-Arabs account for ten percent of Syria&#x27;s population, a total of around 1.9 million people. This makes them the largest ethnic minority in the country. They are mostly concentrated in the northeast and the north, but there are also significant Kurdish populations in Aleppo and Damascus. Kurds often speak Kurdish in public, unless all those present do not. Kurdish human rights activists are mistreated and persecuted. No political parties are allowed for any group, Kurdish or otherwise.

Techniques used to suppress the ethnic identity of Kurds in Syria include various bans on the use of the Kurdish language, refusal to register children with Kurdish names, the replacement of Kurdish place names with new names in Arabic, the prohibition of businesses that do not have Arabic names, the prohibition of Kurdish private schools, and the prohibition of books and other materials written in Kurdish. Having been denied the right to Syrian nationality, around 300,000 Kurds have been deprived of any social rights, in violation of international law. As a consequence, these Kurds are in effect trapped within Syria. In February 2006, however, sources reported that Syria was now planning to grant these Kurds citizenship.

On 12 March 2004, beginning at a stadium in Qamishli (a city in northeastern Syria where many Kurds live), clashes between Kurds and Syrians broke out and continued over a number of days. At least thirty people were killed and more than 160 injured. The unrest spread to other Kurdish inhabited towns along the northern border with Turkey, and then to Damascus and Aleppo.

===Armenia===

Between the 1920s and 1990s, Armenia was a part of the Soviet Union, within which Kurds, like other ethnic groups, had the status of a protected minority. Armenian Kurds were permitted their own state-sponsored newspaper, radio broadcasts and cultural events. During the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, many non-Yazidis and Kurds were forced to leave their homes. Following the end of the Soviet Union, Kurds in Armenia were stripped of their cultural privileges and most fled to Russia or Western Europe. Recently introduced Electoral System of the Armenian National Assembly reserves one seat in the parliament to the representative of the Kurdish minority.

===Republic of Azerbaijan===

In 1920, two Kurdish-inhabited areas of Jewanshir (capital Kalbajar) and eastern Zangazur (capital Lachin) were combined to form the Kurdistan Okrug (or &quot;Red Kurdistan&quot;). The period of existence of the Kurdish administration was brief and did not last beyond 1929. Kurds subsequently faced many repressive measures, including deportations. As a result of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, many Kurdish areas have been destroyed and more than 150,000 Kurds have been deported by the Armenian forces since 1988.

===Kurds in Jordan, Syria, Egypt and Lebanon===

The Kurdish leader Saladin along with his uncles Ameer Adil and Ameer Sherko, were joined by Kurdish fighters from the cities of Tigrit, Mosul, Erbil and Sharazur in a drive towards &#x27;Sham&#x27; (today&#x27;s Syria and Lebanon) in order to protect Islamic lands against crusader attack. The Kurdish King and his uncles ruled north Iraq, Jordan, Syria and Egypt for a short period. Salah El Din in Syria, Ameer Sherko in Egypt and Ameer Adil in Jordan, with family members ruling most of the cities of today&#x27;s Iraq. The Kurds built many monumental castles in the lands which they ruled, especially in what was called &#x27;Kurdistan of Syria&#x27; and in Damuscus, the capital of Syria. A tall building, called &#x27;Qalha&#x27;, is still standing, in the mid south-west quarter of Damascus. The Ayubian dynasty continued there for many years, all from Kurdish descent.

==Genetics==

Although the Kurds came under the successive dominion of various conquerors, including the Armenians, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Ottoman Turks, Sassanid Persians, and Achaemenid Persians they may have remained relatively unmixed by the influx of invaders, because of their protected and inhospitable mountainous homeland.

===Similarity to Europeans and peoples of the Caucasus===
A study by Richards and colleagues of mitochondrial DNA in the Near East found that Kurds, Azerbaijanis, Ossetians and Armenians show a high incidence of mtDNA U5 lineages, which are common among Europeans, although rare elsewhere in the Near East. The sample of Kurds in this study came from northwest Iran and northeast Iraq, where Kurds usually predominate.

A geographically broad study of the Southwest and Central Asian Corridor found that populations located west of the Indus Valley mainly harbor mtDNAs of Western Eurasian origin.

When Ivan Nasidze and his colleagues examined both mitochondrial and Y chromosome DNA, they found Kurdish groups most similar genetically to other West Asian groups, and most distant from Central Asian groups, for both mtDNA and the Y chromosome. However, Kurdish groups show a closer relationship with European groups than with Caucasian groups based on mtDNA, but the opposite based on the Y chromosome, indicating some differences in their maternal and paternal histories.

====Similarity to Azerbaijanis of Iran====
According to DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1 allele frequencies showed a strong genetic tie between Kurds and Azerbaijanis of Iran. According to the current results, present-day Kurds and Azerbaijanis of Iran seem to belong to a common genetic pool.

====Similarity to Georgian people====
David Comas and colleagues found that mitochondrial sequence pools in Georgians and Kurds are very similar, despite their different linguistic and prehistoric backgrounds. Both populations present mtDNA lineages that clearly belong to the Western Eurasian gene pool.

===Similarity to Jewish people===
In 2001 Nebel et al. compared three Jewish and three non-Jewish groups from the Middle East: Ashkenazim, Sephardim, and Kurdish Jews from Israel; Muslim Arabs from Israel and the Palestinian Authority Area; Bedouin from the Negev; and Muslim Kurds. They concluded that Kurdish and Sephardi Jews were indistinguishable from one another, whereas both differed slightly, yet noticeably, from Ashkenazi Jews. Nebel et al. had earlier (2000) found a large genetic relationship between Jews and Palestinian Arabs, but in this study found an even higher relationship of Jews with Iraqi Kurds. They conclude that the common genetic background shared by Jews and other Middle Eastern groups predates the division of Middle Easterners into different ethnic groups.

Nebel et al. (2001) also found that the Cohen modal haplotype, considered the most definitive Jewish haplotype, was found among 10.1% of Kurdish Jews, 7.6% of Ashkenazim, 6.4% of Sephardim, 2.1% of Palestinian Arabs, and 1.1% of Kurds. The Cohen modal haplotype and the most frequent Kurdish haplotype were the same on five markers (out of six) and very close on the other marker. The most frequent Kurdish haplotype was shared by 9.5% of Kurds, 2.6% of Sephardim, 2.0% of Kurdish Jews, 1.4% of Palestinian Arabs, and 1.3% of Ashkenazim. The general conclusion is that these similarities result mostly from the sharing of ancient genetic patterns, and not from more recent admixture between the groups.

<text>In relational database theory, a functional dependency is the following constraint between two attribute sets in a relation: Given a relation &quot;R&quot; and attribute sets &quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot; formula_1 &quot;R&quot;, &quot;X&quot; is said to functionally determine &quot;Y&quot; (written &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;) if each &quot;X&quot; value is associated with precisely one &quot;Y&quot; value. &quot;R&quot; is then said to satisfy the functional dependency &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;. Equivalently, the projection formula_2 is a function, that is, &quot;Y&quot; is a function of &quot;X&quot;. In simple words, if the values for the &quot;X&quot; attributes are known (say they are &quot;x&quot;), then the values for the &quot;Y&quot; attributes corresponding to &quot;x&quot; can be determined by looking them up in &quot;any&quot; tuple of &quot;R&quot; containing &quot;x&quot;. Customarily &quot;X&quot; is called the &quot;determinant&quot; set and &quot;Y&quot; the &quot;dependent&quot; set. A functional dependency FD: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is called &quot;trivial&quot; if &quot;Y&quot; is a subset of &quot;X&quot;.

In other words, a dependency FD: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; means that the values of &quot;Y&quot; are determined by the values of &quot;X&quot;. Two tuples sharing the same values of &quot;X&quot; will necessarily have the same values of &quot;Y&quot;.

The determination of functional dependencies is an important part of designing databases in the relational model, and in database normalization and denormalization. A simple application of functional dependencies is Heath&#x27;s theorem; it says that a relation &quot;R&quot; over an attribute set &quot;U&quot; and satisfying a functional dependency &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; can be safely split in two relations having the lossless-join decomposition property, namely into formula_3 where &quot;Z&quot; = &quot;U&quot; − &quot;XY&quot; are the rest of the attributes. (Unions of attribute sets are customarily denoted by their juxtapositions in database theory.) An important notion in this context is a candidate key, defined as a minimal set of attributes that functionally determine all of the attributes in a relation. The functional dependencies, along with the attribute domains, are selected so as to generate constraints that would exclude as much data inappropriate to the user domain from the system as possible.

A notion of logical implication is defined for functional dependencies in the following way: a set of functional dependencies formula_4 logically implies another set of dependencies formula_5, if any relation &quot;R&quot; satisfying all dependencies from formula_4 also satisfies all dependencies from formula_5; this is usually written formula_8. The notion of logical implication for functional dependencies admits a sound and complete finite axiomatization, known as Armstrong&#x27;s axioms.

== Examples ==

=== Cars ===
Suppose one is designing a system to track vehicles and the capacity of their engines. Each vehicle has a unique vehicle identification number (VIN). One would write &quot;VIN&quot; → &quot;EngineCapacity&quot; because it would be inappropriate for a vehicle&#x27;s engine to have more than one capacity. (Assuming, in this case, that vehicles only have one engine.) On the other hand, &quot;EngineCapacity&quot; → &quot;VIN&quot; is incorrect because there could be many vehicles with the same engine capacity.

This functional dependency may suggest that the attribute EngineCapacity be placed in a relation with candidate key VIN. However, that may not always be appropriate. For example, if that functional dependency occurs as a result of the transitive functional dependencies VIN → VehicleModel and VehicleModel → EngineCapacity then that would not result in a normalized relation.

=== Lectures ===
This example illustrates the concept of functional dependency. The situation modelled is that of college students visiting one or more lectures in each of which they are assigned a teaching assistant (TA). Let&#x27;s further assume that every student is in some semester and is identified by a unique integer ID.

We notice that whenever two rows in this table feature the same StudentID,
they also necessarily have the same Semester values. This basic fact
can be expressed by a functional dependency:
* StudentID → Semester.

If a row was added where the student had a different value of semester, then the functional dependency FD would no longer exist. This means that the FD is implied by the data as it is possible to have values that would invalidate the FD. 

Other nontrivial functional dependencies can be identified, for example:
* {StudentID, Lecture} → TA
* {StudentID, Lecture} → {TA, Semester}

The latter expresses the fact that the set {StudentID, Lecture} is a superkey of the relation.

=== Employee department ===

A classic example of functional dependency is the employee department model. 

This case represents an example where multiple functional dependencies are embedded in a single representation of data. Note that because an employee can only be a member of one department, the unique ID of that employee determines the department.

* Employee ID → Employee Name
* Employee ID → Department ID

In addition to this relationship, the table also has a functional dependency through a non-key attribute

* Department ID → Department Name

This example demonstrates that even though there exists a FD Employee ID → Department ID - the employee ID would not be a logical key for determination of the department Name. The process of normalization of the data would recognize all FDs and allow the designer to construct tables and relationships that are more logical based on the data.

== Properties and axiomatization of functional dependencies ==

Given that &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot; are sets of attributes in a relation &quot;R&quot;, one can derive several properties of functional dependencies. Among the most important are the following, usually called Armstrong&#x27;s axioms:
* Reflexivity: If &quot;Y&quot; is a subset of &quot;X&quot;, then &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; 
* Augmentation: If &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;, then &quot;XZ&quot; → &quot;YZ&quot;
* Transitivity: If &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Z&quot;, then &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Z&quot;

&quot;Reflexivity&quot; can be weakened to just formula_9, i.e. it is an actual axiom, where the other two are proper inference rules, more precisely giving rise to the following rules of syntactic consequence:

formula_10
formula_11
formula_12.

These three rules are a sound and complete axiomatization of functional dependencies. This axiomatization is sometimes described as finite because the number of inference rules is finite, with the caveat that the axiom and rules of inference are all schemata, meaning that the &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; range over all ground terms (attribute sets).

By applying augmentation and transitivity, one can derive two additional rules:
* Pseudotransitivity: If &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;YW&quot; → &quot;Z&quot;, then &quot;XW&quot; → &quot;Z&quot;
* Composition: If &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; → &quot;W&quot;, then &quot;XZ&quot; → &quot;YW&quot;

One can also derive the union and decomposition rules from Armstrong&#x27;s axioms:
:&quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Z&quot; if and only if &quot;X&quot; → &quot;YZ&quot;

== Closure ==

=== Closure of functional dependency ===
The closure of a set of values is the set of attributes that can be determined using its functional dependencies for a given relationship. One uses Armstrong&#x27;s axioms to provide a proof - i.e. reflexivity, augmentation, transitivity.

Given formula_13 and formula_14 a set of FDs that holds in formula_13:
The closure of formula_14 in formula_13 (denoted formula_14+) is the set of all FDs that are logically implied by formula_14.

=== Closure of a set of attributes ===
Closure of a set of attributes X with respect to formula_14 is the set X+ of all attributes that are functionally determined by X using formula_14+.

==== Example ====
Imagine the following list of FDs. We are going to calculate a closure for A (written as A+) from this relationship.

# &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot;
# &quot;B&quot; → &quot;C&quot;
# &quot;AB&quot; → &quot;D&quot;

The closure would be as follows:

Therefore, A+= ABCD. Because A+ includes every attribute in the relationship, it is a superkey.

== Covers and equivalence ==

=== Covers ===
Definition: formula_14 covers formula_23 if every FD in formula_23 can be inferred from formula_14. formula_14 covers formula_23 if formula_23+ ⊆ formula_14+ 
Every set of functional dependencies has a canonical cover.

=== Equivalence of two sets of FDs ===
Two sets of FDs formula_14 and formula_23 over schema formula_13 are equivalent, written formula_14 ≡ formula_23, if formula_14+ = formula_23+. If formula_14 ≡ formula_23, then formula_14 is a cover for formula_23 and vice versa. In other words, equivalent sets of functional dependencies are called &quot;covers&quot; of each other.

=== Non-redundant covers ===
A set formula_14 of FDs is nonredundant if there is no proper subset 
formula_42 of formula_14 with formula_42 ≡ formula_14. If such an formula_42 exists, formula_14 is redundant. formula_14 is a nonredundant cover for formula_23 if formula_14 is a cover for formula_23 and formula_14 is nonredundant.

An alternative characterization of nonredundancy is that formula_14 is nonredundant if there is no FD &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; in formula_14 such that formula_55 - {&quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;} formula_56 &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;. Call an FD &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; in formula_14 redundant in formula_14 if formula_55 - {&quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;} formula_56 &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;.

== Applications to normalization ==

=== Heath&#x27;s theorem ===
An important property (yielding an immediate application) of functional dependencies is that if &quot;R&quot; is a relation with columns named from some set of attributes &quot;U&quot; and &quot;R&quot; satisfies some functional dependency &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; then formula_61 where &quot;Z&quot; = &quot;U&quot; − &quot;XY&quot;. Intuitively, if a functional dependency &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; holds in &quot;R&quot;, then the relation can be safely split in two relations alongside the column &quot;X&quot; (which is a key for formula_62) ensuring that when the two parts are joined back no data is lost, i.e. a functional dependency provides a simple way to construct a lossless join decomposition of &quot;R&quot; in two smaller relations. This fact is sometimes called &quot;Heaths theorem&quot;; it is one of the early results in database theory.

Heath&#x27;s theorem effectively says we can pull out the values of &quot;Y&quot; from the big relation &quot;R&quot; and store them into one, formula_63, which has no value repetitions in the row for &quot;X&quot; and is effectively a lookup table for &quot;Y&quot; keyed by &quot;X&quot; and consequently has only one place to update the &quot;Y&quot; corresponding to each &quot;X&quot; unlike the &quot;big&quot; relation &quot;R&quot; where there are potentially many copies of each &quot;X&quot;, each one with its copy of &quot;Y&quot; which need to be kept synchronized on updates. (This elimination of redundancy is an advantage in OLTP contexts, where many changes are expected, but not so much in OLAP contexts, which involve mostly queries.) Heath&#x27;s decomposition leaves only &quot;X&quot; to act as a foreign key in the remainder of the big table formula_64.

Functional dependencies however should not be confused with inclusion dependencies, which are the formalism for foreign keys; even though they are used for normalization, functional dependencies express constraints over one relation (schema), whereas inclusion dependencies express constraints between relation schemas in a database schema. Furthermore, the two notions do not even intersect in the classification of dependencies: functional dependencies are equality-generating dependencies whereas inclusion dependencies are tuple-generating dependencies. Enforcing referential constraints after relation schema decomposition (normalization) requires a new formalism, i.e. inclusion dependencies. In the decomposition resulting from Heath&#x27;s theorem, there is nothing preventing the insertion of tuples in formula_64 having some value of &quot;X&quot; not found in formula_63.

=== Normal forms ===
Normal forms are database normalization levels which determine the &quot;goodness&quot; of a table. Generally, the third normal form is considered to be a &quot;good&quot; standard for a relational database.

Normalization aims to free the database from update, insertion and deletion anomalies. It also ensures that when a new value is introduced into the relation, it has minimal effect on the database, and thus minimal effect on the applications using the database.

== Irreducible function depending set ==
A set S of functional dependencies is irreducible if the set has the following three properties:

# Each right set of a functional dependency of S contains only one attribute.
# Each left set of a functional dependency of S is irreducible. It means that reducing any one attribute from left set will change the content of S (S will lose some information).
# Reducing any functional dependency will change the content of S.

Sets of functional dependencies with these properties are also called &quot;canonical&quot; or &quot;minimal&quot;. Finding such a set S of functional dependencies which is equivalent to some input set S&#x27; provided as input is called finding a &quot;minimal cover&quot; of S&#x27;: this problem can be solved in polynomial time.

<text>William B. Ellern (November 30, 1933 – November 18, 2023) was an American engineer and science fiction author. 

Ellern was born in Portland, Oregon to William C. Ellern and May Eileen Ellern. He worked as an engineer, including for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Raytheon, Boeing, Hughes Aircraft and Northrop Corporation.

In July 1965, he asked for, and received, permission from E. E. Smith to extend the &quot;Lensman series&quot; of novels. After that he produced several science-fiction stories, including &quot;Moon Prospector&quot; (&quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot;, 1966), &quot;New Lensman&quot; (serialized in 14 parts in &quot;Perry Rhodan&quot; #61-74, 1975) and &quot;Triplanetary Agent&quot; (serialized in 6 parts in &quot;Perry Rhodan&quot; #100-105, 1978). There is also a fourth story, unpublished.

In 1976, the collection &quot;New Lensman&quot; was published, which contained &quot;Moon Prospector&quot; along with the &quot;New Lensman&quot; serial from &quot;Perry Rhodan&quot;. &quot;Triplanetary Agent&quot; has yet to be reprinted in book form.

Ellern served on the board of directors of the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society until January 2009.

Ellern married Anne Morrel. He had four children, William A., Scott A., Gillian D. and Lorita E.

<doc id="205786" wikidata="Q517435" url="?curid=205786" title="Janet Asimov">
<text>Janet Opal Asimov (née Jeppson; August 6, 1926 – February 25, 2019), usually writing as J. O. Jeppson, was an American science fiction writer, psychiatrist, and psychoanalyst.

She started writing children&#x27;s science fiction in the 1970s. She was married to Isaac Asimov from 1973 until his death in 1992, and they collaborated on a number of science fiction books aimed at young readers, including the Norby series. She died in February 2019 at the age of 92.

==Education and career==
Jeppson earned a B.A. degree from Stanford University (first attending Wellesley College), her M.D. degree from New York University Medical School, completing a residency in psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital. In 1960, she graduated from the William Alanson White Institute of Psychoanalysis, where she continued to work until 1986. After her marriage to Isaac Asimov, she continued to practice psychiatry and psychoanalysis under the name Janet O. Jeppson, and she published medical papers under that name.

== Writing ==
Janet Asimov&#x27;s first published writing was a &quot;mystery short&quot; sold to Hans Stefan Santesson for &quot;The Saint Mystery Magazine&quot;, which appeared in the May 1966 issue. Her first novel was &quot;The Second Experiment&quot; in 1974; Asimov wrote mostly science fiction novels for children throughout her career. As a psychiatrist she incorporated aspects of psychoanalysis, human identity, and other psychiatry-related ideas in her writing. According to Isaac Asimov, the books that Janet Asimov wrote in association with him were 90 percent Janet&#x27;s, and his name was wanted on the books by the publisher &quot;for the betterment of sales&quot;. After Isaac&#x27;s death, she took on the writing of his syndicated popular-science column in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

== Husband ==
Janet Jeppson began dating Isaac Asimov in 1970 immediately following his separation from Gertrude Blugerman. They were married on November 30, 1973, two weeks after Asimov&#x27;s divorce from Gertrude. Despite Jeppson&#x27;s upbringing in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, their marriage was officiated by a leader of Ethical Culture, a humanist religious group that Janet later joined. On the same day, she learned that her first novel, &quot;The Second Experiment&quot;, would be published (under her maiden name).

Their marriage lasted until Isaac&#x27;s death in 1992 from complications relating to HIV, contracted from a 1983 blood transfusion during bypass surgery. Janet reportedly consulted medical texts after Isaac began exhibiting symptoms, and she requested an HIV test be performed. His doctors insisted she was wrong and only tested Isaac for the infection after he became seriously ill. She wanted the information made public, but doctors insisted upon not disclosing it, even after Isaac died. After the doctors advising silence had all died, Janet Asimov went public with the knowledge.

<text>Charles William Beebe ( ; July 29, 1877 – June 4, 1962) was an American naturalist, ornithologist, marine biologist, entomologist, explorer, and author. He is remembered for the numerous expeditions he conducted for the New York Zoological Society, such as the &quot;Arcturus&quot; mission, his deep dives in the Bathysphere, and his prolific scientific writing for academic and popular audiences.

Born in Brooklyn, New York and raised in East Orange, New Jersey, Beebe left college before obtaining a degree to work at the then newly opened New York Zoological Park, where he was given the duty of caring for the zoo&#x27;s birds. He quickly distinguished himself in his work for the zoo, first with his skill in designing habitats for its bird population, and soon also with a series of research expeditions of increasing length, including an expedition around the world to document the world&#x27;s pheasants. These expeditions formed the basis for a large quantity of writing for both popular and academic audiences, including an account of his pheasant expedition titled &quot;A Monograph of the Pheasants&quot; and published in four volumes from 1918 to 1922. In recognition of the research conducted on his expeditions, he was granted honorary doctorates from Tufts an Colgate University.

During the course of his expeditions, Beebe gradually developed an interest in marine biology, ultimately leading to his 1930s dives in the Bathysphere, along with its inventor, Otis Barton, off the coast of Bermuda. This was the first time a biologist observed deep-sea animals in their native environment and set several successive records for the deepest dive ever performed by a human, the deepest of which stood until it was broken by Barton 15 years later. Following his Bathysphere dives, Beebe returned to the tropics and began to focus his study on the behavior of insects. In 1949, he founded a tropical research station in Trinidad and Tobago which he named Simla, and which remains in operation as part of the Asa Wright Nature Centre. Beebe&#x27;s research at Simla continued until his death from pneumonia in 1962 at the age of 84.

William Beebe is regarded as one of the founders of the field of ecology, as well as one of the early 20th century&#x27;s major advocates of conservation. He is also remembered for several theories he proposed about avian evolution which are now regarded as having been ahead of their time, particularly his 1915 hypothesis that the evolution of bird flight passed through a four-winged or &quot;Tetrapteryx&quot; stage, which has been supported by the 2003 discovery of &quot;Microraptor gui&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===

Charles William Beebe was born in Brooklyn, New York, son of the newspaper executive Charles Beebe. Although some sources have described him as an only child, he had a younger brother named John who died in infancy. Early in his life, his family moved to East Orange, New Jersey, where he began to acquire both his fascination with the natural world and his tendency to record everything he saw. The American Museum of Natural History, which opened the year that Beebe was born, fostered Beebe&#x27;s love of nature and was an early influence on him.

In September 1891, Beebe began attending East Orange High School. Although Beebe did not formally drop his first name &quot;Charles&quot; until 1915, before attending high school he was already commonly known as &quot;William Beebe&quot;, as he would be known from this point onward. During his high school years Beebe developed an interest in collecting animals, particularly after receiving his first gun at the age of sixteen, and trained himself in taxidermy to preserve them. When he was unable to collect a specimen for himself, he often obtained it from a supply house known as Lattin&#x27;s, or by trading with other collectors. Beebe&#x27;s first article was published while he was still in high school, a description of a bird called a brown creeper, which appeared in the January 1895 issue of the magazine &quot;Harper&#x27;s Young People&quot;.

In 1896, Beebe was accepted with advanced placement to Columbia University. While attending university, Beebe frequently split his time between the university and the American Museum of Natural history, many of whose researchers were also professors at Columbia. At Columbia he studied under Henry Fairfield Osborn, and developed a close relationship with him which would endure until Osborn&#x27;s death in 1935.

While attending Columbia, Beebe persuaded his professors to sponsor him and several fellow students taking research trips to Nova Scotia, where he continued his hobby of collecting, as well as attempting to photograph difficult-to-observe scenes of birds and other animals. Several of Beebe&#x27;s photographs from these expeditions were purchased by Columbia professors to use as slides during their lectures. During these trips, Beebe also developed an interest in dredging, the practice of using nets to haul up animals that lived deep underwater and attempting to study them before they died or disintegrated. Beebe never applied to receive a degree from Columbia, although years later he was granted honorary doctorates from both Tufts and Colgate University.

===Employment at the Bronx Zoo===

In November 1897, Frank Chapman sponsored Beebe to become an associate member of the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union, and the following month Beebe gave his first professional lecture on ornithology to a society called Uncle Clarence&#x27;s Bergen Point Culture Club. In 1899, although he had completed all of the required courses for a degree in science from Columbia except for mathematics, he decided to forgo his studies in favor of an invitation from Osborn to work at the New York Zoological Park which was about to open. Several factors contributed to this decision, including both excitement at being part of the zoo, and the sense that his studies were putting too much of a strain on his family&#x27;s finances.

 Osborn appointed Beebe to the position of assistant curator of ornithology. As assistant curator, one of his principal jobs was to breed and rear the zoo&#x27;s birds in order to sustain their population. Beebe placed much importance on the birds being given as much space as possible, and proposed the building of a &quot;flying cage&quot; the size of a football field. This was eventually built, although at less than half the size that Beebe had originally requested. While Beebe&#x27;s flying cage was criticized as being based on an inaccurate understanding of birds&#x27; needs, it ultimately proved very successful.

In 1901, Beebe returned to Nova Scotia on his first expedition for the zoo, intending to collect marine animals by searching tide pools and with additional dredging. The following year he was promoted from assistant curator to the rank of a full curator, a post he held until 1918. He then went on to serve as an honorary curator from 1919 to 1962.

On August 6, 1902, Beebe was married to Mary Blair Rice, better known by her pen name Blair Niles. Blair subsequently accompanied Beebe on several of his expeditions, and as a writer herself, frequently assisted Beebe with his own writing. Beebe and Blair regarded their honeymoon, another trip to Nova Scotia, as a further opportunity for collecting.

The following February, Beebe, and Blair went on an expedition to the Florida Keys, because Beebe was suffering from a throat infection and the zoo believed that the warm climate would be beneficial to his health. This expedition was Beebe&#x27;s introduction to the tropics, with which he developed a long-standing fascination. In July 1903, at the request of a lawyer named Louis Whealton whom the zoo&#x27;s director William Temple Hornaday regarded as a potential donor to the zoo, Beebe and Blair went on another expedition to Virginia&#x27;s Barrier Islands. Although it was intended as an expedition for the zoo, Beebe described it as &quot;our third honeymoon this year&quot;.

By the end of 1903, at the age of 26, Beebe had published more than thirty-four articles and photographs in the past year. For his contributions to science, he was elected a fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

===Early exploration and expeditions===

In December 1903, to avert another bout of Beebe&#x27;s throat ailment, Hornaday sent him on an expedition to Mexico which would last until the following April. Since Mexico was still largely unstable at this point, he and Blair traveled on horseback and lived mostly in tents, and both carried revolvers for self-protection. Although the purpose of the expedition was to discover, identify and collect Mexico&#x27;s birds, it has also been described as yet another honeymoon between him and Blair. Beebe&#x27;s first book, titled &quot;Two Bird Lovers in Mexico&quot;, was an account of this expedition. The last chapter was written by Blair and was an explanation of how to plan and execute a vacation in the wilderness. The book was enthusiastically well received.

Beebe&#x27;s second book, &quot;The Bird, Its Form and Function&quot;, was published in 1906. This book was a reworking of a manuscript that Beebe had submitted to Henry Holt in 1902, but which Holt had asked him to expand into a major work on birds. In its finished form it represented a new kind of nature writing in that, although it presented technical information about bird biology and evolution, it did so in a way meant to be accessible to a general audience. It also represented an important turning point for Beebe, because in contrast to his youthful fascination with adding animals to his collection, in this book he was beginning to emphasize the importance of wildlife conservation. Regarding the killing of animals for the sole purpose of collecting, the book states:

Although Beebe continued to shoot animals when it was necessary for examining them scientifically, he no longer regarded adding to a collection as a valid reason to take a life. In 1906 Beebe presented his own collection, which had grown to 990 specimens during his earlier years as a collector, as a gift to the zoo for educational and research purposes. For this gift, he was made a life member of the New York Zoological Society. The same year, he was also elected a fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences.

In 1907, the journal &quot;Zoologica&quot; was founded by Osborn and Hornaday specifically as a place for Beebe to publish his research. The first issue of the journal contained twenty papers, ten of which were written by Beebe, and two more of which were jointly written by him and Lee Saunders Crandall, the zoo&#x27;s assistant curator of birds. The following year Beebe received a promotion from the Zoological Society, placing him on equal footing with the research scientists at the Museum of Natural History. This promotion explicitly granted him two months off each year, for further research expeditions. The first expedition conducted under his new privileges, beginning in February 1908, took him to Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela to research birds and insects. During this expedition Beebe captured 40 live birds for the zoo, belonging to 14 different species.

At this point in his life, Beebe was forming a close friendship with then-president Theodore Roosevelt, which would last until Roosevelt&#x27;s death in 1919. Beebe admired Roosevelt&#x27;s skill as a field naturalist as well as his advocacy of conservation, and Roosevelt&#x27;s fame made his support highly valuable in Beebe&#x27;s scientific endeavors. Roosevelt in turn admired Beebe&#x27;s writing and his respect for the natural world. Roosevelt frequently provided praise for Beebe&#x27;s books, and went on to write introductions to Beebe&#x27;s books &quot;Tropical Wild Life&quot; and &quot;Jungle Peace&quot;.

In February 1909, Beebe and Blair traveled to British Guiana, in the hope that with Roosevelt&#x27;s support, it might be possible to establish a permanent field research station there. Another goal of this expedition was to find and capture a hoatzin, a bird whose clawed wings caused it to be considered an important link in the evolution of birds from reptiles. Beebe made extensive documentation of hoatzin behavior through field glasses, but their plans to capture one were foiled when they had to return home early due to Blair breaking her wrist. Despite their failure to obtain their most sought-after prize, the expedition still returned with 280 live birds of 51 species, 33 of which were new to the zoo, although several of these died or escaped during the long trip back to New York. Beebe summarized this expedition in his book &quot;Our Search for a Wilderness&quot;, which was enthusiastically well-reviewed.

===The pheasant expedition===

In December 1909, businessman and philanthropist Anthony R. Kuser proposed to the zoo that Beebe be allowed to go on a voyage around the world to document the world&#x27;s pheasants, which would be financed by Kuser. Hornaday strongly objected to this proposal, describing Kuser as an &quot;evil genius&quot; who was attempting to steal Beebe away from his duties at the zoo. However, the zoo ultimately decided in Kuser&#x27;s favor, partly because the scientific papers produced by Beebe&#x27;s trip to Guiana had been beneficial to the zoo&#x27;s reputation. Hornaday appointed Crandall as the zoo&#x27;s acting curator of birds, giving him the duty of caring for its birds in Beebe&#x27;s absence. Beebe and Blair left for their expedition accompanied by Robert Bruce Horsfall, whose job would be to provide illustrations of the birds for the book that would hopefully result from this expedition.

After crossing the Atlantic Ocean on the RMS Lusitania to London, where they gathered the supplies they would need for their expedition, Beebe and his team traveled across the Mediterranean Sea to Egypt, through the Suez Canal, and across the Indian Ocean to Ceylon, where they began their task of documenting the native wildfowl. From Ceylon they traveled to Calcutta, with the goal of capturing the species of pheasants which live only in the Himalayas. By this point Beebe was beginning to conflict with Horsfall, who was unaccustomed to such expeditions. After Beebe had finished his documentation in the eastern part of the range, Horsfall refused to accompany Beebe in the western part of the range, causing Beebe to leave him in the town of Jorepokhri and continue his work in the Western Himalayas without him. Horsfall rejoined them in Calcutta, from which they sailed to Indonesia. The next ship took them to Singapore, where Beebe established a base of operations for the next stage of his expedition.

The expedition&#x27;s next destination was Sarawak, on the island of Borneo. By the time they left Sarawak, the conflict between Beebe and Horsfall had grown to such a degree that Beebe decided Horsfall was endangering the expedition and must be sent home. In response to Beebe&#x27;s dismissal, Horsfall retorted that he had been ill-treated by Beebe from the beginning of the expedition and that his subsequent actions had been for the express purpose of revenge. Continuing without Horsfall, Beebe and Blair traveled to Batavia in Java, to the island of Madura just to the north, and to Belitung between Borneo and Sumatra.

Finished in Java, Beebe and his crew sailed north from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur to begin exploring Malaya. After Malaya, the next portion of their expedition took them to Burma, where they arrived in Rangoon and traveled by rail to Myitkyina. In Burma Beebe succumbed temporarily to a bout of depression, and it was several days before he was able to resume working or continue the expedition. He attributed his recovery to the pile of penny dreadful novels he discovered in his bungalow at Pungatong, which he then read constantly for the next few days.

The last portion of Beebe&#x27;s journey took him to China, from which they made an unplanned visit to Japan to escape a riot as well as a surge of bubonic plague. When the plague and riots had subsided, Beebe returned to China to document the local pheasant species, then made a second visit to Japan to study pheasants kept in the Imperial Preserves there. In Japan, Beebe was given two cranes by the Imperial Household in exchange for a pair of swans, which were unknown in Japan.

His expedition was completed after a total of 17 months, Beebe and Blair crossed the Pacific to San Francisco, then crossed the United States to return to their home in New York. Their expedition had obtained live or stuffed specimens of nearly all the pheasants he had sought, and also produced extensive notes about their behavior. Some of these pheasants, such as Sclater&#x27;s impeyan or Himalayan monal, had never before been seen in the wild by Americans or Europeans. Beebe&#x27;s observations of sexual dimorphism in pheasants during this expedition led him to become the first biologist to correctly understand the mechanism by which this aspect of sexual selection operates. based on his observations he also proposed a new evolutionary model of pheasant ancestry, involving a period of rapid diversification followed by more typical and gradual changes. Although this evolutionary model is now taken for granted, in William Beebe&#x27;s time it was a novel idea.

In January 1913, Blair left Beebe for Reno intending to divorce him, since at this time in history it was easier to obtain a divorce in Reno than in most other areas of the United States. The divorce was granted on August 29, 1913, after Blair had spent the minimum requirement of six months as a resident in Reno. Obtaining a divorce in Reno required a person to demonstrate that their spouse had committed either adultery or extreme cruelty; Blair&#x27;s complaint accused Beebe of the latter, claiming that during the pheasant expedition he had threatened to commit suicide by &quot;throwing himself in the river, shooting himself through the roof of the mouth with a revolver, and by cutting his throat with a razor.&quot; Beebe made very little effort to contest the divorce and did not appear in court to offer any testimony. Although newspapers at the time reported Blair&#x27;s accusations uncritically, with headlines such as &quot;Naturalist was cruel&quot;, modern biographers consider it more likely that Blair resorted to hyperbole to make a divorce case. A week after her divorce from Beebe, Blair was remarried to their next-door neighbor Robin Niles, suggesting that the true reason for the divorce may have been cuckoldry. On the other hand, some biographers have suggested that Beebe suffered a nervous breakdown during the expedition and that he may have contributed his own part to Blair&#x27;s alienation.

Blair&#x27;s departure came as a shock to Beebe, and he was severely depressed for more than a year afterward. Despite her assistance during the pheasant expedition, Beebe excised any mention of her from the monograph he was preparing based on the data gathered during it.

By the end of 1914, Beebe&#x27;s pheasant monograph was essentially complete in the manuscript. While the text was written by Beebe, the illustrations were provided by several artists: Robert Bruce Horsfall, who had accompanied Beebe on the expedition, painted the environmental scenes for the illustrations&#x27; backgrounds, while the pheasants themselves were painted by other artists including George Edward Lodge, Charles R. Knight, and Louis Agassiz Fuertes. Due to the elaborate nature of the book&#x27;s color artwork, no American publisher was considered capable of reproducing it. The publisher which Beebe chose for his work was George Witherby and Sons of London, as a result of their success publishing the artwork of John James Audubon. The reproduction of the illustrations themselves was to be handled by several companies in Germany and Austria. Reproductions of the illustrations were in the process of being printed when World War I began, holding up the completion of the project for the next four years.

===Return to Guiana and World War I===
Beebe undertook an expedition to Brazil in 1915, to capture more birds for the zoo. This expedition was an important turning point for Beebe in several ways. Beebe had far more field experience than either of the two others accompanying him on the expedition, G. Inness Hartley and Herbert Atkins, making this his introduction to the role of a mentor. During this expedition, Beebe was also amazed to discover the number and variety of organisms living under a single tree and pioneered the method of studying a small area of wilderness for an extended amount of time. This expedition marked the beginning of a shift for Beebe from ornithology to the study of tropical ecosystems.
In 1916, Beebe traveled to Georgetown in pursuit of his earlier goal of establishing a permanent field research station in Guiana. After following several leads which came to nothing, his goal was realized when George Withers, who owned a rubber plantation on the Mazaruni River, offered him the use of a large house on his property for this purpose. Soon after Beebe and his researchers moved into the plantation house, which was known by the name of Kalacoon, they were paid a visit by Theodore Roosevelt and his family. Roosevelt subsequently wrote an article about the station for Scribner&#x27;s Magazine, which helped to build public support for the station.

The establishment of the Kalacoon research station enabled Beebe to research the ecology of the surrounding jungle in far more detail than had been possible during his earlier expeditions. Using Kalacoon as his base of operations, Beebe performed a novel type of study: methodically dissecting a small area of jungle, and all of the animals which inhabit it, from the top of the canopy to below the ground. In a second study, Beebe performed the same task for a much larger area of jungle, approximately a quarter-mile (0.4  km) square. During his first season at Kalacoon in 1916, Beebe brought back 300 living specimens for the zoo. This time he succeeded at capturing a hoatzin, the bird that he had narrowly missed during his earlier trip to Guiana, although he was unable to keep it alive for the zoo during the trip back to New York.

Beebe summarized his discoveries at Kalacoon in his 1917 book &quot;Tropical Wild Life in British Guiana&quot;, which inspired many other researchers to plan trips to Kalacoon or to establish their own field research stations of the type that Beebe had pioneered.

Beebe was eager to serve in World War I, but at 40 he was considered too old for regular service. With Roosevelt&#x27;s help, he secured a post-training American pilot for a flight squadron on Long Island. His training work was halted when, veering to avoid a photographer who had run in front of his airplane as he landed, he crashed on landing and severely injured his right wrist. During a second trip to Kalacoon while his wrist healed, Beebe was further devastated to discover that due to wartime demand for rubber, the entire jungle surrounding the house had been clear-cut to make room for rubber trees. Since the purpose of Kalacoon station had been to study the jungle, the jungle&#x27;s destruction left Beebe with no choice but to close the station and return with its supplies to New York. Combined with his earlier loss of Blair, the effect of losing Kalacoon plunged Beebe into depression. This did not go unnoticed by Beebe&#x27;s mentor Osborn, who expressed concern about it in a letter to Madison Grant, writing &quot;I find that he is worried and far from well. [...] Without telling him so, we must take care of him.&quot;

In October 1917, Beebe had his opportunity to serve in the war. With the help of a letter of recommendation from Roosevelt, he was given the duty of flying aerial photography planes over German gun emplacements. He also spent time in trenches and accompanied a Canadian Indian platoon on a night raid. Beebe subsequently wrote several articles describing his war experience for Scribner&#x27;s Magazine and Atlantic Monthly. Beebe generally did not make the exact nature of his military service clear in his writings about it, although he expressed his general dismay at the realities of the war. The best-known of these accounts is provided by the opening paragraph of his 1918 book &quot;Jungle Peace&quot;:

Beebe&#x27;s position in the Zoological Society changed in 1918: He was given the title of Honorary Curator of Birds and was made the director of the newly created Department of Tropical Research. With his new position, Beebe no longer had the duty of caring for the zoo&#x27;s animals, freeing him to devote himself fully to his writing and research. Beebe&#x27;s duties as curator were passed to Lee Crandall, the former Assistant Curator who had worked under Beebe, although Crandall continued to rely on Beebe for help treating illness in birds, and caring for the exotic birds brought back from Beebe&#x27;s expeditions.

The first volume of Beebe&#x27;s pheasant monograph was published that fall, although the ongoing war made it unclear when the remaining three volumes would be published. The first volume was highly praised by reviewers, and received the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1918. In January 1919 Roosevelt, who was severely ill by this point, wrote to Beebe from his hospital bed congratulating Beebe on the publication of his monograph. His letter of congratulation to Beebe was the last letter that Roosevelt wrote before his death. Volume II of the monograph was published in 1921, and volumes III and IV were published in 1922. The completed work, titled &quot;A Monograph of the Pheasants&quot;, has been considered by some reviewers to be possibly the greatest ornithological monograph of the twentieth century.

In 1919, Osborn helped secure Beebe a new research station in Guiana to replace Kalacoon: Beebe was offered Kartabo Point, an outpost of a New York-based mining corporation. Beebe was enthusiastic about the new station, and it proved very successful for conducting the same detailed analyses of wildlife within small areas that had been performed at Kalacoon. At Kartabo Beebe discovered the phenomenon known as an ant mill, a column of ants following itself in an endless loop until nearly all of them died of exhaustion.

===Galápagos expeditions===
Beebe was eager to undertake an expedition to the Galápagos Islands, intending to obtain more detailed data in support of evolution than Charles Darwin had been able to collect in his earlier visit. In 1923, Harrison Williams agreed to finance such an expedition, and Beebe was provided with a steam yacht called the &quot;Noma&quot; for this purpose along with a support crew. The support crew included several scientists who had worked with Beebe previously and several artists including the marine painter Harry Hoffman, as well as some of Williams&#x27; friends whose inclusion was a condition for Williams&#x27; agreement to fund the expedition. Passing through the Sargasso Sea on the way to the Galápagos, Beebe was fascinated by the diversity of life that could be found in the sargassum weed floating on the surface and spent several days scooping the weed from the water to examine the creatures that lived in it.

Beebe&#x27;s first expedition to the Galápagos lasted twenty days, broken into two ten-day periods, between which the &quot;Noma&quot; was forced to return to Panama for fresh water and coal. During this expedition he documented the unique ways that animals that inhabit the Galápagos have evolved in response to the absence of predators. The Galápagos animals generally showed no fear of humans, causing the team to have a high degree of success at capturing live specimens for the zoo. Beebe also discovered a previously unknown bay on Genovesa Island (also known as Tower Island) in the Galápagos, which he named Darwin Bay, and documented the diversity of animal life that inhabited it. During the return to New York from this expedition, Beebe continued to dredge animals from the sea, using a pair of new devices he had devised to assist himself with this: a &quot;pulpit&quot;, an iron cage affixed to the bow of the ship that enabled its occupant to examine the surface of the sea more closely; and a &quot;boom walk&quot;, a boom jutting from the side of the ship from which he suspended himself. The book in which Beebe summarized this expedition, titled &quot;Galápagos: World&#x27;s End&quot;, was an instant best-seller and remained on the &quot;New York Times&quot; top ten list for several months.

In 1924, Beebe went on another expedition to his Guiana research station of Kartabo, intending to continue the detailed documentation of the tropical ecosystem that he had begun at Kalacoon. The paper which finally resulted from this study was published in &quot;Zoologica&quot; in 1925 and was the first study of its kind in the developing field of tropical ecology. Beebe continued to battle depression during this trip to Kartabo, both over his earlier loss of Blair, and over the death of his mother Nettie, who had died shortly before the beginning of the expedition.

Despite his ongoing research in Guiana, what Beebe desired most was to return to the Galápagos, this time with a properly fitted-out scientific research vessel that possessed the ability to dredge animals from beneath the ocean. In 1925, Beebe set out on a second Galápagos expedition, The &quot;Arcturus&quot; Oceanographic Expedition, backed by Williams and several other donors. His ship for this expedition was the steam yacht &quot;Arcturus&quot;, presented to the New York Zoological Society by Executive Committee member Henry D. Whiton. &quot;Arcturus&quot;, at , was considerably larger than the &quot;Noma&quot; and was capable of being at sea for extended periods of time. The &quot;Arcturus&quot; was outfitted with Beebe&#x27;s pulpit and boom walk from the &quot;Noma&quot;, as well as cages and tanks for live animals, chemicals and vials to preserve dead ones, and a darkroom for developing film and studying the bioluminescent animals they hoped to encounter.

The &quot;Arcturus&quot; did not encounter the thick mats of sargassum in the Sargasso Sea that Beebe was hoping to study, but Beebe and his crew experienced great success dredging creatures from the sea off the coast of Saint Martin and Saba. In the Pacific, they encountered a strange boundary between two currents of very different temperatures, containing a vast diversity of life on the border between the two. He sailed along the border between the currents for several days to document it, theorizing that it could be the cause of the unusual climate which South America had recently been experiencing. Beebe&#x27;s study of these currents, and their effect on the climate of South America, is the earliest known study of the phenomenon known as El Niño.

Anchoring near Darwin Bay, Beebe made his first attempt at studying sea animals in their native environment by descending into the ocean in a diving helmet. Beebe continued to perform helmet dives throughout his Galápagos expedition, documenting several previously unknown sea animals. In addition to his helmet dives, Beebe applied the same method of research that he had pioneered in the tropics to a small area of ocean, sailing in circles around it for ten days to document all actions and interactions of marine life within that area. This study yielded a collection of 3,776 fish of 136 species, many of them also new to science.

While anchored off the Galápagos, Beebe and his crew noticed volcanic activity on Albemarle Island, and set out to investigate it. Anchoring in a small cove, Beebe and his assistant John Tee-Van searched for an active crater where they could observe the eruption and were nearing exhaustion by the time they found one. As he observed the crater, Beebe realized that the air surrounding it was filled with noxious gases, and narrowly avoided suffocation before staggering away from it. Observing the eruption from his ship for another two days, as well as again at a later point in the expedition, Beebe recorded how numerous birds and marine animals were killed after either failing to escape the lava or drawing too close to it in an attempt to scavenge other animals that had died.

During the return from the Galápagos through the Sargasso Sea, Beebe once again failed to find the thick mats of Sargassum whose study had been one of the primary goals of the expedition. Searching for a way to satisfy his expedition&#x27;s donors, Beebe hit upon the idea of documenting the marine life of the Hudson Gorge just beyond the shore of New York City. Applying the same techniques to studying the Hudson Gorge that he had used in the Galápagos, Beebe encountered a surprising variety of sea animals, many of which had previously been thought to be exclusive to the tropics.

Shortly after Beebe&#x27;s return from this expedition, Anthony Kuser requested that Beebe produce a condensed, popular version of his pheasant monograph. The book which resulted from this, titled &quot;Pheasants: Their Lives and Homes&quot; (also known by the title &quot;Pheasants of the World&quot;), was released in 1926 and received the John Burroughs Medal. During the course of writing this book, Beebe was reminded of many experiences during the pheasant expedition which he had not included in his original monograph, and wrote an additional book titled &quot;Pheasant Jungles&quot; about his adventures during this expedition. While &quot;A Monograph of the Pheasants&quot; had been a factual account of this expedition, &quot;Pheasant Jungles&quot; was a somewhat fictionalized account, in which Beebe altered some aspects of his experience to appeal to a wider audience.

===Haiti and Bermuda===
In 1927, Beebe went on an expedition to Haiti to document its marine life. Anchoring his ship the &quot;Lieutenant&quot; in the harbor of Port-au-Prince, he performed over 300 helmet dives examining the area&#x27;s coral reefs and classifying the fish that inhabited them. These dives involved several technological innovations: a watertight brass box which could be used to house a camera for underwater photography, and a telephone which was incorporated into the diving helmet, allowing the diver to dictate observations to someone on the surface instead of having to take notes underwater. Within a hundred days, Beebe and his team had created a catalog of species inhabiting the area nearly as long as what had been assembled on the neighboring island of Puerto Rico in the past four hundred years. In 1928 Beebe and Tee-Van published an illustrated and annotated list of 270 such species, which was expanded in 1935 bringing the total to 324. Beebe provided an account of this expedition in his 1928 book &quot;Beneath Tropic Seas&quot;, which was the first of his books to receive less than enthusiastic reviews, due to its episodic structure.

As he gained experience with helmet diving, Beebe soon became an enthusiastic advocate of it, believing it to be something that should be experienced by everyone who had the opportunity to do so. He later went so far as to suggest that beachfront homes would someday contain their own underwater gardens, to be experienced with the help of diving helmets:

By this point in his life Beebe was developing a close friendship with Helen Ricker, an American romance novelist who went by the pen name of Elswyth Thane, who had met Beebe in 1925. Very little of their early correspondence survives, but Elswyth had idolized Beebe for years, and her first novel &quot;Riders of the Wind&quot; was devoted to him. The novel was an account of a young woman who falls in love with and eventually marries, a much older adventurer who strongly resembled Beebe. Beebe and Elswyth were married on September 22, 1927, when Beebe was 50. Due to Elswyth&#x27;s tendency to misrepresent her age, conflicting accounts exist of how old she was when she and Beebe were married, ranging from 23 to 28. Elswyth and Beebe had an open marriage, in which neither expected sexual exclusivity from the other so long as their life together was not damaged.

Although &quot;Riders of the Wind&quot; was partially based on Beebe&#x27;s pheasant expedition, Elswyth did not enjoy Beebe&#x27;s current research. She disliked the heat of the tropics and was unwilling to go with Beebe to Kartabo. As a compromise, Beebe decided to continue his marine research in Bermuda, where she and Beebe had spent their honeymoon. Bermuda&#x27;s governor Louis Bols introduced Beebe to Prince George, who was fascinated by Beebe&#x27;s books, and Prince George persuaded Beebe to take him helmet diving. Governor Bols and Prince George subsequently offered Beebe Nonsuch Island, a island off the east coast of Bermuda, for use as a research station.

With the financial help of his sponsors, Beebe planned to use his new research station on Nonsuch Island to conduct a thorough study of an square area of ocean, documenting every living thing they could find from the surface to a depth of . However, Beebe&#x27;s ability to research the deep ocean using these methods was constrained by the inherent limitations of dredging, which could only provide an incomplete picture of the animals living there. Beebe compared the knowledge that could be gained of the deep ocean from dredging to what a visitor from Mars could learn about a fog-shrouded earthly city by using a dredge to pick up bits of debris from a street. Beebe began planning to create an underwater exploration device, which he could use to descend into the depths and observe these environments directly. The &quot;New York Times&quot; carried articles describing Beebe&#x27;s plans, which called for a diving bell with the shape of a cylinder.

These articles caught the attention of Otis Barton, an engineer who had long admired Beebe and who had his own ambition to become a deep-sea explorer. Barton was convinced that Beebe&#x27;s design for a diving vessel would never be capable of withstanding the extreme pressure of the deep ocean, and with the help of a friend who arranged a meeting with Beebe, proposed an alternative design to him. Barton&#x27;s design called for a spherical vessel, which was the strongest possible shape for resisting high pressure. Barton had the good fortune that years earlier, Theodore Roosevelt had proposed a similar idea to Beebe, and Beebe approved of Barton&#x27;s design. Beebe and Barton made a deal: Barton would pay for the sphere and all of the other equipment to go with it. In return, Beebe would pay for other expenses such as chartering a ship to raise and lower the sphere, and as the owner of the sphere, Barton would accompany Beebe on his expeditions in it. Beebe named their vessel the Bathysphere, from the Greek prefix &quot;bathy-&quot; meaning &quot;deep&quot; combined with &quot;sphere&quot;.

===Work at Nonsuch Island===
From 1930 to 1934, Beebe and Barton used the Bathysphere to conduct a series of dives of increasing depth off the coast of Nonsuch Island, becoming the first people to observe deep-sea animals in their native environment. The Bathysphere was lowered into the ocean using a steel cable, and a second cable carried a phone line which the Bathysphere&#x27;s occupants used to communicate with the surface, as well as an electrical cable for a searchlight to illuminate animals outside the Bathysphere. Beebe&#x27;s observations were relayed up the phone line to be recorded by Gloria Hollister, his chief technical associate who was also in charge of preparing specimens obtained from dredging. Beebe and Barton made a total of 35 dives in the Bathysphere, setting several consecutive world records for the deepest dive ever performed by a human. The record set by the deepest of these, to a depth of on August 15, 1934, lasted until it was broken by Barton in 1949.

In 1931, Beebe and Barton&#x27;s Bathysphere dives were interrupted for a year due to technical problems and uncooperative weather. An additional difficulty in 1931 was the death of Beebe&#x27;s father, and Beebe left Nonsuch Island for a week to attend his father&#x27;s funeral. A second year-long interruption occurred in 1933, and was caused in part by a lack of funds due to the Great Depression. Although Beebe and Barton performed no dives in 1933, their work gathered a large amount of publicity when the Bathysphere was displayed in a special exhibit for the American Museum of Natural History, and later at the Century of Progress World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago, where they shared the fair&#x27;s Hall of Science with Auguste Piccard. Beebe and Barton also obtained publicity for their dives from several articles Beebe wrote describing them for National Geographic, and from an NBC radio broadcast in which Beebe&#x27;s voice transmitted up the phone line from inside the Bathysphere was broadcast nationally over the radio.

Although Beebe attempted to ensure that Barton would receive credit as the Bathysphere&#x27;s inventor and Beebe&#x27;s fellow diver, the popular media tended to ignore Barton and pay attention only to Beebe. Barton was often resentful of this, believing Beebe to be deliberately hogging the fame. Beebe in turn lacked patience for Barton&#x27;s unpredictable moods and felt that Barton did not display the proper respect for the natural world. Still, Beebe and Barton both had something the other needed: Beebe for his experience as a marine biologist and Barton for his mechanical skill. Out of pragmatic concern for the success of their lives, they managed to resolve their disagreements well enough to work together at Nonsuch Island, although they did not remain on good terms afterward.

Likely, Beebe became romantically involved with Hollister during his work at Nonsuch Island. An entry in Beebe&#x27;s personal journal, written in a secret code that he used when describing things he wished kept secret, reads &quot;I kissed her [Gloria] and she loves me.&quot; It is unclear whether Elswyth knew of Beebe&#x27;s affair with Gloria, but if she did she appears to not have minded it. In addition to the open nature of their marriage, Elswyth described in a 1940s interview with &quot;Today&#x27;s Woman&quot; magazine that she enjoyed the knowledge that Beebe was attractive to women.

Beebe continued to conduct marine research after 1934, but he felt that he had seen what he wanted to see using the Bathysphere and that further drives were too expensive for whatever knowledge he gained from them to be worth the cost. With the help of Beebe&#x27;s friend the physician Henry Lloyd, Beebe conducted an expedition in the West Indies examining the stomach contents of tuna, which uncovered previously unknown larval forms of several species of fish. Shortly after returning, Beebe set out on a longer expedition to the waters around Baja California, financed by the Californian businessman Templeton Crocker on board his yacht the &quot;Zaca&quot;. The goal of this expedition was to study the area&#x27;s undersea fauna utilizing dredging and helmet diving, and Beebe and his team were surprised by the diversity of animals that they encountered there. In 1937 Beebe went on a second expedition aboard the &quot;Zaca&quot;, documenting the native wildlife along the Pacific Coast from Mexico to Colombia. During this expedition, rather than focusing on either sea animals as he had at Nonsuch Island or on birds as he had earlier in his life, he attempted to document all aspects of the ecosystem. Beebe described his two expeditions onboard the &quot;Zaca&quot; in his books &quot;Zaca Venture&quot; and &quot;The Book of Bays&quot;, in which he emphasized his concern for threatened habitats and his dismay at human destruction.

During the two &quot;Zaca&quot; expeditions Beebe was accompanied by his longtime assistant John Tee-Van as well as Jocelyn Crane, a young carcinologist who had first worked for Beebe at Nonsuch Island in 1932, and who would subsequently be among Beebe&#x27;s most cherished associates for the rest of his life. Like Hollister before her, Crane would eventually become Beebe&#x27;s lover during the long expeditions that Beebe made without Elswyth&#x27;s companionship. During this time Beebe was also forming a close friendship with Winnie-the-Pooh&#x27;s creator A. A. Milne, who wrote of &quot;Half Mile Down&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t know which I envy you most: all those moral and physical qualities which you have and I lack, or all that wonder of a new world. [...] One of the few things in the world of which I am really proud is that I know Will Beebe.&quot;

===Return to the tropics===
Although Beebe continued to use Nonsuch Island as his base of operations throughout the 1930s, with the onset of World War II in 1939 it was announced that the ferry linking Bermuda to New York would soon be making its final run, requiring Beebe and his team to hastily abandon their station there. Transportation to and from Bermuda resumed in 1940, and Beebe returned there in May 1941, but the environment was slowly being transformed due to the war. A large number of military ships made docking difficult, most of the island&#x27;s reefs were being destroyed to construct an airfield, and the combination of construction activity and pollution made observing the sea life impossible. Appalled by the destruction, Beebe finally rented his station at Nonsuch Island to a military contractor and returned to New York.

With the loss of their station in Bermuda, Beebe and Elswyth gave up on their compromise of finding a research station where they could both be happy. Elswyth, who was most content in temperate environments, began searching for a home in New England where she could continue her writing. Meanwhile, Beebe began searching for a new tropical research station to replace Kartabo, which had fallen victim to deforestation just like Kalacoon before it. Beebe eventually helped Elswyth purchase a small farm near Wilmington, Vermont, where he visited her frequently. Elswyth explained in a magazine interview that she was uncomfortable on Beebe&#x27;s expeditions, so the two of them had agreed that they would keep their careers separate from their private lives.

With the financial assistance of Standard Oil and the Guggenheim Foundation, Beebe established his next research station in Caripito, a small city in Venezuela around west of Trinidad and Tobago. Beebe and his team used this station to study the ecology of the region and recorded how its inhabitants were affected by its cycle of wet and dry seasons. One important study which resulted from this region was the first documentation of rhinoceros beetles using their horns in competition between males, proving that their horns were an adaptation for sexual selection rather than for defense against predators. Although Beebe&#x27;s research at Caripito was productive, he felt that the extremity of its wet-dry cycle made it impractical as a research station, and the expanding oil operations in the region were in danger of destroying the local environment. For these reasons, Beebe did not return to Caripito after his first season there.

In the spring of 1944, Jocelyn Crane returned to Venezuela to search for a location for a new field station to replace the one at Caripito. The location that she found, known as Rancho Grande, had initially been intended as a palace for Venezuela&#x27;s dictator Juan Vicente Gómez in the Henri Pittier National Park. The palace&#x27;s construction had been left unfinished after Gómez&#x27;s death, and since then the building&#x27;s vast corridors and ballrooms had become the home of jaguars, tapirs and sloths. Unlike Beebe&#x27;s other tropical research stations, which had been located in lowland regions, Rancho Grande was located on a mountainside in what Beebe described as &quot;the ultimate cloud jungle&quot;. Creole Petroleum, a Venezuelan spin-off of Standard, agreed to cover the cost of the station and finished a small portion of the vast structure for Beebe and his team to use. Beebe and his team began work there in 1945, staying as guests of the Venezuelan government.

Rancho Grande was located at a mountain pass in a branch of the Andes known as the Venezuelan Coastal Range, which was an important migration route for butterflies, and the station proved very lucrative in the study of insects. During his work at Rancho Grande, Beebe broke his leg in a fall from a ladder, and the forced immobility which resulted from having his leg in a cast presented him with a new opportunity for observing the area&#x27;s wildlife. At his request, he and his chair were transported into the nearby jungle, and as he sat motionless the wild animals around him soon began to go about their business without noticing his presence. His immobility also presented him with the opportunity to spend hours at a time observing a pair of bat falcons through binoculars, documenting the behavior of their two chicks and every prey item fed to them by their parents. His observations documented several behaviors which were new to science, including the first documented example of play in birds.

Although Beebe and his team enjoyed rewarding seasons at Rancho Grande in 1945 and 1946, they did not return there in 1947. The reason they gave in their annual report was that the previous two seasons had produced so much material that they needed an additional year to analyze it, but in reality, this was more the result of insufficient funding as well as the unstable state of Venezuelan politics. Beebe returned to Rancho Grande in 1948, where he completed several technical papers about the migration patterns of birds and insects, as well as a comprehensive study of the area&#x27;s ecology which he coauthored with Jocelyn Crane. Realizing that the area&#x27;s politics might soon put an end to their research there, in spring of 1948 Jocelyn made a side trip to Trinidad and Tobago in hope of finding a site for a research station where the politics would be more secure. Finally, when the 1948 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état installed Marcos Pérez Jiménez as Venezuela&#x27;s dictator, Beebe decided that he could no longer continue to work in Venezuela. Beebe described his experiences at Rancho Grande in his 1949 book &quot;High Jungle&quot;, which was the last of Beebe&#x27;s major books.

In January 1950, the New York Zoological Society celebrated to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Beebe&#x27;s work for them. He was by this point the only remaining member of the zoo&#x27;s original staff, and had produced more scholarly papers and publicity than any other employee. Letters and testimonials poured in from other scientists with whom Beebe had worked, attesting to their admiration of him and his influence on them. One letter from the Harvard biologist Ernst Mayr wrote that Beebe&#x27;s work had been an inspiration to his own, particularly &quot;A Monograph of the Pheasants&quot; and Beebe&#x27;s books about jungle wildlife.

===Final years in Trinidad and Tobago===
The product of Jocelyn Crane&#x27;s search for a potential research station in Trinidad and Tobago was a house on a hill overlooking the Arima Valley, which was known as Verdant Vale. In 1949, Beebe bought this estate to use a permanent research station to replace Rancho Grande. Beebe renamed the estate Simla, after the hill in India that featured in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s writings. He later described the sense of destiny that marked his introduction to the estate:

At Simla Beebe and his team worked closely together with Asa and Newcome Wright, the owners of the adjacent Spring Hill estate, who provided accommodations for them while water and electricity were connected at Simla. Although the initial purchase of Simla had contained only the house and of the forest surrounding it, Beebe soon realized that this was insufficient for the research he wished to conduct, and purchased another neighboring estate known as St. Pat&#x27;s which contained an additional . In 1953, Beebe donated both properties to the New York Zoological Society for one dollar, giving him the position of one of the society&#x27;s &quot;Benefactors in Perpetuity&quot;.

Research at Simla formally began in 1950. Beebe&#x27;s research at Simla combined elements of many different earlier stages of his research, including observations of the life cycles of the area&#x27;s birds, detailed analyses of every plant and animal in small areas of forest, and studies of insect behavior. Insects were the focus of the scientific papers he produced during this period, marking a transition from his past areas of study into the field of entomology. Local children periodically brought animal specimens to Beebe at Simla and asked him to classify them. Remembering the early studies of his own childhood, in which he had brought specimens to the American Museum of Natural History, he was happily working with them.

 In 1952, on his seventy-fifth birthday, Beebe retired from his position as the director of the NYZS&#x27;s Department of Zoological Society and became Director Emeritus, while Jocelyn Crane was promoted to Assistant Director. In honor of his lifetime of work as a naturalist, Beebe was awarded the Theodore Roosevelt Distinguished Service Medal in 1953. Beebe&#x27;s last major expedition occurred in 1955, retracing the route he had taken during his pheasant expedition 45 years earlier, with the intention of discovering how the populations he had previously studied were faring in response to human encroachment. Jocelyn accompanied him on this expedition for the purpose of documenting Asia&#x27;s fiddler crabs. Although Jocelyn&#x27;s studies during this expedition served as part of the basis for her monograph &quot;Fiddler Crabs of the World&quot;, Beebe never published the results of his own observations during it.

During Beebe&#x27;s later years, Simla was an important gathering point for researchers in many other areas of biology. Other biologists who visited to conduct studies there and exchange ideas with Beebe included myrmecologist Ted Schneirla, ethologist Konrad Lorenz, entomologist Lincoln Brower, ethologist Donald Griffin, and ornithologist David Snow. Snow became a regular visitor to Simla, and in return Beebe provided financial assistance for some of Snow&#x27;s own research. Beebe devised an unusual method for determining how he would react to his visitors at Simla. His terrace there was decorated with statues of characters from Winnie-the-Pooh that had been a gift from A. A. Milne. Visitors who recognized these characters as Milne&#x27;s creations were greeted by Beebe with enthusiasm, while those who did not recognize them were just endured by Beebe until they left.

Beebe remained active well into his old age. In 1957, at the age of eighty, he was still capable of climbing slippery tree trunks to study bird nests. However, by 1959 his strength had lessened enough that long hikes and tree climbing were no longer practical for him, and he contented himself with work that could be conducted in the laboratory, such as dissecting birds&#x27; nests to analyze their method of construction. Beebe also began to be afflicted with a throat ailment which may have been Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, although lacking a complete understanding of what caused it, Beebe and his doctors referred to it as &quot;mango mouth&quot;. Beebe was reluctant to accept speaking engagements because of the effect this had on his voice, although he continued to give lectures on occasion with Jocelyn&#x27;s help.

In an account of his final meeting with Beebe, Henry Fairfield Osborn, Jr. describes how during Beebe&#x27;s last few years he gradually succumbed to illness, eventually becoming nearly immobile and incapable of speech. However, Beebe&#x27;s personal physician A. E. Hill provides a differing account, stating that Beebe remained lucid and able to move about without assistance almost until his last day, apart from the periods of time during which his &quot;mango mouth&quot; temporarily slurred his speech. Both accounts agree that throughout his final years Beebe remained fond of playing practical jokes on his visitors at Simla, and retained his sense of humor even within days of his death.

William Beebe died of pneumonia at Simla on June 4, 1962. According to his wishes, he was buried in Mucurapo Cemetery in Port of Spain. Memorial services were held in both Trinidad and Tobago and New York City so that Beebe&#x27;s friends in both parts of the world could attend. Following Beebe&#x27;s death, Jocelyn succeeded him as the director of the Department of Tropical Research and continued to run the Simla station along with the rest of Beebe&#x27;s former staff.

Beebe had frequently worried that Elswyth would write a biography of him after his death. To prevent this possibility, he left all of his papers and journals to Jocelyn. After Elswyth died in 1984, Jocelyn donated Beebe&#x27;s papers to the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections at Princeton University&#x27;s Firestone Library. Even in the possession of Firestone Library, Beebe&#x27;s papers remained inaccessible without Jocelyn&#x27;s permission, and most scholars were prevented from using them until Jocelyn offered access to the writer, Carol Grant Gould, to write Beebe&#x27;s biography. The Archives of the Wildlife Conservation Society also holds several collections related to the Department of Tropical Research.

==Personality and cultural image==
William Beebe was more famous in the United States than any other American naturalist before the days of television. As a scientific writer who participated in both the popular and academic worlds, he occupied a similar role to the role later occupied by Stephen Jay Gould. Beebe was a well-known figure in the Roaring Twenties of New York City and was friends with numerous other well-known figures of the period, including Fannie Hurst and the cartoonist Rube Goldberg. Although he was not physically handsome in the traditional sense, he tended to dominate every social and professional situation due to his enthusiasm, intelligence, and charisma. As a result of his much-publicized divorce from Blair and his later marriage to Elswyth, he was also known for his stormy relationships with women.

Beebe described his religious beliefs as a combination of Presbyterianism and Buddhism. His religion was largely the result of seeking to combine his sense of awe and wonder at the natural world with a scientific understanding of its workings. He was highly critical of efforts to use science to justify political ideologies, such as socialism or the belief that women were inferior to men. Beebe also disapproved of the eugenic ideas advocated by many biologists in the early 20th century, including some of his contemporaries at the zoo, although this was largely out of fear that these ideas would alienate friends of the zoo and cause divisions among its staff.

Beebe had a troubled relationship with some of his superiors at the zoo, particularly Hornaday, who was resentful of Beebe&#x27;s constant demands for more funding and staff, as well as the fact that as Beebe&#x27;s career progressed he gradually devoted less and less time to care for the zoo itself. One particular point of disagreement was Beebe&#x27;s forgetfulness about returning books which he had borrowed from the Zoological Society&#x27;s Library, which would occasionally go missing for years as a result. However, Hornaday never publicly expressed his disagreements with Beebe and did not hesitate to defend Beebe&#x27;s work when others criticized it.

Beebe had high expectations of the people working under him on all of his expeditions, although he never revealed the exact characteristics that he looked for in potential employees. Henry Fairfield Osborn Jr. recounts one incident in which Beebe turned down a scientist who wished to work with him when the scientist described boredom with his current duties as one of his reasons for requesting this. In response to this request, Beebe retorted:

Beebe nonetheless exhibited a high degree of loyalty to those employees who were capable of meeting his standards. When he felt that the pressure of working under him had become too great, he would announce that his birthday was approaching, and his staff would have several days free from work to celebrate it. On one such occasion, when a scientist working under Beebe whispered to him that he knew it was not in fact Beebe&#x27;s birthday, Beebe responded &quot;A man should have a birthday when he needs one&quot;.

==Impact of work and legacy==
William Beebe was a pioneer in the field now known as ecology. His theory that organisms must be understood in the context of the ecosystems they inhabit was completely new for its time and has been highly influential. The method he invented of methodically analyzing all organisms within a small area of wilderness has become a standard method in this field. Beebe was also a pioneer in the field of oceanography, setting a precedent with his Bathysphere dives which many other researchers would follow.

E. O. Wilson, Sylvia Earle and Ernst Mayr have all described Beebe&#x27;s work as an influence on their own choice of careers. Among the most significant of Beebe&#x27;s influences on other researchers was Rachel Carson, who regarded Beebe as both a friend and an inspiration. Carson dedicated her 1951 book &quot;The Sea Around Us&quot; to Beebe, writing &quot;My absorption in the mystery and meaning of the sea have been stimulated and the writing of this book aided by the friendship and encouragement of William Beebe.&quot; Due to Beebe&#x27;s renewed emphasis on field research at a time when laboratory studies were becoming the dominant trend in biology, more recent field researchers such as Jane Goodall and George Schaller are also sometimes considered his intellectual descendants.

By writing for a scientific as well as the popular audience, Beebe did much to make science accessible to the general public. This was particularly significant in the area of conservation, of which he was one of the most important early advocates. With his many writings about the dangers of environmental destruction, Beebe helped to raise public awareness about this topic. However, Beebe&#x27;s prolific writing for a popular audience had a downside, in that other scientists of his time were reluctant to hold him in high accord because they regarded him as a popularizer.

During the course of his career, Beebe authored over 800 articles and 21 books, including his four-volume pheasant monograph. He had a total of 64 animals named after him, and he described one new species of bird and 87 species of fish (see :Category:Taxa named by William Beebe). While 83 of the fish that he described were done so in a conventional manner, the remaining four were done so based on visual observations.

A lingering controversy exists in ichthyology over the validity of the four species Beebe described based on visual descriptions only, which he had observed during his Bathysphere dives. The naming of a new species ordinarily requires obtaining and analyzing a type specimen, something which was obviously impossible from inside the Bathysphere. Some of Beebe&#x27;s critics claimed that these fish were illusions resulting from condensation on the Bathysphere&#x27;s window, or even that Beebe willfully made them up, although the latter would have been strongly at odds with Beebe&#x27;s reputation as an honest and rigorous scientist. While many of Beebe&#x27;s observations from the Bathysphere have since been confirmed by advances in undersea photography, it is unclear whether others fit the description of any known sea animal. One possibility is that although these animals indeed exist, so much remains to be discovered about life in the deep ocean that these animals have yet to be seen by anyone other than him.

In addition to his descriptions of new taxa, the crab &quot;Leptuca beebei&quot; , commonly known as Beebe&#x27;s fiddler crab, was named in his honor.

===Tetrapteryx===

Along with his analysis of pheasant phylogeny and his studies of life in the Galápagos Islands, Beebe regarded one of his most important contributions to the field of evolutionary biology to be his hypothesis that the ancestors of birds passed through what he referred to as a “Tetrapteryx stage”, with wings on both their front and hind limbs. Beebe based this theory on his observation that the hatchlings and embryos of some modern birds possess long quill feathers on their legs, which he regarded as an atavism; he also noticed vestiges of leg-wings on one of the specimens of &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;. Beebe described his idea in a 1915 paper published in &quot;Zoologica&quot;, titled &quot;A Tetrapteryx Stage in the Ancestry of Birds&quot;.

Gerhard Heilmann discussed Beebe&#x27;s Tetrapteryx hypothesis at considerable length in his 1926 book &quot;The Origin of Birds&quot;. Heilmann examined hatchlings of many other bird species, both closely related to those studied by Beebe and belonging to more primitive species, in hope of finding additional evidence for the leg-wings which Beebe had documented. After failing to find such evidence, Heilmann ultimately rejected Beebe&#x27;s Tetrapteryx hypothesis, and this remained the consensus among ornithologists for the next several decades. Beebe, however, continued to advance his Tetrapteryx hypothesis as late as the 1940s.

In 2003, Beebe&#x27;s Tetrapteryx hypothesis was supported by the discovery of &quot;Microraptor gui&quot;, a small feathered dinosaur which possessed asymmetrical flight feathers on both its front and hind limbs. Beebe&#x27;s Tetrapteryx hypothesis is now regarded as prescient for its prediction of both the anatomy and likely gliding posture of &quot;Microraptor gui&quot;, which Richard O. Prum has described as &quot;[looking] as if it could have glided straight out of the pages of Beebe’s notebooks.&quot; This animal&#x27;s discovery has had the effect of resurrecting Beebe&#x27;s theory that leg feathers played an important role in the origin of bird flight.

===William Beebe Tropical Research Station===
Following William Beebe&#x27;s death in 1962, his research station at Simla remained in operation under Jocelyn Crane&#x27;s management, under the new name of the William Beebe Tropical Research Station. However, because Jocelyn&#x27;s research required her to travel north for extended periods, by 1965 she had little time to keep the station running. By 1971, the station had fallen into disuse and was declared closed. Meanwhile, as Asa Wright&#x27;s health began to fail in her old age, her friends began to fear that after her death her neighboring estate of Spring Hill might be lost to developers and established a trust to buy the estate and convert it into the Asa Wright nature center. In 1974, Beebe&#x27;s property was donated to the newly established Asa Wright Nature Center.

Now under the management of the Asa Wright Nature Center, the William Beebe Tropical Research Station has gradually been renovated. It is now once again actively involved in research and an important gathering place for scientists. It is also a popular destination for birdwatchers, who can observe the same populations of hummingbirds, tanagers and oilbirds that William Beebe studied decades earlier.

<doc id="205789" wikidata="Q1084421" url="?curid=205789" title="Mandatory Swedish">
<text>Swedish is a mandatory school subject in Finland for Finnish-speaking pupils in the last four years of primary education (grades from 6 to 9), although only about 5 % from citizens of Finland are Swedish-speaking, this minority is still shrinking, many of Swedish speaking in Finland are practically bilingual and in other parts of the world this language is spoken almost only in the neighbour state Sweden. In elementary school, there are two Swedish lessons a week, and by the fall of 2024, the number will increase to three. The linguistically nationalist Swedish People&#x27;s Party in Finland would like to increase the number of compulsory Swedish lessons by more than 50%, make Swedish compulsory again in matriculation essays and remove the obligation for Swedish-speaking civil servants to know how to speak Finnish properly. The party also demands that Finnish taxpayers&#x27; money be used to pay for a campaign in Sweden, Norway and Denmark to attract people to study in Swedish-speaking educational institutions in Finland.
This &quot;other domestic language&quot; is also mandatory in the all high schools (&quot;lukio&quot;, &quot;gymnasium&quot;), vocational schools (&quot;ammattikoulu&quot;, &quot;yrkesskola&quot;), business schools (&quot;kauppaoppilaitos&quot;, &quot;handelskola&quot;), police school, theater school, folk colleges and universities and the other tertiary education instituties for students of all fields. In Finland, the study of Swedish has always been compulsory in high school (however, no longer since 2004 in the matriculation records), in the 1970s it became compulsory in primary school at the request of the Swedish People&#x27;s Party (RKP, SFP) and Johannes Virolainen and by 2010, at the request of the said party, the requirement was extended to almost all other educational institutions in Finland. The Swedish-Speaking president Alexander Stubb wants, that already from the first grade of primary school (from 2016 it is compulsory to start from the sixth grade, previously it started from the seventh). He has also said that he and his wife do not speak Finnish but only Swedish and English to their children. Swedish is also partly mandatory in the army. Anna-Maja Henriksson, a patriotic Finnish-Swedish politician specializing in language policy, former chairwoman of the Swedish People&#x27;s Party, has also demanded that Swedish should be compulsory already in preschool (&quot;esikoulu&quot;/&quot;förskolan&quot;), which is mandatory from 2015. It has not come true, but the demands of the Swedish People&#x27;s Party of Finland have become even tougher: now the party demands that Swedish be taught as compulsory already in kindergarten. This is one of the election themes of the Swedish People&#x27;s Party in the municipal elections held in autumn 2025.

Furthermore, all university graduates must demonstrate a certain level of proficiency in Swedish (the so-called &quot;public servant&#x27;s Swedish&quot;). Altogether, 89% of Finnish citizens are native Finnish speakers, whereas 5.3% of the population report Swedish as their mother tongue. It is currently possible for Finnish citizens to report a different mother tongue for themselves as many times as desired by submitting a form to the Population Register Center.

According to the Finnish constitution, both Finnish and Swedish are national languages. The employees of the national government and the bilingual municipal governments are required to be capable of serving citizens in Swedish. The official term for both mandatory Swedish and Finnish is &quot;the other domestic language&quot;. The requirement to study Swedish is often referred to as &quot;pakkoruotsi&quot;, a term in Finnish meaning &quot;mandatory Swedish&quot;, or &quot;forced Swedish,&quot; and similarly, Finnish as a mandatory school subject for native Swedish speakers in Finland is sometimes referred to as &quot;mandatory Finnish&quot; or &quot;enforced Finnish&quot; (&quot;tvångsfinska&quot;, &quot;pakkosuomi&quot;), but since Swedish speakers in Finland are nowadays only a small minority (5%) (earlier maybe 20 %) and many, maybe half of the young people, are practically bilingual, the term &quot;mandatory Finnish&quot; is not as widely used. It is not a similar phenomenon, although governed by the same laws In practice, learning Finnish in Swedish-speaking educational institutions in Finland is considerably more extensive than learning Swedish in Finnish-speaking educational institutions. According to Kari Sajavaara (1938–2006), a Finnish applied linguistics researcher and professor at the University of Jyväskylä who is familiar with the subject, the meaning of the Finnish language for Swedish speakers in Finland is quite different from the meaning of the Swedish language for Finnish speakers.

== Overview ==
The status of Swedish as a national language in Finland is defined by the Finnish constitution. During the Middle Ages, Swedish-speaking peasants migrated to some Finnish coastal areas. Finland was ruled by Sweden at this time, and the Swedish language became part of the culture in those coastal areas, as well as the language of the ruling classes. The Finnish language was denied official status until the period of Russian rule (1809–1917) began in 1860. 

In Mainland Finland, both Finnish and Swedish are mandatory subjects in primary and secondary schools. The Swedish Matriculation Examination was made voluntary in 2004, although all university graduates must demonstrate that their skills in the other official language meet the standard required of all academically educated public servants. This means the completion of a so-called &quot;public servant&#x27;s Swedish&quot; &quot;test&quot;. The autonomous territory Åland (pop. 26,000, 95% Swedish, 5% Finnish) have only one official language, Swedish, and the speaking of Finnish between employees is forbidden in some public services. Protection of the Swedish language is one of the main agendas of the Swedish People&#x27;s Party, which has been a minor partner in most cabinets since Finland&#x27;s independence, and in all cabinets between 1972 and 2015 and from 2019.

== History ==
The area that today is Finland was an integral part of Sweden proper from the Middle Ages to the end of the Finnish War in 1809. Swedish migrants settled in coastal areas, and the language of administration was Swedish. This prompted many Finnish-speakers to learn Swedish in hopes of improving their social status, with some finn-speaking specially in Uusimaa switching to Swedish altogether.

Following the Finnish War, Sweden ceded Finland to Russia, and the Russian tsar established the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland. Although a Governor-General was installed by the Russians as the highest authority within the Grand Duchy, much of the political system remained the same: Finland was allowed to keep its ”laws, religion and language” from the Swedish time. The tsar wanted to avoid trouble in the new territory, and also used former Swedish upper class to further modernization in Russia; Finnish could not be used as an official language at this time because the administration did not know Finnish well enough and the language was undeveloped regarding such use.

When Finland became autonomous, there was a big interest in the mostly Swedish speaking upper class in creating a new national identity and exploring the Finnish language and Finnish culture. At some point, the Fennoman movement arose, arguing that the country should be a united nation, with only one language. As a reaction, the Svecoman movement began and grew in strength, representing fears that abandoning Swedish would lead to slavicisation or worse.

However, during the 1860s, under Tsar Alexander II, legal equality between Finnish and Swedish as languages of administration gradually began to be introduced. Thus, since the late 19th century, Finnish has been a co-official language of administration in Finland. Modernizations typical for the era were introduced, boosting the status of the Finnish-speaking majority: the special rights of the higher estates of the realm were abolished, and a modern parliament based on universal suffrage was introduced 1907. Eventually, in 1917, Finland became independent.

The current form of mandatory Swedish was implemented as a part of the modernization of the educational system in the 1970s. Previously, a Swedish test had been compulsory on university level and in &quot;oppikoulu&quot;, a secondary school that was a prerequisite to matriculation to a university, but not in the common &quot;kansakoulu&quot;. The introduction of the &quot;peruskoulu&quot; (student ages 7–15), compulsory for all children, introduced a course in Swedish compulsory to all pupils, while Swedish courses and standardized tests at higher levels remained mandatory. This was primarily motivated by the possibility that any student could become a public official, and would thus be required to know Swedish.

== Current situation ==

A compulsory introductory course to Swedish for all pupils in primary education was introduced in 1972–1977 as a part of modernization of the primary education system, at the same time the nine-year school (&quot;peruskoulu, grundskola&quot;) was made universally compulsory. Until then, there had been mandatory courses only in secondary and tertiary education. Since the end of the 19th century, administrative services have been offered in both domestic languages; therefore, employees are proficient in both Finnish and Swedish. The reform was based on a political ambition to strengthen ties with the Western world through Scandinavia, and to show that Finland was a part of the Nordic countries, not an Eastern Bloc country. It also sought to improve social mobility by ensuring that a decision on language in the early school years would not become an obstacle for applicants to the civil service.

In the upper secondary general school all students learn at least two languages besides their mother tongue, one of which is the other domestic language, except for people studying some other language as their mother tongue (e.g. immigrants and those studying Sami). Finnish speakers take Swedish, and vice versa. According to Statistics Finland, practically all the students take English, either as a compulsory or an optional language. There is also a possibility to take one or more extra foreign languages. Despite Finland being a neighbour of Russia, Russian is not taught in most schools of Finland, and only 1.5% of Finns know some Russian. Due to relatively little cultural exchange between the Finns and Russians in the 20th century and Finland&#x27;s hostile relations with the Soviet Union following the Finnish Civil War (1918) until World War II (1939–1944), tensions persist between Finland and Russia.

The arrangement of &quot;mandatory Swedish and practically-mandatory English&quot; has been criticized as reducing the diversity of the language skills of the population. The EU target is to teach two foreign languages; as English is an overwhelmingly popular choice, it has been suggested by, for example, the Confederation of Finnish Industries that keeping Swedish compulsory directly prevents choosing other languages.

== Surveys ==

A number of studies into opinions regarding mandatory Swedish have been made with various results. The large differences between studies exemplifies the problems in conducting a neutral and broad study without asking leading questions on the subject. Furthermore, some of the studies have been commissioned by organizations that have politically partisan views on the subject of mandatory Swedish.

Between 1990 and 2003, Taloustutkimus Oy conducted more than ten surveys for Suomalaisuuden liitto, an organization opposing mandatory Swedish. According to these surveys, 66–72% of Finns were &quot;in favor of voluntary Swedish education or against mandatory Swedish education&quot;.

Suomen Gallup&#x27;s 2003 survey concluded that while a small majority supported &quot;compulsory second domestic language studying&quot;, it was opposed by 42% of Finns, and 25% did not want both Finnish and Swedish to be official languages of Finland. This study was commissioned by Yle, the Finnish publicly funded national broadcasting company. The question posed to those surveyed was very verbose in comparison to the Taloustutkimus surveys on the same subject. The question did not include the word &quot;Swedish&quot;.

In 1992, a study by &quot;Valitut Palat&quot; (the Finnish edition of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;) concluded that 90 percent of parents of third to fourth grade pupils &quot;supported a reduction of compulsory languages&quot; (only Finnish and Swedish are compulsory). When &quot;Valitut Palat&quot; did a new survey in 2003 it found 64% opposed mandatory Swedish, and 25% did not desire two official languages.

An IEA study (2000) revealed that 67% of young people studying in Finnish-speaking schools wanted to make Swedish a voluntary subject. The most politically aware youths were the most critical against Swedishness in this study.

A study conducted in 1997 by Folktinget, an official consultative organization representing Finland&#x27;s Swedish-speakers, concluded that 70% of the Finnish-speaking population considered &quot;Swedish a vital and important part of Finnish society.&quot; This study also indicated that the most negative opinions about mandatory Swedish were found among those with academic degrees.

A study conducted by Taloustutkimus for Yle in 2013 indicated that 63 percent of respondents were opposed to mandatory Swedish. Further, the study indicated that among the supporters of the different political parties, only supporters of the Swedish People&#x27;s Party and the Green League favoured retaining mandatory Swedish teaching. A majority of supporters in all other parties wanted Swedish teaching to be voluntary – the supporters of the Finns Party and the Social Democrats were most heavily in favor of making Swedish voluntary (76 and 73 percent respectively).

A study conducted by Åbo Akademi in 2014 indicated that 74 percent of Finnish speaking respondents agreed with the statement &quot;The teaching of the Swedish language should be voluntary&quot;.

==Opinions==

In many cases, pupils have negative expectations and experiences of learning Swedish, which may foster a negative attitude towards the Swedish language and culture. This behavior is claimed to hark back to a time when Finland was a part of Sweden (see Finland under Swedish rule), and Swedish was the language of prestige while Finnish was looked down on by the government. 
Negative opinions towards studying Swedish are also grounded in the fact that mandatory Swedish is taught throughout the country, even though there are very few Swedish-speakers in mainland Finland outside the coastal area by the Baltic Sea. This fact can make the policy of bilingualism seem artificial, but the basic curriculum remains the same for the entire country.

Supporters of Mandatory Swedish argue that the policy brings Finland closer to the Nordic countries, since Swedish is part of the larger Scandinavian dialect continuum and mutually intelligible with both Danish and Norwegian. On the contrary, Finnish belongs to the unrelated Finnic language group. The Scandinavian languages have over 25 million speakers in the Nordic region and are the largest languages by far. They are also the working languages of the Nordic political bodies (the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers), and are spoken in all the Nordic countries as majority, official or second languages. Due to this, proponents of mandatory Swedish regard Finnish citizens&#x27; knowledge of Swedish is as essential for Finland&#x27;s ability to be included in Nordic cooperation and maintain its Nordic identity. Supporters argue that knowledge of Swedish gives Finnish citizens access to the culture and labour market of Scandinavia, a region four times the size of Finland. They also believe that it gives Finnish citizens access to Finland&#x27;s own history, as for 500 years, Swedish was Finland&#x27;s sole language of prestige and government, used as the medium of administration, the judiciary and higher education. Lastly, they argue mandatory Swedish is necessary to ensure that Swedish-speakers can interact with governmental institutions and get service, such as health care, in their own mother tongue.

According to a study published in 2002, students are interested in the Swedish language, and find it an important part of education, but they perceived the compulsory nature of Swedish language education lessened their motivation (this argument has been made very frequently in the public debate). The experiment of making the Swedish test voluntary in the matriculation examination (the completion of which is a &quot;de facto&quot; requirement for university enrollment) was declared successful and has been made permanent. The percentage of students taking the Swedish test has since been constantly dropping and was 67% in 2009 (less than 50% of boys).

There has also been a lot of criticism of the methodology used to teach Swedish and the lack of competence in many of the teachers. This has contributed to students&#x27; lack of motivation to study Swedish, and many may not learn to speak the language beyond a very basic level. Some students argue that they will never need Swedish, as its utility in the Finnish job market is limited to a few fields. Moreover, the rationale of mandatory tuition in Swedish and other subjects is to give the students a more general knowledge base, and not to train them for a specific field.

In addition to the direct costs of the tuition, some argue that mandatory Swedish effectively replaces elective courses in languages such as French, German and Russian, which these persons argue are more important than Swedish in a globalized world. University students are required to not only master their selected field, but also to study at least two languages beside their mother tongue, one of which is obligatorily Swedish for Finnish-speakers. As study material is often in English, this effectively removes the free choice; the two &quot;voluntarily chosen&quot; languages must be Swedish and English. Additionally, very few Finns speak Estonian (which is not taught in most schools), a language of the same Finnic language group as Finnish, and national language of Finland&#x27;s southern neighbor Estonia (although Finnish is popular in Estonia).

Sentiments toward mandatory Swedish vary. Many prominent politicians (both Finnish- and Swedish-speaking) wholeheartedly support mandatory Swedish in schools, while others oppose it. There have been numerous petitions and other similar campaigns arranged by some small but dedicated organizations to pressure lawmakers into abolishing mandatory Swedish; however, to date, they have had no significant impact on the established policy. Thus, while the ongoing debate is often heated and passionate, the support for mandatory Swedish tuition remains strong enough among politicians for the government not to consider a change of policy.

Mandatory Swedish is supported by most political parties in Finland, like the National Coalition Party, the Centre Party, the Social Democrats and the Left Alliance. The Finns Party opposes mandatory Swedish, and so does the youth wing of the National Coalition Party.

In 2013, the Confederation of Finnish Industries came out in favor of making Swedish teaching voluntary. They referred to a study which indicated that, in the future, Swedish will only be the tenth most important language to Finnish companies. According to Hufvudstadsbladet, the Confederation has subsequently changed their stance and no longer favors making Swedish voluntary, while maintaining the need for learning other languages.

===In the Finnish Parliament===
In the 2000s, the government dropped the requirement to take Swedish (or Finnish in the case of the Swedish-speaking minority) as part of the high school matriculation examination.

In 2014, a citizens&#x27; initiative demanding an end to mandatory Swedish teaching on all levels of education was brought to the Finnish Parliament. In 2015, the MPs voted (134 to 48) to keep mandatory Swedish. In another vote, the MPs voted (93 to 89) to demand that the government should examine whether a regional experimentation—where another language would be taught instead of Swedish—is possible.

<text>The Boven Merwede (; &quot;Upper Merwede&quot;) is a stretch of river in the Netherlands, mainly fed by the river Rhine. The Afgedamde Maas river joins the Waal at Woudrichem to form the Boven Merwede, which at Hardinxveld-Giessendam splits into the Beneden Merwede river on the right and the Nieuwe Merwede river on the left. Its length is . The Merwede is part of the main shipping route between Rotterdam and Germany.

A road bridge connects the west side of Gorinchem on the north to the west side of Sleeuwijk on the south.

There are several passenger ferries.

<text>The Afgedamde Maas (; Dammed-up Meuse) is a former distributary of the Maas River (French: Meuse) in the Dutch provinces of North Brabant and Gelderland. The Maas splits near Heusden with one channel flowing north until its confluence with the river Waal (the main distributary of the river Rhine) to form the Merwede, while the other channel (the Bergse Maas) continues west as the main distributary of the Maas.

==History==
The current Afgedamde Maas was created in the late Middle Ages, when a major flood made a connection between the Maas and the Merwede at the town of Woudrichem. From that moment on, the current Afgedamde Maas was the main branch of the river Maas. The former main branch eventually silted up and is today called the Oude Maasje. With the completion of the Wilhelminasluis (nl) in 1896, the connection between the Maas and Rhine was closed. The resulting separation of the rivers Rhine and Maas reduced the risk of flooding and is considered to be the greatest achievement in Dutch hydraulic engineering before the completion of the Zuiderzee Works and Delta Works. In 1904, the Maas was damned off at its southern end and given an artificial mouth, the Bergse Maas. The closed off portion was then named the &quot;Afgedamde Maas&quot; and was connected to the Bergse Maas via the Heusden Canal to retain shipping between the Maas and Rhine. Floods of the waterway in 1993 and 1995, however, created the need to be able to close the Heusden Canal off from the Bergse Maas and maintain a fixed water level, and the Kromme Nolkering (nl) control lock was completed in 2002. 
==Transport==
There is a car ferry, not operating on Sundays, and a foot passenger ferry.

<text>The Haringvliet is a large inlet of the North Sea, in the province of South Holland in the Netherlands. It is an important estuary of the Rhine-Meuse delta.

Near Numansdorp, the Hollands Diep splits into the Haringvliet and the Volkerak estuaries. It is closed off near Goedereede from the North Sea by the Haringvlietdam, which provides a road connection between the island of Voorne to the north and the island of Goeree-Overflakkee to the south. The dam with its sluices was built as part of the Delta Works sea barrier protection works.

The Haringvliet estuary contains the island of Tiengemeten, which is separated from the river island of Hoeksche Waard by the Vuile Gat strait.

==History==

The Haringvliet was formed as a result of the extensive flooding event of 1216, which breached the dunes of Voorne and created a deep saltwater inlet. During a second flooding event, the St. Elizabeth floods of 1421, this inlet connected to the Merwede and became an important estuary of the Rhine and Meuse rivers.

It used to be ecologically rich, and its brackish waters, fed by both rivers and sea, supported a healthy population of seals. It also provided an access point for migrating fish like salmon and sturgeon. As a result of the North Sea flood of 1953 the Haringvliet was closed off by the Haringvlietdam. The Haringvliet lost its estuarine characteristics and became a freshwater lake. Because of that, the seals are gone and migrating fish can only enter the Rhine-Meuse Delta through the busy and heavy industrialised Nieuwe Waterweg.

There are plans to permanently open a few of the Haringvliet sluices, to partly restore the ecosystem.

<text>Valis (stylized as VALIS) is a 1981 science fiction novel by American writer Philip K. Dick, intended to be the first book of a three-part series. The title is an acronym for &quot;Vast Active Living Intelligence System&quot;, Dick&#x27;s gnostic vision of God. Set in California during the 1970s, the book features heavy auto-biographical elements and draws inspiration from Dick&#x27;s own investigations into his unexplained religious experiences over the previous decade.

It is the first book in the incomplete &quot;VALIS trilogy&quot; of novels, followed by &quot;The Divine Invasion&quot; (1981). The planned third novel, &quot;The Owl in Daylight&quot;, had not yet taken definite shape at the time of the author&#x27;s death. Dick&#x27;s final novel, &quot;The Transmigration of Timothy Archer&quot; (1982), builds on similar themes; Dick wrote: &quot;the three do form a trilogy constellating around a basic theme.&quot;

==Synopsis==
In March 1974, Horselover Fat (the alter-personality of Philip K. Dick) experiences visions of a pink beam of light that he calls Zebra and interprets as a theophany exposing hidden facts about the reality of our universe, and a group of others join him in researching these matters. One of their theories is that there is some kind of alien space probe in orbit around Earth, and that it is aiding them in their quest; it also aided the United States in disclosing the Watergate scandal and the resignation of Richard Nixon in August 1974. 

Kevin turns his friends on to a film, &quot;Valis&quot;, that contains obvious references to revelations identical to those that Horselover Fat has experienced, including what appears to be time dysfunction. The film is itself a fictional account of an alternative-universe version of Nixon (Ferris F. Fremount) and his fall, engineered by a satellite called . (The plot of the fictitious film &quot;Valis&quot; was that of Dick&#x27;s then-unpublished novel &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot;.) 

In seeking the film&#x27;s makers, Kevin, Phil, Fat, and David—now calling themselves the Rhipidon Society—head to an estate owned by popular musician Eric Lampton and his wife Linda. They decide the goal that they have been led toward is Sophia Lampton, who is two years old and the Messiah or incarnation of Holy Wisdom (&quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;) anticipated by some variants of Gnostic Christianity. In addition to healing Phil&#x27;s schizophrenic personality split, she tells them that their conclusions about (which Fat had previously termed &quot;Zebra&quot;) and reality are correct, and more importantly, that we should worship, not gods, but humanity. She dies two days later due to a laser accident caused by Brent Mini. 

Undeterred, Fat (who has now resurged) goes on a global search for the &quot;next&quot; incarnation of Sophia.

Dick also offers a rationalist explanation of his apparent theophany, acknowledging that it might have been visual and auditory hallucinations from either schizophrenia or drug addiction sequelae.

==Characters==
* Phil (Philip K. Dick): Narrator (first person), science fiction writer, author of &quot;Man in the High Castle&quot;, &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;, and &quot;Three Stigmata&quot;.
* Horselover Fat: Narrator (third person), a schizophrenic modality of Phil himself. (&quot;Philip&quot; in Greek means &quot;fond of horses&quot;; &quot;dick&quot; is German for &quot;fat&quot;.)
* Gloria Knudson: Suicidal friend of Fat&#x27;s who Fat is unable to save.
* Kevin: Cynical friend of Fat&#x27;s whose cat died running across the street, based on K. W. Jeter.
* Sherri Solvig: Church-going friend of Fat&#x27;s, eventually dies from lymphatic cancer.
* David: Catholic friend of Fat&#x27;s, based on Tim Powers.
* Eric Lampton: Rock star, screenwriter, actor, a. k. a. &quot;Mother Goose&quot;; a fictionalised version of David Bowie. Name derived from that of rock star Eric Clapton.
* Linda Lampton: Actress, wife of Eric Lampton.
* Brent Mini: Electronic composer, a fictionalised version of Brian Eno.
* Sophia Lampton: Two-year-old child (personalised incarnation of Holy Wisdom within some variants of Gnosticism), said to be the daughter of Linda Lampton and and the &quot;Fifth Savior&quot;.

===The Rhipidon Society===
Phil, Fat, Kevin, and David decide to call themselves the Rhipidon Society. The motto they adopt is, &quot;Fish cannot carry guns.&quot;

==Planned trilogy==
&quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot;, a posthumously published earlier version of &quot;VALIS&quot;, is not included as a component of the &quot;VALIS&quot; trilogy. Dick completed one more novel after &quot;The Divine Invasion&quot;, &quot;The Transmigration of Timothy Archer&quot; (1982), based on Dick&#x27;s association with Bishop James A. Pike and which, while not referencing VALIS directly, is thematically similar. According to Dick, these three books &quot;form a trilogy constellating around a basic theme.&quot;

==Reception==
Greg Costikyan reviewed &quot;Valis&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #9 and commented that &quot;The plot is minor, the characterization poor, and the prose unexciting; philosophy and deft manipulation of mood are not enough to carry the book.&quot;

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Valis&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #98, and stated that &quot;Here a hard-headed Dick gently mocks the weird metaphysics of Fat through a series of wonderfully insane conversations and misadventures: a slapstick-tightrope-dance over a bit of potential insanity, a wrestle with demons in which (both inside and outside &quot;Valis&quot;) Dick is the unexpected winner.&quot;

Thomas M. Disch reported that &quot;the fascination of the book, what&#x27;s most artful and confounding about it, is the way the line between Dick and Fat shifts and wavers.&quot; Disch concludes that &quot;as a novel, as a &quot;whole&quot; novel... it went off the rails sometimes. But the first half holds together wonderfully, considering how much there is to be held together.&quot;

Umberto Rossi posits that some degree of academic discomfort towards the novel has resulted from uncertainty whether Dick genuinely believed in the more fantastical aspects of the narrative (further supported by the Exegesis which followed). In detailing the many ideological shunts between skepticism and belief which occur within the plot, Rossi concludes Dick intended neither view to achieve hegemony, but that the synthesis of both effectively depict &quot;the unyielding contradictions in [Dick&#x27;s] experience of self... Being involved in a quest does not automatically confer enlightenment, but rather involves a search for the light; the condition of the quester is one of doubt, not certainty.&quot;

== Dick&#x27;s &quot;Exegesis&quot; ==
V has been described as one node of an artificial satellite network originating from the star Sirius in the Canis Major constellation. According to Dick, the Earth satellite used &quot;pink laser beams&quot; to transfer information and project holograms on Earth and to facilitate communication between an extraterrestrial species and humanity. Dick claimed that used &quot;disinhibiting stimuli&quot; to communicate, using symbols to trigger recollection of intrinsic knowledge through the loss of amnesia, achieving gnosis. Drawing directly from Platonism and Gnosticism, Dick wrote in his &quot;Exegesis&quot;: &quot;We appear to be memory coils (DNA carriers capable of experience) in a computer-like thinking system which, although we have correctly recorded and stored thousands of years of experiential information, and each of us possesses somewhat different deposits from all the other life forms, there is a malfunction—a failure—of memory retrieval.&quot;

At one point, Dick claimed to be in a state of enthousiasmos with , where he was informed his infant son was in danger of perishing from an unnamed malady. Routine checkups on the child had shown no trouble or illness; however, Dick insisted that thorough tests be run to ensure his son&#x27;s health. The doctor eventually complied, despite the fact that there were no apparent symptoms. During the examination doctors discovered an inguinal hernia, which would have killed the child if an operation was not quickly performed. His son survived thanks to the operation, which Dick attributed to the &quot;intervention&quot; of .

Another event was an episode of supposed xenoglossia. Supposedly, Dick&#x27;s wife transcribed the sounds she heard him speak, and discovered that he was speaking Koine Greek—the common Greek dialect during the Hellenistic years (3rd century BC–4th century AD) and direct &quot;father&quot; of today&#x27;s modern Greek language—which he had never studied. As Dick was to later discover, Koine Greek was originally used to write the New Testament and the Septuagint. However, this was not the first time Dick had claimed xenoglossia: a decade earlier, Dick insisted he was able to think, speak, and read fluent Latin under the influence of Sandoz LSD-25.

The UK edition of &quot;VALIS&quot; also included &quot;Cosmology and Cosmogony&quot;, a chapbook containing selections from Dick&#x27;s &quot;Exegesis&quot;.

==Philosophical and cultural references==
Theology and philosophy, especially metaphysical philosophy, play an important role in &quot;VALIS&quot;, presenting not just Dick&#x27;s (and/or Horselover Fat&#x27;s) own views on these subjects but also his interpretation of numerous religions and philosophies of the past. The most prominent religious references are to Valentinian Gnosticism, the Rose Cross Brotherhood, Zoroastrianism and Buddhism, as well as Biblical writings including the Book of Daniel and the New Testament epistles. Many ancient Greek philosophers are discussed, including several Pre-Socratics (Pythagoras, Xenophanes, Heraclitus, Empedocles, and Parmenides) as well as Plato and Aristotle. More recent thinkers that are mentioned include the philosophers Pascal and Schopenhauer, the Christian mystic Jakob Böhme, the alchemist Paracelsus, Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud, the Romanian historian of religion Mircea Eliade, and the author and psychologist Robert Anton Wilson. In Wilson&#x27;s autobiographical &quot;Cosmic Trigger&quot; (released shortly before Dick commenced work on &quot;VALIS&quot;), Wilson describes similar musings concerning the &#x27;Sirius Connection&#x27;, contemplating the idea that alien entities are sending out waves of information that we can tune in on. &quot;VALIS&quot; specifically mentions the Dogon people, saying that they had encountered three-eyed people who had descended from Ikhnaton. References are also made to numerous deities, including Yurugu (who it associates with Yin) and Nommo (who it associates with Yang); it also suggests a blind, mad creator deity called Yaldaboath or Samael. The novel frequently references the 1945 discovery at Nag Hammadi.

The action of &quot;VALIS&quot; is set firmly in the American popular culture of its time, with references to the Grateful Dead, Frank Zappa, and Linda Ronstadt, as well as the fictional rock musicians Eric Lampton and Brent Mini (likely based on David Bowie and Brian Eno respectively). However, the novel also contains a number of high culture references such as the poets Vaughan, Wordsworth, and Goethe, and the classical composers Handel and Wagner. In particular, the novel contains several extended discussions about Wagner&#x27;s metaphysical opera &quot;Parsifal&quot;.

===Black Iron Prison===
&quot;The Black Iron Prison&quot; is a concept of an all-pervasive system of social control postulated in the &quot;Tractates Cryptica Scriptura&quot;, a summary of an unpublished Gnostic exegesis included in &quot;VALIS&quot;. Dick wrote:

==In popular culture==
&quot;VALIS&quot; was adapted in 1987 as an electronic opera by composer Tod Machover, and performed at Centre Georges Pompidou, with live singers and video installations created by artist Catherine Ikam.

On February 1, 2004, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that Utopia Pictures &amp; Television had acquired the rights to three of Philip K. Dick&#x27;s works: &quot;Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said&quot;, &quot;VALIS&quot;, and &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot;.

&quot;VALIS&quot; appeared in the TV show &quot;Lost&quot;. In the episode &quot;Eggtown&quot;, aired February 21, 2008, the character John Locke gives Ben Linus the book to read from Ben&#x27;s own book shelf, while Ben is being held captive. In &quot;The Other Woman&quot;, aired March 6, 2008, Ben is again shown reading the novel before being interrupted by Locke.

John Alan Simon, director of the film adaptation of &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot;, remarked that &quot;VALIS&quot; will form the basis of a sequel to that film if it is successful: &quot;Since &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot; is essentially the first draft of &quot;VALIS&quot;, we ended up with rights to both from the estate of Philip K. Dick. If &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot; is successful, &quot;VALIS&quot; the book would form the basis for the sequel to &quot;VALIS&quot; the movie. In other words, the story of &quot;VALIS&quot; would form the basis for &quot;VALIS 2&quot;.&quot;

British indie rock band Bloc Party has a song titled &quot;V.A.L.I.S.&quot; on their 2012 album &quot;Four&quot;.

Progressive metal band Tacoma Narrows Bridge Disaster have songs named &quot;Exegesis&quot;, &quot;Valis&quot; and &quot;Black Iron Prison&quot;, all inspired by Dick&#x27;s work, on their 2012 album &quot;Exegesis&quot;.

Portuguese double bassist Hugo Carvalhais&#x27;s 3rd album &quot;Grand Valis&quot; (Clean Feed Records 2015) is inspired by Dick&#x27;s book.

Grant Morrison used &quot;VALIS&quot; as a source of inspiration for &quot;The Invisibles&quot;, in particular for the Barbelith sentient satellite.

<text>The Bergsche Maas (; current spelling: Bergsche Maas) is a canal that was constructed in 1904 to be a branch of the river Maas (French: Meuse) in the Dutch province of North Brabant. The Maas splits near Heusden into the Afgedamde Maas and the Bergse Maas. The Afgedamde Maas flows north until its confluence with the river Waal (the main distributary of the river Rhine) to form the Merwede, while the Bergse Maas continues west as the main distributary of the Maas. Part of the Merwede (the Nieuwe Merwede) rejoins the Bergse Maas to form the Hollands Diep estuary.

== History ==
Historically, a natural branch of the Maas flowed from Heusden to the Amer and Hollands Diep estuary; this branch silted up and now forms a stream called Oude Maasje. The Bergse Maas, which takes its name from the town of Geertruidenberg, was constructed in its basin to take over its functions, in 1904. The other main distributary of the Maas was at the same time dammed-up and renamed Afgedamde Maas (&quot;Dammed-up Meuse&quot;). The resulting separation of the rivers Rhine and Maas reduced the risk of flooding and is considered to be the greatest achievement in Dutch hydraulic engineering before the completion of the Zuiderzee Works and Delta Works.

== Transport ==
There are two road bridges and three car ferries. The latter are free of charge for all traffic, as promised to the people living in the area when the Bergse Maas was dug.

<doc id="205809" wikidata="Q684748" url="?curid=205809" title="Lester del Rey">
<text>Lester del Rey (June 2, 1915 – May 10, 1993) was an American science fiction author and editor. He was the author of many books in the juvenile Winston Science Fiction series, and the fantasy editor at Del Rey Books, the fantasy and science fiction imprint of Ballantine Books, subsequently Random House, working for his fourth wife Judy-Lynn del Rey’s imprint, Del Rey.

==Biography==
===Original name===
Del Rey often told people that his real name was Ramon Felipe Alvarez-del Rey (and sometimes facetiously even Ramón Felipe San Juan Mario Silvio Enrico Smith Heartcourt-Brace Sierra y Alvarez del Rey y de los Verdes). However, his sister has confirmed that his name was in fact Leonard Knapp. He also claimed that his family was killed in a car accident in 1935. In reality, the accident only killed his first wife.

===Career===
====Writing career====
Del Rey first started publishing stories in pulp magazines in the late 1930s, at the dawn of the so-called Golden Age of Science Fiction. He was associated with the most prestigious science fiction magazine of the era, &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, from the time its editor John W. Campbell published his first short story in the April 1938 issue: &quot;The Faithful&quot;, already under the name Lester del Rey. The December 1938 issue featured his story &quot;Helen O&#x27;Loy&quot; which was selected for the prestigious anthology &quot;The Science Fiction Hall of Fame&quot;. By the end of 1939 he had also placed stories in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; (edited by Farnsworth Wright) and &quot;Unknown&quot; (Campbell), which featured more horror and more fantasy respectively.

During a period when del Rey&#x27;s work was not selling well, he worked as a short order cook at the White Tower Restaurant in New York. After he married his second wife, Helen Schlaz, in 1945, he quit that job to write full-time.

In 1952, his first three novels were published in the Winston juvenile series, one of which (&quot;Rocket Jockey&quot;) appearing in an Italian-language edition in the same year. In the 1950s, del Rey was one of the main authors writing science fiction for adolescents, along with Robert A. Heinlein and Andre Norton. During this time some of his fiction was published under multiple pseudonyms, including &quot;Philip St. John&quot; and &quot;Erik van Lhin&quot;.

He continued publishing novels, as well as short fiction, both under his primary pseudonym Lester del Rey as well as a number of other pen names, at a fast pace through the 1950s and the early sixties. His novel writing slowed down toward the end of the sixties, with his last novel, &quot;Weeping May Tarry&quot; (written with Raymond F. Jones) appearing from Pinnacle Books in 1978.

====Editor and critic====
After meeting Scott Meredith at the 1947 World Science Fiction Convention, he began working as a first reader for the new Scott Meredith Literary Agency, where he also served as office manager.

He later became an editor for several pulp magazines and then for book publishers. During 1952 and 1953, del Rey edited several magazines: &quot;Space SF&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Fiction&quot;, &quot;Science Fiction Adventures&quot; (as Philip St. John), &quot;Rocket Stories&quot; (as Wade Kaempfert), and &quot;Fantasy Fiction&quot; (as Cameron Hall). During this period he also edited several anthologies, notably editing the &quot;Best Science Fiction Stories of the Year&quot; series from 1972 to 1976.

Del Rey was most successful editing with his fourth wife, Judy-Lynn del Rey, at Ballantine Books (as a Random House property, post-Ballantine) where they established the fantasy and science fiction imprint Del Rey Books in 1977. He retired from the publishing house in February 1992.

In 1957, del Rey and Damon Knight co-edited a small amateur magazine named &quot;Science Fiction Forum&quot;. During a debate about symbolism within the magazine, del Rey accepted Knight&#x27;s challenge to write an analysis of the James Blish story &quot;Common Time&quot; that showed the story was about a man eating a ham sandwich. After science fiction gained respectability and began to be taught in classrooms, del Rey stated that academics interested in the genre should &quot;get out of my ghetto.&quot; Del Rey stated that &quot;to develop science fiction had to remove itself from the usual critics who viewed it from the perspective of [the] mainstream, and who judged its worth largely on its mainstream values. As part of that mainstream, it would never have had the freedom to make the choices it did — many of them quite possibly wrong, but necessary for its development.&quot;

Starting in September 1969, he wrote the &quot;Reading Room&quot; review column for &quot;If&quot;, and following the demise of &quot;If&quot; in 1974, switched to writing the review column for &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot; titled &quot;The Reference Library&quot;.

Del Rey was a member of a literary banqueting club, the Trap Door Spiders, which served as the basis of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s fictional group of mystery solvers, the Black Widowers. Del Rey was the model for &quot;Emmanuel Rubin&quot;.

===Death===
Lester del Rey died on May 10, 1993, at New York Hospital at the age of 77 after a brief illness.

==Style==
&quot;There is no writer in this field who is more steadfast in practicing the rule that fiction is first of all entertainment&quot;, Algis Budrys said in 1965. Reporting that the stories in a collection of del Rey&#x27;s fiction could not be dated by reading them, Budrys stated that he had remained a successful writer because &quot;del Rey has remained his own individual ... he writes for himself, and his readers&quot;. Budrys said that

==Awards==
Del Rey was awarded the 1972 E. E. Smith Memorial Award for Imaginative Fiction (the &quot;Skylark&quot;) by the New England Science Fiction Association for &quot;contributing significantly to science fiction, both through work in the field and by exemplifying the personal qualities that made the late &quot;Doc&quot; Smith well-loved by those who knew him&quot;. He also won a special 1985 Balrog Award for his contributions to fantasy, voted by fans and organized by &quot;Locus&quot; magazine. The Science Fiction Writers of America named him its 11th SFWA Grand Master in 1990, presented 1991.

<text>The Nieuwe Merwede (; &quot;New Merwede&quot;) is a Dutch canal, mainly fed by the river Rhine, that was constructed in 1870 to form a branch in the Rhine–Meuse delta. It was dug along the general trajectories of a number of minor Biesbosch creeks to reduce the risk of flooding by diverting the water away from the Beneden Merwede, and to facilitate navigation and regulate river traffic in the increasingly silted-up delta.

It is one of several rivers called Merwede. The most upstream is the river Boven Merwede (&quot;Upper Merwede&quot;), itself the continuation of the Rhine-Waal river and, until 1904, the Meuse (now the closed-off Afgedamde Maas) as well. The Boven Merwede branches near the town of Hardinxveld-Giessendam into River Beneden Merwede (&quot;Lower Merwede&quot;) to the northwest and the Nieuwe Merwede to the southwest. The Nieuwe Merwede joins River Bergse Maas near Lage Zwaluwe to form the Hollands Diep estuary, and separates the Island of Dordrecht from the Biesbosch National Park.

There are no bridges or tunnels crossing the Nieuwe Merwede, but there is a car ferry from the Island of Dordrecht on the west at &quot;Kop van &#x27;t Land&quot; to Brabantse Oever, Werkendam (Biesbosch).

<text>Richard Ewing Powell (November 14, 1904 – January 2, 1963) was an American actor, singer, musician, producer, director, and studio head. Though he came to stardom as a musical comedy performer, he showed versatility and successfully transformed into a hardboiled leading man, starring in projects of a more dramatic nature. He was the first actor to portray private detective Philip Marlowe on screen.

==Early life==
Powell was born the middle of three sons of Ewing Powell and mother Sally Rowena in Mountain View, Arkansas. 

He married Mildred Maund, a model, but she found being married to an entertainer not to her liking. After a final trip to Cuba together, Mildred moved to Hemphill, Texas, and the couple divorced in 1932. Later, Powell joined the Charlie Davis Orchestra, based in Indianapolis. He recorded a number of records with Davis and on his own for the Vocalion label in the late 1920s.

==Stardom==
Powell moved to Pittsburgh, where he found great local success as the master of ceremonies at the Enright Theater and the Stanley Theater.

===Warner Bros.===
In April 1930, Warner Bros. bought Brunswick Records, which at that time owned Vocalion. Warner Bros. was sufficiently impressed by Powell&#x27;s singing and stage presence to offer him a film contract in 1932. He made his film debut as a singing bandleader in &quot;Blessed Event&quot;.

He was borrowed by Fox Film to support Will Rogers in &quot;Too Busy to Work&quot; (1932). He was a boyish crooner, the sort of role in which he specialized for the next few years. Back at Warner Bros., he supported George Arliss in &quot;The King&#x27;s Vacation&quot;, then was in &quot;42nd Street&quot; (both 1933), playing the love interest for Ruby Keeler. The film was a massive hit. 

Warner Bros. (WB) got him basically to repeat the role in &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot;, another big success. So too was &quot;Footlight Parade&quot; (also 1933), with Keeler and James Cagney.

Powell was upped to star for &quot;College Coach&quot; (1933), then went back to more ensemble pieces including &quot;42nd Street&quot;, &quot;Convention City&quot; (both 1933), &quot;Wonder Bar&quot;, &quot;Twenty Million Sweethearts&quot;, and &quot;Dames&quot; (all 1934).

&quot;Happiness Ahead&quot; was more of a star vehicle for Powell, as was &quot;Flirtation Walk&quot; (both 1934). He was top-billed in &quot;Gold Diggers of 1935&quot; and &quot;Broadway Gondolier&quot; (both 1935), both with Joan Blondell. He supported Marion Davies in &quot;Page Miss Glory&quot; (1935), made for Cosmopolitan Pictures, a production company financed by Davies&#x27; lover William Randolph Hearst, who released through WB. 

WB gave him a change of pace, casting him as Lysander in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1935).

More typical was &quot;Shipmates Forever&quot; (1935) with Keeler. 20th Century Fox borrowed him for &quot;Thanks a Million&quot; (1935); back at WB, he did &quot;Colleen&quot; (1936) with Keeler and Blondell. Powell was reunited with Marion Davies in another for Cosmopolitan, &quot;Hearts Divided&quot; (1936), playing Napoleon&#x27;s brother.

He made three films with Blondell, Broadway Gondolier&quot; (1935), &quot;Stage Struck&quot; (1936) and &quot;Gold Diggers of 1937&quot;. 20th Century Fox then borrowed him again for &quot;On the Avenue&quot; (1937).

Back at WB, he appeared in &quot;The Singing Marine&quot; and &quot;Varsity Show&quot; (both 1937), &quot;Hollywood Hotel&quot;, &quot;Cowboy from Brooklyn&quot;, &quot;Hard to Get&quot;, &quot;Going Places&quot; (all 1938), and &quot;Naughty but Nice&quot; (1939). Fed up with the repetitive nature of these roles, Powell left WB and went to work for Paramount Pictures.

===Paramount===
At Paramount, Blondell and Powell were cast together again in the drama &quot;I Want a Divorce&quot; (1940). Then Powell got a chance to appear in another non-musical, &quot;Christmas in July&quot; (1940), a screwball comedy which was the second feature directed by Preston Sturges.

Universal borrowed him to support Abbott and Costello in &quot;In the Navy&quot; (1941), one of the most popular films of 1941. At Paramount he had a cameo in &quot;Star Spangled Rhythm&quot; and co-starred with Mary Martin in &quot;Happy Go Lucky&quot; (both 1943). He supported Dorothy Lamour in &quot;Riding High&quot; (1943).

In 1944, he was in a fantasy comedy directed by René Clair, &quot;It Happened Tomorrow&quot;, then went over to MGM to appear opposite Lucille Ball in &quot;Meet the People&quot;, which was a box-office flop.

During this period, Powell starred in the musical &quot;Campana Serenade&quot;, which was broadcast on NBC radio (1942–1943) and CBS radio (1943–1944).

==&quot;Tough guy&quot;==
By 1944, Powell felt he was too old to play romantic leading men anymore, so he lobbied to play the lead in &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;. He lost out to Fred MacMurray, another Hollywood nice guy.

Powell&#x27;s career changed dramatically when he was cast in the first of a series of films noir, as private detective Philip Marlowe in &quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot; (1944), directed by Edward Dmytryk at RKO. The film was a big hit, and Powell had successfully reinvented himself as a dramatic actor. He was the first actor to play Marlowe – by name – in motion pictures.

In 1945, Dmytryk and Powell reteamed to make the film &quot;Cornered&quot;, a gripping post-World War II thriller that helped define the film noir style.

For Columbia, he played a casino owner in &quot;Johnny O&#x27;Clock&quot; (1947) and made &quot;To the Ends of the Earth&quot; (1948). Also in 1948, he stepped out of the brutish type when he starred in &quot;Pitfall&quot;, a film noir in which a bored insurance-company worker falls for an innocent but dangerous woman, played by Lizabeth Scott.

He broadened his range appearing in a Western, &quot;Station West&quot; (1948) and a French Foreign Legion tale, &quot;Rogues&#x27; Regiment&quot; (1949). He was a Mountie in &quot;Mrs. Mike&quot; (1950).

From 1949 to 1953, Powell played the lead role in the NBC radio theater production &quot;Richard Diamond, Private Detective&quot;. His character in the 30-minute weekly show was a likable private detective with a quick wit. Many episodes ended with Detective Diamond having an excuse to sing a little song to his date, showcasing Powell&#x27;s vocal abilities. Many of the episodes were written by Blake Edwards. When &quot;Richard Diamond&quot; came to television in 1957, the lead role was portrayed by David Janssen, who did no singing in the series. Prior to the &quot;Richard Diamond&quot; series, he starred in &quot;Rogue&#x27;s Gallery&quot;. He played Richard Rogue, private detective. The Richard Diamond tongue-in-cheek persona developed in the &quot;Rogue&quot; series.

Powell took a break from tough-guy roles in &quot;The Reformer and the Redhead&quot; (1950), opposite wife June Allyson. Then he was back to tougher movies: &quot;Right Cross&quot; (1950), a boxing film with Allyson; &quot;Cry Danger&quot; (1951), as an ex-convict; &quot;The Tall Target&quot; (1951), at MGM directed by Anthony Mann, playing a detective who tries to prevent the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.

He returned to comedy with &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot; (1951). Powell had a supporting role in MGM&#x27;s popular melodrama &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (1952). His final film performance was in a romantic comedy &quot;Susan Slept Here&quot; (1954) for director Frank Tashlin.

Even when he appeared in lighter fare such as &quot;The Reformer and the Redhead&quot; and &quot;Susan Slept Here&quot;, he never sang in his later roles. The latter, his final onscreen appearance in a feature film, did include a dance number with co-star Debbie Reynolds.

==Director==
By this stage, Powell had turned director. His feature debut was &quot;Split Second&quot; (1953) at RKO Pictures. He followed it with &quot;The Conqueror&quot; (1956), coproduced by Howard Hughes and starring John Wayne as Genghis Khan. The exterior scenes were filmed in St. George, Utah, downwind of U.S. above-ground atomic tests. The cast and crew totaled 220, and of that number, 91 had developed some form of cancer by 1981, and 46 had died of cancer by then, including Powell and Wayne.

He directed Allyson opposite Jack Lemmon in &quot;You Can&#x27;t Run Away from It&quot; (1956). Powell then made two war films at Fox with Robert Mitchum, &quot;The Enemy Below&quot; (1957) and &quot;The Hunters&quot; (1958).

==Television==
In the 1950s, Powell was one of the founders of Four Star Television, with Charles Boyer, David Niven, and Ida Lupino. He appeared in and supervised several shows for that company. Shortly before his death, Powell sang on camera for the final time in a guest-star appearance on Four Star&#x27;s &quot;Ensign O&#x27;Toole&quot;, singing &quot;The Song of the Marines&quot;, which he first sang in his 1937 film &quot;The Singing Marine.&quot; He hosted and occasionally starred in his &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theater&quot; on CBS from 1956 to 1961, and his final anthology series, &quot;The Dick Powell Show&quot; on NBC from 1961 through 1963; after his death, the series continued through the end of its second season (as &quot;The Dick Powell Theater&quot;), with guest hosts.

==Personal life==

Powell was the son of Ewing Powell and Sallie Rowena Thompson. 

He married three times:
* Mildred Evelyn Maund (b. 1906, d. 1967). The couple married in 1925, and appear on the 1930 census in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where Powell was working in a theater, and on a 1931 passenger list for the , returning from Havana, Cuba. They divorced in 1932, although Mildred retained her married name. 
* Joan Blondell (married September 19, 1936, divorced 1944). He adopted her son from a previous marriage, Norman Powell, who later became a television producer; the couple also had one child together, Ellen Powell. 
* June Allyson (August 19, 1945, until his death, January 2, 1963), with whom he had two children, Pamela (adopted) and Richard Powell, Jr. 

Powell&#x27;s ranch-style house was used for exterior filming on the ABC TV series, &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;. The estate, known as Amber Hills, was on in the Mandeville Canyon section of Brentwood, Los Angeles.

Powell enjoyed general aviation as a private pilot. He and Farouk of Egypt were the only two known buyers of the Gaylord Gladiator automobile.

==Illness and death==
On September 27, 1962, Powell acknowledged rumors that he was undergoing treatment for cancer. The disease was originally diagnosed as an allergy, with Powell first experiencing symptoms while traveling east to promote his program. Upon his return to California, Powell&#x27;s personal physician conducted tests and found malignant tumors on his neck and chest.

The marker on Dick Powell&#x27;s niche in Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, California, incorrectly identifies his year of death as 1962. Powell died at the age of 58 on January 2, 1963. 

It is speculated Powell developed cancer as a result of his participation in the film &quot;The Conqueror&quot;, which was filmed at St. George, Utah, near a site used by the U.S. military for nuclear testing. About a third of the actors who participated in the film developed cancer, including Powell, who directed the film, John Wayne, Susan Hayward, Agnes Moorehead and Pedro Armendáriz. However, in a 2001 interview with Larry King, Powell&#x27;s widow June Allyson stated that the cause of death was lung cancer due to his chain smoking.

During the 15th Primetime Emmy Awards on May 26, 1963, the Television Academy presented a posthumous Television Academy Trustee Award to Dick Powell for his contributions to the industry. The award was accepted by two of his former partners in Four Star Television, Charles Boyer and David Niven.

Dick Powell has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6915 Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>Sylpheed is an open-source e-mail client and news client licensed under GNU GPL-2.0-or-later with the library part &quot;LibSylph&quot; under GNU LGPL-2.1-or-later. It provides easy configuration and an abundance of features. It stores mail in the MH Message Handling System. Sylpheed runs on Unix-like systems such as Linux or BSD, and it is also usable on Windows. It uses GTK+.

In 2005, Sylpheed was forked to create Sylpheed-Claws, now known as Claws Mail. As of 2020, both projects continue to be developed independently.

Sylpheed is the default mail client in Lubuntu, Damn Small Linux and some flavours of Puppy Linux.

==Features==
===Spam filtering===
Sylpheed provides support for spam filtering using either bogofilter or bsfilter, at the user&#x27;s choice. Bsfilter is shipped with the Windows version of Sylpheed.

===Plug-ins===
Sylpheed supports the development of plug-ins. As of February 2015, Sylpheed&#x27;s website notes an attachment-tool plug-in, an automatic mail forwarding plug-in, and a plug-in for determining whether or not attachments are password-protected.

===Limitations===
Sylpheed is unable to send HTML mail. This is intentional, since the developers consider HTML mail to be harmful. It is still possible to receive HTML mail using Sylpheed.

===Password===
The password is stored in plaintext in the Sylpheed configuration file, which by default is only readable by &quot;owner&quot; and not by &quot;group&quot; nor &quot;other&quot;. A feature called &quot;master password&quot; prevents Sylpheed from holding plaintext passwords, but does not protect stored messages from other local users with administrator privilege.

===Encryption===
Sylpheed includes natively PGP Sign and PGP Encrypt options in the compose window (which requires however an encryption tool based on PGP already installed on the computer). This function is simple to handle yet not intuitive to set up.

<text>James Fenimore Cooper (September 15, 1789 – September 14, 1851) was an American writer of the first half of the 19th century, whose historical romances depicting colonial and indigenous characters from the 17th to the 19th centuries brought him fame and fortune. He lived much of his boyhood and his last fifteen years in Cooperstown, New York, which was founded by his father William Cooper on property that he owned. Cooper became a member of the Episcopal Church shortly before his death and contributed generously to it. He attended Yale University for three years, where he was a member of the Linonian Society.

After a stint on a commercial voyage, Cooper served in the U.S. Navy as a midshipman, where he learned the technology of managing sailing vessels which greatly influenced many of his novels and other writings. The novel that launched his career was &quot;The Spy&quot;, a tale about espionage set during the American Revolutionary War and published in 1821. He also created American sea stories. His best-known works are five historical novels of the frontier period, written between 1823 and 1841, known as the &quot;Leatherstocking Tales&quot;, which introduced the iconic American frontier scout, Natty Bumppo. Cooper&#x27;s works on the U.S. Navy have been well received among naval historians, but they were sometimes criticized by his contemporaries. Among his more famous works is the Romantic novel &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;, often regarded as his masterpiece. Throughout his career, he published numerous social, political, and historical works of fiction and non-fiction with the objective of countering European prejudices and nurturing an original American art and culture.

== Early life and education==

Cooper was born in Burlington, New Jersey, in 1789 to William Cooper and Elizabeth (Fenimore) Cooper, the eleventh of 12 children, half of whom died during infancy or childhood.

Shortly after James&#x27; first birthday, his family moved to Cooperstown, New York, a community founded by his father on a large piece of land which he had bought for development. Later, his father was elected to the United States Congress as a representative from Otsego County. Their town was in a central area of New York along the headwaters of the Susquehanna River that had previously been patented to Colonel George Croghan by the Province of New York in 1769. Croghan mortgaged the land before the Revolution and after the war part of the tract was sold at public auction to William Cooper and his business partner Andrew Craig. By 1788, William Cooper had selected and surveyed the site where Cooperstown would be established. He erected a home on the shore of Otsego Lake and moved his family there in the autumn of 1790. Several years later he began construction of the mansion that became known as Otsego Hall, completed in 1799 when James was ten.

Cooper was enrolled at Yale University at age 13, but he incited a dangerous prank which involved blowing up another student&#x27;s door—after having already locked a donkey in a recitation room. He was expelled in his third year without completing his degree, so he obtained work in 1806 as a sailor and joined the crew of a merchant vessel at age 17. By 1811, he obtained the rank of midshipman in the fledgling United States Navy, conferred upon him by an officer&#x27;s warrant signed by Thomas Jefferson.

William Cooper had died more than a year before, in 1809, when James was 20. All five of his sons inherited a supposed-large fortune in money, securities, and land titles, which soon proved to be a wealth of endless litigation. James married Susan Augusta de Lancey at Mamaroneck, Westchester County, New York on January 1, 1811, at age 21. She was from a wealthy family (de Lancey family) who remained loyal to Great Britain during the Revolution. The Coopers had seven children, five of whom lived to adulthood. Their daughter Susan Fenimore Cooper was a writer on nature, female suffrage, and other topics. Her father edited her works and secured publishers for them. One son, Paul Fenimore Cooper, became a lawyer and perpetuated the author&#x27;s lineage to the present.

== Service in the Navy ==
In 1806 at the age of 17, Cooper joined the crew of the American merchant ship &quot;Sterling&quot; as a common sailor. At the time, &quot;Sterling&quot; was captained by young Mainer John Johnston. His first voyage onboard &quot;Sterling&quot; took him to the English port of Cowes in the Isle of Wight after 40 stormy days. There, the crew acquired information on which British port was best to sell their cargo of flour at. While anchored off Cowes, &quot;Sterling&quot; was approached by a Royal Navy warship, which sent a boarding party to the merchant ship. The boarding party proceeded to impress a suspected deserter from the Royal Navy before departing. 

Their next voyage took them to the Mediterranean along the coast of Spain, including Águilas and Cabo de Gata, where they picked up cargo to be taken to London and unloaded. Their stay in Spain lasted several weeks and impressed the young sailor, the accounts of which Cooper later referred to in his &quot;Mercedes of Castile&quot;, a novel about Columbus.

After serving aboard the &quot;Sterling&quot; for 11 months, he joined the United States Navy on January 1, 1808, when he received his commission as a midshipman. Cooper had conducted himself well as a sailor, and his father, a former U.S. Congressman, easily secured a commission for him through his long-standing connections with politicians and naval officials. The warrant for Cooper&#x27;s commission as midshipman was signed by President Jefferson and mailed by Naval Secretary Robert Smith, reaching Cooper on February 19. On February 24, he received orders to report to the naval commander at New York City. Joining the United States Navy fulfilled an aspiration he had had since his youth.

Cooper&#x27;s first naval assignment came on March 21, 1808, aboard the , an 82-foot bomb ketch that carried twelve guns and a thirteen-inch mortar. For his next assignment, he served under Lieutenant Melancthon Taylor Woolsey near Oswego on Lake Ontario, overseeing the building of the brig for service on the lake. The vessel was intended for use in a potential war with Great Britain. The vessel was completed, armed with sixteen guns, and launched in Lake Ontario in the spring of 1809. It was in this service that Cooper learned shipbuilding, shipyard duties and frontier life. During his leisure time, Cooper would venture through the forests of New York state and explore the shores of Lake Ontario. He occasionally ventured into the Thousand Islands. His experiences in the Oswego area later inspired some of his work, including his novel &quot;The Pathfinder&quot;.

After completion of the &quot;Oneida&quot; in 1809, Cooper accompanied Woolsey to Niagara Falls, who then was ordered to Lake Champlain to serve aboard a gunboat until the winter months when the lake froze over. Cooper himself returned from Oswego to Cooperstown and then New York City. On November 13 of the same year, he was assigned to the under the command of Captain James Lawrence, who was from Burlington and became a personal friend of Cooper&#x27;s. Aboard this ship, he met his lifelong friend William Branford Shubrick, who was also a midshipman at the time. Cooper later dedicated &quot;The Pilot&quot;, &quot;The Red Rover&quot; and other writings to Shubrick. Assigned to humdrum recruiting tasks rather than exciting voyages, Cooper resigned his commission from the navy in spring 1810; in the same time period he met, wooed, and became engaged to Susan Augusta de Lancey, whom he married on January 1, 1811.

== Writings ==

=== First endeavors ===
In 1820, when reading a contemporary novel to his wife Susan, he decided to try his hand at fiction, resulting in a neophyte novel set in England he called &quot;Precaution&quot; (1820). Its focus on morals and manners was influenced by Jane Austen&#x27;s approach to fiction. &quot;Precaution&quot; was published anonymously and received modestly favorable notice in the United States and England. By contrast, his second novel &quot;The Spy&quot; (1821) was inspired by an American tale related to him by neighbor and family friend John Jay. It became the first novel written by an American to become a bestseller at home and abroad, requiring several re-printings to satisfy demand. Set in the &quot;Neutral Ground&quot; between British and American forces and their guerrilla allies in Westchester County, New York, the action centers on spying and skirmishing taking place in and around what is widely believed to be John Jay&#x27;s family home &quot;The Locusts&quot; in Rye, New York of which a portion still exists today as the historic Jay Estate.

Following on a swell of popularity, Cooper published &quot;The Pioneers&quot;, the first of the &quot;Leatherstocking&quot; series in 1823. The series features the inter-racial friendship of Natty Bumppo, a resourceful American woodsman who is at home with the Delaware Indians, and their chief, Chingachgook. Bumppo was also the main character of Cooper&#x27;s most famous novel &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1826), written in New York City where Cooper and his family lived from 1822 to 1826. The book became one of the more widely read American novels of the 19th century. At this time, Cooper had been living in New York on Beach Street in what is now downtown&#x27;s Tribeca.

In 1823, he became a member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia. In August of that same year, his first son died. He organized the influential Bread and Cheese Club that brought together American writers, editors, artists, scholars, educators, art patrons, merchants, lawyers, politicians, and others.

In 1824, General Lafayette arrived from France aboard the &quot;Cadmus&quot; at Castle Garden in New York City as the nation&#x27;s guest. Cooper witnessed his arrival and was one of the active committee of welcome and entertainment.

=== Europe ===
In 1826, Cooper moved his family to Europe, where he sought to gain more income from his books, provide better education for his children, improve his health, and observe European manners and politics firsthand. While overseas, he continued to write. His books published in Paris include &quot;The Prairie,&quot; the third Leather-Stocking Tale in which Natty Bumppo dies in the western land newly acquired by Jefferson as the Louisiana Purchase. There he also published &quot;The Red Rover&quot; and &quot;The Water Witch&quot;, two of his many sea stories. During his time in Paris, the Cooper family became active in the small American expatriate community. He became friends with painter (and later inventor) Samuel Morse and with French general and American Revolutionary War hero Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. Cooper admired the patrician liberalism of Lafayette, who sought to recruit him to his causes, and eulogized him as a man who &quot;dedicated youth, person, and fortune, to the principles of liberty.&quot;

In Europe, Cooper&#x27;s hostility to the perceived corruption of European aristocracy grew as he witnessed the effect they had on the politics of the United Kingdom and France, in particular what Cooper considered to be the power they held in national legislature and judiciaries to the exclusion of other classes. In 1832, he entered the lists as a political writer in a series of letters to &quot;Le National&quot;, a Parisian journal. He defended the United States against a string of charges brought by the &quot;Revue Britannique&quot;. For the rest of his life, he continued skirmishing in print, sometimes for the national interest, sometimes for that of the individual, and frequently for both at once.

This opportunity to make a political confession of faith reflected the political turn that he already had taken in his fiction, having attacked European anti-republicanism in &quot;The Bravo&quot; (1831). Cooper continued this political course in &quot;The Heidenmauer&quot; (1832) and &quot;The Headsman: The Abbaye des Vignerons&quot; (1833). &quot;The Bravo&quot; depicted Venice as a place where a ruthless oligarchy lurks behind the mask of the &quot;serene republic&quot;. All were widely read on both sides of the Atlantic, though some Americans accused Cooper of apparently abandoning American life for European—not realizing that the political subterfuges in the European novels were cautions directed at his American audiences. Thus &quot;The Bravo&quot; was roughly treated by some critics in the United States.

=== Back to America ===
In 1833, Cooper returned to the United States and published &quot;A Letter to My Countrymen&quot; in which he gave his criticism of various social and political mores. Promotional material from a modern publisher summarizes his goals as follows:

A Letter to My Countrymen remains Cooper&#x27;s most trenchant work of social criticism. In it, he defines the role of the &quot;man of letters&quot; in a republic, the true conservative, the slavery of party affiliations, and the nature of the legislative branch of government. He also offers her most persuasive argument on why America should develop its own art and literary culture, ignoring the aristocratically tainted art of Europe.

Influenced by the ideals of classical republicanism, Cooper feared that the orgy of speculation he witnessed was destructive of civic virtue and warned Americans that it was a &quot;mistake to suppose commerce favorable to liberty&quot;; doing so would lead to a new &quot;moneyed aristocracy&quot;. Drawing upon philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Burlamaqui, and Montesquieu, Cooper&#x27;s political ideas were both democratic, deriving from the consent of the governed, and liberal, concerned with the rights of the individual.

In the later 1830s—despite his repudiation of authorship in &quot;A Letter to My Countrymen&quot;—he published &quot;Gleanings in Europe&quot;, five volumes of social and political analysis of his observations and experiences in Europe. His two novels &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; and &quot;Home as Found&quot; also criticize the flamboyant financial speculation and toadyism he found on his return; some readers and critics attacked the works for presenting a highly idealized self-portrait, which he vigorously denied.

In June 1834, Cooper decided to reopen his ancestral mansion Otsego Hall at Cooperstown. It had long been closed and falling into decay; he had been absent from the mansion nearly 16 years. Repairs were begun, and the house was put in order. At first, he wintered in New York City and summered in Cooperstown, but eventually he made Otsego Hall his permanent home.

On May 10, 1839, Cooper published &quot;History of the Navy of the United States of America&quot;, a work that he had long planned on writing. He publicly announced his intentions to author such a historical work while abroad before departing for Europe in May 1826, during a parting speech at a dinner given in his honor:

Encouraged by your kindness ... I will take this opportunity of recording the deeds and sufferings of a class of men to which this nation owes a debt of gratitude—a class of men among whom, I am always ready to declare, not only the earliest, but many of the happiest days of my youth have been passed.

=== Historical and nautical work ===
Cooper&#x27;s historical account of the U.S. Navy was well received, though his account of the roles played by the American leaders in the Battle of Lake Erie led to years of disputes with their descendants, as noted below. Cooper had begun thinking about this massive project in 1824, and concentrated on its research in the late 1830s. His close association with the U.S. Navy and various officers, and his familiarity with naval life at sea provided him the background and connections to research and write this work. Cooper&#x27;s work is said to have stood the test of time and is considered an authoritative account of the U.S. Navy during that time.

In 1844, Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Proceedings of the naval court martial in the case of Alexander Slidell Mackenzie, a commander in the navy of the United States, &amp;c.&quot; was first published in &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine of 1843–44&quot;. It was a review of the court martial of Alexander Slidell Mackenzie who had hanged three crew members of the brig USS &quot;Somers&quot; for mutiny while at sea. One of the hanged men, 19-year-old Philip Spencer, was the son of U.S. Secretary of War John C. Spencer. He was executed without court-martial along with two other sailors aboard the &quot;Somers&quot; for attempting mutiny.

The Proceedings publication was one of Cooper&#x27;s print skirmishes. Maritime historian Samuel Eliot Morison called it vindictive revenge for Mackenzie&#x27;s publishing a critical review of Cooper&#x27;s inaccurate history of the Battle of Lake Erie, noting that Cooper &quot;flattered himself that his tract would &#x27;finish&#x27; Mackenzie as a naval officer, which it certainly did not.&quot; Others, however, assert that Cooper recognized the need for absolute discipline in a warship at sea, and felt sympathetic to Mackenzie over his pending court martial.

In 1843, an old shipmate, Ned Myers, re-entered Cooper&#x27;s life. To assist him—and hopefully to cash in on the popularity of maritime biographies—Cooper wrote Myers&#x27;s story which he published in 1843 as &quot;Ned Myers; or, A Life Before the Mast&quot;, an account of a common seaman still of interest to naval historians.

In 1846, Cooper published &quot;Lives of Distinguished American Naval Officers&quot; covering the biographies of William Bainbridge, Richard Somers, John Shaw, John Templar Shubrick, and Edward Preble. Cooper died in 1851. In May 1853, Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; appeared in Putnam&#x27;s Monthly. It was the history of the Navy ship and, after &quot;European and American Scenery Compared&quot;, 1852, was one of several posthumous publications of his writings. In 1856, five years after Cooper&#x27;s death, his &quot;History of the Navy of the United States of America&quot; was re-published in an expanded edition. The work was an account of the U.S. Navy in the early 19th century, through the Mexican War. Among naval historians of today, the work has come to be recognized as a general and authoritative account. However, it was criticized for accuracy on some points by some contemporaries, especially those engaged in the disputes over the roles of their relatives in Cooper&#x27;s separate history of the Battle of Lake Erie. Whig editors of the period regularly attacked anything Cooper wrote, leading him to numerous suits for libel, for example against Park Benjamin, Sr., a poet and editor of the &quot;Evening Signal&quot; of New York.

=== Critical reaction ===

Cooper&#x27;s writings of the 1830s related to current politics and social issues, coupled with his perceived self-promotion, increased the ill feeling between the author and some of the public. Criticism in print of his naval histories and the two &quot;Home&quot; novels came largely from newspapers supporting The Whig party, reflecting the antagonism between the Whigs and their opposition, the Democrats, whose policies Cooper often favored. Cooper&#x27;s father William had been a staunch Federalist, a party now defunct but some of whose policies supporting large-scale capitalism the Whigs endorsed. Cooper himself had come to admire Thomas Jefferson, the bete-noire of the Federalists, and had supported Andrew Jackson&#x27;s opposition to a National Bank. Never one to shrink from defending his personal honor and his sense of where the nation was erring, Cooper filed legal actions for libel against several Whig editors; his success with most of his lawsuits ironically led to more negative publicity from the Whig establishment.

Buoyed by his frequent victories in court, Cooper returned to writing with more energy and success than he had had for several years. As noted above, on May 10, 1839, he published his &quot;History of the U.S. Navy&quot;; his return to the &quot;Leatherstocking Tales&quot; series with &quot;The Pathfinder, or The Inland Sea&quot; (1840) and &quot;The Deerslayer&quot; (1841) brought him renewed favorable reviews. But on occasion he returned to addressing public issues, most notably with a trilogy of novels called the &quot;Littlepage Manuscripts&quot; addressing the issues of the anti-rent wars. Public sentiment largely favored the anti-renters, and Cooper&#x27;s reviews again were largely negative.

== Later life ==

Faced with competition from younger writers and magazine serialization, and lower prices for books resulting from new technologies, Cooper simply wrote more in his last decade than in either of the previous two. Half of his thirty-two novels were written in the 1840s. They may be grouped into three categories: Indian romances, maritime fiction, and political and social controversy—though the categories often overlap.

The 1840s began with the last two novels featuring Natty Bumppo, both critical and reader successes: &quot;The Pathfinder&quot; (1840) and &quot;The Deerslayer&quot; (1841). &quot;Wyandotte&quot;, his last novel set in the Revolutionary War, followed in 1843 and &quot;Oak Openings&quot; in 1848. The nautical works were &quot;Mercedes of Castile&quot; (in which Columbus appears, 1840), &quot;The Two Admirals&quot; (British and French fleets in battle, 1842), &quot;Wing-And-Wing&quot; (a French privateer fighting the British in 1799, 1842), &quot;Afloat and Ashore&quot; (two volumes exploring a young man growing up, 1844), &quot;Jack Tier&quot; (a vicious smuggler in the Mexican-American War, 1848), and &quot;The Sea Lions&quot; (rival sealers in the Antarctic, 1849).

He also turned from pure fiction to the combination of art and controversy in which he achieved notoriety in the novels of the previous decade. His &quot;Littlepage Manuscripts&quot; trilogy--&quot;Satanstoe&quot; (1845), &quot;The Chainbearer&quot; (1845), and &quot;The Redskins&quot; (1846)—dramatized issues of land ownership in response to renters in the 1840s opposing the long leases common in the old Dutch settlements in the Hudson Valley. He tried his hand with serialization with &quot;The Autobiography of a Pocket Handkerchief&quot;, first published in &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1843, a satire on contemporary nouveau riche. In &quot;The Crater; or, Vulcan&#x27;s Peak&quot; (1847) he introduced supernatural machinery to show the decline of an ideal society in the South Seas when demagogues prevail. &quot;The Ways of the Hour&quot;, his last completed novel, portrayed a mysterious and independent young woman defending herself against criminal charges.

Cooper spent the last years of his life back in Cooperstown. He died on September 14, 1851, the day before his 62nd birthday. He was buried in the Christ Episcopal Churchyard, where his father, William Cooper, was buried. Cooper&#x27;s wife Susan survived her husband only by a few months and was buried by his side at Cooperstown.

Several well-known writers, politicians, and other public figures honored Cooper&#x27;s memory with a memorial in New York, six months after his death, in February 1852. Daniel Webster gave a speech to the gathering while Washington Irving served as a co-chairman, along with William Cullen Bryant, who also gave an address which did much to restore Cooper&#x27;s damaged reputation among American writers of the time.

== Religious activities ==
Cooper&#x27;s father was a lapsed Quaker; probably influenced by his wife&#x27;s family, the DeLanceys, Cooper in his fiction often favorably depicted clergy of the Episcopal Church, though Calvinist ministers came in for their share of both admiring and critical treatment. In the 1840s as Cooper increasingly despaired over the United States maintaining the vision and promise of the Constitution, his fiction increasingly turned to religious themes. In &quot;The Wing-And-Wing&quot;, 1842, the hero, a French revolutionary free-thinker, loses the Italian girl he loves because he cannot accept her simple Christianity. In contrast, in the 1849 &quot;The Sea Lions&quot; the hero wins his beloved only after a spiritual transformation while marooned in the Antarctic. And the 1848 &quot;The Oak Openings&quot; features a pious Parson Amen who wins the admiration of the Indians who kill him, praying for them during torture.

After establishing permanent residence in Cooperstown, Cooper became active in Christ Episcopal Church, taking on the roles of warden and vestryman. As the vestryman, he donated generously to this church and later supervised and redesigned its interior with oak furnishings at his own expense. He was also energetic as a representative from Cooperstown to various regional conventions of the Episcopal church. But only several months before his death, in July 1851, was he confirmed in this church by his brother-in-law, the Reverend William H. DeLancey.

== Legacy ==

Cooper was one of the more popular 19th-century American authors, and his work was admired greatly throughout the world. While on his death bed, the Austrian composer Franz Schubert wanted most to read more of Cooper&#x27;s novels. Honoré de Balzac, the French novelist and playwright, admired him greatly. Henry David Thoreau, while attending Harvard, incorporated some of Cooper&#x27;s style in his own work. D.H. Lawrence believed that Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Maupassant, and Flaubert were all &quot;so very obvious and coarse, besides the lovely, mature and sensitive art of Fennimore Cooper.&quot; Lawrence called &quot;The Deerslayer&quot; &quot;one of the most beautiful and perfect books in the world: flawless as a jewel and of gem-like concentration.&quot;

Cooper&#x27;s work, particularly &quot;The Pioneers&quot; and &quot;The Pilot&quot;, demonstrate an early 19th-century American preoccupation with alternating prudence and negligence in a country where property rights were often still in dispute.

Cooper was one of the early major American novelists to include African, African-American and Native American characters in his works. In particular, Native Americans play central roles in his &quot;Leatherstocking Tales&quot;. However, his treatment of this group is complex and highlights the relationship between frontier settlers and American Indians as exemplified in &quot;The Wept of Wish-ton-Wish&quot;, depicting a captured white girl who marries an Indian chief and has a baby with him, but after several years is eventually returned to her parents. Often, he gives contrasting views of Native characters to emphasize their potential for good, or conversely, their proclivity for mayhem. &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; includes both the character of Magua, who fearing the extinction of his race at the hands of the whites savagely betrays them, as well as Chingachgook, the last chief of the Mohicans, who is portrayed as Natty Bumppo&#x27;s noble, courageous, and heroic counterpart.

In 1831, Cooper was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Academician.

According to Tad Szulc, Cooper was a devotee of Poland&#x27;s causes (uprisings to regain Polish sovereignty). He organized a club in Paris to support the rebels, and brought flags of the defeated Polish rebel regiment from Warsaw to present them to the exiled leaders in Paris. With his friend the Marquis de La Fayette, he supported liberals during the regime changes in France and elsewhere in the 1830s.

Though some scholars have hesitated to classify Cooper as a strict Romantic, Victor Hugo pronounced him &quot;the greatest novelist of the century&quot; outside France. Honoré de Balzac, while mocking a few of Cooper&#x27;s novels (&quot;rhapsodies&quot;) and expressing reservations about his portrayal of characters, enthusiastically called &quot;The Pathfinder&quot; a masterpiece and professed great admiration for Cooper&#x27;s portrayal of nature, only equalled in his view by Walter Scott. Mark Twain, the ultimate Realist, criticized the Romantic plots and overwrought language of &quot;The Deerslayer&quot; and &quot;The Pathfinder&quot; in his satirical but shrewdly observant essay, &quot;Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s Literary Offenses&quot; (1895).

Cooper was also criticized heavily in his day for his depiction of women characters in his work. James Russell Lowell, Cooper&#x27;s contemporary and a critic, referred to it poetically in &quot;A Fable for Critics&quot;, writing, &quot;... the women he draws from one model don&#x27;t vary / All sappy as maples and flat as a prairie.&quot;

Cooper&#x27;s lasting reputation today rests largely upon the five &quot;Leatherstocking Tales&quot;. In his 1960 study focusing on romantic relationships, both hetero- and homo-sexual, literary scholar Leslie Fiedler opines that with the exception of the five Natty Bumppo-Chingachgook novels, Cooper&#x27;s &quot;collected works are monumental in their cumulative dullness.&quot; More recent criticism views all thirty-two novels in the context of Cooper&#x27;s responding to changing political, social, and economic realities in his time period.

Cooper was honored on a U.S. commemorative stamp, the &quot;Famous American&quot; series, issued in 1940.

Cooper appears briefly as a character in Anya Seton&#x27;s 1944 historical romance &quot;Dragonwyck&quot;.

Three dining halls at the State University of New York at Oswego are named in Cooper&#x27;s remembrance (Cooper Hall, The Pathfinder, and Littlepage) because of his temporary residence in Oswego and for setting some of his works there.

Cooper Park in Michigan&#x27;s Comstock Township is named after him.

The New Jersey Turnpike has a James Fenimore Cooper service area, recognizing his birth in the state.

The gilded and red tole chandelier hanging in the library of the White House in Washington DC is from the family of James Fenimore Cooper. It was brought there through the efforts of First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy in her great White House restoration. The James Fenimore Cooper Memorial Prize at New York University is awarded annually to an outstanding undergraduate student of journalism.

In 2013, Cooper was inducted into the New York Writers Hall of Fame.

Cooper&#x27;s novels were very popular in the rest of the world, including, for instance, Russia. In particular, great interest of the Russian public in Cooper&#x27;s work was primarily incited by the novel &quot;The Pathfinder&quot;, which the Russian literary critic Vissarion Belinsky declared to be &quot;a Shakespearean drama in the form of a novel&quot;. The author was more recognizable by his middle name, Fenimore, exotic to many in Russia. This name became a symbol of exciting adventures among Russian readers. For example, in the 1977 Soviet movie &quot;The Secret of Fenimore&quot; (), being the third part of a children&#x27;s television miniseries &quot;Three Cheerful Shifts&quot; (), tells of a mysterious stranger known as &quot;Fenimore&quot;, visiting a boys&#x27; dorm in a summer camp nightly and relating fascinating stories about Indians and extraterrestrials.

<doc id="205815" wikidata="Q1443070" url="?curid=205815" title="Spider Robinson">
<text>Spider Robinson (born November 24, 1948) is an American-born Canadian science fiction author. He has won a number of awards for his hard science fiction and humorous stories, including the Hugo Award 1977 and 1983, and another Hugo with his co-author and wife Jeanne Robinson in 1978.

== Early life and education ==
Robinson was born in the Bronx, New York City; his father was a salesman. He was an avid reader of science fiction, and it was his early childhood exposure to the juvenile novels of Robert A. Heinlein that later influenced him to become a writer. He attended a Catholic high school, spending his junior year in a seminary; this was followed by two years in a Catholic college, and five years at the State University of New York at Stony Brook in the 1960s, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in English. While at Stony Brook, Spider entertained at campus coffeehouses and gatherings, strumming his guitar and singing in harmony with his female partner. It was at this time that his friends, at his request, stopped calling him his childhood nickname of &quot;Robbie&quot; (a simple contraction of his last name, Robinson) and gave him the nickname &quot;Spider&quot;, which he eventually adopted as his official first name. Robinson adopted the name partially out of admiration for blues musician &quot;Spider&quot; John Koerner.

== Career ==
In 1971, just out of college, Robinson took a night job guarding sewers in New York City, and wanting a career change, began writing science fiction. He made his first short-story sale in 1972 to &quot;Analog Science Fiction&quot; magazine. The story, &quot;The Guy with the Eyes&quot; (&quot;Analog&quot;, February 1973), was set in a bar called Callahan&#x27;s Place; Robinson would, off-and-on, continue to write stories about the denizens of Callahan&#x27;s into the 21st century. The stories have been collected into a number of published books.

In 1973, Robinson moved to Nova Scotia and began writing full-time. He made several short-story sales to &quot;Analog&quot;, &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; magazine, and others, earning the John Campbell Award for best new writer in 1974.

In 1975, he married Jeanne Robinson, a choreographer, dancer, and Sōtō Zen monk, with whom he later co-wrote the Stardance Trilogy.

He worked as a book reviewer for &quot;Galaxy&quot; magazine during the mid-to-late 1970s. In 1978–79, he contributed book reviews to Jim Baen&#x27;s original anthology series &quot;Destinies&quot;. For several years after he reviewed books for &quot;Analog&quot;, including reviews of Heinlein&#x27;s later work.

Robinson&#x27;s first published novel, &quot;Telempath&quot; (1976), was an expansion of his Hugo Award–winning novella &quot;By Any Other Name&quot;. Over the following three decades, Robinson on average released a book a year, including short story anthologies.

In 1977, Robinson released &quot;Callahan&#x27;s Crosstime Saloon&quot;, a collection of short stories in his long-running Callahan&#x27;s series. These stories, and later novels, make frequent reference to the works of mystery writer John D. MacDonald; his character Lady Sally McGee reflects Travis McGee, the central character in MacDonald&#x27;s mystery novels. The lead character in &quot;Lady Slings the Booze&quot; frequently refers to Travis McGee as a role model. In &quot;Callahan&#x27;s Key&quot; the patrons make a visit to the marina near Fort Lauderdale where the &quot;Busted Flush&quot; was usually moored in the McGee series. Similarly important to Robinson is writer Donald E. Westlake and Westlake&#x27;s most famous character, John Dortmunder.

In 1992, Robinson was master-of-ceremonies for the Hugo Awards at MagiCon, the World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon) in Orlando, Florida. From 1996 to 2005, he served as a columnist in the op-ed section (and briefly in the technology section) of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;.

In 2004, Robinson began working on a seven-page 1955 novel outline by the late Robert A. Heinlein to expand it into a novel. The book, titled &quot;Variable Star&quot;, was released on September 19, 2006. Robinson had previously written of his admiration for Heinlein in his 1980 essay &quot;Rah, Rah, R.A.H.!&quot;, in the 1998 &quot;Mentors&quot;, and in his book &quot;The Free Lunch&quot;. In an afterword to &quot;Variable Star&quot;, he recounts the story of how reading &quot;Rocket Ship Galileo&quot;, and soon after, Heinlein&#x27;s other Heinlein juvenile novels, helped set the direction for his life, and how he came to write the novel. The novel reflects the very different writing styles of both Heinlein and Robinson; reviews of the books were mixed, praising Robinson&#x27;s handling of a difficult task and the lively story, but criticizing the unlikely plot twists and trite romantic scenes.

== Personal life ==

Robinson has resided in Canada for nearly 40 years, primarily in the provinces of Nova Scotia and British Columbia. He and his wife Jeanne had a daughter, Terri Luanna da Silva, who once worked for Martha Stewart, and one granddaughter.

After living in Vancouver for a decade, he moved to Bowen Island in about 1999. He became a Canadian citizen in 2002, retaining his American citizenship. Jeanne underwent treatment for biliary cancer, and died May 30, 2010. Their daughter Terri died of breast cancer on December 5, 2014.

Robinson suffered a heart attack on August 31, 2013, but recovered. Due to the health issues faced by both himself and his family, he has not published a novel since 2008. In 2013, Robinson reported on his website that work on his next book &quot;Orphan Stars&quot; was progressing, albeit slowly. Concurrently, he has begun work on his autobiography.

He was named a Guest of Honor at the 76th World Science Fiction Convention in 2018.

<text>Legalization is the process of removing a legal prohibition against something which is currently not legal.

Legalization is a process often applied to what are regarded, by those working towards legalization, as victimless crimes, of which one example is the consumption of illegal drugs (see drug legalization).

Legalization should be contrasted with decriminalization, which removes criminal charges from an action, whereas legalization also adds in regulation, such as a minimum age to legally purchase, poses and use a drug like cannabis.

Proponents of libertarianism support legalization of what they regard as victimless crimes, such as recreational drug and alcohol use, gun ownership, and prostitution.

In U. S. immigration context, the term &quot;legalization&quot; is colloquially used to refer to a process whereby a person illegally present in the country can obtain lawful permanent residence. Since 1929, the US law has provided the legalization procedure known as registry, which simply requires the applicant to prove that he has continuously resided in the country since before a certain specified &quot;registry date&quot; (originally, 1921; presently, 1972), and is not inadmissible on other grounds (criminal history, &quot;etc.&quot;). One legalization proposal that was widely discussed recently was the DREAM Act.

<doc id="205819" wikidata="Q297193" url="?curid=205819" title="AS-90">
<text>The AS-90 (&quot;Artillery System for the 1990s&quot;), known officially as Gun Equipment 155 mm L131, is an armoured self-propelled artillery used by the British Army.

It can fire standard charges up to using 39-calibre long barrel and with 52-calibre long barrel. The maximum rate of fire is 3 rounds in 10 seconds (burst); 6 per minute for 3 minutes (intense); and 2 per minute for 60 minutes (sustained).

==History==

AS-90 was designed and built by the armaments division of Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering (VSEL). Between 1992 and 1995, VSEL supplied 179 vehicles at a cost of £300 million ($480 million). The AS-90 was first deployed by the British Army in 1993. The AS-90s were acquired to re-equip six of the eight self-propelled field artillery regiments (each of 24 guns) in the I (BR) Corps, replacing the 105 mm FV433 Abbot and older M109 155 mm Self Propelled Gun and FH70 towed howitzer. In 1999, VSEL became a part of BAE Systems.

In 1999, Marconi Electronic Systems was contracted to upgrade British Army AS-90s to include a 52 calibre gun in order to increase the range of the artillery. Critical to the programme was a bi-modular charge system from Somchem of South Africa (selected after extensive trials of ammunition from many suppliers), which offered greatly reduced barrel wear. However, this ammunition failed to meet the requirement for insensitive munitions and the project was terminated.

It remains in UK service and equips three field regiments supporting armoured infantry brigades for the foreseeable future. In 2008, there were 134 AS-90 in service further reduced to 117 by 2015. In 2008 and 2009, a capability enhancement programme primarily upgraded AS-90&#x27;s electronic system.

The initial expected out-of-service date for the AS-90 had been 2030, but this was later delayed to 2032 with a replacement planned to enter service in 2029.

On 24 April 2022, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; reported that AS-90s and 45,000 artillery rounds would be sent to Ukraine but that was subsequently denied by Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. On 14 January 2023, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that Britain would send 30 AS-90 to Ukraine, amongst other supplies (including 14 Challenger 2 tanks), for use in the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War.

To fill the gap in British Army artillery left by the donation, the UK government announced they were buying 14 Archer Artillery Systems in March 2023. The deal was negotiated in just eight weeks as part of the Urgent Operational Requirement procurement process; the first vehicles are to be fully operational by April 2024. The purchase will fill a hole in capabilities until a new system is decided upon as part of the Mobile Fires Platform program, where Archer was a competitor. On April 23, 2024 the UK government announced that the AS-90 would be replaced by the RCH 155.

==Development==
AS-90 started in the mid-1980s as a private venture on the gamble that the tri-national SP70 would fail. When this did occur, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) issued a cardinal point specification on one page for a new 155 mm self-propelled gun. The MoD was also required to consider the US &quot;Paladin&quot;, an upgraded M109 howitzer. The MoD undertook studies in 2006–09 to &quot;up-gun&quot; the Royal Navy&#x27;s main shipboard gun armament, the 4.5 inch Mark 8 naval gun, to accept 155mm ammunition from the AS-90. This would have introduced a common gun calibre for the British Army and Royal Navy, helping with ammunition logistics, and encouraging joint Army-Navy development of extended-range and precision-guided shells. The development of this gun for the Royal Navy was stopped due to budget cuts in the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010.

==Design==

In 1963 certain NATO nations, including the UK, agreed to a &quot;Ballistics Memorandum of Understanding&quot; for a 155 mm 39 calibre ordnance and a baseline projectile with the shape used for the US M549 rocket-assisted shell. The AS-90 uses a conforming 39 calibre barrel which fires the L15 unassisted projectile out to a range of . However, this was a new design of ordnance using a split sliding block breech with Crossley obturation, instead of the more usual screw breech, to permit bagged charges (no metal cartridge cases). The breech mechanism has a primer magazine holding 18 primers. The standard ammunition is that designed for FH-70 (L15 HE and associated propelling charges) although in training the less effective but cheaper M107 with Green and White propelling charges is used.

It is fitted with an auxiliary power unit to eliminate the need to run the main engine to keep the batteries charged while stationary; electrical servos drive the automated elevation, traverse, magazine, shell transfer arm and loader as well as power for electronics and communications.

The vehicle is fitted with an autonomous navigation and gun laying dynamic reference unit (DRU) mounted on the trunnion. All main turret functions are controlled by a Turret Control Computer (TCC) with control and display units for the No 1 (Detachment Commander), No 2 (loader) and No 3 (layer). The combination of the DRU, TCC and powered laying controls provide autolaying. Every gun is fitted with a radar Muzzle Velocity Measuring Device. Reversionary mode laying uses deflection laying via the direct fire sight.

The gun can be brought into action fully closed down; the barrel can be clamped and unclamped from within the vehicle. In-to and out-of action times are less than one minute.

The gun is compatible with the extended-range guided projectile M982 Excalibur.

==Combat history==

The AS90 was deployed in Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s to support NATO peacekeeping efforts during the Yugoslav Wars. 32 AS90s were also deployed during the 2003 Iraq War. Speaking of their capability, Commander of the British land component, General Brims, commented that &quot;the phenomenal accuracy of it, [was] way beyond anything that one might have expected&quot;. AS90s were used to shell Iraqi mortar positions during the Battle of Basra, one of the opening battles of the conflict. In October 2023, Defence Minister Adam Ingram stated it had a 92% availability rate during the war.

=== Ukraine ===
A total of 20 battle-ready AS90s and 12 non-functional spares were donated to Ukraine by the UK in 2023 during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with first combat usage in June 2023. According to Ukrainian forces, the AS90 outperforms their existing Soviet-era artillery systems, such as the 2S1 Gvozdika and 2S3 Akatsiya, in both range and accuracy.
In July 2024, the UK Ministry of Defence announced a new package of support for Ukraine including 10 AS90s and support for previously gifted ones.

As of March 2025, the pro Western Oryx blog recorded Ukrainian losses at 14 units (9 destroyed and 5 damaged).

<text>The Battle of Balaclava, fought on 25 October 1854 during the Crimean War, was part of the Siege of Sevastopol (1854–55), an Allied attempt to capture the port and fortress of Sevastopol, Russia&#x27;s principal naval base on the Black Sea. The engagement followed the earlier Allied victory in September at the Battle of the Alma, where the Russian General Menshikov had positioned his army in an attempt to stop the Allies progressing south towards their strategic goal. Alma was the first major encounter fought in the Crimean Peninsula since the Allied landings at Kalamita Bay on 14 September, and was a clear battlefield success; but a tardy pursuit by the Allies failed to gain a decisive victory, allowing the Russians to regroup, recover and prepare their defence.

The Russians split their forces. Defending within the allied siege lines was primarily the Navy manning the considerable static defenses of the city and threatening the allies from without was the mobile Army under General Menshikov.

The Allies decided against a fast assault on Sevastopol and instead prepared for a protracted siege. The British, under the command of Lord Raglan, and the French, under Canrobert, positioned their troops to the south of the port on the Chersonese Peninsula: the French Army occupied the bay of Kamiesch on the west coast whilst the British moved to the southern port of Balaclava. However, this position committed the British to the defence of the right flank of the Allied siege operations, for which Raglan had insufficient troops. Taking advantage of this exposure, the Russian General Liprandi, with some 25,000 men, prepared to attack the defences around Balaclava, hoping to disrupt the supply chain between the British base and their siege lines.

The battle began with a Russian artillery and infantry attack on the Ottoman redoubts that formed Balaclava&#x27;s first line of defence on the Vorontsov Heights. The Ottoman forces initially resisted the Russian assaults, but lacking support they were eventually forced to retreat. When the redoubts fell, the Russian cavalry moved to engage the second defensive line in the South Valley, held by the Ottoman and the British 93rd Highland Regiment in what came to be known as the &quot;Thin Red Line&quot;. This line held and repelled the attack; as did General James Scarlett&#x27;s British Heavy Brigade which charged and defeated the greater proportion of the cavalry advance, forcing the Russians onto the defensive. However, a final Allied cavalry charge, stemming from a misinterpreted order from Raglan, led to one of the most famous and ill-fated events in British military history – the Charge of the Light Brigade. French troops who came to the aid of the allies tried to recapture the redoubts, however, unsuccessfully, but this showed the Russians that they would not be able to achieve at least some further success other than holding the already captured positions.

==Prelude==
===On to Sevastopol===

The British and French fleets departed from the Bulgarian port of Varna on 5 September 1854, heading towards Kalamita Bay in the Crimea. By the 14th, the troops began to land; within four days the Allied force of 61,400 infantry, 1,200 cavalry and 137 guns, was ashore. Thirty-three miles (~53 km) to the south of the landing zone, beyond the Bulganak, lma, Katcha and Belbek rivers, lay the Russian naval base and fortress of Sevastopol, the key Allied objective in the Crimea. General Menshikov, aware of the Allied presence, prepared his troops on the banks of the River Alma in an effort to halt the Franco-British advance, but on 20 September he was soundly defeated in what was the first major battle in the Crimea. News of Menshikov&#x27;s defeat was met with disbelief by Tsar Nicholas I in St. Petersburg – it seemed it would only be a matter of time before Sevastopol fell.

Allied hesitation, first from the French commander-in-chief, Saint-Arnaud, then by Lord Raglan, allowed the dispirited Russians to escape the battlefield in relative order, allowing Menshikov and his army to reach Sevastopol, reorganise and rebuild their morale. &quot;It is frightful to think what might have happened&quot;, wrote Vice-Admiral Kornilov, &quot;had it not been for this cardinal error of the enemy&#x27;s.&quot;

The Allied march south finally recommenced on the morning of 23 September 1854, but there was as yet no definite plan of action; it was not until they had passed the River Katcha in sight of Sevastopol itself, that the Allied commanders discussed their options. The original plan had envisaged a move across the River Belbek before attacking the north side (the Severnaya) of Sevastopol harbour, defended by the Star Fort; but recent naval intelligence had revealed that the position was much stronger than had first been realised. John Burgoyne, the British Army&#x27;s most experienced engineer, advocated an attack on Sevastopol from the south which, from all reports, was still an imperfectly entrenched position. This was a view shared by Saint-Arnaud who, having received his own intelligence of Russian reinforcements, had refused to agree to an attack from the north. Burgoyne&#x27;s proposed &#x27;flank march&#x27; required the Allies to go round the city to the east in order to attack the harbour from the south where the defences were weakest. Raglan was inclined to agree, arguing that he had always been disposed to such an operation; he knew, too, that the problem of re-supply would be eased with the seizing of the southern ports on the Chersonese Peninsula.

On 24 September, Menshikov began to move his army out of Sevastopol towards Bakchi Serai and Simferopol, leaving Admirals Kornilov and Nakhimov to organise the 18,000-strong garrison (mainly sailors and marines) and prepare the port&#x27;s defences.

By venturing into the interior of the Crimea, Menshikov would not only keep open his communications with Russia, but would also be in touch with reinforcements from Odessa or Kertch; moreover, he would be free to operate in the field and threaten the Allied flank. Whilst Menshikov moved east, the Anglo-French-Turkish army, with the British in the vanguard, continued its march towards the southern coast of the peninsula. The heat was oppressive, the water sparse, and cholera rife, taking a heavy toll on the men including Saint-Arnaud who was already ill with cancer. The march had been a real trial and was not without incident. At one point, on 25 September near MacKenzie&#x27;s Farm, Raglan and his staff in front of the British column stumbled across the rear of the retreating Russians; with the rest of his army strung out behind in hopeless disorder, Menshikov missed a chance to inflict a major reverse on the British. By the 26th, however, Raglan had reached the village of Kadikoi, and was able to look down on the narrow inlet of Balaclava. That same day Saint-Arnaud, now critically ill, surrendered his command to General Canrobert.

===Opposing forces===
===Allied deployment===
The harbor at Balaclava was too small for both Allied armies to use. By rights, the French, who had claimed the honor of holding the right of the line, should have occupied Balaclava whilst the British should have moved west to the ports of Kazatch and Kamiesch. Canrobert offered the British the choice, but badly advised by Admiral Lyons, Raglan chose Balaclava for his base, not realizing that the two western bays offered far better facilities as supply ports. Moreover, Raglan committed the British Army to the defense of the right flank of the Allied operation and would have to ensure the security of both Anglo-French armies against the threat posed by Menshikov&#x27;s forces to the east. The decision by Raglan was a bad mistake and one for which the British Army was to pay a terrible price.

For many, the only justification for the &#x27;flank march&#x27; was an immediate assault upon Sevastopol. George Cathcart, commander of the British 4th Division, pleaded with Raglan for instant action. &quot;I am sure I could walk into it, with scarcely the loss of a man,&quot; wrote Cathcart to Raglan on 28 September from the heights above the eastern approach to the city. &quot;We could leave our packs, and run into it even in open day … We see people walking about the streets in great consternation ...&quot; But caution prevailed, and plans by Burgoyne for a formal siege, backed by Canrobert, were prepared. When Raglan told Cathcart that nothing would happen until the Allied siege trains had been landed, Cathcart could not hide his irritation, &quot;Land the siege trains! But my dear Lord Raglan, what the devil is there to knock down?&quot;

Having decided upon which port they would occupy the Allies set about deploying their forces on the Chersonese Peninsula. The peninsula is bounded to the north by Sevastopol Harbour, at the head of which the River Chernaya flows from the south-east. The eastern boundary is formed by a long escarpment, the Sapouné Heights, averaging 600 feet high, and pierced by two passes only: the metalled Worontsov road, and, at the southern end of the heights, the Col, through which ran a steeper and more difficult road leading from the west end of Sevastopol to Balaclava. Sevastopol itself was divided in two by the Dockyard Creek. Two of Canrobert&#x27;s four divisions, supervised by General Forey, were allotted the western siege operations around the city, from the Black Sea to the Dockyard Creek; the other two divisions, under General Bosquet, would act as a covering force along the Sapouné Heights. To Bosquet&#x27;s north lay the camp of the British 1st Division, and beyond this De Lacy Evans&#x27; 2nd Division guarding the extreme right of the Allied line with the Inkerman Heights to its front and the Chernaya Valley to its right.

The port of Balaclava lay outside the main Allied perimeter and had to be provided with a defensive system of its own. The Vorontsov Road ran down from the Sapouné Heights along a ridge, running east–west, known as the Causeway Heights, dividing the plain into two sections – the North Valley and the South Valley. Redoubts upon the Causeway Heights offered Balaclava its first line of defense: five were built upon the heights – approximately 500 yards (~450 m) apart – and one upon what came to be known as Canrobert&#x27;s Hill, slightly to the south and covering the extreme right of the British defenses (see map below). The redoubts housed a total of nine naval guns, all 12-pounders from HMS &quot;Diamond&quot;: three in No.1 redoubt on Canrobert&#x27;s Hill; two each in redoubts 2, 3, and 4. Redoubts 5 and 6 (the two at the western end of the Causeway Heights), were still unfinished and without any guns. These defenses were hastily constructed, but they were not small works: No.1 redoubt held a garrison of 600 Turks, whilst redoubts 2, 3, and 4 each held 300; all were accompanied by one British artillery NCO. The inner line of defense of the British base was supplied by the 93rd Highlanders and a Royal Artillery field battery stationed at the village of Kadikoi to the north of Balaclava. These were supported by Royal Marines and artillery positioned along the heights above the port, as well as additional Ottoman troops. In addition to these defenses, Raglan could call upon the 1,500 men of Lord Lucan&#x27;s Cavalry Division camped on the western end of the South Valley, along with a troop of Royal Horse Artillery. The total force available for the immediate defense of the British base at Balaclava numbered around 4,500 men, supported by 26 guns.

===Russian plan===
As the Allied siege guns bombarded Sevastopol the Russian reserves were moving to the Crimea. The Russians sought to relieve Sevastopol from bombardment by marching newly arrived reinforcements from the Danubian front. This force of Russian reinforcements would strike at the allies&#x27; main port of supply—Balaclava. At the forefront of these reinforcements was the 12th Infantry Division – part of the Russian 4th Corps – under General Pavel Liprandi. This division, consisting of the Azovsky, Dnieper, Ukraine and Odessa regiments, along with four batteries of artillery, had arrived from Bessarabia; by the time the division had reached the Crimea, Menshikov had decided on the plan to use them to attack the Allied rear from Chorgun, and march on Balaclava.

The vulnerability of Balaclava was well known to both sides. Undertaking the siege operations around Sevastopol whilst securing the Allies&#x27; eastern flank was stretching the resources of Raglan&#x27;s dwindling forces – British casualties at the Alma had been high, and many were still suffering from the cholera epidemic; others simply fell sick from exhaustion. With the arrival of further Russian reinforcements, Menshikov&#x27;s total force in theatre (including 12 Division) numbered around 65,000. The remainder of 4th Corps – 10 and 11 Divisions – were also heading towards the Crimea, but Menshikov, under pressure from Nicholas I to strike back at the Allies, decided not to wait for these troops before beginning the attack.

The first move by the Russians came on the early morning of 18 October 1854, when Lieutenant Colonel Rakovitch moved against the village of Chorgun with three infantry battalions, 200 Cossacks and four guns. From here, Liprandi, Rakovitch and Major General Semyakin were able to reconnoitre the Allied redoubts along the Causeway Heights. To the Russian commanders, and, belatedly, to the Royal Engineers, the redoubts were recognised to be too far forward of the inner defensive line of Balaclava to be adequately defended and supported by the British. Russian reconnaissance reports had also indicated that these outer defences were occupied by a mixture of Tunisians, raw recruits and militia, and not of the same calibre of men that had defeated them on the Danube at the beginning of the war. To Liprandi and his generals it seemed a swift strike against the redoubts was certain of success.

By 23 October Liprandi had gathered 16,000 men, known as the &#x27;Detachment of Chorgun&#x27;, comprising 17 battalions, 30 squadrons and 64 guns. The left column, commanded by Major General Gribbe, was to advance across the Chernaya River and towards the village of Kamara. The centre column, under Major General Semyakin, was divided into two wings: Semyakin himself, commanding the left wing, was to lead his troops south from Chorgun before moving against Canrobert&#x27;s Hill and No.1 redoubt; Major General Levutsky, commanding the right wing of the centre column, was tasked to assault No.2 redoubt farther to the west. Meanwhile, the right column, under Colonel Skyuderi, was to advance across the Chernaya via the Tractir Bridge before moving south through the Fedyukhin Heights and across the North Valley to attack No.3 redoubt. The attacks were to be supported by Lieutenant General Ryzhov&#x27;s cavalry. A further force, numbering 4,500 men and 14 guns under Major General Zhabokritsky, protected Liprandi&#x27;s right from Allied interference. Once the redoubts had been captured, Zhabokritsky was to occupy the Fedioukine Heights. In total (including Zhabokritsky&#x27;s force and a reserve held back at the Tractir Bridge) Liprandi had at his disposal around 25,000 men and 78 guns – not enough to threaten the siege lines, but more than enough to compromise the defences at Balaclava whose loss to the Allies would be tremendous. (See map below).

==Battle==
Recent intelligence received by the British had indicated a major Russian attack was imminent. After a considerable number of false alarms the previous week, however, Raglan failed to act, believing that they were needlessly exhausting his men who were turned out on every report. But this latest intelligence proved accurate, and early on 25 October, just before 05:00, Liprandi&#x27;s troops of the &#x27;Chorgun Detachment&#x27; left their camp and marched off in silence towards the Balaclava valleys.

The village of Kamara was the most easterly picket for Allied soldiers, providing a useful observation point for Lucan&#x27;s vedettes. In the dark dawn, a squadron of Russian Cossacks, followed by a host of uhlans, rode slowly towards the village. These troops were the leading elements of Gribbe&#x27;s force. First to discover that the Russians had moved up under cover of dark was the duty field officer of the day, Captain Alexander Low of the 4th Light Dragoons. The picket in Kamara had not seen the advancing Cossacks (there is some suggestion that they were sleeping), and it was only through Low&#x27;s timely arrival and his shouts that they managed to escape and make their way to the nearest redoubt on the Causeway Heights. Behind the Cossacks and uhlans came the Dnieper Regiment along with the artillery. Immediately, Gribbe positioned his ten guns on the slopes to the west of Kamara, leaving his gunners with a clear view of No.1 redoubt on Canrobert&#x27;s Hill.

In accordance with his usual practice Lucan had gone forward at daybreak to inspect the redoubts and outposts, accompanied by his staff: Lord George Paget, Lord William Paulet, and Major Thomas McMahon. As they approached Canrobert&#x27;s Hill, two signal flags were observed, signifying the approach of the Russians. Paget, commanding officer of the 4th Light Dragoons (and commanding officer of the Light Brigade in Cardigan&#x27;s absence), later recalled the moment when they realized something was wrong:

&quot;Hello,&quot; said Lord William, &quot;there are two flags flying; what does it mean?&quot; &quot;Why, that surely is the signal that the enemy is approaching,&quot; said Major McMahon. &quot;Are you quite sure?&quot; we replied. Hardly were the words out of McMahon&#x27;s mouth, when bang went a cannon from the redoubt in question, fired on the advancing masses of the enemy.

===Redoubts===

The Ottoman guns from No.1 redoubt on Canrobert&#x27;s hill fired on the Russians at around 06:00 – the Battle of Balaclava had begun. Lucan despatched Captain Charteris to inform Raglan that the redoubts were under attack. Charteris arrived at around 07:00, but those at the British headquarters had already heard the sound of the guns. Lucan himself rode quickly back towards Kadikoi to confer with Sir Colin Campbell, commander of the Balaclava defences. The two men agreed that this was not another Russian feint, but an attack in force with the intention of taking the British base. Campbell prepared his 93rd Highlanders to meet the enemy, whilst Lucan returned to the cavalry. Leaving the Light Brigade where it stood, Lucan led the Heavy Brigade towards the redoubts, hoping his presence might discourage any further Russian advance on Balaclava. Realizing his show of strength had little impact, however, Lucan led the Heavies back to their original position alongside the Light Brigade. The Ottoman forces were left to face the full force of the Russian assault almost alone.

While Gribbe&#x27;s artillery continued to shell No.1 redoubt, the Russian columns under Levutsky, Semyakin, and Skyuderi began to move into the North Valley. Although the Heavy Brigade had pulled back, the British did send forward their available artillery to assist the Ottoman forces on the Causeway Heights. Captain George Maude&#x27;s troop of horse artillery, I Troop, unlimbered its four 6-pounder and two 12-pounder guns between redoubts 2 and 3, whilst Captain Barker&#x27;s battery, W Battery, of the Royal Artillery, moved out of Balaclava and took its position on Maude&#x27;s left. However, the artillery duel was a very one sided affair. The heavier Russian guns (some 18-pounders), particularly No.4 battery under Lieutenant Postikov, together with the riflemen of the Ukraine regiment, took their toll on both men and ordnance. Running short of ammunition and taking hits, Maude&#x27;s troop was forced to retire (Maude himself was severely wounded). Their place taken by two guns from Barker&#x27;s battery. As the British artillery fire slackened, Semyakin prepared to storm No. 1 redoubt, personally leading the assault together with three battalions of the Azovsky Regiment under Colonel Krudener. &quot;I waved my hat on both sides,&quot; recalled Semyakin. &quot;Everybody rushed after me and I was protected by the stern Azovs.&quot; The Ottoman forces on Canrobert&#x27;s Hill resisted stubbornly. Although the attack had begun at 06:00, it was not until 07:30 when No.1 redoubt fell. During that time the 600 Ottoman defenders had suffered from the heavy artillery bombardment; in the ensuing fight in the redoubt and subsequent pursuit by the Cossacks, an estimated 170 Ottomans were killed. In his first report of the action for &quot;The Times&quot;, William Russell wrote that the Turks &#x27;received a few shots and then bolted&#x27;, but afterwards admitted that he had not been a witness to the start of the battle, confessing, &#x27;Our treatment of the Turks was unfair ... ignorant as we were that the Turkish in No.1 redoubt lost more than a fourth of their number ere they abandoned it to the enemy&#x27;. Later Lucan and Campbell too acknowledged the firmness with which the assault on No 1 redoubt, which was not visible from their vantage point, had been resisted; it was not until this had been overwhelmed did the defenders abandon redoubts 2, 3 and 4. Of the estimated 2,500 Russians who took part in the assault the Azovsky Regiment lost two officers and 149 men killed.

The remaining redoubts were now in danger of falling into the hands of the oncoming Russians. The battalions of the Ukraine Regiment under Colonel Dudnitsky-Lishin, attacked redoubts Nos.2 and 3, while the Odessa Regiment under Skyuderi advanced on redoubt No.4. The Ottoman forces in these positions, having already watched their compatriots flee the first redoubt and realizing that the British were not coming to their aid, retreated towards Balaclava, pursued by the Cossacks who had little trouble dispatching any stray or isolated men. The few British NCOs could do nothing but spike the guns, rendering them unusable. The Ottoman forces had gained some time for the Allies, but in the end the Turks were forced to abandon the redoubts. By 08:00 the Russians had occupied redoubts 1, 2 and 3, and, considering it too close to the enemy, had razed redoubt No.4.

===South Valley===
Canrobert had been informed of the Russian attack at about 07:30, and had immediately ridden off to join Raglan. Bosquet, having been aroused by the sound of the cannon, had ordered the 2nd Brigade of the French 1st Division (under General Vinoy) to march towards Balaclava in support of the British. Additionally, the 1st Brigade under General Espinasse began to move, along with the divisional artillery and the Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique. The French 3rd Division was put on alert, and the horse artillery of the reserve harnessed. Raglan had at first thought the Russian advance a feint, possibly designed to occupy him whilst the enemy stormed out of Sevastopol to attack his army overlooking the heights above the city; but now he saw that he had been wrong. With the first four redoubts on the Causeway Heights either captured or out of action, all that protected Balaclava were Lucan&#x27;s Cavalry Division, together with the 550 men of the 93 Highlanders, Barker&#x27;s W Battery, 100 invalids under Colonel Daveney, and some Ottomans, reinforced by their countrymen from the redoubts who had rallied and formed up alongside them. It was only now that Raglan ordered the British 1st Division under the Duke of Cambridge, and Cathcart&#x27;s 4th Division, to move into the plain. The 1st Division got away promptly, but when Raglan&#x27;s staff officer informed Cathcart that the Russians were marching on Balaclava, he at first refused to comply, complaining that his men had only just finished their shift in the trenches before Sevastopol. In the end he did move, but the delay brought his division down 40 minutes after the Duke&#x27;s. It would take a least two hours to march an infantry division down from the heights overlooking Sevastopol into the plain of Balaclava. The Russians appeared to have the intentions and the means to capture the British base in a much shorter time.

At approximately 07:45, the commander of the Light Brigade, Lord Cardigan, reached his cavalry, having arrived from his yacht moored in Balaclava harbour. Raglan, meanwhile, had taken up his position on the Sapouné Heights, 650 feet (~200 m) above the plain. Unwilling at this point to risk his cavalry without infantry support (as he had done throughout the whole campaign), Raglan issued his first order to the Cavalry Division at 08:00 – &quot;Cavalry to take ground to the left of the second line of redoubts occupied by the Turks&quot;. The order was ambiguous and misleading (there was no &#x27;second line of redoubts&#x27; and the word &#x27;left&#x27; is dependent on the perspective of the viewer), but on this occasion Lucan had interpreted the order correctly, and moved his cavalry to the west, placing them between No. 6 redoubt and the foot of the Sapouné Heights where they could not be seen by, or engage with, the Russians. The new position placed the Light Brigade near, but to one side, of the mouth of the North Valley; the Heavy Brigade sat on their right. However, 30 minutes after issuing his first order, Raglan now changed his mind and issued his second order at 08:30 – &quot;Eight squadrons of heavy Dragoons to be detached towards Balaclava to support the Turks who are wavering&quot;. There was no evidence that the Turks formed up alongside the Highlanders were wavering, but Raglan thought they were, or might soon do so. As each regiment comprised two squadrons, Lucan, with growing frustration, was required to move four of his five Heavy Brigade regiments back onto the open plain and the defensive line of Kadikoi. Although this order meant he had to divide his cavalry – thus reducing the effectiveness of each part – Lucan complied, and ordered General Scarlett to lead four regiments back to where they had just come from.

====Ryzhov&#x27;s advance====
Liprandi now brought forward Ryzhov&#x27;s cavalry to press home his advantage. Ryzhov&#x27;s force consisted of eight squadrons of the 11th Kiev Hussars, six of the 12th Ingermanland Hussars, three of the 53rd Don Cossack Regiment, and the 1st Ural Cossacks, totalling between 2,000 and 3,000 men (sources vary), and 16 guns. The Russian cavalry crossed in a south-westerly direction across the Chernaya river and, at about 09:00, streamed into the North Valley. When level with the empty No.4 redoubt, Ryzhov wheeled to the left, crested the Causeway Heights, and came to a halt; before him, he could see the Heavy Brigade moving east across his front, while away to the south he could discern the Highlanders and Turks immediately to the north of Kadikoi. Ryzhov detached 400 men of the Ingermanland Hussars to turn and head straight for the Allied infantry position. Sir Colin Campbell, commander of the Highland Brigade and thus the 93rd Highlanders, brought his men forward from behind the hillock that had sheltered them from the Russian artillery. With only Balaclava and the Black Sea to their backs, he rode quickly along the line expressing his determination to resist – &quot;Men, remember there is no retreat from here. You must die where you stand.&quot; Campbell&#x27;s aide, John Scott, replied &quot;Aye Sir Colin. Needs be we&#x27;ll do that.&quot; Campbell had such a poor opinion of the Russian cavalry that he did not bother telling his men to form square; instead, he lined them up in the normal two-deep firing line. Raglan on the Sapouné Heights had a grandstand view, as did William Russell, who wrote furiously in his notebook:

The Russians dash at the Highlanders. The ground flies beneath their horses&#x27; feet; gathering speed at every stride, they dash on towards that thin red streak topped with a line of steel.

The British delivered their first volley at long range and failed to fell a single Russian. A second volley thundered, supported by fire from guns of Barker&#x27;s battery and those of the Marines. This caused the Russians to swerve to their left, which Campbell took as an attempt to turn his right. He sternly checked an inclination to charge with the bayonet, and instead threw forward the 93rd&#x27;s right-hand, grenadier company, under Captain Ross. This delivered a third volley which decided the issue. Barely five minutes after it had begun the Ingermanland Hussars were in retreat, and heading towards the Causeway Heights: the Russian commander of the brigade had reasoned that such a small, unsquared line of British infantry could not hope to hold out a cavalry charge, therefore there must be a larger force behind them. It was not until later accounts that Russell&#x27;s &#x27;thin red streak&#x27; became the famous &#x27;Thin Red Line&#x27;.

Meanwhile, the main part of Ryzhov&#x27;s cavalry remained static on the southern slopes of the Causeway Heights, some 800 yards (~730 m) from Scarlett&#x27;s Heavy Brigade still moving south-east in the South Valley. The eight squadrons of the Heavy Brigade consisted of two each from the Scots Greys, the 6th Dragoons, 4th Dragoon Guards, and the 5th Dragoon Guards; the brigade&#x27;s remaining two squadrons from the 1st Royal Dragoons were left in their original position to the west of No.6 redoubt. Although outnumbering the British by two or three to one and having the advantage of the high ground, the Russians seemed shaken by the unexpected presence of Scarlett&#x27;s cavalry.

Scarlett, notoriously short-sighted, remained unaware that the Russians were there. However, once he had negotiated a vineyard and the sprawling tented camp of the Light Brigade, he was notified by his ADC, Lieutenant Elliot, of the proximity of the Russian cavalry on their left flank. Scarlett gave the order &#x27;Left wheel into line&#x27; which turned the two advanced regiments into line to face the enemy; these were shortly followed by the other two regiments forming a second line. Had the Russians charged at this moment they would have caught Scarlett&#x27;s men completely disorganised, yet Ryzhov let the chance slip. Lucan, who had also seen the Russians, rode across with his staff from the Light Brigade to join the Heavies. So impatient was he to attack that he ordered his duty trumpeter, Trumpet Major Joy, to sound the charge – but nothing happened. An attempt to attack before his men were in perfect alignment was contrary to every precept that the officers had learnt back in England, and it was only when the dressing had been completed to his satisfaction did Scarlett order &quot;his&quot; trumpeter, Trumpet Major Monks, to sound the charge. The Heavy Brigade began to move against the Russian cavalrymen.

====Charge of the Heavy Brigade====
The charge of the Heavy Brigade was anything but a charge – the brigade had launched uphill from a standing start, and the short distance between the two combatants had hardly allowed their horses to reach the trot. Moreover, the Russians were at last moving to meet them. Scarlett was first into Ryzhov&#x27;s cavalry, closely followed by his staff, and, initially, just three squadrons – two of the Scots Greys on the left, and one of the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons on the right, totalling 300 men. The first to feel the force of the British attack were the Ingermanland Hussars, under the command of Major General Khaletsky. Staff-captain Arbuzov later described how they &quot; … had to fight with the regiment of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Dragoon Guards in their red coats … Neither we nor the English wanted to yield.&quot; A British Dragoon later described the action from his own perspective – &quot;They were so superior in numbers, they outflanked us, and we were in the middle of them … I hope God will forgive me, for I felt more like a devil than a man.&quot;

Shortly, the second squadron of the Inniskillings attacked the left flank of the Russians, followed by the 5th Dragoon Guards who crashed into the Russians as they folded around the rear of the Scots Greys. Beyond them the 4th Dragoon Guards, in one unbroken line and to cries of &quot;Faugh A Ballagh&quot;, attacked the right rear of the Russian cavalry; the force of their impact was such that they were able to hack their way from one flank to the other with the loss of only one man. Finally came the Royal Dragoons who, ignoring their orders to remain behind, attacked on their own initiative, striking the right front of the Russians. Ryzhov had been caught flat-footed, allowing Scarlett&#x27;s cavalry to push ahead, heaving and hacking at their opponents from all sides before gaining the ascendancy. &quot;At length they turned and well they might,&quot; wrote Lieutenant Godman. &quot;We pursued about 300 yards, and then called off with much difficulty, the gunners opened on them, and gave them a fine peppering.&quot; These guns were from C Troop, Royal Horse Artillery under Captain Brandling, whose 9-pounders dissuaded Ryzhov&#x27;s cavalry from reforming and charging again. The Russians retreated in the direction of the Causeway Heights before halting at the east end of the North Valley.

The Charge of the Heavy Brigade had lasted no more than 10 minutes. Ryzhov&#x27;s cavalry suffered 40–50 killed and over 200 wounded; the British lost 10 killed and 98 wounded. Scarlett&#x27;s attack had been a remarkable success, yet it could have been a greater victory. When the Heavies attacked, the Earl of Cardigan&#x27;s Light Brigade was less than 500 yards (~450 m) from Ryzhov&#x27;s cavalry. The spectators on the Sapouné Heights, and the officers and men in the Light Brigade watching the Russians retreat in disorder, expected Cardigan to lead a pursuit and finish them off. Captain William Morris of the 17th Lancers urged his commander on, but Cardigan claimed he could not advance given the orders he had received from Lucan to remain in his position &#x27;and to defend it against any attack&#x27;. Lucan later gave a different version from Cardigan&#x27;s. He confirmed he had ordered Cardigan to defend his position, but maintained that his parting orders made it quite clear that he had permission to take advantage of so obvious an opportunity. Whatever the differences the Light Brigade had done nothing but look on. When Morris rode back to his regiment after confronting Cardigan, he could not hide his frustration – &quot;My God, my God, what a chance we are losing.&quot;

===North Valley===
It was approaching 09:30, and the first part of the battle was over. So far Liprandi had enjoyed mixed fortunes: although his cavalry had been repelled by Campbell&#x27;s &#x27;Thin Red Line&#x27; and Scarlett&#x27;s Heavies, his troops under Gribbe, Semyakin, Levutsky, and Skyuderi were still in possession of redoubts Nos. 1–3, and had destroyed redoubt No.4. In all, the Russians had 11 infantry battalions and 32 guns on the Causeway Heights, while to the north, on the Fedioukine Heights, Zhabokritsky had positioned eight battalions, four squadrons, and 14 guns (some sources state 10 guns). In front of Ryzhov&#x27;s cavalry – drawn up across the eastern end of the North Valley – Liprandi placed the eight guns of the 3rd Don Cossack Battery, commanded by Prince Obolensky. These guns, 6- and 9-pounders, served by 200 men, stared straight down the North Valley. Liprandi now also had at his disposal six squadrons of Lancers divided into two bodies: three squadrons on the Fedioukine Heights; three others in a ravine on the side of the Causeway Heights.

Raglan was anxious to exploit Scarlett&#x27;s success and drive the Russians off the Causeway Heights, but Cathcart&#x27;s and Cambridge&#x27;s infantry divisions had still not arrived; every minute that passed gave the Russians more time to prepare their defences for the expected British counter-attack. The British commander believed that the enemy had retreated in such disorder that a show of force by his cavalry – in advance of the infantry&#x27;s arrival – would be enough to persuade the Russians to abandon the Causeway Heights. At 10:00, therefore, he gave his third order of the day to the Cavalry Division: &quot;Cavalry to advance and take advantage of any opportunity to recover the Heights. They will be supported by infantry which have been ordered. Advance on two fronts.&quot; Raglan wished his cavalry to advance immediately, but the ambiguity of the order had again resulted in a misunderstanding. Lucan had assumed he was first to wait for the infantry before moving forward. Accordingly, he ordered the Light Brigade into the North Valley, while the Heavy Brigade held the entrance of the South Valley, perhaps in response to the order &#x27;Advance on two fronts&#x27;. Lucan believed he had complied with the order as far as he could until the infantry arrived, but Raglan looked on with growing impatience at his immobile cavalry. It was at this moment when a staff officer (identity unknown) shouted out that the Russians in the redoubts on the Causeway Heights were dragging away the captured British guns. The British infantry divisions were now only minutes away, but only the cavalry could move fast enough and prevent the loss of the guns. With growing impatience Raglan dictated to General Richard Airey the fourth and final order to Lord Lucan. This order was to be understood in conjunction with the third as an instruction to do immediately what had been previously ordered:

10:45. Lord Raglan wishes the cavalry to advance rapidly to the front – follow the enemy and try to prevent the enemy carrying away the guns – Troop Horse Artillery may accompany – French cavalry is on your left. R Airey. Immediate.

Having read the order scribbled down by Airey, Raglan summoned Captain Louis Nolan of the 15th The King&#x27;s Hussars, Airey&#x27;s hot-tempered aide-de-camp, to deliver it to Lucan. As he turned his horse to head directly down the escarpment, Raglan called after him, &quot;Tell Lord Lucan the cavalry is to attack immediately.&quot; These words sealed the fate of the Light Brigade.

====Charge of the Light Brigade====

Lucan was puzzled by Raglan&#x27;s imprecise order. There was no mention of heights – it referred instead to the front – and gone were all references to infantry. He was to try to &#x27;prevent the enemy carrying away the guns&#x27; but from his position he could not see any guns being carried away. When Lucan questioned the order an excited Nolan told him he was to attack immediately.
:&quot;Attack, sir!&quot;
:&quot;Attack what? What guns, sir?&quot;
:&quot;There, my Lord, is your enemy!&quot; said Nolan indignantly, vaguely waving his arm eastwards. &quot;There are your guns!&quot;
Nolan&#x27;s gesture was imprecise, and pointed not to the redoubts and the captured British guns but, it seemed – at least to Lucan and his staff officers present – to the Russian battery guarding Ryzhov&#x27;s cavalry at the end of the valley. Seeing Lucan&#x27;s confusion, Nolan could have explained what Raglan intended, perhaps making the link – if he himself knew of the connection – between the third and fourth order; however, taken aback by Nolan&#x27;s insolence, Lucan refused further discussion, and rode over to Cardigan standing in front of his brigade. Both cavalry commanders knew the dangers of attacking down the valley. When Cardigan learned what was expected of his brigade, he questioned the sanity of the order as conveyed to him by Lucan: &quot;… allow me to point out to you that the Russians have a battery in the valley in our front, and batteries and riflemen on each flank.&quot;

&quot;I know it,&quot; said Lucan. &quot;But Lord Raglan will have it. We have no choice but to obey.&quot;

The Light Brigade had formed up in two lines. The 13th Light Dragoons, the 17th Lancers, and the 11th Hussars, formed the first line (the latter regiment was soon moved behind the Lancers to reduce the width of the front). Paget commanded the second line formed by the 4th Light Dragoons and the 8th Hussars. Once the brigade had moved off, Lucan would follow with the Heavy Brigade in support.

At 11:10 the Light Brigade began their advance towards the Russians guns over a mile (~ 2 km) away. When the first line was clear of the second, the order was given to &#x27;Trot&#x27;. Initially there was nothing to indicate that Cardigan was not going to conform to Raglan&#x27;s intentions, and it was only after he had travelled some 200 yards (~180 m) that the enormity of the misconstrued order became apparent to the spectators on the Sapouné Heights. Instead of inclining to the right towards the redoubts on the Causeway Heights and the captured British guns, the Light Brigade continued towards Obolensky&#x27;s battery at the end of the valley but it was too late to do anything. Nolan was the first to be killed when he dashed forward ahead of Cardigan, either in an effort to force the pace, or, suddenly realising the terrible mistake that was being made (and his part in it), in an attempt to change the direction of the brigade towards Raglan&#x27;s intended objective. Whatever the reason, Nolan was hit by a splinter from a shell fired from one of the guns positioned on the Fedioukine Heights.

When the proper interval between themselves and the Lights had developed, Lucan led the Heavy Brigade forward. The Heavies were also hit—Lucan himself was slightly wounded, and his horse hit twice – but these men would have suffered more casualties had it not been for the charge of the 150 men of the Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique. The French cavalry had formed up to the left of the British position. When they had seen the Light Brigade cut up, Major Abdelal led an attack up the Fedioukine Heights to charge the flank of the Russian battery, forcing them to drag away their guns. Yet it was now that Lucan – concluding that the Light Brigade would be wiped out before they reached the Russians at the end of the valley – ordered the Heavy Brigade to halt their advance and retire, leaving Cardigan&#x27;s men without support. Turning to Lord Paulet, he justified his action and his desire to preserve at least half of his cavalry division, &quot;They have sacrificed the Light Brigade; they shall not have the Heavy, if I can help it.&quot;

At 11:15, the eight Russian guns on the Causeway Heights opened up on the Light Brigade, whose front line was now more than halfway down the valley; for the next 400 yards (~365 m) the men also came under fire from the guns to their front. At a distance of 250 yards (~ 230 m) from Obolensky&#x27;s battery, Cardigan ordered his bugler to sound the &#x27;Gallop&#x27;. &quot;And so we went through this scene of carnage,&quot; reported Paget, &quot;wondering each moment which would be our last … It required a deal of closing in, by this time, to fill up the vacant gaps.&quot; Cardigan now ordered the &#x27;Charge&#x27;. Some amongst the gun crews now doubted they could stop the advance – they could now see the lowered lances of the 17th Lancers. Having fired their last shot of canister some of the Russian artillerymen turned to run; others, knowing the consequences of turning their backs on cavalry, drew their swords.

====Mêlée and retreat====
At 11:17, half of the original 250 men of the 17th and 13th reached Obolensky&#x27;s battery. Some of the survivors fought with the Russians and tried to capture their guns; others reformed into small groups and prepared to charge the Russian cavalry standing 100 yards (~90 m) to the rear. Ryzhov had expected to mop up any Light Brigade survivors but his hussars and Cossacks, unnerved by the British horsemen, panicked and wheeled to escape. &quot;Some of the men fired on their own comrades to clear a passage for themselves,&quot; wrote Lieutenant Kubitovich. &quot;Our hussars were pressed as far as the Chernaya river where there was only one bridge by which they could escape.&quot; The 11th Hussars now joined the mêlée. Colonel Douglass, with 80 survivors, charged and pushed other Russian cavalry back to the Chernaya. Paget&#x27;s 4th Light Dragoons were next to reach the line of cannon, engaging in some &#x27;fierce hand-to-hand encounters&#x27; with the surviving gunners, before he too led his regiment after the fleeing Russians. Last to reach the objective were Colonel Shewell and the 8th Hussars. The regiment missed the battery altogether, except for a few on the extreme left who went amongst the remaining artillerymen stubbornly resisting; but the bulk of the regiment halted behind the guns and formed up in line.

All the survivors of the Light Brigade were now behind the Russian guns in the valley, yet the turning point of the action was the realisation that Lucan and the Heavy Brigade were not following in support. Russian officers, noticing how vastly superior their numbers were, managed to halt their retreat near the Chernaya, and edge forward their men. The Russian lancer regiments waiting on heights were now ordered down into the valley to form a line behind the British (the 13th, 17th, and 8th on the right of the valley, the 11th and 4th on the left) and block their route of escape. Those watching with Raglan thought the Light Brigade completely lost, but unexpectedly the two groups of survivors managed to break through the Russian trap. Still far from the British line, however, they once again came under fire from the guns and marksmen on the Causeway Heights. &quot;The truth must be told,&quot; recorded Lieutenant Koribut Kubitovich, &quot;that this fire hit us just as it did the enemy,&quot; but admitted that, &quot;The English fought with astounding bravery, and when we approached their dismounted and wounded men, even these refused to surrender and continued to fight till the ground was soaked with their blood.&quot;

Most of the survivors were back at the British lines by 12:00; the whole affair had lasted no more than 20 minutes. For those that returned there was a mixture of elation and anger, and questions as to what had happened to the Heavy Brigade. &quot;And who I ask is answerable for all this?&quot; wrote Troop Sergeant Major George Smith of the 11th Hussars. &quot;… it was not unlike leaving the forlorn hope, after storming a town, to fight their own way out again instead of pushing on the supports. We cut their army completely in two, taking their principal battery, driving their cavalry far to the rear. What more could 670 men do?&quot; But as they thought over what had occurred, the recriminations between Raglan, Lucan, and Cardigan had already begun. The Russian casualties were 33 killed and wounded (3rd Don Battery)

==Aftermath==

The loss of the Light Brigade had been such a traumatic event that the allies were incapable of further action that day. Of the 697 men known to have ridden in the charge (sources vary slightly), 271 became casualties: 110 killed (roughly a sixth), 129 wounded, plus another 32 wounded and taken prisoner. Additionally, 375 horses were killed. Raglan could not now risk using his infantry divisions in any attempt to move Liprandi&#x27;s forces from the Causeway Heights. Even if the redoubts were retaken, they would have to be defended by men whose priority was the siege of Sevastopol, and he dared not expose his supply base at Balaclava to further Russian attacks. The British 1st and 4th Infantry Divisions, therefore, returned to the plateau, the former without its Highland regiments who were ordered to remain in the valley under Campbell&#x27;s command.

To the Russians the Battle of Balaclava was a victory and proved a welcome boost in morale—they had captured the Allied redoubts (from which seven guns were removed and taken to Sevastopol as trophies), and had gained control of the Worontsov Road. The loss of the outer ring of defences severely restricted Allied movements and confined them to a narrow area between Balaclava and Sevastopol. Nearly all officers received awards. General Semyakin received the Order of St. George of the 3rd degree. Gribbe and Levutsky became cavaliers of the Order of St Stanislav of the 1st degree, and Colonel Krudener was promoted to Major General. General Liprandi was awarded a golden sabre encrusted with diamonds, and inscribed &#x27;For Bravery&#x27;. Semyakin wrote home with news of the action at Balaclava, and what he considered a great success – &quot;Many Turks and English were killed by our Russian bayonets, and many English were pierced with lances of our Uhlans and Cossacks, and by sabres of our Hussars … God grant that the heart of the Tsar rejoices.&quot; Similar sentiments persisted throughout the army, partial successes during the battle restored the ability of the Sevastopol garrison to fight.

All three armies would soon be reinforced: the British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, The Duke of Newcastle, promised Raglan that the 3rd, 62nd, and 90th Regiments would be despatched to the Crimea with a third battery train; Canrobert, meanwhile, was promised an additional three divisions of infantry from France. The Russians were also receiving reinforcements with the arrival of 10 and 11 Divisions which finally arrived at the beginning of November. These troops brought the strength of Menshikov&#x27;s field army to some 107,000 men, but the Russian commander was under severe pressure from St Petersburg to attack the Allied lines and break the siege of Sevastopol. The failure of the British and French to beat the Russians at Balaclava immediately set the stage for a much bloodier battle. For weeks it had been known that the Russians would soon begin a full-scale attack on the besiegers. As a preliminary Menshikov launched a reconnaissance in force on the extreme right of the Allied line (against the British 2nd Division) on the Inkerman Heights overlooking the Chernaya river. The attack on 26 October (the battle became known as &#x27;Little Inkerman&#x27;) proved a successful action for the British, but the Russians had gleaned all they needed to know about the position. Using this intelligence, Menshikov launched his main attack on the same position one week later on 5 November in what came to be known as the Battle of Inkerman.

<text>Regnans in Excelsis (&quot;Reigning on High&quot;) is a papal bull that Pope Pius V issued on 25 February 1570. It excommunicated Queen Elizabeth I of England, referring to her as &quot;the pretended Queen of England and the servant of crime&quot;, declared her a heretic, and released her subjects from allegiance to her, even those who had &quot;sworn oaths to her&quot;, and excommunicated any who obeyed her orders: &quot;We charge and command all and singular the nobles, subjects, peoples and others afore said that they do not dare obey her orders, mandates and laws. Those who shall act to the contrary we include in the like sentence of excommunication.&quot;

Among the queen&#x27;s offences, &quot;She has removed the royal Council, composed of the nobility of England, and has filled it with obscure men, being heretics; oppressed the followers of the Catholic faith; instituted false preachers and ministers of impiety; abolished the sacrifice of the mass, prayers, fasts, choice of meats, celibacy, and Catholic ceremonies; and has ordered that books of manifestly heretical content be propounded to the whole realm and that impious rites and institutions after the rule of Calvin, entertained and observed by herself, be also observed by her subjects.&quot;

The bull, written in Latin, is named from its &quot;incipit&quot;, the first three words of its text.

==Background==

The papacy had previously reconciled with Mary I, who returned the Church of England and Church of Ireland to Catholicism. After Mary&#x27;s death in November 1558, Elizabeth&#x27;s Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy of 1559, which re-established the Church of England and Church of Ireland&#x27;s independence from papal authority. This bull can be seen as an act of retaliation for the religious settlement, but it was delayed by eleven years, caused in part by a number of royal Catholic suitors who hoped to marry Elizabeth, and because she had allowed Catholic worship in private.

Pius V issued the bull in support of, but following, the failed Rising of the North of 1569, by which Catholic nobles attempted to depose Elizabeth and replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots, and the first Desmond Rebellion in Ireland, which broke out in June 1569. Although the Desmond Rebellion&#x27;s main goal was to preserve the independence of feudal lords from the English throne, it developed religious overtones as James FitzMaurice FitzGerald sought support from Catholic Europe.

==Content==
The bull declared Queen Elizabeth excommunicated and absolved her subjects from any allegiance to her. It also excommunicated any that obeyed her orders. Its argument drew on the hierocratic theory of the papacy established by medieval canonists.

Pius did not consult any Catholic rulers. Both Philip II of Spain and the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II disagreed with his approach. Philip thought, correctly, that it would only harden the Crown&#x27;s treatment of English Catholics. According to Evelyn Waugh, it provided a convenient pretext for those in Elizabeth&#x27;s court, looking for an excuse to do so, to persecute Roman Catholics, and they took full advantage of it.

To take effect in church law the bull had to be promulgated. This logistical effort relied on individuals such as John Felton.

==Aftermath==
The bull provoked the English government into taking more repressive actions against the Jesuits, whom they feared to be acting in the interests of Spain and the papacy. This reaction soon seemed justified: it was the publication in England of Pius&#x27;s exhortation that gave the impetus in 1571 to the Ridolfi plot, in which the Duke of Norfolk was to kidnap or murder Queen Elizabeth, install Mary, Queen of Scots, on the throne, and then become &quot;de facto&quot; king by marrying her.

Heinrich Bullinger of Zürich published a critique of the bull in 1571.

==Suspension from 1580 to 1584==
At the request of the Jesuits and to relieve the pressures on Catholics in England, it was said that Pope Gregory XIII issued a clarification or suspension in 1580, explaining that Catholics should obey the queen outwardly in all civil matters, until such time as a suitable opportunity presented itself for her overthrow. How widely this was communicated to, and understood by, Catholics in England and Ireland is unknown. The evidence against any suspension of the Bull comes from the small invasion of Ireland in 1579 led by James FitzMaurice FitzGerald that was supported by the Papacy. Then in 1580 Pope Gregory sponsored another abortive expedition to Ireland in support of the Second Desmond Rebellion, that ended in the tragic Siege of Smerwick. Soon after the start of the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604), an English Act &quot;against Jesuits, seminary priests and other such like disobedient persons&quot; was passed into law.

==Renewal in 1588==
In 1588, Pope Sixtus V, in support of the Spanish Armada, renewed the solemn bull of excommunication against Queen Elizabeth I, for the regicide of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1587 as well as the previously catalogued offences against the Catholic Church. During the threat of invasion by the Spanish Armada, it transpired that most of the Catholic residents in England remained loyal, and that those who were a real threat to the throne, like William, Cardinal Allen and Robert Persons, were already exiles.

While the bull had little impact in England, it caused a rift in Elizabeth&#x27;s Kingdom of Ireland where most of the population remained Roman Catholic; Gerald FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Desmond, had used the bull as justification for the Second Desmond Rebellion. While divisions had existed before 1570, after the bull the officials based in Dublin conformed to Anglicanism while the majority of the Parliament of Ireland were Catholics until 1613.

<text>Humiliation is the abasement of pride, which creates mortification or leads to a state of being humbled or reduced to lowliness or submission. It is an emotion felt by a person whose social status, either by force or willingly, has just decreased. It can be brought about through intimidation, physical or mental mistreatment or trickery, or by embarrassment if a person is revealed to have committed a socially or legally unacceptable act. Whereas humility can be sought alone as a means to de-emphasize the ego, humiliation must involve other person(s), though not necessarily directly or willingly.

Humiliation is currently an active research topic, and is now seen as an important – and complex – core dynamic in human relationships, having implications at intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional and international levels.

== Psychological effects ==
A person who suffers from severe humiliation could experience major depressions, suicidal states, and severe anxiety states such as post-traumatic stress disorder. The loss of status, like losing a job or being labeled as a liar or discredited unfairly, could cause people to be unable to behave normally in their communities. Humiliated individuals could be provoked and crave revenge, and some people could feel worthless, hopeless and helpless, creating suicidal thoughts if justice is not met. It also can lead to new insights, activism and a new kinship with marginalized groups.

Feelings of humiliation can produce &#x27;humiliated fury&#x27;, which when turned inward can result in apathy and depression, and when turned outward can give rise to paranoia, sadistic behavior and fantasies of revenge. Klein explains, &quot;When it is outwardly directed, humiliated fury unfortunately creates additional victims, often including innocent bystanders. When it is inwardly directed, the resulting self-hate renders victims incapable of meeting their own needs, let alone having energy available to love and care for others.

A study by researchers at the University of Michigan revealed that &quot;the same regions of the brain that become active in response to painful sensory experiences are activated during intense experiences of social rejection.&quot; In other words, humiliation and loneliness are experienced as intensely as physical pain.

== Punishments and interrogation tactics ==

Humiliation of one person by another (the humiliator) is often used as a way of asserting power over them, and is a common form of oppression or abuse used in a police, military, or prison context during legal interrogations or illegal torture sessions. Many now-obsolete public punishments were deliberately designed to be humiliating, e.g. tarring and feathering lawbreakers, pillory, &quot;mark of shame&quot; (stigma) as a means of &quot;making an example&quot; of a person and presenting a deterrent to others. Some practices, such as tarring and feathering, became tools of unofficial mob justice. In folk customs such as the English skimmington rides and rough music (and their continental equivalents, such as the French Charivari), dramatic public demonstrations of moral disapproval were enacted to humiliate transgressors and drive them out of the community.

Some U.S. states have experimented with humiliating or shaming lawbreakers by publishing their names and indicating their offense (e.g., with soliciting prostitutes or drinking and driving). In 2010, there was public outcry about reports showing police in Dongguan and Guangdong in China leading a parade of arrested prostitutes for the purpose of humiliating them. The national Ministry of Public Security reprimanded the local police and affirmed that such punishments are not allowed.

== A wider human perspective ==
Donald Klein described humiliation as &quot;a powerful factor in human affairs that has, for a variety of reasons, been overlooked by students of individual and collective behavior. It is a pervasive and all too destructive influence in the behavior of individuals, groups, organizations, and nations.&quot;

Though it is a subjective emotion, humiliation has a universal aspect which applies to all human beings: &quot;it is the feeling of being put down, made to feel less than one feels oneself to be.&quot;

A society that suffers from humiliation is an unstable one. The cognitive dissonance between the way in which the society is perceived and the way in which it sees itself can be so great that violence can result on a massive scale against people belonging to an out group. According to Jonathan Sacks, &quot;By turning the question &#x27;What did we do wrong?&#x27; into &#x27;Who did this to us?&#x27;, [hate against an out group] restores some measure of self-respect and provides a course of action. In psychiatry, the clinical terms for this process are splitting and projection; it allows people to define themselves as victims.&quot;

<text>Daniel Waldo (September 10, 1762 – July 30, 1864) was an American clergyman. Born in Windham, Connecticut, Waldo served in the American Revolutionary War and later became a missionary and clergyman. In 1856, at the age of 94, Waldo was named Chaplain of the House of Representatives. Waldo&#x27;s earliest ancestor Deacon Cornelius Waldo arrived to the American colonies from Ipswich, England around 1654.

It is recorded that Waldo was in good health during his service to the House; he was also one of seven Revolutionary War veterans who, having survived into the age of photography, were featured in the 1864 book &quot;The Last Men of the Revolution&quot; (which gives many more details of his life). He was purportedly the only person to have voted for both George Washington and Abraham Lincoln in presidential elections. 
Waldo died in Syracuse, New York at the advanced age of 101, of injuries sustained after falling down a flight of stairs, and he was given a memorial in the House itself.

<doc id="205840" wikidata="Q4438303" url="?curid=205840" title="The Sleeping Beauty Quartet">
<text>The Sleeping Beauty Quartet is a series of four novels written by American author Anne Rice under the pseudonym of A. N. Roquelaure. The quartet comprises &quot;The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty&quot;, &quot;Beauty&#x27;s Punishment&quot;, &quot;Beauty&#x27;s Release&quot;, and &quot;Beauty&#x27;s Kingdom&quot;, first published individually in 1983, 1984, 1985, and 2015, respectively, in the United States. They are erotic BDSM novels set in a medieval fantasy world, loosely based on the fairy tale of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. The novels describe explicit sexual adventures of the female protagonist Beauty and the male characters Alexi, Tristan, and Laurent, featuring both maledom and femdom scenarios amid vivid imageries of bisexuality, homosexuality, ephebophilia, and pony play.

In 1994, the abridged audio versions of the first three books were published in cassette form. &quot;The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty&quot; was read by actress Amy Brenneman. &quot;Beauty&#x27;s Punishment&quot; was read by Elizabeth Montgomery (known for her role in the ABC situation comedy &quot;Bewitched&quot;) as Beauty with Michael Diamond as Tristan, and &quot;Beauty&#x27;s Release&quot; was read by Montgomery with actor Christian Keiber reading as Laurent. A compact disc version of the audiobooks was read by Genviere Bevier and Winthrop Eliot.

== Background ==
After the success of &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; (1976), Anne Rice wrote two extensively researched historical novels, &quot;The Feast of All Saints&quot; (1979) and &quot;Cry to Heaven&quot; (1982). Neither of them gave her the critical acclaim or the commercial success of her first novel; the main complaints about &quot;The Feast of All Saints&quot; were that it was too heavy and dense to read easily, and most of the reviews for &quot;Cry to Heaven&quot; were so savagely negative that Rice felt devastated. She had been thinking about a story set during the time of Oscar Wilde for the next novel, but decided to abandon it and go back to the erotic writing she had explored in the 1960s. Her idea was &quot;to create a book where you didn&#x27;t have to mark the hot pages&quot; and &quot;to take away everything extraneous, as much as could be done in a narrative&quot;. To gain a creative freedom for the new work, Rice adopted the pen name A.N. Roquelaure from the French word &quot;&quot;, referring to a cloak worn by men in the 18th-century Europe. Rice only finally came out as the author of the trilogy during the later 1990s.

The trilogy was written in the 1980s when many feminists denounced pornography as violation of women&#x27;s rights, but Rice firmly believed that women should have the freedom to read and write whatever they pleased, and considered the trilogy her political statement.

A fourth book in the series, &quot;Beauty&#x27;s Kingdom&quot;, was published in April 2015.

==Plot==

===&quot;The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty&quot;===
In the first chapter of the story, Beauty is awakened from her hundred-year sleep by the Prince, not with a kiss, but through copulation, initiating her into a &quot;Satyricon&quot;-like world of sexual adventures. After stripping her naked he takes her to his kingdom, ruled by his mother Queen Eleanor, where Beauty is trained as a slave and a plaything. The rest of the naked slaves, dozens of them, in the Queen&#x27;s castle are princes and princesses sent by their royal parents from the surrounding kingdoms as tributes. In this castle they spend several years learning to become obedient and submissive sexual property, accepting being spanked and forced to have sex with nobles and slaves of both sexes, being publicly displayed and humiliated, and crawling around on their hands and knees like animals until they return to their own lands &quot;being enhanced in wisdom.&quot;

In the castle Beauty meets another slave, Prince Alexi, with whom she copulates passionately. After that he tells her about the long rigorous journey he had in the castle. Alexi previously had been a stubborn prince who fought back all the attempts to break him, until the Queen sent him to the kitchen to have him tortured by crude kitchen servants. Alexi received such a savage and merciless punishment there that he began to lose his senses and, after some particularly humiliating training at the hands of a strong stable boy, Alexi became a totally surrendered slave, playing various sexual games at the Queen&#x27;s commands.

The moral of Alexi&#x27;s story notwithstanding, Beauty willfully disobeys, and the book closes with her being sentenced to brutal slavery in the neighboring village while her master weeps.

===&quot;Beauty&#x27;s Punishment&quot;===
The second book starts as Beauty and another naked slave from the castle, Prince Tristan, are sold at auction in the village square. Beauty is purchased by the inn keeper Mistress Lockely while Tristan is bought by Nicholas, the Queen&#x27;s chronicler. At Lockely&#x27;s inn Beauty meets the Captain of the Guard, who forces her to pleasure him and then takes her to a drunken orgy with his soldiers. Tristan is bound and harnessed as a pony with a tail plugged in his rear, and made to pull Nicholas&#x27; cart while being whipped. When the cart arrives at an orchard, he is ordered to collect apples with his mouth, and trained to &quot;satisfy&quot; other human ponies in the stable. Afterward, Nicholas has Tristan paddled at the Public Turntable, which devastates the prince, and forcibly copulates with him in the bed.

The next day, after having made Tristan march through the crowded streets, which included a short but intense meeting with the Captain of the Guard, Nicholas asks Tristan a series of questions as to what makes a strong, highborn prince obey with such a complete submission. Tristan answers, after some hesitation, that he loves anyone who punishes him no matter how crude or lowly they are and desires the loss of his self amid all the punishments, eventually &quot;becoming&quot; the punishments himself. Nicholas is moved by the answer and, after a frantic intercourse, confesses to him that he is in love with Tristan.

Beauty witnesses the harsh punishment of a runaway slave, Prince Laurent, as he is bound to a wooden cross and the Captain whips him all over his muscular body, and later sees Tristan pulling a cart carrying Laurent in a penitential procession. Tristan begs Nicholas to be allowed to meet Beauty and they reunite in Nicholas&#x27; house. Beauty and Tristan copulate as Nicholas watches behind a one-way mirror. Suddenly, Arab soldiers raid the village and several naked slaves, including Beauty, Tristan, and Laurent, are kidnapped. The book closes as they are sent across the sea to serve in the palace of the Sultan.

===&quot;Beauty&#x27;s Release&quot;===
The third book begins with the captured slaves&#x27; journey on the ship to the Sultan&#x27;s realm. While being imprisoned in a cage, Laurent contemplates the recent punishments he received as a runaway on a wooden cross, recalling its pain, degradation and undeniable pleasure. After their arrival at the exotic land of the Sultan, the captured slaves are groomed by a group of young boys and examined by Lexius, the Sultan&#x27;s steward. Beauty is taken to the harem and is mounted on the phallus of a bronze statue. She is then greeted by Inanna, one of the Sultan&#x27;s wives, with whom she copulates and is shocked to discover that Inanna&#x27;s clitoris has been surgically removed.

Laurent and Tristan are taken to an all-male sadomasochistic orgy, being mounted on a cross and whipped. However, in private, Laurent overpowers Lexius and rapes him. Afterward Laurent and Tristan are taken to the Sultan, made to perform a mutual fellatio on each other in his presence, and then the Sultan anally copulates with Laurent. Laurent and Tristan retire from the Sultan&#x27;s bedroom and when they are beginning to train Lexius as their secret slave, a rescue team led by the Captain of the Guard arrives and Laurent takes Lexius with him to their ship along with Beauty and Tristan. During the last leg of the voyage, the Captain tells Beauty that she is to be released from her servitude because of her parents&#x27; demands and, to her great dismay, sent back home to get married: she hysterically protests, but to no avail.

Back at the castle, the Queen takes Lexius as her slave and sends him to the merciless kitchen servants who trained Prince Alexi earlier in the first book. She then sentences both Laurent and Tristan to the village stable for Laurent&#x27;s rebelliousness and Tristan&#x27;s failure to become a good slave. They are made to live and work as ponies, pulling all sorts of carts and drawing plows in the fields during the daytime, and having homosexual orgies with other human ponies at night. Tristan, as a pony, reunites with his former owner Nicholas on a temporary basis. However, Laurent&#x27;s father unexpectedly dies and he is summoned back to his own kingdom against his wish, to become the new ruler. The book ends as Laurent marries Beauty, saying that they shall live happily ever after, or perhaps &quot;a good deal happier&quot; than anyone else could ever guess— thus hinting that they will continue the pleasure of dominance and submission with each other.

===&quot;Beauty&#x27;s Kingdom&quot;===
Twenty years after the events of &quot;Beauty&#x27;s Release&quot;, Beauty and Laurent take over the throne following the death of Queen Eleanor and strive to continue the sensual surrender legacy of the kingdom, albeit now in a state of voluntary servitude.

==Themes==
The fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty has been analyzed by folklorists and other scholars of various types, and many of them have noticed prominent erotic elements of the story. Some versions of the tale have Beauty raped and pregnant while sleeping, and only waking up after childbirth. The child psychologist Bruno Bettelheim commented that the tale &quot;abounds with Freudian symbolism&quot; and that the princes who try to reach Sleeping Beauty before the appropriate time only to perish in the thorns surrounding her castle serves as a warning that premature sexual encounters are destructive. Feminist theorists have focused on Sleeping Beauty&#x27;s extreme passivity and the sexual nature of her awakening in the fairy tale. Anne Rice literalized these symbolic sexual elements—particularly, the passive sexual awakening or rape of Beauty that has been denounced by feminists—in the story by rewriting it into an explicit sadomasochistic erotica. However, Rice&#x27;s cross-gender identification with the submissive male characters with receptive capacity in the trilogy—Alexi, Tristan and Laurent—enabled her to circumvent the equation of the female gender and masochism and, via their homoerotic interactions with the dominant male characters, she could exploit the erotic potential of phallic power while at the same time going beyond its boundary and &quot;turning it against itself&quot;.

Another foremost difference in Rice&#x27;s rewriting is that the story takes Beauty to a series of far harsher trials after her period of extreme passivity in a coma-like sleep. In the beginning of the first book, the Prince takes Beauty with her parents&#x27; consent, having persuaded them that, after completing the sexual servitude in his castle, the slaves emerge with &quot;wisdom, patience, and self-discipline&quot;, as well as a full acceptance of their innermost desires and an understanding of the suffering of humankind. Her royal parents, although saddened by the absence of their daughter, are promised that she will return &quot;greatly enhanced in wisdom and beauty&quot;. However, this unconventional education in sexual hardship and liberation ends in a monogamous, patriarchal marriage between Beauty and Laurent. In the 1994 issue of &quot;Feminist Review&quot;, Professor Amalia Ziv of Ben-Gurion University described the trilogy as &quot;definitely more of a comedy&quot; when compared to darker BDSM novels such as &quot;Story of O&quot;, and commented that &quot;like all comedies, it ends in marriage&quot;.

==Reception==
The trilogy was a commercial success and gained a significant cult following. Rice was able to secure the publishing contract for her next erotic novel &quot;Exit to Eden&quot; (1985) with an advance of $35,000 () from Arbor House. There were allegations that Rice was a dominatrix in real life since the trilogy deals with the BDSM practice so exclusively, but her husband, Stan Rice, replied that &quot;she&#x27;s no more sadomasochistic than she&#x27;s a vampire&quot;. When the director of the Columbus Metropolitan Library declared the trilogy &quot;hardcore pornography&quot; and removed all print and audiocassette copies from the library shelves in 1996, Rice objected, arguing that the trilogy was &quot;elegantly sensual&quot; and harmless to readers. The trilogy is included in the American Library Association&#x27;s list of &quot;100 most frequently challenged books&quot; of the 1990s, with the term &quot;challenge&quot; defined in American literature as &quot;an attempt to remove or restrict materials, based upon the objections of a person or group&quot;.

Professor Linda Badley of Middle Tennessee State University wrote in her 1996 book &quot;Writing Horror and the Body&quot; on the trilogy, that rewriting the myth of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; as sadomasochistic fantasies enabled Anne Rice to explore &quot;liminal areas of experience that could not be articulated in conventional literature, extant pornography, or politically correct discourse&quot;.

==Television adaptation==
It was announced in September 2014 that Televisa U.S.A had obtained the rights to adapt the trilogy into a television series. Rice was to serve as executive producer alongside Rachel Winter, producer of the film &quot;Dallas Buyers Club&quot;. Winter had previously approached Rice in 2012 regarding such plans that did not materialize at the time. , the series was still in early development.
