<text>Frederick Douglass &quot;Fritz&quot; Pollard (January 27, 1894 – May 11, 1986) was an American professional football player and coach. In 1921, he became the first African-American head coach in the National Football League (NFL). Pollard and Bobby Marshall were the first two African-American players in the NFL in 1920. Football pioneer Walter Camp called Pollard &quot;one of the greatest runners these eyes have ever seen.&quot;

==Early life==
Pollard was born in Chicago to John W. Pollard, a barber and Union army veteran, and Catherine Amanda Hughes Pollard, a seamstress. Pollard&#x27;s siblings included advertising executive Luther J. Pollard and librarian Naomi Pollard Dobson.

He attended Albert G. Lane Manual Training High School in Chicago, also known as &quot;Lane Tech,&quot; where he played football, baseball, and ran track. He then went to Brown University, majoring in chemistry. Pollard played halfback on the Brown football team, which went to the 1916 Rose Bowl. He became the first African American running back to be named to Walter Camp&#x27;s All-America team.

==Career==
Pollard coached Lincoln University&#x27;s football team in Oxford, Pennsylvania during the 1918 to 1920 seasons and served as athletic director of the school&#x27;s World War I era Students&#x27; Army Training Corps. During 1918–1919, he led the team to a victorious season defeating Howard University&#x27;s Bisons 13–0 in the annual Thanksgiving classic as well as Hampton University (7–0) on November 9, 1918, and teams of military recruits at Camp Dix (19–0) on November 2, 1918, and Camp Upton (41–0). By the fall of 1920, he had begun to play for Akron, missing key Lincoln losses to Hampton (0–14) and Howard (0–42), much to the consternation of the alumni and administration. Paul Robeson was enlisted by Lincoln&#x27;s alumni to coach the Thanksgiving 1920 game against Howard.

Pollard criticized Lincoln&#x27;s administration, saying they had hampered his ability to coach and had refused to provide adequate travel accommodations for the team. &quot;Prior to the Hampton game, the team was compelled to go to Hampton by boat, sleeping on the decks and under portholes,&quot; he told a reporter. &quot;No cabins were provided, nor were they given a place to sleep after reaching Hampton. They lost the game through lack of rest.&quot; He also blamed the school for not providing the proper equipment. &quot;I, myself, bought and paid $200 out of my pocket for football shoes for the team.&quot; He missed the 1920 Howard game, he said, because his Lincoln salary was so low that he was compelled to augment it with pay from Akron.
He played professional football with the Akron Pros, the team he would lead to the APFA championship in 1920. In 1921, he became the co-head coach of the Akron Pros, while still maintaining his roster position as running back. He also played for the Milwaukee Badgers, Hammond Pros, Gilberton Cadamounts, Union Club of Phoenixville and Providence Steam Roller. An article in the October 1, 1921 issue of &quot;the Chicago Whip&quot; newspaper stated that Pollard served as &quot;assistant coach of the backfield men&quot; of Northwestern University&#x27;s football team.

Some sources indicate that Pollard also served as co-coach of the Milwaukee Badgers with Budge Garrett for part of the 1922 season.

On November 19, 1922, Pollard and Paul Robeson led the Badgers to victory over the great Jim Thorpe and his Oorang Indians. The final was 13–0 with Robeson scoring both touchdowns in his finest pro football performance.

Fritz also coached the Gilberton Cadamounts, a non-NFL team. In 1923 and 1924, he served as head coach for the Hammond Pros.

Pollard, along with all nine of the African American players in the NFL at the time, were removed from the league at the end of the 1926 season, never to return again. He spent some time organizing all-African American barnstorming teams, including the Chicago Black Hawks in 1928 and the Harlem Brown Bombers in the 1930s.

==Later life==
In the 1930s, Pollard founded his own professional football team, the Brown Bombers. The Depression ended the Brown Bombers&#x27; run in 1938, and Pollard went on to other ventures, including a talent agency, tax consulting, and film and music production. He produced &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Blues&quot; in 1956, which included such performers as Connie Carroll, The Harptones, The Five Miller Sisters, Pearl Woods, Linda Hopkins, Elyce Roberts, The Hurricanes, and The Wanderers.

===New York Independent News===
Pollard also published the New York Independent News from 1935 to 1942, purportedly the first African American-owned tabloid in New York City. The war and a rivalry forced it to close. The paper&#x27;s offices were on 125th Street and at its peak, the paper had a weekly circulation of approximately thirty-five thousand, ranking it among the top most read Black newspapers in the country.

<doc id="207169" wikidata="Q1422160" url="?curid=207169" title="Alouette 1">
<text>Alouette 1 is a deactivated Canadian satellite that studied the ionosphere. Launched in 1962, it was Canada&#x27;s first satellite, and the first satellite constructed by a country other than the Soviet Union or the United States. Canada was the fourth country to operate a satellite, as the British &quot;Ariel 1&quot;, constructed in the United States by NASA, preceded &quot;Alouette 1&quot; by five months. The name &quot;Alouette&quot; came from the French for &quot;skylark&quot; and the French-Canadian folk song of the same name.

A key device on &quot;Alouette&quot; were the radio antennas consisting of thin strips of beryllium copper bent into a slight U-shape and then rolled up into small disks in a fashion similar to a measuring tape. When triggered, the rotation of the satellite created enough centrifugal force to pull the disk away from the spacecraft body, and the shaping of the metal caused it to unwind into a long spiral. The result was a stiff circular cross-section antenna known as a &quot;STEM&quot;, for &quot;storable tubular extendible member&quot;.

== Development ==

&quot;Alouette 1&quot; was part of a joint Canada-U.S. scientific program. Its purpose was to investigate the properties of the top of the ionosphere, and the dependence of those properties on geographical location, season, and time of day. &quot;Alouette 1&quot; was advanced for its time, and NASA initially doubted whether the available technology would be sufficient. Nevertheless, NASA was eager to collaborate with international partners. NASA was convinced to participate by the prospect of obtaining data on the ionosphere, and Canada had the additional objective of developing its own space research programme. The United Kingdom also aided the mission by providing support at two ground stations, in Singapore and at Winkfield.

===Experiments===

&quot;Alouette 1&quot; carried four scientific experiments:
*Sweep-Frequency Sounder. This experiment measured the electron density distribution in the ionosphere by measuring the time delay between the emission and return of radio pulses. The sounder was able to emit pulses with frequencies between 1 and 12 megahertz, with a power of 100 W.
*Energetic particle detectors. An arrangement of Geiger counters and scintillators for detecting energetic particles.
*VLF Receiver. An experiment for measuring both artificial and natural VLF signals. It was sensitive to frequencies between 400 and 10,000 Hz.
*Cosmic Radio Noise. Two long radio antennas used for detecting radio noise from the Sun and the Galaxy.

The satellite did not have a tape recorder to store data. It was only possible to obtain data when the satellite was in range of a receiving station.

=== Duplicate construction ===

Two satellites were built for redundancy in case of a malfunction; if the first unit failed, the second could be launched with only a couple of months delay. It took 3½ years after &quot;Alouette&quot;″s proposal to have it developed and built. The satellites S27-2 (prototype), S27-3 (which became the launched satellite), and S27-4 (which became the backup) were assembled by Defence Research Telecommunications Establishment (DRTE) Electronics Lab in Ottawa, Ontario. The mechanical frame and the deployable STEM antennas were made by Special Products and Applied Research Aerospace (SPAR Aerospace), a former division of de Havilland Canada (DHC) in North York, Ontario, in a building which many years later (until 2012) housed the Canadian Air and Space Museum. The batteries used for &quot;Alouette&quot; were developed by the Defence Chemical, Biological, and Radiation Laboratory (DCBRL), another branch of DRB, and were partially responsible for the long lifetime of the satellite. The &quot;Storable Tubular Extendable Member&quot; antennas used were the first of DHC&#x27;s STEM antennas used in space, and at launch were the longest (150 feet tip to tip). Companies such as RCA Victor and Spar Aerospace Limited produced some of their first pieces of space equipment for the Alouette 1 project. Parts used for the construction of Alouette 1 can still be found in the Musée des ondes Emile Berliner in Montreal, Quebec where part of the satellite was worked on.

== Satellite launch and mission progress ==

&quot;Alouette 1&quot; was launched via Thor-Agena-B two-stage rocket by NASA from the Pacific Missile Range at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, USA at 06:05 UTC on September 29, 1962, into orbit around Earth. The satellite was placed into an almost circular orbit with an altitude of to with an inclination of 80.5°. The launch made Canada the third nation, after the USSR and the United States, to design and construct its own satellite. &quot;Alouette&quot; was used to study the ionosphere, using over 700 different radio frequencies to investigate its properties from above.

The satellite was initially spin-stabilized, rotating 1.4 times per minute. After about 500 days, the rotation had slowed to about 0.6 rpm and the spin-stabilization failed at this point. It was then possible to determine the satellite&#x27;s orientation only by readings from a magnetometer and from temperature sensors on the upper and lower heat shields. The orientation determinations obtained this way were only accurate to within 10 degrees. It is likely that gravitational gradients had caused the longest antenna to point towards the Earth.

A 2010 technical report by the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency titled &quot;Collateral Damage to Satellites from an EMP Attack&quot; lists &quot;Alouette 1&quot; among the satellites damaged by residual radiation from the July 9, 1962, Starfish Prime high-altitude nuclear test conducted by the United States. Another article, titled &quot;Anthropogenic Space Weather&quot;, indicates &quot;Alouette 1&quot; sustained no significant adverse effects from the Starfish radiation, most likely due to a very conservative power supply design that allowed for a 40% degradation of solar cell performance. 

&quot;Alouette&quot;″s mission lasted for 10 years before the satellite was deliberately switched off on September 30, 1972. The satellite remains in orbit; in 1966 it was estimated that &quot;Alouette 1&quot; would remain in orbit for 1000 years.

==Post mission==
After &quot;Alouette 1&quot; was launched, the upper stage of the rocket used to launch the satellite became a derelict object that would continue to orbit Earth for many years. , the upper stage remains in orbit.

The satellite itself became a derelict, remaining in Earth orbit .
The &quot;Alouette 1&quot; was named an IEEE Milestone in 1993. It is featured on the Amory Adventure Award.

&quot;Alouette 1&quot;″s backup was later launched, with some modification, as &quot;Alouette 2&quot; in 1965 to &quot;replace&quot; the older &quot;Alouette 1&quot;.

<text>Laban Ainsworth (July 19, 1757 – March 17, 1858) was an American clergyman and pastor. He holds the record for the longest serving pastorate in American history. He served as pastor in Jaffrey, New Hampshire from 1782 to 1858, a period of 76 years.

==Biography==
Laban Ainsworth was born in Woodstock, Connecticut on July 19, 1757, to Captain William Ainsworth and his wife, Mary Ainsworth. As a result of suffering a severe attack of scarlet fever in childhood, young Laban&#x27;s right arm became withered and &quot;nearly useless to him for life.&quot; As a result of this disability, he was able to focus on his education. While he hoped to enter Harvard College in 1775, the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War prevented him from doing this and instead caused him to attend Dartmouth College—from which he graduated in 1778.

At Stockbridge, Massachusetts, he studied theology under the guidance of Reverend Stephen West. He also preached for two years at Spencertown, New York, where he served as a chaplain for a few months with Major McKinstry&#x27;s Corps in the American Revolutionary Army. In 1782, he became pastor of Jaffrey, New Hampshire—a position that he held until his death 76 years later at age 100. In 1787, he married Mary Minot (1761–1845) and had two children with her, Sarah (1789–1857) and William (1792–1842).

<text>In trigonometry and geometry, triangulation is the process of determining the location of a point by forming triangles to the point from known points.

== Applications ==

===In surveying===

Specifically in surveying, triangulation involves only angle measurements at known points, rather than measuring distances to the point directly as in trilateration; the use of both angles and distance measurements is referred to as .

===In computer vision===
Computer stereo vision and optical 3D measuring systems use this principle to determine the spatial dimensions and the geometry of an item. Basically, the configuration consists of two sensors observing the item. One of the sensors is typically a digital camera device, and the other one can also be a camera or a light projector. The projection centers of the sensors and the considered point on the object&#x27;s surface define a (spatial) triangle. Within this triangle, the distance between the sensors is the base &quot;b&quot; and must be known. By determining the angles between the projection rays of the sensors and the basis, the intersection point, and thus the 3D coordinate, is calculated from the triangular relations.

==History==

Triangulation today is used for many purposes, including surveying, navigation, metrology, astrometry, binocular vision, model rocketry and, in the military, the gun direction, the trajectory and distribution of fire power of weapons.

The use of triangles to estimate distances dates to antiquity. In the 6th century BC, about 250 years prior to the establishment of the Ptolemaic dynasty, the Greek philosopher Thales is recorded as using similar triangles to estimate the height of the pyramids of ancient Egypt. He measured the length of the pyramids&#x27; shadows and that of his own at the same moment, and compared the ratios to his height (intercept theorem). Thales also estimated the distances to ships at sea as seen from a clifftop by measuring the horizontal distance traversed by the line-of-sight for a known fall, and scaling up to the height of the whole cliff. Such techniques would have been familiar to the ancient Egyptians. Problem 57 of the Rhind papyrus, a thousand years earlier, defines the &quot;seqt&quot; or &quot;seked&quot; as the ratio of the run to the rise of a slope, &quot;i.e.&quot; the reciprocal of gradients as measured today. The slopes and angles were measured using a sighting rod that the Greeks called a &quot;dioptra&quot;, the forerunner of the Arabic alidade. A detailed contemporary collection of constructions for the determination of lengths from a distance using this instrument is known, the &quot;Dioptra&quot; of Hero of Alexandria (–70 AD), which survived in Arabic translation; but the knowledge became lost in Europe until in 1615 Snellius, after the work of Eratosthenes, reworked the technique for an attempt to measure the circumference of the earth. In China, Pei Xiu (224–271) identified &quot;measuring right angles and acute angles&quot; as the fifth of his six principles for accurate map-making, necessary to accurately establish distances, while Liu Hui () gives a version of the calculation above, for measuring perpendicular distances to inaccessible places.

<doc id="207175" wikidata="Q1516252" url="?curid=207175" title="Hymnal">
<text>A hymnal or hymnary is a collection of hymns, usually in the form of a book, called a hymnbook (or hymn book). They are used in congregational singing. A hymnal may contain only hymn texts (normal for most hymnals for most centuries of Christian history); written melodies are extra, and more recently harmony parts have also been provided.

Hymnals are omnipresent in churches but are not often discussed; nevertheless, liturgical scholar Massey H. Shepherd once observed: &quot;In all periods of the Church&#x27;s history, the theology of the people has been chiefly molded by their hymns.&quot;

==Elements and format ==

Since the twentieth century, singer-songwriter hymns have become common, but in previous centuries, generally poets wrote the words, and musicians wrote the tunes. The texts are known and indexed by their first lines (&quot;incipits&quot;) and the hymn tunes are given names, sometimes geographical (the tune &quot;New Britain&quot; for the incipit &quot;Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound&quot;). The hymnal editors curate the texts and the tunes. They may take a well-known tune and associate it with new poetry, or edit the previous text; hymnal committees are typically staffed by both poets and musicians. Some hymnals are produced by church bodies and others by commercial publishers.

In large denominations, the hymnal may be part of a coordinated publication project that involves several books: the pew hymnal proper; an accompaniment version (e.g. using a ring binder so that individual hymns can be removed and sit nicely on a music stand); a leader&#x27;s guide (e.g. matching hymns to lectionary readings); and a hymnal companion, providing descriptions about the context, origin and character of each hymn, with a focus on their poets and composers.

===Service music===
In some hymnals, the front section is occupied by service music, such as doxologies, three-fold and seven-fold amens, or entire orders of worship (Gradual, Alleluia, etc.). A section of responsorial psalms may also be included.

===Indexes===
Hymnals usually contain one or more indexes; some of the specialized indexes may be printed in the companion volumes rather than the hymnal itself. A first line index is almost universal. There may also be indexes for the first line of every stanza, the first lines of choruses, tune names, and a metrical index (tunes by common meter, short meter, etc.). Indexes for composers, poets, arrangers, translators, and song sources may be separate or combined. Lists of copyright acknowledgements are essential. Few other books are so well indexed; at the same time, few other books are so well memorized. Singers often have the song number of their favorite hymns memorized, as well as the words of other hymns. In this sense, a hymnal is the intersection of advanced literate culture with the persistent survival or oral traditions into the present day.

==History==

===Origins in Europe===

The earliest hand-written hymnals are from the Middle Ages in the context of European Christianity, although individual hymns such as the &quot;Te Deum&quot; go back much further. The Reformation in the 16th century, together with the growing popularity of moveable type, quickly made hymnals a standard feature of Christian worship in all major denominations of Western and Central Europe. The first known printed hymnal was issued in 1501 in Prague by Czech Brethren (a small radical religious group of the Bohemian Reformation) but it contains only texts of sacred songs. The Ausbund, an Anabaptist hymnal published in 1564, is still used by the Amish, making it the oldest hymnal in continuous use. The first hymnal of the Lutheran Reformation was &quot;Achtliederbuch&quot;, followed by the &quot;Erfurt Enchiridion&quot;. An important hymnal of the 17th century was &quot;Praxis pietatis melica&quot;.

===Hymnals in Early America===

Market forces rather than denominational control have characterized the history of hymnals in the thirteen colonies and the antebellum United States; even today, denominations must yield to popular tastes and include &quot;beloved hymns&quot; such as Amazing Grace and Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing, in their hymnals, regardless of whether the song texts conform to sectarian teaching.

The first hymnal, and also the first book, printed in British North America, is the Bay Psalm Book, printed in 1640 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a metrical Psalter that attempted to translate the psalms into English so close to the original Hebrew that it was unsingable. The market demand created by this failure, and the dismal nature of Calvinist &quot;lining out the psalms&quot; in general, was served by hymnals for West gallery singing imported from England.

William Billings of Boston took the first step beyond West Gallery music in publishing &quot;The New-England Psalm-Singer&quot; (1770), the first book in which tunes were entirely composed by an American. The tune-books of Billings and other Yankee tunesmiths were widely sold by itinerant singing-school teachers. The song texts were predominantly drawn from English metrical psalms, particularly those of Isaac Watts. All of the publications of these tunesmiths (also called &quot;First New England School&quot;) were essentially hymnals.

In 1801, the tunebook market was greatly expanded by the invention of shape notes, which made it easier to learn how to read music. John Wyeth, a Unitarian printer in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, who had apprenticed in Boston during the emergence of the First New England School, began to publish tunebooks in 1810 in German and English for various sectarian groups (but not Unitarians). He saw a virgin market in the Methodist and Baptist revival movement. Singing in these camp meetings was chaotic because multiple tunes were sung simultaneously for any given hymn text. Since he lacked musical training, Wyeth employed Elkanah Kelsey Dare to collect tunes and edit them. Wyeth&#x27;s Repository of Music, Part Second (1813) included 41 folk tunes, the first printed in America. This was also the birth of the &quot;folk hymn&quot;: the use of a folk tune, collected and harmonized by a trained musician, printed with a hymn text. &quot;Nettleton,&quot; the tune used in North America to sing &quot;Come Thou Fount&quot; (words written in 1758), first appeared here.

===Southern Shape Note Hymnals (Tunebooks)===

Southerners identified with folk hymns of Wyeth&#x27;s 1813 &quot;Part Second&quot; and collected more: the titles of Kentucky Harmony (1816) of Ananias Davisson, the &quot;Tennessee Harmony&quot; (1818) of Alexander Johnson, the Missouri Harmony (1820) of Allen D. Carden. and the Southern Harmony (1835) of William Walker drew attention to the fact that they contained regional folk songs for singing in two, three, or four parts. A new direction was taken by B. F. White with the publication of the Sacred Harp (1844): whereas others had gone on to produce a series of tunebooks, White stopped at one, then spent the rest of his life building an organization, modeled on church conventions, to organize singing events, with the result that the &quot;Sacred Harp&quot; continues as a living tradition to the present. The other tunebooks eventually yielded to denominational hymnals that became pervasive with the development of railroad networks, with the exception of the &quot;Southern Harmony,&quot; for which there is an annual singing in Benton, Kentucky to the present day, and Walker&#x27;s Christian Harmony, published in 1866, with the first convention organized in 1875 (43 all-day singings in 2010); the &quot;Kentucky Harmony&quot; was republished in altered form as the Shenandoah Harmony in 2010, reviving the world of predominantly minor key melodies and unusual tonalities of Davisson&#x27;s work.

===The Better Music Movement in the Industrialized North===

In the North, the &quot;Better Music Boys,&quot; cultivated musicians such as Lowell Mason and Thomas Hastings who turned to Europe for musical inspiration, introduced musical education into the school system, and emphasized the use of organs, choirs, and &quot;special music.&quot; In the long term this resulted in a decline of congregational singing. On the other hand, they also composed hymns that could be sung by everybody. Mason&#x27;s &quot;The Handel and Haydn Society Collection of Church Music&quot; (1822) was published by the Handel and Haydn Society of Boston while Mason was still living in Savannah; nobody else would publish it. This never became a denominational hymnal but was well-received by choirs. Mason&#x27;s famous hymns, which were also included in Southern tunebooks, appeared later editions or publications: Laban (&quot;My soul, be on thy guard;&quot; 1830), Hebron (&quot;Thus far the Lord hath led me on,&quot; 1830), Boylston (&quot;My God, my life, my love,&quot; 1832), Shawmut (&quot;Oh that I could repent! 1835&quot;) Bethany (&quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee&quot;, as sung in the United States) (1856).

===&quot;Hymns Ancient and Modern&quot; appears in England===

In England, the growing popularity of hymns inspired the publication of more than 100 hymnals during the period 1810–1850. The sheer number of these collections prevented any one of them from being successful. In 1861, members of the Oxford Movement published Hymns Ancient and Modern under the musical supervision of William Henry Monk, with 273 hymns. For the first time, translations from languages other than Hebrew appeared, the &quot;Ancient&quot; in the title referring to the appearance of Phos Hilaron, translated from Greek by John Keble, and many hymns translated from Latin. This was a game-changer. The &quot;Hymns Ancient and Modern&quot; experienced immediate and overwhelming success. Total sales in 150 years were over 170 million copies. As such, it set the standard for many later hymnals on both sides of the Atlantic. English-speaking Lutherans in America began singing the metrical translations of German chorales by Catherine Winkworth and Jane Laurie Borthwick, and rediscovered their heritage. Although closely associated with the Church of England, &quot;Hymns Ancient and Modern&quot; was a private venture by a committee, called the Proprietors, chaired by Sir Henry Baker.

<text>Nikolai Ivanovich Kibalchich (; ; 19 October 1853 – April 3, 1881) was a Russian revolutionary who took part in the assassination of Tsar Alexander II as the main explosive expert for Narodnaya Volya (&quot;People&#x27;s Will&quot;), and was also a rocket pioneer. He was a distant cousin of revolutionary Victor Serge.

==Early life==
Born in the town of Korop, Krolevetsky Uyezd, Chernigov Governorate (present-day Ukraine) in 1853 into a clerical family, Kibalchich was the son of an Orthodox parish priest. He entered a gymnasium in 1864 but was later admitted to a seminary. But he returned to secondary school and finishing it with a silver medal several years later.

In 1871 he entered St Petersburg Institute of Railway Engineers and in 1873 he entered Saint Petersburg Emperor Military Medical Academy to study medicine and worked on experiments into pulsed rocket propulsion.

==Biography==
In October 1875, Kibalchich was arrested for lending a prohibited book to a peasant named Prytulya. He spent 3 years in prison before being sentenced to 2 months imprisonment.

He went on to join Narodnaya Volya in 1878, becoming their main explosives expert.

==Assassination of Alexander II==

During the night from February 28 to March 1, 1881, Kibalchich and his assistants, Fleet Lieutenant Sukhanov and Mikhail Grachevsky, prepared four explosive projectiles that were used in the assassination of Alexander II later that day. Kibalchich was arrested on March 17, 1881.

In his statement to the Special Committee of the Senate, V.N. Gerard noted that when his men came to see Kibalchich as his appointed counsel for the defense, they were surprised to find his mind occupied with things that had no bearing on the trial. He seemed to be immersed in research on some aeronautic missile and he greatly desired the opportunity to write down the calculations involved in the discovery.

In a note written in his prison cell, Kibalchich proposed a manned jet air-navigating apparatus. He examined the design of a gunpowder-powered rocket engine, controlling the flight by changing the engine&#x27;s angle, and his design is dated March 23. He produced this scientific work truly at death&#x27;s door.

On March 26, General Komarov, Chief of the Gendarmery Department, informed the Police Department of Kibalchich&#x27;s design. The brief written in the report said: &quot;To be filed with the March 1 dossier and to give this to scientists for consideration now would hardly be expedient since this can only give rise to a lot of wanton talk. Kibalchich&#x27;s design was put in an envelope, sealed and filed. The inventor was told that his design would be handed over to scientists for examination.&quot;

Kibalchich awaited for their answer. The month of March was at an end, with two days left before execution. On March 31 Kibalchich wrote this solicitation address to the Minister of Interior: &quot;By instruction of your Excellency my design of an aeronautic apparatus has been submitted for the consideration of technical committee; could your Excellency direct that I be allowed to meet with any of the committee members on the matter of this design not later than tomorrow morning or at least to receive a written answer from the experts who have examined my design, also no longer than tomorrow. I also ask your Excellency for permission for me, before I die, to meet with all my comrades
in the trial or at least with Zhelyabov and Perovskaya.&quot; All of his requests were ignored.

==Execution==
At 7:50 AM on the sunny spring morning of April 3 two &quot;chariots of shame&quot; with the 
condemned prisoners rode out of the house of the detention to Shpalernaya Street. Zhelyabov was 
in the first, and by his side was Rysakov, who had tossed the first bomb at the coach of 
Alexander II and then betrayed his comrades during the interrogation. Kibalchich, Perovskaya and Mikhailov were in the second. The hands and feet of the condemned were tied to the seats. Each had on his chest a black plaque with the white colored inscription: &quot;A regicide&quot;.

At 9:21 AM the executioner removed the foot stool from under the feet of Kibalchich. Mikhailov, Perovskaya, Zhelyabov and Rysakov were executed after him.

Thus, Kibalchich and other Narodnaya Volya plotters including Sophia Perovskaya, Andrei Zhelyabov, Nikolai Rysakov and Timofei Mikhailov were hanged on April 3, 1881.

==Final letter==
 

==Legacy==

The fate of the invention, mentioned in Kybalchych&#x27;s last letter, proved to be as tragic as that of its 27-year-old creator. Kibalchich&#x27;s 
design was buried in the archives of Police Department, but the tsar authorities failed to consign 
the name of the inventor and his idea to oblivion. The trial and execution of the Narodniks had wide 
repercussions around the world. Much was said and written about Kibalchich&#x27;s design abroad and all
kinds of conjectures were made about the essence of the invention and its subsequent fate. In 1917, Nikolai Rynin rediscovered the manuscript in the archives and published an account of it 1918 in the historic magazine &quot;Byloye&quot; (Былое, &quot;The Past&quot;). In the issue Nikolai Rynin
published Kibalchich&#x27;s description of a manned, rocket-propelled ship, from his final letter. The letter had been filed in police archives until Rynin fished it out, after hearing rumors of the design.

In 1891, similar ideas were developed independently by the German engineer Hermann Ganswindt. After WWII, Stanislaw Ulam proposed a nuclear pulse propulsion scheme which was studied in Project ORION.

The International Astronomical Union honoured the rocketry pioneer by naming a crater on the Moon Kibalchich&#x27;s crater (Kibal&#x27;chich), which is centered at 2.72° N 147.18° W and as on the Moon&#x27;s far side. Mount Kibal&#x27;chich, which is the highest peak of the Kvaevenutane Peaks in Antarctica and was discovered by Germans during 1938-9 is also named after him.

In Korop organized a house-museum and erected a monument in honor of Nikolai Kibalchich.

<text>In computer science and artificial intelligence, combinatorial search studies search algorithms for solving instances of problems that are believed to be hard in general, by efficiently exploring the usually large solution space of these instances. Combinatorial search algorithms achieve this efficiency by reducing the effective size of the search space or employing heuristics. Some algorithms are guaranteed to find the optimal solution, while others may only return the best solution found in the part of the state space that was explored.

Classic combinatorial search problems include solving the eight queens puzzle or evaluating moves in games with a large game tree, such as reversi or chess.

A study of computational complexity theory helps to motivate combinatorial search. Combinatorial search algorithms are typically concerned with problems that are NP-hard. Such problems are not believed to be efficiently solvable in general. However, the various approximations of complexity theory suggest that some instances (e.g. &quot;small&quot; instances) of these problems could be efficiently solved. This is indeed the case, and such instances often have important practical ramifications.

== Examples ==
Common algorithms for solving combinatorial search problems include:
* A* search algorithm
* Alpha–beta pruning
* Branch-and-bound
* Minimax

== Lookahead ==
Lookahead is an important component of combinatorial search, which specifies, roughly, how deeply the graph representing the problem is explored. The need for a specific limit on lookahead comes from the large problem graphs in many applications, such as computer chess and computer Go. A naive breadth-first search of these graphs would quickly consume all the memory of any modern computer. By setting a specific lookahead limit, the algorithm&#x27;s time can be carefully controlled; its time increases exponentially as the lookahead limit increases.

More sophisticated search techniques such as alpha–beta pruning are able to eliminate entire subtrees of the search tree from consideration. When these techniques are used, lookahead is not a precisely defined quantity, but instead either the maximum depth searched or some type of average.

<doc id="207190" wikidata="Q244570" url="?curid=207190" title="Pince-nez">
<text>Pince-nez ( or , plural form same as singular; ) is a style of glasses, popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, that are supported without earpieces, by pinching the bridge of the nose. The name comes from French &quot;pincer&quot;, &quot;to pinch&quot;, and &quot;nez&quot;, &quot;nose&quot;. 
Although pince-nez were used in Europe since the late 14th century, modern ones appeared in the 1840s and reached their peak popularity around 1880 to 1900. Because they did not always stay on the nose when placed, and because of the stigma sometimes attached to the constant wearing of eyeglasses, pince-nez were often connected to the wearer&#x27;s clothing or ear via a suspension chain, cord, or ribbon so that they could be easily removed and not lost.

== Varieties ==
===Rivet spectacles===
The earliest form of eyewear for which any archaeological record exists comes from the middle of the 15th century. It is a primitive pince-nez whose frames were made from two pieces of either metacarpal bone from the forelimb of a bull or large pieces of antler. The pieces were paddle-shaped, and joined by an iron rivet which provided the tension over the nose and allowed the lenses to be folded together. The purpose of the three holes at the place where the handle connects to the hinge is uncertain, though they may have been used for pinhole vision, a principle which was known from ancient times. Each paddle was split at one end to allow for the insertion of a lens, with the split closed by a piece of copper wire in normal use. The frames were extremely light, but the tension in the rivet would have loosened over time, making them unable to stay on the nose. Paintings depicting such frames date from as early as 1392 CE.

Later frames were made from cattle horn or from wood, but always with a connecting rivet for tension.

===C-bridge===

These pince-nez have a C-shaped curved and flexible metal bridge which provides tension to clip the lenses on the wearer&#x27;s nose. They were in wide use from the 1820s to the 1940s and were available in a variety of styles, ranging from the early nose-padless type of the 19th century to the gutta-percha variety of the American Civil War era and then on to the plaquette variety of the 20th century. An advantage of this variety was that one size would fit any nose. The bridges were subject to metal fatigue from flexing when repeatedly put on and taken off, so would frequently break or lose their tension. The separation between the lenses was not fixed and might not match the user&#x27;s interpupillary distance when flexed to fit, and the lenses would rotate slightly when being placed on the nose, so that the pince-nez could not be used to correct astigmatism. The disadvantages made this type fundamentally flawed for many wearers.

===Astig=== 

The &quot;astig&quot;—named for its ability to manage astigmatism—or &quot;bar-spring&quot; pince-nez has a sliding bar and spring connecting the lenses, which can be separated by gently pulling the lenses away from each other, then placed on the bridge of the nose and released; the spring then holds the device in place. The nose pads were traditionally made of cork, were attached directly to the frames, and were either hinged or stationary. This variety was popular from the 1890s to the 1930s. They were created and marketed as &#x27;sporting pince-nez&#x27;, which were claimed to be more difficult to jar from the face than the other varieties, and more comfortable in prolonged wear. Unlike the C-bridge pince-nez, whose lenses rotated slightly as they were placed on the nose, the astig&#x27;s lenses did not rotate and consequently could correct for astigmatism, but their separation could vary and not match the user&#x27;s interpupillary distance.

===Fits-U===

In 1893 Jules Cottet, a Frenchman, developed and patented a finger-piece eyeglass whose lenses were connected by a rigid bridge, with springs in the nose-rests to clip onto the bridge of the nose. The wearer could squeeze a pair of levers located above or in front of the bridge to open the planquettes, and release them to allow them to close onto the nose. As the lenses did not rotate these devices could correct for astigmatism, and as the distance between the lenses was fixed they could be made to fit the user&#x27;s inter-pupillary spacing. Cottet registered his patent in France, England, and the United States, but did not pursue production and eventually sold the patent to a London-based eyewear manufacturer, who sold it to an American firm. The design remained unused for years, until it was acquired by American Optical, which successfully marketed it under the brand name &quot;Fits-U&quot;, quickly replacing most other pince-nez.

===Oxford spectacles===

The difference between Oxford spectacles (or &quot;Oxfords&quot; for short) and the pince-nez is not frequently drawn. The style was supposedly developed in the 19th century when a professor at Oxford University accidentally broke off the handle from a pair of lorgnette spectacles and reputedly affixed two small nose-pads to the frame and found that he could use the tension in the folding spring to perch them on his nose, though the authenticity of the story has never been verified. Oxfords are descended from the lorgnette, as early examples of them often had handles in addition to nose-pads. In style Oxfords are much like the C-bridge as the tension is provided by a flexible, sprung piece of metal; however, they also resemble the astig, as the spring connecting the two lenses is distinct from the nose-pieces. Oxfords were popular in Europe and the Americas up until the 1930s.

== In popular culture ==
Pince-nez are central to the murder mystery in the Sherlock Holmes story &quot;The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez&quot;. Another murder mystery, &quot;Whose Body?&quot; by Dorothy L. Sayers, features a victim found dead in a bathtub wearing nothing but a pair of pince-nez.

Numerous fictional characters have been depicted as wearing pince-nez. These include Hercule Poirot in the television series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;, who wears pince-nez that are attached to a cord around his neck; Morpheus in the &quot;Matrix&quot; film trilogy, who wears reflective-lensed pince-nez sunglasses when he appears in the Matrix; Don Knotts&#x27; title-character in&quot; The Incredible Mr. Limpet&quot;, who wears them both as a man and a fish; The Walt Disney cartoon character Scrooge McDuck; Professor Frost in the C. S. Lewis novel &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;, who is identified multiple times by his wearing a pair of pince-nez; Koroviev/Fagott, a member of Satan&#x27;s entourage in Mikhail Bulgakov&#x27;s &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;; Mr. Borgin in &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;; Roger Swindon in &quot;Under Wildwood&quot;, the second novel in Colin Meloy&#x27;s &quot;Wildwood&quot; trilogy; the dastardly villain Dr. Eggman/Robotnik from Sonic the Hedgehog; and Mordecai Heller in Tracy J. Butler&#x27;s &quot;Lackadaisy&quot; and the &quot;Lackadaisy&quot; short film.

In the piece &quot;Son binocle&quot; from his piano suite &quot;Les trois valses distinguées du précieux dégoûté&quot; (1914), Erik Satie depicts a jaded dandy cleaning his luxurious pince-nez, which is made from solid gold and smoked glass. Satie himself was a lifelong wearer of pince-nez.

Throughout Arthur Koestler&#x27;s &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; reference is made to the fact that the main character, Rubashov, wears pince-nez and uses them to tap on the pipes in his cell to communicate with fellow prisoners. In Darkness at Noon the pince-nez signifies Rubashov&#x27;s belonging to the intelligentsia where a fellow prisoners monocle represents their belonging to the aristocracy.

Gomez Addams (&quot;The Addams Family&quot;) frequently pulled a pair of pince-nez glasses from his inside left jacket pocket including a reference to the spectacles by Doctor Motley in Season 2, Episode 18, &quot;Fester Goes on a Diet.&quot; 

The Irish poet W. B. Yeats is also frequently depicted wearing pince-nez.

The United States Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt frequently wore pince-nez and were regularly depicted as such.

The prominent Spanish poet Francisco de Quevedo always wore pince-nez, and was depicted wearing them in well-known paintings such as a portrait by Juan van der Hamen. Pince-nez are so characteristic of Quevedo that they came to be named &quot;quevedos&quot; in Spanish.

<doc id="207193" wikidata="Q16015745" url="?curid=207193" title="David Bloom">
<text>David Jerome Bloom (May 22, 1963 – April 6, 2003) was an American television journalist (co-anchor of &quot;Weekend Today&quot; and reporter) until his sudden death in 2003 after a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) became a pulmonary embolism at the age of 39.

==Early life==
David Bloom was born in Edina, Minnesota, the son of Laura Jean (née Carmichael) and Harold James Bloom. He was an avid ice hockey player and state champion in high school debating in the National Forensic League. Bloom attended Pitzer College in Claremont, California, from 1981 to 1985, where he majored in political science.

In 1985, Bloom was ranked top in the nation for intercollegiate policy debate. He and his partner, Greg Mastel, were ranked the top debate team in the nation before entering the National Debate Tournament of 1985. They lost in quarter-finals to Loyola Marymount.

==Professional career==
He began his television career at WKBT-TV in La Crosse, Wisconsin, covering local government stories. Bloom worked as a general assignment reporter at KWCH-TV in Wichita, Kansas from 1988 to 1989.

In 1989, Bloom joined NBC&#x27;s WTVJ in Miami. He covered Hurricane Andrew and while reporting the aftermath he chased off would-be looters. In 1991, he won a regional Emmy for investigative journalism for his report on South Florida&#x27;s role in the shipment of arms to Iraq. He received the Peabody Award and was awarded the Edward R. Murrow Award by the Radio-Television News Directors Association for his hurricane coverage.

In 1993, Bloom joined NBC News as correspondent in Chicago, Illinois, and moved to Los Angeles, California in 1995. Bloom covered the presidential campaigns of 1996 and 2000 for the network and in 1997 became NBC&#x27;s White House correspondent. Former President Clinton said that Bloom&#x27;s &quot;integrity and good humor will be missed.&quot;

During his tenure with NBC, Bloom reported on major stories including presidential races, the September 11 attacks, the Washington-area sniper shootings, and the war in Bosnia. According to the late Tim Russert, former NBC Washington bureau chief, &quot;You couldn&#x27;t keep him away from a story. Whenever something was breaking, he wanted to be there.&quot; In March 2000, Bloom became co-anchor of &quot;Weekend Today&quot; along with Soledad O&#x27;Brien, a position in which he served until his death.

==Iraq reporting and death==

On April 6, 2003, Bloom was traveling with the U.S. Third Infantry Division in Iraq while covering the Iraq War in a vehicle pegged after his name, the &quot;Bloom Mobile.&quot; It was a Ford F250 4 wheel drive Flatbed truck retrofitted with live television and satellite transmission equipment so he could continuously broadcast reports as troops made their way toward Baghdad. Reporting live, round-the-clock, as the American armored column fought north across the desert toward Baghdad, Bloom commented offhandedly on the cramped conditions, excessive heat and lack of sleep that came with the mission.

He had been on assignment in Iraq for several weeks when a blood clot in his leg (deep vein thrombosis) traveled to an artery in his lungs, causing a fatal pulmonary embolism. &quot;The clot in Bloom&#x27;s leg was likely brought on by spending long days and nights cramped inside armored vehicles. One night he called Melanie from a satellite phone in the middle of the night, exposing himself to hostile fire just to get a few minutes outside of an armored tank because his legs had been cramping up.&quot;

==Personal life==
Bloom was survived by his wife, Melanie, and three daughters: Nicole, Christine, and Ava. The Blooms were residents of Pound Ridge, New York at the time of his death. After his death, his widow began working with the &quot;Coalition to Prevent DVT&quot; and remarried to Daniel McNulty in 2008.

==The David Bloom Award==
In 2006 The National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters established an award to honor excellence in enterprise reporting. ABC &quot;World News Tonight&quot; co-anchor Bob Woodruff received the award in its first year.

<doc id="207199" wikidata="Q5763774" url="?curid=207199" title="Hillsdale College">
<text>Hillsdale College is a private, conservative, Christian liberal arts college in Hillsdale, Michigan, United States. It was founded in 1844 by members of the Free Will Baptists. Women were admitted to the college in 1844, making the college the second-oldest coeducational educational institution in the United States. Hillsdale&#x27;s required core curriculum includes courses on the Great Books, the U.S. Constitution, biology, chemistry, and physics. 

Since the late 20th century, in order to opt out of the US government&#x27;s Title IX requirements, Hillsdale has declined government financial support. Instead, Hillsdale depends entirely on private donations to supplement students&#x27; tuition.

Hillsdale no longer has any denominational affiliation but, according to its website, &quot;the moral tenets of Christianity as commonly understood in the Christian tradition have been essential to the mission of the College&quot;.

==History==
===Founding===

Members of the Free Will Baptist Church founded their denomination&#x27;s first collegiate institution, Michigan Central College in Spring Arbor, Michigan, in 1844. The state of Michigan incorporated the college the following year, during which the college enrolled 25 undergraduates. The college was officially non-sectarian. Its first president was Daniel McBride Graham, who held the office from 1844 to 1848.

Edmund Burke Fairfield assumed the school&#x27;s presidency in 1848, and in 1850 the college was chartered to confer degrees. Black students were admitted immediately after the college&#x27;s founding, and the college became the second school in the nation to grant four-year liberal arts degrees to women.

Outgrowing its space, in 1853 the school moved to Hillsdale, Michigan, in part to have access to the railroad that served the city. It received financial support from residents who wanted to develop the 20-year-old town. Construction was completed and the school reopened as Hillsdale College in 1855.

Fairfield led Hillsdale from 1848 to 1869. In 1854, he attended the first convention of the new Republican Party with Ransom Dunn in neighboring Jackson, Michigan. Fairfield was elected lieutenant governor of Michigan. Hillsdale&#x27;s early anti-slavery reputation and pivotal role in founding the Republican Party led to the invitation of several notable speakers on the campus, including Frederick Douglass (who visited the school on two occasions) and Edward Everett, the orator who preceded Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg. On August 8, 1860, Hillsdale conferred its first degrees. On March 20, 1863, the Michigan legislature formally legalized Hillsdale&#x27;s change of name and location.

===19th century===
In 1861, many Hillsdale students joined the ranks of the Union Army during the American Civil War; a higher percentage of Hillsdale students enlisted than from any other Michigan college.

In 1869, James Calder succeeded Fairfield as president. Calder served through 1871. During his administration, the commercial school opened, a theological department was established, and the college enrolled around 750 students. He resigned to become president of Pennsylvania State University.Hillsdale&#x27;s first president, Daniel McBride Graham, returned for a brief second term in 1871, notably rebuilding the campus after the catastrophic &quot;Great Fire&quot; of March 6, 1874. DeWitt Clinton Durgin, a Union College alumnus, was president from 1874 to 1884. In 1878, the &quot;Hillsdale Herald&quot; was published, becoming the second oldest college newspaper in Michigan, behind Kalamazoo College&#x27;s &quot;The Index&quot;. This paper later merged with another college paper to become &quot;The Collegian&quot;. In 1884, Spencer O. Fisher became the first Hillsdale alumnus elected to Congress.

George F. Mosher served as president of Hillsdale from 1886 to 1901. During this time, the college grew in size and in 1891, the &quot;Chicago Herald&quot; wrote, &quot;Hillsdale has a college second in standing to no denominational college in the country.&quot;

===20th century===

In 1900, Hillsdale ceased grazing livestock and removed the agrarian fence circling the campus. It began an era of institutional growth and professionalization. In 1902, Joseph William Mauck became the college&#x27;s sixth president, the first Hillsdale graduate to return as president of his alma mater. Beloved by the college community and an early and outspoken advocate for women&#x27;s suffrage, Mauck served for two decades. One of the women&#x27;s dormitories is named after Mauck. In 1907, the college amended its Articles of Association, no longer requiring the president and trustees to be Free Will Baptists. This led to a decline in the theological department&#x27;s prestige but an increase in the number of Christian denominations represented on campus.

William Gear Spencer succeeded Mauck as president, serving from 1922 to 1932, when he departed to lead Franklin College. Under Spencer, Hillsdale acquired its 14-acre Slayton Arboretum, built new dormitories, constructed a new field house for its developing athletic programs, and, in 1924, chartered its chapter of Chi Omega.
During the Great Depression, Willfred Otto Mauck, Joseph Mauck&#x27;s son and also an alumnus, was selected as the eighth president, serving from 1933 to 1942. Throughout this era, the college struggled financially, was forced to cancel its new construction projects, and cut the pay of its faculty and staff by nearly 20%. Succeeding Mauck, Harvey L. Turner became Hillsdale&#x27;s ninth president, serving from 1942 to 1952. Despite its financial difficulties, the college built a new library, had an undefeated and untied football team in 1938, and celebrated its centennial in 1944, when more than 1,000 alumni returned to campus for the commencement ceremony.

J. Donald Phillips next assumed the presidency, holding the position from 1952 to 1971. During his administration, Hillsdale constructed the Simpson and McIntyre Student Residences in 1966. In these years, Hillsdale began to resist federal civil rights regulations, particularly concerning affirmative action, enacted in the 1960s. In 1962, the college&#x27;s trustees adopted its own &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot;. It affirmed Hillsdale&#x27;s stance against what it called governmental control.A marker designating the college as a Michigan Historic Site was erected by the Michigan Historical Commission in 1968.

George Roche III became the 11th president of Hillsdale College in 1971. During the Roche years, Hillsdale became nationally known, in part because of its withdrawal from federal and state-assisted loan programs and grants. Colleges that receive federal funding are required by law to report data on racial integration as part of the US affirmative action student loan program. Hillsdale announced that it refused to do so, and the college&#x27;s trustees instead stated that the institution would follow its own non-discrimination policy and &quot;with the help of God, resist, by all legal means, any encroachments on its independence.&quot;

During Roche&#x27;s presidency, the college dramatically increased its endowment, established the Center for Constructive Alternatives, and hosted prominent national speakers, including Ronald Reagan. It also began publishing &quot;Imprimis&quot;, a monthly speech digest. Russell Kirk taught at Hillsdale for one semester per year beginning in 1973.

Roche resigned his position at Hillsdale in late 1999 following a scandal surrounding the death by suicide of his son&#x27;s wife, Lissa Jackson Roche, in the Slayton Arboretum on October 17, 1999. Hours prior to her suicide, Roche stated that she and her father-in-law had engaged in an on-and-off 19-year sexual affair. Married to Roche&#x27;s son, Hillsdale Professor of History George Roche IV, Jackson Roche had been employed as managing editor of Hillsdale College Press for 14 years. President Roche denied the alleged affair, but was suspended by the College on November 1 and resigned his post on November 10. Due to Jackson Roche&#x27;s suicide and the ensuing scandal, the college&#x27;s reputation suffered.

===21st century===
Larry P. Arnn has served as president of the college since 2000. Hillsdale&#x27;s K–12 Initiative developed a full liberal arts K–12 curriculum for use in the charter schools and its private school in Michigan, Hillsdale Academy. In 2021, Hillsdale K–12 released a Civics &quot;1776 Curriculum.&quot; In 2022, Hillsdale had schools following its K–12 liberal arts curriculum across 19 states and Barney Charter Schools in 9 states.

After several decades of maintaining a semester program in Washington D.C., Hillsdale established a permanent presence with the establishment of the Allan P. Kirby, Jr. Center for Constitutional Studies and Citizenship on Massachusetts Avenue. The facility was dedicated on Constitution Day 2010. Ginni Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, ran the Washington center&#x27;s speaker series at this time. In 2015, the Boyle Radio Studio at the Kirby Center was dedicated.In 2012, Hillsdale founded the Van Andel Graduate School for Statesmanship on its Michigan campus offering both an M.A. and PhD in Politics. Its first M.A. students graduated in 2014, and its first PhD students graduated in 2018. In 2020, Hillsdale founded the Van Andel Graduate School of Government on its DC campus offering an M.A. in Government. In 2022, Hillsdale founded its Graduate School of Classical Education offering an M.A. in Classical Education.

In 2013, Arnn was criticized for remarks about ethnic minorities he made while testifying before the Michigan legislature against the Common Core curriculum standards. Expressing concern about government interference with educational institutions, he noted having received a letter from the state Department of Education early in his presidency that said his college &quot;violated the standards for diversity.&quot; He added, &quot;because we didn&#x27;t have enough dark ones, I guess, is what they meant.&quot; After being criticized for calling minorities &quot;dark ones,&quot; Arnn explained that he was referring to &quot;dark faces&quot;. He stated: &quot;The State of Michigan sent a group of people down to my campus, with clipboards ... to look at the colors of people&#x27;s faces and write down what they saw. We don&#x27;t keep records of that information. What were they looking for besides dark ones?&quot; Michigan House Democratic Leader Tim Greimel condemned Arnn&#x27;s comments, calling them &quot;offensive&quot;, &quot;inflammatory and bigoted&quot;, and asked for an apology. In response, the college issued a statement apologizing for Arnn&#x27;s remark, while reiterating his concern about &quot;state-endorsed racism&quot;, as Arnn called affirmative action.

In 2019, S. Prestley Blake donated his former home, an exact replica of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Monticello, in Somers, Connecticut to Hillsdale College. In May 2021, Hillsdale dedicated the property as the Blake Center for Faith and Freedom. In November 2021, Hillsdale purchased land in Placer County, California for nearly $6M with plans for a new educational center.

The college is at the center of a political dispute about the K12 education, since it regards &quot;history as politics by other means&quot;.

In October 2023, two female students sued the college after reporting instances of sexual assault from male students. They accused the college of performing &quot;phony investigations&quot; and then blaming them &quot;for being raped&quot;. The lawsuit points to Hillsdale&#x27;s policy of not accepting government funding &quot;to avoid its obligations under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972&quot;, and accuses the school of putting its students at an &quot;unusually high risk of sexual assault because Hillsdale fails to have or enforce policies that prevent sexual assault&quot;. This lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice by U.S. District Judge Jane Beckering in September 2024.

Hillsdale College is a member of the advisory board of Project 2025, a collection of conservative and right-wing policy proposals from the Heritage Foundation to reshape the United States federal government and consolidate executive power since Trump won the 2024 presidential election.

==Campus==
Hillsdale&#x27;s campus contains multiple instructional and office buildings, 13 residence halls, seven fraternity and sorority houses, an athletic complex, a library, a music hall, an arts center, a conference center, a hotel, and a preschool. Hillsdale College also operates Hillsdale Academy, a private K–12 liberal arts school. The college opened the classical-style Christ Chapel in 2019, in a dedication ceremony led by Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas.

The campus features the Liberty Walk, a walkway lined with bronze depictions of famous politicians including George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher, and Ronald Reagan.

==Policies and funding==
In the early 1980s, a controversy over the school&#x27;s admissions practices threatened federal student loans to 200 Hillsdale students. Title IX prohibits sex-based discrimination in any school or other education program that receives federal money. The federal government required colleges where students received federal funding to document their compliance with Title IX, but Hillsdale refused, arguing that the government could not deny federal funds to its students because the college received no direct federal funding and there was no allegation of actual sex discrimination. The Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) sought to terminate federal financial assistance to Hillsdale&#x27;s students; an Administrative Law Judge denied HEW&#x27;s request in 1978, and both HEW and Hillsdale appealed to HEW&#x27;s Civil Rights Reviewing Authority.

In October 1979, the Reviewing Authority rejected Hillsdale&#x27;s arguments and the ALJ&#x27;s decision, ruling that HEW could require Hillsdale to sign the Assurance of Compliance as a condition of its students receiving federal financial assistance. The college appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit; in 1982, the Sixth Circuit ruled that government aid to individual students could be terminated without a finding that a college actually discriminated, but nevertheless upheld Hillsdale&#x27;s refusal to sign the compliance forms because only its student loan and grant program is subject to Title IX regulation, not the entire college.

In the related 1984 case &quot;Grove City College v. Bell&quot;, the Supreme Court required every college or university to fulfill federal requirementspast and future requirementsif its students received federal aid. As a result of the decision, Hillsdale withdrew from all federal assistance beginning with the 1984–5 academic year; Grove City College, the plaintiff in that case, followed Hillsdale&#x27;s lead four years later. Beginning in the 2007–8 academic year, Hillsdale stopped accepting Michigan state assistance, instead matching with its own aid any funds that a student would have received from the state. Since 2007, Hillsdale&#x27;s entire operating budget, including scholarships, has come from private funding and endowments. Right wing conservative billionaire Timothy Mellon supports Hillsdale College; In 2016, he offered donations to the college for each download of his autobiography.

==Programs==
===The Blake Center for Faith and Freedom===
In 2019, S. Prestley Blake donated his estate in Somers, Connecticut, to the college. Following a lengthy battle over zoning issues, the college has turned the estate into The Blake Center for Faith and Freedom. The center includes a replica of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Monticello.

===Academy for Science and Freedom===
In December 2021, Hillsdale launched the Academy for Science and Freedom in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The academy&#x27;s stated goal is to &quot;educate the American people about the free exchange of scientific ideas and the proper relationship between freedom and science in the pursuit of truth&quot;. The academy called the United States&#x27; response to the COVID-19 pandemic &quot;the worst public health fiasco in history&quot; that &quot;has unveiled serious issues with how science is administered&quot;. Scott Atlas, Jay Bhattacharya, and Martin Kulldorff, who helped found the academy, have ties to the Great Barrington Declaration.

<doc id="207202" wikidata="Q7601040" url="?curid=207202" title="Star Trek Generations (video game)">
<text>Star Trek Generations is a 1997 first-person shooter with adventure and strategy elements by MicroProse, based on &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; (1994), the seventh film in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; film franchise. It includes voice-acting by much of the cast of the film including actors Patrick Stewart, William Shatner, and Malcolm McDowell, as well as footage from the film. 

==Story==
The plot of the game is similar to that of the film: Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D responds to a distress call from the Amargosa Observatory and Commander William Riker is sent over to investigate. Once there, he finds Dr. Tolian Soran, a scientist and madman hell bent on returning to the Nexus, a paradise dimension.

Soran escapes and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; goes on various missions to try to find him. To return to the Nexus, Soran intends on destroying stars in order to cause the Nexus (due to loss of the stars&#x27; gravity) to pass near Veridian III. The player needs to guess which planets Soran intends to destroy in order to pursue him.

Apart from being based on the film, the game is also related to &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation – A Final Unity&quot;, since the aliens from that game, the Chodak, make an appearance. The overall science fiction universe of these titles is based on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, a television show that aired between 1987 and 1994, itself developed from the earlier &quot;Star Trek&quot; show of the late 1960s.

==Gameplay==
The game combines several video game genres, and follows the main non-linear philosophy of alternate paths to complete the game, followed in other Star Trek games.

The major portion of the game occurs in Stellar Cartography (also appearing in the film, although only for some minutes) where the player plans their next moves, the main opponents being time and Soran. This part of the game includes the strategic part where the player has to calculate and guess where Soran could be, in order to travel there and stop him before he destroys the system.

When a crew member beams to a planet or space station, the game switches to first-person action/adventure. The main objective of every away mission is finding and fighting with Soran, who beams away seconds before being killed by the player. The mission is then successful; however, not all away missions need to be successful to win the game.

Enemy ships are encountered while in space. The game then switches to pure tactical/simulator where the player controls the &quot;Enterprise&quot; against the enemy ship(s). The fighting system is simplified over the extremely difficult tactical part of &quot;A Final Unity&quot;.

==Development==
Producer Simon Finch explained the game&#x27;s storytelling philosophy: &quot;We were trying to put the player into the situation that the characters were in the movie &quot;Generations&quot;, but we wanted to let them do what they wanted to do, and have the situations deviate fairly far from the film.&quot; Concerning the gameplay style, he commented, &quot;We definitely wanted to teach players that violence isn&#x27;t always the right solution, but we never wanted to water down gameplay by taking that option away from them.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; received mediocre reviews. Most critics said that while the away missions are interesting, particularly their puzzle elements, the stellar cartography and space combat portions are dull, though Vince Broady defended the space combat in a 2000 review of the game for &quot;GameSpot&quot;, contending that &quot;this combat system is the best yet in a &quot;Star Trek&quot; game, and it provides a welcome respite from the drudgery of Stellar Cartography.&quot; Critics unanimously agreed that the inability to save in the middle of a mission was ill-considered and frustrating. Other common criticisms were that the controls are needlessly confusing and the graphics are primitive by contemporary standards. Critics did praise the use of sounds that were authentic to the film, such as the theme music and voice acting by Patrick Stewart and Malcolm McDowell.

&quot;GamePro&quot; took an optimistic look, summarizing that &quot;While some significant flaws crop up, Generations still delivers a fun but mellow puzzle/adventure experience.&quot; Most reviewers, however, concluded that the game was not strong enough to appeal to anyone but Trekkies. Bonnie James of &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; also speculated that &quot;&quot;Star Trek: Generations&quot; may have a difficult time being taken seriously as a cutting edge game due to the fact that it has appeared so long after the release of the film. In fact, there has been another Star Trek film released in the meantime [&quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;].&quot;

<text>Mount Mitchell (&quot;Attakulla&quot; in Cherokee) is the highest peak of the Appalachian Mountains and the highest peak in mainland North America east of the Mississippi River. It is located near Burnsville in Yancey County, North Carolina in the Black Mountain subrange of the Appalachians about northeast of Asheville. It is protected by Mount Mitchell State Park and surrounded by the Pisgah National Forest. Mount Mitchell&#x27;s elevation is above sea level. Mount Mitchell is ranked 31st by topographic isolation.

==Geography==
The peak is the highest mountain in the United States east of the Mississippi River, and the highest in all of eastern North America south of the Arctic Cordillera. The nearest higher peaks are in the Black Hills of South Dakota and the highland foothills of Colorado. The mountain&#x27;s topographic isolation is calculated from the nearest discernible single higher point: Lone Butte, which is 1,189 miles (1,913 km) away in southeastern Colorado.

==History==
Mount Mitchell was the highest mountain of the United States from 1789 until the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 when Mount Elbert became the highest mountain claimed by the United States. Mount Mitchell was also the most isolated peak in the United States from 1789 until the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 when Mount Whitney became the most isolated.
The Cherokee people, who long occupied this area as part of their homeland, called the mountain &quot;Attakulla.&quot; European-American settlers first called the mountain Black Dome for its rounded shape. They later named it after Elisha Mitchell, a professor at the University of North Carolina, who first explored the Black Mountain region in 1835. He determined that the height of the range exceeded by several hundred feet that of Mount Washington in New Hampshire. The latter had been commonly thought at the time to be the highest point in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. Mitchell fell to his death at nearby Mitchell Falls in 1857, where he had returned to verify his earlier measurements.
A road (NC 128) connects the scenic Blue Ridge Parkway to a parking lot where a steep paved trail leads through a conifer forest to the summit. The stone observation tower on the summit was torn down in late 2006. A new observation deck was constructed and opened to visitors in January 2009.

==Description==
Mount Mitchell was formed during the Precambrian when marine deposits were metamorphosed into gneiss and schist. These metasedimentary rocks were later uplifted during the Alleghenian orogeny. The soils are well drained, dark brown and stony with fine-earth material ranging in texture from sandy clay loam to loam or sandy loam; Burton and Craggey are the most common series around the summit.

==Environment==
The mountain&#x27;s summit is coated in a dense stand of Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest, which consists primarily of two evergreen species—the red spruce and the Fraser fir. Most of the mature Fraser firs, however, were killed off by the non-native Balsam woolly adelgid in the latter half of the 20th century. The high elevations expose plant life to high levels of pollution, including acid precipitation in the form of rain, snow, and fog. These acids damage the red spruce trees in part by releasing natural metals from the soil, such as aluminum, and by leaching important minerals. To what extent this pollution harms the high-altitude ecosystem is debatable.

While the mountain is still mostly lush and green in the summer, many dead Fraser fir trunks can be seen due to these serious problems. Reducing air pollution is a difficult issue, as the pollutants are often carried by air to this area from long distances. Sources can be local or hundreds of miles away, requiring cooperation from as far away as the Midwest.

Wildflowers are abundant all summer long. Young fir and spruce trees do well in the subalpine climate, and their cones feed the birds along with wild blueberry and blackberry shrubs.

The second highest point in eastern North America, Mount Craig at , is roughly a mile to the north of Mount Mitchell.

===Climate===

The summit area of Mount Mitchell is marked by a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;), with mild summers and long, moderately cold winters, being more similar to southeastern Canada than the southeastern U.S. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from in January to in July. The coldest temperature ever recorded in the state occurred there on January 21, 1985, when it fell to , during a severe cold spell. It is also the coldest average reporting station in the state at , well below any other station.

Unlike the lower elevations in the surrounding regions, heavy snows often fall from December to March, with accumulating in the Great Blizzard of 1993 and in the January 2016 blizzard. Due to the high elevation, precipitation is heavy and reliable year-round, averaging for the year, with no month receiving less than of average precipitation. The summit is often windy, with recorded gusts of up to .

Mount Mitchell recorded a new state record of of precipitation in 2018, which is also the highest total rainfall recorded during a calendar year anywhere east of the Cascade Range in the Contiguous United States.

<doc id="207211" wikidata="Q927198" url="?curid=207211" title="Londinium">
<text>Londinium, also known as Roman London, was the capital of Roman Britain during most of the period of Roman rule. Most twenty-first century historians think that it was originally a settlement established shortly after the Claudian invasion of Britain, on the current site of the City of London, around 47–50 AD, but some defend an older view that the city originated in a defensive enclosure constructed during the Claudian invasion in 43 AD. Its earliest securely-dated structure is a timber drain of 47 AD. It sat at a key ford at the River Thames which turned the city into a road nexus and major port (which was built between 49 and 52 AD), serving as a major commercial centre in Roman Britain until its abandonment during the 5th century.

Following the foundation of the town in the mid-1st century, early Londinium occupied the relatively small area of , roughly half the area of the modern City of London and equivalent to the size of present-day Hyde Park. In 60 or 61 AD, the rebellion of the Iceni under their queen, Boudica, compelled the Roman forces to abandon the settlement, which was then razed. Following the defeat of Boudica by the Roman governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus a military installation was established, and the city was rebuilt. It had probably largely recovered within about a decade. During the later decades of the 1st century, Londinium expanded rapidly, becoming Britannia&#x27;s largest city, and it was provided with large public buildings such as a forum and amphitheatre. By the 2nd century, Londinium had grown to perhaps 30,000 or 60,000 people, almost certainly replacing Camulodunum (Colchester) as the provincial capital, and by the mid-2nd century Londinium was at its height. Its forum basilica was one of the largest structures north of the Alps when Emperor Hadrian visited Londinium in 122. Excavations have discovered evidence of a major fire that destroyed much of the city shortly thereafter, but the city was again rebuilt. By the second half of the 2nd century, Londinium appears to have shrunk in both size and population.

Although Londinium remained important for the rest of the Roman period, no further expansion resulted. Londinium supported a smaller but stable settlement population as archaeologists have found that much of the city after this date was covered in dark earth—the by-product of urban household waste, manure, ceramic tile, and non-farm debris of settlement occupation, which accumulated relatively undisturbed for centuries. Some time between 190 and 225, the Romans built a defensive wall around the landward side of the city. The London Wall survived for another 1,600 years and broadly defined the perimeter of the old City of London.

== Name ==
The etymology of the name &quot;Londinium&quot; is unknown. Following Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s pseudohistorical &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;, it was long published as derived from an eponymous founder named Lud, son of Heli. There is no evidence such a figure existed. Instead, the Latin name was probably based on a native Brittonic place name reconstructed as *&quot;Londinion&quot;. Morphologically, this points to a structure of two suffixes: &quot;-in-jo-&quot;. However, the Roman &quot;Londinium&quot; was not the immediate source of English &quot;London&quot; (), as &quot;i&quot;-mutation would have caused the name to have been &quot;Lyndon&quot;. This suggests an alternative Brittonic form &quot;Londonion&quot;; alternatively, the local pronunciation in British Latin may have changed the pronunciation of &quot;Londinium&quot; to &quot;Lundeiniu&quot; or &quot;Lundein&quot;, which would also have avoided &quot;i&quot;-mutation in Old English. The list of the 28 Cities of Britain included in the 9th-century &quot;History of the Britons&quot; precisely notes London in Old Welsh as &quot;Cair Lundem&quot; or &quot;Lundein&quot;.

The pronunciation of &quot;Londinium&quot; in English is , and its pronunciation in Classical Latin is .

== Location ==

The site guarded the Romans&#x27; bridgehead on the north bank of the Thames and a major road nexus shortly after the invasion. It was centred on Cornhill and the River Walbrook, but extended west to Ludgate Hill and east to Tower Hill. Just prior to the Roman conquest, the area had been contested by the Catuvellauni based to the west and the Trinovantes based to the east; it bordered the realm of the Cantiaci on the south bank of the Thames.

The Roman city ultimately covered at least the area of the City of London, whose boundaries are largely defined by its former wall. Londinium&#x27;s waterfront on the Thames ran from around Ludgate Hill in the west to the present site of the Tower in the east, around . The northern wall reached Bishopsgate and Cripplegate near the former site of the Museum of London, a course now marked by the street &quot;London Wall&quot;. Cemeteries and suburbs existed outside the city proper. A round temple has been located west of the city, although its dedication remains unclear.

Substantial suburbs existed at St Martin-in-the-Fields in Westminster and around the southern end of the Thames bridge in Southwark, where excavations in 1988 and 2021 have revealed an elaborate building with fine mosaics and frescoed walls dating from 72 AD. Inscriptions suggest a temple of Isis was located there.

== Status ==

Londinium grew up as a &quot;vicus&quot; and soon became an important port for trade between Roman Britain and the Roman provinces on the continent. Tacitus wrote that at the time of the uprising of Boudica, &quot;Londinium... though undistinguished by the name of &#x27;colony&#x27;, was much frequented by a number of merchants and trading vessels.&quot;

Depending on the time of its creation, the modesty of Londinium&#x27;s first forum may have reflected its early elevation to city () status or may have reflected an administrative concession to a low-ranking but major Romano-British settlement. It had almost certainly been granted colony () status prior to the complete replanning of the city&#x27;s street plan attending the erection of the great second forum around the year 120.

By this time, Britain&#x27;s provincial administration had also almost certainly been moved to Londinium from Camulodunum (now Colchester in Essex). The precise date of this change is unknown, and no surviving source explicitly states that Londinium was &quot;the capital of Britain,&quot; but there are several strong indications of this status: 2nd-century roofing tiles have been found marked by the &quot;Procurator&quot; or &quot;Publican of the Province of Britain at Londinium&quot;, the remains of a governor&#x27;s palace and tombstones belonging to the governor&#x27;s staff have been discovered, and the city was well defended and armed, with a new military camp erected at the beginning of the 2nd century in a fort on the north-western edge of the city, despite being far from any frontier. Despite some corruption to the text, the list of bishops for the 314 Council of Arles indicates that either Restitutus or Adelphius came from Londinium. The city seems to have been the seat of the diocesan vicar and one of the provincial governors following the Diocletian Reforms around 300; it had been renamed Augusta—a common epithet of provincial capitals—by 368.

== History ==
=== Founding ===
Unlike many cities of Roman Britain, Londinium was not placed on the site of a native settlement or &quot;oppidum&quot;. Prior to the arrival of the Roman legions, the area was almost certainly lightly rolling open countryside traversed by numerous streams now underground. Ptolemy lists it as one of the cities of the Cantiaci, but Durovernum (Roman Canterbury) was their tribal capital (). It is possible that the town was preceded by a short-lived Roman military camp, but the evidence is limited and this topic remains a matter of debate.

Archaeologist Lacey Wallace notes &quot;Because no LPRIA settlements or significant domestic refuse have been found in London, despite extensive archaeological excavation, arguments for a purely Roman foundation of London are now common and uncontroversial.&quot; The city&#x27;s Latin name seems to have derived from an originally Brittonic one and significant pre-Roman finds in the Thames, especially the Battersea Shield (Chelsea Bridge, perhaps 4th-century BC) and the Wandsworth Shield (perhaps 1st-century BC), both assumed to be votive offerings deposited a couple of miles upstream of Londinium, suggest the general area was busy and significant. It has been suggested that the area was where several territories intersected. There was probably a ford in that part of the river; other Roman and Celtic finds suggest this was perhaps where the opposed crossing Julius Caesar describes in 54 BC took place.

Londinium expanded around the point on the River Thames narrow enough for the construction of a Roman bridge but still deep enough to handle the era&#x27;s seagoing ships. Its placement on the Tideway permitted easier access for ships sailing upstream. The remains of a massive pier base for such a bridge were found in 1981 close by the modern London Bridge.

Some Claudian-era camp ditches have been discovered, but archaeological excavations undertaken since the 1970s by the Department of Urban Archaeology at the Museum of London (now MOLAS) have suggested the early settlement was largely the product of private enterprise. A timber drain by the side of the main Roman road excavated at No 1 Poultry has been dated by dendrochronology to 47 AD.

Following its foundation in the mid-1st century, early Roman London occupied a relatively small area, about or roughly the area of present-day Hyde Park. Archaeologists have uncovered numerous goods imported from across the Roman Empire in this period, suggesting that early Roman London was a highly cosmopolitan community of merchants from across the empire and that local markets existed for such objects.

=== Roads ===
Of the fifteen British routes recorded in the 2nd- or 3rd-century Antonine Itinerary, seven ran to or from Londinium. Most of these were constructed near the time of the city&#x27;s foundation around 47 AD. The roads are now known by Welsh or Old English names, as their original Roman names have been lost because of the lack of written and inscribed sources. (It was customary elsewhere to name roads after the emperor during whose principate they were completed, but the number and vicinity of routes completed during the time of Claudius would seem to have made this impractical in Britain&#x27;s case.)

The road from the Kentish ports of Rutupiae (Richborough), Dubris (Dover), and Lemanis (Lympne) via Durovernum (Canterbury) seems to have first crossed the Thames at a natural ford near Westminster before being diverted north to the new bridge at London. The Romans enabled the road to cross the marshy terrain without subsidence by laying down substrates of one to three layers of oak logs. This route, now known as Watling Street, passed through the town from the bridgehead in a straight line to reconnect with its northern extension towards Viroconium (Wroxeter) and the legionary base at Deva Victrix (Chester). The Great Road ran northeast across Old Ford to Camulodunum (Colchester) and thence northeast along Pye Road to Venta Icenorum (Caistor St Edmund). Ermine Street ran north from the city to Lindum (Lincoln) and Eboracum (York). The Devil&#x27;s Highway connected Londinium to Calleva (Silchester) and its roads to points west over the bridges near modern Staines. A minor road led southwest to the city&#x27;s main cemetery and the old routes to the ford at Westminster. Stane Street to Noviomagus (Chichester) did not reach Londinium proper but ran from the bridgehead in the southern suburb at Southwark. These roads varied from wide.

After its reconstruction in the 60s AD, the streets largely adhered to a grid. The main streets were wide, while side streets were usually about wide.

=== Boudica ===
In 60 or 61 AD, a little more than ten years after Londinium was founded, the king of the Iceni died. He had possibly been installed by the Romans after the Iceni&#x27;s failed revolt against Publius Ostorius Scapula&#x27;s disarmament of the allied tribes in 47 or may have assisted the Romans against his tribesmen during that revolt. His will had divided his wealth and lands between Rome and his two daughters, but Roman law forbade female inheritance and it had become common practice to treat allied kingdoms as life estates that were annexed upon the ruler&#x27;s death, as had occurred in Bithynia and Galatia. Roman financiers including Seneca called in all the king&#x27;s outstanding loans at once and the provincial procurator confiscated the property of both the king and his nobles. Tacitus records that when the king&#x27;s wife Boudica objected, the Romans flogged her, raped her two daughters, and enslaved their nobles and kinsmen. Boudica then led a failed revolt against Roman rule.

Two hundred ill-equipped men were sent to defend the provincial capital and Roman colony at Camulodunum, probably from the garrison at Londinium. The Iceni and their allies overwhelmed them and razed the city. The 9th Legion under Quintus Petillius Cerialis, coming south from the Fosse Way, was ambushed and annihilated. The procurator Catus Decianus, meanwhile, escaped with his treasure to Gaul, probably via Londinium. Gaius Suetonius Paulinus had been leading the 14th and 20th Legions in the Roman conquest of Anglesey; hearing of the rising, he immediately returned along Watling Street with the legions&#x27; cavalry. An early historical record of London appears in Tacitus&#x27;s account of his actions upon arriving and finding the state of the 9th Legion:
At first, [Paulinus] hesitated as to whether to stand and fight there. Eventually, his numerical inferiority—and the price only too clearly paid by the divisional commander&#x27;s rashness—decided him to sacrifice the single city of Londinium to save the province as a whole. Unmoved by lamentations and appeals, Suetonius gave the signal for departure. The inhabitants were allowed to accompany him. But those who stayed because they were women, or old, or attached to the place, were slaughtered by the enemy.
Excavation has revealed extensive evidence of destruction by fire in the form of a layer of red ash beneath the city at this date. Suetonius then returned to the legions&#x27; slower infantry, who met and defeated the Iceni army, slaughtering as many as 70,000 men and camp followers. There is a long-standing folklore belief that this battle took place at King&#x27;s Cross, simply because as a mediaeval village it was known as Battle Bridge. Suetonius&#x27;s flight back to his men, the razing of Verulamium (St Albans), and the battle shortly thereafter at &quot;a place with narrow jaws, backed by a forest&quot;, speaks against the tradition, and no supporting archaeological evidence has been yet discovered.

=== 1st century ===
After the sack of the city by Boudica and her defeat, a large military fort covering 15,000 m2 was built at Plantation Place on Cornhill, with 3m-high banks and enclosed by 3m deep double ditches. It was built as an emergency solution to protect Londinium&#x27;s important trade and to help reconstruct the city. It dominated the town and lay over the main road into Londinium controlling traffic from London Bridge and on the river. Several major building projects at this time such as roads, a new quay and a water lifting machine indicate the army had a key role in reconstruction. The fort was in use for less than 10 years.

The city was eventually rebuilt as a planned Roman town, its streets generally adhering to a grid skewed by major roads passing from the bridgehead and by changes in alignment produced by crossings over the local streams. It recovered after about a decade.

The first forum was constructed in the 70s or 80s and has been excavated, showing it had an open courtyard with a basilica and several shops around it, altogether measuring about . The basilica would have functioned as the city&#x27;s administrative heart, hearing law cases and seating the town&#x27;s local senate. It formed the north side of the forum, whose south entrance was located along the north side of the intersection of the present Gracechurch, Lombard, and Fenchurch Streets. Forums elsewhere typically had a civic temple constructed within the enclosed market area; British sites usually did not, instead placing a smaller shrine for Roman services somewhere within the basilica. The first forum in Londinium seems to have had a full temple, but placed outside just west of the forum.

By the turn of the century, Londinium was perhaps as large as 60,000 people and had replaced Camulodunum (Colchester) as the provincial capital. A large building discovered near Cannon Street Station has had its foundation dated to this era and is assumed to have been the governor&#x27;s palace. It boasted a garden, pools, and several large halls, some of which were decorated with mosaic floors. It stood on the east bank of the now-covered River Walbrook, near where it joins the Thames. The London Stone may originally have been part of the palace&#x27;s main entrance. Another site dating to this era is the bathhouse () at Huggin Hill, which remained in use prior to its demolition around the year 200. Brothels were legal but taxed.

In 2025 ruins of oldest Roman basilica in London were found. It was constructed between 78 and 84 A.D.)

=== Port ===
A large port complex on both banks near London Bridge was discovered during the 1980s. The bulk of the Roman port was quickly rebuilt after Boudicca&#x27;s rebellion when the waterfront was extended with gravel to permit a sturdy wharf to be built perpendicular to the shore. The port was built in four sections, starting upstream of the London Bridge and working down towards the Walbrook at the centre of Londinium. Expansion of the flourishing port continued into the 3rd century. Scraps of armour, leather straps, and military stamps on building timbers suggest that the site was constructed by the city&#x27;s legionaries. Major imports included fine pottery, jewellery and wine. Only two large warehouses are known, implying that Londinium functioned as a bustling trade centre rather than a supply depot and distribution centre like Ostia near Rome.

=== 2nd century ===
Emperor Hadrian visited Londinium in 122. The impressive public buildings from around this period may have been initially constructed in preparation for his visit or during the rebuilding that followed the &quot;Hadrianic Fire&quot;. The so-called fire is not mentioned in any historical sources but has been inferred by evidence of large-scale burning identified by archaeologists on several excavation sites around the City of London. The best dating evidence for this event(s) comes from burnt stocks of unsold Terra Sigilatta pottery, which can be dated to c. 120–125. These were found in destroyed warehouse or shop buildings at Regis House and Bucklersbury. Hadrianic fire horizons tend to be dated to around the 120s to 130s, but it is difficult to prove that they are contemporary, and there remains some uncertainty as to whether they indicate a single large fire or a series of smaller conflagrations. Fire destroyed substantial areas of the city in the area north of the Thames but does not seem to have damaged many major public buildings. There is very little evidence to suggest similar burning in the adjacent Southwark settlement. The Hadrianic fire (or fires) has normally been assumed to be accidental, but it has also been suggested that it could relate to an episode of political turbulence.

During the early 2nd century, Londinium was at its height, having recovered from the fire and again had between 45,000 and 60,000 inhabitants around 140, with many more stone houses and public buildings erected. Some areas were tightly packed with townhouses (). The town had piped water and a &quot;fairly-sophisticated&quot; drainage system. The governor&#x27;s palace was rebuilt, and an expanded forum was built around the earlier one over a period of 30 years from around 90 to 120 into a square measuring . Its three-storey basilica was probably visible across the city and was the largest in the empire north of the Alps; the marketplace rivalled those in Rome and was the largest in the north before Augusta Treverorum (Trier, Germany) became an imperial capital. The city&#x27;s temple of Jupiter was renovated, public and private bathhouses were erected, and a fort () was erected around 120 that maintained the city garrison northwest of town. The fort was square (with rounded corners) measuring more than and covering more than . Each side had a central gatehouse, and stone towers were erected at the corners and at points along each wall. 

Londinium&#x27;s amphitheatre, constructed in 70, is situated at Guildhall. When the Romans left in the 4th century, the amphitheatre lay derelict for hundreds of years. In the 11th century, the area was reoccupied, and by the 12th century the first Guildhall was built next to it.

A temple complex with two Romano-British temples was excavated at Empire Square, Long Lane, Southwark in 2002/2003. A large house there may have been a guesthouse. A marble slab with a dedication to the god Mars was discovered in the temple complex. The inscription mentions &quot;Londiniensi&quot; (&#x27;the Londoners&#x27;), the earliest known reference naming the people of London.
By the second half of the 2nd century, Londinium had many large, well-equipped stone buildings, some of which were richly adorned with wall paintings and floor mosaics, and had subfloor hypocausts. The Roman house at Billingsgate was built next to the waterfront and had its own bath. 

Londinium seems to have shrunk in both size and population in the second half of the 2nd century. The cause is uncertain, but plague is considered likely, as the Antonine Plague is recorded decimating other areas of Western Europe between 165 and 190. The end of imperial expansion in Britain after Hadrian&#x27;s decision to build his wall may have also damaged the city&#x27;s economy. Although Londinium remained important for the rest of the Roman period, no further expansion occurred. Londinium remained well populated, as archaeologists have found that much of the city after this date was covered in dark earth which accumulated relatively undisturbed over centuries.

=== London Wall ===
Some time between 190 and 225, the Romans built the London Wall, a defensive ragstone wall around the landward side of the city. Along with Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and the road network, the London Wall was one of the largest construction projects carried out in Roman Britain. The wall was originally about long, high, and thick. Its dry moat () was about deep and wide. In the 19th century, Charles Roach Smith estimated its length from the Tower west to Ludgate at about one mile () and its breadth from the northern wall to the bank of the Thames at around half that.

In addition to small pedestrian postern gates like the one by Tower Hill, it had four main gates: Bishopsgate and Aldgate in the northeast at the roads to Eboracum (York) and to Camulodunum (Colchester) and Newgate and Ludgate in the west along at the road that divided for travel to Viroconium (Wroxeter) and to Calleva (Silchester) and at another road that ran along the Thames to the city&#x27;s main cemetery and the old ford at Westminster. The wall partially utilised the army&#x27;s existing fort, strengthening its outer wall with a second course of stone to match the rest of the course. The fort had two gates of its own – Cripplegate to the north and another to the west – but these were not along major roads. Aldersgate was eventually added, perhaps to replace the west gate of the fort. (The names of all these gates are medieval, as they continued to be occasionally refurbished and replaced until their demolition in the 17th and 18th centuries to permit widening the roads.) The wall initially left the riverbank undefended: this was corrected in the 3rd century.

Although the reason for the wall&#x27;s construction is unknown, some historians have connected it with the Pictish invasion of the 180s. Others link it with Clodius Albinus, the British governor who attempted to usurp Septimius Severus in the 190s. The wall survived another 1,600 years and still roughly defines the City of London&#x27;s perimeter.

In 2023 a section of the wall at the City Wall at Vine Street Museum opened to the public.

=== 3rd century ===

Septimius Severus defeated Albinus in 197 and shortly afterwards divided the province of Britain into Upper and Lower halves, with the former controlled by a new governor in Eboracum (York). Despite the smaller administrative area, the economic stimulus provided by the wall and by Septimius Severus&#x27;s campaigns in Caledonia somewhat revived London&#x27;s fortunes in the early 3rd century. The northwest fort was abandoned and dismantled but archaeological evidence points to renewed construction activity from this period. The London Mithraeum rediscovered in 1954 dates from around 240, when it was erected on the east bank at the head of navigation on the River Walbrook about from the Thames.

====Riverside wall====
From about 255 onwards, raiding by Saxon pirates led to the construction of a riverside wall. It ran roughly along the course of present-day Thames street, which roughly formed the shoreline. Large collapsed sections of this wall were excavated at Blackfriars and the Tower in the 1970s.

====Temple of Isis====

An inscription found on a third-century stone altar recorded the rebuilding of a temple of Isis by the governor of Britannia Superior – Marcus Martiannius Pulcher. An earlier inscription found on a first-century flagon suggests that a temple of Isis had existed much earlier. The Egyptian goddess was believed to have influence over the sea and hence the safety of seafarers.

=== Carausian Revolt ===


In 286, the emperor Maximian issued a death sentence against Carausius, admiral of the Roman navy&#x27;s Britannic fleet (&quot;Classis Britannica&quot;), on charges of having abetted Frankish and Saxon piracy and of having embezzled recovered treasure. Carausius responded by consolidating his allies and territory and revolting. After fending off Maximian&#x27;s first assault in 288, he declared a new Britannic Empire and issued coins to that effect. Constantius Chlorus&#x27;s sack of his Gallic base at Gesoriacum (Boulogne), however, led his treasurer Allectus to assassinate and replace him. 

In 296, Chlorus mounted an invasion of Britain that prompted Allectus&#x27;s Frankish mercenaries to sack Londinium. They were only stopped by the arrival of a flotilla of Roman warships on the Thames, which slaughtered the survivors. The event was commemorated by the golden Arras Medallion, Chlorus on one side and on the other a woman kneeling at the city wall welcoming a mounted Roman soldier. Another memorial to the return of Londinium to Roman control was the construction of a new set of forum baths around 300. The structures were modest enough that they were previously identified as parts of the forum and market but are now recognised as elaborate and luxurious baths including a with two southern pools and an eastern swimming pool.

=== 4th century ===

Following the revolt, the Diocletian Reforms saw the British administration restructured. Londinium is universally supposed to have been the capital of one of them, but it remains unclear where the new provinces were, whether there were initially three or four in total, and whether Valentia represented a fifth province or a renaming of an older one. In the 12th century, Gerald of Wales listed &quot;Londonia&quot; as the capital of Flavia, having had Britannia Prima (Wales) and Secunda (Kent) severed from the territory of Upper Britain. Modern scholars more often list Londinium as the capital of Maxima Caesariensis on the assumption that the presence of the diocesan vicar in London would have required its provincial governor to outrank the others.

The governor&#x27;s palace and old large forum seem to have fallen out of use around 300, but in general the first half of the 4th century appears to have been a prosperous time for Britain, for the villa estates surrounding London appear to have flourished during this period. The London Mithraeum was rededicated, probably to Bacchus. A list of the 16 &quot;archbishops&quot; of London was recorded by Jocelyne of Furness in the 12th century, claiming the city&#x27;s Christian community was founded in the 2nd century under the legendary King Lucius and his missionary saints Fagan, Deruvian, Elvanus, and Medwin. None of that is considered credible by modern historians but, although the surviving text is problematic, either Bishop Restitutus or Adelphius at the 314 Council of Arles seems to have come from Londinium. 

The location of Londinium&#x27;s original cathedral is uncertain. The present structure of St Peter upon Cornhill was designed by Christopher Wren following the Great Fire in 1666, but it stands upon the highest point in the area of old Londinium and medieval legends tied it to the city&#x27;s earliest Christian community. However, the east end of St Peter&#x27;s and its high altar, is also positioned above the area where some basilicas of the period had a pagan shrine room (also known as an aedes). Wheeler proposed that a Christian church might have been established on its site and that this accounted for the later medieval legends. The possible existence of the shrine room is supported by 19th-century excavations under Gracechurch Street, immediately adjacent to the church&#x27;s eastern end. These unearthed an adjoining room covered in yellow panels with a black border, &#x27;with a tessellated floor, suggesting it may have had a higher status than normal, possibly acting as an antechamber for the aedes or shrine-room&#x27;. The alignment of the church is close to the lines of the basilica, being off by just two degrees, and it is feasible for the understructure to have utilized the dry solid 2nd century basilica wall fabric for support.

If St Peter&#x27;s was built in the Roman era, it would make the church contemporaneous to the potential Romano-British church at Silchester, similarly built adjacent to the Roman Basilica and most likely pre-Constantine in age. London certainly had a Christian community in 314 when Bishop Restitutus attended the Council of Arles. This community must have had some meeting place, and apart from St Peter&#x27;s no other location has yet been proposed, either in antiquity or in the modern era. There is, however, some conflicting evidence to the theory that St Peter&#x27;s was deliberately cited above a pagan shrine room. Current research suggests it was very rare for early English Christian churches to be founded in pagan temples and that when temples were turned into churches, this occurred later, in the late 6th century and onwards. This was also true elsewhere in the Roman Empire; for example in Rome. By this time the former associations of the sites had probably died down. There is more evidence that early English Christian churches met in private homes and that some Roman villas also converted rooms to dedicated places of Christian worship.

In 1995 a large and ornate 4th-century building on Tower Hill was discovered: built sometime between 350 and 400, it seems to have mimicked St Ambrose&#x27;s cathedral in the imperial capital at Milan on a still-larger scale. It was about long by about wide. Excavations by David Sankey of MOLAS established it was constructed out of stone taken from other buildings, including a veneer of black marble. It was probably dedicated to St Paul.

From 340 onwards, northern Britain was repeatedly attacked by Picts and Gaels. In 360, a large-scale attack forced Emperor Julian to send troops to deal with the problem. Large efforts were made to improve Londinium&#x27;s defences around the same time. At least 22 semi-circular towers were added to the city walls to provide platforms for ballistae and the present state of the river wall suggests hurried repair work around this time. In 367, the Great Conspiracy saw a coordinated invasion of Picts, Gaels, and Saxons joined with a mutiny of troops along the wall. Count Theodosius dealt with the problem over the next few years, using Londinium—then known as &quot;Augusta&quot;—as his base. It may have been at this point that one of the existing provinces was renamed Valentia, although the account of Theodosius&#x27;s actions describes it as a province recovered from the enemy.

In 382, Emperor Magnus Maximus organised all of the British-based troops and attempted to establish himself as western emperor. The event was obviously important to the Britons, as &quot;Macsen Wledig&quot; would remain a major figure in Welsh folklore, and several medieval Welsh dynasties claimed descent from him. He was probably responsible for London&#x27;s new church in the 370s or 380s. He was initially successful but was defeated by Theodosius I at the 388 Battle of Save. An additional stretch of the river wall near Tower Hill seems to have been built further from the shore at some point over the next decade.

=== 5th century ===
With few troops left in Britain, many Romano-British towns—including Londinium—declined drastically over the next few decades. Many of London&#x27;s public buildings had fallen into disrepair by this point, and excavations of the port show signs of rapid disuse. Between 407 and 409, large numbers of barbarians overran Gaul and Hispania, seriously weakening communication between Rome and Britain. Trade broke down, officials went unpaid, and Romano-British troops elected their own leaders. Constantine III declared himself emperor over the West and crossed the Channel, an act considered the Roman withdrawal from Britain since Emperor Honorius subsequently directed the Britons to look to their own defence rather than send another garrison force. Surviving accounts are scanty and mixed with Welsh and Saxon legends concerning Vortigern, Hengest, Horsa, and Ambrosius Aurelianus. Even archaeological evidence of Londinium during this period is minimal.

Despite remaining on the list of Roman provinces, Romano-Britain seems to have dropped their remaining loyalties to Rome. Raiding by the Irish, Picts, and Saxons continued, but 6th-century monk Gildas records a time of luxury and plenty which is sometimes attributed to reduced taxation. Archaeologists have found evidence that a small number of wealthy families continued to maintain a Roman lifestyle until the middle of the 5th century, inhabiting villas in the southeastern corner of the city and importing luxuries. Medieval accounts state that the invasions that established Anglo-Saxon England (the &quot;Adventus Saxonum&quot;) did not begin in earnest until some time in the 440s and 450s. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that the Britons fled to Londinium in terror after their defeat at the Battle of Crecganford (probably Crayford), but nothing further is said. By the end of the 5th century, the city was largely an uninhabited ruin, its large church on Tower Hill burnt to the ground.

Over the next century, Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians arrived and established tribal areas and kingdoms. The area of the Roman city was administered as part of the Kingdom of the East Saxons – Essex, although the Saxon settlement of Lundenwic was not within the Roman walls but to the west in Aldwych. It was not until the Viking invasions of England that King Alfred the Great moved the settlement back within the safety of the Roman walls, which gave it the name Lundenburh. The foundations of the river wall, however, were undermined over time and had completely collapsed by the 11th century. Memory of the earlier settlement survived: it is generally identified as the counted among the 28 cities of Britain included in the &quot;History of the Britons&quot; traditionally attributed to Nennius.

== Demographics ==

The population of Londinium is estimated to have peaked around 100 AD when the population is estimated between about 30,000 and 60,000. After about 150 the population may have fallen by as much as two thirds possibly as the regional economic centres developed, and Londinium as the main port for imported goods became less significant. The Antonine Plague which swept the empire from 165 to 180 may have had an effect. Pottery workshops outside the city in Brockley Hill and Highgate appear to have ended production around 160.

Londinium was an ethnically diverse city with inhabitants from across the Roman Empire, including those with backgrounds in continental Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. A 2017 genetic test of human remains in Roman cemeteries states the &quot;presence of people born in London with North African ancestry is not an unusual or atypical result for Londinium.&quot; A 2016 study of the isotope analysis of 20 bodies from various periods suggests that at least 12 had grown up locally, with four being immigrants. The average height for male Londoners was 5&#x27;6¾&quot; (169cm) and the average height for female Londoners was 5&#x27;2¼&quot; (158cm).

== Excavation ==
Many ruins remain buried beneath London, although understanding them can be difficult. Owing to London&#x27;s geology, which consists of a Taplow Terrace deep bed of brickearth, sand, and gravel over clay, Roman gravel roads can only be identified as such if they were repeatedly relayered or if the spans of gravel can be traced across several sites. The minimal remains from wooden structures are easy to miss, and stone buildings may leave foundations, but as with the great forum they were often dismantled for stone during the Middle Ages and early modern period.

The first extensive archaeological review of the Roman city of London was done in the 17th century after the Great Fire of 1666. Christopher Wren&#x27;s renovation of St Paul&#x27;s on Ludgate Hill found no evidence supporting Camden&#x27;s contention that it had been built over a Roman temple to the goddess Diana. The extensive rebuilding of London in the 19th century and following the German bombing campaign during World War II also allowed for large parts of old London to be recorded and preserved while modern updates were made. The construction of the London Coal Exchange led to the discovery of the Roman house at Billingsgate in 1848. 

In the 1860s, excavations by Augustus Pitt Rivers uncovered a large number of human skulls and almost no other bones in the bed of the Walbrook. The discovery recalls a passage in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s pseudohistorical &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; where Asclepiodotus besieged the last remnants of the usurper Allectus&#x27;s army at &quot;Londonia&quot;. Having battered the town&#x27;s walls with siegeworks constructed by allied Britons, Asclepiodotus accepted the commander&#x27;s surrender only to have the Venedotians rush upon them, ritually decapitating them and throwing the heads into the river &quot;Gallemborne&quot;. Asclepiodotus&#x27;s siege was an actual event that occurred in 296, but further skull finds beneath the 3rd-century wall place at least some of the slaughter before its construction, leading most modern scholars to attribute them to Boudica&#x27;s forces. 

In 1947, the city&#x27;s northwest fortress of the city garrison was discovered. In 1954, excavations of what was thought to have been an early church instead revealed the London Mithraeum, which was relocated to permit building over its original site. The building erected at the time has since been demolished, and the temple has been returned to its former location under the Bloomberg building.

Archaeologists began the first intensive excavation of the waterfront sites of Roman London in the 1970s. What was not found during this time has been built over, making it very difficult to study or discover anything new. Another phase of archaeological work followed the deregulation of the London Stock Exchange in 1986, which led to extensive new construction in the city&#x27;s financial district. From 1991, many excavations were undertaken by the Museum of London&#x27;s Archaeology Service, although it was spun off into the separately-run MOLA in 2011 following legislation to address the Rose Theatre fiasco.

== Displays ==

Major finds from Roman London, including mosaics, wall fragments, and old buildings, were formerly housed in the London and Guildhall Museums. These merged after 1965 into the present Museum of London, sited from 1976 until 2022 near the Barbican Centre. The Museum of London Docklands, a separate branch dealing with the history of London&#x27;s ports, opened on the Isle of Dogs in 2003. Other finds from Roman London continue to be held in the British Museum.

Much of the surviving wall is medieval, but Roman-era stretches are visible near Tower Hill tube station, in a hotel courtyard at nearby 8–10 Coopers Row, and in St Alphege Gardens off Wood Street. A section of the river wall is visible inside the Tower of London. Parts of the amphitheatre are on display beneath the Guildhall Art Gallery. The southwestern tower of the Roman fort northwest of town can still be seen at Noble Street. Occasionally, Roman sites are incorporated into the foundations of new buildings for future study, but these are not generally available to the public.

<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig Leichhardt (; 23 October 1813 – ), known as Ludwig Leichhardt, was a German explorer and naturalist, most famous for his exploration of northern and central Australia.

==Early life==
Leichhardt was born on 23 October 1813 in the hamlet of Sabrodt near the village of Trebatsch, today part of Tauche, in the Prussian Province of Brandenburg (now within the Federal Republic of Germany). He was the fourth son and sixth of the eight children of Christian Hieronymus Matthias Leichhardt, farmer and royal inspector and his wife Charlotte Sophie, &quot;née&quot; Strählow. Between 1831 and 1836 Leichhardt studied philosophy, language, and natural sciences at the Universities of Göttingen and Berlin but never received a university degree. He moved to England in 1837, continued his study of the natural sciences at various places, including the British Museum, London, and the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, and undertook field work in several European countries, including France, Italy and Switzerland.

==Exploration==
On 14 February 1842 Leichhardt arrived in Sydney, Australia. His aim was to explore inland Australia and he was hopeful of a government appointment in his fields of interest. In September 1842 Leichhardt went to the Hunter River valley north of Sydney to study the geology, flora and fauna of the region, and to observe farming methods. He then set out on his own on a specimen-collecting journey that took him from Newcastle, New South Wales, to Moreton Bay in Queensland. On 23 September 1842, at the invitation of Alexander Walker Scott, Leichhardt arrived at Ash Island, where he spent two or three days. Leichhardt&#x27;s diary from 28 December 1842-July 1843, mostly in German, is available on-line at the State Library of New South Wales.


=== The First Leichhardt Expedition (1844–1846) ===
After returning to Sydney early in 1844, Leichhardt hoped to take part in a proposed government-sponsored expedition from Moreton Bay to Port Essington north of Darwin. When plans for this expedition fell through, Leichhardt decided to mount the expedition himself. Accompanied by volunteers and supported by private funding, he left Sydney in August 1844 to sail to Moreton Bay, where four more joined the party. The expedition departed on 1 October 1844 from Jimbour Homestead, the farthest outpost of settlement on the Queensland Darling Downs. During this trip, Leichhardt named Seven Emu Creek, after shooting a mob of emus nearby, a name later taken on by a large cattle station still in existence, Seven Emu Station.

After a nearly 4,800-kilometre (3,000-mile) overland journey, and having long been given up for dead, Leichhardt on 17 December 1845 arrived in Port Essington, where a company of Imperial marines was stationed. He returned to Sydney by ship, arriving on 25 March 1846 to a hero&#x27;s welcome. The &quot;Journal of an Overland Expedition in Australia, from Moreton Bay to Port Essington, a Distance of Upwards of 3000 miles, During the Years 1844 and 1845&quot; by Leichhardt describes this expedition. Leichhardt&#x27;s diary from 9 September 1845-23 March 1846, is available on-line at the State Library of New South Wales.

A memorial to John Gilbert, one of Leichhardt&#x27;s companions on this journey, can be found on the north wall of St James&#x27; Church, Sydney. Under the title &quot;Dulce et Decorum Est Pro Scientia Mori&quot; (a variation on the more commonly seen &quot;Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori)&quot; the inscription on the monument, which was &quot;erected by the colonists of New South Wales&quot; reads: &quot;in memory of John Gilbert, Ornithologist, who was speared by the blacks on 29 June 1845 during the first overland expedition to Port Essington by Dr Ludwig Leichhardt and his intrepid companions&quot;. There is also a memorial to Gilbert at Gilbert&#x27;s Lookout at Taroom.

=== The Second Leichhardt Expedition (1846) ===
Leichhardt&#x27;s second expedition, undertaken with a government grant and substantial private subscriptions, started in December 1846. It was supposed to take him from the Darling Downs to the west coast of Australia and ultimately to the Swan River and Perth. However, after covering only the expedition team was forced to return in June 1847 due to heavy rain, malarial fever and famine. Members of the party nearly mutinied after learning that Leichhardt had failed to bring along a medical kit. Faced with failure, Leichhardt seems to have suffered a nervous breakdown, and Aboriginal guide Harry Brown effectively took over as leader of the party, taking them successfully back to the Darling Downs.

Leichhardt blamed failure of the expedition on his men&#x27;s weakness. John Frederick Mann, his second-in-charge, published a rebuttal 20 years later, and a book, &quot;Eight Months with Leichhardt&quot;, after 40 years.

=== Subsequent activities ===
After recovering from malaria Leichhardt spent six weeks in 1847 examining the course of the Condamine River, southern Queensland, and the country between the route of another expedition led by Sir Thomas Mitchell in 1846 and his own route, covering nearly . Leichhardt&#x27;s diary from 17 August 1847 to 14 September 1847, is available on-line at the State Library of New South Wales.

In April 1847 Leichhardt shared the annual prize of the Paris Geographical Society, for the most important geographic discovery with the French explorer Charles-Xavier Rochet d&#x27;Héricourt. Soon afterward, on 24 May, the Royal Geographical Society, London, awarded Leichhardt its Patron&#x27;s Medal as recognition of &#x27;the increased knowledge of the great continent of Australia&#x27; gained by his Moreton Bay-Port Essington journey. Leichhardt himself never saw these medals but was aware he had been awarded them. In one of his last known letters he wrote:

In 2012 the National Museum of Australia purchased the medal awarded to Leichhardt by London&#x27;s Royal Geographical Society in 1847. It came directly from descendants of the Leichhardt family in Mexico.

==Disappearance==

In 1848 Leichhardt again set out from the Condamine River to reach the Swan River. The expedition consisted of Leichhardt, four Europeans, two Aboriginal guides, seven horses, 20 mules and 50 bullocks. The Europeans were Adolph Classen, Arthur Hentig, Donald Stuart and Thomas Hands, a ticket of leave holder who replaced Kelly at Henry Stuart Russell&#x27;s Cecil Plains station. The Aboriginal guides were Wommai and Billy Bombat, from Port Stephens.

The party was last seen on 3 April 1848 at Allan Macpherson&#x27;s Cogoon run, an outlying part of Mount Abundance Station, west of Roma on the Darling Downs. Leichhardt&#x27;s disappearance after moving inland, although investigated by many, remains a mystery. The expedition had been expected to take two to three years, but after no sign or word was received from Leichhardt it was assumed that he and the others in the party had died. The latest evidence suggests that they may have perished somewhere in the Great Sandy Desert of the Australian interior.

Four years after Leichhardt&#x27;s disappearance, the Government of New South Wales sent out a search expedition under Hovenden Hely. The expedition found nothing but a single campsite with a tree marked &quot;L&quot; over &quot;XVA&quot;. In 1858 another search expedition was sent out, this time under Augustus Gregory. On 21 April near what is now Blackall, beside the Barcoo River, this expedition found a tree marked &quot;L&quot;.

In 1864 Duncan McIntyre discovered two trees marked with &quot;L&quot; on the Flinders River near the Gulf of Carpentaria. After his return to Victoria McIntyre telegraphed the Royal Society on 15 December 1864 that he had found &quot;two trees marked L about 15 years old&quot;. He was subsequently appointed leader of a search expedition, but found no further trace of Leichhardt.

In 1869 the Government of Western Australia heard rumours of a place where the remains of horses and men killed by indigenous Australians could be seen. A search expedition was sent out under John Forrest, but nothing was found, and it was decided that the story might refer to the bones of horses left for dead at Poison Rock during Robert Austin&#x27;s expedition of 1854.

The mystery of Leichhardt&#x27;s fate remained in the minds of explorers for many years. During David Carnegie&#x27;s expedition through the Gibson and Great Sandy Deserts in 1896 he encountered some Aborigines who had among their possessions an iron tent peg, the lid of a tin matchbox and part of the ironwork of a saddle. Carnegie speculated that these were from Leichhardt&#x27;s expedition. Except for a small brass plate that was found in 1900 bearing Leichhardt&#x27;s name, &quot;no artefacts with corroborated provenance have been able to shed light on Leichhardt&#x27;s final expedition&quot;.

In 1975, a ranger named Zac Mathias exhibited photographs in Darwin of Aboriginal cave paintings that showed white men with an animal.

===Leichhardt nameplate===

In 2006 Australian historians and scientists authenticated a tiny brass plate () marked &quot;LUDWIG LEICHHARDT 1848&quot;, discovered around 1900 by an Aboriginal stockman near Sturt Creek, between the Tanami and Great Sandy deserts, just inside Western Australia from the border with the Northern Territory. When found, the plate was attached to a partially burnt shotgun slung in a boab tree which was engraved with the initial &quot;L&quot;. The plate is now part of the National Museum of Australia collection.

Before the nameplate was authenticated, historians could only speculate on the route Leichhardt had taken and how far he had journeyed before perishing. The location of the plate indicated that he made it at least two thirds of the way across the continent during his east-west crossing attempt. It also suggested that he was following a northern arc from Moreton Bay in Queensland to the Swan River in Western Australia, following the headwaters of rivers, rather than heading straight through the desert interior.

For a speculative &quot;ballistic&quot; biography of the nameplate and its significance in Indigenous and non-Indigenous lifeworlds, see Andrew Hurley&#x27;s article, &quot;Reports, silences and repercussion: wondering about the ballistic biography of the Leichhardt gunplate.&quot;

===Aboriginal oral history===
In 2003, a librarian found a letter in the NSW State Library that may shed light on Leichhardt&#x27;s disappearance. Dated 2 April 1874, the letter, received by Sydney clergyman William Branwhite Clarke, was written by Gordon, a station owner from the Darling Downs who had met Leichhardt in the days before his party vanished. The letter relates how Gordon moved to Wallumbilla and how, after living there for more than 10 years, he had befriended the Wallumbilla tribe who in time came to openly share their stories and folklore with him. One detailed story referred to the death of a white man who was leading a party of mules and bullocks along the Maranoa River many years earlier. According to the Wallumbilla, a large group of Aboriginals had encircled the party and murdered everyone in it. It has been speculated that if the story was true, the expedition&#x27;s belongings were likely traded widely after the massacre, explaining how items that could have come only from Leichhardt&#x27;s expedition were found in the Gibson Desert and why the rifle butt with the brass plate was found some west of the Maranoa River.

===Theories===
The validity of all the claimed &#x27;Leichhardt&#x27; relics and the various theories proposed is discussed in a 2013 book entitled &quot;Where is Dr Leichhardt?: the greatest mystery in Australian history&quot;.

==Legacy==

Leichhardt&#x27;s contribution to science, especially his successful expedition to Port Essington in 1845, was officially recognised. In 1847 the Geographical Society, Paris, awarded its annual prize for geographic discovery equally to Leichhardt and a French explorer, Rochet d&#x27;Héricourt; also in 1847, the Royal Geographical Society in London awarded Leichhardt its Patron&#x27;s Medal; and Prussia recognised his achievement by granting him a king&#x27;s pardon for having failed to return to Prussia when due to serve a period of compulsory military training. The Port Essington expedition was one of the longest land exploration journeys in Australia, and a useful one in the discovery of excellent pastoral country.

Leichhardt&#x27;s accounts and collections were valued, and his observations are generally considered to be accurate. He is remembered as one of the most authoritative early recorders of Australia&#x27;s environment and the best trained natural scientist to explore Australia to that time. Leichhardt left a record of his observations in Australia from 1842 to 1848 in diaries, letters, notebooks, sketch-books, maps, and in his published works.

A detailed map of Ludwig Leichhardt&#x27;s route in Australia from Moreton Bay to Port Essington (1844 &amp; 1845), from his Original Map, adjusted and drawn... by John Arrowsmith was ranked #8 in the &#x27;Top 150: Documenting Queensland&#x27; exhibition when it toured to venues around Queensland from February 2009 to April 2010. The exhibition was part of Queensland State Archives&#x27; events and exhibition program which contributed to the state&#x27;s Q150 celebrations, marking the 150th anniversary of the separation of Queensland from New South Wales.

Harsh criticism of Leichhardt&#x27;s character was published some time after his disappearance and his reputation suffered badly. The fairness of this criticism continues to be debated. Leichhardt&#x27;s failed attempt to make the first east–west crossing of the Australian continent may be compared with the Burke and Wills expedition of 1860–61, which succeeded in crossing from south to north, but failed to return. However, Leichhardt&#x27;s success in making it to Port Essington in 1845 was a major achievement, which ranks him with other successful European explorers of Australia.

Australia has commemorated Ludwig Leichhardt through the use of his name in several places: Leichhardt, a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney, and the surrounding Municipality of Leichhardt; Leichhardt, a suburb of Ipswich; the Leichhardt Highway and the Leichhardt River in Queensland; and the Division of Leichhardt in the Australian Parliament. The name of the eucalyptus tree species &quot;Corymbia leichhardtii&quot; commemorates Leichhardt.

The insect &quot;Petasida ephippigera&quot; is commonly known as Leichhardt&#x27;s grasshopper, and an alternative name for the largetooth sawfish (&quot;Pristis pristis&quot;) is Leichhardt&#x27;s sawfish.

On 23 October 1988, a monument was erected beside Leichhardt&#x27;s blazed tree at Taroom by the local historical society and tourism association to celebrate Leichhardt&#x27;s 175th birthday and the Bicentenary of Australia.[2] The tree was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 1992.

Andrew Hurley&#x27;s 2018 ‚afterlife biography‘, &quot;Ludwig Leichhardt‘s Ghosts: The Strange Career of a Travelling Myth&quot;, documents many of the different ways Leichhardt has been remembered in Australia (by both non-Indigenous and Indigenous people) as well as in his native Germany.

Scientific specimens collected by Leichhardt are cared for at institutions including the National Herbarium of Victoria (MEL), Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria, and the National Herbarium of New South Wales (NSW), Sydney Botanic Gardens.

== In popular culture ==
Leichhardt&#x27;s life inspired a range of &quot;Lemurian&quot; novels, starting with George Firth Scott&#x27;s book &quot;The Last Lemurian&quot; (1898). His last expedition was the inspiration for the 1957 novel &quot;Voss&quot; by Patrick White.

He inspired the radio plays &quot;The Lost Leader&quot; (1934) and &quot;What Happened to Leichhardt?&quot; (1948).

In February 2013 the band Manilla Road released a song called &quot;Mysterium&quot;, based on Leichhardt&#x27;s explorations and disappearance.

<doc id="207214" wikidata="Q1575297" url="?curid=207214" title="USS Washington (BB-56)">
<text>USS &quot;Washington&quot; (BB-56) was the second and final member of the of fast battleships, the first vessel of the type built for the United States Navy. Built under the Washington Treaty system, &quot;North Carolina&quot;″s design was limited in displacement and armament, though the United States used a clause in the Second London Naval Treaty to increase the main battery from the original armament of nine guns to nine guns. The ship was laid down in 1938 and completed in May 1941, while the United States was still neutral during World War II. Her initial career was spent training along the East Coast of the United States until Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, bringing the United States into the war.

&quot;Washington&quot; was initially deployed to Britain to reinforce the Home Fleet, which was tasked with protecting convoys carrying supplies to the Soviet Union. She saw no action during this period, as the German fleet remained in port, and &quot;Washington&quot; was recalled to the US in July 1942 to be refitted and transferred to the Pacific. Immediately sent to the south Pacific to reinforce Allied units fighting the Guadalcanal campaign, the ship became the flagship of Rear Admiral Willis Lee. She saw action at the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on the night of 14–15 November in company with the battleship and four destroyers. After &quot;South Dakota&quot; inadvertently drew heavy Japanese fire by sailing too closely to Admiral Nobutake Kondō&#x27;s squadron, &quot;Washington&quot; took advantage of the Japanese preoccupation with &quot;South Dakota&quot; to inflict fatal damage on the Japanese battleship and the destroyer , while avoiding damage herself. &quot;Washington&quot;″s attack disrupted Kondō&#x27;s planned bombardment of U.S. Marine positions on Guadalcanal and forced the remaining Japanese ships to withdraw.

From 1943 onward, she was primarily occupied with screening the fast carrier task force, though she also occasionally shelled Japanese positions in support of the various amphibious assaults. During this period, &quot;Washington&quot; participated in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign in late 1943 and early 1944, the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign in mid-1944, and the Philippines campaign in late 1944 and early 1945. Operations to capture Iwo Jima and Okinawa followed in 1945, and during the later stages of the Battle of Okinawa, &quot;Washington&quot; was detached to undergo an overhaul, though by the time it was completed, Japan had surrendered, ending the war. &quot;Washington&quot; then moved to the east coast of the US, where she was refitted to serve as a troop transport as part of Operation Magic Carpet, carrying a group of over 1,600 soldiers home from Britain. She was thereafter decommissioned in 1947 and assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, where she remained until 1960 when she was stricken from the naval register and sold for scrap the next year.

==Design==


The &quot;North Carolina&quot; class was the first new battleship design built under the Washington Naval Treaty system; her design was bound by the terms of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which added a restriction on her main battery of guns no larger than . The General Board evaluated a number of designs ranging from traditional battleships akin to the &quot;standard&quot; series or fast battleships, and ultimately a fast battleship armed with twelve 14-inch guns was selected. After the ships were authorized, however, the United States invoked the escalator clause in the treaty that allowed an increase to guns in the event that any member nation refused to sign the treaty, which Japan refused to do.

&quot;Washington&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full combat load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by eight oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . She carried three Vought OS2U Kingfisher floatplanes for aerial reconnaissance, which were launched by a pair of aircraft catapults on her fantail. Her peace-time crew numbered 1,800 officers and enlisted men, but the crew swelled to 99 officers and 2,035 enlisted during the war.
The ship was armed with a main battery of nine 16 in /45 caliber Mark 6 guns guns in three triple-gun turrets on the centerline, two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward, with the third aft. The secondary battery consisted of twenty /38 caliber dual purpose guns mounted in twin turrets clustered amidships, five turrets on either side. As designed, the ship was equipped with an anti-aircraft battery of sixteen guns and eighteen .50-caliber (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns, but her anti-aircraft battery was expanded greatly during her career.

The main armored belt was thick, while the main armored deck was up to thick. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces, and they were mounted atop barbettes that were protected with the same thickness of steel. The conning tower had thick sides. The ship&#x27;s armor layout had been designed with opponents equipped with 14-inch guns in mind, but since the treaty system broke down just before construction began, her design could not be revised to improve the scale of protection to defend against heavier guns. Despite this shortcoming, the &quot;North Carolina&quot; class proved to be more successful battleships than the better-armored but very cramped .

===Modifications===
&quot;Washington&quot; received a number of upgrades over the course of her career, primarily consisting of radar and a new light anti-aircraft battery. The ship received three Mark 3 fire-control radar sets for the main battery, four Mark 4 radars for the secondary guns, a CXAM air-search radar, and an SG surface-search radar. During her early 1944 refit, she received an SK air-search radar in place of the CXAM and a second SG radar; her Mark 3 radars were replaced with more advanced Mark 8 sets, though she retained one of the Mark 3s as a backup. Her Mark 4 radars were later replaced with a combination of Mark 12 and Mark 22 sets. In her final refit in August and September 1945, she had an SK radar forward, an SR air-search set aft, and an SG radar in both positions. A TDY jammer was installed on her forward fire control tower.

&quot;Washington&quot;″s 1.1 in battery was replaced with forty Bofors guns in ten quadruple mounts in April 1943, and in August, the number of guns had increased to sixty in fifteen quadruple mounts. Her original light battery of eighteen .50-cal machine guns was decreased to twelve and twenty Oerlikon autocannon in single mounts were installed in early 1942. In June, she had her .50-cal battery increased to twenty-eight barrels, but by September, all were replaced in favor of a uniform battery of forty 20 mm cannon. During the April 1943 refit, her anti-aircraft armament was increased to a total of sixty-four 20 mm cannon. A year later, in April 1944, she lost one of the single mounts in favor of an experimental quadruple 20 mm mount. In November 1944, the ship was slated to have the battery reduced to 48 barrels, but this never happened and instead, in early 1945, she had eight single mounts replaced with eight twin mounts, bringing her final 20 mm battery to seventy-five guns.

== Service history ==
The keel for &quot;Washington&quot; was laid down on 14 June 1938 at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Her completed hull was launched on 1 June 1940, and after completing fitting-out work, she was commissioned into the fleet on 15 May 1941. She began builder&#x27;s sea trials on 3 August, but like her sister ship , she suffered from excessive vibration while running at high speed from her original three-bladed screws. Tests with &quot;North Carolina&quot; produced a workable solution (though the problem was never fully corrected): two four-bladed screws on the outer shafts and two five-bladed propellers on the inboard shafts. Tests continued during her shakedown cruise and subsequent initial training, which were conducted along the East Coast of the United States, as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. She conducted high speed tests in December, during which she failed to reach her designed speed due to the vibration problems.

During this period, the United States was still neutral during World War II. &quot;Washington&quot; frequently trained with &quot;North Carolina&quot; and the aircraft carrier , with &quot;Washington&quot; serving as the flagship of Rear Admiral John W. Wilcox Jr., the commander of Battleship Division (BatDiv) 6, part of the Atlantic Fleet. Her initial working up training continued into 1942, by which time the country had entered the war as a result of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and Germany&#x27;s subsequent declaration of war. Modifications to the ship&#x27;s screws continued as late as February 1942, but these also proved unsuccessful.

===Atlantic operations===
With the country now at war, &quot;Washington&quot; was assigned as the flagship of Task Force (TF) 39, still under Wilcox&#x27;s command, which departed for Britain on 26 March. The unit, which included &quot;Wasp&quot; and the heavy cruisers and , were to reinforce the British Home Fleet based in Scapa Flow. The Home Fleet had been weakened by the need to detach units, particularly Force H, to take part in the invasion of Madagascar, and the American battle group was needed to help counter the German battleship and other heavy surface units based in occupied Norway. The next day, while crossing the Atlantic, Wilcox was swept overboard. &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; and a pair of destroyers searched for the admiral, and &quot;Wasp&quot; sent aircraft aloft to assist the effort, but lookouts on the destroyer spotted him, face down in the water, having already drowned. The search was called off and the task force continued on to its destination. Rear Admiral Robert C. Giffen, aboard &quot;Wichita&quot;, took command of the unit, which was met at sea by the British cruiser on 3 April. The ships arrived in Scapa Flow two days later, where it came under the command of Admiral John Tovey, the commander of the Home Fleet.

For the rest of the month, &quot;Washington&quot; and the other American ships were occupied with battle practice and familiarization training with the Home Fleet to prepare the different countries&#x27; ships for joint operations. TF 39 was redesignated TF 99 in late April, &quot;Washington&quot; still serving as the flagship. The ships embarked on their first operation on 28 April to conduct a sweep for German warships ahead of the supply convoy PQ 15 to the Soviet Union. The ships of TF 99 operated with elements of the Home Fleet, including the battleship and the carrier . During the operation, &quot;King George V&quot; accidentally rammed and sank the destroyer ; &quot;Washington&quot; was following too closely to avoid the wreckage, and as she passed over the sinking destroyer, &quot;Punjabi&quot;″s depth charges exploded. The shock from the blast damaged some of &quot;Washington&quot;″s radars and fire-control equipment and caused a small leak in one of her fuel tanks. &quot;King George V&quot; had to return to port for repairs, but &quot;Washington&quot; and the rest of TF 99 remained at sea until 5 May. The ships stopped at Hvalfjörður, Iceland, where they took on supplies from the supply ship .

The ships remained in Iceland until 15 May, when they got underway to return to Scapa Flow, arriving there on 3 June. The next day, Admiral Harold Rainsford Stark, the Commander of Naval Forces Europe, visited the ship and made her his temporary headquarters. On 7 June, King George VI came aboard to inspect &quot;Washington&quot;, and after Stark left she resumed escorting convoys in the Arctic; these included convoys QP 12, PQ 16, and PQ 17. The first two occurred at the same time, with QP 12 returning from the Soviet Union while PQ 16 carrying another load of supplies and weapons. &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;Victorious&quot;, and the battleship provided distant support but was not directly engaged by the German U-boats and aircraft that raided PQ 16; QP 12 largely evaded German attention and passed without significant incident.

The PQ 17 operation resulted in disaster when reconnaissance incorrectly reported &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, the heavy cruisers , , and &quot;Lützow&quot;, and nine destroyers to be approaching to attack the convoy, when in reality the Germans were still off the coast of Norway, their progress having been hampered by several of the vessels running aground. The reports of German heavy units at sea prompted the convoy commander to order his ships to scatter, which left them vulnerable to U-boats and &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; attacks that sank twenty-four of the thirty-five transport ships. While in Hvalfjörður on 14 July, Giffen moved his flag back to &quot;Wichita&quot; and &quot;Washington&quot;, escorted by four destroyers, got underway to return to the United States. She arrived in Gravesend Bay on 21 July and moved to the Brooklyn Navy Yard two days later for an overhaul.

=== Pacific operations ===
====Guadalcanal campaign====

After completing the refit, &quot;Washington&quot; got underway on 23 August, bound for the Pacific with an escort of three destroyers. She passed through the Panama Canal on 28 August and arrived in Nukuʻalofa in Tonga on 14 September. There, she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Willis Lee, then the commander of BatDiv 6 and Task Group (TG) 12.2. On 15 September, &quot;Washington&quot; sailed to meet the ships of TF 17, centered on the carrier ; the ships thereafter operated together and went to Nouméa in New Caledonia to begin operations in support of the campaign in the Solomon Islands. The ships, based out of Nouméa and Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides, covered convoys bringing supplies and reinforcements to the marines fighting on Guadalcanal into early November.

During one of these convoy operations in mid-October, &quot;Washington&quot;, a pair of cruisers, and five destroyers provided distant support but were too far away to take part in the Battle of Cape Esperance on the night of 11–12 October. Shortly thereafter, &quot;Washington&quot; was transferred to TF 64, the surface combatant force assigned to the Guadalcanal area, still under Lee&#x27;s command. At this time, the unit also included one heavy and two light cruisers and six destroyers. Over the course of 21–24 October, Japanese land-based reconnaissance aircraft made repeated contacts with TF 64 as a Japanese fleet approached the area, but in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands that began on the 25th, the Japanese concentrated their air attacks on the American carriers of TF 17 and 61. On 27 October, the Japanese submarine attempted to torpedo &quot;Washington&quot; but missed.

By early November, the US fleet had been reduced considerably in offensive power; the carriers &quot;Wasp&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot; had been sunk, leaving just the carrier , &quot;Washington&quot;, and the new battleship as the only capital ships available to Allied forces fighting in the campaign. &quot;Washington&quot; joined the other two ships in TF 16, which also included the heavy cruiser , and nine destroyers. The ships sortied on 11 November to return to the fighting off Guadalcanal. The cruiser and two more destroyers joined them the following day. On 13 November, after learning that a major Japanese attack was approaching, Halsey detached &quot;South Dakota&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot;, and four of the destroyers as Task Group 16.3, again under Lee&#x27;s command. &quot;Enterprise&quot;, her forward elevator damaged from the action at Santa Cruz, was kept to the south as a reserve and to prevent the sole operational American carrier in the Pacific from being lost. The ships of TG 16.3 were to block an anticipated Japanese bombardment group in the waters off Guadalcanal.

===== Naval Battle of Guadalcanal =====

As Lee&#x27;s task group approached Guadalcanal, his Japanese counterpart, Admiral Nobutake Kondō steamed to meet him with his main bombardment force, consisting of the fast battleship , the heavy cruisers and , and a destroyer screen. While en route, TG 16.3 was re-designated as TF 64 on 14 November; the ships passed to the south of Guadalcanal and then rounded the western end of the island to block Kondō&#x27;s expected route. Japanese aircraft reported sighting Lee&#x27;s formation, but identification of the ships ranged from a group of cruisers and destroyers to aircraft carriers, causing confusion among the Japanese commanders. That evening, American reconnaissance aircraft spotted Japanese warships off Savo Island, prompting Lee to order his ships to general quarters. The four destroyers were arrayed ahead of the two battleships. The American task force, having been thrown together a day before, had not operated together as a unit, and both of the battleships had very limited experience shooting their main battery, particularly at night.

At around 23:00 on 14 November, the leading Japanese destroyers in a screening force commanded by Shintarō Hashimoto sent ahead of Kondō&#x27;s main force spotted Lee&#x27;s ships and turned about to warn Kondō, while &quot;Washington&quot;″s search radar picked up a Japanese cruiser and a destroyer at about the same time. The ships&#x27; fire control radars then began tracking the Japanese vessels and Lee ordered both of his battleships to open fire when ready. &quot;Washington&quot; fired first with her main battery at 23:17 at a range of while her secondary guns fired star shells to illuminate the targets, followed shortly by &quot;South Dakota&quot;. One of the Japanese destroyers, , revealed her position by opening fire on the American destroyer screen, allowing &quot;Washington&quot; to target her, inflicting serious damage that disabled her propulsion machinery and started a major fire.

Shortly thereafter, at about 23:30, an error in the electrical switchboard room knocked out power aboard &quot;South Dakota&quot;, disabling her radar systems and leaving the ship all but blind to the Japanese vessels approaching the force. By this time, Hashimoto&#x27;s ships had inflicted serious damage on the American destroyer screen; two of the destroyers were torpedoed (one of which, , survived until the following morning) and a third was destroyed by gunfire. &quot;Washington&quot; was now left essentially alone to engage the Japanese squadron, though they had yet to actually detect her presence. While &quot;Washington&quot;″s captain, Glenn B. Davis, kept his ship on the disengaged side of the flaming wrecks of the destroyer screen, &quot;South Dakota&quot; was forced to turn in front of one of the burning destroyers to avoid a collision, which backlit her to the Japanese ships, drawing their fire and allowing &quot;Washington&quot; to engage them undisturbed.

At 23:35, &quot;Washington&quot;″s SG radar detected Kondō&#x27;s main force and tracked them for the next twenty minutes. At 23:58, &quot;South Dakota&quot;″s power was restored and her radar picked up the Japanese ships less than ahead. Two minutes later, the leading Japanese ship, &quot;Atago&quot;, illuminated &quot;South Dakota&quot; with her search lights and the Japanese line promptly opened fire, scoring twenty-seven hits. &quot;Washington&quot;, still undetected, opened fire, allocating two of her 5-inch guns to engage &quot;Atago&quot; and two to fire star shells, while the rest joined her main battery in battering &quot;Kirishima&quot; at a range of . &quot;Washington&quot; scored probably nine 16-inch hits and as many as forty 5-inch hits, inflicting grievous damage. &quot;Kirishima&quot; was badly holed below the waterline, her forward two turrets were knocked out, and her rudder was jammed, forcing her to steer in a circle to port with an increasing starboard list.

&quot;Washington&quot; then shifted fire to &quot;Atago&quot; and &quot;Takao&quot;, and though straddled the former, failed to score any significant hits; the barrage nevertheless convinced both cruisers to turn off their search lights and reverse course in an attempt to launch torpedoes. At 00:13, the two cruisers fired a spread of sixteen Long Lance torpedoes at &quot;Washington&quot;, then about away, though they all missed. At 00:20, Lee turned his sole surviving combatant (he had ordered the surviving destroyers to disengage earlier in the engagement, and &quot;South Dakota&quot;″s captain, having determined that his ship had been damaged sufficiently to prevent her from taking further action, decided to break off as well) to close with Kondō&#x27;s cruisers. &quot;Atago&quot; and &quot;Takao&quot; briefly engaged with their main batteries and the former launched three more torpedoes, all of which missed. Kondō then ordered the light forces of his reconnaissance screen to make a torpedo attack, but Hashimoto&#x27;s ships were far out of position and were unable to comply. Rear Admiral Raizō Tanaka, who was escorting a supply convoy to Guadalcanal and had thus far not participated in the action, detached two destroyers to aid Kondō. When these ships arrived on the scene, Lee ordered &quot;Washington&quot; to turn to reverse course at 00:33 to avoid a possible torpedo attack from the destroyers.

Tanaka&#x27;s two destroyers closed to launch their torpedoes while &quot;Washington&quot; was disengaging, prompting her to take evasive maneuvers. While withdrawing to the south, Lee kept &quot;Washington&quot; far west of the damaged American warships so that any Japanese vessels pursuing him would not be drawn onto the damaged vessels. An hour later, Kondō cancelled the bombardment and attempted to contact &quot;Kirishima&quot;, but after failing to receive a response, sent destroyers to investigate the crippled battleship. She was found burning furiously, still turning slowly to port as progressively worsening flooding disabled her boilers. At 03:25, she capsized and sank; by this time, &quot;Ayanami&quot; had also been abandoned and sank as a result of the damage inflicted by &quot;Washington&quot;. By 09:00, &quot;Washington&quot; had formed back up with &quot;South Dakota&quot; and the destroyers &quot;Benham&quot; and to withdraw from the area. In addition to blocking Kondō&#x27;s planned bombardment, Lee had delayed Tanaka&#x27;s convoy late enough that the transports could not unload under cover of darkness, and so they were forced to beach themselves on the island, where they were repeatedly attacked and badly damaged by aircraft from &quot;Enterprise&quot; and Henderson Field, field artillery, and the destroyer later that morning.

=====Later operations=====
&quot;Washington&quot; returned to screening the carriers of TF 11——and TF 16—&quot;Enterprise&quot;—while &quot;South Dakota&quot; departed for repairs. By late November, Lee&#x27;s command was reinforced by &quot;North Carolina&quot;, followed later by the battleship . These battleships were grouped together as TF 64, still under Lee&#x27;s command, and they covered convoys to support the fighting in the Solomons into the next year. These operations included covering a group of seven transports carrying elements of the 25th Infantry Division to Guadalcanal from 1 to 4 January 1943. During another of these convoy operations later that month, Lee&#x27;s battleships were too far south to be able to reach the American cruiser force during the Battle of Rennell Island. &quot;Washington&quot; remained in the south Pacific until 30 April, when she departed Nouméa for Pearl Harbor. On the way, she joined the ships of TF 16. The ships arrived on 8 May.

For the next twenty days, &quot;Washington&quot; operated as the flagship of TF 60, which conducted combat training off the coast of Hawaii. On 28 May, she went into dry dock at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard for repairs and installation of new equipment. This included a new set of screws that again failed to remediate the vibration problems. Once this work was completed, she resumed training exercises in the area until 27 July, when she got underway with a convoy bound for the south Pacific. For the voyage, she was attached to TG 56.14, and on arriving in the area was detached on 5 August to proceed independently to Havannah Harbor at Efate in the New Hebrides, which she reached two days later. &quot;Washington&quot; spent the next two months conducting tactical training with the carrier task forces in the Efate area in preparation for upcoming campaigns in the central Pacific.

Now part of TG 53.2, which included three other battleships and six destroyers, &quot;Washington&quot; got underway on 31 October. The ships met TG 53.3, centered on the carriers &quot;Enterprise&quot;, , and , the next day, for extensive training exercises that lasted until 5 November. The groups then dispersed and &quot;Washington&quot; left with escorting destroyers for Viti Levu in the Fiji Islands, which she reached on 7 November.

====Gilberts and Marshall Islands campaign====

&quot;Washington&quot;, still Lee&#x27;s flagship, sortied on 11 November in company with the ships of BatDivs 8 and 9, and four days later they joined TG 50.1, centered on the carrier . The fleet proceeded on to the Gilbert Islands, where marines were preparing to land on Tarawa. The carriers of TF 50 launched their strikes on 19 November, continuing into the next day as the marines went ashore on Tarawa and Makin. The attacks continued through 22 November, when the fleet steamed to the north of Makin to patrol the area. On 25 November, the groups of TF 50 were reorganized and &quot;Washington&quot; was transferred to TG 50.4, along with the carriers and and the battleships &quot;South Dakota&quot; and .

From 26 to 28 November, the carrier groups operated off Makin to cover the landing of troops and supplies on the island. Japanese aircraft attacked the groups on 27 and 28 November, but they inflicted little damage on the American ships. On 6 December, with the fighting in the Gilberts over, &quot;Washington&quot; was detached to create TG 50.8 along with &quot;North Carolina&quot;, &quot;South Dakota&quot;, &quot;Alabama&quot;, &quot;Indiana&quot;, and , covered by &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;, &quot;Monterey&quot;, and eleven destroyers. The battleships were sent to bombard the island of Nauru two days later, thereafter returning to Efate on 12 December. The ships remained there only briefly before departing on 25 December for gunnery training with &quot;North Carolina&quot; and four destroyers. The ships returned to port on 7 January 1944, at which time &quot;Washington&quot; was assigned to TG 37.2, along with &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; and &quot;Monterey&quot;. The ships got underway on 18 January, bound for the next target in the campaign: the Marshall Islands.

The ships stopped briefly in Funafuti in the Ellice Islands on 20 January before departing three days later to meet the rest of what was now TF 58; the unit, which comprised the fast carrier task force, had been created under the command of Rear Admiral Marc Mitscher on 6 January. &quot;Washington&quot;″s unit was accordingly re-numbered as TG 58.1. Having arrived off the main target at Kwajalein by late January, &quot;Washington&quot; screened the carriers while they conducted extensive strikes on the island and neighboring Taroa. On 30 January, &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, and &quot;Indiana&quot; were detached from the carriers to bombard Kwajalein with an escort of four destroyers. After returning to the carriers the next day, the battleships resumed guard duty while the carriers resumed their air strikes.
While patrolling off the island in the early hours of 1 February, &quot;Indiana&quot; cut in front of &quot;Washington&quot; to go refuel a group of destroyers, causing the latter to ram the former and significantly damaging both ships. &quot;Indiana&quot; had some of plating torn from her hull, and &quot;Washington&quot;″s bow collapsed. The two vessels withdrew to Majuro for temporary repairs; &quot;Washington&quot;″s crumpled bow was reinforced to allow her to steam to Pearl Harbor on 11 February for further temporary repairs. After arriving there, she was fitted with a temporary bow before continuing on to the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Bremerton, Washington, for permanent repairs. Another new set of screws was installed and in April, &quot;Washington&quot; conducted vibration tests that revealed a partial solution: the ship could now steam at high speed without significant issues, but vibration was still excessive at speeds between . Once the work was completed, the ship joined BatDiv 4 and took on a group of 500 passengers before departing for Pearl Harbor. She arrived there on 13 May and disembarked the passengers and proceeding back to the fleet at Majuro. On arrival on 7 June, she resumed her service as now-Vice Admiral Lee&#x27;s flagship.

====Mariana and Palau Islands campaign====

Shortly after &quot;Washington&quot; arrived, the fleet got underway to begin the assault on the Mariana Islands; the carriers struck targets on Saipan, Tinian, Guam, Rota, and Pagan to weaken Japanese defenses before ground forces went ashore. At the time, she was assigned to TG 58.7, which consisted of seven fast battleships, was distributed between the four carrier task groups. On 13 June, &quot;Washington&quot; and several other battleships were detached to bombard Saipan and Tinian before being relieved by the amphibious force&#x27;s bombardment group the next day. On 15 June, the fast carrier task force steamed north to hit targets in the Volcano and Bonin Islands, including Iwo Jima, Chichi Jima, and Haha Jima. At the same time, marines stormed the beaches on Saipan; landing was a breach of Japan&#x27;s inner defensive perimeter that triggered the Japanese fleet to launch a major counter-thrust with the 1st Mobile Fleet, the main carrier strike force.

Ozawa&#x27;s departure was observed by the American submarine ; other submarines, including and , tracked the Japanese fleet as it approached, keeping Admiral Raymond Spruance, the Fifth Fleet commander, informed of their movements. As the Japanese fleet approached, &quot;Washington&quot; and the rest of TF 58 steamed to meet it on 18 June, leading to the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19–20 June. &quot;Washington&quot; and the other battleships, with four cruisers and thirteen destroyers, were deployed some west of the carrier groups to screen the likely path of approach. The Japanese launched their aircraft first, and as they probed the American fleet&#x27;s defenses, &quot;Washington&quot; and &quot;North Carolina&quot; were the first battleships to open fire on the attacking Japanese aircraft. During the action, which was fought primarily by the carriers, the US fleet inflicted serious losses on the Japanese, destroying hundreds of their aircraft and sinking three carriers.

With the 1st Mobile Fleet defeated and withdrawing, &quot;Washington&quot; and the rest of TF 58 returned to the Marianas. She continued to screen the carriers during the Battle of Guam until 25 July, when &quot;Washington&quot; steamed with the carriers of TG 58.4 to raid the Palau Islands. The attacks lasted until 6 August, when &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;Indiana&quot;, &quot;Alabama&quot;, the light cruiser , and escorting destroyers were detached as TG 58.7 to proceed to Eniwetok. After arriving there on 11 August, the ships refueled and replenished ammunition and other supplies, remaining there for most of the month. On 30 August, the task group got underway with the rest of the fast carrier strike force, which by now had been transferred to Third Fleet command and renumbered TF 38. At this time, &quot;Washington&quot; was assigned to TG 38.3. The ships sailed first south to the Admiralty Islands and then west, back to the Palaus. There, the carriers began a series of strikes from 6 to 8 September on various targets in the Palaus; &quot;Washington&quot; contributed her heavy guns to the bombardment of Peleliu and Anguar before the marines assaulted both islands later that month.

On 9 and 10 September, task groups 38.1, 38.2, and 38.3 left the Palaus to raid Japanese airfields on Mindanao in the southern Philippines, part of the standard practice to neutralize nearby positions that could interfere with the upcoming assault on the Palaus. Finding few Japanese forces on the island, the carriers shifted north to the Visayas in the central Philippines from 12 to 14 September. The carrier groups then withdrew to refuel at sea before returning to the Philippines to attack airfields on Luzon from 21 and 22 September before making further attacks on installations in the Visayas on 24 September. The carrier groups then proceeded north to make a series of strikes on airfields in Okinawa, Formosa, and Luzon in preparation for the upcoming invasion of the Philippines.

====Philippines campaign====

TF 38 embarked on the raids to isolate the Philippines and suppress the units of the 1st Air Fleet on 6 October; &quot;Washington&quot; remained Lee&#x27;s flagship, attached to TG 38.3. The first operation was a major strike on Japanese air bases on the island of Okinawa on 10 October. The next day, the ships of TG 38.3 refueled at sea before joining the other three task groups for major raids on Formosa that took place from 12 to 14 October. As the fleet withdrew the next day, it defended itself against heavy Japanese air attacks, though the ships of TG 38.3 were not directly engaged as the Japanese attacks concentrated on task groups 38.1 and 38.4. On the 16th, a submarine reported observing a Japanese squadron consisting of three cruisers and eight destroyers searching for damaged Allied warships, and TG 38.3 and TG 38.2 steamed north to catch them, but the aircraft were only able to locate and sink a torpedo boat.

On 17 October, the two task groups withdrew to the south to cover the invasion of Leyte with the rest of TF 38, the same day that elements of Sixth Army went ashore; the raids on Luzon continued into 19 October. By this time, &quot;Washington&quot; had been reassigned to TG 38.4, screening &quot;Enterprise&quot;, the fleet carrier , and the light carriers and . On 21 October, TG 38.4 withdrew to refuel, during which time they also covered the withdrawal of ships that had been damaged during the Formosa raid, which were still on their way to Ulithi. TG 38.4 was recalled to Leyte the next day.

=====Battle of Leyte Gulf=====
The landing on Leyte led to the activation of Operation Shō-Gō 1, the Japanese navy&#x27;s planned riposte to an Allied landing in the Philippines. The plan was a complicated operation with three separate fleets: The 1st Mobile Fleet, now labeled the Northern Force under Jisaburō Ozawa, the Center Force under Takeo Kurita, and the Southern Force under Shōji Nishimura. Ozawa&#x27;s carriers, by now depleted of most of their aircraft, were to serve as a decoy for Kurita&#x27;s and Nishimura&#x27;s battleships, which were to use the distraction to attack the invasion fleet directly. Kurita&#x27;s ships were detected in the San Bernardino Strait on 24 October, and in the ensuing Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, American carrier aircraft sank the powerful battleship , causing Kurita to temporarily reverse course. This convinced Admiral William F. Halsey, the commander of Third Fleet, to send the fast carrier task force to destroy the 1st Mobile Fleet, which had by then been detected. &quot;Washington&quot; steamed north with the carriers, and on the way Halsey established TF 34, under Lee&#x27;s command, consisting of &quot;Washington&quot; and five other fast battleships, seven cruisers, and eighteen destroyers.

On the morning of 25 October, Mitscher began his first attack on the Northern Force, initiating the Battle off Cape Engaño; over the course of six strikes on the Japanese fleet, the Americans sank all four carriers and damaged two old battleships that had been converted into hybrid carriers. Unknown to Halsey and Mitscher, Kurita had resumed his approach through the San Bernardino Strait late on 24 October and passed into Leyte Gulf the next morning. While Mitscher was occupied with the decoy Northern Force, Kurita moved in to attack the invasion fleet; in the Battle off Samar, he was held off by a group of escort carriers, destroyers, and destroyer escorts, TU 77.4.3, known as Taffy 3. Frantic calls for help later that morning led Halsey to detach Lee&#x27;s battleships to head south and intervene.

However, Halsey waited more than an hour after receiving orders from Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, the Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet, to detach TF 34; still steaming north during this interval, the delay added two hours to the battleships&#x27; voyage south. A need to refuel destroyers further slowed TF 34&#x27;s progress south. Heavy resistance from Taffy 3 threw Kurita&#x27;s battleships and cruisers into disarray and led him to break off the attack before &quot;Washington&quot; and the rest of TF 34 could arrive. Halsey detached the battleships and as TG 34.5 to pursue Kurita through the San Bernardino Strait while Lee took the rest of his ships further southwest to try to cut off his escape, but both groups arrived too late. The historian H. P. Wilmott speculated that had Halsey detached TF 34 promptly and not delayed the battleships by refueling the destroyers, the ships could have easily arrived in the strait ahead of Center Force and, owing to the marked superiority of their radar-directed main guns, destroyed Kurita&#x27;s ships.

=====Later operations=====
After the battle, the units of TF 38 withdrew to Ulithi to replenish fuel and ammunition for further operations in the Philippines. The carrier task forces got underway again on 2 November for more strikes on the airfields on Luzon and the Visayas that continued until 14 November, when they withdrew again to Ulithi, arriving there three days later. On 18 November, Lee exchanged flagships with Rear Admiral Edward Hanson, the commander of BatDiv 9, who had used &quot;South Dakota&quot; as his flagship. At the same time, &quot;Washington&quot; was transferred to TG 38.3, in company with &quot;South Dakota&quot; and &quot;North Carolina&quot;. The ships sortied on 22 November for gunnery training while the carriers conducted strikes independently against targets in the Philippines over the next three days. She arrived back in Ulithi on 2 December, where the crew made repairs and loaded ammunition and stores for future operations.

The units of TF 38 got underway again on 11 December for more attacks on Luzon to suppress Japanese aircraft as the amphibious force prepared for its next landing on the island of Mindoro in the western Philippines. The raid lasted from 14 to 16 December, and while the fleet withdrew to refuel on 17 December, Typhoon Cobra swept through the area, battering the fleet and sinking three destroyers. The damage inflicted on the fleet delayed further support of ground troops for two days and the continuing bad weather led Halsey to break off operations; the ships arrived back in Ulithi on 24 December.

On 30 December, the fleet got underway to make preparatory strikes for the landing on Luzon; &quot;Washington&quot; remained with TG 38.3 for the operation. The carriers struck Formosa again on 3 and 4 January 1945; after refueling at sea on 5 January, the carriers struck kamikazes massed at airfields on Luzon on 6 and 7 January to neutralize them before the invasion of Lingayen Gulf. Further attacks on Formosa and Okinawa followed on 9 January. The next day, the carrier groups entered the South China Sea, where it refueled and then struck targets in French Indochina on the assumption that significant Japanese naval forces were present, but only merchant ships and a number of minor warships were caught and sunk there. During these raids, other elements of the Allied fleet invaded Lingayen Gulf on Luzon.

==== Iwo Jima and Okinawa campaigns ====
In February, she escorted carriers during attacks on the Japanese island of Honshu to disrupt Japanese air forces that might interfere with the planned invasion of Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands. Fifth Fleet had re-assumed command of the fast carrier task force by this point, and &quot;Washington&quot; was now part of TG 58.4. The fleet sortied from Ulithi on 10 February, and after conducting training exercises off Tinian on the 12th, refueled at sea on 14 February and continued on north to launch strikes on the Tokyo area two days later. The raids continued through 17 February and the next day, the fleet withdrew to refuel and TG 58.4 was sent to hit other islands in the Bonin chain to further isolate Iwo Jima. During the preparatory bombardment for that attack, &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;North Carolina&quot;, and the heavy cruiser were detached from the task group to reinforce TF 54, the assault force for the invasion; she remained on station during the marine assault and provided fire support as they fought their way across the island through 22 February. The next day, the carrier groups reassembled and refueled on 24 February for further operations against the Japanese mainland.

After leaving Iwo Jima, the fleet resumed air attacks on the Home Islands to prepare for the next amphibious assault on Okinawa in the Ryukus. The first of these, on 25 and 26 February, hit targets in the Tokyo area, followed by another attack on Iwo Jima the next day. The fleet refueled on 28 February and on 1 March raided Okinawa, thereafter returning to Ulithi on 4 March. While in Ulithi, the fleet was reorganized and &quot;Washington&quot; was transferred to TG 58.3. The fleet sortied on 14 March for additional attacks on Japan; the ships refueled on 16 March on the way and they launched their aircraft two days later to hit targets in Kyushu. The attacks continued into the next day, causing significant damage to Japanese facilities on the island and sinking or damaging numerous warships. The task groups withdrew to refuel and reorganize on 22 March, as several carriers had been damaged by kamikaze and air attacks.

On 24 March, &quot;Washington&quot; bombarded Japanese positions on Okinawa as the fleet continued to pummel defenses before the invasion. By this time, &quot;Washington&quot; had been transferred to TG 58.2. Carrier raids on the Home Islands and the Ryukus continued after landing on Okinawa on 1 April. While operating off the island, the fleet came under heavy and repeated kamikaze attacks, one of the largest of which took place on 7 April in concert with the sortie of the battleship . &quot;Washington&quot; was not damaged in these attacks, however, which were largely defeated by the carriers&#x27; combat air patrols. On 19 April, the battleship again closed with Okinawa to bombard Japanese positions as the Marines fought their way south. &quot;Washington&quot; remained off the island until late May, when she was detached for an overhaul. She proceeded first to San Pedro Bay, Leyte, arriving there on 1 June, before departing for Puget Sound on 6 June. While crossing the Pacific, she stopped in Guam and Pearl Harbor before finally arriving in Bremerton on 23 June. Her refit continued into September, by which time Japan had surrendered on 15 August and formally ended the war on 2 September.

=== Post-war ===

After completing her refit in September, &quot;Washington&quot; conducted sea trials, followed by a short period of training while based in San Pedro, Los Angeles. She then got underway for the Panama Canal and on 6 October joined TG 11.6 on the way, thereafter passing through the canal and steaming north to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. She arrived there on 17 October and took part in Navy Day celebrations on 27 October. Slated to take part in Operation Magic Carpet, the sea-lift operation to bring American service members home, &quot;Washington&quot; went into the shipyard in Philadelphia to be modified to carry additional personnel. Additional space was provided by substantially reducing the crew, to 84 officers and 835 enlisted men; with the war over, the ship&#x27;s weapons needed no gun crews. The work was completed by 15 November, when she got underway for Britain. She arrived in Southampton on 22 November. &quot;Washington&quot; embarked a contingent of Army personnel totaling 185 officers and 1,479 enlisted men and then re-crossed the Atlantic to New York, where she was decommissioned on 27 June 1947.

She was assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, based in New York, where she remained through the 1950s. Beginning already in 1946, the Ships Characteristics Board authorized the removal a number of the 40 mm guns from the &quot;North Carolina&quot; and &quot;South Dakota&quot; class battleships that had been decommissioned. These guns were then installed on the s when they were reactivated for the Korean War. &quot;Washington&quot; and the other battleships had their 20 mm batteries removed entirely by October 1951. The Navy considered modernizing &quot;Washington&quot; and &quot;North Carolina&quot; in May 1954, which would have provided an anti-aircraft battery of twelve guns in twin turrets. The ships&#x27; slow speed prevented them from effectively serving with the carrier task forces and the Navy determined that a speed of would be necessary. To achieve this, the power plant would have to provide at the current displacement; even removing the aft turret and using that magazine space for additional boilers would not have produced the necessary power. By removing all of the belt armor, the ship would have only required to reach the desired speed, but the aft hull would have had to have been significantly rebuilt to accommodate the larger screws that would have been required. The Navy considered the possibility of removing the ships&#x27; current propulsion system altogether and replacing it with the same type as used in the &quot;Iowa&quot;s, which were capable of , but there was not enough room to fit the larger system. To reach the same speed, &quot;Washington&quot; would have needed to have all side armor and all three turrets removed in addition to a power plant capable of .

The cost of the project, estimated at around $40 million per ship, was deemed to be prohibitively expensive and so the project was abandoned. The ship remained in the inventory until 1 June 1960, when the ship was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. She was sold for scrap on 24 May 1961. &quot;Washington&quot; was towed to the Lipsett Division of Luria Brothers and broken up thereafter.

<text>Magi (), or magus (), is the term for priests in Zoroastrianism and earlier Iranian religions. The earliest known use of the word &quot;magi&quot; is in the trilingual inscription written by Darius the Great, known as the Behistun Inscription. Old Persian texts, predating the Hellenistic period, refer to a magus as a Zurvanic, and presumably Zoroastrian, priest.

Pervasive throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and West Asia until late antiquity and beyond, &quot;mágos&quot; (μάγος) was influenced by (and eventually displaced) Greek &quot;goēs&quot; (γόης), the older word for a practitioner of magic, with a meaning expanded to include astronomy, astrology, alchemy, and other forms of esoteric knowledge. This association was in turn the product of the Hellenistic fascination for Pseudo-Zoroaster, who was perceived by the Greeks to be the Chaldean founder of the Magi and inventor of both astrology and magic, a meaning that still survives in the modern-day words &quot;magic&quot; and &quot;magician&quot;.

In the Gospel of Matthew, &quot;μάγοι&quot; (&quot;magoi&quot;) from the east do homage to the Christ Child, and the transliterated plural &quot;magi&quot; entered English from Latin in this context around 1200 AD (this particular use is also commonly rendered in English as &quot;kings&quot; and more often in recent times as &quot;wise men&quot;). The singular &quot;magus&quot; appears considerably later, when it was borrowed from Old French in the late 14th century with the meaning &quot;magician&quot;.

Hereditary Zoroastrian priesthood has survived in India and Iran. They are termed Herbad, Mobad (Magupat, i.e. chief of the Maga), and Dastur depending on the rank.

== History ==

=== Iranian sources ===

The term only appears twice in Iranian texts from before the 5th century BC, and only one of these can be dated with precision. This one instance occurs in the trilingual Behistun inscription of Darius the Great, and which can be dated to about 520 BC. In this trilingual text, certain rebels have magian as an attribute; in the Old Persian portion as &quot;maγu-&quot; (generally assumed to be a loan word from Median). The meaning of the term in this context is uncertain.

The other instance appears in the texts of the Avesta, the sacred literature of Zoroastrianism. In this instance, which is in the Younger Avestan portion, the term appears in the hapax &quot;moghu.tbiš&quot;, meaning &quot;hostile to the &quot;moghu&quot;&quot;, where &quot;moghu&quot; does not (as was previously thought) mean &quot;magus&quot;, but rather &quot;a member of the tribe&quot; or referred to a particular social class in the proto-Iranian language and then continued to do so in Avestan.

An unrelated term, but previously assumed to be related, appears in the older Gathic Avestan language texts. This word, adjectival &quot;magavan&quot; meaning &quot;possessing &quot;maga-&quot;&quot;, was once the premise that Avestan &quot;maga-&quot; and Median (i.e. Old Persian) &quot;magu-&quot; were coeval (and also that both these were cognates of Vedic Sanskrit &quot;magha-&quot;). While &quot;in the Gathas the word seems to mean both the teaching of Zoroaster and the community that accepted that teaching&quot;, and it seems that Avestan &quot;maga-&quot; is related to Sanskrit &quot;magha-&quot;, &quot;there is no reason to suppose that the western Iranian form &quot;magu&quot; (Magus) has exactly the same meaning&quot; as well. But it &quot;may be, however&quot;, that Avestan &quot;moghu&quot; (which is not the same as Avestan &quot;maga-&quot;) &quot;and Medean &quot;magu&quot; were the same word in origin, a common Iranian term for &#x27;member of the tribe&#x27; having developed among the Medes the special sense of &#x27;member of &quot;the&quot; (priestly) tribe&#x27;, hence a priest.&quot;&quot;cf&quot;

Some examples of the use of magi in Persian poetry, are present in the poems of Hafez. There are two frequent terms used by him, first one is &quot;Peer-e Moghan&quot; (literally &quot;the old man of the magi&quot;) and second one is &quot;Deyr-e Moghan&quot; (literally &quot;the monastery of the magi&quot;).

=== Greco-Roman sources ===

==== Hellenistic period ====
The oldest surviving Greek reference to the magi – from Greek (&quot;mágos&quot;, plural: &quot;magoi&quot;) – might be from 6th century BC Heraclitus (apud Clemens &quot;Protrepticus&quot; 2.22.2), who curses the magi for their &quot;impious&quot; rites and rituals. A description of the rituals that Heraclitus refers to has not survived, and there is nothing to suggest that Heraclitus was referring to foreigners.

Better preserved are the descriptions of the mid-5th century BC Herodotus, who in his portrayal of the Iranian expatriates living in Asia Minor uses the term &quot;magi&quot; in two different senses. In the first sense (&quot;Histories&quot; 1.101), Herodotus speaks of the magi as one of the tribes/peoples (&quot;ethnous&quot;) of the Medes. In another sense (1.132), Herodotus uses the term &quot;magi&quot; to generically refer to a &quot;sacerdotal caste&quot;, but &quot;whose ethnic origin is never again so much as mentioned.&quot; According to Robert Charles Zaehner, in other accounts :&quot;We hear of Magi not only in Persia, Parthia, Bactria, Chorasmia, Aria, Media, and among the Sakas, but also in non-Iranian lands like Arabia, Ethiopia, and Egypt. Their influence was also widespread throughout Asia Minor.It is, therefore, quite likely that the sacerdotal caste of the Magi was distinct from the Median tribe of the same name.&quot;As early as the 5th century BC, Greek &quot;magos&quot; had spawned &quot;mageia&quot; and &quot;&quot; to describe the activity of a magus, that is, it was his or her art and practice. But almost from the outset the noun for the action and the noun for the actor parted company. Thereafter, &quot;mageia&quot; was used not for what actual magi did, but for something related to the word &#x27;magic&#x27; in the modern sense, i.e. using supernatural means to achieve an effect in the natural world, or the appearance of achieving these effects through trickery or sleight of hand. The early Greek texts typically have the pejorative meaning, which in turn influenced the meaning of &quot;magos&quot; to denote a conjurer and a charlatan. Already in the mid-5th century BC, Herodotus identifies the &quot;magi&quot; as interpreters of omens and dreams (&quot;Histories&quot; 7.19, 7.37, 1.107, 1.108, 1.120, 1.128).

Other Greek sources from before the Hellenistic period include the gentleman-soldier Xenophon, who had first-hand experience at the Persian Achaemenid court. In his early 4th century BC &quot;Cyropaedia&quot;, Xenophon depicts the magians as authorities for all religious matters (8.3.11), and imagines the magians to be responsible for the education of the emperor-to-be. Apuleius, a Numidian Platonist philosopher, describes magus to be considered as a &quot;sage and philosopher-king&quot; based on its Platonic notion.

==== Roman period ====
Once the magi had been associated with &quot;magic&quot; – Greek &quot;&quot; – it was but a natural progression that the Greeks&#x27; image of Zoroaster would metamorphose into a magician too. The first century Pliny the Elder names &quot;Zoroaster&quot; as the inventor of magic (&quot;Natural History&quot; xxx.2.3), but a &quot;principle of the division of labor appears to have spared Zoroaster most of the responsibility for introducing the dark arts to the Greek and Roman worlds. That dubious honor went to another fabulous magus, Ostanes, to whom most of the pseudepigraphic magical literature was attributed.&quot; For Pliny, this magic was a &quot;monstrous craft&quot; that gave the Greeks not only a &quot;lust&quot; (&quot;aviditatem&quot;) for magic, but a downright &quot;madness&quot; (&quot;rabiem&quot;) for it, and Pliny supposed that Greek philosophers – among them Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus, and Plato – traveled abroad to study it, and then returned to teach it (xxx.2.8–10).

&quot;Zoroaster&quot; – or rather what the Greeks supposed him to be – was for the Hellenists the figurehead of the &#x27;magi&#x27;, and the founder of that order (or what the Greeks considered to be an order). He was further projected as the author of a vast compendium of &quot;Zoroastrian&quot; pseudepigrapha, composed in the main to discredit the texts of rivals. &quot;The Greeks considered the best wisdom to be exotic wisdom&quot; and &quot;what better and more convenient authority than the distant – temporally and geographically – Zoroaster?&quot; The subject of these texts, the authenticity of which was rarely challenged, ranged from treatises on nature to ones on necromancy. But the bulk of these texts dealt with astronomical speculations and magical lore.

One factor for the association with astrology was Zoroaster&#x27;s name, or rather, what the Greeks made of it. His name was identified at first with star-worshiping (&quot;&quot; &quot;star sacrificer&quot;) and, with the &quot;Zo-&quot;, even as the &quot;living&quot; star. Later, an even more elaborate mytho-etymology evolved: Zoroaster died by the living (&quot;zo-&quot;) flux (&quot;-ro-&quot;) of fire from the star (&quot;-astr-&quot;) which he himself had invoked, and even that the stars killed him in revenge for having been restrained by him. The second, and &quot;more serious&quot; factor for the association with astrology was the notion that Zoroaster was a Chaldean. The alternate Greek name for Zoroaster was Zaratas / Zaradas / Zaratos (&quot;cf.&quot; Agathias 2.23–25, Clement &quot;Stromata&quot; I.15), which – according to Bidez and Cumont – derived from a Semitic form of his name. The Suda&#x27;s chapter on &quot;astronomia&quot; notes that the Babylonians learned their astrology from Zoroaster. Lucian of Samosata (&quot;Mennipus&quot; 6) decides to journey to Babylon &quot;to ask one of the magi, Zoroaster&#x27;s disciples and successors&quot;, for their opinion.

== Religious traditions ==

=== Abrahamic ===

==== Judaism ====
In the Talmud, instances of dialogue between the Jewish sages and various magi are recorded. The Talmud depicts the Magi as sorcerers and in several descriptions, they are negatively described as obstructing Jewish religious practices. Several references include the sages criticizing practices performed by various magi. One instance is a description of the Zoroastrian priests exhuming corpses for their burial practices which directly interfered with the Jewish burial rites. Another instance is a sage forbidding learning from the magi.

==== Christianity ====
 

The word &quot;mágos&quot; (Greek) and its variants appear in both the Old and New Testaments. Ordinarily this word is translated &quot;magician&quot; or &quot;sorcerer&quot; in the sense of illusionist or fortune-teller, and this is how it is translated in all of its occurrences (e.g. Acts 13:6) except for the Gospel of Matthew, where, depending on translation, it is rendered &quot;wise man&quot; (KJV, RSV) or left untranslated as &quot;Magi&quot;, typically with an explanatory note (NIV). However, early church fathers, such as St. Justin, Origen, St. Augustine and St. Jerome, did not make an exception for the Gospel, and translated the word in its ordinary sense, i.e. as &quot;magician&quot;. The Gospel of Matthew states that magi visited the infant Jesus to do him homage shortly after his birth (). The gospel describes how magi from the east were notified of the birth of a king in Judaea by the appearance of his star. Upon their arrival in Jerusalem, they visited King Herod to determine the location of the king of the Jews&#x27; birthplace. Herod, disturbed, told them that he had not heard of the child, but informed them of a prophecy that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem. He then asked the magi to inform him when they find the child so that he himself may also pay homage to the child. Guided by the Star of Bethlehem, the wise men found the infant Jesus in a house. They paid homage to him, and presented him with &quot;gifts of gold and of frankincense and of myrrh.&quot; (2.11) In a dream they are warned not to return to Herod, and therefore return to their homes by taking another route. Since its composition in the late 1st century, numerous apocryphal stories have embellished the gospel&#x27;s account. Matthew 2:16 implies that Herod learned from the wise men that up to two years had passed since the birth, which is why all male children two years or younger were slaughtered.

In addition to the more famous story of Simon Magus found in chapter 8, the &quot;Book of Acts&quot; () also describes another magus who acted as an advisor of Sergius Paulus, the Roman proconsul at Paphos on the island of Cyprus, a Jew named Bar-Iesous (son of Jesus), or alternatively Elymas. (Another Cypriot magus named Atomos is referenced by Josephus, working at the court of Felix at Caesarea.)

One of the non-canonical Christian sources, the Syriac Infancy Gospel, provides, in its third chapter, a story of the wise men of the East which is very similar to much of the story in Matthew. This account cites Zoradascht (Zoroaster) as the source of the prophecy that motivated the wise men to seek the infant Jesus.

==== Islam ====

In Arabic, &quot;Magians&quot; (&quot;majus&quot;) is the term for Zoroastrians. The term is mentioned in the Quran, in sura 22 verse 17, where the &quot;Magians&quot; are mentioned alongside the Jews, the Sabians and the Christians in a list of religions who will be judged on the Day of Resurrection.

=== Eastern ===

==== Dharmic ====

In India, the Sakaldwipiya Brahmins are considered to be the descendants of the ten Maga (Sanskrit ) priests who were invited to conduct worship of Mitra (Surya) at Mitravana (Multan), as described in the Samba Purana, Bhavishya Purana and the Mahabharata. Their original home was a mythological region called Śākadvīpa. According to Varahamihira (c. 505 – c. 587), the statue of the Sun god (Mitra), is represented as wearing the &quot;northern&quot; (Central Asian) dress, specifically with horse riding boots. Some Brahmin communities of India trace their descent from the Magas. Some classical astronomers and mathematicians of India such are Varahamihira are considered to be the descendants of the Magas.

Varahamihira specifies that installation and consecration of the Sun images should be done by the Magas. al-Biruni mentions that the priests of the Sun Temple at Multan were Magas. The Magas had colonies in a number of places in India, and were the priests at Konark, Martanda and other sun temples.

==== Chinese shamanism ====

Victor H. Mair (1990) suggested that Chinese &quot;wū&quot; (巫 &quot;shaman; witch, wizard; magician&quot;) may originate as a loanword from Old Persian *&quot;maguš&quot; &quot;magician; magi&quot;. Mair reconstructs an Old Chinese *&#x27;. The reconstruction of Old Chinese forms is somewhat speculative. The velar final &quot;-g&quot; in Mair&#x27;s *&#x27; (巫) is evident in several Old Chinese reconstructions (Dong Tonghe&#x27;s *&quot;mywag&quot;, Zhou Fagao&#x27;s *&quot;mjwaγ&quot;, and Li Fanggui&#x27;s *&quot;mjag&quot;), but not all (Bernhard Karlgren&#x27;s *&quot;mywo&quot; and Axel Schuessler&#x27;s *&quot;ma&quot;).

Mair adduces the discovery of two figurines with unmistakably Caucasoid or Europoid features dated to the 8th century BC, found in a 1980 excavation of a Zhou dynasty palace in Fufeng County, Shaanxi Province. One of the figurines is marked on the top of its head with an incised ☩ graph.

Mair&#x27;s suggestion is based on a proposal by Jao Tsung-I (1990), which connects the &quot;cross potent&quot; bronzeware script glyph for &quot;wu&quot; with the same shape found in Neolithic West Asia, specifically a cross potent carved in the shoulder of a goddess figure of the Halaf period.

== Usage in contemporary times ==
In the 1980s, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Ba&#x27;ath Party used the quranic term &quot;majus&quot; during the Iran–Iraq War as an ethnic slur against Iranians, both verbally and even in official documents. A 2000 paper elaborated the usage&#x27;s propaganda significance:&quot;By referring to the Iranians in these documents as &quot;majus&quot;, the security apparatus [implied] that the Iranians [were] not sincere Muslims, but rather covertly practice their pre-Islamic beliefs. Thus, in their eyes, Iraq&#x27;s war took on the dimensions of not only a struggle for Arab nationalism, but also a campaign in the name of Islam.&quot;

<text>Dion Fortune (born Violet Mary Firth, 6 December 1890 – 6 or 8 January 1946) was a British occultist, ceremonial magician, novelist and author. She was a co-founder of the Fraternity of the Inner Light, an occult organisation that promoted philosophies which she claimed had been taught to her by spiritual entities known as the Ascended Masters. A prolific writer, she produced a large number of articles and books on her occult ideas and also authored seven novels, several of which expound occult themes.

Fortune was born in Llandudno, Caernarfonshire, North Wales, to a wealthy upper middle-class English family, although little is known of her early life. By her teenage years she was living in England&#x27;s West Country, where she wrote two books of poetry. After time spent at a horticultural college she began studying psychology and psychoanalysis at the University of London before working as a counsellor in a psychotherapy clinic. During the First World War she joined the Women&#x27;s Land Army and established a company selling soy milk products. She became interested in esotericism through the teachings of the Theosophical Society, before joining an occult lodge led by Theodore Moriarty and then the Alpha et Omega occult organisation.

She came to believe that she was being contacted by two Ascended Masters, the Master Rakoczi and the Master Jesus, and underwent trance mediumship to channel the Masters&#x27; messages. In 1922 Fortune and Charles Loveday claimed that during one of these ceremonies they were contacted by Masters who provided them with a text, &quot;The Cosmic Doctrine&quot;. Although she became the president of the Christian Mystic Lodge of the Theosophical Society, she believed the society to be uninterested in Christianity, and split from it to form the Community of the Inner Light, a group later renamed the Fraternity of the Inner Light. With Loveday she established bases in both Glastonbury and Bayswater, London, began issuing a magazine, gave public lectures, and promoted the growth of their society. During the Second World War she organised a project of meditations and visualisations designed to protect Britain. She began planning for what she believed was a coming post-war Age of Aquarius, although she died of leukemia shortly after the war&#x27;s end.

Fortune is recognised as one of the most significant occultists and ceremonial magicians of the early 20th century. The Fraternity she founded survived her and in later decades spawned a variety of related groups based upon her teachings. Her novels in particular proved an influence on later occult and modern Pagan groups such as Wicca.

==Biography==

===Early life: 1890–1913===

Fortune was born Violet Mary Firth on 6 December 1890 at her family home on Bryn-y-Bia Road in Llandudno, North Wales. Her background was upper middle-class; the Firths were a wealthy English family who had gained their money through the steel industry in Sheffield, Yorkshire, where they had specialised in the production of guns. Fortune&#x27;s paternal grandfather John Firth had devised a family motto, &quot;Deo, non Fortuna&quot; (&quot;God, not Luck&quot;), to mark out their &quot;nouveau riche&quot; status; she would later make use of it in creating her pseudonym.

One of John&#x27;s sons – and Fortune&#x27;s uncle – was the historian Charles Harding Firth, while her father, Arthur, had run a Sheffield law firm prior to establishing a hydropathic establishment in Limpley Stoke, Wiltshire. In August 1886 Arthur Firth married Sarah Jane Smith, before they relocated to Llandudno where Arthur established the new Craigside Hydrotherapeutic Establishment. Sarah was keenly interested in Christian Science, and Gareth Knight notes that both of Firth&#x27;s parents were active practitioners of the religion, while fellow biographer Alan Richardson expresses doubt that there was sufficient evidence as to the seriousness with which Fortune herself regarded it.

Little is known about Fortune&#x27;s time in Wales, in part because throughout her life she was deliberately elusive when providing biographical details about herself. In later life she reported that from the age of four she had experienced visions of Atlantis, something which she believed were past life memories. The Firths were still in Llandudno in 1900, although by 1904 Fortune was living in Somerset, south-west England. That year, she authored a book of poetry, titled &quot;Violets&quot;, which was likely published by her family. It was reviewed in the May 1905 volume of &quot;The Girls&#x27; Room&quot;, in which it was accompanied by the only known photograph of Fortune as a girl. In 1906, her second book of poetry, &quot;More Violets&quot;, was published.

After John Firth&#x27;s death, Arthur moved with his family to London. According to Richardson they lived in the area around Liverpool Street in the east of the city, although Knight gives a different account, stating that they lived first in Bedford Park and then Kensington, both in the west of the city. From January 1911 to December 1912 Fortune studied at Studley Agricultural College in Warwickshire, a horticultural institution which advertised itself as being ideal for girls with psychological problems. Her proficiency with poultry led her to become a staff member at the college from January to April 1913. She later claimed that at the college she was the victim of mental manipulation from her employer, the college warden Lillias Hamilton, resulting in a mental breakdown that made her abandon the institution and return to her parental home.

===Psychotherapy and esotericism: 1913–22===

To recover from her experience at Studley, Fortune began studying psychotherapy. Her initial interest was in the work of Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, though she later moved on to that of Carl Jung. She studied psychology and psychoanalysis under John Flügel at the University of London, before gaining employment at a psychology clinic in London&#x27;s Brunswick Square, which was likely run under the jurisdiction of the London School of Medicine for Women. Working as a counsellor from 1914 until 1916, she found that most of those she dealt with were coming to terms with sexual urges that were considered taboo in British society. Through her affiliation with the Society for the Study of Orthopsychics, she gave a series of lectures that were later published in 1922 as &quot;The Machinery of the Mind&quot;. While working at the clinic, she developed her interest in esotericism by attending lunchtime lectures organised by the Theosophical Society and reading some of the organisation&#x27;s literature. With her interest in occultism increasing, Fortune became increasingly dissatisfied with the effectiveness of psychotherapy.

After the United Kingdom entered the First World War, Fortune joined the Women&#x27;s Land Army. She was initially stationed on a farm near to Bishop&#x27;s Stortford on the borders between Essex and Hertfordshire, before later being relocated to an experimental base for the Food Production Department. There she carried out experiments in the production of soy milk, subsequently founding the Letchworth-based Garden City Pure Food Company to sell her products and publishing &quot;The Soya Bean: An Appeal to Humanitarians&quot; in 1925. It was while working at the base that she underwent a spiritual experience and subsequently further immersed herself in Theosophical literature. After doing so, she became preoccupied by the idea of the &#x27;Ascended Masters&#x27; or &#x27;Secret Chiefs&#x27;, claiming to have had visions of two such entities, the Master Jesus and the Master Rakoczi.

Her first magical mentor was the Irish occultist and Freemason Theodore Moriarty. She had befriended him while still involved in psychotherapy, believing that he could help one of her patients, a young man who had been fighting on the Western Front and claimed to be plagued by unexplained physical phenomena. Moriarty performed an exorcism, claiming that the young man was the victim of the soul of a deceased East European soldier which had latched onto him as a parasite. Fortune became an acolyte of Moriarty&#x27;s Masonic-influenced lodge, which was based in Hammersmith, and joined his community of followers living at Gwen Stafford-Allen&#x27;s home in Bishop&#x27;s Stortford. Moriarty spent much time talking about the lost city of Atlantis, a topic that would also come to be embraced by Fortune. Fortune later fictionalised Moriarty as the character Dr. Taverner, who appeared in a number of short stories first published in 1922, later assembled in a collected volume as &quot;The Secrets of Dr. Taverner&quot; in 1926. Like Moriarty, Dr. Taverner was portrayed as carrying out exorcisms to protect humans from the attacks of etheric vampires.

In tandem with her studies under Moriarty, in 1919 Fortune had been initiated into the London Temple of the Alpha et Omega, an occult group that had developed from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Here, her primary teacher was Maiya Curtis-Webb, a longstanding friend of the Firth family. Fortune later claimed that in the period after the First World War, the Order had been &quot;manned mainly by widows and grey-bearded ancients&quot;. She was not enamoured with the ceremonial magic system that had been developed by the Golden Dawn, however it did provide her with the grounding in the study of the Hermetic Qabalah which would exert a great influence over her esoteric world-view. It was also through her involvement in the group that she embraced her family&#x27;s &quot;Deo, non Fortuna&quot; as her personal magical motto. In January and March 1921 Fortune and Curtis-Webb embarked on a series of experiments in trance mediumship. This culminated in an act of trance mediumship that Fortune conducted in the Somerset town of Glastonbury with her mother and Frederick Bligh Bond. She claimed that in doing so, she had contacted spirit-entities known as &quot;the Watchers of Avalon&quot; who informed her that Glastonbury had once been the site of an ancient druidic college. Bond subsequently commissioned Fortune to write an article, &quot;Psychology and Occultism&quot;, which was published in the transactions of the College of Psychic Science in 1922.

===Glastonbury and &quot;The Cosmic Doctrine&quot;: 1922–26===

In September 1922, Fortune returned to Glastonbury to visit her friend Charles Loveday. Along with an anonymous woman known only as &quot;E. P.&quot;, the pair carried out acts of trance mediumship, claiming that in doing so they entered into psychic contact with the Ascended Masters; Fortune later identified these as Socrates, Thomas Erskine, and a young military officer named David Carstairs who had died at the Battle of Ypres. Fortune and Loveday characterised their method of communication as &quot;inspirational mediumship&quot;, believing that in this process the Masters communicated through the medium&#x27;s subconscious mind; they contrasted this with &quot;automatic mediumship&quot;, which they believed involved the medium becoming completely dissociated from their own body.

It was in this manner that Fortune and Loveday claimed that they received a text, &quot;The Cosmic Doctrine&quot;, which was dictated to them in segments by the Masters between July 1923 and February 1925. These communications discussed the existence of seven planes of the universe, and were very similar to the ideas promoted in Moriarty&#x27;s writings, in particular his &quot;Aphorism of Creation&quot; and &quot;Cosmic Principles&quot;. The cosmology present in this book was also similar to that presented in Theosophy. In the following years, Fortune distributed this material among her senior students, before publishing an edited version of &quot;The Cosmic Doctrine&quot; in 1949.

In August 1923 Moriarty died, and Fortune—who had never been particularly popular among his followers—tried to convince them that she should be their new leader. A few accepted her offer, but many others instead accepted the leadership of Stafford-Allen. Meanwhile, Fortune&#x27;s parents relocated to the garden city of Letchworth, Hertfordshire in 1922, and it was here that Fortune carried out what she deemed to be additional communications with the Masters through trance mediumship between 1923 and 1925.

On 20 August 1924, Fortune, Loveday, and others established themselves as a formal occult group. Fortune appointed herself as the group&#x27;s &quot;Adeptus&quot;, while five acolytes also joined. Loveday—who had inherited a number of properties from his father—sold some of them to fund the group&#x27;s acquisitions. That year, they purchased a house on Queensborough Terrace in Bayswater, Central London to use as a temple and headquarters, renting out some of the rooms to tenants to finance their operation. While the top floors were used as living quarters, the middle floor contained the temple space, and the lower floors held an office and private library. The group soon grew; it admitted four initiates in 1925, six in 1926, and ten in 1927. In November 1926, a second degree was established into which these initiates could progress. In 1924, the group also obtained an old orchard at the foot of Glastonbury Tor, there erecting a hut and eventually a veranda and series of chalets. At Whitsun 1926, Fortune and several other members of her group were on Glastonbury Tor when they underwent a spiritual experience that produced a feeling of ecstasy among them. They later came to believe that this experience was a result of a messenger from the Elemental Kingdoms, and it greatly influenced their developing beliefs.

Fortune&#x27;s activities—including her leadership of the new group and a series of articles that she wrote for &quot;The Occult Review&quot;—raised concerns for Alpha et Omega leader Moina Mathers. After Fortune suggested that her own organisation could serve as a feeder group to Mathers&#x27;s Alpha et Omega, Mathers expelled her from the order, claiming that this was necessitated by Fortune having the wrong signs in her aura. Fortune later claimed that she subsequently came under psychic attack from Mathers, during which she was confronted and assaulted by both real and etheric cats.

===The Theosophical Society and the Community of the Inner Light: 1927–30 ===

Later claiming that she was acting under instruction from the Ascended Masters, Fortune and Loveday joined the Christian Mystic Lodge of the Theosophical Society, which was run by Daisy M. Grove. Fortune soon became its president, and under her leadership the group&#x27;s membership expanded and the readership of its published &quot;Transactions&quot; also grew. Throughout this period, she foregrounded the need for a Christian perspective within the Theosophical movement, emphasising the centrality and importance of the &#x27;Master Jesus&#x27; in her various articles. She publicly criticised another Theosophical group, the Liberal Catholic Church founded by J. I. Wedgwood and Charles Webster Leadbeater, alleging that it was not concerned with the Master Jesus and was instead preoccupied with the Master Maitreya. One of the prominent figures in the Church, Bishop Piggott, accused her of attributing false claims to him in &quot;The Occult Review&quot;.

Amid these arguments with other sectors of the Theosophical movement, she resigned from the Theosophical Society in October. Her Christian Mystic Lodge abandoned its affiliation with the Society and renamed itself the Community of the Inner Light. Within this Community was established a group called the Guild of the Master Jesus, which held regular church services on Sundays at their Queensborough Terrace base from 1928 until 1939; in 1936 this group renamed itself the Church of the Graal. Fortune directed many seekers who lacked the self-discipline for ceremonial magical activity to the Guild, whose members were known by one senior Community member as the &quot;teeny-weenies&quot;.

When Jiddu Krishnamurti abandoned Theosophy, causing problems for the Theosophical movement, Fortune endorsed the &#x27;Back to Blavatsky&#x27; faction, attacking Leadbeater in print by accusing him of being a practitioner of black magic. She then involved herself with Bomanji Wadia and his United Lodge of Theosophists, through which she claimed to have contacted the Himalayan Masters. She nevertheless was cautious about these Himalayan adepts, relating that although she felt that they were &quot;not evil&quot;, she thought them &quot;alien and unsympathetic&quot; and &quot;hostile to my race&quot;. Unhappy with the concept of promoting Indian religious beliefs in Britain, she left the group. Subsequently, she claimed that Wadia had begun to psychically attack her.

In April 1927, Fortune married Tom Penry Evans—a Welsh medical doctor from a working-class background—at Paddington Registry Office, before the couple embarked on a honeymoon in Glastonbury. Their marriage was initially happy, although Evans may have been perturbed at having to immerse himself in occultism to a greater extent than he had planned. He was present throughout a program of trance mediumship in which Fortune claimed to be channelling the messages of a &quot;Master of Medicine&quot;. Beginning in August 1927, the channelled messages focused around issues of alternative medicine and diagnostics and were later assembled as &quot;The Principles of Esoteric Medicine&quot;, which was privately circulated among Fortune&#x27;s senior students. Some members of Fortune&#x27;s group believed that the &quot;Master of Medicine&quot; was actually Paracelsus, although a later channelled message claimed that this Master&#x27;s earthly identity had been Ignaz Semmelweis.

In 1927 Fortune published her first occult novel, &quot;The Demon Lover&quot;, which received a brief but positive review in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;.
The following year she published &quot;The Problem of Purity&quot;, her final book to appear under the name of &quot;Violet Firth&quot;. In 1928 she published a textbook on her esoteric beliefs, &quot;The Esoteric Orders and their Work&quot;, which she followed with a companion work in 1930, &quot;The Training and Work of an Initiate&quot;.
In 1930 this was followed by &quot;Psychic Self-Defense&quot;, which contained many autobiographical elements and which was probably her most commercially popular book. According to the historian Claire Fanger, this book was &quot;part anecdotal evidence, part do-it-yourself exorcism manual, part autobiography, and some part no doubt fiction.&quot;

Fortune and her group focused on &#x27;Outer Court&#x27; work, which entailed engaging in publicity to boost membership. They held regular lectures at their Bayswater premises, with Fortune herself lecturing there twice a week for much of 1928. At their Glastonbury property, which they called the Chalice Orchard, they established a guest house and a social centre which was open in the summer, and where lectures were also carried out. In October 1927 they began production of a magazine, &quot;The Inner Light&quot;, with the initial print-run of 500 selling out in a fortnight. The magazine gained a wide readership, with many subscribers located outside of Britain. Within the group they formulated a three degree system, through which the initiate could progress as they gained a better knowledge and understanding of the group, its teachings, and its rituals. Progress through these degrees could be fairly rapid, with the only requirement being that an individual remain in one degree for at least three months before entering the next. Training in these three degrees was referred to as the &#x27;Lesser Mysteries&#x27;, allowing a practitioner to ascend into the &#x27;Greater Mysteries&#x27;. The membership that they attracted was largely female, with 21 women to only 5 men being members in this period. All members, whether male or female, were initially referred to as &quot;Brother&quot;, although this system later gave way to the term &quot;Server Brother&quot;. At Midwinter 1928, they ritually established the Fraternity of the Inner Light—a sector of the group concerned with the &#x27;Lesser Mysteries&#x27; that they could present to their membership—with Fortune, Evans, and Loveday as its principal officers.

===Declining activity: 1930–38===

At the vernal equinox of 1930, Fortune declared that—with the &#x27;Lesser Mysteries&#x27; and three degree system now properly established—she wanted to turn away from public work and focus on personal spiritual development. At the vernal equinox of 1931, Fortune stepped down as leader of the Fraternity, with Loveday being appointed Magus of the Lodge in her place. During the 1930s, Fortune&#x27;s emphasis moved away from mediumship and towards ritual, while at the same time other Fraternity members embraced mediumship in order to channel the messages of the Masters. In late 1931, Fortune began mooting the idea of the construction of a permanent base, or Sanctuary, at the Chalice Orchard, and despite the economic obstacles of the Great Depression was able to raise sufficient funds. The group experienced a growth in the numbers attending its lectures, subscribing to its correspondence course, and using their private library; conversely, their Sunday services were not very popular, with a move from the morning to the evening seeing no effect. One significant individual who joined the Fraternity was Christine Campbell Thomson, who had been Fortune&#x27;s literary agent since 1926. Fortune subsequently aided Thomson in separating from her abusive husband, after which she grew close to another Fraternity member, Colonel C. R. F. Seymour, in 1937. Although Seymour became a senior member of the Fraternity, relations between him and Fortune were strained, and during the Second World War he left London and settled in Liverpool, terminating his involvement with Fortune&#x27;s Bayswater temple.

By 1933, tensions in Fortune&#x27;s marriage were tearing it apart. There were rumours that Evans was having extra-marital affairs with other women, while Fortune confided in female members of the Fraternity that she had married him for magical reasons rather than because she loved him. Evans eventually asked for a divorce in order to marry another woman; Fortune was appalled, but did not contest it. Fortune had begun renting The Belfry, a converted Presbyterian chapel in West Halkin Street, where she then took up residence. It was here, during the latter 1930s, that she produced a number of rituals, among them the Rite of Isis and the Rite of Pan. As these and other aspects of her work testify, during the latter half of the decade Fortune had moved in what Richardson described as &quot;an increasingly pagan orientation&quot;.

Fortune published many articles in &quot;Inner Light&quot; magazine, a number of which were collected together and published in books. In 1930, the first such collection was published as &quot;Mystical Meditations upon the Collects&quot;, in which Fortune emphasised her Christian commitments. In 1931 a number of her &quot;Inner Light&quot; articles on Spiritualism appeared as &quot;Spiritualism in the Light of Occult Science&quot;. In this book Fortune expressed reservations about Spiritualism. She drew a distinction between normal Spiritualist mediums and &#x27;cosmic mediums&#x27; such as herself who contacted the Ascended Masters, also arguing that the spirits of the dead should not be contacted without good reason, a view that generated controversy among the occult milieu. In 1934, she assembled a number of her &quot;Inner Light&quot; articles on Glastonbury as &quot;Avalon of the Heart&quot;, while further &quot;Inner Light&quot; articles were assembled as &quot;Practical Occultism in Daily Life&quot;, a book aimed at a general reader.
A number of Fortune&#x27;s articles from &quot;The Occult Review&quot; were also collected to produce the book &quot;Sane Occultism&quot;.

Over four years, Fortune also published a number of articles in &quot;Inner Light&quot; that discussed the Hermetic Qabalah. These articles were then assembled as the book &quot;The Mystical Qabalah&quot;, which is widely perceived as a milestone in her esoteric career. While lambasting most of Fortune&#x27;s works as &quot;rather vulgar pot-boiling journalism&quot;, the writer Francis X. King characterised &quot;The Mystical Qabalah&quot; as &quot;undoubtedly a classic of the Western Tradition&quot;. The work constituted a theoretical discussion based in the Golden Dawn system of correspondences to the Qabalic Tree of Life which she had obtained through her membership of the Alpha et Omega group. However, it was also rooted in her own personal experiences and visions; while meditating, she believed that she had visited the various Sephiroth of the Qabalic tree.

In 1935 she published her second occult novel, &quot;The Winged Bull&quot;—which was again reviewed in &quot;The Times Literary Review&quot;—and in 1936 her third, &quot;The Goat-Foot God&quot;. In 1938 Fortune wrote a fourth occult novel, &quot;The Sea Priestess&quot;, which was eventually self-published through the Fraternity after being declined by Williams and Norgate, who had published the previous two. Her final novel, &quot;Moon Magic&quot;, was apparently left unfinished prior to the outbreak of the Second World War; a protégé later completed it, claiming to have done so through channeling Blavatsky&#x27;s disembodied spirit, and it was published posthumously.

Fortune corresponded with a number of prominent occultists in this period. One of these was Israel Regardie, whose book &quot;The Tree of Life&quot; was regarded by Fortune as &quot;quite the best book on magic&quot; that she had read. Regardie later publicly criticised her for misrepresenting his works in her reviews of them; she had claimed that his works bolstered her beliefs about the Masters, although Regardie insisted that he was sceptical about the existence of such entities. Fortune also corresponded with Olga Fröbe-Kapteyn, the Dutch esotericist who founded Eranos in Switzerland. She also renewed her interest in Jungian psychology, which was then growing in influence among the esoteric milieu, and was influenced by her reading of Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot;.

===Later life: 1939–46===

The outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 saw some of the Fraternity&#x27;s members enlist in the armed forces, putting a stop to many of the group&#x27;s activities. From October 1939 through to October 1942, Fortune organised group meditations every Sunday with the intent of focusing Fraternity members towards the cause of peace. In February 1940, she undertook a visualisation in which she imagined angelic forces patrolling Britain&#x27;s coast, believing that in doing so she was helping to make these forces a reality. She urged Fraternity members to repeat a mantra every time the German Luftwaffe began bombing Britain, through which she hoped to call upon &quot;Invisible Helpers&quot; from the &quot;Inner Planes&quot; to aid the people affected. The Fraternity&#x27;s London headquarters were damaged during the Blitz, although roofing repairs were made and the group were able to move back into the building after a week. In August 1940, the group had to suspend publication of &quot;Inner Light&quot; as a result of paper shortages in Britain.

After the United States entered the conflict in December 1941, Fortune began assembling plans for the post-war period, believing it would mark the dawning of the Age of Aquarius. In the spring of 1942 the Fraternity recommenced the Guild&#x27;s Sunday services, and in March 1943 Fortune announced a new study course for aspiring members. As part of her plans for the post-war period, Fortune began mooting the idea of bringing together all of Europe&#x27;s occultists to pool their knowledge. She also began discussing the possibility of uniting occult groups with the Spiritualist movement, writing articles that were more favourable towards Spiritualist mediums than she had previously been and meeting with Charles Richard Cammell, the editor of &quot;Light&quot;—the magazine of the College of Psychic Studies—who then published a favourable article about her. By at least 1942, Fortune corresponded with the prominent occultist and ceremonial magician Aleister Crowley, praising him as &quot;a genuine adept&quot; despite the many differences between their respective occult philosophies. She later visited him at his home in Hastings, with Crowley&#x27;s assistant Kenneth Grant noting that the pair got along well.

In August 1940, Fortune embarked on a further project of trance mediumship, this time with her Alpha et Omega mentor, Curtis-Webb (now renamed Maiya Tranchall-Hayes), in the hope of contacting the same Masters who they believed had aided the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. In doing so, they believed that they were channelling messages from an entity known as &quot;the Shemesh of the Aquarian Age&quot;. These communications were received between April 1941 and February 1942, and together became known as &quot;the Arthurian Formula&quot;; they provided the basis of much of the Fraternity&#x27;s &#x27;Greater Mystery&#x27; work following the war. The claims produced in these channelled meditations presented the Arthurian myths as racial memories that had been passed down from Atlantis, having been brought to Britain by Atlantean settlers after the cataclysm that destroyed their island. It also set forward a threefold system of training: that of Arthur and his Round Table Fellowship, that of Merlin and the Faery Woman, and that of Guinevere and the Forces of Love.

In late 1945, Fortune fell ill, and was unable to give her scheduled address to the Fraternity on that year&#x27;s winter solstice.
She died at Middlesex Hospital of leukaemia in January 1946, at the age of 55. Her body was transferred to Glastonbury, where it was buried in a funeral overseen by the Reverend L. S. Lewis, vicar of St. John&#x27;s Church. When Loveday died shortly after, he was buried close to her.
She bequeathed most of her money to her Society. During Fortune&#x27;s lifetime, some of the Fraternity members had expressed concerns with regard to the organisation becoming a personality cult revolving around her, and so following her death they did not encourage an interest in her biography. Members of the society have alleged that her successor destroyed most of her diaries, correspondences, and photographs. However, a number of her books would be published posthumously, among them &quot;The Cosmic Doctrine&quot;, which appeared in 1949, and her novel &quot;Moon Magic&quot;, published in 1956.

==Novels==
Fortune completed seven novels during her lifetime. Four were occult and fantasy themed: &quot;The Demon Lover&quot;, &quot;The Winged Bull&quot;, &quot;The Goat-Foot God&quot;, and &quot;The Sea Priestess&quot;. The literary scholar Susan Johnson Graf categorises these alongside the work of H. Rider Haggard, Algernon Blackwood, Charles Williams, and Arthur Machen. The other three were romantic thrillers published under the pseudonym of &quot;V. M. Steele&quot;: &quot;The Scarred Wrists&quot;, &quot;Hunters of Humans&quot;, and &quot;Beloved of Ishmael&quot;. Writing thrillers was one of few activities Fortune took part in unconnected to her magical work, and was something she did not publicise. Knight believed these three novels testified to the idea that &quot;she must really have loved writing for writing&#x27;s sake&quot;. An eighth novel, &quot;Moon Magic&quot;, was left unfinished but completed by her protégé and published posthumously.

Fortune saw her occult novels as an important part of her Fraternity work, initiating readers into the realms of occultism by speaking to their subconscious, even when their conscious mind rejects occult teachings. She thus perceived them as a means of disseminating her teachings to a wider audience. Each was related to one of the Sephirah on the Qabalic Tree of Life: &quot;The Winged Bull&quot; was associated with Tiphareth, &quot;The Goat-Foot God&quot; with Malkuth, and &quot;The Sea Priestess&quot; with Yesod.

Fortune&#x27;s first novel was &quot;The Demon Lover&quot;, which tells the story of Veronica Mainwaring, a young virgin woman who becomes the secretary to a malevolent magician, Justin Lucas, who seeks to exploit her latent mediumistic powers for his own purposes. Although she falls in love with him, she eventually escapes his entrapments through her devotion to Christianity. Her next work, &quot;The Winged Bull&quot;, focuses on Ursula Brangwyn, who had been harmed by her involvement in an unscrupulous occult group but meets with Ted Murchison, whom she subsequently marries. The characters in &quot;The Winged Bull&quot; are based upon real people in Fortune&#x27;s life; Murchison is based on her husband, for example, and she modeled Brangwyn after herself. The character of Hugo Astley has been interpreted as a &quot;barely veiled fictional portrait&quot; of Aleister Crowley. Richardson felt that &quot;The Winged Bull&quot; was &quot;in many ways the worst of her books&quot;. The scholar Andrew Radford suggested that the novel reflected a &quot;zeal in promoting a socially responsible occultism rooted in orthodox gender roles&quot; and demonstrated her growing concern that occultism was increasingly being associated with what she regarded as an immoral cosmopolitan elite synonymous with Crowley and his activities.

&quot;The Goat-Foot God&quot; revolves around a wealthy widower, Hugh Patson, who teams up with an esoteric bookseller to seek out the ancient Greek god Pan. They achieve this with the aid of a poverty-stricken artist, Mona Wilton, who becomes close to Patson as the novel progresses. Richardson described &quot;The Goat-Foot God&quot; as &quot;a masterpiece ... the finest occult novel ever written&quot;. &quot;The Sea Priestess&quot; is about Wilfred Maxwell, a man living with his mother and sister who learns to commune with the Moon after an asthma attack. He meets with Le Fay Morgan, a spiritual adept, and together they enter an obsessive (on Wilfred&#x27;s part) but platonic relationship while establishing a temple to the sea gods.

Fortune&#x27;s novels all follow the same basic theme: a heroine – a priestess and initiatrix who is magically experienced and assertive – who meets a man and saves him from himself. In her later novels this entails the duos reconstructing or revitalising a ritual space and working magical rituals to channel cosmic forces and bring them into balance.

In her discussion of Fortune&#x27;s work, Sonja Sadovsky stated that the &quot;unique element&quot; of Fortune&#x27;s fiction was &quot;the recurring plotline of esoteric romance told from the priestess&#x27;s viewpoint&quot;, suggesting that her female characters provided a template from which female readers could build upon in their own spiritual practice. Sadovsky further suggested that there were two types of priestess who appeared in Fortune&#x27;s novels, the &quot;Earth Mother&quot; and the &quot;Moon Mistress&quot;. According to Sadovsky, the &quot;Earth Mother&quot; was represented by the character of Mona Wilkins in &quot;The Goat-Foot God&quot; and that of Molly Coke in &quot;The Sea Priestess&quot;. She suggested that these characters derived their power from the masculine/feminine polarity and the creative power of sex, and that they also required a male priest in order to initiate them into their spiritual mysteries and to reach their full potential. The second type of priestess, the &quot;Moon Mistress&quot;, appeared as Vivien/Lilith le Fay Morgan in &quot;The Sea Priestess&quot; and then becomes more dominant in &quot;Moon Magic&quot;. According to Sadovsky, this is a celibate figure who concentrates her creative powers on training priestesses and dealing with occult matters.

==Belief and teachings==

===Religion and race===

Fortune identified her beliefs as being part of what she termed &quot;the Western Mystery Tradition&quot;. 
She adhered to a form of esoteric Christianity, and has been described as a Christian Qabalist, and as &quot;a devout mystical Christian&quot;, albeit &quot;a very unorthodox one&quot;. She expressed the opinion that &quot;in any school of Western mysticism the author and finisher of our faith must be Christ Jesus, the Great Initiator of the West&quot;, and treated &quot;the Master Jesus&quot; as her personal spiritual guide. She believed that the teachings passed down from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn served the purpose of recovering &quot;sacred mysteries&quot; or &quot;gnosis&quot; that had been overlooked by mainstream Christianity. Accordingly, she had no allegiance to any established Christian churches and was often critical of mainstream clergy. Moreover, she rejected a number of traditional Christian doctrines, such as that surrounding Heaven and Hell.

However she is also rightly described as a student of Hermetic Qabalah. Indeed Knight recognises that her work was Hermetic in nature, &quot;Whether she realised it or not, for this was before Frances Yates had made the roots of the Hermetic tradition more accessible...&quot;
There is no evidence that Fortune considered herself to be a Pagan. However, by the late 1930s, Fortune had developed some interest in the religion of ancient Egypt, but treated it as a preparation for the higher truth of Christianity. In the 1930s her attitude began to change as she became more favourable to pre-Christian religion, likely under the influence of her husband, Seymour, and D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;The Rainbow&quot;, of which she was a fan. By &quot;The Winged Bull&quot;, she was declaring that pre-Christian gods were just as valid as facets of the divine as the Christian God, and around this time she began to adopt an increasingly critical attitude to Christianity, stating that it had been greatly degraded since its origins and distorted by &quot;those two crusty old bachelors&quot;, Paul the Apostle and Augustine of Hippo. In her next novel, &quot;The Goat-Foot God&quot;, Fortune had fully embraced the idea of a modern Paganism reviving the belief systems of pre-Christian Europe, referring to this as &quot;Vitamin P&quot; and declaring that it was needed to heal the modern world. Around this time she began promoting the claim that &quot;All the gods are one god, and all the goddesses are one goddess&quot;. However, during the Second World War her writings became more pronouncedly Christian once again.

Fortune believed in the existence of an underlying commonality between the teachings of Western esoteric orders and Asian religious traditions. Nevertheless, she believed that particular spiritual traditions were allotted to specific racial groups, stating that &quot;the Great White Lodge gives to each race the religion suited to its needs&quot;. Writing in &quot;The Occult Review&quot;, Fortune stated: &quot;Do not let it be forgotten that our traditions are racial. What that great initiate Rudolf Steiner did for the German-speaking races someone must do for those who use a Latin-root language and the Anglo-Saxon tongue.&quot;
She did not agree with allowing spiritual and magical techniques to transmit between different cultures, believing that to do so caused damage; she for instance cautioned against allowing Western esoteric teachings to be practised in India because &quot;the Hindu dies readily from shock&quot;. Equally she strongly opposed the adoption of Asian religious techniques into Western esotericism, distancing herself from occultists who did so. In her words, she must &quot;recommend to the white races the traditional Western system, which is admirably adapted to their psychic constitution&quot;. She nevertheless perceived value in Westerners studying Asian disciplines like Yoga on a theoretical level, so long as they eschewed any attempt to put these teachings into practice.
The religious studies scholar Gordan Djurdjevic highlighted that 21st century readers would likely deem there to be &quot;a strong cultural essentialism and even racial prejudice in her writings&quot;, but that ideas regarding the close relationship between &quot;culture, race, and religion&quot; were &quot;a part of everyday discourse&quot; in Britain during her lifetime.

===Magic===

Fortune was a ceremonial magician. The magical principles on which her Fraternity was based were adopted from the late nineteenth century Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, with other influences coming from Theosophy and Christian Science. The magical ceremonies performed by Fortune&#x27;s Fraternity were placed into two categories: initiations, in which the candidate was introduced to magical forces, and evocation, in which these forces were manipulated for a given purpose.

The Fraternity&#x27;s rituals at their Bayswater temple were carried out under a dim light, with Fortune claiming that bright light disperses etheric forces. An altar was placed in the centre of a room, with the colours of the altar-cloth and the symbols on the altar varying according to the ceremony being performed. A light was placed on the altar while incense, usually frankincense, was burned. The senior officers sat in a row along the eastern end of the room, while officers—who were believed to be channels for cosmic forces—were positioned at various positions on the floor. The lodge was opened by walking around the room in a circle chanting, with the intent of building a psychic force up as a wall. Next, the cosmic entities would be invoked, with the members believing that these entities would manifest in astral form and interact with the chosen officers.

Fortune was particularly concerned with the issue of sex. In her early works she displayed a prudish attitude regarding sexuality, warning her readers about the perceived perils of masturbation, extra-marital sex, same-sex sexual activity, abortion, and free love. The only form of sexual expression that she considered appropriate was that between a heterosexual married couple, and she promoted a form of &#x27;psychic masturbation&#x27; to quell any sexual urges that a celibate individual may have. According to Richardson, she was &quot;a prude, at least by today&#x27;s standards&quot;. In her later works she exhibited a more positive attitude toward sexuality, describing the sexual union between a man and woman as the most powerful expression of a &quot;life-force&quot; which flows throughout the universe. She believed that this erotic attraction between men and women could be harnessed for use in magic. She urged her followers to be naked under their robes when carrying out magical rituals, for this would increase the creative sexual tension between the men and women present. Although sex features in her novels, it is never described in graphic detail. Nevertheless, her later occult novels entail depictions of heterosexual sex outside of marriage, suggesting that by this point Fortune no longer believed that sex must be restrained to wedlock. The scholar Andrew Radford noted that Fortune&#x27;s &quot;reactionary and highly heteronormative&quot; view of &quot;sacralised sexuality&quot; should be seen as part of a wider tradition among esoteric currents, going back to the ideas of Emanuel Swedenborg and Andrew Jackson Davis and also being found in the work of occultists like Paschal Beverly Randolph and Ida Craddock.

Fortune was among those who popularised the idea of a division between the left-hand path and right-hand path which had been introduced to Western esotericism by the Theosophist Helena Blavatsky. In doing so Fortune connected her disparaging views on what she considered to be the left hand path to the moral panic surrounding homosexuality in British society. Her works contained commentaries in which she condemned the &quot;homosexual techniques&quot; of malevolent male magicians, and she claimed that the acceptance of homosexuality was the cause of the downfall of the ancient Greek and Roman civilisations. The manner in which she sought to demonise the left hand path has been compared to that found in the work of English novelist Dennis Wheatley.

==Personality and personal life==

The historian Claire Fanger noted that Fortune exhibited a &quot;dynamic personality and confident leadership&quot;. Janine Chapman, an esotericist who researched Fortune&#x27;s life, stated that &quot;in her prime&quot;, Fortune was &quot;a strong, magnetic personality&quot; with &quot;an active, intellectually curious mind&quot; who was also &quot;physically imposing&quot;. Chapman noted that while studying at horticultural college, Fortune had earned a reputation for having a &quot;keen sense of humor&quot;, being particularly fond of practical jokes. Richardson characterised Fortune as being &quot;honest, and often ruthless with her honesty&quot;, adding that she was &quot;an essentially good woman who had strands of darkness within&quot;. Chapman noted that she &quot;set an example of super-achievement, self-sacrifice, and personal integrity&quot; and that &quot;sexually, she was modest, faithful, and chaste&quot;. In her later years, she earned a nickname among her friends in the Fraternity; &quot;The Fluff&quot;.

Chapman characterised Fortune&#x27;s marriage as &quot;rocky&quot;, and the marriage produced no children. In later life, there were unsubstantiated rumours that Fortune had sexual relationships with both men and women, and in particular that she had a relationship with Tranchall-Hayes.

Fortune did not involve herself or her group in any explicitly political movement or party. The historian Ronald Hutton noted that in her political and social views, Fortune was likely a High Tory, with Richardson noting that politically, she was &quot;somewhat aligned&quot; to the ideas of the Conservative politician Winston Churchill. Graf noted that although Fortune was not involved in the feminist movement and did not associate with feminists, she &quot;thought herself every bit as powerful, capable, independent, and discerning as any man, and she worked to spiritually empower women.&quot; When staying at Queensborough, Fortune kept to a vegetarian diet.

==Reception and legacy==

According to Richardson, Fortune fell into &quot;relative obscurity&quot; after her death, having been overshadowed by her more famous contemporary, Aleister Crowley. The historian of esotericism Dave Evans agreed, stating that Fortune had been &quot;somewhat less&quot; influential than Crowley.
Hutton nevertheless considered her to be the &quot;foremost female figure&quot; of early 20th century British occultism, while historian Alex Owen referred to her as &quot;one of the most significant clairvoyants and occultists of the postwar period&quot;. Similarly, Knight termed her &quot;one of the leading occultists of her generation&quot;, and the anthropologist Tanya Luhrmann referred to her as &quot;one of the most influential twentieth-century magicians&quot;. Another esotericism scholar, Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, said Fortune was an &quot;important heir of the Golden Dawn, and she had a significant influence on modern Western esotericism&quot;. Religious studies scholar Stephen Sutcliffe described her as having &quot;played a key role in the cult of Glastonbury in the interwar years&quot;, while anthropologist Susan Greenwood thought Fortune&#x27;s emphasis on a masculine/feminine polarity as the basis for magical working was a significant influence on both later ceremonial magic and Wicca.

Fortune&#x27;s Fraternity survived her, and was renamed the Society of the Inner Light in 1946; the change was a legal refinement to help the group achieve charitable status. It continues to operate into the early 21st century. The Society sold the Chalice Orchard, which was eventually purchased by Geoffrey Ashe, and in 1959 sold their Bayswater headquarters after the socio-economic decline of the area, instead establishing a base in North London. While retaining its basis in Fortune&#x27;s original teachings, the Society has changed its emphasis according to who has led it over the years. At various points it has been heavily influenced by Alice Bailey&#x27;s ideas about the Ascended Masters, the ideas of Subud, and the use of Scientology&#x27;s E-meters. In 1961, the Society adopted a new approach which further emphasised and foregrounded its Christian identity. This generated controversy in the group, with Gareth Knight leaving to form his own lodge based on Fortune&#x27;s teachings, known as the Gareth Knight Group. In 1973 one of Fortune&#x27;s students, W. E. Butler, likewise split with the Fraternity to found his own group in Jersey, the Servants of the Light, which would later be taken over by Dolores Ashcroft-Nowicki and remains one of the world&#x27;s largest esoteric organizations in the early 21st century maintaining about 1000 active students. In 1975, another member of the Society, Alan Adams, departed to start the London Group, which was initially based in outer London but later moved to the East Midlands.

By the late 1990s the Society&#x27;s membership had dropped to a few dozen, and under the control of a new warden it invited Knight to return to the group in order to help promote it. Knight agreed, leaving his own lodge to publish two works by Fortune based on her material in the Society&#x27;s archive, and authoring a biography of her. The 1990s saw a number of pioneering biographical studies of Fortune, including Alan Richardson&#x27;s in 1991 and Janine Chapman&#x27;s in 1993. Richardson&#x27;s book relied heavily on the recollections of Christine Hartley, while the publication of Fielding and Carr was based upon the authors&#x27; interactions with older members of the Society. However, in 2007 Graf noted that Fortune had yet to receive much scholarly attention.

In the early 21st century, Evans noted that Fortune&#x27;s work was &quot;still influential in some magical quarters&quot;, highlighting that in his experience she was one of only three female ceremonial magicians—alongside Leah Hirsig and Jaq Hawkins—that modern esotericists could readily name.

===Fortune&#x27;s literary influence on modern Paganism===

The religious studies scholar Hugh Urban noted that Fortune was &quot;one of the key links&quot; between early twentieth-century ceremonial magic and the developing Pagan religion of Wicca. Similarly, the Wiccan high priestess Vivianne Crowley characterised Fortune as a &quot;proto-Pagan&quot;. The scholar and esotericist Nevill Drury stated that Fortune &quot;in many ways anticipated feminist ideas in contemporary Wicca&quot;, particularly through her belief that all goddesses were a manifestation of a single Great Goddess. Graf agreed, adding that Fortune&#x27;s works found &quot;resonance&quot; in the work of the later feminist Wiccan Starhawk, and in particular in the latter&#x27;s 1979 book, &quot;The Spiral Dance&quot;.

In researching ceremonial magic orders and other esoteric groups active in the London area during the 1980s, Luhrmann found that within them, Fortune&#x27;s novels were treated as &quot;fictionalized ideals&quot; and that they were recommended to newcomers as the best way to understand magic. The Pagan studies scholar Joanne Pearson added that Fortune&#x27;s books, and in particular the novels &quot;The Sea Priestess&quot; and &quot;Moon Magic&quot;, were owned by many Wiccans and other Pagans. The religious studies scholar Graham Harvey compared &quot;The Sea Priestess&quot; to the Wiccan Gerald Gardner&#x27;s 1949 novel &quot;High Magic&#x27;s Aid&quot;, stating that while neither were &quot;great literature&quot;, they &quot;evoke Paganism better than later more didactic works&quot;.

Fortune&#x27;s priestesses were an influence on the characters of Marion Zimmer Bradley&#x27;s &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;, and her ideas were adopted as the basis for the Aquarian Order of the Restoration, a ceremonial magic group led by Bradley. Her works also influenced Bradley&#x27;s collaborator and fellow Order member Diana Paxson. As of 2007, Fortune&#x27;s latter three novels remained in print and had a wide readership. Evans nevertheless believed that her writings were &quot;stuck in their era&quot; in many places; as evidence, he highlighted passages in which Fortune warns her readers that their Indian servants may steal their body waste products for use in the worship of the Hindu goddess Kali.

<doc id="207223" wikidata="Q21653344" url="?curid=207223" title="Carol (music)">
<text>A carol is a festive song, generally religious but not necessarily connected with Christian church worship, and sometimes accompanied by a dance. A caroller (or caroler) is someone who sings carols, and is said to be carolling (or caroling).

Today the carol is represented almost exclusively by the Advent carol, the Christmas carol, and to a lesser extent by the Easter carol; however, despite their present association with religion, this has not always been the case.

==History==

The word &quot;carol&quot; is derived from the Old French word &quot;carole&quot;, a circle dance accompanied by singers (in turn derived from the Latin &quot;choraula&quot;). Carols were very popular as dance songs from the 1150s to the 1350s, after which their use expanded as processional songs sung during festivals, while others were written to accompany religious mystery plays (such as the &quot;Coventry Carol&quot;, written before 1534).

Sacred music was traditionally sung in Latin by clergy or appointed cantors of the Catholic church. Following the Protestant Reformation, reformers aimed to bring music &quot;back to the people&quot;. To enable the common person to sing church music, great efforts were made to translate musical texts from Latin into the native languages that people spoke. Martin Luther, the father of Lutheran Christianity, encouraged congregational singing during the Mass, in addition to spreading the practice of caroling outside the liturgy. Composers such as William Byrd composed motet-like works for Christmas that they termed carols; and folk-carols continued to be sung in rural areas. Nonetheless, some famous carols were written in this period, and they were more strongly revived from the nineteenth century and began to be written and adapted by eminent composers.

==Modern carols==

In modern times, songs that may once have been regarded as carols are now no longer classified as such (especially Christmas songs), even those that retain the traditional attributes of a carol – celebrating a seasonal topic, alternating verses and chorus, and danceable music.

Some writers of carols, such as George Ratcliffe Woodward who wrote &quot;Ding Dong Merrily on High&quot; and William Morris who wrote &quot;Masters in This Hall&quot;, reverted to a quasi-mediaeval style; this became a feature of the early twentieth-century revival in Christmas Carols.

Some composers have written extended works based on carols. Examples include Benjamin Britten (&quot;A Ceremony of Carols&quot;), Ralph Vaughan Williams (&quot;Fantasia on Christmas Carols&quot;) and Victor Hely-Hutchinson (&quot;Carol Symphony&quot;).

<text>USS &quot;Hornet&quot; (CV-8), the seventh U.S. Navy vessel of that name, was a of the United States Navy.

During World War II in the Pacific Theater, she launched the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo and participated in the Battle of Midway and the Buin-Faisi-Tonolai raid. In the Solomon Islands campaign, she was involved in the capture and defense of Guadalcanal and the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, where she was irreparably damaged by enemy torpedo and dive bombers. Faced with an approaching Japanese surface force, &quot;Hornet&quot; was abandoned and later torpedoed and sunk by approaching Japanese destroyers. &quot;Hornet&quot; was in service for one year and six days, and was the last U.S. fleet carrier ever sunk by enemy fire. For these actions, she was awarded four service stars and a citation for the Doolittle Raid in 1942, and her Torpedo Squadron 8 received a Presidential Unit Citation for extraordinary heroism for its performance at the Battle of Midway.

In January 2019, the wreckage of the vessel was located near the Solomon Islands.

== Construction and commissioning ==

Because of the limit on aggregate aircraft carrier tonnage included in the Washington Naval Treaty and subsequent London treaties, the United States had intended to build two &quot;Yorktown-&quot;class aircraft carriers and use the remaining allocated tonnage for a smaller, revised version of the same design, which eventually became . With war looming in Europe and the repudiation of the naval limitation treaties by Japan and Italy, the Navy&#x27;s General Board decided to lay down a third carrier of the &quot;Yorktown&quot; design immediately - followed by the first carrier of the succeeding &quot;Essex&quot; class (CV-9). When the design was finalized, authorization from Congress came in the Naval Expansion Act of 1938.

&quot;Hornet&quot; had a length of at the waterline and overall. She had a beam of at the waterline, overall, with a draft of as designed and at full load. She displaced at standard load and at full load. She was designed for a ship&#x27;s crew consisting of 86 officers and 1280 men and an air complement consisting of 141 officers and 710 men.

She was powered by nine Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers providing steam at and to four Parsons Marine geared steam turbines each driving its own propeller. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , giving her a range of at a speed of . She was designed to carry of fuel oil and of Avgas. Her designed speed was . During sea trials, she produced and reached .

&quot;Hornet&quot; was equipped with 8 /38 caliber dual-purpose guns and 16 /75 caliber anti-aircraft guns in quad mounts (four guns operating together). Originally, she had 24 M2 Browning machine guns, but these were replaced in January 1942 with 30 20-mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannon. An additional quad mount was later added at her bow and two more 20 mm anti-aircraft guns were added for a total of 32 mounts. In addition, her athwartships hangar-deck aircraft catapult was removed. In June 1942, following the battle of Midway, &quot;Hornet&quot; had a new CXAM radar installed atop her tripod mast, and her SC radar was relocated to her mainmast. Unlike her sisters, &quot;Hornet&quot;″s tripod mast and its signal bridge were not enclosed when the CXAM was installed, making her unique among the three ships.

&quot;Hornet&quot; had an armor belt that was thick on a backing of special treatment steel (STS). The flight and hangar decks were unarmored though the protective deck was STS. Bulkheads had armor, while the conning tower had splinter protection only, in contrast with her sister&#x27;s armor on the sides with on top. The steering gear had protection on the sides with splinter protection on the deck.

Her flight deck was and her hangar deck was and high. She had three aircraft elevators each with a lifting capacity of . She had two flight-deck and one hangar-deck hydraulic catapults equipped with the Mark IV Mod 3A arresting gear with a capability of and . She was designed to host a Carrier Air Group of 18 fighters, 18 bombers, 37 scout planes, 18 torpedo bombers, and six utility aircraft.

&quot;Hornet&quot; was laid down on 25 September 1939 by Newport News Shipbuilding of Newport News, Virginia, and was launched on 14 December 1940, sponsored by Annie Reid Knox, wife of Secretary of the Navy Frank M. Knox. She was commissioned at Naval Station Norfolk on 20 October 1941, with Captain Marc A. Mitscher in command.

== Service history ==

Before the attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Hornet&quot; trained out of Norfolk. A hint of a future mission occurred on 2 February 1942 when &quot;Hornet&quot; departed Norfolk with two Army Air Forces B-25 Mitchell medium bombers on deck. Once at sea, the planes were launched to the surprise and amazement of &quot;Hornet&quot;″s crew. Her men were unaware of the meaning of this experiment. &quot;Hornet&quot; returned to Norfolk, prepared to leave for combat, and sailed for the West Coast on 4 March via the Panama Canal.

=== Doolittle Raid, April 1942 ===
&quot;Hornet&quot; arrived at Naval Air Station Alameda, California, on 20 March 1942 with her own planes on the hangar deck. By midafternoon on 1 April, she loaded 16 B-25s on the flight deck, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel James H. Doolittle, 70 United States Army Air Corps officers and 64 enlisted men reported aboard. In company of her escort, &quot;Hornet&quot; departed Alameda on 2 April under sealed orders. That afternoon, Captain Mitscher informed his men of their mission: a bombing raid on Japan.

Eleven days later, &quot;Hornet&quot; joined the aircraft carrier at Midway, and Task Force 16 turned toward Japan. With &quot;Enterprise&quot; providing combat air patrol cover, &quot;Hornet&quot; was to steam deep into enemy waters. Originally, the task force intended to proceed to within of the Japanese coast, but on the morning of 18 April, a Japanese patrol boat, No. 23 &quot;Nitto Maru&quot;, sighted the American task force. sank the patrol boat. Amid concerns that the Japanese had been made aware of their presence, Doolittle and his raiders launched prematurely from out, instead of the planned . Because of this decision, none of the 16 planes made it to their designated landing strips in China. After the war, Tokyo was found to have received the &quot;Nitto Maru&quot;&#x27;s message in a garbled form and the Japanese ship was sunk before it could get a clear message through to the Japanese mainland.

As &quot;Hornet&quot; came about and prepared to launch the bombers, which had been readied for take-off the previous day, a gale of more than churned the sea with crests. Heavy swells, which caused the ship to pitch violently, shipped sea and spray over the bow, wetted the flight deck, and drenched the deck crews. The lead plane, commanded by Colonel Doolittle, had only of flight deck, while the last B-25 hung its twin rudders far out over the fantail. Doolittle, timing himself against the rise and fall of the ship&#x27;s bow, lumbered down the flight deck, circled &quot;Hornet&quot; after take-off, and set course for Japan. By 09:20, all 16 were airborne, heading for the first American air strike against the Japanese home islands.

&quot;Hornet&quot; brought her own planes on deck as Task Force 16 steamed at full speed for Pearl Harbor. Intercepted broadcasts, both in Japanese and English, confirmed at 14:46 the success of the raids. Exactly one week to the hour after launching the B-25s, &quot;Hornet&quot; sailed into Pearl Harbor. That the Tokyo raid was the &quot;Hornet&quot;″s mission was kept an official secret for a year. Until then, President Roosevelt referred to the ship from which the bombers were launched only as &quot;Shangri-La.&quot; Two years later, the Navy gave this name to an aircraft carrier.

&quot;Hornet&quot; steamed from Pearl Harbor to aid and on 30 April at the Battle of the Coral Sea, though the battle ended before she arrived. On 4 May, Task Force 16 crossed the equator; the first time ever for &quot;Hornet&quot;. &quot;Hornet,&quot; alongside &quot;Enterprise&quot;, executed a feint towards Nauru and Banaba (Ocean) islands, which caused the Japanese to cancel their operation to seize the two islands. She returned to Hawaii on 26 May, and sailed again two days later to help repulse an expected Japanese assault on Midway.

=== Battle of Midway, June 1942 ===

On 28 May 1942, &quot;Hornet&quot; and Task Force 16 steamed out of Pearl Harbor heading for Point &quot;Luck&quot;, an arbitrary spot in the ocean roughly northeast of Midway, where they would be in a flank position to ambush Japan&#x27;s mobile strike force of four frontline aircraft carriers, the &quot;Kidō Butai&quot;. Japanese carrier-based planes were reported headed for Midway in the early morning of 4 June. &quot;Hornet&quot;, &quot;Yorktown&quot;, and &quot;Enterprise&quot; launched aircraft, just as the Japanese carriers struck their planes below to prepare for a second attack on Midway. &quot;Hornet&quot;″s dive bombers followed an incorrect heading and did not find the enemy fleet. Several bombers and all of the escorting fighters were forced to ditch when they ran out of fuel attempting to return to the ship. 15 torpedo bombers of Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8) found the Japanese ships and attacked. They were met by overwhelming fighter opposition about out, and with no escorts to protect them, they were shot down. Ensign George H. Gay, USNR, was the only survivor of 30 men.

Further attacks from &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s and &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s torpedo bombers proved equally disastrous, but succeeded in forcing the Japanese carriers to keep their decks clear for combat air patrol operations, rather than launching a counter-attack against the Americans. Japanese fighters were shooting down the last of the torpedo bombers over when dive bombers of &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot; attacked, causing enormous fires aboard the three other Japanese carriers, ultimately leading to their loss. &quot;Hiryū&quot; was hit late in the afternoon of 4 June by a strike from &quot;Enterprise&quot; and sank early the next morning. &quot;Hornet&quot;″s aircraft, launching late due to the necessity of recovering &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s scout planes and faulty communications, attacked a battleship and other escorts, but failed to score hits. &quot;Yorktown&quot; was lost to combined aerial and submarine attack.

&quot;Hornet&quot;″s aircraft attacked the fleeing Japanese fleet on 6 June and assisted in sinking the heavy cruiser , damaging a destroyer, and leaving the heavy cruiser heavily damaged and on fire. The attack by &quot;Hornet&quot; on the &quot;Mogami&quot; ended one of the great decisive battles of naval history. Midway Atoll was saved as an important base for American operations into the Western Pacific Ocean. Of greatest importance was the crippling of the Japanese carrier strength, a severe blow from which the Imperial Japanese Navy never fully recovered. The four large carriers took with them to the bottom about 250 naval aircraft and a high percentage of the most highly trained and experienced Japanese aircraft maintenance personnel. The victory at Midway was a decisive turning point in the War in the Pacific.

On 16 June 1942, Captain Charles P. Mason became commanding officer of &quot;Hornet&quot; upon her return to Pearl Harbor. &quot;Hornet&quot; spent the next six weeks replenishing her stores, having minor repairs performed, and most importantly, having additional light antiaircraft guns and the new RCA CXAM air-search radar fitted. She did not sail in late July with the forces sent to recapture Guadalcanal, but instead remained at Pearl Harbor in case she was needed elsewhere.

=== Solomon Islands campaign, August–October, 1942 ===

&quot;Hornet&quot; steamed out of harbor on 17 August 1942 to guard sea approaches to the bitterly contested Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. Bomb damage to &quot;Enterprise&quot; on 24 August, torpedo damage to on 31 August, and the sinking of on 15 September left &quot;Hornet&quot; as the only operational U.S. carrier in the South Pacific. She was responsible for providing air cover over the Solomon Islands until 24 October 1942, when she was joined by &quot;Enterprise&quot; just northwest of the New Hebrides Islands. Both carriers and their escorts steamed out to intercept a Japanese aircraft carrier/battleship/cruiser force closing in on Guadalcanal.

==== Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands ====


The Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands took place on 26 October 1942 without contact between surface ships of the opposing forces. That morning, &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s planes bombed the carrier , while planes from &quot;Hornet&quot; severely damaged the carrier and the heavy cruiser . Two other cruisers were also attacked by &quot;Hornet&quot;″s aircraft. Meanwhile, &quot;Hornet&quot; was attacked by a coordinated dive bomber and torpedo plane attack. In a 15-minute period, &quot;Hornet&quot; was hit by three bombs from Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers. One &quot;Val&quot;, after being heavily damaged by antiaircraft fire while approaching &quot;Hornet&quot;, crashed into the carrier&#x27;s island, killing seven men and spreading burning aviation gas over the deck. A flight of Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bombers attacked &quot;Hornet&quot; and scored two hits, which seriously damaged the electrical systems and engines. As the carrier came to a halt, another damaged &quot;Val&quot; deliberately crashed into &quot;Hornet&quot;&#x27;s port side near the bow.

With power knocked out to her engines, &quot;Hornet&quot; was unable to launch or land aircraft, forcing her aviators to either land on &quot;Enterprise&quot; or ditch in the ocean. Rear Admiral George D. Murray ordered the heavy cruiser to tow &quot;Hornet&quot; clear of the action. Japanese aircraft were attacking &quot;Enterprise&quot;, allowing &quot;Northampton&quot; to tow &quot;Hornet&quot; at a speed of about . Repair crews were on the verge of restoring power when another flight of nine &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo planes attacked. Eight of these aircraft were either shot down or failed to score hits, but the ninth scored a fatal hit on the starboard side. The torpedo hit destroyed the repairs to the electrical system and caused a 14° list. After being informed that Japanese surface forces were approaching and that further towing efforts were futile, Vice Admiral William Halsey ordered &quot;Hornet&quot; sunk, and an order of &quot;abandon ship&quot; was issued. Captain Mason, the last man on board, climbed over the side, and the survivors were soon picked up by the escorting destroyers.

American warships attempted to scuttle the stricken carrier, which absorbed nine torpedoes, many of which failed to explode, and more than 400 rounds from the destroyers and . The destroyers steamed away when a Japanese surface force entered the area. The Japanese destroyers and finally finished off &quot;Hornet&quot; with 4 Long Lance torpedoes. At 01:35 on 27 October, &quot;Hornet&quot; finally capsized to starboard and sank, stern first, with the loss of 140 of her 2,200 sailors. 21 aircraft went down with the ship.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Hornet&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 January 1943. Her name was revived less than a year later when the newly constructed &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was commissioned as . CV-8 is honored aboard her namesake, which is now the USS &quot;Hornet&quot; Museum docked in Alameda, California.

&quot;Hornet&quot; was the last American fleet carrier (CV) ever sunk by enemy fire, though the light carrier &quot;Princeton&quot; and a number of much smaller escort carriers were sunk in combat in other battles following &quot;Hornet&quot;″s sinking.

=== Wreck discovery ===
In late January 2019, the research vessel located &quot;Hornet&quot;″s wreck at more than deep off the Solomon Islands. The expedition team, largely funded by Paul Allen, aboard the &quot;Petrel&quot;, used information from the archives of nine other U.S. warships that saw the carrier shortly before she was sunk. One of two robotic vehicles aboard the &quot;Petrel&quot; found the &quot;Hornet&quot; during its first dive mission. The carrier lies upright on the ocean floor, with her signal bridge and a section of her stern that broke away coming to rest around her.

== Awards ==
&quot;Hornet&quot; was awarded four battle stars during World War II.

In addition, Torpedo Squadron 8 flying from &quot;Hornet&quot; was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. &quot;for extraordinary heroism and distinguished service beyond the call of duty&quot; during the Battle of Midway.

<text>João Alberto Lins de Barros was a Brazilian politician in the early 20th century. He was appointed by Getúlio Vargas provisional governor in place of the elected governor of São Paulo. Elite paulistas loathed Alberto, resenting his centralization efforts and alarmed by his economic reforms, such as a mere 5% wage increase and some minor distribution of some land to participants in the revolution. Amid threats of revolt, Vargas replaced João Alberto with a civilian from São Paulo, appointed a conservative paulista banker as his minister of finance, and announced a date for the holding of a constituent assembly. The coffee oligarchs were only emboldened, launching the counterrevolutionary revolt in July 1932, which collapsed after some minor, lackadaisical combat.</text><links>

<text>USS &quot;Hornet&quot; (CV/CVA/CVS-12) is an &quot;Essex&quot;-class aircraft carrier built for the United States Navy (USN) during World War II. Completed in late 1943, the ship was assigned to the Fast Carrier Task Force (variously designated as Task Force 38 or 58) in the Pacific Ocean, the navy&#x27;s primary offensive force during the Pacific War. The ship was also used to recover the Apollo 11 crew.

In early 1944, she participated in attacks on Japanese installations in New Guinea, Palau and Truk among others. &quot;Hornet&quot; then took part in the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign and most of the subsidiary operations, most notably the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June that was nicknamed the &quot;Great Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot; for the disproportionate losses inflicted upon the Japanese. The ship then participated in the Philippines Campaign in late 1944, and the Volcano and Ryukyu Islands campaign in the first half of 1945. She was badly damaged by Typhoon Connie in June and had to return to the United States for repairs.

After the war she took part in Operation Magic Carpet, returning troops to the U.S. and was then placed in reserve in 1946. &quot;Hornet&quot; was reactivated during the Korean War of 1950–1953, but spent the rest of the war being modernized to allow her to operate jet-propelled aircraft. The ship was modernized again in the late 1950s for service as an anti-submarine carrier. She played a minor role in the Vietnam War during the 1960s and in the Apollo program, recovering the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 astronauts when they returned from the Moon.

&quot;Hornet&quot; was decommissioned in 1970. She was eventually designated as both a National Historic Landmark and a California Historical Landmark, and she opened to the public as the USS &quot;Hornet&quot; Museum in Alameda, California, in 1998.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Essex&quot;-class ships were much larger than the preceding s, which allowed them to carry more aircraft, armor, and armament. The initial ships had a length of overall and at the waterline, although this was revised to an overall length of in the &quot;long-hull&quot; sub-class when the bow was reshaped to accommodate a pair of quadruple mounts in the bow compared to the single mount in the earlier &quot;short-hull&quot; ships like &quot;Hornet&quot;.

All of the ships had a beam of at the waterline and a draft of at deep load. They displaced at standard load and at deep load. Their designed complement was approximately 268 officers and 2,362 enlisted men, but more men were added even before the ships were completed; the addition of more light weapons and other equipment greatly increased the overcrowding so that &quot;Hornet&quot;″s sister had a crew of 382 officers and 3,003 enlisted men in 1945. The ships had four geared steam turbines, each driving one shaft, using steam supplied by eight Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , enough to give a maximum speed of . The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at .

===Flight deck arrangements===
The short-hull &quot;Essex&quot;es had a flight deck that was long and had a maximum width of . Below it was a hangar with a height of . The hangar was connected to the flight deck by three aircraft elevators, two in the flight deck and a folding one on the port side of the flight deck, abreast the island. Catapult arrangements for the early &quot;Essex&quot;s varied between ships; &quot;Hornet&quot; was built with a single hydraulic catapult on the forward part of the flight deck and another was fitted transversely on the hangar deck. All of the &quot;Essex&quot;s were fitted with arresting gear to allow them to land aircraft over both the stern and the bow.

Early in the design process, the &quot;Essex&quot;s were intended to carry over 100 aircraft: 27 fighters, 37 scout or dive bombers, 18 torpedo bombers, three observation and two utility aircraft, plus 21 partially disassembled spares. Early war experience increased the number of fighters to 36 at the expense of the observation and utility aircraft and reduced the number of spares to nine. By mid-1945, the air group typically consisted of 36 or 37 fighters, an equal number of fighter bombers, and dive and torpedo squadrons of 15 aircraft apiece for a total of 103. By this time, the fighter squadrons included specialist photo-reconnaissance and night fighter aircraft.

===Armament, armor and electronics===

The main armament of the &quot;Essex&quot;-class ships consisted of a dozen 38-caliber  dual-purpose guns arranged in two superfiring pairs of twin-gun turrets fore and aft of the island and four guns in single mounts on the port side of the flight deck. These guns were controlled by a pair of Mk 37 directors, mounted on the top of the island; each director was fitted with a Mk 4 fire-control radar. The early short-hull &quot;Essex&quot;s were equipped with eight quadruple Bofors anti-aircraft (AA) guns; one mount each at the bow and stern, four atop the island and two on the port side of the flight deck, next to the 5-inch guns. Each mount was controlled by its own Mk 51 director. The carriers were also fitted with 46 Oerlikon  light AA guns on single mounts along the sides of the flight deck and on the island.

The waterline armor belt of the carriers was high, long and covered the middle 62% of the hull. It was thick, tapering to at its bottom edge. The hangar deck was also 2.5 inches thick and the protective deck below it was thick. Transverse 4-inch bulkheads closed off the ends of the belt armor to form the ship&#x27;s armored citadel. The steering gear was protected by 2.5-inches of special treatment steel.

The &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers were designed with little space reserved for radar and the additional systems added while under construction contributed to the general overcrowding of the crew and the cramped island of the ships. &quot;Hornet&quot; was completed with most of her radars mounted on the tripod mast atop her island. It carried the SK early-warning radar, SM height-finding radar and the SG surface search radar. A SC early-warning radar was positioned on a stub lattice mast on the starboard side of the funnel.

===Wartime modifications===
Changes to the numbers of 20 mm guns aboard &quot;Hornet&quot; during the war are not available in the sources, although she had 35 single mounts by the end of the war. The ship did not return to any naval base in Hawaii or the West Coast until July 1945 when she arrived at San Francisco, California, for repairs for her typhoon damage, so it is unlikely that any major modifications were done before then. Facilities in Ulithi Atoll were limited, but they had been able to install some of the new equipment that was fielded in late 1944 and 1945. Some of the ship&#x27;s Mk 51 directors may have been replaced by Mk 57 directors with an integral Mk 34 fire-control radar and the Mk 4 fire-control radar atop the Mk 37 directors may have been upgraded to a Mk 12 system that shared its mount with a Mk 22 height finder. The SP height finder was a lighter version of the SM and began to be installed in &quot;Essex&quot;-class ships in March 1945.

While being repaired, the Navy took the opportunity to refit the ship to the latest standard. Her SK radar was upgraded to a SK-2 model with a dish antenna that improved its performance and her hangar-deck catapult was replaced by one on the flight deck. Her island was remodeled to expand the flag bridge which caused the removal of the forward lower 40 mm mount on the island and 10 new quadruple mounts were added along the sides of the flight deck and the hull for a total of 68 guns in 17 mounts.

==Construction and career==

The Chief of Naval Operations had ordered three &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers on 10 May 1940 in anticipation of Congress passing the Two-Ocean Navy Act, although the ship that later became &quot;Hornet&quot; originally had the name &quot;Kearsarge&quot; with the hull number of CV-12. The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding on 9 September 1940, and her keel was laid down on 3 August 1942. The seventh was sunk in the Battle of Santa Cruz on 26 October 1942, and the CV-12 hull was renamed &quot;Hornet&quot; shortly afterwards. The ship was launched on 30 August 1943 with her sponsor being Annie Reid Knox, wife of Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox. She was commissioned on 29 November 1943 with Captain Miles R. Browning in command.

&quot;Hornet&quot; worked up off Bermuda before departing Norfolk, Virginia, on 14 February 1944 to join Task Force 58 at Majuro Atoll in the Marshall Islands where she arrived on 20 March. Two days later the Task Force departed to attack warships and airfields in the Palau Islands and the Kossol Roads to eliminate any threat to the scheduled operations in New Guinea and the Admiralty Islands. To block the exits from Kossol and trap all of the ships inside the lagoon, the torpedo bomber squadrons from &quot;Hornet&quot; and her sisters and had trained on aerial minelaying. To avoid detection, the American ships steamed far south of the Japanese naval base at Truk. They were spotted on the 28th and Admiral Mineichi Koga, commander of the Combined Fleet, ordered his warships to withdraw to Tawi-Tawi Island in the Philippines and for the merchant shipping to disperse.

As Task Force 58 approached its targets on the morning of 30 March, its carriers launched a fighter sweep that shot down 30 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters already airborne and they were soon followed by 39 Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers, each of which carried a pair of magnetic mines that effectively bottled up the 40-odd ships in Kossol Roads. This was the first and only time that carrier aircraft laid mines during the Pacific War. Despite reinforcing fighters that flew in overnight, the Americans sank 24 merchant and auxiliary ships, totaling nearly of shipping, plus two old destroyers, four subchasers and a pair of repair ships on 30 and 31 March. American pilots claimed to have shot down 63 aircraft and destroyed over 100 more on the ground while losing 25 aircraft of their own. On their way back to Majuro, the carriers attacked targets on Woleai on 1 April to little effect.

Before Task Force 58 departed Majuro on 13 April, Rear Admiral Joseph J. Clark had hoisted his flag in &quot;Hornet&quot; as commander of Task Group 58.1 that consisted of his flagship and the three light carriers, , and . The task group was ordered to attack Sarmi, Sawar, and Wakde Airfields in Western New Guinea while the other task groups supported the amphibious landings at Hollandia. There was little Japanese air activity while the ships were off New Guinea, although the Task Group&#x27;s fighters did shoot down two Mitsubishi G4M (Allied reporting name &quot;Betty&quot;) bombers that were searching for them. Task Force 58 withdrew to Seeadler Harbor on Manus Island on 25 April to replenish for a few days before leaving to attack the shore facilities at Truk. The Japanese spotted the ships during the night of 28/29 April, but their weak attack later that morning was ineffective and the 84 Grumman F6F Hellcats of the morning fighter sweep were opposed by about 60 Zeros. Bad weather and a heavy overcast prevented the Americans from gaining complete air superiority until the mid-afternoon, but they were able to severely damage the naval base&#x27;s infrastructure over the next two days. They lost 9 aircraft in accidents and 27 in combat, mostly to anti-aircraft fire while claiming 59 aircraft in the air and 34 on the ground.

En route to Majuro, Task Group 58.1 was detached to cover the bombardments of the airfields at Satawan and Ponape by the portions of the Task Force&#x27;s escorting ships. Both islands had already been previously attacked and little additional damage appears to have been done in exchange for the loss of one aircraft shot down by AA guns. Task Force 58 arrived at Majuro on 4 May and spent the next month preparing for the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign. The abrasive Browning had made many enemies and his mistakes led him to be relieved for cause on 29 May; he was replaced by Captain William Sample.

===Mariana and Palau Islands campaign===

By June &quot;Hornet&quot;″s air group (Carrier Air Group 2 (CVG-2)) mustered 40 Hellcat fighters, including 4 night-fighter versions, 33 Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bombers and 20 Avengers. Task Group 58.1 had exchanged &quot;Cowpens&quot; for &quot;Hornet&quot;″s sister so it mustered a pair each of fleet and light carriers for the campaign. Task Force 58 departed Majuro on 6 June in time to begin the air strikes on the southern Marianas six days later, three days prior to the planned amphibious assault on Saipan, although the Japanese discovered that it had left Majuro on 8 June. &quot;Hornet&quot;″s night fighters began shooting down Japanese reconnaissance aircraft on the night of 10 June. Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher, commander of the task force, decided to move the air strikes forward to 11 June, hoping to catch the Japanese off guard.

The task group&#x27;s fighters discovered 30 Zeros over Guam during their sweep and claimed to have shot them all down, with &quot;Hornet&quot;″s 16 Hellcats claiming 23 of them as kills. A picket line of destroyers was stationed between the carriers and Guam and they controlled interceptions by the task group&#x27;s fighters of about a dozen reconnaissance and attack aircraft that afternoon. The following days the task group continued to attack Guam to eliminate all of the aircraft based there as well as any reinforcements. Later that afternoon, &quot;Hornet&quot;″s aircraft discovered a seven-ship reinforcement convoy east of Guam, but it was too far away to attack if the aircraft were to land during daylight. That night the task group closed the distance while the convoy continued to approach Guam and was only when it launched 20 bomb-armed Hellcats. Their pilots were not trained for anti-shipping missions and failed to significantly damage the ships of the convoy before it reached Guam.

The new commander of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Soemu Toyoda, was uncertain if the Americans were merely attacking the Japanese facilities in the Marianas until the fast battleships escorting Task Force 58 were detached to make a preliminary bombardment of Saipan on 13 June. Even before he received the report of the bombardment, he ordered the 1st Mobile Fleet to move forward to Guimaras Island to start training their inexperienced aviators in a more protected environment. He then alerted all forces to prepare to implement Plan A-Go, effective on 19 June, once he had word of the bombardment. The plan was intended to inflict a decisive defeat on the USN and cause the American government to sue for peace after the collapse of public will to continue the war. An American submarine spotted the movement and alerted Vice Admiral Raymond Spruance, commander of the entire operation. Not knowing the Japanese intentions, he believed that the Japanese ships would not be able to attack before 17 June. To take advantage of this window of opportunity to destroy Japanese aerial reinforcements gathering in the Bonin Islands, Spruance ordered Task Groups 58.1 and 58.4 to rendezvous on the 14th, attack the airbases there the following day and return in time to concentrate for the battle that he expected on the 17th.

On 15 June, fighters from the two task groups conducted fighter sweeps over Iwo Jima, Hahajima and Chichi Jima, claiming to have shot down 20 Zeros over Iwo Jima for the loss of two Hellcats. Clark stationed his nightfighters over Iwo Jima that night to prevent the Japanese from launching reconnaissance missions or air strikes before launching more air strikes on the 16th. The bulk of the reinforcements intended for A-Go were still in Japan at this time, but the American carriers claimed to have destroyed a total of 81 aircraft, including 40 in the air, for the loss of four aircraft in combat and seven others in crashes, before departing the area later that afternoon.

====Battle of the Philippine Sea====
Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa, commander of the 1st Mobile Fleet, ordered A-Go to begin on 16 April while he concentrated and refueled his forces east of the Philippines. At nightfall on the 17th his ships were spotted by an American submarine some west of Saipan, although Spruance did not receive its report until the early morning of 18 June. Japanese reconnaissance aircraft located Task Force 58 on that afternoon, but the shorter-ranged American aircraft failed to find the Japanese carriers. Ozawa decided to attack on the 19th rather than subject his inexperienced pilots to night landings that they had not trained for and turned south to keep the range from the Americans constant. Spruance had no idea where the Japanese were until a radio transmission from Ozawa was triangulated at a point west of his task force on the night of the 18th. A radar-equipped Martin PBM Mariner patrol bomber discovered the 1st Mobile Fleet at 01:15 on 19 June, but its message was not received for another eight hours due to radio troubles. The early morning searches by the Americans were not successful, but the Japanese had been tracking them continuously since 01:00.

That night the Americans had tracked reinforcements flying from Truk to Guam and Mitscher ordered fighters from Task Group 58.1 to patrol over Orote Field. Hellcats from &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; were the first to engage Japanese aircraft taking off at 07:00 and they had to be reinforced by fighters from &quot;Hornet&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot;. By 09:30 they had claimed to have shot down 45 fighters and 5 other aircraft while only losing a pair of Hellcats. At that time &quot;Hornet&quot; launched an air strike of 17 Helldivers and 7 Avengers, escorted by a dozen Hellcats, that bombed Orote without encountering Japanese aircraft. At 09:50 an incoming Japanese air strike had been picked up on radar and the carriers turned into the wind to begin launching 140 fighters; at 10:04, the fighters patrolling over Guam were summoned to reinforce the Combat Air Patrol (CAP) over Task Force 58, although they were too late to participate in the aerial battle. The CAP, reinforced by the newly launched Hellcats, intercepted the Japanese, shooting down 40 of the 57 Zeros involved and seriously disrupting the Japanese attack which only inflicted minor damage on one battleship. &quot;Hornet&quot; contributed Hellcats who claimed to have shot down nine Zeros and three Nakajima B6N &quot;Jill&quot; torpedo bombers. The second wave of aircraft was detected at 11:07, but &quot;Hornet&quot;″s fighters did not participate in their defeat. The third wave was given erroneous locations for the American ships and were northwest of them at 12:40. Most of them turned back, but about a dozen did not and were detected by Task Group 58.1 at 12:56. They were intercepted by 17 Hellcats from &quot;Hornet&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot; which shot down six Zeros and a Jill, with &quot;Hornet&quot;″s fighters claiming nine aircraft in exchange for a damaged Hellcat. The fourth wave was also misdirected and most of the aircraft decided to continue onwards and land on Guam. They arrived there around 15:00 and were intercepted by 41 Hellcats from &quot;Hornet&quot;, her sister , &quot;Cowpens&quot; and . They shot down 40 of the 49 aircraft; two of &quot;Hornet&quot;″s pilots shot down five Japanese aircraft as they were attempting to land.

A group of 295 Hellcats, together with five Avengers and Dauntlesses, had engaged the Japanese during the day and they shot down 208 aircraft of the 373 flown off by the carriers. The Americans lost seven Hellcats at sea, nine over Guam and six by accidents; seven bombers had been shot down by AA guns over Guam and two others had crashed. All told they lost 31 aircraft to all causes during the day. The Japanese lost 35 aircraft in accidents and aboard the two carriers sunk by submarines during the battle, together with 18 Guam-based aircraft shot down and 52 destroyed on the ground for a grand total of 313 to all causes, an exchange ratio of almost exactly 10:1 in favor of the Americans. Not without cause did they nickname the battle &quot;The Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot;.
At dusk, the Japanese turned away to the northwest to regroup and to refuel and the Americans turned west to close the distance. They discovered the retiring Japanese fleet during the afternoon of the following day and Mitscher ordered an air strike launched even though it meant recovering the aircraft at night. It consisted of 54 Avengers and 51 Helldivers, escorted by 85 Hellcats. The Japanese carriers launched their remaining 68 Zeros of which all but three were shot down for the loss of 20 American aircraft to all causes. &quot;Hornet&quot;″s aircraft badly damaged the carrier while the other aircraft sank the carrier , two tankers and lightly damaged three other carriers and a few other ships. Clark ordered his task group to turn on their lights to guide his pilots home before Mitscher ordered the entire task force to do the same. Despite these precautions, six Hellcats, 35 Helldivers and 28 Avengers were lost in deck-landing accidents or ran out of fuel, although most of their crews were rescued that night or over the next few days.

===Follow-on attacks===
After refuelling on 22 June, most of Task Force 58 sailed to Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands, but Clark took his task group north to attack the Bonins again to interdict any reinforcements for the Marianas. A reconnaissance aircraft spotted his ships on the morning of the 22nd and alerted the Japanese defenders. They scrambled about 60 Zeros and a few Yokosuka D4Y &quot;Judy&quot; dive bombers to intercept the inbound 51 Hellcats. They shot down 6 Hellcats for the loss of 24 Zeros and 5 Judys. The Japanese had enough remaining aircraft to mount two attacks against the task group. The first airstrike of about 20 torpedo bombers had every aircraft shot down by fighters and anti-aircraft fire and the second of 23 Zeros, 9 Judys and 9 Jills never found the American ships. They were intercepted and the Hellcats shot down 10 Zeros and 7 Jills.

 The task group arrived at Eniwetok on 27 June and departed to attack the Bonins again three days later, now reinforced by Task Group 58.2. They attacked on 3–4 July; the surviving nine Zeros and eight torpedo bombers attempt to do equal damage to their enemy, but lost five Zeros and seven bombers without inflicting any damage on the ships. The task groups relieved Task Group 58.4, which had been supporting the fighting on Saipan, and remained there a week before returning to Eniwetok. In late July, Task Group 58.1 attacked Japanese bases in Yap and nearby islands before attacking the Bonins again on 4–5 August; it arrived back at Eniwetok on the 9th.

That same day, Sample was relieved to take command of a carrier division and Captain Austin Doyle replaced him. Unwilling to serve under Vice Admiral William Halsey, Clark hauled down his flag and was relieved by Vice Admiral John McCain on 18 August. Clark remained aboard &quot;Hornet&quot; to assist McCain however he might and to serve as the reserve carrier-experienced admiral in case of need. Eight days later, Halsey relieved Spruance and Task Force 58 was redesignated as Task Force 38.

In a strategy conference in Pearl Harbor in July, President Franklin Roosevelt agreed with General Douglas MacArthur that the Philippines, an American territory, would be liberated and they set the date for 20 December. This required a series of preliminary operations to assault the Japanese bases in the western Caroline Islands and the approaches to the Philippines, including Yap and the Palaus. Mitscher began the process by taking three of his task groups, including &quot;Hornet&quot;″s TG 38.1, to attack the Palaus on 6–8 September before moving further west to attack Mindanao on 9–10 September, the southernmost large island of the Philippines. Encouraged by the lack of opposition, Halsey ordered Mitscher to attack the central Philippine islands, including Leyte and the other Visayan Islands. Resistance was weak during the attacks on 12–13 September and the American pilots claimed 173 aircraft shot down, 305 destroyed on the ground and 59 ships sunk for the loss of 9 aircraft to all causes. The reality was slightly different, the First Air Fleet defending the central Philippines had a strength of 176 aircraft before the American attacks and 85 after them; the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force (IJAAF) lost 31–40 aircraft during the attacks.

One of &quot;Hornet&quot;″s Hellcats was shot down off Leyte on 10 September. The pilot was rescued by Filipino fishermen and he had been contacted by members of the Filipino Resistance and informed that there was no Japanese garrison on Leyte. Halsey, coupling this information with the weak resistance put up by the Japanese during his raids on the Philippines, believed that most of the preliminary attacks planned before invading Luzon on 20 December, could be skipped and suggested to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the landing date be moved forward to 20 October. They agreed, although Admiral Chester Nimitz, commander of the Pacific Fleet, still required that he should conduct those parts of the plan regarding seizing bases in the Palaus and the Western Carolines.

Halsey sent TG 38.1 south to attack Japanese airfields in the area during the invasion of Morotai that began on the 15th, but summoned them back to rejoin the bulk of TF 38 before his planned attack on Manila on 21 September. &quot;Hornet&quot;″s aircraft participated in the second wave of attacks on Manila Bay and sank the elderly destroyer . The American pilots claimed to have shot down 110 aircraft and destroyed 95 on the ground, although the First Air Fleet actually lost less than two dozen aircraft to all causes. TF38 claimed to have sunk or damaged seven oil tankers, but Japanese records show that nine were sunk or wrecked. Bad weather forced the cancellation of most of the airstrikes planned for the second day, but Halsey decided to attack Coron Bay in the Calamian Islands instead, an anchorage often used by Japanese oilers, on the other side of the Philippines with TGs 38.1 and 38.3. &quot;Hornet&quot;″s air group led the combined airstrike which sank two oilers, six freighters, several escorts and the seaplane tender . TG 38.1 then sailed to Seeadler Harbor to replenish and exchange Air Group 2 for Air Group 11. Clark finally departed &quot;Hornet&quot; on 1 October.

===Liberation of the Philippines===

The four carrier groups of TF 38 rendezvoused west of the Marianas on 7 October, after weathering a typhoon that inflicted only minor damage. At this time, &quot;Hornet&quot;″s Air Group 11 consisted of 39 Hellcats, 25 Helldivers and 18 Avengers. After refueling the following day, they proceeded north with the mission of destroying Japanese aircraft that could reinforce the defenses of the Philippines. Analysis of American radio traffic had alerted the Japanese and they were expecting an attack along the arc between the Ryukyu Islands and Formosa or in the northern Philippines. The Americans obliged with an attack on the Ryukyus on 10 October, claiming to have shot down over 100 aircraft while losing 21 of their own to all causes. This attack caused the Japanese to activate the Sho-1 and Sho-2 variants of their plan that provided for the defense of the Philippines and for the islands between the Philippines and Japan. As part of the plan, the carrier-based aircraft would operate from land bases. After recovering their aircraft, TF 38 headed south that night to refuel east of Luzon the next day. In the early afternoon of 11 October, TG 38.1 and 38.4 launched an airstrike again the airfield in Aparri, on the northern coast of Luzon, which claimed to have destroyed 15 aircraft on the ground.

====Attack on Formosa====
Before dawn, TF 38 launched a fighter sweep of 199 Hellcats against an alerted defense which already had fighters in the air. Despite this, Japanese losses were very heavy while the Americans lost 48 aircraft to all causes on 12 October. Throughout the night, the Japanese made multiple attacks, losing 42 aircraft to no effect. Another series of airstrikes followed on 13 October, although fewer defending aircraft made an appearance and TF 38&#x27;s carriers lost 12 aircraft to all causes. At twilight, torpedo bombers attacked TG 38.1; &quot;Hornet&quot; evaded one torpedo that eventually crippled the heavy cruiser . Halsey had originally planned to withdraw that night to refuel on the 14th, but he had plenty of fuel left and decided to attack the airfields from which the Japanese might mount attacks on &quot;Canberra&quot; as she was towed westwards. Little opposition was encountered when the naval aviators flew their morning airstrike over Formosa and the carriers began to withdraw that afternoon, having lost 23 aircraft to all causes. TG 38.1 remained behind to protect the ships escorting &quot;Canberra&quot;. The Japanese repeated their twilight attacks against TG 38.1 and managed to cripple the light cruiser with a torpedo, but both cruisers reached Ulithi about a week later. Admitted Japanese losses during the airstrikes and on the attacks on the fleet amounted to 492 aircraft, including 100 from the IJAAF.

On 18 October TG 38.1 rendezvoused with TG 38.4 off the eastern coast of Luzon. Later that morning TG 38.1&#x27;s aircraft attacked targets near Clark Air Base and San Bernardino Strait, losing seven aircraft to all causes. Pilots claimed to have shot down 30 aircraft and to have destroyed 29 more on the ground. The following day, the aviators were tasked to attack airfields near Clark Air Base and Manila and claimed to have destroyed 23 aircraft on the ground. After recovering their aircraft, both task groups headed south to where they could support the amphibious landings on Leyte scheduled for 20 October. Halsey ordered on 19 October that the air groups aboard the &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers be reorganized with 54 fighters, 24 Helldivers and 18 Avengers, using locally available replacement aircraft beginning on 29 October.

That morning TG 38.1 launched a fighter sweep over northern Mindanao; there was no evidence of Japanese aerial activity in the air or on the ground. One aircraft was reportedly destroyed at Del Monte Airfield and six others were damaged. Both task groups launched large airstrikes later that morning to attack the defenses of the landing beaches themselves and the area immediately behind them. Their effectiveness was inhibited by the dense foliage, heavy smoke in the air and the large number of aircraft involved over a relatively small area. Many aircraft had to wait almost two hours before receiving their targets for lack of sufficient communications channels. That evening the task groups departed the area to refuel the next morning, returning to the area by the morning of the 22nd, although the bad weather prevented most flying. That evening Halsey ordered TG 38.1 to proceed to Ulithi to prepare for the attacks on the Japanese mainland scheduled for 11 November. After receiving reports of Japanese surface ships in the Sibuyan Sea, Halsey ordered the task group to reverse course on the night of 23/24 October.

====Battle off Samar====

The task group was too far away to intervene when the Japanese surprised the American escort carriers off the coast of Samar on the morning of 25 October with their force of battleships and cruisers, but McCain&#x27;s carriers were able to close the distance enough by the early afternoon to launch two long-range airstrikes that accomplished little. The Americans lost 14 aircraft to all causes and failed to significantly damage any of Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s ships. The following morning, after TG 38.1 and 38.2 rendezvoused, they launched an 257-aircraft airstrike that attacked Kurita&#x27;s ships. Avengers from &quot;Hornet&quot; and &quot;Cowpens&quot; hit the light cruiser with one bomb that started a quickly extinguished fire. About 20 minutes later another Avenger put a torpedo into the cruiser; the detonation disabled all of her boilers and left her dead in the water. About an hour and a half after that, 28 of &quot;Hornet&quot;″s Avengers and Helldivers hit &quot;Noshiro&quot; again with a torpedo and she sank an hour later.

Afterwards TG 38.1 resumed their interrupted voyage to Ulithi on the 27th. Four days later McCain relieved Mitscher as commander of TF 38 and Rear Admiral Alfred Montgomery assumed command of TG 38.1. The task group, together with TGs 38.2 and 38.3 returned to the Philippines in early November and attacked airfields in Luzon on 5 November, claiming to have destroyed 439 aircraft, most on the ground, while losing 36 aircraft to all causes. The aviators sank the heavy cruiser , an oiler and a cargo ship. On 11 November a troop convoy heading for Ormoc Bay was spotted; it was attacked by a large airstrike that sank five troop ships and four of the escorting destroyers despite its defending fighters for the loss of 9 US aircraft. Two days later TF 38 attacked Manila again and sank the light cruiser , four destroyers and seven merchant ships. The aviators claimed to have damaged 43 other ships and destroyed 84 aircraft while losing 25 aircraft. McCain attacked Manila again on 19 November, but with much less effect; sinking three merchantmen, damaging 13 others and claimed to have destroyed 116 aircraft, mostly on the ground, for the loss of 13 planes in combat. TGs 38.1 and 38.2 attacked targets in Luzon on the 25th, sinking the crippled heavy cruiser and a few smaller ships, and claimed to have shot down 26 Japanese aircraft and destroyed 29 on the ground. Having interdicted the flow of reinforcements to Leyte and maintained control of the air over the Philippines, the carriers retired to Ulithi to recuperate now that the Army Air Force had enough operable aircraft of its own to assume those roles. After &quot;Hornet&quot; arrived there, Clark hoisted his flag aboard her again, although he was not in command of the task group.

The increasing threat from kamikaze suicide aircraft that had damaged seven carriers since the invasion of Leyte caused the navy to reassess its air group composition. Fighters were obviously needed more to intercept the kamikazes before they could reach the fleet so the groups were reorganized to consist of 73 fighters and 15 dive and torpedo bombers each. The change would take several months to implement and a single fighter squadron that large would prove to be too big for one man to lead, so they were split into two squadrons in January 1945.

====Battle of Mindoro====

The temporary loss of the damaged carriers for repairs caused the reorganization of TG 38 in which &quot;Hornet&quot; was transferred to TG 38.2 for the upcoming operations in support of the assault on Mindoro scheduled for 5 December. The landings were postponed 10 days and TF 38 sortied on 11 December. The ship mustered 51 Hellcats, 15 Helldivers and 18 Avengers at this time. For this operation, the Army would cover all targets south of Manila, the escort carriers would provide direct support while the fast carriers would gain air supremacy over Luzon. Starting on the 14th, TF 38 flew continuous missions in support of that objective until they had to refuel three days later. The aviators claimed to have destroyed 269 aircraft, mostly on the ground, sunk a few merchant ships and heavily damaged roads and railroads while losing 27 aircraft in combat and 38 to accidents. The task force was unable to refuel on the 17th due to worsening weather and another attempt the next morning also failed before Halsey sailed unwittingly into the path of Typhoon Cobra later that day. Low on fuel, many ships were top-heavy and rolled heavily which sometimes broke aircraft free from their tie-down chains. Across the fleet 146 aircraft were destroyed, three light carriers were damaged when aircraft broke loose inside the hangars and three destroyers were sunk. The Third Fleet was able to refuel on 19 December, but follow-on operations over Luzon scheduled for the 21st had to be canceled when the Americans realized that the typhoon was over Luzon, so TF 38 returned to Ulithi.

====South China Sea raid====
On 30 December, TF 38 departed Ulithi to attack Japanese airfields and shipping in Formosa, French Indo-China, Luzon, China, the Ryukyus and the Pescadores Islands in support of the scheduled landings at Lingayen Gulf in Luzon on 9 January 1945 and to interdict the maritime traffic between the Japanese home islands and her conquests in Southeast Asia. The carriers first attacked Formosa on 3–4 January before turning to Luzon for airstrikes on the 6th and 7th and then returned to bomb targets in Formosa on the 9th. While claiming to have destroyed over 150 aircraft with little aerial opposition, the Americans lost 46 aircraft in combat and 40 more in accidents. With his obligation to cover the Lingayen Gulf area until the landings were done, Halsey&#x27;s ships entered the South China Sea during the night of 9–10 January in search of the two s that had been partially turned into seaplane carriers and had been mistakenly reported at Cam Ranh Bay.

After refueling on the 11th, the carriers flew off almost 1,500 sorties against targets in French Indochina and off the coast. Halsey turned his ships northward and attacked Formosa and the Hong Kong area on 15–16 January and reattacked Formosa on the 21st after having exited the South China Sea. Until this date, the Third Fleet had not been attacked by the Japanese, but the kamikazes badly damaged &quot;Hornet&quot;″s sister . En route back to Ulithi, TF 38&#x27;s planes flew reconnaissance missions over Okinawa on 22 January to aid the planned invasion of that island while also attacking Japanese positions. All told the carriers destroyed some 300,000 GRT of shipping and claimed to have destroyed 615 aircraft while losing 201 aircraft to all causes during their excursion.

===Volcano and Ryukyu Islands campaign===

On 27 January, Spruance relieved Halsey, Clark assumed command of TG 58.1 and brought &quot;Hornet&quot; back to the task group. The fast carriers, now renumbered as TF 58, departed Ulithi on 10 February for full-scale aerial assaults on the Tokyo area scheduled for 16–17 February that were intended to isolate Iwo Jima. TF 58&#x27;s pilots claimed to have shot down 341 aircraft and destroyed 190 on the ground; attacks on industrial targets were not very effective and little shipping was sunk, with the most notable example being the recently completed Imperial Japanese Army escort carrier &quot;Yamashio Maru&quot;. The Japanese admitted losing at least 78 aircraft in aerial combat while claiming to having shot down 134 aircraft themselves; the Americans lost 88 aircraft to all causes. The Japanese did not attack TF 58 during their time off the coast of Honshu.

The carriers turned south late in the afternoon of the 17th to prepare to support the amphibious landings on Iwo Jima on 19 February. TG 58.1 was refueling on the day of the landing, but joined the other task groups providing close support for the Marines ashore on the 20th. Three days later, Spruance released the fast carriers to attack the Japanese Home Islands again in an attempt to neutralize the kamikaze threat. Bad weather limited the effectiveness of the airstrikes around Tokyo on 25 January; continued bad weather forced the cancellation of the airstrikes planned the following day despite moving southwards overnight. Mitscher refueled his ships on the 27th and turned south to attack Okinawa on 1 March before returning to Ulithi on the 4th. American claims were 52 aircraft shot down and more than 60 destroyed on the ground in exchange for 55 aircraft lost to all causes between 19 February and 1 March.

While refitting in Ulithi, Air Group 17 relieved Air Group 11 aboard the &quot;Hornet&quot; before departing on the 14th for another series of attacks on Japan in preparation for the invasion of Okinawa. A Japanese reconnaissance aircraft spotted TF 58 on 17 March which allowed the Japanese to disperse their aircraft and hide them. American attacks on the airfields in Kyushu were largely ineffective and were fiercely opposed. &quot;Hornet&quot;″s Fighter Squadron 17 encountered many fighters over Kanoya Air Field and claimed to have shot down 25 of them. Japanese attacks on TF 58 lightly damaged three carriers, none of which were under Clark&#x27;s command. American fighter pilots claimed 126 aircraft shot down and the Japanese admitted losing 110 aircraft, including 32 kamikazes.
Reconnaissance aircraft had located the remnants of the IJN in Kure and Kobe on the 18th and Mitscher ordered TGs 58.1, 58.3 and 58.4 to attack the former port. The Japanese caught Clark&#x27;s carriers with their decks full of aircraft, preparing to fly off the morning&#x27;s airstrike, but all of the attack aircraft were shot down; one kamikaze crashed a thousand yards (910 meters) astern of &quot;Hornet&quot; and two other were splashed by her sister ″s gunners. After the airstrikes flew off, further Japanese attacks crippled her sister . As they approached Kure, the 20 Hellcats of &quot;Hornet&quot;″s Fighter-Bomber Squadron 17 encountered 40 fighters from the IJAAF&#x27;s elite 434rd Kokutai. In a battle which lasted 25 minutes, six American and four Japanese fighters were shot down. The total casualties from the day&#x27;s fighting over Japan, including the engagement between VBF-17 and the 434rd Kokutai, was 14 American and 25 Japanese aircraft shot down. The attacks on the warships in Kure were fairly ineffectual, with the American pilots lightly damaging four battleships and many other warships, but badly damaging only a single escort carrier and a light cruiser. &quot;Hornet&quot; lost 13 aircraft in combat during the day. The afternoon&#x27;s scheduled airstrikes were canceled to allow TF 58 to protect its damaged ships as they withdrew; further attacks on 20 and 21 March failed to significantly damage any more ships.

TF 58 aircraft began hitting Okinawa on 23 March. The following day, TG 581.1 reconnaissance aircraft spotted a convoy that consisted of two troop transports, an ammunition ship and five escorts off Amami Ōshima headed for Okinawa; an 112-aircraft airstrike from Clark&#x27;s carriers sank them all. Mitscher&#x27;s carriers continued to attack Okinawa, ultimately flying a total of 3,095 sorties in the last seven days of March. The Japanese heavily attacked TF 58 between 26 and 31 March and damaged 10 ships, at the cost of around 1,100 aircraft. On 1 April, &quot;Hornet&quot;″s planes began to provide direct support to the forces landing on Okinawa. Five days later the Japanese launched a mass airstrike on 6 April that consisted to almost 700 planes, of which at least 355 were kamikazes. Mitscher cleared his flight decks of all non fighters and his pilots claimed to have shot down a total of 249 aircraft. Despite this, three destroyers, two ammunition ships, and one Landing Ship, Tank were sunk by kamikazes and eight destroyers, a destroyer escort and a minelayer were damaged. The following day, the Japanese continued to attack, albeit with fewer aircraft. Kamikazes damaged &quot;Hornet&quot;″s sister , one battleship, a destroyer and a destroyer escort.

====Operation Ten-Go====

Operation Ten-Go (&quot;Ten-gō sakusen&quot;) was the attempted attack by a strike force of 10 Japanese surface vessels, led by the large battleship &quot;Yamato&quot;. This small task force had been ordered to fight through enemy naval forces, then beach &quot;Yamato&quot; and fight from shore, using her guns as coastal artillery and her crew as naval infantry. The &quot;Ten-Go&quot; force was spotted by American submarines shortly after it put to sea on 6 April. Reconnaissance aircraft from TF 58 found the force the following morning and TG 58.1 began launching aircraft almost two hours later. &quot;Hornet&quot;″s Avengers put at least one torpedo into the battleship, the first of the ten torpedoes and five bomb hits that sank her less than two hours later. Of &quot;Yamato&quot;″s screening force, the light cruiser and four of the seven destroyers were also sunk or scuttled. The Americans lost three fighters, four dive bombers and three torpedo bombers to all causes during the attack.

On 8 April, TF 58 returned to its previous mission of providing support to the US forces ashore, although continued kamikaze attacks exacted a toll. A week later, Mitscher ordered a fighter sweep over Kyushu to focus Japanese attention on his ships rather the more vulnerable amphibious shipping sustaining the ongoing battle. His pilots claimed to have shot down 29 aircraft and destroyed 51 on the ground. His strategy worked and the kamikazes attacked TF 58 on 17 April, badly damaging &quot;Intrepid&quot; despite Clark&#x27;s pilots claiming 72 attackers. The fast carriers returned to Okinawan waters and none of them were damaged by a kamikaze until 11 May. When the weather worsened in late April, Mitscher sent TG 58.1 to Ulithi to refit and rest his exhausted crews on the 27th. After Clark&#x27;s ships rejoined him on 12 May, Mitscher sent TG 58.1 and 58.3 the next day to attack airfields in Kyushu and Shikoku. Over 13–14 May, their pilots claimed to have shot down 72 aircraft and destroyed 73 on the ground while losing 14 aircraft. The Japanese evened the score when they badly damaged &quot;Enterprise&quot; on the 14th.
Halsey and McCain reassumed command and the task force resumed its former designation as TF 38 on 27–28 May, after the pace of aerial combat had slowed down. Bad weather forced the cancellation of air support over Okinawa on 30 May and on 1–3 June. Clark was able to refuel on the following day, despite worsening weather. He took his ships eastwards, hoping to avoid the developing typhoon to his southwest. Halsey, however, ordered him to steer northwestwards shortly after midnight on the 5th to position his ships for the planned airstrikes on Kyushu, which put TG 38.1 right into the path of the typhoon. Despite multiple requests to alter course to avoid the eye of the typhoon, the task group entered the eyewall region, where the most violent weather in a typhoon is located, around dawn when Clark was finally granted the freedom to maneuver. Shortly afterwards a massive wave crashed down on &quot;Hornet&quot;″s bow which collapsed some of her forward flight deck. Not long afterwards the same thing happened to &quot;Bennington&quot; and the bow was ripped off the heavy cruiser . Only six men were killed during the storm, but 76 airplanes were destroyed or lost overboard and 70 were damaged. Both &quot;Hornet&quot; and &quot;Bennington&quot; were unable to launch their aircraft over the bow, which was unfortunately confirmed when a Marine Vought F4U Corsair attempted to fly off &quot;Hornet&quot;, but almost immediately flipped over and spun into the sea upon takeoff.

Clark ordered that the damaged sisters steam backwards at and launch their aircraft over the stern on 7 June as they provided the CAP over the task group. He detached &quot;Bennington&quot; for repairs the next day while &quot;Hornet&quot;″s aircraft participated in the attack on Kanoya Air Field. On 9 April, McCain had Clark&#x27;s aircraft demonstrate the effectiveness of napalm bombs on the coastal defenses of Okidaitōjima, southeast of Okinawa. The following day, his planes spotted for three battleships as they bombarded Minamidaitōjima. After arriving in Leyte on 13 June, Clark relinquished command of the task group and &quot;Hornet&quot; was ordered home for repairs, arriving in San Francisco on 7 July. &quot;Hornet&quot; earned seven battle stars and the Presidential Unit Citation for her service in the war.

Her repairs and refit were complete by 13 September, after which she was assigned to Operation Magic Carpet that had her ferry troops home from the Marianas and Hawaiian Islands, returning to San Francisco on 9 February 1946. &quot;Hornet&quot; was decommissioned on 15 January 1947 and assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

===Peacetime tensions: 1951 to 1959===

&quot;&quot;Hornet&quot; was recommissioned on 20 March 1951, then sailed from San Francisco for the New York Naval Shipyard, where she was decommissioned on 12 May for conversion to an attack aircraft carrier CVA-12, under the SCB-27A upgrade program.&quot; Her sister badly damaged her bow in a collision on 26 April 1952; &quot;Hornet&quot;″s bow was cut away and used to repair &quot;Wasp&quot;. &quot;On 11 September 1953, she was recommissioned as an attack carrier. The ship then trained in the Caribbean Sea before departure from Norfolk on 11 May 1954 on an eight-month global cruise.&quot;

&quot;After operations in the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, &quot;Hornet&quot; joined the mobile 7th Fleet in the South China Sea to search for survivors of a Cathay Pacific Airways passenger plane, shot down by Chinese aircraft near Hainan Island. On 25 July, &quot;Hornet&quot; aircraft supported planes from as they shot down two attacking Chinese fighters. After tensions eased, she returned to San Francisco on 12 December, trained out of San Diego, then sailed on 4 May 1955 to join the 7th Fleet in the Far East. &quot;Hornet&quot; helped to cover the evacuation of Vietnamese from the Communist-controlled north to South Vietnam, then ranged from Japan to Formosa, Okinawa, and the Philippines in readiness training with the 7th Fleet. She returned to San Diego on 10 December and entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard the following month for the SCB-125 upgrade.&quot;
&quot;Following her modernization overhaul, &quot;Hornet&quot; operated along the California coast. She departed San Diego on 21 January 1957 to bolster the strength of the 7th Fleet until her return from the troubled Far East on 25 July. Following a similar cruise, 6 January – 2 July 1958,&quot; she entered Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in August, to begin the conversion into an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) carrier. &quot;On 3 April 1959, she sailed from Long Beach to join the 7th Fleet in antisubmarine warfare tactics ranging from Japan to Okinawa and the Philippines. She returned home in October, for training along the western seaboard.&quot; In the late 1950s, an anti-submarine air group consisted of one squadron with 20 twin-engined Grumman S2F Trackers ASW aircraft, a squadron of HSS-1 Seabat ASW helicopters and a detachment of Douglas AD-5W Skyraider airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft. A detachment of four McDonnell F2H Banshee fighters was often assigned to protect the other aircraft. After 1960, the ASW air group generally consisted of two squadrons of ASW aircraft, each of 10 Trackers, a helicopter squadron of 16 Seabats or Sikorsky SH-3 Sea Kings and an AEW detachment with Grumman E-1 Tracers. No fighters were assigned between 1960 and 1965. Afterwards, the ASW carriers sometimes received a detachment of Douglas A-4 Skyhawk attack aircraft.

===Vietnam and the Space Race: 1960 to 1970===
&quot;In the following years, &quot;Hornet&quot; was regularly deployed to the 7th Fleet for operations ranging from the coast of South Vietnam, to the shores of Japan, the Philippines and Okinawa&quot;; she also played a key part in the Apollo program, as a recovery ship for uncrewed and crewed spaceflights. On 6 March 1965, a Sea King helicopter took off from &quot;Hornet&quot; in San Diego and flew to the aircraft carrier , off Naval Station Mayport, Florida, without refueling or landing. It covered a distance of in 16 hours, 52 minutes, and set a Fédération Aéronautique Internationale world record for helicopters. This exceeded the previous record distance by more than . &quot;Hornet&quot; was deployed to Vietnam for the first time from October 1965 to January 1966, by this time all of the ASW carriers had received the SCB-144 upgrade as part of the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization II program. They received an AN/SQS-23 sonar mounted in the bow, as well as improved displays in the Combat Information Center. During these deployments the carriers were responsible for escorting the attack carriers in the South China Sea and providing combat search and rescue. Their Skyhawks were occasionally used to attack ground targets. On 20 September 1965, the destroyer &#x27;s steering malfunctioned and collided with &quot;Hornet&quot; while refueling. Nobody was injured on either ship, but both were lightly damaged.

On 25 August 1966, she was on recovery station for the flight of AS-202, the second uncrewed flight of production Apollo Command and Service Modules. The moonship rocketed three-quarters of the way around the globe in 93 minutes before splashdown near Wake Island. Scorched from the heat of its re-entry into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, the Apollo space capsule, designed to carry American astronauts to the Moon, was brought aboard &quot;Hornet&quot; after its test; that command module is currently on display aboard &quot;Hornet&quot;.

&quot;&quot;Hornet&quot; returned to Long Beach on 8 September, but headed back to the Far East on 27 March 1967. She reached Japan exactly a month later and departed the Sasebo base on 19 May for the war zone.&quot; She operated in Vietnamese waters until October and returned for another deployment from November 1968 to April 1969. After the North Koreans shot down a Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star AEW aircraft on 14 April over international waters, &quot;Hornet&quot; was ordered to reinforce the American ships gathering in the area in what became a pointless show of force.

&quot;Hornet&quot; recovered the three astronauts (Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Buzz Aldrin) and their command module &quot;Columbia&quot; from the first Moon landing mission, Apollo 11, after splashdown about 900 miles southwest of Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean on 24 July 1969. President Nixon was on board to welcome the returning astronauts back to Earth, where they lived in quarantine aboard &quot;Hornet&quot; prior to transfer to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at Houston. &quot;Hornet&quot; also recovered Apollo 12 on 24 November. Returning astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr., Alan L. Bean, and Richard F. Gordon, Jr., were picked up from their splashdown point near American Samoa.

===Retirement: 1970 to present===
&quot;Hornet&quot; was decommissioned 26 June 1970 and mothballed at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 July 1989. In 1991, she was designated a National Historic Landmark. The carrier was donated to the Aircraft Carrier Hornet Foundation on 26 May 1998. On 17 October 1998, she was opened to the public as USS &quot;Hornet&quot; Museum in Alameda, California. She was designated a California State Historic Landmark in 1999, and is listed on the National Register of Historic places, #91002065.

Building on her status as an authentically restored aircraft carrier, &quot;Hornet&quot; has been featured in a number of film and television shows. Several TV shows have been recorded on board; and in 1997, she was the subject of an episode of the TV series &quot;JAG&quot;, the season-three opener titled &quot;Ghost Ship&quot;. In 2004, she was the set for scenes from the movie &quot;&quot;, which starred Ice Cube, and portions of the 2007 film &quot;Rescue Dawn&quot;, which starred Christian Bale, were shot on board. &quot;Hornet&quot; was both the subject and the setting of the independent film &quot;Carrier&quot; (2006). &quot;Hornet&quot; also hosted the final task and finish line of the thirtieth season of the reality show &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;.

&quot;Hornet&quot; also hosts CarrierCon, a fan convention for anime, video game, comic and cosplay fans. In 2023, CarrierCon collaborated with &quot;Azur Lane&quot;, a mobile game that features anthropomorphic &quot;shipgirls&quot; including &quot;Hornet&quot; herself (designated as Hornet II to distinguish her from her previous Yorktown-class version). Later that year, &quot;Hornet&quot; was chosen to host &quot;Azur Lane&quot;&#x27;s live event celebrating the 5th anniversary of its English/worldwide release.

<doc id="207239" wikidata="Q54054" url="?curid=207239" title="Władysław IV Vasa">
<text>Władysław IV Vasa or Ladislaus IV of Poland (9 June 1595 – 20 May 1648) was King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania and claimant of the thrones of Sweden and Russia. Born into the House of Vasa as a prince of Poland and of Sweden, Władysław IV was the eldest son of Sigismund III Vasa and Sigismund&#x27;s first wife, Anna of Austria.

Władysław was elected as the tsar of Russia by the Seven Boyars in 1610, when the Polish army captured Moscow, but did not assume the throne because of his father&#x27;s position and a popular uprising. Nevertheless, until 1634, he used the titular title of grand duke of Moscow. Following his election as king of Poland and grand duke of Lithuania in 1632, he was largely successful in defending the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth against foreign invasion, most notably in the Smolensk War of 1632–1634 in which he participated personally. 

He supported religious tolerance and carried out military reforms, such as the founding of the Commonwealth Navy. Władysław was also a renowned patron of the arts and music. He gained fame by defeating the Ottoman Empire, strengthening royal power, and reforming the Commonwealth&#x27;s political system, although he failed at reclaiming the Swedish throne. Despite that failure, his personal charisma and popularity among all segments of society contributed to relative internal calm in the Commonwealth.

He died without a legitimate son and was succeeded to the Polish-Lithuanian throne by his half-brother, John II Casimir Vasa. Władysław&#x27;s death marked the end of relative stability in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, as conflicts and tensions that had been growing over several decades came to a head with devastating consequences. The Khmelnytsky Uprising in the east (1648) and the subsequent Swedish invasion (&quot;the Deluge&quot;, 1655–1660) weakened the country and diminished Poland&#x27;s status as a regional power. For that reason, Władysław&#x27;s reign was seen in following decades as a bygone golden era of stability and prosperity.

==Life==
Władysław IV&#x27;s father, Sigismund III Vasa, grandson of Sweden&#x27;s King Gustav I, had succeeded his father to the Swedish throne in 1592, only to be deposed in 1599 by his uncle, subsequently King Charles IX. This resulted in a long-standing feud, with the Commonwealth&#x27;s kings of the House of Vasa claiming the Swedish throne. This led to the Polish–Swedish War of 1600–1629 and later to the Deluge of 1655.

===Childhood===

The marriage of Anne of Austria to Sigismund III was a traditional, politically motivated marriage, intended to tie the young House of Vasa to the prestigious Habsburgs. Władysław was born 9 June 1595 at the King&#x27;s summer residence in Łobzów, near Kraków, a few months after the main Wawel Castle had been consumed by fire.

Władysław&#x27;s mother died on 10 February 1598, less than three years after giving birth to him. He was raised by one of her former ladies of the court, Urszula Meierin, who eventually became a powerful player at the royal court, with much influence. 

Władysław&#x27;s Hofmeister was Michał Konarski, a Polish-Prussian noble. Around early 17th century Urszula lost much of her influence, as Władysław gained new teachers and mentors, including such priests
as Marek Łętkowski, Gabriel Prowancjusz, and Andrzej Szołdrski and in military matters by Zygmunt Kazanowski. 

Much of his curriculum was likely designed by Father Piotr Skarga, much respected by Sigmismund III. Władysław studied for several years in the Kraków Academy, and for two years, in Rome.

At the age of 10, he received his own prince court. He formed a friendship with brothers Adam and Stanisław Kazanowski. It was reported that young Władysław was interested in arts; later this led to him becoming an important patron of the arts. He spoke and wrote in German, Italian and Latin. 

Władysław was liked by the szlachta (Polish-Lithuanian nobility), but his father&#x27;s plans to secure him the Polish-Lithuanian throne (&quot;vivente rege&quot;) were unpopular and eventually crushed in the Zebrzydowski Rebellion (rokosz).

===Tsar===

With the intensification of the Polish intervention in Russia, in 1609, the royal family moved to their residence in Vilnius, capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, where he witnessed the fire of Vilnius, which required the royal family to evacuate from Vilnius Castle. Later that year, Władysław, aged 15, was elected as tsar by Russia&#x27;s aristocracy council of &quot;Seven boyars&quot;, who overthrew tsar Vasily Shuysky during the Time of Troubles. 

His election was ruined by his father, Sigismund, who aimed to convert Russia&#x27;s population from the Eastern Orthodox religion to Roman Catholicism. Sigismund refused to agree to the boyar&#x27;s request to send prince Władysław to Moscow and his conversion to Orthodoxy. Instead, Sigismund proposed that he should reign as a regent in Russia instead. This unrealistic proposal led to a resumption of hostilities. In 1611-12, silver and gold coins (kopecks) were prematurely stuck in the Russian mints in Moscow and Novgorod with Władysław&#x27;s titulary &quot;Tsar and Grand Prince Vladislav Zigimontovych of all Russia&quot;.

Władysław tried to regain the tsar&#x27;s throne himself, organizing a campaign in 1616. Despite some military victories, he was unable to capture Moscow. The Commonwealth gained some disputed territories in the Truce of Deulino, but Władysław was never able to reign in Russia; the throne during this time was instead held by tsar Michael Romanov. He held on to the title, without any real power, until 1634. 

Likely, the failure of this campaign showed Władysław the limits of royal power in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, as major factors for the failure included the significant autonomy of the military commanders, which did not see Władysław as their superior, and lack of funds for the army, as the Commonwealth&#x27;s parliament (sejm) refused to subsidize the war.

===Prince===
Before he was elected king of the Commonwealth, Władysław fought in many campaigns, seeking personal glory. After his final campaign against Russians in 1617–18 (the end of Dymitriads), he went to Silesia in 1619 looking for an opportunity to aid the Habsburgs in their struggle against the Czech Hussites in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, an opportunity that never materialized. 

In 1620, he took part in the second phase of the Polish–Ottoman War, a consequence of the long series of struggles between Poland and the Ottomans over Moldavia. In 1621, he was a Polish commander at Chocim. He reportedly he was stricken with illness but despite that proved a voice of reason, convincing other Polish commanders there to stay and fight. His advice was correct, and the battle eventually ended with a peace treaty that returned the status quo from before the Ottoman invasion. This peace treaty also gave Władysław an international reputation as a &quot;defender of the Christian faith&quot;, and increased his popularity in the Commonwealth itself.

In 1623, while near Gdańsk (Danzig), he witnessed Gustavus Adolphus&#x27;s Swedish Navy use its naval superiority to demand concessions from Gdańsk (the Commonwealth had no navy). 

In 1624, King Sigismund decided that the time had come for Władysław to travel, like many of his peers, to Western Europe. For security reasons, Władysław travelled under a fake name, Snopkowski (from Polish Snopek, meaning , as seen in the Vasa&#x27;s coat of arms). On the long voyage (1624–25), he was accompanied by Albrycht Stanisław Radziwiłł and other courtiers. 

First, he travelled to Wrocław (Breslau), then Munich, where he met Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria. In Brussels he met Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain; in Antwerp, Rubens. Near Breda he met Ambrosio Spinola. It was during his stay with Spinola that he was impressed by Western military techniques; this was later reflected when he became king, as military matters were always important to him. 

While not a military genius, and surpassed by his contemporary, Commonwealth hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski, Władysław was known as a fairly skilful commander on his own. In Rome he was welcomed by Pope Urban VIII, who congratulated him on his fighting against the Ottomans. During his stay in Florence he was impressed by opera, and decided to bring this form of art to the Commonwealth, where it was previously unknown. 

In Genoa and Venice he was impressed by the local shipyards, and in Pisa he witnessed a specially organized mock naval battle, experiences that resulted in his later attempt to create the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Navy.

After returning to Poland, he fought in 1626 against the Swedes in the last phase of the Polish–Swedish War, where he took part in the battle of Gniew. His involvement in this conflict, which lasted till the Truce of Altmark in 1629, was rather limited, and he spent much time in other parts of the country. 

During that period and afterwards, he lobbied for support for his candidature for the Polish-Lithuanian throne, as his father, Sigismund, was getting more advanced in his age, and the succession to the throne did not occur through inheritance but rather through the process of royal elections. While Władysław, and his father tried to ensure Władysław&#x27;s election during Sigismund&#x27;s lifetime, this was not a popular option for the nobility, and it repeatedly failed, up to and including at the sejm of 1631. 

Sigismund suffered a sudden stroke in late April 1632 and died in the morning hours of 30 April, forcing the matter to be raised again.

===King-Grand Duke===

The election sejm of 1632 eventually chose Władysław; there were no other serious contenders. The decision was reached on 8 November, but as the &quot;pacta conventa&quot; were not yet ready, the official announcement was delayed until 13 November. In the &quot;pacta conventa&quot;, Władysław pledged himself to fund a military school and equipment; to find a way to fund a navy; to maintain current alliances; not to raise armies, give offices or military ranks to foreigners, negotiate peace treaties, or declare war without the Sejm&#x27;s approval; not to take a wife without the Senate&#x27;s approval; to convince his brothers to take an oath to the Commonwealth; and to transfer the profits from the Royal Mint to the Royal Treasury rather than to a private treasury. When the election result was announced by the Crown Grand Marshal, Łukasz Opaliński, the &quot;szlachta&quot; (nobility), who had taken part in the election, began festivities in honor of the new king, which lasted three hours. Władysław was crowned in the Wawel Cathedral, in Kraków on 6 February in the following year.

====Military campaigns====
In an attempt to take advantage of the confusion expected after the death of the Commonwealth&#x27;s king, Tsar Michael I of Russia invaded the Commonwealth. A Muscovite army crossed Lithuania&#x27;s eastern frontier in October 1632 and laid siege to Smolensk (which was ceded to Lithuania by Russia in 1618, at the end of the Dymitriad wars). In the war against Russia in 1632–1634 (the Smolensk War), Władysław broke the siege in September 1633 and then in turn surrounded the Russian army under Mikhail Shein, which was then forced to surrender on 1 March 1634.

During that campaign Władysław started the modernisation program of the Commonwealth army, emphasising the usage of modern infantry and artillery. Władysław proved to be a good tactician, and his innovations in the use of artillery and fortifications based on Western ideas greatly contributed to the eventual Polish–Lithuanian success. King Władysław wanted to continue the war or, because the Polish–Swedish Treaty of Altmark would soon be expiring, ally with the Russians to strike against Sweden. However, the Sejm wanted no more conflict. As Stanisław Łubieński, the Bishop of Płock, wrote two weeks after Shein&#x27;s surrender: &quot;Our happiness is in remaining within our borders, guaranteeing health and well-being.&quot; The resulting Peace of Polyanov (Treaty of Polanów), favourable to Poland-Lithuania, confirmed the pre-war territorial &quot;status quo&quot;. Muscovy also agreed to pay 20,000 rubles in exchange for Wladyslaw&#x27;s renunciation of all claims to the tsardom and return of the royal insignia, which were in the Commonwealth possession since the Dymitriads.

Following the Smolensk campaign, the Commonwealth was threatened by another attack by the Ottoman Empire. During the wars against Ottomans in 1633–1634 Władysław moved the Commonwealth army south of the border with Russia, where under the command of the hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski it forced the Turks to renew a peace treaty. In the resulting treaty, both countries agreed again to curb the border raids by Cossacks and the Tatars, and the Ottomans confirmed that the Commonwealth to be an independent power, and had not to pay tribute to the Empire.

After the southern campaign, the Commonwealth had to deal with a threat from the north, as the armistice, ending the Polish–Swedish War (1600–1629) was expiring. The majority of Polish nobles preferred to solve the problem through negotiations, unwilling to pay taxes for a new war, provided that Sweden was open to negotiations and concessions (in particular, to retreat from the occupied Polish coastal territories). Władysław himself was hoping for a war, which could yield some more significant territorial gains, and even managed to gather a sizeable army, with navy elements, near the disputed territories. Sweden, weakened by involvement in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, was however open to a peaceful solution. Władysław could not go against the decision of the Sejm and Senate, and agreed to support the treaty. Thus both sides agreed to sign the Armistice of Stuhmsdorf (Sztumska Wieś) on 12 September 1635, favourable to the Commonwealth, which regained the Prussian territories, and called for a reduction of the Swedish tolls on the maritime trade.

====Politics====

In the three months between his election and coronation, Władysław sounded the waters regarding the possibility of a peaceful succession to the Swedish throne, following the recent death of Gustavus Adolphus, but this, as well as his proposal to mediate between Sweden and its enemies, was rejected, primarily by the Swedish chancellor and head of the regency council, Axel Oxenstierna.

Władysław IV owed nominal allegiance to the Imperial Habsburgs as a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece. His relationship with the Habsburgs was relatively strong; although he was not above carrying some negotiations with their enemies, like France, he refused Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s 1635 proposal of an alliance and a full-out war against them, despite the potential lure of territorial gains in Silesia. He realized that such a move would cause much unrest in a heavily Catholic Commonwealth, that he likely lacked the authority and power to push such a change of policy through the Sejm, and that the resulting conflict would be very difficult. From 1636 onward, for the next few years, Władysław strengthened his ties with the Habsburgs.

In the meantime, Władysław still tried to take a leading role in European politics, and negotiate a peaceful settlement to the Thirty Years&#x27; War, a settlement which he hoped would ease his way into regaining the Swedish crown. Following the armistice of Stuhmsdorf, Władysław came to increasingly realize that his prospects for regaining the Swedish throne were dim. In the years 1636–1638 he proposed several reforms to strengthen his and his dynasty&#x27;s power in the Commonwealth. His first plan was an attempt to secure a hereditary province within the country, which would not be threatened by the possible power shift following a future royal election; this, however, did not gain sufficient support in the Sejm. Next, Władysław attempted to create an order of chivalry, similar to the Order of the Golden Fleece, but this plan was scuttled down as well, with the szlachta and the magnates seeing this as an attempt to create a royal, loyalist elite, and traditionally opposing anything that could lead to the reduction of their extensive power. Popular vote and opposition also resulted in the failure of the plan to raise taxes from trade tariffs; here it was not only the nobility but even the merchants and burghers from towns, like Gdańsk (Danzig) who were able to muster enough support (including from foreign powers) to stop the king&#x27;s reforms. In fact, the defeat of his plans was so total, that he was forced to make certain conciliatory gestures to the nobility, as the Sejm passed several laws constraining his authority (such as to hire foreign troops), further indicating the limits of royal power in the Commonwealth.

====Marriages====
Early in his reign, there were plans regarding a marriage of Władysław and Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine (daughter of Frederick V, Elector Palatine). This was however unpopular, both with Catholic nobles and the Catholic Church, and when it became clear to Władysław that this would not convince the Swedes to elect him to their throne, this plan, with quiet support from Władysław himself, was dropped.

Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor&#x27;s proposal of marriage between Władysław and Archduchess Cecilia Renata of Austria (sister of future Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor) arrived in Warsaw somewhere during spring 1636. In June of that year, Władysław sent Jerzy Ossoliński to the Imperial Court, to work on improving the Imperial-Commonwealth relations. The king&#x27;s trusted confessor, father Walerian Magni (of Franciscan religious order), and voivode Kasper Doenhoff arrived in Regensburg () on 26 October 1636 with consent and performed negotiations. The Archduchess&#x27; dowry was agreed for 100,000 zlotys, the Emperor also promised to pay the dowries of both of Siegmund III&#x27;s wives: Anna and Konstance. Additionally the son of Władysław and Cecilia Renata was to obtain the duchy of Opole and Racibórz in Silesia (Duchy of Opole and Racibórz). However, before everything was confirmed and signed Ferdinand II died and Ferdinand III backed from giving the Silesian duchy to the son of Władysław. Instead a dowry was awarded to be secured by the Bohemian estates of Třeboň. On 16 March 1637 a &quot;family alliance&quot; was signed between the Habsburgs and the Polish-Lithuanian branch of the House of Vasa. Władysław promised not to sign any pacts against the Habsburgs, and to transfer his rights to the Swedish throne in case of his line&#x27;s extinction; in return, Habsburg promised to support his efforts to regain the Swedish crown, and to transfer to him some territory in case of gains in a war against the Ottomans. The marriage took place in 1637, on 12 September.

The next few years were similarly unsuccessful with regards to his plans. Eventually, he tried to bypass the opposition in the Sejm with secret alliances, dealings, and intrigues, but did not prove successful. Those plans included schemes such as supporting the Holy Roman Emperor&#x27;s raid on Inflanty in 1639, which he hoped would lead to a war; an attempted alliance with Spain against France in 1640–1641, and in 1641–1643, with Denmark against Sweden. On the international scene, he attempted to mediate between various religious factions of Christianity, using the tolerant image of the Commonwealth to portray himself as the neutral mediator. He organized a conference in Toruń (Thorn) that began on 28 January 1645, but it failed to reach any meaningful conclusions.

After Cecilia&#x27;s death in 1644, the ties between Władysław and the Habsburgs were somewhat loosened. In turn, the relations with France improved, and eventually Władysław married the French princess Ludwika Maria Gonzaga de Nevers, daughter of Charles I Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, in 1646.

Władysław&#x27;s last plan was to orchestrate a major war between the European powers and the Ottoman Empire. The border with the Empire was in a near-constant state of low-level warfare; some historians estimate that in the first half of the 17th century, Ottoman raids and wars resulted in the loss (death or enslavement) of about 300,000 Commonwealth citizens in the borderlands. The war, Władysław hoped, would also solve the problem of unrest among the Cossacks, a militant group living in Ukraine, near the Ottoman border, who could find worth in such a campaign, and turn their attention to fighting for the Commonwealth, instead of against it. As usual, he failed to inspire the nobility, rarely willing to consider sponsoring another war, to agree to this plan. He received more support from foreign powers, from Rome, Venice and Muscovy. With the promise of funds for the war, Władysław started recruiting troops among the Cossacks in 1646. The opposition of the Sejm, demanding that he dismiss the troops, coupled with Władysław&#x27;s worsening health, crippled that plan as well. Władysław still did not give up, and attempted to resurrect the plan in 1647, and with the support of magnate Jeremi Wiśniowiecki (who organized military exercises near Ottoman border), attempted unsuccessfully to provoke the Ottomans to attack.

On 9 August 1647, his young son, Sigismund Casimir, then seven years old, suddenly fell ill and died; the death of his only legitimate heir to the throne was a major blow to the king, whose grief prevented his attendance at the boy&#x27;s funeral held in Kraków.

====Death====
While hunting near Merkinė (Merecz) in early 1648, Władysław suffered from a case of gallstones or kidney stones. The King&#x27;s condition supposedly worsened as he was given the incorrect medication to treat the ailment. Being aware that these might be his final days, the King had his last will dictated and then received his last rites. Władysław died around 02:00 at night on 20 May 1648.

His heart and &quot;viscera&quot; were interred in the Chapel of St. Casimir of Vilnius Cathedral. As he had no legitimate male heirs, he was succeeded by his half-brother John II Casimir Vasa.

====Character====
Władysław has been described as outgoing and friendly, with a sense of humor, optimistic, a &quot;people&#x27;s person&quot;, able to charm many of those who interacted with him. On the other hand, he had a short temper and when angered, could act without considering all consequences.

Władysław was criticized for being a spendthrift; he lived lavishly, spending more than his royal court treasury could afford. He also dispensed much wealth among his courtiers, who were seen by people farther from the court as taking advantage of the king. He has also been known to maintain several mistresses throughout his life, including during his married period.

====Patronage====
One of the king&#x27;s most substantial achievements was in the cultural sphere; he became a notable patron of the arts. Władysław was a connoisseur of the arts, in particular, theater and music. He spoke several languages and enjoyed reading historical literature and poetry. He collected paintings and created a notable gallery of paintings in the Warsaw castle. Władysław assembled an important collection of Italian and Flemish Baroque paintings, much of which were lost in the wars after his death. He sponsored many musicians and in 1637 created the first amphitheater in the palace, the first theater in Poland, where during his reign dozens of operas and ballets were performed. He is credited with bringing the very genre of opera to Poland. Władysław&#x27;s attention to theater contributed to the spread of this art form in Poland. He was also interested in poetry, as well as in cartography and historical and scientific works; he corresponded with Galileo.

Notable painters and engravers Władysław supported and who attended his royal court included Peter Paul Rubens, Tommaso Dolabella, Peter Danckerts de Rij, Wilhelm Hondius, Bartłomiej Strobel, and Christian Melich. His royal orchestra was headed by kapellmeister Marco Scacchi, seconded by Bartłomiej Pękiel.

One of the most renowned works he ordered was the raising of the Sigismund&#x27;s Column in Warsaw. The column, dedicated to his father, was designed by the Italian-born architect Constantino Tencalla and the sculptor Clemente Molli, and cast by Daniel Tym. He was less interested in decorative architecture; he supported the construction of two palaces in Warsaw – Kazanowski Palace and &quot;Villa Regia&quot;. Among other works sponsored by or dedicated to him is Guido Reni&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of Europa&quot;.

== Assessment ==
Władysław had many plans (dynastic, about wars, territorial gains: regaining Silesia, Inflanty (Livonia), incorporation of Ducal Prussia, creation of his hereditary dukedom etc.), some of them with real chances of success, but for various reasons, most of them ended in failure during his 16-year reign. Though his grand international political plans failed, he did improve the Commonwealth foreign policy, supporting the establishment of a network of permanent diplomatic agents in important European countries.

Throughout his life, Władysław successfully defended the Commonwealth against foreign invasions. He was recognized as a good tactician and strategist, who did much to modernize the Commonwealth&#x27;s Army. Władysław ensured that the officer corps was significantly large so that the army could be expanded; introduced foreign (Western) infantry to the Polish Army, with its pikes and early firearms, and supported the expansion of the artillery. His attempt to create a Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Navy resulted in the creation of a new port village, Władysławowo. Despite promising beginnings, Władysław failed to secure enough funds for the fleet creation; the ships were gone – sunk, or stolen – by the 1640s.

The king, while Catholic, was very tolerant and did not support the more aggressive policies of the Counter-Reformation. When he took power, the Senate of Poland had 6 Protestant members; at the time of his death, it had 11. Despite his support for religious tolerance, he did fail, however, to resolve the conflict stemming from the Union of Brest split. Despite his support for the Protestants, he did not stop the growing tide of intolerance, either in Poland or abroad, as shown by the fate of the Racovian Academy, or an international disagreement between the faiths. Neither did he get involved with the disagreement about the Orthodox Cossacks, a group that he respected and counted on in his plans.

In internal politics he attempted to strengthen the power of the monarchy, but this was mostly thwarted by the szlachta, who valued their independence and democratic powers. Władysław suffered continuing difficulties caused by the efforts of the Commonwealth&#x27;s Sejm (parliament) to check the King&#x27;s power and limit his dynastic ambitions. Władysław was fed up with the weak position of the king in the Commonwealth; his politics included attempting to secure a small, preferably hereditary territory – like a duchy – where his position would be much stronger.

Władysław used the title of the King of Sweden, although he had no control over Sweden whatsoever and never set foot in that country. However, he continued his attempts to regain the Swedish throne, with a similar lack of results as his father. He might have been willing to trade his claim away, but the offer was never put down in the negotiations.

Some historians see Władysław as a dreamer who could not stick to one policy, and upon running into first difficulties, ditched it and looked for another opportunity. Perhaps it was due to this lukewarmness that Władysław was never able to inspire those he ruled to support, at least in any significant manner, any of his plans. Władysław Czapliński in his biography of the king is more understanding, noting the short period of his reign (16 years) and the weakness of the royal position he was forced to deal with.

Several years after his death, a diplomatic mission from Muscovy demanded that publications about Władysław&#x27;s victories in the Smolensk War of 1633–1634 be collected and burned. Eventually, to much controversy, their demand was met. Polish historian Maciej Rosalak noted: &quot;under the reign of Władysław IV, such a shameful event would have never been allowed.&quot;

==Royal titles==
* In Latin: &quot;Vladislaus Quartus Dei gratia rex Poloniae, magnus dux Lithuaniae, Russiae, Prussiae, Masoviae, Samogitiae, Livoniaeque, Smolenscie, Severiae, Czernichoviaeque necnon Suecorum, Gothorum Vandalorumque haereditarius rex, electus magnus dux Moschoviae.&quot;
* In English: &quot;Władysław IV, by grace of God the King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania, Ruthenia, Prussia, Masovia, Samogitia, Livonia, Smolensk, Severia and Chernigov and hereditary King of the Swedes, Goths and Vandals, elected Grand Duke of Moscow.

In 1632 Władysław was elected King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. He claimed to be King of Sweden by paternal inheritance, but was never able to gain possession of that throne. His titles were the longest of any Polish king ever.

==Notes==
a After some discussions early on, he chose the title of &quot;elected Grand Duke of Moscow&quot; (&quot;electus Magnus Dux Moscoviae&quot;) rather than that of a tsar.

b Władysław had no children with his second wife, and his first wife bore him only two children (Maria Anna Izabela and Zygmunt Kazimierz), both of them died in their youth. He had at least one known illegitimate son, Władysław Konstanty Vasa, but he played no significant role in Polish politics.

c The confusion stems from an undisambiguated use of the Polish medical term &quot;kamica&quot; in the cited reference work (Czapliński 1976). Czapliński also mentions that Władysław suffered from ill health throughout his life, related to obesity, rheumatism and kidney issues. There were months-long periods, particularly in 1635 and 1639, when he could not walk.

<text>Pianosa () is an island in the Tuscan Archipelago in the Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy. It is about in area, with a coastal perimeter of .

==Geography==
In Roman times, the island was named Planasia (plain) because of its flatness – its highest point stands at above sea level. It is a triangular-shaped land mass south-west of Elba and is a frazione of the municipality of Campo nell&#x27;Elba. 
Pianosa is the fifth biggest island of the Tuscan Archipelago and the only one to be formed out of sedimentary rock of the Neogene and Quaternary; such fossils as echinoderms, mollusca and bryozoa of the Pliocene are frequently found.

==Flora==
The vegetation consists mainly of Mediterranean species as lentisco, fennel, juniper, rosemary and &quot;Pinus halepensis&quot;, which was introduced on the island in the 1900s.

==Fauna== 
The animals living on the island are largely small mammals, such as hedgehog and hare, introduced in the 1800s, as well as the pheasant and the red-legged partridge; the magpie and the Audouin&#x27;s gull nest along the coast and are protected by the National Park. The island is a stopping place for migrating birds in their seasonal passage from North to South. The sea around Pianosa is rich in fish because the coast was unapproachable for a long time, while today National Park regulations forbid fishing. Grouper, dory, dentex, moray, crawfish and many other species of fish inhabit the seas around the island.
== History ==

The island was first inhabited in the Upper Palaeolithic, the Later Stone Age, but when in 5000 BC the sea level rose and reached the current level, the few inhabitants took refuge on the nearby Scola islet, where traces of their presence were found. Fishing tools and ceramics of the Mesolithic were found, as well as artefacts in quartz and flint, probably coming from Elba.
The ancient Romans&#x27; &quot;Planasia&quot; had structures and was extensively cultivated. It became noted in history when the &quot;princeps&quot; Augustus banished his grandson and former designated heir Agrippa Postumus there in 6 or 7 AD.
 Postumus remained there until his murder by an assassin sent by Tiberius, around 14 AD. Postumus lived in Pianosa at &quot;Villa Agrippa&quot;, which was discovered by abbot Gaetano Chierici in the second half of 1800s and included a theatre, a thermal bath (&quot;Bagni di Agrippa&quot;), and a Roman villa with black and white mosaic floors with marine-themed mythological decorations.

In the 4th century, a small Christian community lived in Pianosa and left traces of their presence in catacombs. These are on two levels and are the largest north of Rome; 700 catacombs were discovered, indicating a fair number of residents.

Pisa had custody of the island after a nearby naval battle victory in 874. In the Middle Ages the island&#x27;s ownership was disputed by Pisa and Genoa because of its strategic position. In 1238, Genoa sent troops to the island with the pretence that the inhabitants engaged in piracy. The troops destroyed the village and the fortifications built by the Pisans and took the 150 inhabitants prisoner. Pianosa was returned shortly afterward to Pisa, but Genoa had the supremacy of the Tyrrhenian Sea after the Battle of Meloria. The island returned to Pisan control under an agreement that required the Pisans to leave it uncultivated and uninhabited, but the pact was not honoured. The Appiano family, who ruled Pisa, leased the island to the De Leis family and then to the Landi family in 1344. The Appianos sold Pisa to Gian Galeazzo Visconti in 1399 and established the small Principality of Piombino, which included Suvereto, Scarlino, Vignale, Populonia and the islands of Elba, Montecristo and Pianosa. On August 15, 1552, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V of Spain consigned to Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici the Principality of Piombino in exchange of a loan of 200,000 scudi. 
Pianosa underwent numerous incursions by pirates; the worst took place in 1553, when a French Turkish fleet commanded by Dragut wiped out the population. After that, the island changed ownership several times and was populated only seasonally by farmers coming from Elba to cultivate the land. On 27 August 1802, Napoleon established that Elba, Capraia, Gorgona, Pianosa, Palmaiola and Montecristo were part of the French territory and in 1805 assigned the regions of Piombino, Elba, and the part of Pianosa that was fortified to his sister Elisa Bonaparte. On 9 April 1809, the Archipelago returned to Tuscan ownership, when Tuscany was ruled by the French. On 10 May, British marines and sailors from and HMS &quot;Halcyon&quot; landed on Pianosa and Giannutri. The landing parties destroyed the forts and captured about 100 prisoners during four hours of fighting. British losses were one marine killed and one wounded. The landing party also sent the farmers back to Elba and left the island deserted. Napoleon went to Pianosa from Elba twice, rebuilt the tower, set up a garrison to defend the island, and built some houses to settle farmers. The Congress of Vienna assigned Elba and the Tuscan Archipelago to the Grand Duke of Tuscany.

Although 18th-century documents report that it was once densely wooded, humans and the animals they brought have destroyed the trees on the island, which is now largely grassland except some coastal areas.
==Penal colony==
In 1856, Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany established a penal colony in Pianosa because it was considered a perfect place to isolate, segregate, and oversee detainees. At the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861, there were 149 prisoners on the island. In 1864 a structure able to contain 350 prisoners was built, but in 1872 the island was divided into numerous farms organizing the inmates as small communities. In 1880, there were 960 detainees. The captives cultivated cereals, produced oil and wine, such as Sangiovese and Procanico. There were poultry, pig, and cattle farms. From 1884 until 1965, because of its dry climate, Pianosa hosted convicts from the Italian mainland who had been affected by tuberculosis. At the beginning of the 1900s, the population on the island was 21 civilians, 80 prison guards, 40 soldiers, and 800 prisoners. Sandro Pertini, later President of the Republic of Italy, became an inmate in 1932 for political reasons. During World War II, on 17 September 1943, German troops invaded Pianosa and occupied it. On 19 March 1944, French commandos landed on the island and, after a short firefight, left with 40 prison guards as hostages. The following month, an Allied bomber attacked the island, killing six people.

In the post-war period, the colony returned to its original role as a prison island. A Carabinieri station was established, as was a detachment of Guardia di Finanza, and houses were built to accommodate the families of the soldiers. In the 1970s, on order of General Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, the former sanatorium, named Agrippa Branch, was transformed into a maximum security prison to confine Mafia bosses and terrorists of the Red Brigades: Giovanni Senzani, Renato Curcio, Alberto Franceschini, and Bruno Seghetti. Under the article 41-bis prison regime, in May 1977 aircraft and helicopters transferred 600 convicts from all over Italy to Pianosa in only two days.
A reinforced concrete wall, six metres high and long, was built in 1979 to separate the village from the penitentiary. The murder of judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992 led to the reopening of the Agrippa Branch under the 41-bis regime and during the night of July 20, fifty-five Mafia bosses incarcerated at Palermo Ucciardone prison, among them Michele Greco, were transferred by military transport aircraft to Pisa Airport and then to Pianosa by helicopter. 
The island was a prison fortress until 17 July 1997, when Gaetano Murana, the last 41-bis prison regime detainee, was transferred to another prison. Prior to that time Pianosa had hosted Mafia bosses such as Pippo Calò, Nitto Santapaola and Giovanni Brusca, and had become well known for the brutality inflicted on the prisoners.

The Prodi government decided to close the penitentiary permanently on 28 June 1998. Pianosa was evacuated in a single day by the remaining detainees and residents, leaving a few guards on the island as caretakers.

==Marine protected area==

Pianosa is part of the Arcipelago Toscano National Park, which has been a marine protected area since 1996 to preserve its archaeological and environmental heritage, which had been preserved in the past due to its inaccessibility to tourism.

The island permits visits by only 250 tourists per day, arriving by ferry from the Island of Elba. Fishing, diving, or anchoring are not allowed without a special authorization. During the summer season Pianosa can be reached once a week from Rio Marina and Piombino on the Toremar fleet, twice a week from San Vincenzo and daily from Marina di Campo on the service. It is possible to visit the island, but only with organized excursions or trekking by bicycle escorted by park guides.

==In popular culture==
Joseph Heller&#x27;s absurdist anti-war novel &quot;Catch-22&quot; is set mostly on Pianosa, at a fictional United States Army Air Forces bomber base during World War II. Heller notes at the beginning of &quot;Catch-22&quot; that the real Pianosa is too small to &quot;accommodate all the actions described.&quot; One obvious difference is that Heller&#x27;s &quot;Pianosa&quot; has a small community of Italian villagers, unlike the real island. Heller had been stationed on Corsica between May 1944 and December 1944, and flew 60 combat missions in B-25 Mitchell bombers as a bombardier with the 488th Bombardment Squadron (340th Bombardment Group, 57th Bombardment Wing, 12th Air Force).

The island also serves as a secondary setting in &quot;The Longest Exile&quot; (2024), a 1st century CE historical fiction novel by Tana Rebellis which primarily focuses on the exiled Julia the Younger, but which also includes the character of Agrippa Postumus on Pianosa.

<text>John II Casimir Vasa (; ; 22 March 1609 – 16 December 1672) was King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1648 to his abdication in 1668 as well as a claimant to the throne of Sweden from 1648 to 1660. He was the first son of Sigismund III Vasa with his second wife Constance of Austria. John Casimir succeeded his older half-brother, Władysław IV Vasa.

As a prince, John Casimir embarked at Genoa for Spain in 1638 to negotiate a league with Philip IV against France, but was captured by Cardinal Richelieu and imprisoned at Vincennes where he remained for two years. He was released when his brother, Władysław IV, promised never to wage war against France. John Casimir then travelled extensively throughout western Europe and entered the order of Jesuits in Rome in 1643. He was made cardinal by Innocent X, but after returning to Poland, he became a layman and succeeded his brother in 1648. His reign commenced amid the confusion and disasters caused by the great revolt of the Cossacks under Bohdan Khmelnytsky in Ukraine, who had advanced into the very heart of Poland. The power of the king had been stripped of almost all its prerogatives by the growing influence of the nobles.

The Tsardom of Russia and Sweden, which had long been active enemies of Poland, renewed their attacks. George II Rakoczy of Transylvania also invaded the Polish territory, and the Sejm was continuously dissolved because of the abuse of the &quot;liberum veto&quot; law. Charles X Gustav of Sweden triumphantly marched through the country and occupied Kraków in 1655, which forced John Casimir to flee to Silesia. The Swedes were eventually stopped by Stefan Czarniecki under Częstochowa. The wars against the Swedes and the Russians were terminated by treaties involving considerable cessions of provinces on the Baltic and the Dnieper on the part of Poland, which also lost its sway over the Cossacks, who placed themselves under the protection of Russian Tsars. During the long battles, John Casimir, though feeble and of a peaceful disposition, frequently proved his patriotism and courage.

The intrigues of his wife for the Duke of Enghien as successor to the Polish throne triggered a series of revolts, including a rebellion under Hetman Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski. As a result, John Casimir abdicated at the Sejm of Warsaw on 16 September 1668. The following year, he retired to France where he was hospitably treated by Louis XIV. John Casimir&#x27;s reign was one of the most disastrous in the history of Poland. He was the third and last monarch on the Polish throne from the House of Vasa.

==Biography==

===Early life, family and rise to power===

John Casimir was born in Kraków on 22 March 1609, the son of Sigismund III Vasa and Constance of Austria. His father, Sigismund III, the grandson of Gustav I of Sweden, had in 1592 succeeded his own father to the Swedish throne, only to be deposed in 1599 by his uncle, Charles IX of Sweden. This led to a long-standing feud wherein the Polish kings of the House of Vasa claimed the Swedish throne, resulting in the Polish–Swedish War of 1600–1629. Poland and Sweden were also on opposite sides in the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), although in that conflict Poland for the most part avoided joining any major military actions and campaigns, instead supporting the Austrian Habsburg and Catholic fraction. 

John Casimir for most of his life remained in the shadow of his older half-brother, Władysław IV Vasa. He had few friends among the Polish nobility. Unfriendly, secretive, dividing his time between lavish partying and religious contemplation, and disliking politics, he did not have a strong power base nor influence at the Polish court, instead supporting unfavorable Habsburg policies. He did, however, display talent as a military commander, showing his abilities in the Smolensk War against Muscovy (1633).

Between 1632 and 1635, Władysław IV sought to enhance his brother&#x27;s influence by negotiating a marriage for John Casimir to Christina of Sweden, then to an Italian princess, but to no avail. In 1637 John Casimir undertook a diplomatic mission to Vienna, which he abandoned to join the army of the Holy Roman Empire and fight against the French. After his regiment was defeated in battle, he spent a year living lavishly at the Viennese court where his strong anti-Cossack interests and political views were greatly shaped under the direct influence of the Austrian Emperor.

In 1636 he returned to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and fell in love with Baroness Guldentern, but his desire to marry her was thwarted by King Władysław. In return, Władysław attempted to make him the sovereign of the Duchy of Courland, but this was vetoed by the Commonwealth parliament (&quot;Sejm&quot;). Taking offence at this, John Casimir in 1638 left for the Kingdom of Spain to become Viceroy of Portugal, but was captured by French agents and imprisoned by the order of Cardinal Richelieu until 1640. He was then freed by a diplomatic mission of the appointed Voivode of Smolensk Krzysztof Gosiewski and as a result of anti-French Polish-Spanish negotiations.

In 1641 John Casimir decided to become a Jesuit. In 1642 he again left the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, accompanying his sister to Germany. In 1643 he joined the Jesuits, against vocal opposition from King Władysław, causing a diplomatic rift between the Commonwealth and the Pope. John Casimir went to Rome when the Jesuits invited him in order to bolster the Catholic faction. From this, he was appointed cardinal, but he would soon resign and return to the Commonwealth when the only son of Władysław died. He attempted to gain the support of the Habsburgs and marry an Austrian princess to create an alliance between the nations in case of an unexpected attack, possibly from the east.

===King of Poland===

In 1648 John Casimir was elected by the Polish Parliament to succeed his half-brother on the Polish throne. The reign of the last of the Vasas in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth would be dominated by the Russo-Polish War (1654–67), followed by the war with Sweden (&quot;The Deluge&quot;), the scene for which had been set by the Commonwealth&#x27;s two previous Vasa kings. Most of Poland was invaded by the Swedish army during The Deluge without much of a fight, due to the conspiratorial complicity of Polish and Lithuanian governors and nobility. In the course of a few years, the Commonwealth rose to force the Swedes out of Poland, ending the short-lived intrusions and campaigns, however, at a high cost. Most of the cities and towns in the Commonwealth were sacked, plundered and some were burnt to the ground, mostly by the retreating enemy units. Although the reign of John Casimir is remembered to be one of the most disastrous and perhaps most unsuccessful in the history of Poland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, he is often referred to as the &quot;warrior king&quot; that fought bravely to save his nation and his people.

In 1660 John II Casimir was forced to renounce his claim to the Swedish throne and acknowledge Swedish sovereignty over Livonia and the city of Riga in modern-day Latvia.

John Casimir had married his brother&#x27;s widow, Marie Louise Gonzaga (), who was a major support to the King. Marie Louise suddenly died in 1667 and this may have caused the monarch&#x27;s early political decline.

=== Abdication and death ===
On 16 September 1668, grief-stricken after the death of his wife in the previous year, John II Casimir abdicated the throne of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and returned to France, where he rejoined the Jesuits and became abbot of Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris. Following his abdication Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki (Michael I) was elected the new king and was crowned on 29 September 1669.

In the autumn of 1672, John Casimir had intended to return to Poland, but fell ill before departing and was prevented from doing so. The seizure of Kamieniec Podolski by the Ottoman Empire distressed him, exacerbating his condition. He requested the assistance of Pope Clement X to defend Poland against the Ottomans. He died on 16 December 1672 from apoplexy, and his burial took place inside the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków. His heart was interred in the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés.

==The Lwów Oath==
On 1 April 1656, during a Mass in the Latin Cathedral in Lwów, conducted by the papal legate Pietro Vidoni, John II Casimir in a grandiose and elaborate ceremony entrusted the Commonwealth under the protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary, whom he announced as &quot;The Queen of the Polish Crown and other of his countries&quot;. He also swore to &quot;protect the Kingdom&#x27;s folk from any impositions and unjust bondage&quot;. This is referred to as the Lwów Oath.

As almost the whole country was occupied by Swedish or Russian armies, the vow was intended to incite the whole nation, including the peasantry, to rise up against the invaders. Two main issues raised by the king in the vows were the necessity to protect the Catholic faith, seen as endangered by the Lutheran (and to some extent Orthodox) aggressors, and to manifest the will to improve the condition of the peasantry.

After the King, a similar vow was taken by the Deputy Chancellor of the Crown and the bishop of Kraków, Andrzej Trzebicki, in the name of the szlachta noblemen of the Commonwealth.

The Commonwealth forces finally drove back the Swedes in 1657 and the Russians in 1661. After the war, promises made by John Casimir in Lwów, especially those considering the peasants&#x27; lot, were not fulfilled, mostly because of objections by the Sejm, which represented the szlachta nobility and was not attracted to the idea of reducing serfdom, which would negatively affect their economic interests.

==Legacy==

John Casimir left no surviving children. All his brothers and sisters having predeceased him without surviving issue, he was the last of the line of Bona Sforza. With him, all the legitimate issue of Alfonso II of Naples died out. His heir in Ferdinand I of Naples and in the Brienne succession was his distant cousin, Henry de La Tremoille, Prince of Talmond and Taranto, the heir-general of Frederick IV of Naples (second son of Ferdinand I of Naples and Isabella of Clermont), who also was the heir-general of Federigo&#x27;s first wife, Anne of Savoy.

John Casimir was, after his brother, the head of the genealogical line of St. Bridget of Sweden, descending in primogeniture from Bridget&#x27;s sister. After his death, the headship was offered to his second cousin, the already-abdicated Christina I of Sweden.

==Patron of the arts==

The vast collection of paintings, portraits, porcelain and other valuables belonging to the Polish Vasas was mostly looted by the Swedes and Germans of Brandenburg who brutally sacked Warsaw in the 1650s, during the Deluge. Most of them were sold off to wealthy nobles, displayed in other parts of Europe, or would eventually belong to private collectors, though some of the famous works survived hidden in Opole like &quot;The Rape of Europa&quot; by Guido Reni.

The most important additions to the royal collection were made by John II Casimir, a passionate collector of Dutch paintings, and a patron of Daniel Schultz (who painted a famous portrait of a son of Crimean Aga Dedesh, and was made Royal falconer in reward for his father&#x27;s contribution during the war with Russia in 1663). A major part of the king&#x27;s painting collection was acquired in 1660s, by way of Hendrick van Uylenburgh, an agent in Amsterdam, and later his son Gerrit van Uylenburgh. These were mainly Dutch paintings and works by Rembrandt. The collection also included works by Rubens, Jordaens, Reni, Guercino, Jan Brueghel the Younger, and Bassano, among others.

When John Casimir abdicated the Polish–Lithuanian throne, he brought many of his paintings and portraits with him to France. The collection remaining at Royal Castle in Warsaw was looted during the Great Northern War or appropriated in 1720 by Augustus II the Strong, Elector of Saxony, like two paintings by Rembrandt – &quot;Portrait of a Rabbi&quot; (1657) and &quot;Portrait of a Man in the Hat Decorated with Pearls&quot; (1667), today displayed in the in Dresden, Germany.

==In fiction==
John Casimir was a character in Henryk Sienkiewicz&#x27;s novels &quot;With Fire and Sword&quot; (Ogniem i Mieczem) and &quot;The Deluge&quot; (Potop).

<text>USS &quot;Dolphin&quot; (AGSS-555) was a United States Navy diesel-electric deep-diving research and development submarine. She was commissioned in 1968 and decommissioned in 2007. Her 38-year career was the longest in history for a US Navy submarine to that point. She was the Navy&#x27;s last operational conventionally powered submarine.

==Construction and service==
&quot;Dolphin&quot; was designed under project SCB 207. Her keel was laid on 9 November 1962 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard, Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 8 June 1968, sponsored by Mrs. Maggie Shinobu Inouye, (née Awamura), wife of U.S. Senator Daniel K. Inouye, and commissioned on 17 August 1968 with Lieutenant Commander J.R. McDonnell in command.

&quot;Dolphin&quot;″s hull number, &quot;555&quot;, is unusual in that it was taken out of sequence. At the time of her 1968 commissioning, the five other new submarines commissioned that year, all of the , had hull numbers ranging from 638 to 663. &quot;Dolphin&quot;″s hull number was taken from a block of cancelled hull numbers from the World War II-vintage , the last of which was commissioned in 1951. The reason for the selection of &quot;555&quot; as &quot;Dolphin&quot;″s hull number is not known.

Despite a recent repair and upgrade, &quot;Dolphin&quot; was decommissioned on 15 January 2007 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on the same date. She is now a museum ship in San Diego Bay under the management of the San Diego Maritime Museum.

==Design==
The single most significant technical achievement in the development of &quot;Dolphin&quot; is the pressure hull itself. It is a constant-diameter cylinder, closed at its ends with hemispherical heads, and uses deep frames instead of bulkheads. The entire design of the pressure hull was kept as simple as possible to facilitate its use in structural experiments and trials. Hull openings were minimized for structural strength and minimum hull weight, in addition to eliminating possible sources for flooding casualties. The submarine has no snorkel mast; the main hatch had to be open when the diesel engines were running.

==Use==
Employed in both civilian and Navy activities, &quot;Dolphin&quot; was equipped with an extensive instrumentation suite that supported missions such as acoustic deep-water and littoral research, near-bottom and ocean surveys, weapons launches, sensor trials, and engineering evaluations. Because she was designed as a test platform, &quot;Dolphin&quot; could be modified both internally and externally to allow installation of up to 12 tons of special research and test equipment. She has internal and external mounting points, multiple electronic hull connectors, and up to 10 equipment racks for project use.

==Service record==
In August 1969, &quot;Dolphin&quot; launched a torpedo from the deepest depth that one has ever been fired. Other examples of &quot;Dolphin&quot;″s work include:
* first successful submarine-to-aircraft optical communications
* development of a laser imaging system of photographic clarity
* development of an extreme low frequency antenna for s
* evaluation of various nonacoustic ASW techniques
* evaluation of various low probability of interception active sonars
* first submarine launch of a mobile submarine simulator system
* first successful submarine test of BQS-15 sonar system
* development of highly accurate (10 cm) towed body position monitoring system
* development of a new obstacle-avoidance sonar system
* development of a highly accurate target management system
* evaluation of a possible &quot;fifth force of nature&quot;
* first successful submarine-to-aircraft two-way laser communication
* deepest submarine (i.e. [non-submersible) dive; more than 

&quot;Dolphin&quot; was overhauled in 1993. In the late 1990s, &quot;Dolphin&quot; tested a new sonar system. As a result of &quot;Dolphin&quot;″s efforts, this new system will now be retrofitted into the fleet.

===Fire and evacuation at sea===
On 21 May 2002, around 23:30 PDT, while operating roughly off the coast of San Diego, California, &quot;Dolphin&quot; was cruising on the surface, recharging her batteries, when a torpedo shield door gasket failed, and the boat began to flood. Due to high winds and swells in the ocean, around 75 tons of seawater entered the ship, an amount perilously close to the boat&#x27;s reserve buoyancy. The flooding shorted electrical panels and started fires.

Chief Machinist&#x27;s Mate (SS) John D. Wise, Jr., dove into the water of the flooded pump room. With less than a foot of breathable space in the compartment, he ensured the seawater valves were lined up, allowing pumping out to commence. Once the valves were aligned, he remained in the pump room for more than 90 minutes to keep a submersible pump from becoming clogged. His courageous efforts prevented the loss of the ship and crew. Wise received the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his efforts.

After 90 minutes, with fire and flooding beyond the ability of the crew to control, Commander Stephen Kelety, &quot;Dolphin&quot;″s commanding officer, ordered the crew of 41 and two civilian Navy employees to abandon ship. The Oceanographic Research ship was operating in the vicinity, and immediately responded to Kelety&#x27;s call for assistance. They were evacuated by boat to &quot;William McGaw&quot; after the hatches had been secured. All crewmembers were safely recovered with only a few minor injuries. Two were recovered from the water by United States Coast Guard helicopter during the transfer. &quot;William McGaw&quot; transported the crew to San Diego. also came alongside &quot;Dolphin&quot; and rescued several crewman from the water, but the seas were too rough for full recovery or towing operations.

The quick response of the crew placed the submarine in a stable condition. Submarine Support Vessel got underway from San Diego early on 22 May to assist in recovery. &quot;Dolphin&quot; was towed back to San Diego the following day.

==Retirement==

&quot;Dolphin&quot; underwent three and a half years of repairs and upgrades at a cost of $50 million, then completed sea trials during the summer of 2005, and returned to her duties for one year.

In mid-2006, the Navy decided to retire &quot;Dolphin&quot;, citing the $18 million her operations cost annually. She was deactivated on 22 September 2006, and decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 January 2007.
&quot;Dolphin&quot; was officially transferred to the San Diego Maritime Museum in September 2008, to become the eighth vessel in their floating collection. She was opened to the public for the first time on 4 July 2009.

<doc id="207247" wikidata="Q130018" url="?curid=207247" title="Denali">
<text>Denali (), federally designated as Mount McKinley, is the highest mountain peak in North America, with a summit elevation of above sea level. It is the tallest mountain in the world from base to peak on land, measuring . With a topographic prominence of and a topographic isolation of , Denali is the third most prominent and third-most isolated peak on Earth, after Mount Everest and Aconcagua. Located in the Alaska Range in the interior of the U.S. state of Alaska, Denali is the centerpiece of Denali National Park and Preserve.

The Koyukon people who inhabit the area around the mountain have referred to the peak as &quot;Denali&quot; for centuries. In 1896, a gold prospector named it &quot;Mount McKinley&quot; in support of then-presidential candidate William McKinley, who later became the 25th president; McKinley&#x27;s name was the official name recognized by the federal government of the United States from 1917 until 2015. In August 2015, 40 years after Alaska had done so, the United States Department of the Interior under the Obama administration announced the change of the official name of the mountain to Denali. On January 24, 2025, the Department of the Interior under the Trump administration changed the mountain&#x27;s official name back to Mount McKinley.

In 1903, James Wickersham recorded the first attempt at climbing Denali, which was unsuccessful. In 1906, Frederick Cook claimed the first ascent, but this ascent is unverified and its legitimacy questioned. The first verifiable ascent to Denali&#x27;s summit was achieved on June 7, 1913, by climbers Hudson Stuck, Harry Karstens, Walter Harper, and Robert Tatum, who went by the South Summit. In 1951, Bradford Washburn pioneered the West Buttress route, considered to be the safest and easiest route, and therefore the most popular currently in use.

On September 2, 2015, the U.S. Geological Survey measured the mountain at high, 10 ft lower than the measured in 1952 using photogrammetry.

==Geology and features==
Denali is a granitic pluton, mostly pink quartz monzonite, lifted by tectonic pressure from the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American Plate; at the same time, the sedimentary material above and around the mountain was stripped away by erosion. The forces that lifted Denali also caused many deep earthquakes in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. The Pacific Plate is seismically active beneath Denali, a tectonic region that is known as the &quot;McKinley cluster&quot;.

=== Structural geology ===
The high topography of Denali is related to the complex structural relationships created by the right-lateral Denali Fault and Denali Fault Bend. The Denali Fault is caused by stresses created by the low-angle subduction of the Yakutat microplate underneath Alaska. The Denali Fault Bend is characterized as a gentle restraining bend. The Denali Fault Bend represents a curvature in the Denali Fault that is approximately 75 km long. This curvature creates what is known as a &quot;space problem&quot;. As the right-lateral movement along the Denali Fault continues, high compressional forces created at the fault bend essentially push the crust up in a vertical fashion. The longer the crust stays within the restraining bend, the higher the topography will be. Several active normal faults north of the restraining bend have recently been mapped with slip rates of approximately 2–6 mm/year. These normal faults help to accommodate the unusual curvature of the restraining bend.

=== Elevation ===
Denali has a summit elevation of above sea level, making it the highest peak in North America and the northernmost mountain above elevation in the world. Measured from base to peak at some , it is among the largest mountains situated entirely above sea level. Denali rises from a sloping plain with elevations from , for a base-to-peak height of . By comparison, Mount Everest rises from the Tibetan Plateau at a much higher base elevation. Base elevations for Everest range from on the south side to on the Tibetan Plateau, for a base-to-peak height in the range of . Denali&#x27;s base-to-peak height is little more than half the of the volcano Mauna Kea, which lies mostly under water.

===Geography of the mountain===
Denali has two significant summits: the South Summit is the higher one, while the North Summit has an elevation of and a prominence of approximately . The North Summit is sometimes counted as a separate peak (see e.g., fourteener) and sometimes not; it is rarely climbed, except by those doing routes on the north side of the massif.

Five large glaciers flow off the slopes of the mountain. The Peters Glacier lies on the northwest side of the massif, while the Muldrow Glacier falls from its northeast slopes. Just to the east of the Muldrow, and abutting the eastern side of the massif, is the Traleika Glacier. The Ruth Glacier lies to the southeast of the mountain, and the Kahiltna Glacier leads up to the southwest side of the mountain. With a length of , the Kahiltna Glacier is the longest glacier in the Alaska Range.

==Naming==

The Koyukon Athabaskans who inhabit the area around the mountain have for centuries referred to the peak as or . The name is based on a Koyukon word for &#x27;high&#x27; or &#x27;tall&#x27;. During the Russian ownership of Alaska, the common name for the mountain was (; &#x27;big&#x27;; &#x27;mountain&#x27;), which is the Russian translation of &quot;Denali&quot;. It was briefly called Densmore&#x27;s Mountain in the late 1880s and early 1890s after Frank Densmore, a gold prospector who was the first non-native Alaskan to reach the base of the mountain.

In 1896, a gold prospector named it &quot;McKinley&quot; as political support for then-presidential candidate William McKinley, who became president the following year. The United States formally recognized the name Mount McKinley after President Woodrow Wilson signed the Mount McKinley National Park Act of February 26, 1917. In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson declared the north and south peaks of the mountain the &quot;Churchill Peaks&quot;, in honor of British statesman Winston Churchill. The Alaska Board of Geographic Names changed the name of the mountain to &quot;Denali&quot; in 1975, which was how it was referred to locally. However, a request in 1975 from the Alaska state legislature to the United States Board on Geographic Names to do the same at the federal level was blocked by Ohio congressman Ralph Regula, whose district included McKinley&#x27;s home town of Canton.

On August 30, 2015, just ahead of a presidential visit to Alaska, the Barack Obama administration announced the name &quot;Denali&quot; would be restored in line with the Alaska Geographic Board&#x27;s designation. U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell issued the order changing the name to Denali on August 28, 2015, effective immediately. Jewell said the change had been &quot;a long time coming&quot;. The renaming of the mountain received praise from Alaska&#x27;s senior U.S. senator, Republican Lisa Murkowski, who had previously introduced legislation to accomplish the name change, but it drew criticism from several politicians from President McKinley&#x27;s home state of Ohio, such as Governor John Kasich, U.S. Senator Rob Portman, U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, and Representative Bob Gibbs, who described Obama&#x27;s action as &quot;constitutional overreach&quot; because he said an act of Congress was required to rename the mountain. The &quot;Alaska Dispatch News&quot; reported that the secretary of the interior has authority under federal law to change geographic names when the Board of Geographic Names does not act on a naming request within a &quot;reasonable&quot; period of time. Jewell told the &quot;Alaska Dispatch News&quot; that &quot;I think any of us would think that 40 years is an unreasonable amount of time.&quot;

In December 2024, President-elect Donald Trump stated that he planned to revert the mountain&#x27;s official name back to Mount McKinley during his second term, in honor of President William McKinley. Trump had previously proposed changing the name in 2017, drawing opposition from Alaska&#x27;s Republican governor Mike Dunleavy. His 2017 proposal was strongly opposed by both Republican U.S. senators from Alaska, Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, who, along with Alaska State Senator Scott Kawasaki, a Democrat, again expressed their preference for Denali in 2024. On January 20, 2025, shortly after his second inauguration, Trump signed an executive order requiring the secretary of the interior to revert the Obama-era name change within 30 days of signing, renaming Denali back to Mount McKinley in official maps and communications from the American federal government. The executive order does not change the name of Denali National Park. On January 23, 2025, the Department of the Interior changed the mountain&#x27;s official name back to Mount McKinley. The same day, the Associated Press announced that it would use Mount McKinley instead of Denali, with the reasoning that as president, Trump has the authority to change federal geographical names of features lying within national borders.

According to the Alaska Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development&#x27;s official database of business licenses, businesses named after Denali outnumber those named after McKinley by a margin of six to one.

Indigenous names for Denali can be found in seven different Alaskan languages. The names fall into two categories. To the south of the Alaska Range in the Dena&#x27;ina and Ahtna languages the mountain is known by names that are translated as &#x27;big mountain&#x27;. To the north of the Alaska Range in the Lower Tanana, Koyukon, Upper Kuskokwim, Holikachuk, and Deg Xinag languages the mountain is known by names that are translated as &#x27;the high one&#x27;, &#x27;the tall one&#x27; (Koyukon, Lower and Middle Tanana, Upper Kuskokwim, Deg Xinag, and Holikachuk).

Asked about the importance of the mountain and its name, Will Mayo, former president of the Tanana Chiefs Conference, an organization that represents 42 Athabaskan tribes in the Alaskan interior, said: &quot;It&#x27;s not one homogeneous belief structure around the mountain, but we all agree that we&#x27;re all deeply gratified by the acknowledgment of the importance of Denali to Alaska&#x27;s people.&quot;

The following table lists the Alaskan Athabascan names for Denali.
==History==
The Koyukon Athabaskans, living in the Yukon, Tanana and Kuskokwim basins, were the first Native Americans with access to the flanks of the mountain. A British naval captain and explorer, George Vancouver, is the first European on record to have sighted Denali, when he noted &quot;distant stupendous mountains&quot; while surveying the Knik Arm of the Cook Inlet on May 6, 1794. The Russian explorer Lavrenty Zagoskin explored the Tanana and Kuskokwim rivers in 1843 and 1844, and was likely the first European to sight the mountain from the other side.

William Dickey, a New Hampshire-born resident of Seattle, Washington who had been digging for gold in the sands of the Susitna River, wrote, after his returning from Alaska, an account in the &quot;New York Sun&quot; that appeared on January 24, 1897. His report drew attention with the sentence &quot;We have no doubt that this peak is the highest in North America, and estimate that it is over high.&quot; Until then, Mount Logan in Canada&#x27;s Yukon Territory was believed to be the continent&#x27;s highest point. Though later praised for his estimate, Dickey admitted that other prospector parties had also guessed the mountain to be over . These estimates were confirmed in 1898 by the surveyor Robert Muldrow, who measured its elevation as .

On November 5, 2012, the United States Mint released a twenty-five cent piece depicting Denali National Park. It is the fifteenth of the America the Beautiful Quarters series. The reverse features a Dall sheep with the peak of Denali in the background.

===Climbing history===
During the summer of 1902 scientist Alfred Brooks explored the flanks of the mountain as a part of an exploratory surveying party conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey. The party landed at Cook Inlet in late May, then traveled east, paralleling the Alaska Range, before reaching the slopes of Denali in early August. Camped on the flank of the mountain on August 3, Brooks noted later that while &quot;the ascent of Mount McKinley had never been part of our plans&quot;, the party decided to delay one day so &quot;that we might actually set foot on the slopes of the mountain&quot;. Setting off alone, with good weather, on August 4, Brooks aimed to reach a shoulder. At , Brooks found his way blocked by sheer ice and, after leaving a small cairn as a marker, descended. After the party&#x27;s return, Brooks co-authored a &quot;Plan For Climbing Mt McKinley&quot;, published in &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine in January 1903, with fellow party-member and topographer D. L. Raeburn, in which they suggested that future attempts at the summit should approach from the north, not the south. The report received substantial attention, and within a year, two climbing parties declared their intent to summit.

During the early summer of 1903, Judge James Wickersham, then of Eagle, Alaska, made the first recorded attempt to climb Denali, along with a party of four others. The group attempted to get as close to the mountain as possible via the Kantishna river by steamer, before offloading and following Chitsia Creek with a poling boat, mules and backpacks, a route suggested to them by Tanana Athabaskan people they met along the way. The party received further navigational assistance at Anotoktilon, an Athabaskan hunting camp, where residents gave the group detailed directions to reach the glaciers at the foot of Denali. On reaching the mountain, the mountaineers set up base camp on the lower portion of Peters Glacier. Aiming for the northwest buttress of Denali&#x27;s north peak, they attempted to ascend directly; however, crevasses, ice fall and the lack of a clear passage caused them to turn and attempt to follow a spur via Jeffery Glacier where they believed they could see a way to the summit. After a dangerous ascent, at around , Wickersham found that the route did not connect as it had appeared from below, instead discovering &quot;a tremendous precipice beyond which we cannot go. Our only line of further ascent would be to climb the vertical wall of the mountain at our left, and that is impossible.&quot; This wall, now known as the Wickersham Wall, juts upwards from the glacier to the north peak of Denali. Because of the route&#x27;s history of avalanche danger, it was not successfully climbed until 1963.

Later in the summer of 1903, Dr. Frederick Cook directed a team of five men on another attempt at the summit. Cook was already an experienced explorer and had been a party-member on successful arctic expeditions commanded both by Robert Peary and Roald Amundsen. Yet he struggled to obtain funding for his own expedition, eventually organizing it &quot;on a shoestring budget&quot; without any other experienced climbers. The party navigated up the Cook inlet and followed the path of the 1902 Brooks party towards Denali. Cook approached the mountain via the Peters Glacier, as Wickersham had done; however, he was able to overcome the ice fall that had caused the previous group to turn up the spur towards the Wickersham Wall. Despite avoiding this obstacle, on August 31, having reached an elevation of about on the northwest buttress of the north peak, the party found they had reached a dead end and could make no further progress. On the descent, the group completely circumnavigated the mountain, the first climbing party to do so. Although Cook&#x27;s 1903 expedition did not reach the summit, he received acclaim for the accomplishment, a trek in which he not only circled the entire mountain but also found, on the descent, an accessible pass northeast of the Muldrow Glacier following the headwaters of the Toklat and Chulitna rivers.

In 1906, Cook initiated another expedition to Denali with co-leader Herschel Parker, a Columbia University professor of electrical engineering with extensive mountaineering experience. Belmore Browne, an experienced climber and five other men comprised the rest of the group. Cook and Parker&#x27;s group spent most of the summer season exploring the southern and southeastern approaches to the mountain, eventually reaching a high point on Tokositna glacier, from the summit. During their explorations the party mapped out many of the tributaries and glaciers of the Susitna river along the mountain&#x27;s south flank. As the summer ended, the team retreated to the coast and began to disperse. In September 1906, Cook and a single party-member, horseman Robert Barrill, journeyed towards the summit again, in what Cook later described as &quot;a last desperate attempt&quot; in a telegram to his financial backers. Cook and Barrill spent 12 days in total on the attempt, and claimed to have reached the summit via the Ruth Glacier.

Upon hearing Cook&#x27;s claims, Parker and Browne were immediately suspicious. Browne later wrote that he knew Cook&#x27;s claims were lies, just as &quot;any New Yorker would know that no man could walk from the Brooklyn Bridge to Grant&#x27;s Tomb [a distance of eight miles] in ten minutes.&quot; In May 1907, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; published Cook&#x27;s account of the climb along with a photograph of what appeared to be Barrill standing on the summit. By 1909, Barrill had recanted at least part of his story about the climb, and others publicly questioned the account; however, Cook continued to assert his claim. The controversy continued for decades. In 1956, mountaineers Bradford Washburn and Walter Gonnason tried to settle the matter, with Gonnason attempting to follow Cook&#x27;s purported route to the summit. Washburn noted inconsistencies between Cook&#x27;s account of locations of glaciers and found a spot, at and southeast of the summit that appeared identical to the supposed summit image. Gonnason was not able to complete the climb, but because he was turned back by poor weather, felt that this did not definitely disprove Cook&#x27;s story. In 1998, historian Robert Bryce discovered an original and un-cropped version of the &quot;fake peak&quot; photograph of Barrill standing on the promontory. It showed a wider view of surrounding features, appearing to definitively discount Cook&#x27;s claim.

Given the skepticism concerning Cook&#x27;s story, interest in claiming the first ascent remained. Miners and other Alaskans living in Kantishna and Fairbanks wanted the honors to go to local men. In 1909, four Alaska residents – Tom Lloyd, Peter Anderson, Billy Taylor, and Charles McGonagall – set out from Fairbanks, Alaska during late December with supplies and dogs that were in part paid for by bettors in a Fairbanks tavern. By March 1910, the men had established a base camp near one of the sites where the Brooks party had been and pressed on from the north via the Muldrow glacier. Unlike some previous expeditions, they discovered a pass, since named McGonagall Pass, which allowed them to bypass the Wickersham Wall and access the higher reaches of the mountain. At roughly , Tom Lloyd, old and less physically fit than the others, stayed behind. According to their account, the remaining three men pioneered a route following Karstens Ridge around the Harper Icefall, then reached the upper basin before ascending to Pioneer Ridge. The three men carried a spruce pole. Around , Charles McGonagall, older and having exhausted himself carrying the spruce pole, remained behind. On April 3, 1910, Billy Taylor and Peter Anderson scrambled the final few hundred feet to reach the north peak of Denali, at high, the shorter of the two peaks. The pair erected the pole near the top, with the hope that it would be visible from lower reaches to prove they had made it.

After the expedition, Tom Lloyd returned to Fairbanks, while the three others remained in Kantishna to mine. In Lloyd&#x27;s recounting, all four men made it to the top of not only the north peak, but the higher south peak as well. When the remaining three men returned to town with conflicting accounts, the entire expedition&#x27;s legitimacy was questioned. Several years later, another climbing group would claim to have seen the spruce pole in the distance, supporting their north peak claim. However, some continue to doubt they reached the summit. Outside of the single later climbing group, who were friendly with some of the Sourdough expedition men, no other group would ever see it. Jon Waterman, author of the book &quot;Chasing Denali&quot;, which explored the controversy, outlined several reasons to doubt the claim: There was never any photographic evidence. The four men climbed during the winter season, known for much more difficult conditions, along a route that has never been fully replicated. They were inexperienced climbers, ascending without any of the usual safety gear or any care for altitude sickness. They claimed to have ascended from to the top in less than 18 hours, unheard of at a time when siege-style alpinism was the norm. Yet Waterman says &quot;these guys were men of the trail. They didn&#x27;t care what anybody thought. They were just tough SOBs.&quot; He noted that the men were largely unlettered and that some of the ensuing doubt was related to their lack of sophistication in dealing with the press and the contemporary climbing establishment.

In 1912, the Parker-Browne expedition nearly reached the summit, turning back within just a few hundred yards/meters of it due to harsh weather. On July 7, the day after their descent, a 7.4-magnitude earthquake shattered the glacier they had ascended.

The first ascent of the main summit of Denali came on June 7, 1913, by a party directed by Hudson Stuck and Harry Karstens, along with Walter Harper and Robert Tatum. Karstens relocated to Alaska in the gold rush of 1897, and in subsequent years became involved in a variety of endeavors beyond mining, including helping establish dog mushing routes to deliver mail across vast swathes of territory and supporting expeditions led by naturalist Charles Sheldon near the base of Denali. Stuck was an English-born Episcopal priest who came to Alaska by chance. He became acclimated to the often harsh Alaskan environment because of his many travels between far-flung outposts within his district, climbing mountains as a hobby. At 21 years old, Harper was already known as a skilled and strong outdoorsman, the Alaska-born son of a Koyukon-Athabascan mother and Irish gold prospector father. Tatum, also 21 years old, was a theology student working at a Tanana mission, and the least experienced of the team. His primary responsibility on the trip was as a cook.

The team approached the peak from the north via the Muldrow glacier and McGonagall pass. While ferrying loads up to a camp at around , they suffered a setback when a stray match accidentally set fire to some supplies, including several tents. The prior year&#x27;s earthquake had left what had previously been described by the Parker-Browne expedition as a gentle slope ascended in no more than three days as a dangerous, ice-strewn morass on a knife-edged ridge (later named Karstens ridge). It would take the team three weeks to cover the same ground, as Karstens and Harper laboriously cut steps into the ice. On May 30, the team, with the help of some good weather, ascended to a new high camp, situated at in the Grand Basin between the north and south peaks. On June 7, the team made the summit attempt. Temperatures were below at times. Every man, and particularly Stuck, suffered from altitude sickness. By midday, Harper became the first climber to reach the summit, followed seconds later by Tatum and Karstens. Stuck arrived last, falling unconscious on the summit.

Using the mountain&#x27;s contemporary name, Tatum later commented, &quot;The view from the top of Mount McKinley is like looking out the windows of Heaven!&quot; During the climb, Stuck spotted, via binoculars, the presence of a large pole near the North Summit; this report confirmed the Sourdough ascent, and it is widely believed presently that the Sourdoughs did succeed on the North Summit. However, the pole was never seen before or since, so there is still some doubt. Stuck also discovered that the Parker-Browne party were only about of elevation short of the true summit when they turned back. Stuck and Karstens&#x27; team achieved the uncontroversial first ascent of Denali&#x27;s south peak; however, the news was met with muted interest by the wider climbing community. &quot;Appalachia Journal&quot;, then the official journal of the American Alpine Club, published a small notice of the accomplishment a year later.

The mountain is climbed regularly nowadays. In 2003, around 58% of climbers reached the top. But by that time, the mountain had claimed the lives of nearly 100 mountaineers. The vast majority of climbers use the West Buttress Route, pioneered in 1951 by Bradford Washburn, after an extensive aerial photographic analysis of the mountain. Climbers typically take two to four weeks to ascend Denali. It is one of the Seven Summits; summiting all of them is a challenge for mountaineers.

===Accidents===

From 1947 to 2018 in the United States &quot;2,799 people were reported to be involved in mountaineering accidents&quot; and 11% of these accidents occurred on Denali. Of these 2,799 accidents, 43% resulted in death and 8% of these deaths occurred on Denali.

* 1995: French skiers Jean-Noel Urban and Nicolas Bonhomme, made the first ski descent down the Wickersham Wall, most of the face was 50°. 
* 1997: First successful ascent up the West Fork of Traleika Glacier up to Karstens Ridge beneath Browne Tower. This path was named the &quot;Butte Direct&quot; by the two climbers Jim Wilson and Jim Blow.
* 2015: On June 24, a survey team led by Blaine Horner placed two global positioning receivers on the summit to determine the precise position and elevation of the summit. The summit snow depth was measured at . The United States National Geodetic Survey later determined the summit elevation to be .
*2019: On June 20, Karl Egloff (Swiss-Ecuadorian) set new speed records for the ascent (7h 40m) and round-trip (11h 44m), starting and returning to a base camp at on the Kahiltna Glacier.

==Weather station==

The Japanese Alpine Club installed a meteorological station on a ridge near the summit of Denali at an elevation of in 1990. In 1998, this weather station was donated to the International Arctic Research Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. In June 2002, a weather station was placed at the level. This weather station was designed to transmit data in real-time for use by the climbing public and the science community. Since its establishment, annual upgrades to the equipment have been performed with instrumentation custom built for the extreme weather and altitude conditions. This weather station is the third-highest weather station in the world.

The weather station recorded a temperature of on December 1, 2003. On the previous day of November 30, 2003, a temperature of combined with a wind speed of to produce a North American record windchill of .

Even in July, this weather station has recorded temperatures as low as and windchills as low as .

===Historical record===
According to the National Park Service, in 1932 the -Lindley expedition recovered a self-recording minimum thermometer left near Browne&#x27;s Tower, at about , on Denali by the Stuck-Karstens party in 1913. The spirit thermometer was calibrated down to , and the lowest recorded temperature was below that point. Harry J. Liek took the thermometer back to Washington, D.C. where it was tested by the United States Weather Bureau and found to be accurate. The lowest temperature that it had recorded was found to be approximately . Another thermometer was placed at the level by the U.S. Army Natick Laboratory, and was there from 1950 to 1969. The lowest temperature recorded during that period was also .

<text>Cuckoos are birds in the Cuculidae ( ) family, the sole taxon in the order Cuculiformes ( ). The cuckoo family includes the common or European cuckoo, roadrunners, koels, malkohas, couas, coucals, and anis. The coucals and anis are sometimes separated as distinct families, the Centropodidae and Crotophagidae, respectively. The cuckoo order Cuculiformes is one of three that make up the Otidimorphae, the other two being the turacos and the bustards. The family Cuculidae contains 150 species, which are divided into 33 genera.

The cuckoos are generally medium-sized, slender birds. Most species live in trees, though a sizeable minority are ground-dwelling. The family has a cosmopolitan distribution; the majority of species are tropical. Some species are migratory. The cuckoos feed on insects, insect larvae, and a variety of other animals, as well as fruit. Some species are brood parasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other species and giving rise to the terms &quot;cuckoo&#x27;s egg&quot; and &quot;cuckold&quot; as metaphors, but most species raise their own young.

Cuckoos have played a role in human culture for thousands of years, appearing in Greek mythology as sacred to the goddess Hera. In Europe, the cuckoo is associated with spring, and with cuckoldry, for example in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;. In India, cuckoos are sacred to Kamadeva, the god of desire and longing, whereas in Japan, the cuckoo symbolises unrequited love.

== Description ==

Cuckoos are medium-sized birds that range in size from the little bronze cuckoo, at and , to moderately large birds, ranging from in length, such as the giant coua of Madagascar, the coral-billed ground-cuckoo of Indochina, and various large Indo-Pacific coucals such as the goliath coucal of Halmahera, Timor coucal, buff-headed coucal, ivory-billed coucal, violaceous coucal, and larger forms of the pheasant coucal. The channel-billed cuckoo, at and is the largest parasitic cuckoo. Generally, little sexual dimorphism in size occurs, but where it exists, it can be either the male or the female that is larger. One of the most important distinguishing features of the family is the feet, which are zygodactyl, meaning that the two inner toes point forward and the two outer backward. The two basic body forms are arboreal species (such as the common cuckoo), which are slender and have short tarsi, and terrestrial species (such as the roadrunners), which are more heavy set and have long tarsi. Almost all species have long tails that are used for steering in terrestrial species and as a rudder during flight in the arboreal species. The wing shape also varies with lifestyle, with the more migratory species such as the black-billed cuckoo possessing long, narrow wings capable of strong, direct flight, and the more terrestrial and sedentary cuckoos such as the coucals and malkohas having shorter rounded wings and a more laboured, gliding flight.

The subfamily Cuculinae comprises the brood-parasitic cuckoos of the Old World. They tend to conform to the classic shape, with (usually) long tails, short legs, long, narrow wings, and an arboreal lifestyle. The largest species, the channel-billed cuckoo, also has the most outsized bill in the family, resembling that of a hornbill. The subfamily Phaenicophaeinae comprises the nonparasitic cuckoos of the Old World, and include the couas, malkohas, and ground cuckoos. They are more terrestrial cuckoos, with strong and often long legs and short, rounded wings. The subfamily typically has brighter plumage and brightly coloured bare skin around the eye. The coucals are another terrestrial Old World subfamily of long-tailed, long-legged, and short-winged cuckoos. They are large, heavyset birds with the largest, the greater black coucal, being around the same size as the channel-billed cuckoo. Genera of the subfamily Coccyzinae are arboreal and long-tailed, as well, with a number of large insular forms. The New World ground cuckoos are similar to the Asian ground-cuckoos in being long legged and terrestrial, and includes the long-billed roadrunner, which can reach speeds of when chasing prey. The final subfamily includes the atypical anis, which are the small, clumsy anis and the larger guira cuckoo. The anis have massive bills and smooth, glossy feathers.

The feathers of the cuckoos are generally soft, and often become waterlogged in heavy rain. Cuckoos often sun themselves after rain, and the anis hold their wings open in the manner of a vulture or cormorant while drying. Considerable variation in the plumage is exhibited by the family. Some species, particularly the brood parasites, have cryptic plumage, whereas others have bright and elaborate plumage. This is particularly true of the &quot;Chrysococcyx&quot; or glossy cuckoos, which have iridescent plumage. Some cuckoos have a resemblance to hawks in the genus &quot;Accipiter&quot; with barring on the underside; this apparently alarms potential hosts, allowing the female to access a host nest. The young of some brood parasites are coloured so as to resemble the young of the host. For example, the Asian koels breeding in India have black offspring to resemble their crow hosts, whereas in the Australian koels the chicks are brown like their honeyeater hosts. Sexual dimorphism in plumage is uncommon in the cuckoos, being most common in the parasitic Old World species. Cuckoos have 10 and 9–13 . All species have 10 , apart from the anis, which have eight.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The cuckoos have a cosmopolitan distribution, ranging across all the world&#x27;s continents except Antarctica. They are absent from the southwest of South America, the far north and northwest of North America, and the driest areas of the Middle East and North Africa (although they occur there as passage migrants). In the oceanic islands of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans they generally only occur as vagrants, but one species breeds on a number of Pacific islands and another is a winter migrant across much of the Pacific.

The Cuculinae are the most widespread subfamily of cuckoos, and are distributed across Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and Oceania. Amongst the Phaenicophaeinae, the malkohas and Asian ground cuckoos are restricted to southern Asia, the couas are endemic to Madagascar, and the yellowbill is widespread across Africa. The coucals are distributed from Africa through tropical Asia south into Australia and the Solomon Islands. The remaining three subfamilies have a New World distribution, all are found in both North and South America. The Coccyzinae reach the furthest north of the three subfamilies, breeding in Canada, whereas the anis reach as far north as Florida and the typical ground cuckoos are in the Southwest United States.

For the cuckoos, suitable habitat provides a source of food (principally insects and especially caterpillars) and a place to breed; for brood parasites the need is for suitable habitat for the host species. Cuckoos occur in a wide variety of habitats. The majority of species occur in forests and woodland, principally in the evergreen rainforests of the tropics, where they are typically but not exclusively arboreal. Some species inhabit or are even restricted to mangrove forests; these include the little bronze cuckoo of Australia, some malkohas, coucals, and the aptly named mangrove cuckoo of the New World. In addition to forests, some species of cuckoos occupy more open environments; this can include even arid areas such as deserts in the case of the greater roadrunner or the pallid cuckoo. Temperate migratory species, such as the common cuckoo, inhabit a wide range of habitats to make maximum use of the potential brood hosts, from reed beds (where they parasitise reed warblers) to treeless moors (where they parasitise meadow pipits).

=== Migration ===
Most species of cuckoo are sedentary, but some undertake regular seasonal migrations, and others undertake partial migrations over part of their range.

Species breeding at higher latitudes migrate to warmer climates during the winter due to food availability. The long-tailed koel, which breeds in New Zealand, flies to its wintering grounds in Polynesia, Micronesia, and Melanesia, a feat described as &quot;perhaps the most remarkable overwater migration of any land bird.&quot; The yellow-billed cuckoo and black-billed cuckoo breed in North America and fly across the Caribbean Sea, a nonstop flight of . Other long migration flights include the lesser cuckoo, which flies from Africa to India, and the common cuckoo of Europe, which flies nonstop over the Mediterranean Sea and Sahara Desert on the voyage between Europe and central Africa.

Within Africa, 10 species make regular intracontinental migrations that are described as polarised; that is, they spend the nonbreeding season in the tropical centre of the continent and move north and south to breed in the more arid and open savannah and deserts. This is the same as the situation in the Neotropics, where no species have this migration pattern, or tropical Asia, where a single species does. About 83% of the Australian species are partial migrants within Australia or travel to New Guinea and Indonesia after the breeding season.

In some species, the migration is diurnal, as in the channel-billed cuckoo, or nocturnal, as in the yellow-billed cuckoo.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

The cuckoos are, for the most part, solitary birds that seldom occur in pairs or groups. The biggest exception to this are the anis of the Americas, which have evolved cooperative breeding and other social behaviours. For the most part, the cuckoos are also diurnal as opposed to nocturnal, but many species call at night (see below). The cuckoos are also generally a shy and retiring family, more often heard than seen. The exception to this is again the anis, which are often extremely trusting towards humans and other species.

Most cuckoos are insectivores, and in particular are specialised in eating larger insects and caterpillars, including noxious, hairy types avoided by other birds. They are unusual among birds in processing their prey prior to swallowing, rubbing it back and forth on hard objects such as branches and then crushing it with special bony plates in the back of the mouth. They also take a wide range of other insects and animal prey. The lizard cuckoos of the Caribbean have, in the relative absence of birds of prey, specialised in taking lizards. Larger, ground types, such as coucals and roadrunners, also feed variously on snakes, lizards, small rodents, and other birds, which they bludgeon with their strong bills. Ground species may employ different techniques to catch prey. A study of two coua species in Madagascar found that Coquerel&#x27;s coua obtained prey by walking and gleaning on the forest floor, whereas the red-capped ca-ca ran and pounced on prey. Both species also showed seasonal flexibility in prey and foraging techniques. 

The parasitic cuckoos are generally not recorded as participating in mixed-species feeding flocks, although some studies in eastern Australia found several species participated in the nonbreeding season, but were mobbed and unable to do so in the breeding season. Ground cuckoos of the genus &quot;Neomorphus&quot; are sometimes seen feeding in association with army ant swarms, although they are not obligate ant followers, as are some antbirds. The anis are ground feeders that follow cattle and other large mammals when foraging; in a similar fashion to cattle egrets, they snatch prey flushed by the cattle, so enjoy higher foraging success rates in this way.

Several koels, couas, and the channel-billed cuckoo feed mainly on fruit, but they are not exclusively frugivores. The parasitic koels and channel-billed cuckoo in particular consume mainly fruit when raised by frugivore hosts such as the Australasian figbird and pied currawong. Other species occasionally take fruit, as well. Couas consume fruit in the dry season when prey is harder to find.

=== Breeding ===
The cuckoos are an extremely diverse group of birds with regards to breeding systems. Most are monogamous, but exceptions exist. The anis and the guira cuckoo lay their eggs in communal nests, which are built by all members of the group. Incubation, brooding, and territorial defence duties are shared by all members of the group. Within these species, the anis breed as groups of monogamous pairs, but the guira cuckoos are not monogamous within the group, exhibiting a polygynandrous breeding system. This group nesting behaviour is not completely cooperative; females compete and may remove others&#x27; eggs when laying theirs. Eggs are usually only ejected early in the breeding season in the anis, but can be ejected at any time by guria cuckoos. Polyandry has been confirmed in the African black coucal and is suspected to occur in the other coucals, perhaps explaining the reversed sexual dimorphism in the group.

Most cuckoo species, including malkohas, couas, coucals, and roadrunners, and most other American cuckoos, build their own nests, although a large minority engages in brood parasitism (see below). Most of these species nest in trees or bushes, but the coucals lay their eggs in nests on the ground or in low shrubs. Though on some occasions nonparasitic cuckoos parasitize other species, the parent still helps feed the chick.

The nests of cuckoos vary in the same way as the breeding systems. The nests of malkohas and Asian ground cuckoos are shallow platforms of twigs, but those of coucals are globular or domed nests of grasses. The New World cuckoos build saucers or bowls in the case of the New World ground cuckoos.

Nonparasitic cuckoos, like most other nonpasserines, lay white eggs, but many of the parasitic species lay coloured eggs to match those of their passerine hosts.

The young of all species are altricial. Nonparasitic cuckoos leave the nest before they can fly, and some New World species have the shortest incubation periods among birds.

==== Brood parasitism ====


About 56 of the Old World species and three of the New World cuckoo species (pheasant, pavonine, and striped) are brood parasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other birds and giving rise to the metaphor &quot;cuckoo&#x27;s egg&quot;. These species are obligate brood parasites, meaning that they only reproduce in this fashion. The best-known example is the European common cuckoo. In addition to the above noted species, others sometimes engage in nonobligate brood parasitism, laying their eggs in the nests of members of their own species, in addition to raising their own young. Brood parasitism has even been seen in greater roadrunners, where their eggs were seen in the nests of common ravens and northern mockingbirds. The shells of the eggs of brood-parasitic cuckoos are usually thicker and stronger than those of their hosts. This protects the egg if a host parent tries to damage it, and may make it resistant to cracking when dropped into a host nest. Cuckoo eggshells have two distinct layers. In some nesting cuckoos, a thick, outer, chalky layer is not present on the eggs of most brood-parasitic species, with some exceptions, and the eggshells of Old World parasitic cuckoos have a thick outer layer that is different from that of nesting cuckoos.

===== Parasitic cuckoo advanced laying and hatching =====
The cuckoo egg hatches earlier than the host eggs, and the cuckoo chick grows faster; in most cases, the chick evicts the eggs and/or young of the host species. The chick has no time to learn this behavior, nor does any parent stay around to teach it, so it must be an instinct passed on genetically.

One reason for the cuckoo egg&#x27;s hatching sooner is that, after the egg is fully formed, the female cuckoo holds it in her oviduct for another 24 hours prior to laying. This means that the egg has already had 24 hours of internal incubation. Furthermore, the cuckoo&#x27;s internal temperature is 3–4 °C higher than the temperature at which the egg is incubated in the nest, and the higher temperature means that the egg incubates faster, so at the time it is laid, the egg has already had the equivalent of 30 hours incubation in a nest.

The chick encourages the host to keep pace with its high growth rate with its rapid begging call and the chick&#x27;s open mouth which serves as a sign stimulus.

===== Evolutionary arms race between cuckoo and host =====
Since obligate brood parasites need to successfully trick their host for them to reproduce, they have evolved adaptations at several stages of breeding. High costs of parasitism are exerted on the host, leading to strong selections on the host to recognize and reject parasitic eggs. The adaptations and counter-adaptations between hosts and parasites have led to a coevolution &quot;arms race&quot;. This means that if one of the species involved were to stop adapting, it would lose the race to the other species, resulting in decreased fitness of the losing species. The egg-stage adaptation is the best studied stage of this arms race.

Cuckoos have various strategies for getting their eggs into host nests. Different species use different strategies based on host defensive strategies. Female cuckoos have secretive and fast laying behaviors, but in some cases, males have been shown to lure host adults away from their nests so that the females can lay their eggs in the nest. Some host species may directly try to prevent cuckoos laying eggs in their nest in the first place – birds whose nests are at high risk of cuckoo-contamination are known to &quot;mob&quot; attack cuckoos to drive them out of the area. Parasitic cuckoos are grouped into gentes, with each gens specializing in a particular host. Some evidence suggests that the gentes are genetically different from one another.

===== Host egg mimicry =====
Female parasitic cuckoos sometimes specialize and lay eggs that closely resemble the eggs of their chosen host. Some birds are able to distinguish cuckoo eggs from their own, leading to those eggs least like the host&#x27;s being thrown out of the nest. Parasitic cuckoos that show the highest levels of egg mimicry are those whose hosts exhibit high levels of egg rejection behavior. Some hosts do not exhibit egg rejection behavior and the cuckoo eggs look very dissimilar from the host eggs. It has also been shown in a study of the European common cuckoos that females lay their egg in the nest of a host that has eggs that look similar to its own. Other species of cuckoo lay &quot;cryptic&quot; eggs, which are dark in color when their hosts&#x27; eggs are light. This is a trick to hide the egg from the host, and is exhibited in cuckoos that parasitize hosts with dark, domed nests. Some adult parasitic cuckoos completely destroy the host&#x27;s clutch if they reject the cuckoo egg. In this case, raising the cuckoo chick is less of a cost than the alternative, total clutch destruction.

Cuckoo egg physiology can limit the degree of mimetic accuracy. Due to larger chick size on average for parasites compared to hosts, this is a physiological constraint on egg size, a minimum egg size needed to support a healthy cuckoo chick. In these cases, there is selective pressure on cuckoos to lessen their egg size to be a more effective mimic, but physiological constraints hinder the species from doing so.

Mimicry may also be imperfect due to a lack of strong selection pressures towards the parasite. Oriental reed warbler hosts do not discriminate between warbler-sized model eggs and slightly larger model cuckoo eggs. Since cuckoos in this situation can effectively parasitize despite laying eggs slightly larger than those of their hosts, there are little selective pressures to evolve &quot;perfect&quot; mimicry.

To select the most suitable host nests, cuckoos may &quot;egg-match&quot; as well. Daurian redstarts (&quot;Phoenicurus auroreus&quot;), another cuckoo host, lay clutches of either pink or blue eggs. Cuckoo eggs are more similar in reflectance and color to blue redstart eggs than pink ones. Furthermore, in-field observations revealed parasitism occurred more frequently in blue-egg redstart nests (19.3%) than in pink-egg redstart nests (7.9%). This suggests cuckoos prefer parasitizing nests containing eggs resembling their own. Experiments in the lab show similar findings: cuckoos parasitized artificial nests containing blue eggs more frequently than pink ones.

Two main hypotheses on the cognitive mechanisms mediate host distinguishing of eggs. One hypothesis is true recognition, which states that a host compares eggs present in its clutch to an internal template (learnt or innate), to identify if parasitic eggs are present. However, memorizing a template of a parasitic egg is costly and imperfect and likely not identical to each host&#x27;s egg. The other one is the discordancy hypothesis, which states that a host compares eggs in the clutch and identifies the odd ones. However, if parasitic eggs made the majority of eggs in the clutch, then hosts ends up rejecting their own eggs. More recent studies have found that both mechanisms more likely contribute to host discrimination of parasitic eggs since one compensates for the limitations of the other.

===== Possible evidence of host benefits in the face of cuckoo parasitism =====
The parasitism is not necessarily entirely detrimental to the host species. A 16-year dataset was used in 2014 to find that carrion crow nests in a region of northern Spain were more successful overall (more likely to produce at least one crow fledgling) when parasitised by the great spotted cuckoo. The researchers attributed this to a strong-smelling predator-repelling substance secreted by cuckoo chicks when attacked, and noted that the interactions were not necessarily simply parasitic or mutualistic. This relationship was not observed for any other host species, or for any other species of cuckoo. Great spotted cuckoo chicks do not evict host eggs or young, and are smaller and weaker than carrion crow chicks, so both of these factors may have contributed to the effect observed.

However, subsequent research using a dataset from southern Spain failed to replicate these findings, and the second research team also criticised the methodology used in experiments described in the first paper. The authors of the first study have responded to points made in the second and both groups agree that further research is needed before the mutualistic effect can be considered proven.

=== Calls ===
Cuckoos are often highly secretive, and in many cases, best known for their wide repertoire of calls. These are usually relatively simple, resembling whistles, flutes, or hiccups. The calls are used to demonstrate ownership of a territory and to attract a mate. Within a species, the calls are remarkably consistent across the range, even in species with very large ranges. This suggests, along with the fact that many species are not raised by their true parents, that the calls of cuckoos are innate and not learnt. Although cuckoos are diurnal, many species call at night.

The cuckoo family gets its English and scientific names from the call of the male cuckoo, also familiar from cuckoo clocks. In most cuckoos, the calls are distinctive to particular species, and are useful for identification. Several cryptic species are best identified on the basis of their calls.

==Phylogeny and evolution==
The family Cuculidae was introduced by English zoologist William Elford Leach in a guide to the contents of the British Museum published in 1819.

Very little fossil record of cuckoos has been found, and their evolutionary history remains unclear. &quot;Dynamopterus&quot; was an Oligocene genus of large cuckoo, though it may have been related to cariamas, instead.

A 2014 genome analysis by Erich Jarvis and collaborators found a clade of birds that contains the orders Cuculiformes (cuckoos), Musophagiformes (turacos), and Otidiformes (bustards). This has been named the Otidimorphae. Relationships between the orders is unclear.

The following cladogram shows the phylogenetic relationships between the genera. It is from a 2005 study by Michael Sorenson and Robert Payne and is based solely on an analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences. The number of species in each genus is taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).

== Taxonomy and systematics ==


For the living members of each genus, see the article List of cuckoo species.

The family Cuculidae contains 150 species which are divided into 33 genera. These numbers include two species that have become extinct in historical times: the snail-eating coua from Madagascar and the Saint Helena cuckoo which is placed in its own genus Nannococcyx.

== In human culture ==

In Greek mythology, the god Zeus transformed himself into a cuckoo so that he could seduce the goddess Hera, to whom the bird was sacred. Three sacred cuckoos appear in the Finnish epic the Kalevala, connected to the death of a young girl who was being forced into marriage. In England, William Shakespeare alludes to the common cuckoo&#x27;s association with spring, and with cuckoldry, in the courtly springtime song in his play &quot;Love&#x27;s Labours Lost&quot;. In India, cuckoos are sacred to Kamadeva, the god of desire and longing, whereas in Japan, the cuckoo symbolises unrequited love. Cuckoos are a sacred animal to the Bon religion of Tibet. Additionally, the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species gave rise to the term &quot;cuckold&quot;, referring to the husband of an adulterous wife.

The orchestral composition &quot;On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring&quot; by Frederick Delius imitates sounds of the cuckoo.

<text>BBC Radio 4 Extra (formerly BBC Radio 7) is a British digital radio station owned and operated by the BBC. The sister station of BBC Radio 4, it mostly broadcasts archived repeats of comedy, drama and documentary programmes. It is the principal broadcaster of the BBC&#x27;s spoken-word archive, and as a result the majority of its programming originates from that archive. It also broadcasts extended and companion programmes to those broadcast on Radio 4, and provides a &quot;catch-up&quot; service for certain programmes.

The station launched in December 2002 as BBC 7, broadcasting a mix of archive comedy, drama and current children&#x27;s radio. The station was renamed BBC Radio 7 in 2008, then relaunched as BBC Radio 4 Extra in April 2011. For the first quarter of 2013, Radio 4 Extra had a weekly audience of 1.642 million people and had a market share of 0.95%; in the last quarter of 2016 the numbers were 2.184 million listeners and 1.2% of market share.

According to RAJAR, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 1.5 million with a listening share of 1.3% as of March 2024.

==History==
===BBC 7===
The station was initially launched as BBC 7 on 15 December 2002 by comedian Paul Merton. The first programme was broadcast at 8p.m. and was simulcast with Radio 4. The station, referred to by the codename &#x27;Network Z&#x27; while in development, was named without the word &#x27;Radio&#x27; to reflect the station&#x27;s presence on the internet and on digital television in addition to radio. The station broadcast mostly archived comedy and drama, in that the programme was either three or more years old or had been broadcast twice on their original station.

The station also broadcast a themed section for children&#x27;s programmes. This section carried a variety of programmes, including &quot;The Little Toe Radio Show&quot; (later renamed &quot;CBeebies Radio&quot;), aimed at younger children and consisting of short serials, stories and rhymes, and &quot;The Big Toe Radio Show&quot; and &quot;Arthur Storey and the Department of Historical Correction&quot; with phone-ins, quizzes and stories for the 8+ age group. The segment also hosted the only news programme on the network presented by the &quot;Newsround&quot; team.

The station won the Sony Radio Academy Award for station sound in 2003, was nominated for the Promo Award in 2004, and in 2005 received a silver for the Short-Form award, plus nominations in the speech and digital terrestrial station-of-the-year sections. Because of the station&#x27;s archive nature the station was scheduled, produced and researched by 17 people, excluding presenters.

The station was renamed on 4 October 2008 as BBC Radio 7 in an effort to bring it in line with other BBC Radio brands. It also coincided with the introduction of a new network logo for the station.

During this later period, Radio 7 saw growth in its audience, with a growth rate of 9.5% annually in 2010, going from 931,000 listeners in the first quarter of that year to 949,000 a quarter later, making it the second most listened to BBC digital radio station at the time. However, despite this growth, the audience of children between 4 and 14 was reported to be only at 25,000, and in February 2011 the BBC Trust approved a reduction in hours dedicated to children from 1,400 to 350.

===BBC Radio 4 Extra===

The BBC announced their intention to relaunch the station on 2 March 2010 and following a public consultation, the proposal was approved by the corporation&#x27;s governing body the BBC Trust in February 2011. As a result, the station relaunched as BBC Radio 4 Extra on Saturday 2 April 2011. The relaunched station contained much of the same mix of programming with some new additions that reflected the new alignment with Radio 4, many of which were archive, or extensions or spin-offs of flagship Radio 4 programmes.

On 26 May 2022, as part of planned cuts and streamlining with a greater focus on digital, the BBC announced plans to discontinue Radio 4 Extra as a broadcast station. It will be supplanted by BBC Sounds.

==Broadcast==

BBC Radio 4 Extra is broadcast from Broadcasting House in central London, although due to the nature of the channel very little of the channel&#x27;s content is broadcast live from there; even the continuity announcements are pre-recorded. The channel uses ten continuity announcers to link between programmes. Notable announcers include Wes Butters, Kathy Clugston, Jim Lee, David Miles, Susan Rae, Alex Riley, Alan Smith, Chris Berrow and Steve Urquhart. Previous presenters, including those presenting Radio 7, include Zeb Soanes, Penny Haslam, Helen Aitken, Rory Morrison and Michaela Saunders.

The station is broadcast nationally on digital radiovia the BBC National DAB multiplexand online via BBC Sounds and other services such as Radioplayer. It is also available on a number of digital television platforms; Freeview, Virgin Media, Freesat and Sky.

Until 2019 the controller of the station, who is answerable to the Radio board in the BBC, was Gwyneth Williams. BBC Radio 4 Extra is broadcast in stereo on television and online, although many of the older archive programmes were only recorded in mono. On DAB, all programmes are broadcast in mono, as the maximum bit rate is only 80kbps.

==Programming==

Although the current station is a rebranding of Radio 7 and contains a similar mix of archived programming, content has been brought further in line with BBC Radio 4 with new additions based upon their schedule. These include extended versions of programmes such as &quot;The News Quiz&quot; and &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, the broadcast of archived editions of the latter as &quot;Desert Island Discs Revisited&quot;. It has also previously included the addition of the programme &quot;Ambridge Extra&quot;, a more youth-orientated version of long-running radio soap &quot;The Archers&quot;, and an extended version of &quot;The Now Show&quot;.

Some programming is organised into programme blocks of similar programmes. The late night &quot;Comedy Club&quot; segment broadcasts &quot;two hours of contemporary comedy&quot; most nights of the week and is primarily hosted by Arthur Smith. A long-standing segment that remained following the change from Radio 7, it was previously fronted by Alex Riley and Phil Williams. Comedy previously available as CDs on the &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; label is also broadcast.

Drama is also broadcast, notably in The 7th Dimension segment. A long-running segment continued from Radio 7, the block airs speculative fiction, science fiction, fantasy and horror stories presented by Nicholas Briggs. The segment contains programmes including Doctor Who audio dramas starring Paul McGann as the Eighth Doctor, as well as programmes imported from overseas including American broadcasts &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;Garrison Keillor&#x27;s Radio Show&quot; as well as Stuart McLean&#x27;s &quot;Vinyl Cafe&quot; from Canada. The 7th Dimension was originally broadcast daily, but has now been reduced to weekends-only. With increasing repeats of old Radio 4 documentaries, interviews and &quot;educational/cultural&quot; programmes, some listeners are concerned that the station&#x27;s original mandate to provide comedy, drama and entertainment is being increasingly sidelined.

===Archive===
Much of the channel&#x27;s schedule is formed of repeats from classic comedy and drama. The schedule spans &quot;The Goon Show&quot; (1950s) and &quot;Round the Horne&quot; (1960s), through Radio 2 favourites like &quot;The News Huddlines&quot;, &quot;Castle&#x27;s on the Air&quot; and &quot;Listen to Les&quot;, to recent Radio 4 shows such as &quot;Little Britain&quot; and &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;. Some of this content is newly discovered, such as copies of the version of &quot;Dick Barton Special Agent&quot; that were made for international distribution, and early episodes of &quot;The Goon Show&quot;.

===Original programmes===
The station has broadcast original programmes. &quot;Newsjack&quot; is a topical news sketch show which encourages contributions from listeners. &quot;Spanking New on Seven&quot; was stand-up comedy, and the &quot;BBC New Comedy Competition&quot; a competition for new comedians. Those who went on to have their own series on Radio 7 include John-Luke Roberts with &quot;Spats&quot; and Miriam Elia with &quot;A Series of Psychotic Episodes&quot;.

&quot;The Mitch Benn Music Show&quot; features comedy songs introduced by Mitch Benn. The &quot;Colin and Fergus&#x27; Digi Radio&quot; comedy sketch show ran for two series in 20052006. &quot;Serious About Comedy&quot; is a weekly show presented by Robin Ince in which comedians and comedy critics discussed comedy television, radio, DVDs, and films. &quot;Tilt&quot; is a satirical look at the week&#x27;s news of views other than the norm. &quot;Knocker&quot; is a sitcom about a market researcher, written by and starring Neil Edmond.

From April 2024, &quot;Yesterday In Parliament&quot; and &quot;The Daily Service&quot; both moved to the station, as the BBC prepared to remove Radio 4 from Long Wave transmitters, making the existing opt-out from Radio 4&#x27;s FM programme impossible.

<text>William Moultrie (; November 23, 1730 – September 27, 1805) was an American slaveowning planter and politician who became a general in the American Revolutionary War. As colonel leading a state militia, in 1776 he prevented the British from taking Charleston, and Fort Moultrie was named in his honor.

After independence, Moultrie advanced as a politician; he was elected by the legislature twice within a decade as Governor of South Carolina (1785–1787, 1792–1794), serving two terms. (The state constitution kept power in the hands of the legislature and prohibited governors from serving two terms in succession.)

William Moultrie was born in Charles Town in the Province of South Carolina. His parents were the Scottish physician Dr. John Moultrie and Lucretia Cooper, and he acquired a slave plantation, enslaving over 200 African Americans.

Moultrie fought in the Anglo-Cherokee War (1761). Before the advent of the American Revolution, he was elected to the colonial assembly representing St. Helena Parish.

In 1775, Moultrie was commissioned as colonel of the 2nd South Carolina Regiment of provincial troops. In 1776, Moultrie&#x27;s defense of a small fort on Sullivan&#x27;s Island (later named Fort Moultrie in his honor) prevented Sir Henry Clinton and Sir Peter Parker from taking Charleston. The Continental Congress passed a resolution thanking Moultrie. He was promoted to brigadier general and his regiment was taken into the Continental Army.

Moultrie successfully led a repulse of the British at Port Royal in February 1779. That spring when Maj. Gen. Benjamin Lincoln took the bulk of the American force towards Augusta, Georgia, Moultrie was stationed at Black Swamp with a small contingent to watch the British on the other side of the Savannah River. When the British suddenly crossed the Savannah en masse and tried to move on Charleston, Moultrie managed a skillful tactical retreat across the Coosawhatchie and the Tullifiny Rivers and all the way back to Charleston where he held off a short siege. He refused to surrender at a time when the civilian authorities in Charleston felt somewhat abandoned by the Continental Congress and were almost ready to give up.

Moultrie was captured when Charleston surrendered to the British in 1780. He was left in command of the American POWs which required all of the patience and skill of a diplomat when advocating for his men against the harsh British commandant, Lt. Col. Nisbet Balfour. The British also attempted to lure him to their side, and he was absolutely indignant when he was approached by Charles Greville Montague. Moultrie was exchanged for British prisoners in 1782. The same year, he was promoted to major general, the last man appointed by Congress to that rank.

After the war he was elected by the new state legislature as 35th Governor of South Carolina (1785–1787). The state constitution prohibited men from serving two successive terms as governor, an effort to keep power in the hands of the legislature. Moultrie was re-elected by the legislature in 1792, serving into 1794. He ran one last time for governor in 1798, but lost decisively to fellow Federalist Edward Rutledge.
William Moultrie was the first president of the Society of the Cincinnati of the State of South Carolina and served in that capacity until his death.

In 1802 he published his &quot;Memoirs of the Revolution as far as it Related to the States of North and South Carolina.&quot;


==Legacy==
After the war, the fort he had defended was renamed Fort Moultrie in his honor. It operated as a pivotal defense point until supplanted by Fort Sumter. Fort Moultrie was used as an active post of the United States Army from 1798 until the end of World War Two.

Moultrie County, Illinois is also named in his honor. Ochlockoney, Georgia was renamed in 1859 as Moultrie when it was incorporated by the Georgia General Assembly.

===Moultrie Flag===
During his notable defense of the fort in 1776, a flag of Moultrie&#x27;s own design was flown: a field of blue bearing a white crescent with the word LIBERTY on it. The flag was shot down during the fight. Sergeant William Jasper held it up to rally the troops, and the story became widely known. The flag became an icon of the Revolution in the South. It was called the Moultrie, or the Liberty Flag. The new state of South Carolina incorporated its design into its state flag.

<doc id="207275" wikidata="Q1104302" url="?curid=207275" title="Coalition of Progressive Electors">
<text>The Coalition of Progressive Electors (COPE) is a municipal political party in the Canadian city of Vancouver, British Columbia. It has traditionally been associated with tenants, environmentalists, and the labour movement. COPE is generally guided by democratic socialist principles following the split of its social democratic wing in 2014 to form OneCity Vancouver, and has a long history of advocating for issues such as improving public transit and investing in affordable housing. It last held a majority government on city council from 2002 to 2005. COPE describes itself as being committed to renter protections, ending homelessness, taxing the rich to build social housing, safe supply, free transit, Indigenous reconciliation, climate action, and other social and environmental reforms.

== History ==
COPE was formed in 1968, originally as the &quot;Committee of Progressive Electors&quot;, when a number of left-wing community groups and social justice organizations joined with the city&#x27;s Labour Council to organize more effectively against the Non-Partisan Association (NPA) – a centre-right political party which had dominated civic politics in Vancouver. Frank Kennedy of the Vancouver &amp; District Labour Council and Harry Rankin, an outspoken lawyer and city councillor, were key figures in shaping the coalition, along with activists from the British Columbia New Democratic Party and the Communist Party of British Columbia.

=== Beginnings: 1970s and 1980s ===
For most of its history, COPE existed in an uneasy relationship with centre-left parties at the municipal level. From 1972 to 1986 COPE competed with The Electors&#x27; Action Movement, which governed the city under prominent federal Liberal mayor Art Phillips in the mid-1970s. By the late 1970s, a breakaway faction of TEAM, comprising provincial NDP supporters and led by future premier Michael Harcourt formed an electoral alliance with COPE, from which both parties benefited. Led by Harcourt, the coalition governed from the centre and, although it ran a unified slate with COPE with the cooperation and support of the VDLC, Harcourt&#x27;s small party of Civic Independents would sometimes vote with the councillors associated with the NDP and the remaining TEAM councillors against COPE&#x27;s more socialist policies.

When Harcourt stepped down to become a provincial candidate and a renewed NPA led by future premier Gordon Campbell absorbed TEAM&#x27;s two remaining councillors, COPE became the senior partner in its coalition with the Civic Independents. Nominating Rankin as its mayoral candidate, COPE fielded a virtually full slate of candidates (leaving three open spaces for the incumbent Civic Independents) but was badly beaten, the NPA returning to power for the first time in 14 years, and deprived for the next two years of Rankin&#x27;s leadership in the council chamber.

=== COPE and independents: 1980s–1990s ===
In 1988, COPE entered the election an equal partner with the newly formed Civic New Democrats (Civic NDP), a party directly affiliated with the BC NDP. Led by anti-poverty activist Jean Swanson, the coalition made few gains, but under the leadership of Jim Green in 1990, the party came close to winning the election. While all COPE council candidates were elected, no Civic NDP candidates were (since a 1983 by-election, COPE had consistently out-performed all other leftist candidates on the concurrently elected School and Parks Boards). At this point, Vancouver&#x27;s civic left conceded that the COPE brand was now more popular than any more centrist group. Thus, following the 1990 election, COPE merged with the Civic NDP, changing its name from the Committee of Progressive Electors to the Coalition of Progressive Electors. At this time, COPE made an official overture to the Green Party of Vancouver, the local affiliate of the Green Party of British Columbia, offering the group some minor policy concessions, joint billing in the party&#x27;s ballot name (&quot;COPE-Green &#x27;93&quot;) and assurances that important party members would ensure some Greens were nominated. The Greens turned the deal down.

Starting in 1993, COPE nominated candidates for all civic offices (mayor, city councillor, school board trustee, and park commissioner) but its closer affiliation with an incumbent provincial NDP government and inability to negotiate a deal with the Greens, who began siphoning votes in increasing numbers, resulted in flagging performance. Rankin&#x27;s retirement from council also damaged the party. In 1993, COPE&#x27;s representation fell to only one councillor, future MLA Jenny Kwan. COPE did not win any seats in 1996, thanks to a strong showing for the Greens and a left-right coalition called VOICE, led by Rankin&#x27;s wife Connie Fogal and 1984 mayoral candidate Jonathan Baker. With this fragmentation of the civic left, the NPA won all 27 contested seats in that election with only 43% of the vote.

In 1999, COPE regained its footholds on school board and city council and the Greens gained a seat on the park board under the leadership of mayoral candidate David Cadman. The two independent candidates who had also joined the coalition were defeated, although former NPA councillor Nancy Chiavario came close to keeping her council seat after being pushed out by supporters of Jennifer Clarke at the NPA nominating meeting.

=== COPE&#x27;s first government: 2002 ===
In 2002, the NPA was divided between a right-wing faction led by Jennifer Clarke and a moderate faction led by and NPA mayor Philip Owen, creating the possibility of a COPE majority.

Former chief coroner and RCMP officer Larry Campbell, fictionalized on the CBC show &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Inquest&quot;, was nominated by COPE as its mayoral candidate. Although Campbell attempted to keep the Greens in the fold, a new provincial leadership had taken control and pulled the party out of its municipal coalitions.

Clarke&#x27;s takeover of the NPA and her purge of its centrists was highly unpopular with Vancouver voters, especially her movement&#x27;s deposition of the incumbent mayor, an ally of Campbell. In the 2002 municipal election, an unprecedented surge in voter turnout elected the first COPE mayor and board majorities in Vancouver&#x27;s history. Every candidate running under COPE&#x27;s banner was elected.

As the governing party, COPE created a new Climate Task Force, implemented ethical purchasing policy, built bike routes, and legalized secondary suites, among other initiatives.

=== Vision Vancouver splits: 2005 ===
By late 2004, there were growing signs of disunity between the COPE mayor and some COPE councillors. Campbell formed an independent caucus along with three of his COPE colleagues (although they all remained as members of the party). The other COPE councillors remained in the original COPE caucus.

The maverick COPE councillors (dubbed &quot;COPE Lite&quot; or &quot;Diet COPE&quot; by the media) eventually separated and formed a new party, Vision Vancouver, to run in the 2005 municipal election. COPE did not run a mayoral candidate to challenge Vision nominee, former COPE councillor Jim Green.

In the election for Vancouver City Council held in November 2005, only one COPE councillor (David Cadman) was elected. The party was reduced to three seats on the city school board and two on the parks board, newcomer Spencer Herbert, and Loretta Woodcock.

=== More alliances: 2007–2008 ===
In May 2007, a slate was elected to the COPE executive, called &quot;the group of seven&quot; by some media. All seven members of the slate were elected with a mandate to seek an electoral coalition with Vision Vancouver. From 2007 to 2008, 50% of COPE&#x27;s executive was under the age of 30, unprecedented for a major civic municipal party in Canada. COPE made overtures to Vision Vancouver to enter into a coalition for the 2008 election &quot;to defeat the NPA&quot; with little success. It was not until Gregor Robertson was nominated as Vision Vancouver&#x27;s mayoral candidate that formal negotiations between the two organizations began in early summer of 2008.

COPE and Vision Vancouver reached a tentative agreement in late summer 2008, which was later ratified by the Vision Vancouver executive and COPE membership. COPE agreed not to run a mayoral candidate to avoid splitting the progressive vote.

=== Decline: 2008–2011 ===
In the 2008 Vancouver municipal election voters replaced the NPA-dominated council with a near sweep of COPE, Green and Vision Vancouver candidates. COPE elected six of nine candidates across the city council, the park board, and the school board, running a new media and youth-oriented campaign.

In the leadup to the 2011 election, several party activists launched a campaign to separate from Vision Vancouver, arguing that in coalition with Vision, that COPE &quot;[hadn&#x27;t] been able to do anything.&quot; The activists were defeated by the majority of COPE members.

In the November 19, 2011 election, a single COPE candidate was elected. The elected candidate was incumbent Allan Wong, as one of nine school trustees. COPE ran a total of nine candidates in the election.

On December 8, 2013, Allan Wong, COPE&#x27;s sole elected politician, resigned from the party to join Vision Vancouver.

=== 2011–2014 ===
After the election loss in 2011, a group called &quot;Independent COPE&quot; was elected to COPE&#x27;s executive board.

During this time, a number of high-profile COPE members and former candidates left the party, including former Vancouver School Board trustee Jane Bouey, former BC NDP MLA David Chudnovsky, former candidates RJ Aquino and Gwen Giesbrecht, and Stuart Parker.

At the party&#x27;s annual general meeting in 2013, Independent COPE captured a majority by a wide margin. The membership also passed a motion to run a mayoral candidate in the 2014 election, and a majority of candidates for city council, school board, and park board.

In September 2014, only two of COPE&#x27;s 17 candidates were endorsed by the Vancouver &amp; District Labour Council – the labour organization that helped found the political party nearly five decades prior.

=== 2014 municipal election ===
At a general meeting in September 2014, an overwhelming majority of COPE membership endorsed Meena Wong as the 2014 mayoral candidate. The community organizer and activist stated that the focuses of her campaign would be giving citizens a voice and keeping housing affordable. She also proposed a tax on vacant homes in Vancouver.

In addition to Wong, the membership endorsed a slate of 16 candidates, including former councillor Tim Louis. In accordance with the party&#x27;s equity policy there was an Indigenous candidate for each board and the majority of candidates were female.

The party&#x27;s 2014 election platform advocated for a new Vancouver Housing Authority, for Vancouver to become a sanctuary city, to implement a municipal minimum wage of $15 per hour, and to hold a referendum for electoral reform to consider switching from a first-past-the-post voting system to a proportional representation system.

=== 2018 municipal election ===
COPE ran seven candidates in the 2018 Vancouver municipal election: Jean Swanson, Derrick O&#x27;Keefe, and Anne Roberts for city council; Gwen Giesbrecht and John Irwin for park board; and Diana Day and Barb Parrott for school board. The party had four of its candidates elected and achieved representation on each of the city&#x27;s boards. The 2018 COPE campaign called for a mansion tax to end homelessness, a moratorium on , and a four-year rent freeze.

=== 2022 municipal election ===
COPE ran nine candidates in the 2022 Vancouver municipal election, including incumbent councillor Jean Swanson and former NDP candidate Breen Ouelette for city council, and incumbent park board commissioner Gwen Giesbrecht. Both incumbents lost re-election, while school board candidate Suzie Mah was elected, placing seventh.

<doc id="207277" wikidata="Q18845" url="?curid=207277" title="Common cuckoo">
<text>The cuckoo, common cuckoo, European cuckoo or Eurasian cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) is a member of the cuckoo order of birds, Cuculiformes, which includes the roadrunners, the anis and the coucals.

This species is a widespread summer migrant to Europe and Asia, and winters in Africa. It is a brood parasite, which means it lays eggs in the nests of other bird species, particularly of dunnocks, meadow pipits, and reed warblers. Although its eggs are larger than those of its hosts, the eggs in each type of host nest resemble the host&#x27;s eggs. The adult too is a mimic, in its case of the sparrowhawk; since that species is a predator, the mimicry gives the female time to lay her eggs without being attacked.

==Taxonomy==
The species&#x27; binomial name is derived from the Latin (the cuckoo) and (melodious; from , meaning &quot;to sing&quot;). The cuckoo family gets its common name and genus name by onomatopoeia for the call of the male common cuckoo. The English word &quot;cuckoo&quot; comes from the Old French , and its earliest recorded usage in English is from around 1240, in the song .

There are four subspecies worldwide:
* &quot;C. c. canorus&quot;, the nominate subspecies, was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. It occurs from Ireland through Scandinavia, northern Russia and Siberia to Japan in the east, and from the Pyrenees through Turkey, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, northern China and Korea. It winters in Africa and South Asia.
* &quot;C. c. bakeri&quot;, first described by Hartert in 1912, breeds in western China to the Himalayan foothills in northern India, Nepal, Myanmar, northwestern Thailand and southern China. During the winter it is found in Assam, East Bengal and southeastern Asia.
* &quot;C. c. bangsi&quot; was first described by Oberholser in 1919 and breeds in Iberia, the Balearic Islands and North Africa, spending the winter in Africa.
* &quot;C. c. subtelephonus&quot;, first described by Zarudny in 1914, breeds in Central Asia from Turkestan to southern Mongolia. It migrates to southern Asia and Africa for the winter.

==Lifespan and demography==
Although the common cuckoo&#x27;s global population appears to be declining, it is classified of being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It is estimated that the species numbers between 25 million and 100 million individuals worldwide, with around 12.6 million to 25.8 million of those birds breeding in Europe. The longest recorded lifespan of a common cuckoo in the United Kingdom is 6 years, 11 months and 2 days.

==Description==

The common cuckoo is long from bill to tail, with a tail of and a wingspan of . The legs are short. It has a greyish, slender body and long tail, similar to a sparrowhawk in flight, where the wingbeats are regular. During the breeding season, common cuckoos often settle on an open perch with drooped wings and raised tail. There is a rufous colour morph, which occurs occasionally in adult females but more often in juveniles. It has been hypothesized to have evolved as a deterrence to male harassment or host species mobbing.
All adult males are slate-grey; the grey throat extends well down the bird&#x27;s breast with a sharp demarcation to the barred underparts. The iris, orbital ring, the base of the bill and feet are yellow. Grey adult females have a pinkish-buff or buff background to the barring and neck sides, and sometimes small rufous spots on the median and greater coverts and the outer webs of the secondary feathers.

Rufous morph adult females have reddish-brown upperparts with dark grey or black bars. The black upperpart bars are narrower than the rufous bars, as opposed to rufous juvenile birds, where the black bars are broader.

Common cuckoos in their first autumn have variable plumage. Some have strongly-barred chestnut-brown upperparts, while others are plain grey. Rufous-brown birds have heavily barred upperparts with some feathers edged with creamy-white. All have whitish edges to the upper wing-coverts and primaries. The secondaries and greater coverts have chestnut bars or spots. In spring, birds hatched in the previous year may retain some barred secondaries and wing-coverts. The most obvious identification features of juvenile common cuckoos are the white nape patch and white feather fringes.

Common cuckoos moult twice a year: a partial moult in summer and a complete moult in winter. Males weigh around and females . The common cuckoo looks very similar to the Oriental cuckoo, which is slightly shorter-winged on average. This resemblance extends even to the rufous morphs, which are also present in Oriental cuckoos. The presence of rufous morphs may well be ancestral to both Oriental cuckoos and common cuckoos.

==Mimicry in adults==

The barred underparts of the common cuckoo resemble those of the Eurasian sparrowhawk, a predator of adult birds. A study comparing the responses of Eurasian reed warblers, a host of cuckoo chicks, to manipulated taxidermy model cuckoos and sparrowhawks found that reed warblers were more aggressive to cuckoos with obscured underparts, suggesting that the resemblance to sparrowhawks is likely to help the cuckoo access the nests of potential hosts. Other small birds, great tits and blue tits, showed alarm and avoided attending feeders on seeing either (mounted) sparrowhawks or cuckoos; this implies that the cuckoo&#x27;s hawklike appearance functions as protective mimicry, whether to reduce attacks by hawks or to make brood parasitism easier.

Hosts attack cuckoos more when they see neighbors mobbing cuckoos. The existence of the two plumage morphs in females may be due to frequency-dependent selection if this learning applies only to the morph that hosts see neighbors mob. In an experiment with dummy cuckoos of each morph and a sparrowhawk, reed warblers were more likely to attack both cuckoo morphs than the sparrowhawk, and even more likely to mob a certain cuckoo morph when they saw neighbors mobbing that morph, decreasing the reproductive success of that morph and selecting for the less common morph.

==Voice and courting==

The male&#x27;s song, &quot;goo-ko&quot;, is usually given from an open perch. During the breeding season the male typically gives this vocalisation with intervals of 1–1.5 seconds, in groups of 10–20 with a rest of a few seconds between groups. The female has a loud bubbling call. The song starts as a descending minor third early in the year in April, and the interval gets wider, through a major third to a fourth as the season progresses, and in June the cuckoo &quot;forgets its tune&quot; and may make other calls such as ascending intervals. The wings are drooped when the bird is calling intensely, and when in the vicinity of a potential female, the male often wags its tail from side to side or the body may pivot from side to side.

==Distribution and habitat==
Essentially a bird of open land, the common cuckoo is a widespread summer migrant to Europe and Asia, and winters in Africa. Birds arrive in Europe in April and leave in September. The common cuckoo has also occurred as a vagrant in countries including Barbados, the United States, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Indonesia, Palau, Seychelles, Taiwan and China. Between 1995 and 2015, the distribution of cuckoos within the UK has shifted towards the north, with a decline by 69% in England but an increase by 33% in Scotland.

==Behaviour==

===Food and feeding===
The common cuckoo&#x27;s diet consists of insects, with hairy caterpillars, which are distasteful to many birds, being a specialty of preference. It also occasionally eats eggs and chicks.

==Breeding==


The common cuckoo is an obligate brood parasite; it lays its eggs in the nests of other birds. Hatched cuckoo chicks may push host eggs out of the nest or be raised alongside the host&#x27;s chicks. A female may visit up to 50 nests during a breeding season. Common cuckoos first breed at the age of two years.

===Egg mimicry===
More than 100 host species have been recorded: meadow pipit, dunnock and Eurasian reed warbler are the most common hosts in northern Europe; garden warbler, meadow pipit, pied wagtail and European robin in central Europe; brambling and common redstart in Finland; and great reed warbler in Hungary.

Female common cuckoos are divided into gentes – groups of females favouring a particular host species&#x27; nest and laying eggs that match those of that species in color and pattern. Evidence from mitochondrial DNA analyses suggest that each gente may have multiple independent origins due to parasitism of specific hosts by different ancestors. One hypothesis for the inheritance of egg appearance mimicry is that this trait is inherited from the female only, suggesting that it is carried on the sex-determining W chromosome (females are WZ, males ZZ). A genetic analysis of gentes supports this proposal by finding significant differentiation in mitochondrial DNA, but not in microsatellite DNA. A second proposal for the inheritance of this trait is that the genes controlling egg characteristics are carried on autosomes rather than just the W chromosome. Another genetic analysis of sympatric gentes supports this second proposal by finding significant genetic differentiation in both microsatellite DNA and mitochondrial DNA. Considering the tendency for common cuckoo males to mate with multiple females and produce offspring raised by more than one host species, it appears as though males do not contribute to the maintenance of common cuckoo gentes. However, it was found that only nine percent of offspring were raised outside of their father&#x27;s presumed host species. Therefore, both males and females may contribute to the maintenance of common cuckoo egg mimicry polymorphism. It is notable that most non-parasitic cuckoo species lay white eggs, like most non-passerines other than ground-nesters.

As the common cuckoo evolves to lay eggs that better imitate the host&#x27;s eggs, the host species adapts and is more able to distinguish the cuckoo egg. A study of 248 common cuckoo and host eggs demonstrated that female cuckoos that parasitised common redstart nests laid eggs that matched better than those that targeted dunnocks. Spectroscopy was used to model how the host species saw the cuckoo eggs. Cuckoos that target dunnock nests lay white, brown-speckled eggs, in contrast to the dunnock&#x27;s own blue eggs. The theory suggests that common redstarts have been parasitised by common cuckoos for longer, and so have evolved to be better than the dunnocks at noticing the cuckoo eggs. The cuckoo, over time, has needed to evolve more accurate mimicking eggs to successfully parasitise the redstart. In contrast, cuckoos do not seem to have experienced evolutionary pressure to develop eggs which closely mimic the dunnock&#x27;s, as dunnocks do not seem to be able to distinguish between the two species&#x27; eggs, despite the significant colour differences. The dunnock&#x27;s inability to distinguish the eggs suggests that they have not been parasitised for very long, and have not yet evolved defences against it, unlike the redstart.

Studies performed on great reed warbler nests in central Hungary, showed an &quot;unusually high&quot; frequency of common cuckoo parasitism, with 64% of the nests parasitised. Of the nests targeted by cuckoos, 64% contained one cuckoo egg, 23% had two, 10% had three and 3% had four common cuckoo eggs. In total, 58% of the common cuckoo eggs were laid in nests that were multiply parasitised. When laying eggs in nests already parasitised, the female cuckoos removed one egg at random, showing no discrimination between the great reed warbler eggs and those of other cuckoos.

It was found that nests close to cuckoo perches were most vulnerable: multiple parasitised nests were closest to the vantage points, and unparasitised nests were farthest away. Nearly all the nests &quot;in close vicinity&quot; to the vantage points were parasitised. More visible nests were more likely to be selected by the common cuckoos. Female cuckoos use their vantage points to watch for potential hosts and find it easier to locate the more visible nests while they are egg-laying, however, novel studies highlight that host alarm calls might also play an important role during nest searching. In addition, cuckoos tend to lay the eggs on the host clutch initiation day or one day before.

The great reed warblers&#x27; responses to the common cuckoo eggs varied: 66% accepted the egg(s); 12% ejected them; 20% abandoned the nests entirely; 2% buried the eggs. 28% of the cuckoo eggs were described as &quot;almost perfect&quot; in their mimesis of the host eggs, and the warblers rejected &quot;poorly mimetic&quot; cuckoo eggs more often. The degree of mimicry made it difficult for both the great reed warblers and the observers to tell the eggs apart.

The egg measures and weighs , of which 7% is shell. Research has shown that the female common cuckoo is able to keep its egg inside its body for an extra 24 hours before laying it in a host&#x27;s nest. This means the cuckoo chick can hatch before the host&#x27;s chicks do, and it can eject the unhatched eggs from the nest. Scientists incubated common cuckoo eggs for 24 hours at the bird&#x27;s body temperature of , and examined the embryos, which were found &quot;much more advanced&quot; than those of other species studied. The idea of &#x27;internal incubation&#x27; was first put forward in 1802 and 18th- and 19th-century egg collectors had reported finding that cuckoo embryos were more advanced than those of the host species.

A study using digital photography and spectrometry along with an automatic analytical approach to analyse cuckoo eggs and predict the identity of bird females based on their egg appearance showed that individual cuckoo females lay eggs with a relatively constant appearance, and that eggs laid by more genetically distant females differ more in colour.

===Chicks===
The naked, altricial chick hatches after 11–13 days. It methodically evicts all host progeny from host nests. It is a much larger bird than its hosts, and needs to monopolize the food supplied by the parents. The chick will roll the other eggs out of the nest by pushing them with its back over the edge. If the host&#x27;s eggs hatch before the cuckoo&#x27;s, the cuckoo chick will push the other chicks out of the nest in a similar way. At 14 days old, the common cuckoo chick is about three times the size of an adult Eurasian reed warbler.

The necessity of eviction behavior is unclear. One hypothesis is that competing with host chicks leads to decreased cuckoo chick weight, which is selective pressure for eviction behavior. An analysis of the amount of food provided to common cuckoo chicks by host parents in the presence and absence of host siblings showed that when competing against host siblings, cuckoo chicks did not receive enough food, showing an inability to compete. Selection pressure for eviction behavior may come from cuckoo chicks lacking the correct visual begging signals, hosts distributing food to all nestlings equally, or host recognition of the parasite. Another hypothesis is that decreased cuckoo chick weight is not selective pressure for eviction behavior. An analysis of resources provided to cuckoo chicks in the presence and absence of host siblings also showed that the weights of cuckoos raised with host chicks were much smaller upon fledging than cuckoos raised alone, but within 12 days cuckoos raised with siblings grew faster than cuckoos raised alone and made up for developmental differences, showing a flexibility that would not necessarily select for eviction behavior.

Species whose broods are parasitised by the common cuckoo have evolved to discriminate against cuckoo eggs but not chicks. Experiments have shown that common cuckoo chicks persuade their host parents to feed them by making a rapid begging call that sounds &quot;remarkably like a whole brood of host chicks&quot;. The researchers suggested that &quot;the cuckoo needs vocal trickery to stimulate adequate care to compensate for the fact that it presents a visual stimulus of just one gape&quot;. However, a cuckoo chick needs the amount of food of a whole brood of host nestlings, and it struggles to elicit that much from the host parents with only the vocal stimulus. This may reflect a tradeoff—the cuckoo chick benefits from eviction by receiving all the food provided, but faces a cost in being the only one influencing feeding rate. For this reason, cuckoo chicks exploit host parental care by remaining with the host parent longer than host chicks do, both before and after fledging.

Common cuckoo chicks fledge about 17–21 days after hatching, compared to 12–13 days for Eurasian reed warblers. If the hen cuckoo is out-of-phase with a clutch of Eurasian reed warbler eggs, she will eat them all so that the hosts are forced to start another brood.

The common cuckoo&#x27;s behaviour was firstly observed and described by Aristotle and the combination of behaviour and anatomical adaptation by Edward Jenner, who was elected as Fellow of the Royal Society in 1788 for this work rather than for his development of the smallpox vaccine. It was first documented on film in 1922 by Edgar Chance and Oliver G. Pike, in their film &quot;The Cuckoo&#x27;s Secret&quot;.
A study in Japan found that young common cuckoos probably acquire species-specific feather lice from body-to-body contact with other cuckoos between the time of leaving the nest and returning to the breeding area in spring. A total of 21 nestlings were examined shortly before they left their hosts&#x27; nests and none carried feather lice. However, young birds returning to Japan for the first time were found just as likely as older individuals to be lousy.

==As a biodiversity indicator==

The occurrence of common cuckoo in Europe is a good surrogate for biodiversity facets including taxonomic diversity and functional diversity in bird communities, and better than the traditional use of top predators as bioindicators. The reason for this is the strong correlation between the cuckoo&#x27;s host species richness and overall bird species richness, due to co-evolutionary relationships. This may be useful for citizen science.

==In culture==
Aristotle was aware of the old tale that cuckoos turned into hawks in winter. The tale was an explanation for their absence outside the summer season, later accepted by Pliny the Elder in his &quot;Natural History&quot;. Aristotle rejected the claim, observing in his &quot;History of Animals&quot; that cuckoos do not have the predators&#x27; talons or hooked bills. These Classical era accounts were known to the Early Modern English naturalist, William Turner.

The 13th-century medieval English round, &quot;Sumer Is Icumen In&quot;, celebrates the cuckoo as a sign of spring, the beginning of summer, in the first stanza, and in the chorus:
;Middle English
&lt;poem&gt;
Svmer is icumen in
Lhude sing cuccu
Groweþ sed
and bloweþ med
and springþ þe wde nu
Sing cuccu
&lt;/poem&gt;

;Modern English
&lt;poem&gt;
Summer has arrived,
Sing loudly, cuckoo!
The seed is growing
And the meadow is blooming,
And the wood is coming into leaf now,
Sing, cuckoo!
&lt;/poem&gt;
In England, William Shakespeare alludes to the common cuckoo&#x27;s association with spring, and with cuckoldry, in the courtly springtime song in his play &quot;Love&#x27;s Labours Lost&quot;:

:When daisies pied and violets blue
:::And lady-smocks all silver-white
:And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
:::Do paint the meadows with delight,
:The cuckoo then, on every tree,
:Mocks married men; for thus sings he: 
:::&quot;Cuckoo;
:Cuckoo, cuckoo!&quot; O, word of fear,
:::Unpleasing to a married ear!
In Europe, hearing the call of the common cuckoo is regarded as the first harbinger of spring. Many local legends and traditions are based on this. In Scotland, gowk stanes (cuckoo stones) sometimes associated with the arrival of the first cuckoo of spring. &quot;Gowk&quot; is an old name for the common cuckoo in northern England, derived from the harsh repeated &quot;gowk&quot; call the bird makes when excited. The well-known cuckoo clock features a mechanical bird and is fitted with bellows and pipes that imitate the call of the common cuckoo. Cuckoos feature in traditional rhymes, such as &#x27;&quot;In April the cuckoo comes, In May she&#x27;ll stay, In June she changes her tune, In July she prepares to fly, Come August, go she must,&quot;&#x27; quoted Peggy. &#x27;But you haven&#x27;t said it all,&#x27; put in Bobby. &#x27;&quot;And if the cuckoo stays till September, It&#x27;s as much as the oldest man can remember.&quot;&#x27;

&quot;On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring&quot; is a symphonic poem from Norway composed for orchestra by Frederick Delius.

Two English folk songs feature cuckoos. One usually called &quot;The Cuckoo&quot; starts:

The cuckoo is a fine bird and she sings as she flies,
She brings us good tidings, she tells us no lies.
She sucks little birds&#x27; eggs to make her voice clear,
And never sings cuckoo till the summer draws near
The second, &quot;The Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; is a song about a courtship, with the eponymous (and of course, non-existent) nest serving as a metaphor for the vulva and its tangled &quot;nest&quot; of pubic hair.
Some like a girl who is pretty in the face
and some like a girl who is slender in the waist
But give me a girl who will wriggle and will twist
At the bottom of the belly lies the cuckoo&#x27;s nest...

...Me darling, says she, I can do no such thing
For me mother often told me it was committing sin
Me maidenhead to lose and me sex to be abused
So have no more to do with me cuckoo&#x27;s nest
One of the tales of the Wise Men of Gotham tells how they built a hedge round a tree in order to trap a cuckoo so that it would always be summer.

The theme music for film comedians Laurel and Hardy, titled &quot;Dance of The Cuckoos&quot; and composed by Marvin Hatley, was based on the call of the common cuckoo.

<doc id="207286" wikidata="Q1680169" url="?curid=207286" title="Larry Campbell">
<text>Larry W. Campbell (born February 28, 1948) is a Canadian politician who was the 37th mayor of Vancouver, Canada, from 2002 until 2005, and a member of the Senate of Canada from 2005 until his retirement in 2023.

Before he was mayor, Campbell worked for the RCMP as a police officer, and in 1969, he was transferred to the Vancouver detachment. From 1973, he served as a member of the force&#x27;s drug squad.

Starting in 1981, Campbell worked for the Vancouver District Coroner&#x27;s office and in 1996 was appointed BC Chief Coroner, a post in which he served until 2000.

== Early career ==
Originally from Ontario and of Scottish descent, after high school Campbell&#x27;s grandfather found him a job digging ditches for coaxial cable. Later he was a steel worker as a hand riveter in a boxcar plant in Hamilton. He joined the RCMP on a bet with a Hamilton municipal police officer. He spent about three years in uniform, but did not like to issue traffic tickets. He was transferred to the drug squad in Vancouver where he worked in street enforcement mainly regarding heroin, including undercover work. He started a drug squad in Langley. Throughout his RCMP tenure, he never laid a single marijuana charge.

After serving in the RCMP for 12 years, the provincial chief coroner told him that the new Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms would negatively impact his drug enforcement efforts and convinced him to become Vancouver&#x27;s coroner. During the emerging AIDS pandemic, he became a strong advocate for progressive harm reduction policies, quipping that needle exchanges causing drug addiction &quot;is like flies causing garbage&quot;. He served for 20 years, retiring as chief coroner for the province.

As the city&#x27;s former chief coroner, his life inspired a popular CBC Television drama called &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Inquest&quot;. The show was later followed by a spinoff, &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s City Hall&quot;, in which the Da Vinci character followed his real-life counterpart into politics. He was also one of several coroners who dismissed the murders of several indigenous women in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver between 1967 and 1985 as &quot;unnatural and accidental.&quot;

== Mayor ==
Campbell was elected mayor in the 2002 Vancouver municipal election as a member of the Coalition of Progressive Electors, by a large margin of 58% to 30% for his nearest opponent.

Shortly after Campbell&#x27;s election, divisions began to emerge within his COPE party between a centrist group, led by Campbell and a more left-wing group. On December 14, 2004, Campbell and councillors Jim Green, Raymond Louie and Tim Stevenson announced that they would form an independent caucus within COPE. The media quickly dubbed the bloc the &quot;COPE Light&quot; councillors (in contrast to the &quot;COPE Classic&quot; councillors). In 2005, the moderate group formed the centre-left Vision Vancouver party, but Campbell announced he would not run for re-election.

== Senate ==
On August 2, 2005, Prime Minister Paul Martin announced Campbell&#x27;s appointment by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson as a Liberal senator. Campbell completed his term as mayor before taking up his seat in the Canadian Senate.

On January 29, 2014, Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau announced all Liberal senators, including Campbell, were removed from the Liberal caucus, and would continue sitting as Independents. According to Senate Opposition leader James Cowan, the senators will still refer to themselves as Liberals even if they are no longer members of the parliamentary Liberal caucus.

On April 6, 2016, Campbell left the Senate Liberal Caucus to sit as an Independent and later joined the Independent Senators Group. On November 4, 2019, he joined the Canadian Senators Group. On October 24, 2022, Campbell left the CSG to sit as a non-affiliated senator. Campbell remained an independent senator until February 28, 2023, when he reached the mandatory retirement age of 75.

<doc id="207295" wikidata="Q675662" url="?curid=207295" title="Fanny Cradock">
<text>Phyllis Nan Sortain Pechey (26 February 1909 – 27 December 1994), better known as Fanny Cradock, was an English restaurant critic, television cook and writer. She frequently appeared on television, at cookery demonstrations and in print with her fourth husband, Major Johnnie Cradock, who played the part of a slightly bumbling hen-pecked husband.

==Early life==
Cradock was born at her maternal grandparents&#x27; house, 33 Fairlop Road, Leytonstone, Essex. The birth was recorded in the registration district of West Ham.

As a child, Cradock lived with her family at Fairlop Road, with her maternal grandparents. A plaque (with her name misspelt) can be found at Fairwood Court, Fairlop Road, London E11: &quot;Fanny Craddock 1909–1994. On this site until 1930 stood a house called Apthorp, birthplace of the famous TV cookery expert Fanny Craddock; born Phyllis Pechey.&quot;

Her birthplace was named after Apthorp Villa, in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, where her grandfather Charles Hancock had been born. Cradock&#x27;s parents did not manage their money well; her mother, Bijou, spent extravagantly, and her father, Archibald, had sizeable gambling debts, many run up in Nice. In attempting to keep their creditors at bay, the family moved around the country, going to Herne Bay in Kent, then to Swanage in Dorset and on to Bournemouth in Dorset, where Archibald&#x27;s brother, Richard Francis Pechey (1872–1963), had become the Vicar of Holy Trinity Church in 1912. While in Bournemouth the 15-year-old Fanny attended Bournemouth High School (now Talbot Heath School).

Archibald moved the family again to Wroxham in Norfolk, around 1927, where his creditors caught up with him, and by 1930 he was appearing in Norfolk&#x27;s bankruptcy court faced with debts of £3,500. Cradock began the next ten years of her life in London living in destitution, selling cleaning products door to door. She then worked in a dressmaking shop.

==Culinary career==
Cradock&#x27;s fortunes began to change when she started work at various restaurants and was introduced to the works of Auguste Escoffier. She later wrote passionately about the change from &quot;service à la française&quot; to &quot;service à la russe&quot; and hailed Escoffier as a saviour of British cooking.

Fanny and Johnnie Cradock began writing a column under the pen name of &quot;Bon Viveur&quot; which appeared in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; from 1950 to 1955. This sparked a theatre career, with the pair turning theatres into restaurants. Cradock would cook vast dishes that were served to the audience. They became known for their roast turkey, complete with stuffed head, tail feathers and wings. Complete with French accents, their act was one of a drunken hen-pecked husband and a domineering wife. At this time, they were known as Major and Mrs Cradock. She also wrote books under the names Frances Dale, Bon Viveur, Susan Leigh and Phyllis Cradock.

==TV personality==

In 1955 Cradock recorded a pilot for what became a very successful BBC television series on cookery. Each year the BBC published a booklet giving a detailed account of every recipe Fanny demonstrated, allowing her to frequently say in later years, &quot;You&#x27;ll find that recipe in the booklet, so I won&#x27;t show you now.&quot; Fanny advocated bringing Escoffier-standard food into the British home and gave every recipe a French name. Her food looked extravagant, but was generally cost-effective, and Fanny seemed to care about her audience. Her catchphrases included &quot;This won&#x27;t break you&quot;, &quot;This is perfectly economical&quot;, and &quot;This won&#x27;t stretch your purse&quot;. When presenting her Christmas cake recipe she once justified the cost of ingredients, saying &quot;But on the other hand, we do want one piece of decent cake in the year.&quot;

As time went by, however, her food began to seem outdated, with her love of the piping bag and vegetable dyes. As she grew older, she applied more and more make-up and wore vast chiffon ballgowns on screen. Cradock had always included relatives and friends in her television shows. Johnnie suffered a minor heart attack in the early 1970s and was replaced with the daughter of a friend, Jayne. Another assistant was Sarah, and there was a series of young men who did not last long.

Throughout her television career, the Cradocks also worked for the Gas Council, appearing at trade shows such as the Ideal Home Exhibition and making many &quot;infomercials&quot;, instructing cooks, usually newlywed women, on how to use gas cookers for basic dishes. Despite the BBC&#x27;s ban on advertising, Cradock used only gas stoves in her television shows and often stated that she &quot;hated&quot; electric stoves and ovens.

Her series &quot;Fanny Cradock Cooks for Christmas&quot; is the only one out of several she made to have survived in the TV archives and to have been repeated in recent years, on the UK channels BBC Four, Good Food and Food Network UK, usually in the run-up to Christmas. Good Food also occasionally broadcasts &quot;Fanny Cradock Invites You to a Cheese and Wine Party&quot;, one of a few surviving stand-alone episodes from other series.

Cradock appeared in twenty-four television series between 1955 and 1975.

==Career decline==
In 1976 Gwen Troake, a farmer&#x27;s wife from Devon, won the &quot;Cook of the Realm&quot; competition, leading to the BBC selecting her for its TV series &quot;The Big Time&quot;, where talented amateurs were given the opportunity to take part in a spectacular professional event. Troake was to organise a three-course Foyles&#x27; Literary Lunch at The Dorchester in honour of the former prime minister Edward Heath, with Earl Mountbatten of Burma and other dignitaries in attendance, and asked Cradock—by then a tax exile in Ireland—along with chef Eugene Kaufeler, actor and gourmet Robert Morley, nutritionist Magnus Pyke and many other experts Troake admired to advise her.

The result brought about the demise of Cradock&#x27;s television career. Troake went through her menu of seafood cocktail, duckling with a lemon-jelly-and-cornstarch fortified bramble sauce and coffee cream dessert with rum. Her idea was that with seafood, water fowl and rum, the meal had a nautical theme, which would appeal to Heath&#x27;s love of sailing and also be an appropriate salute to the former Admiral Mountbatten. Cradock, grimacing and acting as if on the verge of gagging, told Troake that her menu was far too rich and she would &quot;never in a million years&quot; serve a seafood cocktail before duck. She appeared not to be familiar with the term &quot;bramble&quot;, and when told it meant a blackberry, was horrified that it would be paired with a savoury duck, remonstrated that a sauce like that should be brushed on a flan. She derisively declared that the jam in it was &quot;too English&quot; and that the English had never had a cuisine, erroneously claiming that &quot;Yorkshire pudding came from Burgundy&quot;. While accepting that Troake&#x27;s dessert was delicious, she insisted that it was not suitable, as it was &quot;too sickly&quot; served after the sweetly sauced, rich duck, countering Troake&#x27;s numerous objections with &quot;Yes, dear, but now you&#x27;re among professionals.&quot;

Cradock suggested that unless Troake were to serve salad and cheese afterwards, as is done in France, then she should use small almond pastry barquettes filled with a palate-cleansing fruit sorbet with spun sugar sails, as this was equally suitable for the naval theme. Troake kept insisting that she liked her signature coffee pudding with &quot;nautical&quot; rum in it, while Cradock appealed to her to think of her diners&#x27; taste buds and stomachs, and try to achieve a balance in her menu. Unfortunately, the replacement dessert was not executed properly, and Morley said he felt that Troake&#x27;s original coffee pudding was perfect.

The public were incensed at Cradock&#x27;s eye-rolling rudeness and condescension, and felt that she had ruined Troake&#x27;s moment. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote &quot;Not since 1940 can the people of England have risen in such unified wrath&quot;. Fanny wrote a letter of apology to Troake, but the BBC terminated her contract two weeks after the broadcast of the programme. She would never again present a cookery programme for the BBC. (Troake, by contrast, published &quot;Gwen Troake&#x27;s Country Cookbook&quot; of recipes the following year; it included the bramble sauce as well as the coffee cream dessert Cradock had vetoed.) Speaking about the incident on &quot;Room 101&quot; in 1999, &quot;The Big Time&quot; producer Esther Rantzen described Cradock as &quot;hell on wheels&quot;, and that she had &quot;reduced this poor little lady [Troake] to nothing&quot;.

==Final years==
Fanny and Johnnie Cradock spent their final years living at Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex. They became regulars on the chat show circuit, and appeared on programmes such as &quot;The Generation Game&quot; and &quot;Blankety Blank&quot;. Fanny appeared alone on &quot;Wogan&quot;, &quot;Parkinson&quot; and &quot;TV-am&quot;. Her final BBC appearance and her final television appearance was in early 1988 on &quot;Windmill&quot;, presented by Chris Serle.

==Personal life==
Cradock was legally married twice; two later marriages were bigamous and therefore void &quot;ab initio&quot;. First, she married Sidney A. Vernon Evans on 10 October 1926 in Sheppey, Kent; she was 17 and he was 22. Cradock married as &quot;Phyllis Nan Primrose Pechey&quot;; &quot;Primrose Pechey&quot; was a form passed down her father&#x27;s side. Sidney Evans died in a plane crash on 4 February 1927, leaving her pregnant with their son Peter Vernon Evans, who was raised by his paternal grandparents. Thanks to Johnnie Cradock, Peter later became a sous-chef at the Dorchester.

By July of the following year, Cradock had become pregnant again, and married the baby&#x27;s father, Arthur William Chapman, on 23 July, in Norwich, Norfolk. For this marriage, Cradock gave her name as &quot;Phyllis Nan Sortain Vernon Evans&quot;.

The couple had a son, Christopher, but their marriage lasted less than a year before they separated. Cradock left her son Christopher and husband Arthur for a new life in central London. Christopher was brought up in Norfolk by his father, an aunt and grandmother, although he made contact with Fanny in his adult life. Arthur Chapman became a Catholic and so would not give Fanny the divorce she later requested, as it was against the church&#x27;s teachings. He was given only a single line in Fanny&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Something&#x27;s Burning&quot;.

Cradock married again on 26 September 1939 in Fulham, London, as &quot;Phyllis Nan Sortain Chapman&quot;; her husband this time was Gregory Holden-Dye, a daredevil minor racing driver, driving Bentleys at Brooklands in Surrey. The marriage lasted only eight weeks, and produced no children, as she had soon met the love of her life, Johnnie Cradock. Gregory&#x27;s mother had expressed a low opinion of Fanny, and ended up as a loathsome character in Fanny&#x27;s first novel &quot;Scorpion&#x27;s Suicide&quot;. Cradock later concluded that as Arthur Chapman had not granted her a divorce, her marriage to Gregory was not lawful, and so never publicised it.

John Whitby &quot;Johnnie&quot; Cradock was a major in the Royal Artillery who was already married with four children. He soon left his wife, Ethel, and children to be with Fanny. Unable to marry Johnnie, because of Arthur&#x27;s refusal to get divorced, she changed her surname to Cradock by deed poll in 1942. When she was misinformed that Arthur had died, she married Johnnie on 7 May 1977. (Arthur actually lived until 1978.) For this marriage Cradock went with a pared-down version of her name (&quot;Phyllis Chapman&quot;), and the then-68-year-old recorded her age as 55 on the marriage certificate, even though she had a son who was nearly fifty. Johnnie died in Basingstoke, Hampshire, on 30 January 1987.

==Death==
Cradock died following a stroke, on 27 December 1994, at the Ersham House Nursing Home, Hailsham, East Sussex. The cause of death was given as &#x27;cerebrovascular atherosclerosis&#x27;. She was cremated at Langney Crematorium, Eastbourne, as was Johnnie when he died in 1987. There is a memorial plaque and a rosebush in the grounds of the crematorium for both of them.

==Legacy==
Cradock came to the attention of the public in the postwar-utility years, trying to inspire the average housewife with an exotic approach to cooking. She worked in various ball-gowns without the customary cook&#x27;s apron, averring that women should feel cooking was easy and enjoyable, rather than messy and intimidating.

In her early anonymous role as a food critic, working with Johnnie under the name of &#x27;Bon Viveur&#x27;, Cradock introduced the public to unusual dishes from France and Italy, popularising the pizza in the United Kingdom. She and Johnnie worked together on a touring cookery show, sponsored by the Gas Council, to show how gas could be used easily in the kitchen and, as their fame increased, her shows transferred to television, where she enjoyed 20 years of success.

Cradock has also been credited in the UK as the originator of the prawn cocktail. However, some have suggested that she popularised her version of an established dish that was not well known until then in Britain. In their 1997 book &quot;The Prawn Cocktail Years&quot;, Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham note that the prawn cocktail has a &quot;direct lineage to Escoffier&quot;.

In the course of her shows, Cradock made frequent concessions to the economic realities of the era, suggesting cheaper alternatives which would be within reach of the housewife&#x27;s purse. The BBC published her recipes and suggestions for dinner-parties in a series of booklets, consolidating her reputation as the foremost celebrity chef of her day. Despite their extravagant appearance and eccentricity, her recipes were extremely widely used and her cookery books sold in record numbers.

Marguerite Patten has described Fanny Cradock as the saviour of British cooking after the war. Brian Turner has said that he respects Fanny&#x27;s career, and Delia Smith has attributed her own career to early inspirations taken from the Cradocks&#x27; television programmes. In a 2008 interview with &quot;The Daily Star&quot;, singer Amy Winehouse said that she discovered a love of cookery after reading Cradock&#x27;s books. Others are less complimentary. The BBC series &quot;The Way We Cooked&quot; featured an episode dedicated to Cradock, in which Graham Kerr, Keith Floyd and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, amongst others, disparaged her methods and cooking skills. In the third series of &quot;The F Word&quot;, Gordon Ramsay held a series-long search for a new Fanny Cradock.

==Media portrayals==
Fanny Cradock&#x27;s husky voice and theatrical style was ripe for mimicry, such as Betty Marsden&#x27;s &#x27;Fanny Haddock&#x27; in two BBC Radio comedy shows, &quot;Beyond Our Ken&quot; (1958–1964) and &quot;Round the Horne&quot; (1964–1968). Fanny and Johnnie were also parodied by &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; and on &quot;Benny Hill&quot;, with Hill as Fanny and Bob Todd as an invariably drunk Johnnie.

Cradock&#x27;s life has also been the subject of the plays &quot;Doughnuts Like Fanny&#x27;s&quot; by Julia Darling and &quot;Fear of Fanny&quot; by Brian Fillis. After a successful run by the Leeds Library Theatre Company, touring the United Kingdom in October and November 2003, &quot;Fear of Fanny&quot; was turned into a television drama starring Mark Gatiss and Julia Davis and featuring Hayley Atwell. The production broadcast in October 2006 on BBC Four as one of a series of culinary-themed dramas.

&quot;Sucking Shrimp&quot; by Stephanie Theobald has Fanny Cradock as one of its central characters. To provincial Cornish heroine Rosa Barge, Cradock represents glamour, sophistication and the life she aspires to in her concoctions of a Taj Mahal out of Italian meringue and duchesse potato dyed vivid green.

In 2019 the cabaret group &#x27;Duckie&#x27; staged &quot;Duckie Loves Fanny&quot; as part of the London Borough of Waltham Forest&#x27;s programme of events marking the locale&#x27;s year-long status as London Borough of Culture. Members of the cabaret group described their performance as a &quot;very queer mashup of postwar pop culture, style, food and gender politics in honour of the fearsome TV cook in her home area of Leytonstone&quot;.
