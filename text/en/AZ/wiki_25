<text>The angular aperture of a lens is the angular size of the lens aperture as seen from the focal point:

:formula_1

where 
:formula_2 is the focal length
:formula_3 is the diameter of the aperture.

== Relation to numerical aperture ==

In a medium with an index of refraction close to 1, such as air, the angular aperture is approximately equal to twice the numerical aperture of the lens.

Formally, the numerical aperture in air is:

:formula_4

In the paraxial approximation, with a small aperture, formula_5:

<text>Bathmochoffatia is an extinct mammal of the Upper Jurassic. It was a relatively early member of the also extinct order Multituberculata. It lived in Portugal at about the same time as the far more famous dinosaur, Allosaurus. It is in the suborder &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot;, family Paulchoffatiidae. The genus &quot;Bathmochoffatia&quot; (basal choffatia) was named by Hahn G. and Hahn R. in 1998.

The primary species, &quot;Bathmochoffatia hapax&quot;, was also named by Hahn and Hahn.
Fossil remains were found in strata dating to the Kimmeridgian (Upper Jurassic) of Guimarota, Portugal. Remains consist of a solitary molar and one cheek tooth.

<text>Carl Zeiss (; 11 September 1816 – 3 December 1888) was a German scientific instrument maker, optician and businessman. In 1846 he founded his workshop, which is still in business as Carl Zeiss AG. Zeiss gathered a group of gifted practical and theoretical opticians and glass makers to reshape most aspects of optical instrument production. His collaboration with Ernst Abbe revolutionized optical theory and practical design of microscopes. Their quest to extend these advances brought Otto Schott into the enterprises to revolutionize optical glass manufacture. The firm of Carl Zeiss grew to one of the largest and most respected optical firms in the world.

== Birth and family ==
Carl&#x27;s father, Johann Gottfried August Zeiss (1785–1849) was born in Rastenberg, where his forefathers had worked as artisans for over 100 years. August moved with his parents to Buttstädt, a small regional capital north of Weimar, where he married Johanna Antoinette Friederike Schmith (1786–1856). Carls Zeiss&#x27;s mother was related to Christiane Vulpius, the spouse of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.

August Zeiss then moved to Weimar, the capital of the grand duchy of Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach, leaving the family business in the hands of his brothers. There he became a well respected ornamental turner, crafting lathe turned work in mother of pearl, amber, ivory, and other exotic materials. He came into contact with the crown prince, and later grand duke, Karl Friedrich of Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach (1783–1853), the successor to Carl August. The crown prince sought a master to teach him ornamental turning and found one in August Zeiss. The friendship of master and apprentice lasted 40 years. When a son was born to the Zeiss family on 11 September 1816 as the fifth of six surviving children, the newborn son was baptized in honor of his godfather the crown prince and his father the archduke, Carl Friedrich. Of Zeiss&#x27;s siblings, three sisters and two brothers reached adulthood. Before 1885, the family name was spelled Zeiß.

== Education ==
Higher education was the only path to social mobility at the time and August Zeiss sent all three of his sons to the university preparatory high school, the &quot;Gymnasium&quot;, as preparation for the university. The two elder sons studied philology and history and went on to successful careers in education. In one of the accidents which shape history, Carl suffered from an inguinal hernia which required him to wear a truss constantly. The deskbound life of a scholar seemed a poor choice for him. Carl attended the Wilhelm Ernst Gymnasium in Weimar but left early. He sat a special end exam to allow him to study specific subjects at the university, principally the natural sciences.

He showed an interest in technical studies very early, to the extent that he attended lectures at the grand ducal technical school in Weimar and finally decided to pursue an apprenticeship as a master machinist.

Carl moved to Jena at Easter of 1834 to pursue an apprenticeship under the &quot;Hofmechanikus,&quot; court-appointed precision machinist, and private docent at the University of Jena, Friedrich Körner (1778–1847). His new master was well known beyond his local university town and his workshop is fairly well documented since he made and repaired instruments for the famous polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Zeiss remained for four years as an apprentice. For the last two years, he enrolled as a student and attended one mathematics or sciences lecture course per semester at the university, as was his right under his gymnasium certificate. He completed his apprenticeship in 1838 and departed on his journeyman years with the good wishes and recommendation of master Körner and a certificate of his studies at the university.

This was a time when the steam engine and locomotives exercised a powerful draw on young engineers so it is understandable that Carl Zeiss turned his special attention to mechanical engineering. In his travels from 1838 to 1845 he worked in Stuttgart, Darmstadt, Vienna and Berlin. There are few details of these studies, but it appears that he worked for Hektor Rössler, instrument maker and &quot;Hofmechanikus&quot; at Darmstadt. Rössler was involved in optical and scientific instrument production as well as steam power. In Vienna, the center for heavy machinery production in central Europe, he worked for Rollé und Schwilqué. His stay in Vienna also offered the opportunity to attend the Sunday Lectures on popular mechanics at the Polytechnic Institute of Vienna. He also sat for an exam at the institute which he passed with distinction. Finally, in Berlin, he worked in a machinist&#x27;s shop.

== Establishment of the workshop for precision machinery and optics. Early years in Jena. ==
After long deliberation Zeiss decided to return to his original subject studied under Körner, construction of experimental scientific apparatus, and set himself up as an independent maker of precision machinery. Zeiss returned to the well known city of Jena to renew an association with the botanist Matthias Jacob Schleiden (1804–1881) who had stimulated his original interest in optics and emphasized the need for high quality microscopes. In addition, his brother Eduard directed the local public school in Jena and had kept him informed on developments in the city.

Realization of the plan required considerable patience in the face of the bureaucracy of the time. He first needed a residence permit, which was easiest to obtain as a matriculated student. Zeiss matriculated and sat lectures on mathematics and chemistry beginning in November 1845. In addition he worked with several professors in the private physiological institute as a technician, building various apparatuses. There was plenty of work despite the fact that there were already two instrument workshops in Jena. In addition to Körner&#x27;s there was the workshop of Braunau, who had also apprenticed with Körner.

Zeiss finally made his application to the government offices in Weimar for a concession to establish a machinist&#x27;s atelier in Jena on 10 May 1846. He referred to the increasing demand for scientific apparatus and justified his wish to work in the city with the importance of intimate association with the scientists of the university.

Despite the recommendation of respected professors of the University of Jena, the government in Weimar moved slowly with the request. Zeiss was required to sit a written exam in August and finally, in November, received his &quot;concession for the construction and sale of mechanical and optical apparatus as well as the establishment of an atelier for precision machinery in Jena.&quot; After payment of a fee and swearing a ceremonial oath before the Jena authorities, everything was ready.

Zeiss opened the doors of his workshop on 17 November 1846 with an initial capital investment of 100 Talers, which he had borrowed from his brother Eduard and which was later repaid by his father August. By 1849, the workshop earned a profit of 197 Talers on sales of 901 Talers. Zeiss initially worked alone constructing and repairing many types of physical and chemical apparatus. Loupes cut from mirror blanks were particularly in demand. Eyeglasses, telescopes, microscopes, drawing instruments, thermometers, barometers, balances, glassblowing accessories and other apparatuses purchased from foreign suppliers were also sold in a small shop.

In 1847 he began to make simple microscopes which almost immediately met with especially good commercial success. Compared to his competition Vincent Chevalier of Paris, Simon Plössl of Vienna or his mentor Körner, they proved to be not only cheaper, but better. Zeiss microscopes could be focused by moving the column that carried the optics, instead of the object stage. Zeiss&#x27;s method was more convenient on a dissecting microscope.

Business was so good that he was able to hire an assistant and move to a larger workshop by early 1847. On 1 July 1847 Zeiss took the significant step of taking on his first apprentice, 17 year old August Löber (1830–1912). Löber became one of the most important workers in the Zeiss workshops, becoming a profit sharing partner and staying with Zeiss until his death. A total of 27 simple microscopes were delivered to customers beyond the borders of the grand duchy in 1847. Three difficult years followed with poor harvests, business crisis and revolution in the grand duchy, but by 1850, Zeiss and his microscopes had established a good enough reputation to receive an attractive offer from the University of Greifswald in Prussia. The university&#x27;s instrument maker Nobert had moved and Zeiss was asked by several members of the faculty to fill the vacancy with an appointment as curator of the physics cabinet with a salary of 200 Talers. Nothing came of the offer, and Zeiss was to remain in Jena for better or worse, when an influential mathematician maintained that such a position should not be filled by a &quot;foreigner.&quot;

His sister Pauline kept the household in Jena until Carl Zeiss married a pastor&#x27;s daughter Bertha Schatter (1827–1850) on 29 May 1849. She died giving birth to his first son in February of the following year. Roderich survived to eventually join his father in the family firm. In May 1853 Zeiss married Ottilie Trinkler, a headmaster&#x27;s daughter. They had one son, Karl Otto (1854–1925) and two daughters, Hedwig (1856–1935) and Sidonie (1861–1920).

== Carl Zeiss as an employer ==
Zeiss ran his workshop in a strict paternalistic fashion. Microscopes produced by the apprentices which did not meet the strict standards of precision he set were destroyed on the workshop anvil personally by Zeiss. The working hours of the shop were 6 AM until 7 PM. A mid morning break of 15 minutes and a midday break of an hour made for an 11 ¾ hours workday. Despite these strict rules, the working environment in the shop was very good. New recruits to the workshop were interviewed extensively in his home over a glass of wine. The workers were often invited to the gardens of the Zeiss home for wine and refreshments and the workshop paid for the yearly worker&#x27;s outing to the hills in the hay wagon. His longest serving apprentice Löber earned three Talers per week by 1856 while the other workers earned two and a half.

Zeiss&#x27;s efforts at improving his knowledge of precision machining and optics meant that a substantial library of books accumulated. These became the machinist&#x27;s library, available for the further education of any worker.

As the firm expanded, by 1875 the Zeiss health clinic was established, which guaranteed employees free treatment by a clinic doctor and free access to medication. If a worker was unable to work, wages were paid for six weeks with a further six weeks at half wages. These forward thinking policies even precede Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s state welfare laws introduced in 1883. Worker morale at the Zeiss works was consistently good.

== Improvements of the microscope ==
Production of microscopes in 1846 was a handcraft and art more than manufacturing enterprise. Each worker produced an instrument from start to finish without any division of labor. Early examples were even signed with the maker&#x27;s name. Only such assemblies which were particularly time-consuming, such as the stage, were prepared in series in advance. The first moves to more efficient division of labor were made in 1857 when Zeiss separated optics under Löber from the metalwork of the stand.

Matthias Jakob Schleiden had been an interested patron and advisor since the founding of the firm, frequently spending hours at the workshops. He advised Zeiss to concentrate his efforts on the microscope which was critical for the rapidly advancing science of cellular anatomy and very much in demand. Schleiden had a personal interest as this was his field of study. As a result of the interaction, the first microscopes products of the workshop, the simple microscopes, were constantly improved. They were very favorably reviewed by the influential microscopist and botanist Leopold Dippel (1827–1914). The optics for the simple microscope included a triplet of 200 fold magnification, for 5 Talers, and one of 300 fold magnification, for 8 Taler. These pushed the limits of the simple microscope. Greater magnification would require compound microscopes. Zeiss would need to expand his offerings so as not to be made irrelevant by his competitors.

Production of compound microscopes required extensive research, which he had foreseen long in advance. Zeiss had developed into something of a bookworm in his limited spare time, researching everything available on theory of the microscope. He wanted, above all, to move past the prevailing methods of microscope production which relied on empirical matching of sets of lenses which would make up the high-magnification compound lenses he needed for compound microscope optics. Empirical methods used a selection of lenses, exchanging and examining elements, altering lens spacings again and again until a usable lens was obtained. Many dozens of lenses could be examined to produce the combination of three elements used in a microscope lens. A reasonably good lens obtained this way was altered and tried again and again to find the best result. To some extent, these designs could be reproduced, but each item was an empirical fit of the small elements which could not be reproduced exactly with the work methods used.

Zeiss was, from the beginning, more a fine machinist than an optician. This meant that he was less constrained by the traditional work methods and thinking of contemporary opticians and more open to innovation. He decided to pursue the design of microscope optics by theoretical calculation, which expert opinion considered impossible for various reasons. Despite that opinion, Joseph von Fraunhofer (1787–1826) had already produced telescope objectives by calculation in 1819, and Josef Maximilian Petzval had done the same for the camera objective in Vienna with Johann Friedrich Voigtländer in 1840. Zeiss had already attempted to acquire the required theory in his evening literature studies. When this failed, he turned to the Jena professor of mathematics, Friedrich Wilhelm Barfuss, who had worked with his mentor Körner and had already worked successfully on the problem of Zeiss&#x27;s simple microscope triplets. The collaboration continued until the professor&#x27;s death, but offered no progress on the compound microscope problem.

Zeiss&#x27;s first compound microscopes were offered in his 5th, 1858, price list. These are described as &quot;Small body tube, consisting of a field lens and two oculars with an adaptor to attach the tube to the stand and doublet objectives of stands 1 through 5 to allow use of the doublets as objectives to obtain two stronger magnifications after the fashion of the compound microscope. The 120 power doublet of the simple microscope yields in this fashion 300 and 600 fold magnification.&quot;

Despite Schleiden&#x27;s approval, these improvised compound microscopes were not a long-term solution. A similar arrangement, as a Brücke&#x27;s Loupe, continued to be offered for many years with the dissecting stands but the original simple microscope doublets were an inferior substitute for a purpose designed compound microscope achromatic objective. By the publication of the 7th, 1861, price list in August 1861, newly developed compound microscopes appear in 5 different versions. The largest of these, costing 55 Taler, was a horseshoe foot stand as made popular by the well known Parisian microscope maker Georg Oberhaeuser. Under the object stage Zeiss introduced a domed aperture plate and a mirror mounted to allow not only side to side, but also forward movement to produce oblique illumination. Each microscope suite was produced to order for his customers so that they could choose their preferred optical components; objectives, oculars and illumination.

The objectives for these new compound microscopes were still empirically design but nonetheless met with immediate approval from Leopold Dippel. Dippel examined the optical quality of the most useful objectives, A, C, D and F and had considerable praise for Zeiss&#x27;s new objectives. The D objective was compared very favorably with the similar power objectives of Belthle and Hartnack (successor to Oberhaeuser). The F objective is even described as the equal of much more expensive objectives from established makers. It is assessed as almost as good as Hartnack&#x27;s water immersion objectives. That was, of course the problem. When selling to researchers at the forefront of their fields, &quot;almost as good&quot; is a commercial disaster. Zeiss knew quite well that his strongest objectives could not match the quality of the Hartnack water immersion objectives. Every attempt to empirically design a satisfactory water immersion objective had failed.

== Collaboration with Ernst Abbe ==

To solve his problem Zeiss returned to his original plans to design his objectives based on a calculated theoretical basis. He renewed his search for a collaborator and this time chose Ernst Abbe (1840–1905), a private docent, or associate professor, at the university. The official collaboration between the 50 year old Zeiss and 26 year old Abbe began in July 1866 with the goal of the creation of a water immersion objective with resolution equal to those of Emil Hartnack&#x27;s.

A first step in the rational production of optics was a modernization of the workshop methods. This was accomplished with some resistance from Löber and the other employees who preferred to remain with their traditional methods. The plan was to measure every individual property of each lens element before an objective was constructed to allow precise reproduction of the optical system. The D objective, for example contained 5 lenses. Each was composed of glass with a specific index of refraction, with exact curvatures, of a specific focal length and exact spacings. Löber had already investigated one requirement using glass reference gauges to compare the curvature of lens surfaces using the phenomenon of Newton&#x27;s rings. Fraunhofer had arrived at the same solution long before but the procedure had remained a trade secret of his workshop. Abbe constructed a series of new measuring apparatus to measure focal lengths and refractive indices. The result of all of this effort was clear by 1869. Outwardly the microscopes had hardly changed, but due to the rationalization of the work flow more microscopes were produced with the same personnel. Prices were reduced by 25%.

Abbe could now proceed with the actual task, namely calculation of the theoretical objective designs. Zeiss provided him every possible support from the workshop and the assistance of the most capable worker of the workshop, namely August Löber. Despite this, there were many obstacles to overcome. It was 1872 before the work was complete. Abbe had recalculated the existing A through F objectives for systematic production and added four new, larger aperture, objectives AA through DD in this series. Most important, he added three water immersion objectives with resolution and image quality equalling anything available from Hartnack, Gundlach or other competitors. In catalog number 19, Microscopes and Microscopical Accessories, it was announced that, &quot;The microscope systems presented here are all constructed on the basis on the recent theoretical calculations of Professor Ernst Abbe of Jena.&quot; They were no longer surpassed by any competitor&#x27;s products. This was also reflected in the prices. While the best microscope cost 127 Taler in 1871, in 1872 one paid 387 Taler for the top of the line. Despite this, business remained brisk and the new objective system garnered high praise at a conference of natural scientists and physicians in Leipzig.

Zeiss repaid Abbe for his endeavor with a generous profit sharing arrangement in the workshops and made him a partner in 1875. As one condition of his financial participation Abbe was obligated not to expand his responsibilities at the university further. The optical calculations were specifically regarded as property of the firm and not to be published, contradicting Abbe&#x27;s original plans.

== Expansion of the workshop into a major concern ==
On 14 October 1876 the completion of the 3,000th microscope was celebrated and the staff had grown to 60 employees. That same year Zeiss&#x27;s son Roderich joined the firm, assuming commercial and administrative duties and becoming a partner in 1879. In addition Roderich made important contributions in the design of microphotographic apparatus. Carl Zeiss remained active in the firm on a daily basis. In recognition of his contributions Carl was awarded an honorary doctorate by the faculty of the university of Jena in 1880 at the recommendation of a long-term collaborator, the zoologist Prof. Ernst Häckel.

A move to modernization and enlargement of the firm was encouraged by Ernst Abbe, while Zeiss remained somewhat more conservative based on the many setbacks he had experienced. Nonetheless, by the 1880s the transition to large scale operations was underway.

By 1883 the firm was enjoying solid business success. The firm published its catalog No 26 as an illustrated and bound volume of 80 pages in an edition of 5,000 copies. The always thrifty Zeiss required retailers to share the cost of three or four silver groschen per copy. The firm&#x27;s retailer in London, Baker, often ordered 40 or more objectives at a time. The firm even began opening field offices in and outside the country.

== Optical glass ==
After mastering the problem of producing objectives based on theoretical calculation one problem remained, namely the production of suitable optical glass. At the time optical glass was obtained from England, France or Switzerland and left much to be desired in quality, reliable availability, selection of optical properties and prompt delivery. The optical properties were not consistent from batch to batch and, as important, those glasses which could be obtained were not ideal for the properties calculated to give the best correction in a microscope objective.

Abbe and Zeiss were convinced that the optical qualities of the microscope objective could be improved further if glasses with certain properties could be obtained. Unfortunately, no such glasses existed. Zeiss once again supported Abbe in his theoretical work with the resources of the workshop to produce objectives using liquids in lens triplets to test his theory by 1873, known as polyop objectives in the workshop. Liquid lens triplets were not a new idea. David Brewster describes them in his Treatise on the Microscope of 1837 for the Encyclopædia Britannica. They allow access to several optical properties which are not accessible in glasses. Unfortunately, they are not commercially viable. These expensive and commercially useless experiments proved that Abbe&#x27;s prediction was correct. Superior optical corrections were possible. Abbe and Zeiss&#x27;s 1872 series of objectives, including the water immersion objectives, were as good as anything made at the time. For the first time, these objectives were better than anything made anywhere. This result provided the argument for developing new glasses.

Abbe discussed the problem of expanding the range of properties of optical glasses with the major producers with no success, but he continued to search for a way forward. Zeiss and Abbe responded very enthusiastically to the enquiries of the chemist and glass technician Otto Schott when Schott contacted Abbe to seek help characterizing new chemical compositions in glasses. Schott was uniquely skilled at producing small batches of experimental glass compositions in high quality. He was convinced to move to Jena and expand his experiments. After demonstrating dozens of successful experiments, Zeiss used his credibility and connections to obtain financial support from the Prussian government for the efforts. Within two years of the establishment of a glassworks in Jena, Zeiss, Abbe and Schott could offer dozens of well characterized optical glasses with repeatable composition and on large scale. The firm still operates as Schott AG.

In the same publications announcing the Schott glassworks line of products, Zeiss announced a new set of objectives, based on Abbe&#x27;s work, corrected to a higher standard than any existing lenses. The apochromatic objectives represented the success of collaborations lasting almost two decades.

== Later years and death ==
In December 1885 Zeiss suffered a mild stroke, from which he fully recovered. The grand duke enrolled him in the Order of the White Falcon for his 70th birthday in 1886, the same year the apochromatic objectives appeared on the market. These represented the final realization of the grand design for the theoretical design of objectives inspired by and made possible by Zeiss and realized by Abbe; they delivered previously unknown image quality. The members of the congress of Russian physicians were so inspired by the new objectives that they made Zeiss an honorary member.

Zeiss was able to attend the celebration on the occasion of the completion of the 10,000th microscope on 24 September 1886, to which all employees and their spouses were invited. It was a lavish party remembered in Jena for decades. Zeiss suffered a rapid decline and, after several strokes in the last quarter of 1888, died on 3 December 1888. Zeiss is buried in Jena.In final analysis of the contributions of Carl Zeiss one must conclude that, although he introduced several improvements in the mechanics of the microscope, he did not personally introduce groundbreaking innovations. His critical contributions were his insistence on the greatest precision in his own work and in the products of his employees and that he maintained from the beginning close contacts with the scientists who gave him valuable insights for the design of his microscopes.

The greatest contribution of Zeiss was in his steadfast pursuit of his idea to produce microscope objectives based on theory, even when his own efforts and those of Barfuss had failed. Even though the final task was accomplished by Abbe and not himself, one must still credit Zeiss with awakening Abbe&#x27;s interest in optics and providing every conceivable personal, material and financial support for the enormous task. The production of an objective based on theoretical design was only possible with skilled artisans trained to work with the highest possible precision, upon which Zeiss had always placed the greatest emphasis.

One final accomplishment was guiding the internal reorganization and transformations of a workshop into a major enterprise. Only this transformation made it possible to produce microscopes in large numbers with highest precision. The driving force behind the expansion was Ernst Abbe, but Zeiss had the final say and supported the efforts to the fullest. Competing workshops which did not embrace the calculation of optical systems and the transition to major enterprises were doomed to fail.

Ernst Abbe honored the contributions of Carl Zeiss in several major speeches and created a memorial with the foundation of the Carl Zeiss Foundation, Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung, which still endures today.

<text>Carl Zeiss AG ( , ), branded as ZEISS, is a German manufacturer of optical systems and optoelectronics, founded in Jena, Germany in 1846 by optician Carl Zeiss. Together with Ernst Abbe (joined 1866) and Otto Schott (joined 1884) he laid the foundation for today&#x27;s multinational company. The current company emerged from a reunification of Carl Zeiss companies in East and West Germany with a consolidation phase in the 1990s. ZEISS is active in four business segments with approximately equal revenue (Industrial Quality and Research, Medical Technology, Consumer Markets and Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology) in almost 50 countries, has 30 production sites and around 25 development sites worldwide.

Carl Zeiss AG is the holding of all subsidiaries within Zeiss Group, of which Carl Zeiss Meditec AG is the only one that is traded at the stock market. Carl Zeiss AG is owned by the foundation Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung. The Zeiss Group has its headquarters in southern Germany, in the small town of Oberkochen, with its second largest, and founding site, being Jena in eastern Germany. Also controlled by the Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung is the glass manufacturer Schott AG, located in Mainz and Jena. Carl Zeiss is one of the oldest existing optics manufacturers in the world.

== Corporate history ==


Carl Zeiss opened an optics workshop in Jena in 1846. By 1847 he was making microscopes full-time. In 1861 the rapidly growing company had a staff of about 20 and won a gold medal at the Thuringian Industrial Exposition.
By 1866 Zeiss sold their 1,000th microscope. In 1872 physicist Ernst Abbe joined Zeiss, and along with Otto Schott designed greatly improved lenses for the optical instruments they were producing. After Carl Zeiss&#x27;s death in 1888, the business was incorporated as the in 1889.

By World War I, Zeiss was the world&#x27;s largest camera-production company. Zeiss Ikon represented a significant part of the production, along with dozens of other brands and factories, including a major works at Dresden.

In 1928 the Zeiss company acquired Hensoldt AG, which has produced Zeiss binoculars and rifle-scopes since 1964 - this has occasionally resulted in twin products being offered under both the &quot;Hensoldt&quot; and &quot;Zeiss&quot; brand-names. The Hensoldt System Technology division (resulting from a merger of the military-optics operations of Leica and Hensoldt) was continued by Zeiss under the &quot;Hensoldt&quot; name until 2006.

As part of Nazi Germany&#x27;s program, Zeiss used forced labour, including Jews and other minorities during World War II. The destruction of the war caused many companies to divide into smaller subcompanies and others to merge. There was great respect for the engineering innovation that came out of Dresden—before the war the world&#x27;s first 35 mm single-lens reflex camera, the &quot;Kine Exakta&quot;, and the first miniature camera with good picture-quality were developed there.

At the end of the war, Jena was initially occupied by the United States Army. When Jena and Dresden were incorporated into the Soviet occupation zone, later East Germany, the US Army relocated some parts of Zeiss Jena to the Contessa manufacturing facility in Stuttgart, West Germany, while the remainder of Zeiss Jena was reestablished by the (eastern) German Democratic Republic as . The Soviet Army relocated most of the existing Zeiss factories and tooling to the Soviet Union, establishing the Kiev camera-works.

In the West, business activity restarted in Oberkochen in present-day Baden-Württemberg (southwestern Germany) as in 1946, which became in 1947, but was soon renamed to &quot;Carl Zeiss&quot;. West-German Zeiss products were labelled &quot;Opton&quot; for sale in the Eastern bloc, while East German Zeiss products were labelled &quot; or simply &quot; for sale in Western countries.

In 1973, the Western Carl Zeiss AG entered into a licensing agreement with the Japanese camera-company Yashica to produce a series of high-quality 35 mm film-cameras and lenses bearing the Contax and Zeiss brand names. This collaboration continued under Yashica&#x27;s successor, Kyocera, until the latter ceased all camera production in 2005. Zeiss later produced lenses for the space industry and, more recently, has again produced high-quality 35 mm camera-lenses. The eastern Zeiss Jena was also well known for producing high-quality products.

Following the German reunification of 1989–1991,  — reckoned as one of the few East-German firms that was even potentially able to compete on a global basis — became , which became in 1990. In 1991, was split in two, with taking over the company&#x27;s divisions for microscopy and other precision optics (effectively reuniting the pre-war Carl Zeiss enterprise) and moving its microscopy and planetarium divisions back to Jena. Jenoptik GmbH was split off as a specialty company in the areas of photonics, optoelectronics, and mechatronics.

The Hensoldt AG was renamed &quot;Carl Zeiss Sports Optics GmbH&quot; on 1 October 2006.

The companies of the in and around Dresden have branched into new technologies: screens and products for the automotive industry, for example.

 there are arguably three companies with primarily &quot;Zeiss Ikon&quot; heritage: , the Finnish/Swedish (which bought the West German ), and the independent eastern .

A division called &quot;Carl Zeiss Vision&quot; produces lenses for eyeglasses. In 2005, the eyeglass division merged with U.S. company SOLA, which included the former American Optical Company.

On 28 June 2013, Carl Zeiss officially announced its plan to rename the brand from &quot; to simply &quot;. All the products will be standardized under the &quot;Zeiss&quot; brand.

In April 2019, Zeiss announced the acquisition of Brunswick-based GOM.

== Innovations ==
The Zeiss company was responsible for many innovations in optical design and engineering in each of their major fields of business. Today this becomes exemplarily visible in the latest EUV lithography systems, the equipment needed to produce the latest generations of semiconductor components. It also includes early high-performance optical microscopes up to today&#x27;s electron and ion microscopes, which reach a sub-nanometers resolution. It includes technology leadership in the first surgical microscopes and ophthalmic devices. It also includes high-performance contact metrology systems. For many years Zeiss showed innovations in fields as astronomical telescopes, photographic and cinematic lenses.

Early on, Carl Zeiss realised that he needed a competent scientist so as to take the firm beyond just being another optical workshop. In 1866, the service of Dr. Ernst Abbe was enlisted. From then on novel products appeared in rapid succession which brought the Zeiss company to the forefront of optical technology.

Abbe was instrumental in the development of the famous Jena optical glass. When he was trying to eliminate stigmatism from microscopes, he realized that the range of optical glasses available was insufficient. After some calculations, he realised that performance of optical instruments would dramatically improve if optical glasses of appropriate properties were available. His challenge to glass manufacturers was finally answered by Dr. Otto Schott, who established the famous glassworks at Jena from which new types of optical glass began to appear from 1888 to be employed by Zeiss and other makers.

The new Jena optical glass also opened up the possibility of increased performance of photographic lenses. The first use of Jena glass in a photographic lens was by Voigtländer, but as the lens was an old design its performance was not greatly improved. Subsequently, the new glasses would demonstrate their value in correcting astigmatism, and in the production of apochromatic lenses. Abbe started the design of a photographic lens of symmetrical design with five elements, but went no further.

Zeiss&#x27; domination of photographic lens innovation was due to Dr Paul Rudolph. In 1890, Rudolph designed an asymmetrical lens with a cemented group at each side of the diaphragm, appropriately named &quot;Anastigmat&quot;. This lens was made in three series: Series III, IV and V, with maximum apertures of f/7.2, f/12.5, and f/18 respectively. In 1891, Series I, II and IIIa appeared with respective maximum apertures of f/4.5, f/6.3, and f/9 and in 1893 came Series IIa of f/8 maximum aperture. These lenses are now better known by the trademark &quot;Protar&quot;, which was first used in 1900.

At the time, single combination lenses, which occupy one side of the diaphragm only, were still popular. Rudolph designed one with three cemented elements in 1893, with the option of fitting two of them together in a lens barrel as a compound lens, but it was found to be the same as the Dagor by C.P. Goerz, designed by Emil von Hoegh. Rudolph then came up with a single combination with four cemented elements, which can be considered as having all the elements of the Protar stuck together in one piece. Marketed in 1894, it was called the Protarlinse Series VII, the most highly corrected single combination lens with maximum apertures between f/11 and f/12.5, depending on its focal length.

But the important thing about this Protarlinse is that two of these lens units can be mounted in the same lens barrel to form a compound lens of even greater performance and a larger aperture, between f/6.3 and f/7.7. In this configuration, it was called the Double Protar Series VIIa. An immense range of focal lengths can thus be obtained by the various combination of Protarlinse units.

Rudolph also investigated the Double-Gauss concept of a symmetrical design with thin positive menisci enclosing negative elements. The result was the Planar Series Ia of 1896, with maximum apertures up to f/3.5, one of the fastest lenses of its time. Whilst it was very sharp, it suffered from coma which limited its popularity. However, further developments of this configuration made it the design of choice for high-speed lenses of standard coverage.

Probably inspired by the Stigmatic lenses designed by Hugh Aldis for Dallmeyer of London, Rudolph designed a new asymmetrical lens with four thin elements, the Unar Series Ib, with apertures up to f/4.5. Due to its high speed, it was used extensively on hand cameras.

The most important Zeiss lens by Rudolph was the Tessar, first sold in 1902 in its Series IIb f/6.3 form. It can be said as a combination of the front half of the Unar with the rear half of the Protar. This proved to be the most valuable and flexible design, with tremendous development potential. Its maximum aperture was increased to f/4.7 in 1917 and reached f/2.7 in 1930. It is probable that every lens manufacturer has produced lenses of the Tessar configurations.

Rudolph left Zeiss after World War I, but many other competent designers such as Merté, Wandersleb, etc. kept the firm at the leading edge of photographic lens innovations. One of the most significant designers was the ex-Ernemann man Dr Ludwig Bertele, famed for his Ernostar high-speed lens.

With the advent of the Contax by Zeiss-Ikon, the first professional 35mm system camera became available. At this stage the Leica was no more than a convenient and portable snapshot camera. However Leitz could see the potential offered by the Contax and rapidly developed a coupled rangefinder and started to introduce additional lenses. As a system camera there was a need for a range of lenses for the Contax. Bertele&#x27;s Sonnar series of lenses designed for the Contax was the match in every respect for the Leica for at least two decades. Other lenses for the Contax included the Biotar, Biogon, Orthometar, and various Tessars and Triotars.

The last important Zeiss innovation before World War II was the technique of applying an anti-reflective coating to lens surfaces invented by Olexander Smakula in 1935. A lens so treated was marked with a red &quot;T&quot;, short for &quot;Transparent&quot;. The technique of applying multiple layers of coatings was developed from this basis after the war, and known as &quot;T✻&quot; (T-star).
After the partitioning of Germany, a new Carl Zeiss optical company was established in Oberkochen, while the original Zeiss firm in Jena continued to operate. At first, both firms produced very similar lines of products, and extensively cooperated in product-sharing, but they drifted apart as time progressed. Jena&#x27;s new direction was to concentrate on developing lenses for 35 mm single-lens reflex cameras, and many achievements were made, especially in ultra-wide angle designs. In addition to that, Oberkochen also worked on designing lenses for the 35 mm single-lens reflex camera Contarex, for the medium format camera Hasselblad, for large format cameras like the Linhof Technika, interchangeable front element lenses such as for the 35 mm single-lens reflex Contaflex and other types of cameras.

Since the beginning of Zeiss as a photographic lens manufacturer, it has had a licensing programme, allowing other manufacturers to produce its lenses. Over the years its licensees included Voigtländer, Bausch &amp; Lomb, Ross, Koristka, Krauss, Kodak. etc. In the 1970s, the western operation of Zeiss-Ikon collaborated with Yashica to produce the new Contax cameras, and many of the Zeiss lenses for this camera, among others, were produced by Yashica&#x27;s optical arm, Tomioka. As Yashica&#x27;s owner Kyocera ended camera production in 2006, and Yashica lenses were then made by Cosina, who also manufactured most of the new Zeiss designs for the new Zeiss Ikon coupled rangefinder camera. Another licensee active today is Sony who uses the Zeiss name on lenses on its video and digital still cameras.

== Business relationships ==

Zeiss has licensed its name or technology to various other companies including Hasselblad, Rollei, Yashica, Sony, Logitech and Alpa. The nature of the collaboration varies, from co-branding optics designed by another firm (e.g., Sony) to complete optical design and manufacturing (e.g., Hasselblad).

On 27 April 2005, the company announced a collaboration with Nokia in the camera phone market, with Zeiss providing camera optics. The first smartphone to be co-engineered with Zeiss optics was the Nokia N90, Zeiss will again provide optics for Nokia products through a collaboration with HMD Global announced on 6 July 2017.

On 17 December 2020, Vivo and Zeiss announced a long-term strategic partnership to jointly promote and develop breakthrough innovations in mobile imaging technology. The first “Vivo Zeiss co-engineered imaging system” will be featured in the Vivo X60 series, followed by Vivo X-Fold 3 Pro, and lowered to their V-series. As part of the collaboration agreement, Vivo and Zeiss will establish the Vivo Zeiss Imaging Lab, a joint R&amp;D program to innovate mobile imaging technology for Vivo’s flagship smartphones.
== Zeiss cameras ==
=== Zeiss Ikon film cameras ===

Zeiss Ikon was an independent camera company related to Carl Zeiss, formed by the merger of four camera makers (Contessa-Nettel, Ernemann, Goerz and ICA) in Dresden on September 15, 1926. Much of the capital came from Zeiss which also provided components for the cameras, including lenses and shutters through its subsidiaries such as Deckel. One of the four merged companies, (ICA AG), had been founded in 1909 shortly after Carl Zeiss Palmos, which had been co-founded by Zeiss lens designer Paul Rudolph and Curt Bentzin from Görlitz in 1899, went out of business. Another founding company, Contessa-Nettel, was operated by August Nagel, who left the company in 1928 to form the Nagel Works; in 1932, his company was bought by Kodak, which continued to produce cameras in Germany under the Retina brand.
The earliest Zeiss Ikon cameras were a range of medium and large format folding cameras badged as &quot;Nettar&quot;, &quot;Ikonta&quot;, and &quot;Super Ikonta&quot;, for film and glass plate photography. The most expensive was the &quot;Universal Juwel&quot; (Jewel), a glass plate camera originally designed by ICA in 1909. This was a favorite of both Ansel Adams and Dorothea Lange. Other models produced by Zeiss Ikon prior to World War II included the &quot;Baldur&quot;, named for Baldur von Schirach; the &quot;Contaflex&quot;, a twin-lens reflex; and the &quot;Tengor&quot;, a box camera derived from an earlier Goerz design. Despite German production, the folding Super Ikonta was among the mainstays of British Army photographers during World War II.

In 1932 Zeiss Ikon introduced the Contax line of 35mm rangefinder cameras, having recognised the potential for a system camera using 35mm film. The Contax I was introduced with a wide range of lenses and accessories for scientific and professional use. In 1936, an improved model, the Contax II, was introduced and became the favorite of many renowned photographers and journalists, including Robert Capa and Margaret Bourke-White. A second 35mm camera, the Contax III, was mechanically identical with a light meter grafted to the top of the camera.
After World War II, the Dresden factory was dismantled and the Soviet Union forcibly relocated the Contax factory to Kiev as war reparations, where the pre-war Contax II and III camera designs were produced under the Kiev brand. The first Kiev cameras were identical except for logos.

The United States also relocated Zeiss from Jena to Heidenheim (Oberkochen) in 1945, but Zeiss Ikon were without designs or facilities for making the Contax and set about producing an improved replacement. These were named the Contax IIa and IIIa, and were smaller and lighter than the original designs. But by the time the IIa and IIIa hit the market, they faced strong competition from many European and Asian brands, notably the visually similar Nikon produced by Nippon Kogaku, which was a high quality camera sharing the same lens-mount and most of the features. Zeiss Ikon prevented some European distribution under the theory that &quot;Nikon&quot; was an infringement on their brand name.

Starting in the mid-1950s, Zeiss Ikon shifted its focus to market single-lens reflex cameras in three distinct lines: the Contaflex line (1953) for amateurs with leaf shutters, the high-end Contarex line (1959) with film magazine backs and superb optics, and the mid-range Icarex line (1967) with focal plane shutters and either the popular M42 lens mount or a proprietary bayonet mount. While these designs were initially competitive with SLRs produced by Japanese brands including Canon, Yashica, Minolta, and Nikon, Zeiss Ikon failed to keep pace by adding features and Zeiss Ikon camera production ceased in 1971.

===Voigtländer===
Zeiss also acquired the Voigtländer brand in 1956, putting it in the curious position of offering competing cameras in the same market segments, including professional rangefinders (Prominent (135), in competition with the Contax), amateur SLRs (Bessamatic/Ultramatic, competing with the Contaflex), and numerous compact and folding cameras through at least 1967, when the Icarex, a Voigtländer design released under the Zeiss Ikon brand, was released to consolidate the competing SLR lines.

After Zeiss Ikon stopped producing cameras, the Voigtländer brand and Icarex designs were acquired by Rollei, which released variations of the Icarex under both Voigtländer and Rollei as the Rolleiflex SL35 M.
===Cameras produced under Zeiss licenses===

Since 1972, some 35mm cameras have been marketed under the &quot;Contax&quot; and &quot;Zeiss Ikon&quot; brands. The &quot;Contax&quot; brand was licensed to Yashica in 1974, which later was acquired by Kyocera; Contax marketed several lines of SLR, rangefinder, compact, and digital cameras with Zeiss lenses and Japanese-built bodies. The most recent &quot;Zeiss Ikon&quot; rangefinder camera was an M mount camera with automatic exposure, introduced by Zeiss in 2004 and manufactured in Japan by Cosina; it was discontinued in 2012.

===ZX1 digital===
The Zeiss ZX1 full-frame 35mm F/2 large-sensor compact camera was announced during Photokina 2018 with the slogan &#x27;Shoot – Edit – Share&#x27;. The camera incorporates Adobe Lightroom Mobile editing capacities, and an internal 512GB SSD affording 6,800 DNG-format RAW images or 50,000 JPEG-format compressed images. The ZX1, which was one of only a few cameras to use the Android operating system, was discontinued in 2023.

== Camera lenses ==
=== Cinema lenses ===
Carl Zeiss AG has long been renowned for its motion picture lenses. Zeiss manufactures prime and zoom lenses for 35mm, 16mm, and 65mm film production. They also make lenses for digital cinema and high definition video. Zeiss is mainly known in the trade for their association with the German camera manufacturer Arri for whom they currently produce lenses.

=== ZM lenses ===
Zeiss ZM lenses fit Leica M mount cameras, including Leica M series, the Ricoh GXR A12, and many mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras through the use of adapters. Some ZM lenses are manufactured in Germany by Zeiss, others in Japan by Cosina. Lenses designated &quot;C&quot; are considered &quot;compact&quot; or &quot;classic&quot; lenses.
* Distagon T✻ 15mm ƒ/2.8 (Made in Germany)
* Distagon T✻ 18mm ƒ/4
* Distagon T✻ 21mm ƒ/2.8
* C Biogon T✻ 21mm ƒ/4.5
* Biogon T✻ 25mm ƒ/2.8
* Biogon T✻ 28mm ƒ/2.8

* Distagon T✻ 35mm ƒ/1.4

* Sonnar T✻ 85mm ƒ/2 (Made in Germany)
Zeiss claims that the 25mm ƒ/2.8 ZM achieves a resolution of 400 lp/mm in the center of the image at ƒ/4, which is equal to the calculated diffraction limit for this aperture.

=== Z-series SLR lenses ===
Zeiss produces optically identical manual-focus lenses for multiple SLR lens mounts under the ZE, ZF, ZK, and ZS lines, manufactured in Japan by Cosina to Zeiss specifications.

ZE lenses fit the Canon EF lens mount. They feature electronic contacts allowing for focus-confirmation, and electric aperture operation as with standard Canon EF lenses.

ZF series lenses fit the Nikon F-mount. Four design variations are designated ZF, ZF.2, ZF-I, and ZF-IR. All are manual-focus designs with Nikon AI-S type aperture indexing.
* ZF lenses have AI-S aperture indexing, half-stop aperture ring detents, and no electronic features.
* ZF.2 lenses are like ZF lenses, with the addition CPU functionality, similar to Nikon AI-P lenses. They allow electronic focus confirmation, full metering compatibility, and electronic aperture control with Nikon SLR cameras which require CPU lenses.
* ZF-I lenses feature mechanical locks for focus and aperture, and additional environmental sealing, for industrial applications.
* ZF-IR lenses are adapted to infrared imaging, with coatings that transmit wavelengths up to 1100 nm, and focus scales marked for infrared.

ZK lenses fit the Pentax K-mount. They have no electronics, are manual focus only, KA couplers. Zeiss announced the discontinuation of the ZK line in September 2010.

ZS lenses fit the M42 lens mount (Pentacon/Practica/Pentax screw mount). By use of mount adapters they can be adapted to most 35 mm bayonet camera mounts including Canon FD and EF, Pentax K, Minolta SR and Sony/Konica Minolta/Minolta A mounts (with the exception of Nikon F mount), usually losing open-aperture-metering, multi-segment metering, focus confirmation, automatic flash zoom capabilities as well as some built-in shake reduction performance and Exif data accuracy.

=== Otus lenses ===
Zeiss produces manual focus Otus lenses for the Nikon F-mount and Canon EF mount, with electronic features equivalent to Zeiss ZF.2 and ZE lenses respectively. Otus lenses are complex no-compromise designs which Zeiss refers to as the &quot;best in the world&quot; in the normal lens and short telephoto categories. They cover the 35 mm format.
* Otus APO-Distagon T✻ 28mm ƒ/1.4
* Otus APO-Distagon T✻ 55mm ƒ/1.4
* Otus APO-Planar T✻ 85mm ƒ/1.4
* Otus APO-Sonnar T✻ 100mm ƒ/1.4

=== NASA ===
Zeiss designed the optical components for the James Webb Space Telescope.

A unique triplet of ultra-fast 50 mm lenses originally created by Zeiss for NASA&#x27;s lunar program had the distinction of being reused by Stanley Kubrick in the filming of his historical drama &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;. The period atmosphere of the film demanded that several indoor scenes be filmed by candlelight. To facilitate this, Kubrick had the lenses modified to mount onto a cinema camera and two of them subsequently further modified in separate ways to give wider angles of view.
=== Smartphone lenses ===
Zeiss worked with Nokia, and later with Microsoft Mobile as they continued production of the Lumia series. The Nokia 808 PureView features a lens custom-developed by Zeiss for its 1/1.2 inch sensor; as did its successor, the Nokia Lumia 1020. The Nokia N90 and Nokia N8 also used Zeiss optics. In 2017, Zeiss again provided optics for Nokia products through a collaboration with HMD Global, beginning with the Nokia 8.

=== ZA lenses ===
ZA (&quot;Zeiss Alpha&quot;) lenses are designed and manufactured by Sony in Japan, and co-branded with the Zeiss name. Sony and Zeiss collaboratively set design and quality parameters for ZA lenses.
* A-mount ZA-lenses fit the Sony Alpha/Konica Minolta/Minolta A-mount system. They are fully dedicated autofocus lenses with eight electrical contacts, ROM-IC, and distance encoder (&quot;(D)-function&quot; to support ADI flash). All except for the DT lens are full-frame lenses.

=== Vision care ===
Carl Zeiss Vision Care division develops, manufactures and distributes ophthalmic lenses, optical coatings, and dispensary technologies and services. Zeiss is known for ophthalmic lenses made from high refractive index glass, allowing stronger prescription lenses to be thinner.

Their progressive lens ZEISS Progressive Individual has won multiple awards including the OLA awards in 2009 presented at Washington, D.C., and the VisionPlus or VP Awards in 2014 at Mumbai, India.

=== Virtual reality ===
Sold through VR Optician (previously vr-lens.eu) as &#x27;Virtual Reality Headset Prescription Lens Adapters&#x27;, Carl Zeiss Vision is the lens provider for VR Optician&#x27;s aftermarket prescription lens adaptors. These lens adaptors are sold for a wide variety of Virtual Reality headsets, like the Apple Vision Pro, allowing those with visual impairments to use them without wearing glasses or contact lenses.

=== Industrial metrology ===
Zeiss Industrial Metrology specializes in high-accuracy measurement systems, including coordinate-measuring machines (CMMs), computed tomography measurement machines (non-medical), optical measuring equipment, metrology software and measurement sensor systems. The Industrial Metrology subsidiary provides this equipment to a wide range of manufacturing facilities worldwide.

Zeiss has manufactured coordinate measuring machines since 1919, offering very basic manually operated CMMs. In 1973, Zeiss introduced the UMM 500, using a Zeiss sensor system and Hewlett-Packard computer. Zeiss has since vastly improved and diversified their product line and now feature many high accuracy CMMs, the Metrotom, a CT x-ray scanning measuring machine, with the ability to quickly and completely measure a part in 3 dimensions without ever touching the part, and the O-INSPECT, a combination optical-tactile measurement machine.

Zeiss is currently a member of the International Association of CMM Manufacturers (IACMM).

Many of the sensor systems produced by Zeiss are proprietary technologies, using technologies exclusively patented by Zeiss, and therefore can offer better accuracy and repeatability than its competitors.

Zeiss was the first manufacturer of coordinate measurement machines to introduce computer numerical control (CNC) technology to a coordinate measurement machine and was the first company to offer CNC stylus changer capability for these machines.

=== Semiconductor manufacturing technology ===
Carl Zeiss SMT systems for DUV and EUV electromagnetic radiation are used in chip-lithography machines for focusing the extremely short wavelengths. Together with the company ASML and its subsidiaries and partners Zeiss is the sole supplier of the lithography systems that are able to manufacture core layers of the latest semiconductor chips.

=== Microscopes ===
Zeiss offers different types of microscopes:
* Optical microscopes (LMs)
* Laser scanning microscopes (LSMs)
* Scanning electron microscopes (SEMs)
* Scanning helium ion microscopes (SHIMs)
* X-ray Microscopes (XRMs)

=== Fire doors ===
The name Zeiss Ikon can also be found in old cinemas, on fire shutters on the projection windows. These had heat fuses that melted and dropped the shutter over the hole if the film caught fire in the projection booth.

<text>A very-small-aperture terminal (VSAT) is a two-way satellite ground station with a dish antenna that is smaller than 3.8 meters. The majority of VSAT antennas range from 75 cm to 1.2 m. Bit rates, in most cases, range from 4 kbit/s to 16 Mbit/s. VSATs access satellites in geosynchronous orbit or geostationary orbit to relay data from small remote Earth stations (terminals) to other terminals (in mesh topology) or master Earth station &quot;hubs&quot; (in star topology).

VSATs are used to transmit narrowband data (e.g., point-of-sale transactions using credit cards, polling or RFID data, or SCADA), or broadband data (for the provision of satellite Internet access to remote locations, VoIP or video). VSATs are also used for transportable, on-the-move (utilising phased array antennas) or mobile maritime communications.

==History==
The concept of the geostationary orbit was originated by Russian theorist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, who wrote articles on space travel around the beginning of the 20th century. In the 1920s, Hermann Oberth and Herman Potocnik, also known as Herman Noordung, described an orbit at an altitude of whose period exactly matched the Earth&#x27;s rotational period, making it appear to hover over a fixed point on the Earth&#x27;s equator.

Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s October 1945 &quot;Wireless World&quot; article (called &quot;Extra-Terrestrial Relays: Can Rocket Stations Give World-wide Radio Coverage?&quot;) discussed the necessary orbital characteristics for a geostationary orbit and the frequencies and power needed for communication.

Live satellite communication was developed in the 1960s by NASA, which launched Syncom 1–3 satellites. Syncom 3 transmitted live coverage of the 1964 Olympics in Japan to viewers in the United States and Europe. On April 6, 1965, the first commercial satellite was launched into space, Intelsat I, nicknamed Early Bird.

The first commercial VSATs were C band (6 GHz) receive-only systems by Equatorial Communications using spread spectrum technology. More than 30,000 60 cm antenna systems were sold in the early 1980s. Equatorial later developed a C band (4/6 GHz) two-way system using 1 m x 0.5 m antennas and sold about 10,000 units in 1984–85.

In the early 1980s, LINKABIT (the predecessor to Qualcomm and ViaSat) developed the world&#x27;s first Ku-band (12–14 GHz) VSAT for Schlumberger to provide network connectivity for oil field drilling and exploration units. LINKABIT which had become part of M/A-COM went on to develop VSATs for enterprise customers such as Walmart, Holiday Inn, Chrysler, and General Motors. These enterprise terminals made up the vast majority of sites for the next 20 years for two-way data or telephony applications. A large VSAT network, with more than 12,000 sites, was deployed by Spacenet and MCI for the U.S. Postal Service in the 1980s. , the largest VSAT Ku-band network containing over 100,000 VSATs was deployed by and is operated by Hughes Communications for lottery applications.

In 2005, WildBlue (now ViaSat) started deploying VSAT networks deploying Ka-band. ViaSat launched the highest capacity satellite ever, ViaSat-1, in 2011 to expand the WildBlue base under its Exede brand. In 2007, Hughes Communications started deploying VSAT sites for consumers under its HughesNet brand on the Spaceway 3 satellite and later in 2012 on its EchoStar XVII/Jupiter 1 satellite. By September 2014, Hughes became the first Satellite Internet Provider to surpass one million active terminals.

==Configurations==

Most VSAT networks are configured in one of these topologies:
* A star topology, using a central uplink site, such as a network operations center (NOC), to transport data back and forth to each VSAT via satellite,
* A mesh topology, where each VSAT relays data via satellite to another terminal by acting as a hub, minimizing the need for a centralized uplink site,
* A combination of both star and mesh topologies. Some VSAT networks are configured by having several centralized uplink sites (and VSAT stemming from it) connected in a multi-star topology with each star (and each terminal in each star) connected to each other in a mesh topology. Others configured in only a single-star topology sometimes will have each terminal connected to each other as well, resulting in each terminal acting as a central hub. These configurations are utilized to minimize the overall cost of the network, and to alleviate the amount of data that has to be relayed through a central uplink site (or sites) of a star or multi-star network.

==Future applications==

Advances in technology have dramatically improved the price–performance ratio of fixed satellite service (FSS) over the past five years. New VSAT systems are coming online using technology that promise higher data rates for lower costs.

FSS systems currently in orbit have a huge capacity with a relatively low price structure. FSS systems provide various applications for subscribers, including: telephony, fax, television, high-speed data communication services, Internet access, satellite news gathering (SNG), Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) and others. These systems provide high-quality service because they create efficient communication systems for both residential and business users.

==Constituent parts of a VSAT configuration==
* Antenna
* Block upconverter (BUC)
* Low-noise block downconverter (LNB)
* Orthomode transducer (OMT)
* Interfacility link cable (IFL)
* Indoor unit (IDU)

All the outdoor parts on the dish are collectively called the ODU (Outdoor Unit), i.e., OMT to split signal between BUC and LNB. The IDU is effectively a modem, usually with Ethernet port and 2 x F-connectors for the coax to BUC (Transmit) and from LNB (Receive). The Astra2Connect has an all-in-one OMT/BUC/LNA that looks like a Quad LNB in shape and size which mounts on a regular TV satellite mount. As a consequence it is only 500 mW compared with the normal 2W, thus is poorer in rain. Skylogic&#x27;s Tooway system also uses an integrated OMT/BUC/LNB assembly called a transmit and receive integrated assembly (TRIA), which is 3W. For large antennas there are also mechanical struts that prevent them to move due to strong winds, losing the pointing and causing service interruption

== Maritime VSAT ==

A maritime VSAT has features that allow it to be operated on a ship at sea. A ship that is underway is in continuous motion in all axes. The antenna part of a marine VSAT system must be stabilized with respect to the horizon and true north as the ship moves beneath it. Motors and sensors are used to keep the antenna pointed accurately at the satellite. This enables it to transmit to and receive from the satellite while minimising losses and interference with adjacent satellites. New technology is emerging that will allow a solid state device (flat panel) to steer an antenna electronically without moving parts.

=== Technology ===

Initially, stabilized satellite antennas were used on ships for reception of television signals. One of the first companies to manufacture stabilized VSAT antennas was SeaTel of Concord, California, which launched its first stabilized antenna in 1978. SeaTel dominates the supply of two-way VSAT stabilised antenna systems to the marine industry with almost 72% of the market in 2007 compared to Orbit&#x27;s 17.6%. Initially, maritime VSAT was using single channel per carrier technology, which suited large-volume users like oil drilling rigs and oil platforms and large fleets of ships from one shipowner sailing within one or few satellite footprints. This changed when the company launched its IP-based time-division multiple access technology that dynamically allocated bandwidth to each ship for shared bandwidth, lowering the entry-level cost for getting maritime VSAT installed, which turned out to be of key importance to small to mid-sized fleets, and thus to the market acceptance of VSAT.

===Market===
According to the Maritime VSAT report issued by the Comsys Group, the market for stabilised maritime VSAT services (not including oil and gas rigs) reached more than $400 million in 2007. In 2010, COMSYS released its &quot;2nd Maritime VSAT Report&quot;, where the market estimate had increased to $590 million in 2009 with predictions for 2010 at $850 million. The estimated size of the market in terms of vessels eligible to get VSAT was in this report set to in excess of 42,000 with just over 34,000 to go. The major companies market share in terms of number of vessels in service were in 2009 (2007 in parentheses) according to these reports: Vizada: 17.6% (26.0%), Ship Equip: 11.0% (10.7%), Cap Rock 2.8% (2.9%), MTN 7.5% (6.4%), Stratos - % (3.6%), KVH 5.4% (- %) Elektrikom 4.9% (3.2%), Intelsat 3.4% (- %), Eutelsat 3.1%, NSSL 3.1%, Radio Holland 3.0%, Telemar 3.0%, DTS 2.6% and others accounted for 32.6% (27.7%). Many of the major providers have branded their maritime VSAT offerings such that Vizada offers its service through the Marlink division and the SeaLink and WaveCall products, OmniAccess, through their BroadBEAM products and Ship Equip calls its offering Sevsat.

<doc id="202073" wikidata="Q1770211" url="?curid=202073" title="Lilith Fair">
<text>Lilith Fair was a concert tour and travelling music festival, founded by Canadian musician Sarah McLachlan, Nettwerk Music Group&#x27;s Dan Fraser and Terry McBride, and New York talent agent Marty Diamond. It took place during the summers of 1997 to 1999, and was revived in the summer of 2010. It consisted solely of female solo artists and female-led bands. In its initial three years, Lilith Fair raised over $10 million for charity.

==History==
In 1996, Canadian musical artist Sarah McLachlan became frustrated with concert promoters and radio stations that refused to feature two female musicians in a row. Bucking conventional industry &quot;wisdom&quot;, she booked a successful tour for herself and Paula Cole. At least one of their appearances together—in Vancouver, British Columbia on September 14, 1996—went by the name &quot;Lilith Fair&quot; and included performances by McLachlan, Cole, Lisa Loeb, and Michelle McAdorey, formerly of Crash Vegas.

The next year, McLachlan founded the Lilith Fair tour, taking &quot;Lilith&quot; from the Jewish lore that Lilith was Adam&#x27;s first wife who refused to be subservient to him.

In 1997, Lilith Fair garnered a $16 million gross, making it the top-grossing of any touring festival. Among all concert tours for that year, it was the 16th-highest grossing. McLachlan followed this success with two more rounds, in 1998 and 1999.

In 2010, Lilith Fair staged a revival with mixed results, as several dates were cancelled and many performers backed out of scheduled performances.

In March 2011, McLachlan declared that the Lilith concept was no longer being considered for future shows, due to changing audience views and expectations.

Three volumes of &quot;Lilith Fair: A Celebration of Women in Music&quot; documented the performances.

==Performers==

===1997===
The artists appearing at Lilith Fair varied by date (with McLachlan and Suzanne Vega the only artists to play all dates). Appearances were organized into three stages. Almost all Village Stage artists performed only one or two dates. Many of them won slots on the bill in a series of local talent searches in their home cities.

==2010 revival==

In an April 25, 2009, Twitter post, Nettwerk founder Terry McBride announced that a Lilith Fair tour through North America would be relaunched for the summer of 2010, with a two-week tour of Europe to follow.

The tour was plagued with financial problems from the beginning. The first seven shows were sparsely attended and the eighth show was the first to be cancelled. Initially, Sarah McLachlan claimed (in an interview posted on the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot; website on July 9) that the July 8 Phoenix show was cancelled in protest of Arizona Senate Bill 1070, which she strongly opposes.

The tour fell apart on the road as headliners Carly Simon, Norah Jones, Kelly Clarkson, the Go-Go&#x27;s, and Queen Latifah dropped out, fearing that they would not be paid for their performances.

Due to poor ticket sales, thirteen shows (about one-third of the tour) were scratched (two announced on June 25, ten more on July 1, one additional on July 2) and one reassigned to a smaller venue.

The artists appearing at Lilith Fair vary by date (with McLachlan the only artist to play all dates). Appearances are organized into three stages. Below is a list of artists who performed at Lilith Fair in the 2010 revival.

<doc id="202077" wikidata="Q7892570" url="?curid=202077" title="United States military casualties of war">
<text>The following is a tabulation of United States military casualties of war.

==Overview==
Note: &quot;Total casualties&quot; includes wounded, combat and non-combat deaths but not missing in action. &quot;Deaths – other&quot; includes all non-combat deaths including those from bombing, massacres, disease, suicide, and murder.

==Wars ranked by U.S. battle deaths==
The following is a list of wars caught by number of U.S. battle deaths suffered by military forces; deaths from disease and other non-battle causes are not included. Although the Confederate States of America did not consider itself part of the United States, and its forces were not part of the U.S. Army, its battle deaths are included with the losses of the Union (American Civil War).

==Wars ranked by total number of U.S. military deaths==

&quot;Deaths per day&quot; is the total number of Americans killed in military service, divided by the number of days between the commencement and end of hostilities. &quot;Deaths per population&quot; is the total number of deaths in military service, divided by the U.S. population of the year indicated.

==Notes==
a. Revolutionary War: All figures from the Revolutionary War are rounded estimates. Commonly cited casualty figures provided by the Department of Defense are 4,435 killed and 6,188 wounded, although the original government report that generated these numbers warned that the totals were incomplete and far too low. In 1974, historian Howard Peckham and a team of researchers came up with a total of 6,824 killed in action and 8,445 wounded. Because of incomplete records, Peckham estimated that this new total number of killed in action was still about 1,000 too low. Military historian John Shy subsequently estimated the total killed in action at 8,000, and argued that the number of wounded was probably far higher, about 25,000. The &quot;other&quot; deaths are primarily from disease, including prisoners who died on British prison ships.

b. Other actions against pirates: Includes actions fought in the West Indies, the Greek isles, off of Louisiana, China and Vietnam. Other deaths resulted from disease and accidents.

c. Civil War: All Union casualty figures, and Confederate killed in action, from &quot;The Oxford Companion to American Military History&quot; except where noted (NPS figures). estimate of total Confederate dead from James M. McPherson, &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; (Oxford University Press, 1988), 854. Newer estimates place the total death toll at 650,000 to 850,000. 148 of the Union dead were U.S. Marines.
ca. Civil War April 2, 2012, Doctor David Hacker after extensive research offered new casualty rates higher by 20%; his work has been accepted by the academic community and is represented here.

d. World War I figures include expeditions in North Russia and Siberia. See also World War I casualties

da. World War II Note: as of March 31, 1946, there were an estimated 286,959 dead of whom 246,492 were identified; of 40,467 who were unidentified 18,641 were located {10,986 reposed in military cemeteries and 7,655 in isolated graves} and 21,826 were reported not located. As of April 6, 1946, there were 539 American Military Cemeteries which contained 241,500 dead. Note the American Battle Monuments Commission database for the World War II reports that in 18 ABMC Cemeteries total of 93,238 buried and 78,979 missing and that &quot;The World War II database on this web site contains the names of those buried at our cemeteries, or listed as Missing in Action, buried or lost at sea. It does not contain the names of the 233,174 Americans returned to the United States for burial...&quot; Similarly, the ABMC Records do not cover inter-war deaths such as the Port Chicago disaster in which 320 died. As of June 2018 total of US World War II casualties listed as MIA is 72,823

e. Korean War: Note: gives Dead as 33,746 and Wounded as 103, 284 and MIA as 8,177. The American Battle Monuments Commission database for the Korean War reports that &quot;The Department of Defense reports that 54,246 American service men and women lost their lives during the Korean War. This includes all losses worldwide. Since the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., honors all U.S. Military who lost their lives during the War, we have tried to obtain the names of those who died in other areas besides Korea during the period June 27, 1950, to July 27, 1954, one year after the Korean Armistice...&quot;. {For a breakdown of Worldwide casualties of 54,246 see The Korean War educator at gives figures as In-theatre/non theater}
After their retreat in 1950, dead Marines and soldiers were buried at a temporary gravesite near Hungnam, North Korea. During &quot;Operation Glory&quot; which occurred from July to November 1954 the dead of each side were exchanged; remains of 4,167 US soldiers/Marines were exchanged for 13,528 North Korean/Chinese dead.

<doc id="202085" wikidata="Q710005" url="?curid=202085" title="Clifford Etienne">
<text>Clifford Etienne (born March 9, 1970) is an American former professional boxer and convicted robber, who is currently serving a 105-year prison sentence without the possibility of parole. Known for his aggressive, high-volume style despite being a heavyweight, he fought Mike Tyson, Francois Botha, Nikolay Valuev, Calvin Brock, and Lamon Brewster.

==Background==
Born and raised in Louisiana, Etienne was a self-proclaimed &quot;nerd&quot; growing up. He attended St. Martinville High School where he was a standout linebacker, recruited by top colleges such as LSU, Nebraska, Texas A&amp;M, and Oklahoma. This potential college football career was derailed by a 40-year prison sentence for armed robbery, which was committed at a shopping mall during his senior year. While incarcerated, Etienne, who then weighed 290 pounds, took up boxing and won the state prison boxing championship. While in prison he was a member of the &quot;Gunslingers&quot; prison boxing team in Louisiana and reportedly had a 30–0 prison record. He was released on good behavior after serving 10 years. While incarcerated, Etienne enrolled in classes at Southern University, and received high marks for his degree.

==Professional career==
Upon being paroled from prison in 1998, after serving 10 years for attempted armed robbery, he became a professional boxer; he won 29 matches (20 knockouts), lost 4, and drew 2.

==Rise to the top==

Etienne was named 2000&#x27;s &quot;Most Exciting Fighter to Watch&quot; in the heavyweight division by &quot;The Ring Magazine&quot;, largely the result of his unanimous decision over then-undefeated Lawrence Clay Bey. The fight was widely considered to be one of the best heavyweight matches of that year. He also defeated Lamon Brewster, the future WBO heavyweight champion, via a fairly-dominant unanimous decision after ten rounds in May 2000.

Etienne landed a contract with Showtime and his stock began to rise, but it quickly fell after an upset loss to Fres Oquendo, who stopped Etienne in the eighth round of their fight in March 2001.

After rebuilding some of his lost stature with wins, he was catapulted to the world&#x27;s stage in a 2003 bout against &quot;Iron&quot; Mike Tyson, where Etienne suffered a first-round knock-out only 49 seconds after being caught with a short right hand from Tyson.

==Decline==
After the loss to Tyson, Etienne&#x27;s future seemed to be that of a journeyman opponent. Calvin Brock stopped Etienne in the third round in January 2005.

Etienne&#x27;s last fight was against Nicolay Valuev. &quot;The Beast from the East&quot;, who would go on to become the WBA champion, stopped Etienne in the third round of their fight in Bayreuth, Germany in May 2005.

==Criminal activity and imprisonment==

On August 11, 2005, Fightnews.com reported Etienne&#x27;s ring career was definitely over with the following story:

:Well known heavyweight Clifford Etienne was arrested Wednesday in Baton Rouge, Louisiana on charges of armed robbery, kidnapping, and the attempted murder of a police officer. Etienne allegedly robbed a local business, car-jacked a vehicle containing a woman and her children, then pulled a gun on police officers. He is being held in East Baton Rouge Parish Prison with a $70,000 bond.

On June 22, 2006, following his trial in Baton Rouge, Etienne was found guilty and sentenced to 160 years in prison without parole for an allegedly cocaine-fueled crime spree that included robbing a check cashing business, carjacking, and attempting to shoot a police officer. In April 2013, his sentence was reduced from 160 years to 105 years due to a “technicality”. Etienne is now a painter, painting artwork from prison. He also works as a barber at the same prison.

<text>A member of the Senedd (MS; plural: &quot;MSs&quot;; ; , plural: ) is a representative elected to the Senedd (Welsh Parliament; ). There are sixty members, with forty members chosen to represent individual Senedd constituencies, and twenty to represent the five electoral regions of the Senedd in Wales.

Each person in Wales is represented by five MSs: one for their local constituency (encompassing their local area where they reside), and another four covering their electoral region (a large grouping of constituencies). Wales&#x27;s five electoral regions are Mid and West Wales, North Wales, South Wales Central, South Wales East and South Wales West.

A holder of this office was formerly known as an assembly member (AM; plural: AMs; ; , plural: ), under the legislature&#x27;s former name, the National Assembly for Wales, from its inception in 1999 until 2020 when it adopted its current names, Welsh Parliament, and , simply referred to as Senedd in both English and Welsh.

Since 2011, members are elected for a five-year term of office under an additional member system, in which 40 MSs represent smaller geographical divisions known as &quot;constituencies&quot; and are elected by first-past-the-post voting, and 20 MSs represent five &quot;electoral regions&quot; using the D&#x27;Hondt method of proportional representation. Typically, the largest party holding the largest number of MSs in the Senedd forms the Welsh Government, and in the event of not securing a majority of MSs, the largest party has first rights to begin coalition talks with other smaller parties. Prior to 2011, they held four-year terms, with some MSs calling for a return of four-year terms from the current five. From the next Senedd election, due in 2026, the size of the Senedd will increase to 96.

==Methods of election==
MSs are elected in one of two ways:
#First-past-the-post constituency or
#Regional additional-member

Forty are elected as constituency MSs and twenty are elected as additional members, four from each of five regional groups of constituencies. This additional member system produces a form of proportional representation for each region.

==Elections==
All MSs positions become simultaneously vacant for elections held on a five-year cycle. If a vacancy arises at another time, due to death or resignation, it may be filled in one of two ways, depending on whether the vacancy is for a first-past-the-post constituency MS or for an additional-member MS.

A constituency vacancy may be filled by a by-election. An additional member vacancy may be filled by the next available candidate on the relevant party list.

<doc id="202089" wikidata="Q2389676" url="?curid=202089" title="Casualties of the Iraq War">
<text>Estimates of the casualties from the Iraq War (beginning with the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the ensuing occupation and insurgency and civil war) have come in several forms, and those estimates of different types of Iraq War casualties vary greatly.

Estimating war-related deaths poses many challenges. Experts distinguish between population-based studies, which extrapolate from random samples of the population, and body counts, which tally reported deaths and likely significantly underestimate casualties. Population-based studies produce estimates of the number of Iraq War casualties ranging from 151,000 violent deaths as of June 2006 (per the Iraq Family Health Survey) to 1,033,000 excess deaths (per the 2007 Opinion Research Business (ORB) survey). Other survey-based studies covering different time-spans find 461,000 total deaths (over 60% of them violent) as of June 2011 (per &quot;PLOS Medicine&quot; 2013), and 655,000 total deaths (over 90% of them violent) as of June 2006 (per the 2006 Lancet study). Body counts counted at least 110,600 violent deaths as of April 2009 (Associated Press). The Iraq Body Count project documents 186,901 – 210,296 violent civilian deaths in their table. All estimates of Iraq War casualties are disputed.

== Additional statistics for the Iraq War ==



* Iraqis:
* Deadliest single insurgent bombings:
** August 14, 2007. Truck bombs – 2007 Yazidi communities bombings (in northwestern Iraq):
*** 796 killed.
* Other deadly days:
** November 23, 2006, (281 killed) and April 18, 2007, (233 killed):
*** &quot;4 bombings in Baghdad kill at least 183. ... Nationwide, the number of people killed or found dead on Wednesday &quot;[, April 18, 2007, ]&quot; was 233, which was the second deadliest day in Iraq since Associated Press began keeping records in May 2005. Five car bombings, mortar rounds and other attacks killed 281 people across Iraq on November 23, 2006, according to the AP count.&quot;


* As of January 12, 2007, 500 U.S. troops have undergone amputations due to the Iraq War. Toes and fingers are not counted.
* As of September 30, 2006, 725 American troops have had limbs amputated from wounds received in Iraq and Afghanistan.
* A 2006 study by the Walter Reed Medical Center, which serves more critically injured soldiers than most VA hospitals, concluded that 62 percent of patients there had suffered a brain injury.
* In March 2003, U.S. military personnel were wounded in action at a rate averaging about 350 per month. As of September 2007, this rate has increased to about 675 per month.



* U.S. military: number unknown.
** An October 18, 2005, &quot;USA Today&quot; article reports:
*** &quot;More than one in four U.S. troops have come home from the Iraq war with health problems that require medical or mental health treatment, according to The Pentagon&#x27;s first detailed screening of service members leaving a war zone.&quot;
* Iraqi combatants: number unknown


* As of November 4, 2006, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimated that 1.8 million Iraqis had been displaced to neighboring countries, and 1.6 million were displaced internally, with nearly 100,000 Iraqis fleeing to Syria and Jordan each month.

== Iraqi invasion casualties ==
Franks reportedly estimated soon after the invasion that there had been 30,000 Iraqi casualties as of April 9, 2003. That number comes from the transcript of an October 2003 interview of U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld with journalist Bob Woodward. But neither could remember the number clearly, nor whether it was just for deaths, or both deaths and wounded.

A May 28, 2003, &quot;Guardian&quot; article reported that &quot;Extrapolating from the death-rates of between 3% and 10% found in the units around Baghdad, one reaches a toll of between 13,500 and 45,000 dead among troops and paramilitaries.&quot;

An October 20, 2003, study by the Project on Defense Alternatives at Commonwealth Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, estimated that for March 19, 2003, to April 30, 2003, the &quot;probable death of approximately 11,000 to 15,000 Iraqis, including approximately 3,200 to 4,300 civilian noncombatants.&quot;

The Iraq Body Count project (IBC) documented a higher number of civilian deaths up to the end of the major combat phase (May 1, 2003). In a 2005 report, using updated information, the IBC reported that 7,299 civilians are documented to have been killed, primarily by U.S. air and ground forces. There were 17,338 civilian injuries inflicted up to May 1, 2003. The IBC says its figures are probably underestimates because: &quot;many deaths will probably go unreported or unrecorded by officials and media.&quot;

== Iraqi civilian casualties ==

=== Iraq Body Count project (IBC) ===
An independent British-American group, the Iraq Body Count project (IBC project) compiles reported Iraqi civilian deaths resulting from war since the 2003 invasion and ensuing insurgency and civil war, including those caused directly by coalition military action, Iraqi military actions, the Iraqi insurgency, and those resulting from excess crime. The IBC maintains that the occupying authority has a responsibility to prevent these deaths under international law.

The Iraq Body Count (IBC) project has recorded a range of at least 185,194 – 208,167 total violent civilian deaths through June 2020 in their database. The IBC project records its numbers based on a &quot;comprehensive survey of commercial media and NGO-based reports, along with official records that have been released into the public sphere. Reports range from specific, incident based accounts to figures from hospitals, morgues, and other documentary data-gathering agencies.&quot; The IBC was also given access to the WikiLeaks disclosures of the Iraq War Logs.

Iraq Body Count project data shows that the type of attack that resulted in the most civilian deaths was execution after abduction or capture. These accounted for 33% of civilian deaths and 29% of these deaths involved torture. The following most common causes of death were small arms gunfire at 20%, suicide bombs at 14%, vehicle bombs at 9%, roadside bombs at 5%, and air attacks at 5%.

The IBC project, reported that by the end of the major combat phase of the invasion period up to April 30, 2003, 7,419 civilians had been killed, primarily by U.S. air-and-ground forces.

The IBC project released a report detailing the deaths it recorded between March 2003 and March 2005 in which it recorded 24,865 civilian deaths. The report says the U.S. and its allies were responsible for the largest share (37%) with 9,270 deaths. The remaining deaths were attributed to anti-occupation forces (9%), crime (36%) and unknown agents (11%). It also lists the primary sources used by the media – mortuaries, medics, Iraqi officials, eyewitnesses, police, relatives, U.S.-coalition, journalists, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), friends/associates and other.

According to a 2010 assessment by John Sloboda, director of Iraq Body Count, 150,000 people including 122,000 civilians were killed in the Iraq War with U.S. and Coalition forces responsible for at least 22,668 insurgents as well as 13,807 civilians, with the rest of the civilians killed by insurgents, militias, or terrorists. 

The IBC project has been criticized by some, including scholars, who believe it counts only a small percentage of the number of actual deaths because of its reliance on media sources. The IBC project&#x27;s director, John Sloboda, has stated, &quot;We&#x27;ve always said our work is an undercount, you can&#x27;t possibly expect that a media-based analysis will get all the deaths.&quot; However, the IBC project rejects many of these criticisms as exaggerated or misinformed.

According to a 2013 Lancet article, the Iraq Body Count is &quot;a non-peer-reviewed but innovative online and media-centred approach that passively counted non-combatant civilian deaths as they were recorded in the media and available morgue reports. In passive surveillance no special effort is made to find those deaths that go unreported. The volunteer staff collecting data for the IBC have risked criticism that their data are inherently biased because of scarcity or absence of independent verification, variation in original sources of information, and underestimation of mortality from violence... In research circles, random cross-sectional cluster sampling survey methods are deemed to be a more rigorous epidemiological method in conflict settings.&quot;

==== Civilian deaths by perpetrator ====
In 2011, the IBC published data in PLOS Medicine on 2003-2008 civilian deaths in Iraq by perpetrator and cause of death. The study broke down civilian deaths by perpetrator into the following categories:

* 74% unidentified perpetrator: defined as &quot;those who target civilians (i.e., no identifiable military target is present), while appearing indistinguishable from civilians: for example, a suicide bomber disguised as a civilian in a market. Unknown (i.e., unidentified) perpetrators in Iraq include sectarian combatants and Anti-Coalition combatants who maintain a civilian appearance while targeting civilians.&quot;

* 11% anti-coalition forces: defined as &quot;un-uniformed combatants identified by attacks on coalition targets&quot; during the event. Anti-Coalition combatants in the event of targeting purely civilians would instead be classed under the &quot;unidentified perpetrator&quot; category.

* 12% coalition forces: identified by uniforms or use of air attacks.

=== IBC table of violent civilian deaths ===

Following are the yearly IBC Project violent civilian death totals, broken down by month from the beginning of 2003. Table below is copied irregularly from the source page, and is soon out-of-date as data is continually updated at the source. As of June 12, 2023 the top of the IBC database page with the table says 186,901 – 210,296 &quot;Documented civilian deaths from violence&quot;. That page also says: &quot;Gaps in recording and reporting suggest that even our highest totals to date may be missing many civilian deaths from violence.&quot;


=== People&#x27;s Kifah ===

The Iraqi political party People&#x27;s Kifah, or Struggle Against Hegemony (PK) said that its survey conducted between March and June 2003 throughout the non-Kurdish areas of Iraq tallied 36,533 civilians killed in those areas by June 2003. While detailed town-by-town totals were given by the PK spokesperson, details of methodology are very thin and raw data is not in the public domain. A still-less-detailed report on this study appeared some months later on Al Jazeera&#x27;s website, and covered casualties up to October 2003.

== Iraqi refugees crisis ==
Roughly 40 percent of Iraq&#x27;s middle class is believed to have fled, the U.N. reported in 2007. Most are fleeing systematic persecution and have no desire to return. All kinds of people, from university professors to bakers, have been targeted by militias, Iraqi insurgents and criminals. An estimated 331 school teachers were slain in the first four months of 2006, according to Human Rights Watch, and at least 2,000 Iraqi doctors have been killed and 250 kidnapped since the 2003 U.S. invasion.

== Coalition military casualties ==

For the latest casualty numbers see the overview chart at the top of the page.

Since the official handover of power to the Iraqi Interim Government on June 28, 2004, coalition soldiers have continued to come under attack in towns across Iraq.

National Public Radio, iCasualties.org, and GlobalSecurity.org have month-by-month charts of American troop deaths in the Iraq War.
The combined total of coalition and contractor casualties in the conflict is now over ten times that of the 1990–1991 Gulf War. In the Gulf War, coalition forces suffered around 378 deaths, and among the Iraqi military, tens of thousands were killed, along with thousands of civilians.

=== Troops fallen ill, injured, or wounded ===
See the overview chart at the top of the page for recent numbers.

On August 29, 2006, &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; reported: &quot;Because of new body armor and advances in military medicine, for example, the ratio of combat-zone deaths to those wounded has dropped from 24 percent in Vietnam to 13 percent in Iraq and Afghanistan. In other words, the numbers of those killed as a percentage of overall casualties is lower.&quot;
Many U.S. veterans of the Iraq War have reported a range of serious health issues, including tumors, daily blood in urine and stool, sexual dysfunction, migraines, frequent muscle spasms, and other symptoms similar to the debilitating symptoms of &quot;Gulf War syndrome&quot; reported by many veterans of the 1991 Gulf War, which some believe is related to the U.S.&#x27;s use of radioactive depleted uranium.

A study of U.S. veterans published in July 2004 in &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental disorders in Iraq and Afghanistan veterans found that 5 percent to 9.4 percent (depending on the strictness of the PTSD definition used) suffered from PTSD before deployment. After deployment, 6.2 percent to 19.9 percent suffered from PTSD. For the broad definition of PTSD that represents an increase of 10.5 percent (19.9 percent – 9.4 percent = 10.5 percent). That is 10,500 additional cases of PTSD for every 100,000 U.S. troops after they have served in Iraq. ePluribus Media, an independent citizen journalism collective, is tracking and cataloging press-reported possible, probable, or confirmed incidents of post-deployment or combat-zone cases in its PTSD Timeline.

Information on injuries suffered by troops of other coalition countries is less readily available, but a statement in Hansard indicated that 2,703 U.K. soldiers had been medically evacuated from Iraq for wounds or injuries as of October 4, 2004, and that 155 U.K. troops were wounded in combat in the initial invasion.

Leishmaniasis has been reported by U.S. troops stationed in Iraq, including visceral leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis, spread by biting sand fleas, was diagnosed in hundreds of U.S. troops compared to just 32 during the first Gulf War.

=== Accidents and negligence ===
As of August 2008, sixteen American troops have died from accidental electrocutions in Iraq according to the Defense Department. One soldier had been electrocuted in a shower, while another had been electrocuted in a swimming pool. KBR, the contractor responsible, had been warned by employees of unsafe practices, and was criticised following the revelations.

=== &quot;Nightline&quot; controversy ===
Ted Koppel, host of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot;, devoted his entire show on April 30, 2004, to reading the names of 721 of the 737 U.S. troops who had died thus far in Iraq. (The show had not been able to confirm the remaining sixteen names.) Claiming that the broadcast was &quot;motivated by a political agenda designed to undermine the efforts of the United States in Iraq&quot;, the Sinclair Broadcast Group took the action of barring the seven ABC network-affiliated stations it controls from airing the show. The decision to censor the broadcast drew criticism from both sides, including members of the armed forces, opponents of the war, MoveOn.org, and most notably Republican U.S. Senator John McCain, who denounced the move as &quot;unpatriotic&quot; and &quot;a gross disservice to the public&quot;.

=== Amputees ===

As of January 18, 2007, there were at least 500 American amputees due to the Iraq War. In 2016, the number was estimated to be 1,650 U.S. troops. The 2007 estimate suggests amputees represent 2.2% of the 22,700 U.S. troops wounded in action (5% for soldiers whose wounds prevented them returning to duty).

=== Traumatic brain injuries ===
By March 2009, the Pentagon estimated as many as 360,000 U.S. veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts may have suffered traumatic brain injuries (TBI), including 45,000 to 90,000 veterans with persistent symptoms requiring specialized care.

In February 2007, one expert from the VA estimated that the number of undiagnosed TBIs were higher than 7,500.

According to &quot;USA Today&quot;, by November 2007 there were more than an estimated 20,000 US troops who had signs of brain injuries without being classified as wounded during combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.

=== Mental illness and suicide ===
A top U.S. Army psychiatrist, Colonel Charles Hoge, said in March 2008 that nearly 30% of troops on their third deployment suffered from serious mental-health problems, and that one year was not enough time between combat tours.

A March 12, 2007, &quot;Time&quot; article reported on a study published in the &quot;Archives of Internal Medicine&quot;. About one third of the 103,788 veterans returning from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars seen at U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs facilities between September 30, 2001, and September 30, 2005, were diagnosed with mental illness or a psycho-social disorder, such as homelessness and marital problems, including domestic violence. More than half of those diagnosed, 56 percent, were suffering from more than one disorder. The most common combination was post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.

In January 2008, the U.S. Army reported that the rate of suicide among soldiers in 2007 was the highest since the Army started counting in 1980. There were 121 suicides in 2007, a 20-percent jump over the prior year. Also, there were around 2100 attempted suicides and self-injuries in 2007. Other sources reveal higher estimates.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine reported on June 5, 2008:

Data contained in the Army&#x27;s fifth Mental Health Advisory Team report indicate that, according to an anonymous survey of U.S. troops taken last fall, about 12% of combat troops in Iraq and 17% of those in Afghanistan are taking prescription antidepressants or sleeping pills to help them cope. ... About a third of soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq say they can&#x27;t see a mental-health professional when they need to. When the number of troops in Iraq surged by 30,000 last year, the number of Army mental-health workers remained the same – about 200 – making counseling and care even tougher to get.

In the same article &quot;Time&quot; also reported on some of the reasons for the prescription drug use:

That imbalance between seeing the price of war up close and yet not feeling able to do much about it, the survey suggests, contributes to feelings of &quot;intense fear, helplessness or horror&quot; that plant the seeds of mental distress. &quot;A friend was liquefied in the driver&#x27;s position on a tank, and I saw everything&quot;, was a typical comment. Another: &quot;A huge f______ bomb blew my friend&#x27;s head off like 50 meters from me.&quot; Such indelible scenes – and wondering when and where the next one will happen – are driving thousands of soldiers to take antidepressants, military psychiatrists say. It&#x27;s not hard to imagine why.

Concern has been expressed by mental health professionals about the effects on the emotional health and development of returning veterans&#x27; infants and children, due to the increased rates of interpersonal violence, posttraumatic stress, depression, and substance abuse that have been reported among these veterans. Moreover, the stressful effects of physical casualties and loss pose enormous stress for the primary caregiver that can adversely affect her or his parenting, as well as the couple&#x27;s children directly. The mental health needs of military families in the aftermath of combat exposure and other war-related trauma have been thought likely to be inadequately addressed by the military health system that separates mental health care of the returning soldier from his or her family&#x27;s care, the latter of whom is generally covered under a contracted, civilian managed-care system.

== Iraqi insurgent casualties ==

Total insurgent deaths are hard to estimate. In 2003, 597 insurgents were killed, according to the U.S. military. From January 2004 through December 2009 (not including May 2004 and March 2009), 23,984 insurgents were estimated to have been killed based on reports from Coalition soldiers on the frontlines. In the two missing months from the estimate, 652 were killed in May 2004, and 45 were killed in March 2009. In 2010, another 676 insurgents were killed. In January and March through October 2011, 451 insurgents were killed. Based on all of these estimates some 26,405 insurgents/militia were killed from 2003, up until late 2011.

However, this number could be low compared to reality as it only counts combat deaths against US-led forces; insurgents also frequently clashed between each other and those killed by noncombat causes are not counted. There have been contradictions between the figures released by the U.S. military and those released by the Iraqi government. For example, the U.S. military&#x27;s number of insurgents killed in 2005, is 3,247, which is in contrast to the Iraqi government&#x27;s figure of 1,734, however, fear of civilians fatalities, numbers were lowered. In 2007, 4,544 militants were killed according to the Iraqi ministries, while the U.S. military claimed 6,747 died. Also, in 2008, 2,028 insurgents were reported killed and in 2009, with the exception of the month of June, 488 were killed according to the Iraqi Defence Ministry. These numbers are also not in line with the U.S. military estimate of some 3,984 killed in 2008 and 2009.

U.S. military- and Iraqi Defence Ministry-provided numbers, including suicide bombers
* 2011 – 451 (not including February &amp; August)
* 2010 – 676
* 2009 – 488 (not including June)
* 2008 – 2,028
* 2007 – 6,747 (U.S. military), 4,544 (Iraqi Defence Ministry)
* 2006 – 3,902
* 2005 – 3,247 (U.S. military), 1,734 (Iraqi Defence Ministry)
* 2004 – 6,801
* 2003 – 603

In addition as of August 22, 2009, approximately 1,719 suicide-bombers had also been reported killed.

* 2009 – 73
* 2008 – 257
* 2007 – 442
* 2006 – 297
* 2005 – 478
* 2004 – 140
* 2003 (from August to December) – 32

Grand total – 21,221–26,405 insurgents dead

On September 28, 2006, an Al Qaeda leader claimed that 4,000 foreign insurgents had been killed in the war.

On June 6, 2008, an Iraqi Army official revealed that about 6,000 Al Qaeda fighters were among the insurgents killed since the start of the war up until April 2008.

The US military also reported on the number of suspected insurgents who were detained, arrested, or captured. From June 2003 through August 2007 the US military reported that 119,752 were detained, compared to 18,832 that had been killed.

== Contractor casualties ==
By July 2007, the Department of Labor recorded 933 deaths of contractors in Iraq. By April 2007, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction stated that the number of civilian contractor deaths on US-funded projects in Iraq was 916. In January 2007, the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; reported that the Pentagon did not track contractor deaths in Iraq. In January 2017, an estimated 7,761 contractors had been injured in Iraq, but their nationality was not known. By the end 2006, civilian contractors suffered &quot;3,367 injuries serious enough to require four or more days off the job.&quot; The Labor Department had these numbers because it tracked workers&#x27; compensation claims by injured workers or families of slain contractors under the federal Defense Base Act.

== Health outcomes ==
By November 2006, there were reports of a significant deterioration of the Iraq health care system as a result of the war.

In 2007, an Iraqi Society of Psychiatrists and WHO study found that 70% of 10,000 primary school students in the Sha&#x27;ab section of north Baghdad are suffering from trauma-related symptoms.

Subsequent articles in The Lancet and Al Jazeera have suggested that the number of cases of birth defects, cancer, miscarriages, illnesses and premature births may have increased dramatically after the first and second Iraq wars, due to the presences of depleted uranium and chemicals introduced during American attacks, especially around Fallujah, Basra and Southern Iraq.

== Total Iraqi casualties ==
Estimates of the total number of Iraqi war-related deaths for certain periods of time are highly disputed.

=== Iraq Living Conditions Survey (2004) ===
A study commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), called the Iraq Living Conditions Survey (ILCS), sampled almost 22,000 households across all Iraqi provinces. It estimated 24,000 war-related violent deaths by May 2004 (with a 95 percent confidence interval from 18,000 to 29,000). This study did not attempt to measure what portion of its estimate was made up of civilians or combatants. It would include Iraqi military killed during the invasion, as well as &quot;insurgents&quot; or other fighters thereafter. This study has been criticized for various reasons. For more info see the section in Lancet surveys of Iraq War casualties that compares the Lancet and UNDP ILCS studies.

=== &quot;Lancet&quot; (2004) ===

The October 2004 &quot;Lancet&quot; study done by public health experts from Johns Hopkins University and published on October 29, 2004, in &quot;The Lancet&quot; medical journal, estimated that 100,000 &quot;excess&quot; Iraqi deaths from all causes had occurred since the U.S. invasion began. The study did not attempt to measure how many of these were civilian, but the study&#x27;s authors have said they believe that the &quot;vast majority&quot; were non-combatants. To arrive at these excess death figures, a survey was taken from 988 Iraqi households in 33 clusters throughout Iraq, in which the residents were asked how many people lived there and how many births and deaths there had been since the war began. They then compared the death rate with the average from the 15 months before the war. Iraqis were found to be 1.5 times more likely to die from all causes after the invasion (rising from 0.5% to 0.79% per year) than in the 15 months preceding the war, producing an estimate of 98,000 excess deaths. This figure excluded data from one cluster in Falluja, which was deemed too much of an outlier for inclusion in the national estimate. If it included data from Falluja, which showed a higher rate of violent deaths than the other 32 clusters combined, the increased death rate would be raised from 1.5 to 2.5-fold, violent deaths would be 58 times more likely with most of them due to air-strikes by coalition forces, and an additional 200,000 fatalities would be estimated.
=== Iraqiyun estimate (2005) ===
The Iraqi non-governmental organisation, Iraqiyun, estimated 128,000 deaths from the invasion until July 2005. A July 2005 United Press International (UPI) article said the number came from the chairman of the Iraqiyun humanitarian organization in Baghdad, Dr. Hatim al-&#x27;Alwani. He said 55 percent of those killed were women, and children aged 12 and under. The UPI article reported: &quot;Iraqiyun obtained data from relatives and families of the deceased, as well as from Iraqi hospitals in all the country&#x27;s provinces. The 128,000 figure only includes those whose relatives have been informed of their deaths and does not include those were abducted, assassinated or simply disappeared.&quot; A 2010 book by Nicolas Davies reported the Iraqiyun estimate, and that Iraqiyun was affiliated with the political party of Interim President Ghazi Al-Yawer. Davies wrote: &quot;The report specified that it included only confirmed deaths reported to relatives, omitting significant numbers of people who had simply disappeared without trace amid the violence and chaos.&quot;

=== &quot;Lancet&quot; (2006) ===

The October 2006 Lancet study by Gilbert Burnham (of Johns Hopkins University) and co-authors estimated total excess deaths (civilian and non-civilian) related to the war of 654,965 excess deaths up to July 2006. The 2006 study was based on surveys conducted between May 20 and July 10, 2006. More households were surveyed than during the 2004 study, allowing for a 95% confidence interval of 392,979 to 942,636 excess Iraqi deaths. Those estimates were far higher than other available tallies at the time.

The Burnham et al. study has been described as the most controversial study in survey research on armed conflict, and its findings have been widely disputed in the academic literature. Shortly after publication, the study&#x27;s estimate and methodology came under criticism from a number of sources, including the United States government, academics, and the Iraq Body Count. At the time, other experts praised the methodology of the study. John Tirman, who commissioned and directed the funding for the study defended the study. A 2008 systematic review of casualty estimates in the Iraq War in the journal &quot;Conflict and Health&quot; concluded that the highest quality studies have used &quot;population-based methods&quot; that have &quot;yielded the highest estimates. A 2016 study described the &quot;Lancet&quot; study as seen &quot;widely viewed among peers as the most rigorous investigations of Iraq War–related mortality among Iraqi civilians,&quot; and argued that part of the criticism &quot;may have been politically motivated.&quot;

A number of peer-reviewed studies criticized the Lancet study on the basis of its methodology and exaggerated casualty numbers. The authors of the Lancet study were also accused of ethical breaches in terms of how the survey was conducted and in how the authors responded to requests for data and information. In 2009, the lead author of the Lancet study was censured by American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) for refusing to provide &quot;several basic facts about&quot; the study. AAPOR had over a 12-year period only formally censured two other individuals. In 2012, Michael Spagat noted that six peer-reviewed studies had identified shortcomings in the Lancet study, and that the Lancet authors had yet to make a substantive response to the critiques. According to Spagat, there is &quot;ample reason&quot; to discard Lancet study estimate. Columbia University statistician Andrew Gelman said in 2014 that &quot;serious flaws have been demonstrated&quot; in the Lancet study, and in 2015 that his impression was that the Lancet study &quot;had pretty much been discredited&quot;. Joshua Goldstein, professor emeritus of International Relations at American University, wrote that critics of the study &quot;have argued convincingly that the sample method was biased.&quot; According to University of Delaware sociologist Joel Best in his book &quot;Stat-Spotting: A Field Guide to Identifying Dubious Data&quot;, &quot;it seems likely that [the Lancet estimate] was too large&quot;. Conflict scholars Nils Petter Gleditsch, Erik Melander and Henrik Urdal said there were &quot;major biases&quot; in the study, leading to oversampling of households affected by violence.

A 2008 study in the &quot;Journal of Peace Research&quot; found that the 2006 Lancet study may have considerably overestimated Iraq War casualties, that the study made &quot;unusual&quot; methodological choices, and called on the 2006 &quot;Lancet&quot; study authors to make all of their data available. The 2008 study was awarded &quot;Article of the Year – 2008&quot; by the &quot;Journal of Peace Research&quot;, with the jury of Lars-Erik Cederman (ETH Zürich), Jon Hovi (University of Oslo) and Sara McLaughlin Mitchell (University of Iowa) writing that the &quot;authors show convincingly that previous studies which are based on a cross-street cluster-sampling algorithm (CSSA) have significantly overestimated the number of casualties in Iraq.&quot; American University political scientist Thomas Zeitzoff said the &quot;Journal of Peace Research&quot; study showed the Lancet study to be &quot;wildly inaccurate&quot; due to its reliance on information from biased samples.

Michael Spagat criticized the 2006 Lancet study in a 2010 article for the journal &quot;Defence and Peace Economics&quot;. Spagat wrote that he found &quot;some evidence relating to data fabrication and falsification&quot; and &quot;this evidence suggests that this survey cannot be considered a reliable or valid contribution towards knowledge about the extent of mortality in Iraq since 2003&quot;. Spagat also chided the Lancet study for &quot;ethical violations to the survey&#x27;s respondents including endangerment, privacy breaches and violations in obtaining informed consent&quot;. In a letter to the journal &quot;Science&quot;, Spagat said that the Lancet study had failed replication in a study by the WHO (the Iraq Family Health Survey). Spagat noted that the lead author of the 2006 study had been censured by the American Association for Public Opinion Research for &quot;repeatedly refusing to disclose the corresponding information for his survey&quot;.

The Iraq Family Health Survey published by WHO researchers in &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; found that the 2006 &quot;Lancet&quot; study results &quot;considerably overestimated the number of violent deaths&quot; and that the results are highly improbable. In comparing the two studies, peace researcher Kristine Eck of Uppsala University notes that the IFHS study which covered the same period as the Lancet survey &quot;was based on a much larger sample (9,345 households compared to Burnham et al&#x27;s 1,849) in far more clusters (1,086 clusters compared to Burnham et al&#x27;s 47).&quot; In comparing the two studies, Joachim Kreutz of Stockholm University and Nicholas Marsh of PRIO said the IFHS study produced &quot;a more reliable estimate.&quot; Oxford University political scientist Adam Roberts wrote that the IFHS study was &quot;more rigorous.&quot;

Burnham, Edward J. Mills, and Frederick M. Burkle noted that the IFHS&#x27;s data indicated that Iraqi mortality increased by a factor of 1.9 following the invasion, compared to the factor of 2.4 found by Burnham et al., which translates to some 433,000 excess Iraqi deaths (violent and non-violent). Timothy R. Gulden considered it implausible that fewer than one-third of these excess deaths would have been violent in nature. Francisco J. Luquero and Rebecca F. Grais argued that the IFHS&#x27;s lengthy survey and use of IBC data as a proxy for particularly dangerous areas likely resulted in an underestimate of violent mortality, while Gulden hypothesized that respondents may have been reluctant to report violent deaths to researchers working with the Iraqi government. In a similar vein, Tirman observed that the Iraqi Health Ministry was affiliated with Shi&#x27;ite sectarians at the time, remarking that there was evidence that many violent deaths may have been recategorized as &quot;non-violent&quot; to avoid government retribution: &quot;For example, the number of deaths by auto accidents rose by four times the pre-invasion rate; had this single figure been included in the violent deaths category, the overall estimate would have risen to 196,000.&quot; Gulden even commented that &quot;the IFHS results are easily in line with the finding of more than 600,000 violent deaths in the study by Burnham et al.&quot; However, the authors of the IFHS rejected such claims: &quot;Because the level of underreporting is almost certainly higher for deaths in earlier time periods, we did not attempt to estimate excess deaths. The excess deaths reported by Burnham et al. included only 8.2% of deaths from nonviolent causes, so inclusion of these deaths will not increase the agreement between the estimates from the IFHS and Burnham et al.&quot;

A graph in the &quot;Lancet&quot; article purportedly demonstrating that its conclusions are in line with violence trends measured by the IBC and Defense Department used cherry-picked data and had two Y-axes; the authors conceded that the graph was flawed, but the &quot;Lancet&quot; never retracted it.

=== Iraq Health Minister estimate (2006) ===
In early November 2006 Iraq&#x27;s Health Minister Ali al-Shemari said that he estimated between 100,000 and 150,000 people had been killed since the March 2003 U.S.-led invasion. The &quot;Taipei Times&quot; reported on his methodology: &quot;Al-Shemari said on Thursday &quot;[, November 9, 2006,]&quot; that he based his figure on an estimate of 100 bodies per day brought to morgues and hospitals – though such a calculation would come out closer to 130,000 in total.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported: &quot;As al-Shemari issued the startling new estimate, the head of the Baghdad central morgue said Thursday he was receiving as many as 60 violent death victims each day at his facility alone. Dr. Abdul-Razzaq al-Obaidi said those deaths did not include victims of violence whose bodies were taken to the city&#x27;s many hospital morgues or those who were removed from attack scenes by relatives and quickly buried according to Muslim custom.&quot;

From a November 9, 2006, &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; article:

Each day we lost 100 persons, that means per month 3,000, per year it&#x27;s 36,000, plus or minus 10 percent&quot;, al-Shemari said. &quot;So by three years, 120,000, half-year 20,000, that means 140,000, plus or minus 10 percent&quot;, he said, explaining how he came to the figures. &quot;This includes all Iraqis killed – police, ordinary people, children&quot;, he said, adding that people who were kidnapped and later found dead were also included in his estimate. He said the figures were compiled by counting bodies brought to &quot;forensic institutes&quot; or hospitals.

From a November 11, 2006, &quot;Taipei Times&quot; article:

An official with the ministry also confirmed the figure yesterday &quot;[November 10, 2006]&quot;, but later said that the estimated deaths ranged between 100,000 and 150,000. &quot;The minister was misquoted. He said between 100,000–150,000 people were killed in three-and-a-half years&quot;, the official said.

=== United Nations (2006) ===
The United Nations reported that 34,452 violent deaths occurred in 2006, based on data from morgues, hospitals, and municipal authorities across Iraq.

=== D3 Systems poll (2007) ===
From February 25 to March 5, 2007, D3 Systems conducted a poll for the BBC, ABC News, ARD and &quot;USA Today&quot;.

ABC News reported: &quot;One in six says someone in their own household has been harmed. ... 53 percent of Iraqis say a close friend or immediate family member has been hurt in the current violence. That ranges from three in 10 in the Kurdish provinces to, in Baghdad, nearly eight in 10.&quot;

The methodology was described thus: &quot;This poll... was conducted February 25 – March 5, 2007, through in-person interviews with a random national sample of 2,212 Iraqi adults, including oversamples in Anbar province, Basra city, Kirkuk and the Sadr City section of Baghdad. The results have a 2.5-point error margin.&quot;

There was a field staff of 150 Iraqis in all. That included 103 interviewers, interviewing selected respondents at 458 locales across the country. &quot;This poll asked about nine kinds of violence (car bombs, snipers or crossfire, kidnappings, fighting among opposing groups or abuse of civilians by various armed forces).&quot;

Question 35 asked: &quot;Have you or an immediate family member – by which I mean someone living in this household – been physically harmed by the violence that is occurring in the country at this time?&quot; Here are the results in percentages:

17% of respondents reported that at least one member of the household had been &quot;physically harmed by the violence that is occurring in the country at this time.&quot; The survey did not ask whether multiple household members had been harmed.

=== Opinion Research Business (ORB) survey (2007, 2008) ===
A September 14, 2007, estimate by Opinion Research Business (ORB), an independent British polling agency, suggested that the total Iraqi violent death toll due to the Iraq War since the U.S.-led invasion was in excess of 1.2 million (1,220,580). These results were based on a survey of 1,499 adults in Iraq from August 12–19, 2007. ORB published an update in January 2008 based on additional work carried out in rural areas of Iraq. Some 600 additional interviews were undertaken and as a result of this the death estimate was revised to 1,033,000 with a given range of 946,000 to 1,120,000.

Participants of the ORB survey were asked the following question: &quot;How many members of your household, if any, have died as a result of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 (ie as a result of violence rather than a natural death such as old age)? Please note that I mean those who were actually living under your roof.&quot;

This ORB estimate has been strongly criticised as exaggerated and ill-founded in peer reviewed literature. According to Carnegie Mellon University historian Jay D. Aronson, &quot;Because this was a number that few people could take seriously (given the incredible magnitude of violence that would have had to take place daily for such a number to be even remotely possible), the ORB study has largely been ignored.&quot;

=== Iraq Family Health Survey (IFHS, 2008) ===
The Iraq Family Health Survey published in 2008 in &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; surveyed 9,345 households across Iraq and was carried out in 2006 and 2007. It estimated 151,000 deaths due to violence (95% uncertainty range, 104,000 to 223,000) from March 2003 through June 2006.

The study was done by the &quot;Iraq Family Health Survey Study Group&quot;, a collaborative effort of six organizations: the Federal Ministry of Health, Baghdad; Kurdistan Ministry of Planning, Erbil; Kurdistan Ministry of Health, Erbil; Central Organization for Statistics and Information Technology, Baghdad; World Health Organization Iraq office, Amman, Jordan; World Health Organization, Geneva.
=== The Associated Press and Health Ministry (2009) ===
In April 2009, the Associated Press reported that Iraq Health Ministry had recorded (via death certificates issued by hospitals and morgues) a total of 87,215 violent deaths of Iraqi citizens between January 1, 2005, and February 28, 2009. The number excludes thousands of missing persons and civilians whose deaths were unrecorded; the government official who provided the data told the AP that if included, the number of dead for that period would be 10 to 20 percent higher.

The Associated Press used the Health Ministry tally and other data (including counts of casualties for 2003–2004, and after March 1, 2009, from hospital sources and media reports, in major part the Iraq Body Count) to estimate that more than 110,600 Iraqis were killed from the start of the war to April 2009. Experts interviewed by the AP found this estimate to be credible and an &quot;important baseline&quot; although necessarily an estimate because of unrecorded deaths, especially in inaccessible areas. While mass graves discovered over time shed more light on deaths in the Iraq War, the AP noted that &quot;how many remain will never be known.&quot;

=== &quot;PLOS Medicine&quot; (2013) ===
A 2013 study by Hagopian et al. in &quot;PLOS Medicine&quot; estimated that 461,000 Iraqis died as a result of the Iraq War. The study used a similar methodology as the 2006 Lancet study and had the lead author of the 2006 study as one of the 12 authors. According to one of the authors, Amy Hagopian, half of the casualties not resulting from violence were due to inadequate treatment of cardiovascular disease. Upon the study&#x27;s publication, Michael Spagat, a critic of the 2006 Lancet study, said that the 2013 study seemed &quot;to fix most of the methodological flaws of the 2006 paper&quot;. Spagat however noted that he found the large confidence interval of the 2013 study disconcerting. Other critics of the 2006 Lancet study mirrored Spagat&#x27;s views, noting that the 2013 study was an improvement but that the large confidence interval was concerning.

A 2017 study by Spagat and Van Weezel replicated the 2013 study by Hagopian et al. and found that the 500,000 casualty estimate by Hagopian et al. was not supported by data. Spagat and Van Weezel said that Hagopian et al. made many methodological errors. Hagopian et al. defended their original study, arguing that Van Weezel and Spagat misunderstood their method. Van Weezel and Spagat answered, saying that the response by Hagopian et al. &quot;avoids the central points, addresses only secondary issues and makes ad hominem attacks.&quot;

=== Some media estimates ===
In December 2005 President Bush said there were 30,000 Iraqi dead. White House spokesman Scott McClellan later said it was &quot;not an official government estimate&quot;, and was based on media reports.

For 2006, a January 2, 2007, Associated Press article reports: &quot;The tabulation by the Iraqi ministries of Health, Defence and Interior, showed that 14,298 civilians, 1,348 police and 627 soldiers had been killed in the violence that raged across the country last year. &quot;The Associated Press&quot; figure, gleaned from daily news reports from Baghdad, arrived at a total of 13,738 deaths.&quot; &quot;The Australian&quot; reports in a January 2, 2007, article: &quot;A figure of 3700 civilian deaths in October &#x27;[2006]&#x27;, the latest tally given by the UN based on data from the Health Ministry and the Baghdad morgue, was branded exaggerated by the Iraqi Government.&quot; Iraqi government estimates include &quot;people killed in bombings and shootings but not deaths classed as &#x27;criminal&#x27;.&quot; Also, they &quot;include no deaths among the many civilians wounded in attacks who may die later from wounds. Nor do they include many people kidnapped whose fate remains unknown.&quot;

A June 25, 2006, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article, &quot;War&#x27;s Iraqi Death Toll Tops 50,000&quot;, reported that their estimate of violent deaths consisted &quot;mostly of civilians&quot; but probably also included security forces and insurgents. It added that, &quot;Many more Iraqis are believed to have been killed but not counted because of serious lapses in recording deaths in the chaotic first year after the invasion, when there was no functioning Iraqi government, and continued spotty reporting nationwide since.&quot; Here is how the &quot;Times&quot; got its number: &quot;The Baghdad morgue received 30,204 bodies from 2003 through mid-2006, while the Health Ministry said it had documented 18,933 deaths from &#x27;military clashes&#x27; and &#x27;terrorist attacks&#x27; from April 5, 2004, to June 1, 2006. Together, the toll reaches 49,137. However, samples obtained from local health departments in other provinces show an undercount that brings the total well beyond 50,000. The figure also does not include deaths outside Baghdad in the first year of the invasion.&quot;

=== Reviews ===

A 2008 review of Iraqi death estimates concluded that 600,000 deaths between 2003 and 2006 likely undercounted total mortality:

A 2016 review came to similar conclusions, stating that estimates of very high Iraqi casualties published in the journal &quot;Lancet&quot; are

According to a 2017 review by Keith Krause of the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva, Switzerland, &quot;the consensus seems to be that around 150,000 people died violently as a result of the fighting between 2003 and 2006.&quot;

== Undercounting ==
Some studies estimating the casualties due to the war in Iraq say there are various reasons why the estimates and counts may be low.

Morgue workers have alleged that official numbers underestimate the death toll. The bodies of some casualties do not end up in morgue and thus may go unrecorded. In 2006, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported: &quot;Police and hospitals often give widely conflicting figures of those killed in major bombings. In addition, death figures are reported through multiple channels by government agencies that function with varying efficiency.&quot;

A January 31, 2008 Perspective in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; contains the following discussion of undercounting Iraqi civilian casualties in household surveys:

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted in 2008 that

research has shown that household surveys typically miss 30 to 50 percent of deaths. One reason is that some families that have suffered violent deaths leave the survey area. ... Some people are kidnapped and disappear, and others turn up months or years later in mass graves. Some are buried or otherwise disposed of without being recorded. In particularly violent areas, local governments have effectively ceased to function, and there are ineffective channels for collecting and passing information between hospitals, morgues and the central government.

The October 2006 &quot;Lancet&quot; study states:

Aside from Bosnia, we can find no conflict situation where passive surveillance [used by the IBC] recorded more than 20% of the deaths measured by population-based methods [used in the &quot;Lancet&quot; studies]. In several outbreaks, disease and death recorded by facility-based methods underestimated events by a factor of ten or more when compared with population-based estimates. Between 1960 and 1990, newspaper accounts of political deaths in Guatemala correctly reported over 50% of deaths in years of low violence but less than 5% in years of highest violence.

The report describes no other specific examples except for this study of Guatemala.

Juan Cole wrote in October 2006 that even though heavy fighting could be observed, none of the Iraqi casualties in the skirmishes were reported on, which suggests undercounting.

A July 28, 2004, opinion piece by Robert Fisk published by &quot;The Independent&quot; reports that &quot;some families bury their dead without notifying the authorities.&quot;

Stephen Soldz, who runs the website &quot;Iraq Occupation and Resistance Report&quot;, wrote in a February 5, 2006, article:

Of course, in conditions of active rebellion, the safer areas accessible to Western reporters are likely to be those under US/Coalition control, where deaths are, in turn, likely to be due to insurgent attacks. Areas of insurgent control, which are likely to be subject to US and Iraqi government attack, for example most of Anbar province, are simply off-limits to these reporters. Thus, the realities of reporting imply that reporters will be witness to a larger fraction of deaths due to insurgents and a lesser proportion of deaths due to US and Iraqi government forces.

An October 19, 2006, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; article reports:

The deaths reported by officials and published in the news media represent only a fraction of the thousands of mutilated bodies winding up in Baghdad&#x27;s overcrowded morgue each month. ... Bodies are increasingly being dumped in and around Baghdad in fields staked out by individual Shiite militias and Sunni insurgent groups. Iraqi security forces often refuse to go to the dumping grounds, leaving the precise number of bodies in those sites unknown. Civilian deaths, unlike those of American troops, often go unrecorded.

&quot;The Australian&quot; reported in January 2007 that Iraqi government casualty estimates do not count deaths classed as &#x27;criminal&#x27;, deaths of civilians who get wounded and die later from the wounds, or kidnap victims who have not been found.

The Iraq Body Count project (IBC) stated in November 2004 that &quot;we have always been quite explicit that our own total is certain to be an underestimate of the true position, because of gaps in reporting or recording&quot;.

=== Underreporting by U.S. authorities ===
An April 2005 article by &quot;The Independent&quot; reports:

A week before she was killed by a suicide bomber, humanitarian worker Marla Ruzicka forced military commanders to admit they did keep records of Iraqi civilians killed by US forces. ... in an essay Ms Ruzicka wrote a week before her death on Saturday and published yesterday, the 28-year-old revealed that a Brigadier General told her it was &quot;standard operating procedure&quot; for US troops to file a report when they shoot a non-combatant. She obtained figures for the number of civilians killed in Baghdad between February 28 and April 5 [2005], and discovered that 29 had been killed in firefights involving US forces and insurgents. This was four times the number of Iraqi police killed.

The December 2006 report of the Iraq Study Group (ISG) found that the United States has filtered out reports of violence in order to disguise its perceived policy failings in Iraq. A December 7, 2006, McClatchy Newspapers article reports that the ISG found that U.S. officials reported 93 attacks or significant acts of violence on one day in July 2006, yet &quot;a careful review of the reports for that single day brought to light more than 1,100 acts of violence.&quot; The article further reports:

The finding confirmed a September 8 McClatchy Newspapers report that U.S. officials excluded scores of people killed in car bombings and mortar attacks from tabulations measuring the results of a drive to reduce violence in Baghdad. By excluding that data, U.S. officials were able to boast that deaths from sectarian violence in the Iraqi capital had declined by more than 52 percent between July and August, McClatchy newspapers reported.

From the ISG report itself:

A murder of an Iraqi is not necessarily counted as an attack. If we cannot determine the source of a sectarian attack, that assault does not make it into the database. A roadside bomb or a rocket or mortar attack that doesn&#x27;t hurt U.S. personnel doesn&#x27;t count.

=== Casualties caused by criminal and political violence ===

In May 2004, Associated Press completed a survey of the morgues in Baghdad and surrounding provinces. The survey tallied violent deaths from May 1, 2003, when President Bush declared an end to major combat operations, through April 30, 2004.

From the AP article:

In Baghdad, a city of about 5.6 million, 4,279 people were recorded killed in the 12 months through April 30, [2004], according to figures provided by Kais Hassan, director of statistics at Baghdad&#x27;s Medicolegal Institute, which administers the city&#x27;s morgues. &quot;Before the war, there was a strong government, strong security. There were a lot of police on the streets and there were no illegal weapons&quot;, he said during an AP reporter&#x27;s visit to the morgue. &quot;Now there are few controls. There is crime, revenge killings, so much violence.&quot; The figure does not include most people killed in big terrorist bombings, Hassan said. The cause of death in such cases is obvious so bodies are usually not taken to the morgue, but given directly to victims&#x27; families. Also, the bodies of killed fighters from groups like the al-Mahdi Army are rarely taken to morgues.

Accidental trauma deaths from car accidents, falls, etc. are not included in the numbers. The article reports that the numbers translate to 76 killings per 100,000 people in Baghdad, compared to 39 in Bogotá, Colombia, 7.5 in New York City, and 2.4 in neighboring Jordan. The article states that there were 3.0 killings per 100,000 people in Baghdad in 2002 (the year before the war). Morgues surveyed in other parts of Iraq also reported large increases in the number of homicides. Karbala, south of Baghdad, increased from an average of one homicide per month in 2002 to an average of 55 per month in the year following the invasion; in Tikrit, north of Baghdad, where there were no homicides in 2002, the rate had grown to an average of 17 per month; in the northern province of Kirkuk, the rate had increased from 3 per month in 2002 to 34 per month in the survey period.

<text>In a spread-spectrum system, the process gain (or &quot;processing gain&quot;) is the ratio of the spread (or RF) bandwidth to the unspread (or baseband) bandwidth. Research suggests that it is one of the important factors in making decisions over the performance of system in jamming environment.

It is usually expressed in decibels (dB). For example, if a 1 kHz signal is spread to 100 kHz, the process gain expressed as a numerical ratio would be / = 100. Or in decibels, 10 log10(100) = 20 dB.

Note that process gain does not reduce the effects of wideband thermal noise. It can be shown that a direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS) system has exactly the same bit error behavior as a non-spread-spectrum system with the same modulation format. Thus, on an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel without interference, a spread system requires the same transmitter power as an unspread system, all other things being equal.

Unlike a conventional communication system, however, a DSSS system does have a certain resistance against narrowband interference, as the interference is not subject to the process gain of the DSSS signal, and hence the signal-to-interference ratio is improved.

In frequency modulation (FM), the processing gain can be expressed as

:formula_1

where:
: &quot;G&quot;p is the processing gain,
: &quot;B&quot;n is the noise bandwidth,
: Δ&quot;f&quot; is the peak frequency deviation,
: &quot;W&quot; is the sinusoidal modulating frequency.

<text>Additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is a basic noise model used in information theory to mimic the effect of many random processes that occur in nature. The modifiers denote specific characteristics:
* Additive because it is added to any noise that might be intrinsic to the information system. 
* White refers to the idea that it has uniform power spectral density across the frequency band for the information system. It is an analogy to the color white which may be realized by uniform emissions at all frequencies in the visible spectrum. 
* Gaussian because it has a normal distribution in the time domain with an average time domain value of zero (Gaussian process).

Wideband noise comes from many natural noise sources, such as the thermal vibrations of atoms in conductors (referred to as thermal noise or Johnson–Nyquist noise), shot noise, black-body radiation from the earth and other warm objects, and from celestial sources such as the Sun. The central limit theorem of probability theory indicates that the summation of many random processes will tend to have distribution called Gaussian or Normal.

AWGN is often used as a channel model in which the only impairment to communication is a linear addition of wideband or white noise with a constant spectral density (expressed as watts per hertz of bandwidth) and a Gaussian distribution of amplitude. The model does not account for fading, frequency selectivity, interference, nonlinearity or dispersion. However, it produces simple and tractable mathematical models which are useful for gaining insight into the underlying behavior of a system before these other phenomena are considered.

The AWGN channel is a good model for many satellite and deep space communication links. It is not a good model for most terrestrial links because of multipath, terrain blocking, interference, etc. However, for terrestrial path modeling, AWGN is commonly used to simulate background noise of the channel under study, in addition to multipath, terrain blocking, interference, ground clutter and self interference that modern radio systems encounter in terrestrial operation.

==Channel capacity==
The AWGN channel is represented by a series of outputs formula_1 at discrete-time event index formula_2. formula_1 is the sum of the input formula_4 and noise, formula_5, where formula_5 is independent and identically distributed and drawn from a zero-mean normal distribution with variance formula_7 (the noise). The formula_5 are further assumed to not be correlated with the formula_4.
:formula_10
:formula_11

The capacity of the channel is infinite unless the noise formula_7 is nonzero, and the formula_4 are sufficiently constrained. The most common constraint on the input is the so-called &quot;power&quot; constraint, requiring that for a codeword formula_14 transmitted through the channel, we have:

:formula_15
where formula_16 represents the maximum channel power.
Therefore, the channel capacity for the power-constrained channel is given by:

:formula_17

where formula_18 is the distribution of formula_19. Expand formula_20, writing it in terms of the differential entropy:
:formula_21

But formula_19 and formula_23 are independent, therefore:
:formula_24

Evaluating the differential entropy of a Gaussian gives:
:formula_25

Because formula_19 and formula_23 are independent and their sum gives formula_28:

:formula_29

From this bound, we infer from a property of the differential entropy that

:formula_30

Therefore, the channel capacity is given by the highest achievable bound on the mutual information:
:formula_31

Where formula_20 is maximized when:

:formula_33

Thus the channel capacity formula_34 for the AWGN channel is given by:
:formula_35

=== Channel capacity and sphere packing ===
Suppose that we are sending messages through the channel with index ranging from formula_36 to formula_37, the number of distinct possible messages. If we encode the formula_37 messages to formula_39 bits, then we define the rate formula_40 as:

:formula_41

A rate is said to be achievable if there is a sequence of codes so that the maximum probability of error tends to zero as formula_39 approaches infinity. The capacity formula_34 is the highest achievable rate.

Consider a codeword of length formula_39 sent through the AWGN channel with noise level formula_7. When received, the codeword vector variance is now formula_7, and its mean is the codeword sent. The vector is very likely to be contained in a sphere of radius formula_47 around the codeword sent. If we decode by mapping every message received onto the codeword at the center of this sphere, then an error occurs only when the received vector is outside of this sphere, which is very unlikely.

Each codeword vector has an associated sphere of received codeword vectors which are decoded to it and each such sphere must map uniquely onto a codeword. Because these spheres therefore must not intersect, we are faced with the problem of sphere packing. How many distinct codewords can we pack into our formula_39-bit codeword vector? The received vectors have a maximum energy of formula_49 and therefore must occupy a sphere of radius formula_50. Each codeword sphere has radius formula_51. The volume of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional sphere is directly proportional to formula_52, so the maximum number of uniquely decodeable spheres that can be packed into our sphere with transmission power &quot;P&quot; is:

:formula_53

By this argument, the rate &quot;R&quot; can be no more than formula_54.

===Achievability===
In this section, we show achievability of the upper bound on the rate from the last section.

A codebook, known to both encoder and decoder, is generated by selecting codewords of length &quot;n&quot;, i.i.d. Gaussian with variance formula_55 and mean zero. For large n, the empirical variance of the codebook will be very close to the variance of its distribution, thereby avoiding violation of the power constraint probabilistically.

Received messages are decoded to a message in the codebook which is uniquely jointly typical. If there is no such message or if the power constraint is violated, a decoding error is declared.

Let formula_56 denote the codeword for message formula_2, while formula_58 is, as before the received vector. Define the following three events:

# Event formula_59:the power of the received message is larger than formula_16.
# Event formula_61: the transmitted and received codewords are not jointly typical.
# Event formula_62: formula_63 is in formula_64, the typical set where formula_65, which is to say that the incorrect codeword is jointly typical with the received vector.

An error therefore occurs if formula_59, formula_61 or any of the formula_68 occur. By the law of large numbers, formula_69 goes to zero as n approaches infinity, and by the joint Asymptotic Equipartition Property the same applies to formula_70. Therefore, for a sufficiently large formula_39, both formula_69 and formula_70 are each less than formula_74. Since formula_56 and formula_76 are independent for formula_65, we have that formula_56 and formula_58 are also independent. Therefore, by the joint AEP, formula_80. This allows us to calculate formula_81, the probability of error as follows:

: formula_82

Therefore, as &quot;n&quot; approaches infinity, formula_81 goes to zero and formula_84. Therefore, there is a code of rate R arbitrarily close to the capacity derived earlier.

=== Coding theorem converse ===
Here we show that rates above the capacity formula_85 are not achievable.

Suppose that the power constraint is satisfied for a codebook, and further suppose that the messages follow a uniform distribution. Let formula_86 be the input messages and formula_87 the output messages. Thus the information flows as:

formula_88

Making use of Fano&#x27;s inequality gives:

formula_89 where formula_90 as formula_91

Let formula_4 be the encoded message of codeword index &quot;i&quot;. Then:

: formula_93

Let formula_94 be the average power of the codeword of index i:

:formula_95

where the sum is over all input messages formula_96. formula_4 and formula_5 are independent, thus the expectation of the power of formula_1 is, for noise level formula_7:

:formula_101

And, if formula_1 is normally distributed, we have that
:formula_103

Therefore,

: formula_104

We may apply Jensen&#x27;s equality to formula_105, a concave (downward) function of &quot;x&quot;, to get:
:formula_106

Because each codeword individually satisfies the power constraint, the average also satisfies the power constraint. Therefore,

which we may apply to simplify the inequality above and get:
:formula_108

Therefore, it must be that formula_109. Therefore, &quot;R&quot; must be less than a value arbitrarily close to the capacity derived earlier, as formula_90.

==Effects in time domain==
In serial data communications, the AWGN mathematical model is used to model the timing error caused by random jitter (RJ).

The graph to the right shows an example of timing errors associated with AWGN. The variable Δ&quot;t&quot; represents the uncertainty in the zero crossing. As the amplitude of the AWGN is increased, the signal-to-noise ratio decreases. This results in increased uncertainty Δ&quot;t&quot;.

When affected by AWGN, the average number of either positive-going or negative-going zero crossings per second at the output of a narrow bandpass filter when the input is a sine wave is

: formula_111

where
: &quot;ƒ&quot;0 = the center frequency of the filter,
: &quot;B&quot; = the filter bandwidth,
: SNR = the signal-to-noise power ratio in linear terms.

==Effects in phasor domain==
In modern communication systems, bandlimited AWGN cannot be ignored. When modeling bandlimited AWGN in the phasor domain, statistical analysis reveals that the amplitudes of the real and imaginary contributions are independent variables which follow the Gaussian distribution model. When combined, the resultant phasor&#x27;s magnitude is a Rayleigh-distributed random variable, while the phase is uniformly distributed from 0 to 2.

The graph to the right shows an example of how bandlimited AWGN can affect a coherent carrier signal. The instantaneous response of the noise vector cannot be precisely predicted, however, its time-averaged response can be statistically predicted. As shown in the graph, we confidently predict that the noise phasor will reside about 38% of the time inside the 1&quot;σ&quot; circle, about 86% of the time inside the 2&quot;σ&quot; circle, and about 98% of the time inside the 3&quot;σ&quot; circle.

<text>Guimarotodon is an extinct mammal of the Upper Jurassic. It was a relatively early member of the also extinct order of Multituberculata. It made its living nibbling plants as great big, and small, dinosaurs roamed the world. (For the technically minded, suborder Plagiaulacida, family Paulchoffatiidae.)

&quot;Guimarotodon&quot; (&quot;Guimarota tooth&quot;) Hahn G, 1969. &quot;&quot;Guimarotodon&quot; Hahn 1969 exhibits a more slender Corpus mandibulae than either &quot;Paulchoffatia&quot; or &quot;Meketibolodon&quot;. The most conspicuous character of this genus is the morphology of the P3-4 and the M1.&quot;. The Corpus mandibulae is the part of the jaw below the tooth row. P3-4 are upper premolars, whilst M1 is an upper molar tooth.

&quot;The incisor is relatively little curved and its root is of similar length as that of &quot;Meketibolodon&quot; and extends to underneath the posterior premolars.&quot; (Both quotations from Hahn &amp; Hahn 2000, p. 105-106).

== &quot;Guimarotodon leiriensis&quot; ==
&quot;Guimarotodon leiriensis&quot; is found in Kimmeridgian (Upper Jurassic) of Guimarota, Portugal. Classification is based on three lower jaws. The species name refers to the local town of Leiria.

<doc id="202099" wikidata="Q15179022" url="?curid=202099" title="11th Hussars">
<text>The 11th Hussars (Prince Albert&#x27;s Own) was a cavalry regiment of the British Army established in 1715. It saw service for three centuries including the First World War and Second World War but then amalgamated with the 10th Royal Hussars (Prince of Wales&#x27; Own) to form the Royal Hussars in 1969.

==History==

===Formation to end 18th century===
The regiment was formed at Colchester in July 1715 by Philip Honeywood as Honeywood&#x27;s Regiment of Dragoons, one of 16 raised in response to the 1715 Jacobite rising. It fought in the Battle of Preston that ended the revolt in England and while many of these formations were disbanded in 1718, Honeywood&#x27;s remained in being.

During the Jacobite rising of 1745, the regiment took part in the December 1745 Clifton Moor Skirmish, allegedly the last military engagement on English soil, as well as Battle of Culloden in April 1746, often cited as the last pitched battle on British soil. After 1751, regiments were numbered, rather than being named after the current Colonel, and it became the 11th Regiment of Dragoons.

When the Seven Years&#x27; War broke out in 1756, the regiment took part in the 1758 raids on St Malo and Cherbourg. Attempting to divert French forces from Hanover, they failed to achieve this aim and the regiment was shipped to Germany in May 1760 as part of the Marquess of Granby&#x27;s cavalry corps, winning its first battle honour in July at Warburg. It was also present in the Allied victory at Villinghausen in July 1761, which forced the French onto the defensive and ultimately led to the Treaty of Paris in 1763.

In 1755, each dragoon regiment added a reconnaissance or &#x27;light&#x27; troop; in February 1779, these were detached, that from the 11th helping form the 19th Light Dragoons, which in 1862 became the 19th Royal Hussars. While dragoons had previously been mounted infantry, as part of a tactical rethink, the 11th was re-designated in 1783 as &#x27;light cavalry&#x27; and became the 11th Regiment of Light Dragoons.

During the French Revolutionary Wars, two squadrons of the 11th Light Dragoons took part in the Duke of York&#x27;s Low Countries campaign in 1793-95, including the action at Famars and the sieges of Valenciennes and Landrecies. It was also involved in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland, including the October 1799 battles of Alkmaar and Castricum.

===The 19th century===
With the exception of a short spell in Egypt during the victorious campaign of 1801, the regiment did not see active service again until it was sent to Portugal in April 1811, where it joined the Peninsular War campaign. In August, a ten-man piquet was surprised and captured at San Martín de Trevejo in Spain, an incident that may have given rise to the regiment&#x27;s nickname, &quot;The Cherry Pickers&quot;, which tradition associates with a mishap occurring in the vicinity of a cherry orchard. It fought at Badajoz in April 1812 and the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812 before returning to Britain. During the campaign of 1815, it was part of Vandeleur&#x27;s 4th Cavalry Brigade, fighting at Quatre Bras and Waterloo.

In 1819, the regiment moved to India, where it remained until 1836. It was deployed at the Siege of Bharatpur between 1825 and 1826. Shortly before returning to Britain, the Earl of Cardigan became lieutenant-colonel; embarked on a series of changes, which were intended to increase regimental prestige but resulted in a number of highly publicised disputes, including the so-called &#x27;Black Bottle&#x27; affair.

In 1840, the 11th Light Dragoons served as escort to Prince Albert on his arrival in England to marry Queen Victoria. She appointed Prince Albert colonel of the regiment. and granted them the title 11th (Prince Albert&#x27;s Own) Hussars. Prince Albert&#x27;s interests included military tactics and equipment and he helped design the regiment&#x27;s new uniforms. By coincidence, the ornate Hussar uniform included crimson or &quot;cherry&quot; coloured trousers, unique among British regiments and worn ever since in most orders of uniform other than combat and working dress.

The regiment served in the Crimean War, as part of the Light Brigade commanded by Cardigan, now a Major General and fought at the Battle of Alma in September 1854. It was also involved in the Charge of the Light Brigade in October 1854; due to miscommunication, Cardigan led the brigade against unbroken and more numerous Russian forces and while able to withdraw to its starting position, it suffered heavy losses as a result.

The 11th lost three officers and 55 men in the debacle, while Lieutenant Dunn was awarded the Victoria Cross for rescuing two members of his troop. Edward Woodham of the 11th Hussars later acted as chairman of the organising committee for the 21st Anniversary dinner held at Alexandra Palace for survivors of the Charge. The regiment was renamed the 11th (or Prince Albert&#x27;s Own) Hussars in 1861. A detachment took part in the 1884 Nile Expedition and during the Second Boer War, it participated in the February 1900 Relief of Ladysmith.

In 1911 Prince Albert&#x27;s great-grandson Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia became colonel-in-chief of the regiment. He was removed in October 1914 following the outbreak of the First World War.

=== The First World War ===

The regiment landed in France as part of the 1st Cavalry Brigade in the 1st Cavalry Division in August 1914 for service on the Western Front with the British Expeditionary Force. The regiment took part in the Great Retreat and the regiment, working with the 2nd Dragoon Guards, conducted a cavalry charge which led to the capture of eight guns at Néry in September 1914. In an action during the Battle of Messines in October 1914 a squadron from the regiment endured a heavy German bombardment that left many of its soldiers buried in a trench while another squadron from the regiment used a vantage point at the top of a building to train a machine gun on the Germans. At the Second Battle of Ypres in April 1915 the regiment, working with the Durham Light Infantry and 9th Lancers, held the village of Hooge despite being under attack from the German forces using poison gas. In spring 1918 the commanding officer of the regiment Colonel Rowland Anderson led a bayonet assault at Sailly-Laurette which, taking the Germans by surprise, led to them being completely repulsed.

===The inter-war years===

The regiment was renamed the 11th Hussars (Prince Albert&#x27;s Own) in 1921; it became the first British cavalry regiment to become mechanized in 1928 and it became involved in suppressing the Arab revolt in Palestine in 1936.

===The Second World War===

The regiment, which had been located in Egypt when the war started, deployed as part of the divisional troops of the 7th Armoured Division and conducted raids on Italian positions in Italian Libya using armoured cars during the Western Desert Campaign. It captured Fort Capuzzo in June 1940 and, in an ambush east of Bardia, captured General Lastucci, the Engineer-in-Chief of the Italian Tenth Army.

Following the Italian invasion of Egypt in September 1940, the regiment took part in the British counterattack called Operation Compass, launched against Italian forces first in Egypt, then Libya. It was part of an &quot;ad hoc&quot; combat unit called Combeforce, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel John Combe, that cut the retreating Tenth Army off and led to their surrender at the Battle of Beda Fomm in February 1941. The regiment fought at the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942. The regiment took part in the Allied invasion of Italy in September 1943 and, after the Normandy landings in June 1944, took part in the North-West Europe Campaign.

=== Post-war ===

The regiment was posted to Wavell Barracks in Berlin in 1945 and, after tours at various locations in Lower Saxony including Jever, Delmenhorst, Osnabrück and Wesendorf, it returned home in March 1953. It deployed to Johor Bahru in Malaya in July 1953 during the Malayan Emergency. After returning home, it moved to Hadrian&#x27;s Camp in Carlisle as an Armoured Basic Training Unit in August 1956, then to Lisanelly Barracks in Omagh back into the armoured reconnaissance role in August 1959, and then deployed to Aden in November 1960 shortly before the Aden Emergency. It returned to England in November 1961 and then moved to Haig Barracks in Hohne in October 1962 where, after becoming the first regiment to use Chieftain tanks in regular service in 1967, it remained until returning home again in January 1969. The regiment was amalgamated with the 10th Royal Hussars (Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own), to form the Royal Hussars on 25 October 1969.

<text>The axodines are a group of unicellular stramenopiles that includes silicoflagellate and rhizochromulinid algae, actinomonad heterotrophic flagellates and actinophryid heliozoa. Alternative classifications treat the dictyochophytes as heterokont algae, or as Chrysophyceae. Other overlapping taxonomic concepts include the Actinochrysophyceae, Actinochrysea or Dictyochophyceae &quot;sensu lato&quot;. The grouping was proposed on the basis of ultrastructural similarities, and is consistent with subsequent molecular comparisons.

The Axodine grouping was unusual in breaking with the traditions of botanical and protozoological taxonomy to include the actinophryid heliozoa as part of the lineage that also contained the pedinellid algae along with colorless relatives such as &quot;Actinomonas&quot;, Pteridomonas, and &quot;Ciliophrys&quot;; the axodines further included the silicoflagellates, and Rhizochromulinales. This followed a growing consensus that the actinophryid heliozoa were not related to other types of heliozoa.

==Characteristics==
The name points to a character that is deemed to be synapomorphic for the group: that is the microtubular arrays that extend from the surface of the nucleus. Many flagellated forms have a single emergent flagellum, that lacks the root structure found in related chrysophytes. 
==Classification and history==
The traditional botanical treatment of the group follows

===Order Dictyochales===

The most notable group is the silicoflagellates, marine plankton that form siliceous skeletons and are well known as fossils.

===Order Pedinellales===

Most other axodines form a group variously called the pedinellids.

===Order Rhizochromulinales===
In addition to the silicoflagellates and actinodines, the marine amoeboid &quot;Rhizochromulina marina&quot; is included here based on the structure of its zoospores. It is considered closer to the latter group than the former.

<text>The military history of the United Kingdom in World War II covers the Second World War against the Axis powers, starting on 3 September 1939 with the declaration of war by the United Kingdom and France, followed by the UK&#x27;s Dominions, Crown colonies and protectorates on Nazi Germany in response to the invasion of Poland by Germany. There was little, however, the Anglo-French alliance could do or did do to help Poland. The Phoney War culminated in April 1940 with the German invasion of Denmark and Norway. Winston Churchill became prime minister and head of a coalition government in May 1940. The defeat of other European countries followed – Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and France – alongside the British Expeditionary Force which led to the Dunkirk evacuation in June 1940.

Britain and its Empire continued the war against Germany. Churchill engaged industry, scientists and engineers to advise and support the government and the military in the prosecution of the war effort. Germany&#x27;s planned invasion of the UK was averted by the Royal Air Force denying the Luftwaffe air superiority in the Battle of Britain, and by its marked inferiority in naval power. Subsequently, urban areas in Britain suffered heavy bombing during the Blitz in late 1940 and early 1941. The Royal Navy sought to blockade Germany and protect merchant ships in the Battle of the Atlantic. The Army counter-attacked in the Mediterranean and Middle East, including the North-African and East-African campaigns, and in the Balkans.

The United Kingdom and allied countries signed the Declaration of St James&#x27;s Palace in June 1941 committing to no separate peace with Germany and setting out principles to serve as the basis of a future peace. Churchill agreed an alliance with the Soviet Union in July and began sending supplies to the USSR. By August, Churchill and American President Franklin Roosevelt had drafted the Atlantic Charter to define goals for the post-war world. In December, the Empire of Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific including an attack on the US fleet at Pearl Harbor. Britain and America declared war on Japan, opening the Pacific War. The Grand Alliance of the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union was formed and Britain and America agreed a Europe first grand strategy for the war. The Declaration by United Nations drafted by Roosevelt and Churchill in Washington in December 1941 formalised the Allies of World War II. The UK, the US and their Allies suffered many disastrous defeats in the Asia-Pacific war during the first six months of 1942. The Eastern Front between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany became the largest theatre of war ever to take place.

There were eventual hard-fought victories in 1943 in the North-African campaign, led by General Bernard Montgomery, and in the subsequent Italian campaign. British forces played major roles in the production of Ultra signals intelligence, the strategic bombing of Germany, and the Normandy landings of June 1944. The liberation of Europe followed on 8 May 1945, achieved by the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom and other Allied countries. The Battle of the Atlantic was the longest continuous military campaign of the War.

The Pacific War, fought primarily between China, the United States and Japan, was geographically the largest theater of the war. In the South-East Asian theatre, the British Eastern Fleet conducted strikes in the Indian Ocean. The British Army led the Burma campaign to drive Japan out of the British colony. Involving a million troops at its peak, drawn primarily from British India, the campaign was finally successful in mid-1945. The British Pacific Fleet took part in the Battle of Okinawa and the final naval strikes on Japan. British scientists contributed to the Manhattan Project to design a nuclear weapon. The decision to use these weapons was made by the Anglo-American Combined Policy Committee and led to the surrender of Japan, which was announced on 15 August 1945 and signed on 2 September 1945.

For the domestic history see United Kingdom home front during World War II.

==Background==

Although the UK had increased military spending and funding prior to 1939 in response to the increasing strength of Germany under the Nazi Party, its forces were still weak by comparison, especially the British Army. Only the Royal Navy – at the time still the largest in the world – was of a greater strength than its German counterpart. The British Army only had nine divisions available for war, whereas Germany had seventy-eight and France eighty-six.

Nonetheless, &quot;Britain was a very wealthy country, formidable in arms, ruthless in pursuit of its interests and sitting at the heart of a global production system from its empire.&quot; After becoming Prime Minister in 1940, Winston Churchill engaged industry, scientists and engineers to advise and support the government and the military in the prosecution of the war effort. Much of the scientific work that led to technology that determined the outcome of the war, such as radar, was done before 1940, and shared with the Americans that year through the Tizard Mission which led to extensive Allied technological cooperation. Several technologies invented in Britain proved critical to the military and were widely manufactured by the Allies during the Second World War. The Manhattan Project, however, was undertaken during the war beginning in 1942, to which the British contribution included the Tube Alloys work since 1941. Under the clause of the 1943 Quebec Agreement that specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent, the atomic bombing of Japan was recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee.

==Beginning of the conflict==
Anticipating a German attack, the Polish Navy implemented the Peking Plan in late August and early September 1939, moving three modern destroyers, , , and to Britain; the ships served alongside (and under the command of) the Royal Navy for the remainder of the war.

On 3 September, the UK and France declared war on Germany as obliged by the Anglo-Polish military alliance. The declaration was made 24 hours after the UK had issued an ultimatum to Germany to withdraw all German forces from Poland. After the fall of Poland, the Royal Navy was strengthened by the arrival of two Polish submarines and . The Polish Navy in the United Kingdom was then supplemented with leased British ships.

The British Army immediately began dispatching the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to support France. At first only regular troops from the pre-war Army made up its numbers. In 1940, however, men of the Territorial Army (TA) divisions being mobilized in the UK were sent. In the end, the BEF had I, II and III Corps under its command, controlling 200,000 men. The Royal Air Force (RAF) also sent significant forces to France at the start of hostilities. Some were French Army cooperation squadrons to help with matters like reconnaissance for the French Army. Others were Hawker Hurricane squadrons from RAF Fighter Command. Separately, Bomber Command sent the Advanced Air Striking Force, composed of squadrons flying the Fairey Battle and other machines that did not have the range to reach Germany from the UK.

During the Phoney War, the RAF carried out small bombing raids and a large number of propaganda leaflet raids (code-named &quot;Nickels&quot;) and the Royal Navy imposed a coastal blockade on Germany.

The British army began the war with a paper force of 900,000 men 232,000 active regulars, 185,000 regular reserves, 34,000 in the militia, 428,000 in the territorial army and 21,000 in the territorial army reserve however of the many non active regular formations a total manpower amount of 480,000 was available in September 1939 thus the actual force was 700,000 and this figure includes those who were in training or filling non-combat roles at the outbreak of hostilities.

==Western and northern Europe, 1940 and 1941==

===Norwegian campaign===
Norway loomed large in German strategy because of the great iron ore deposits in northern Sweden and the long seacoast that would preclude a blockade of the sort that hurt Germany in the First World War. Predicting correctly that the UK would make a preemptive move against neutral Norway to stop the flow of ore from Narvik, Adolf Hitler ordered an invasion to begin on 9 April 1940. The Wehrmacht succeeded in their mission, landing a large force at vital strategic points in Norway. British land forces were quickly sent to Norway, landing in the centre at Åndalsnes and at Namsos and in the north of the country at Narvik. The Luftwaffe deterred landings farther south.

British troops made amphibious landings at Namsos during April 1940 in an effort to stop the Germans advancing North. The British Forces&#x27; attacks south were stopped and they were soon surrounded in the town of Namsos. The British were faced with attacks from the Luftwaffe and increasing difficulty with landing fresh troops and supplies from the sea. General De Wiart was given orders to evacuate his forces on 28 April. All British troops were evacuated by 4 May 1940.

In central Norway, Royal Navy aircraft-carriers and RAF fighter squadrons could not keep the established bases secure, and the British had to evacuate them. In the north, the Germans were driven out of Narvik after they had captured it. However, as Luftwaffe aircraft came into range with the German advances, it was again found to be impossible to sustain bases in the face of aerial threat. British forces in Narvik were withdrawn as well.

As a consequence of the loss of Norway and Denmark, the Royal Navy commenced a pre-emptive occupation of the Faroe Islands on 12 April 1940.

On 10 May 1940, the Royal Navy occupied Iceland to install naval and air bases on this Atlantic island.

===The Battle of France===

Following the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, the British Expeditionary Force was sent to the Franco-Belgian border in mid-September. The first deployment was completed by 11 October 1939 at which point 158,000 men had been transported to France. Over the next few months, troops, materials and vehicles continued to arrive in France and Belgium and by 13 March 1940 the BEF had doubled in size to 316,000 men.

This period leading up to 10 May 1940 was known as the Phoney War, as there was little combat apart from minor clashes of reconnaissance patrols. The Allied generals believed that time was on their side, and hoped to weaken Germany by blockade before going on the offensive.

On 10 May the stalemated Phoney War ended with a sweeping German invasion of the Benelux. German troops entered France through the Ardennes on 13 May. Most Allied forces were in Flanders, anticipating a re-run of the World War I Schlieffen Plan. The push by the German Army Group A towards the coast combined with the approach of Army Group B from the northeast left the BEF surrounded on three sides and cut off from their supply depots by 21 May. The British forces attempted to stop the offensive and launched counter-attacks including at Arras on 21 May. The BEF was unable to repel the Germans and it became clear that the Channel ports were threatened. Fresh troops were rushed from England to defend Boulogne and Calais, but after hard fighting, both ports were in German hands by 26 May (see Battle of Boulogne (1940) and Siege of Calais (1940)). Gort ordered that the BEF should withdraw to Dunkirk, the only viable port remaining, to facilitate evacuation. In total, 338,226 troops were pulled off the beaches, of which 230,000 were British. However, almost all the army&#x27;s equipment had been abandoned in France — many soldiers were unable to bring even their rifles.

Despite failing to destroy the BEF, the Germans had succeeded in cutting off British formations from reaching the evacuation at Dunkirk. They were; the Saar Force, chiefly composed of the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, most of the 1st Armoured Division, and an improvised force called Beauman Division. Churchill and the Chiefs-of-Staff originally decided to form a &quot;Second BEF&quot; that would help defend the rest of France but General Alan Brooke managed to persuade them that the remaining forces faced annihilation if they tried to fight on. Churchill ordered that all British troops should be evacuated from France without delay. From 15 to 25 June 191,870 allied troops (144,171 of them British) and a large amount of their equipment were rescued from eight major sea ports on the southwest coast of France in Operation Aerial. The only serious setback was the bombing of the troopship &quot;Lancastria&quot; off St Nazaire, resulting in the deaths of about 4,000 of those on board; the exact number has never been established.

As a result of the Germans&#x27; Blitzkrieg tactics and superior German communications, the Battle of France was shorter than virtually all prewar Allied thought could have conceived, with France surrendering after six weeks. The UK and its Empire were left to stand alone. When France fell the position changed drastically. A combination of the French, German and Italian navies could potentially deny the UK command of the Atlantic and starve the country into submission. Unable to discover whether the terms of the French surrender would permit Germany the use of French warships, it was decided that their use must be denied to the enemy. Those that had taken refuge in British ports were simply taken over (many volunteered to join the British). See below for details of how the British neutralized the French Mediterranean Fleet.

During the Battle of France, the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain resigned, to be replaced by Winston Churchill, who had opposed negotiation with Hitler all along.

==The war at sea==
The Royal Navy was far more powerful than the German &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. Its main roles were to keep:
* the North Atlantic open, despite German submarines
* the Mediterranean open to the Allies and closed to the Germans and Italians
* routes open through the Indian Ocean to India and Australia

The Japanese Navy was stronger than the German naval forces, however, and in the Pacific it confronted primarily the United States Navy while dealing sharp blows to the Royal Navy in 1941–42 in the area from Singapore to Ceylon.

===Opening moves===

At the start of the war the British and French expected to have command of the seas, as they believed their navies were superior to those of Germany and Italy. The British and French immediately began a blockade of Germany, which had little effect on German industry. The German navy began to attack British shipping with both surface ships and U-boats, sinking within hours of the declaration of war. The German cruiser was cornered in the Battle of the River Plate by the British and New Zealand navies and its captain scuttled her.

===Battle of the Atlantic===

The Battle of the Atlantic was the contest between merchant ships, usually in convoys, and the German submarine force. The battle ebbed and flowed, until the Allies gained a decisive advantage in 1943 using destroyers, destroyer escorts, air surveillance, new depth charges, and Ultra intelligence that revealed the location of German wolfpacks.

====First &#x27;Happy Time&#x27;====

With the fall of France in June 1940, ports such as Brest, France were quickly turned into large submarine bases from which British trade could be attacked. This resulted in a huge rise in sinkings of British shipping. The period between the fall of France and the British containment of the threat was referred to as the First Happy Time by the U-boat commanders.

By 1941, the United States and Canada (a British Dominion) were taking an increasing part in the war. British forces had occupied Iceland shortly after Denmark fell to the Germans in 1940, the US was persuaded to provide forces to relieve British troops on the island. American warships began escorting convoys to Iceland, and had several hostile encounters with U-boats. The United States Navy also helped escort the main Atlantic convoys.

More American help came in the form of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement in September 1940. Fifty old American destroyers were handed over to the Royal Navy in exchange for 99-year leases on certain British bases in the western hemisphere. Although plagued with mechanical problems, these old ships performed anti-submarine patrols in 1941–42.

In addition, personnel training in the RN improved as the realities of the battle became obvious. For instance, the training regime of Vice Admiral Gilbert O. Stephenson is credited in improving personnel standards to a significant degree.

====Second &#x27;Happy Time&#x27;====

The Japanese declarations of war in December 1941 made it a global war. German U-boats conducted a highly successful campaign against traffic along the American east coast. A proportion of the ships sunk were en route to assembly points for convoys to the UK. German sailors called this the &quot;second happy time&quot;. It came to an end when a convoy system operated along the coast and adequate anti-submarine measures were employed.

====Success against the U-boats====

The institution of an interlocking convoy system on the American coast and in the Caribbean Sea in mid-1942 created an enormous drop in attacks in those areas. Attention shifted back to the Atlantic convoys. Matters were serious, but not critical throughout much of 1942.

The winter weather provided a respite in early 1943, but in the spring, large &quot;wolf packs&quot; of U-boats attacked convoys and scored big successes without taking large losses in return. However, in May 1943 a sudden turnaround happened. Two convoys were attacked by large wolf packs and suffered losses. Yet unlike earlier in the year the attacking submarines were also mauled. After those battles merchant ship losses plummeted and U-boat losses rocketed, forcing Karl Dönitz to withdraw his forces from the Atlantic. They were never again to pose the same threat. What had changed was a sudden convergence of technologies. The large gap in the middle of the Atlantic that had been unreachable by aircraft was closed by long range B-24 Liberator aircraft. Centimetric radar came into service, greatly improving detection and nullifying German radar warning equipment. The introduction of the Leigh Light enabled accurate attacks on U-boats re-charging their batteries on the surface at night. With convoys securely protected there were enough resources to allow escort carrier groups to aggressively hunt U-boats.

====Arctic convoys====
The Arctic convoys travelled from the US and the UK to the northern ports of the Soviet Union – Arkhangelsk and Murmansk.

85 Allied merchant vessels and 16 Royal Navy warships were lost. The Germans committed significant naval and air assets and lost one battlecruiser, at least 30 U-boats, and a large number of aircraft. Particularly during the winter of 1941–2, meaningful material aid was provided to the Soviet Union via the Arctic route.

===The Mediterranean===
The Royal Navy battled the Italian Navy for three years for control of the Mediterranean. The Germans also took part in the campaign, primarily by sending U-boats into the Mediterranean, but latterly by controlling the few remaining Axis naval forces after the Italian surrender.

At the outset of the war, the area was numerically dominated by the British and French navies, and Italy was initially a neutral power astride communications in the centre of the area. The situation changed vastly with the fall of France and the declaration of war by Italy. While the British Mediterranean Fleet based at Alexandria controlled the eastern end of the Mediterranean, there was a need to replace French naval power in the west. To do this Force H was formed at Gibraltar. The British Government was still concerned that the remaining French ships would be used by the Axis powers. Consequently, they took steps to neutralise it.

At Alexandria, relations between the French and British commanders, Admirals René-Émile Godfroy and Andrew Cunningham, were good. The French squadron there was impounded in the port. In the western basin things did not go so smoothly. The bulk of the French fleet was at Mers-el-Kebir in North Africa. Force H steamed there to confront the French with terms. Those terms were all rejected and so the French fleet was attacked and heavily damaged by Force H. The Vichy French government broke off all ties with the British as a result. (See destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir.)

====Battle of Taranto====

The Italian battle fleet dominated the centre of the Mediterranean and so the Royal Navy hatched a plan to cripple it. On 11 November 1940, the Royal Navy crippled or destroyed three Italian battleships in port by using carrier borne aircraft, the obsolescent Fairey Swordfish, in the Battle of Taranto. As a result, the Italian fleet was withdrawn from Taranto and never again based in such a forward position. The Japanese used lessons from this battle in planning their attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.

====Battle of Cape Matapan====

The first fleet action of the war in the Mediterranean was the Battle of Cape Matapan. It was a decisive Allied victory, fought off the Peloponnesus coast of Greece from 27 March to 29 March 1941 in which Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy forces, under the command of the British Admiral Cunningham, intercepted those of the Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot;, under Admiral Angelo Iachino. The Allies sank the heavy cruisers &quot;Fiume&quot;, &quot;Zara&quot; and &quot;Pola&quot; and the destroyers &quot;Vittorio Alfieri&quot; and &quot;Giosue Carducci&quot;, and damaged the battleship &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;. The British lost one torpedo plane and suffered light damage to some ships.

====Yugoslavia, Greece, and Crete====

Germany launched its invasion of Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941, winning a quick victory but delaying the much larger planned invasion of Russia (Operation Barbarossa).

The Battle of Greece (also known as to the Wehrmacht as &quot;Operation Marita&quot;, or &quot;Unternehmen Marita&quot;) pitted Greek and British Commonwealth forces against German, Italian and Bulgarian forces. On 2 March 1941, the British launched Operation Lustre, the transportation of troops and equipment to Greece. Twenty-six troopships arrived at the port of Piraeus and more than 62,000 Commonwealth troops landed in Greece. The Commonwealth forces comprised the 6th Australian Division, the New Zealand 2nd Division, and the British 1st Armoured Brigade. On 3 April, during a meeting of British, Yugoslav, and Greek military representatives, the Yugoslavs promised to block the Strimon valley in case of a German attack across their territory. During this meeting, Papagos laid stress on the importance of a joint Greco-Yugoslavian offensive against the Italians as soon as the Germans launched their offensive against Yugoslavia and Greece.

In the aftermath of the German invasion of Greece, only the island of Crete remained in Allied hands in the Aegean area. The Germans invaded in a combined operation and forced the evacuation of the British forces. Of more than 40,000 Allied soldiers, fewer than 20,000 managed to escape. The evacuation was also costly to the Royal Navy. It lost 4 cruisers and 6 destroyers sunk during the evacuation. Admiral Cunningham was determined that the &quot;navy must not let the army down&quot;; when Army generals feared he would lose too many ships Cunningham remarked &quot;It takes three years to build a ship, it takes three centuries to build a tradition&quot;.

====Malta====
Malta, which lies in the middle of the Mediterranean, proved a standing thorn in the side of the Axis. It lay in a perfect strategic position to intercept Axis supplies destined for North Africa. For a time it looked as if Axis aircraft flying from bases in Italy would starve Malta into submission. The turning point in the siege of Malta came in August 1942, when the British sent a very heavily defended convoy code named Operation Pedestal. Despite the sinking of about half of the ships sent, the convoy managed to deliver enough food and aviation fuel to enable Malta to hold out until the siege was lifted. With the aid of Ultra, Malta-based aircraft and submarines sank crucial Axis shipping to North Africa immediately before the Second Battle of El Alamein of October–November 1942. Following Allied territorial gains in Libya and in the Western Mediterranean, the siege was lifted. For the fortitude and courage of the Maltese during the siege, the island was awarded the George Cross by King George VI in early 1942.

====Large-scale invasions====
In late 1942 Operation Torch, the first large Allied combined operation, was launched. The British and Americans landed in force invading French North Africa, but far enough west that the Germans were able to invade Tunisia (owned by France) and make it their base of operations.

Torch was followed by Operation Husky the invasion of Sicily, and Operation Avalanche, the invasion of southern Italy. Again the naval forces escorted the invasion fleet and heavy cover was provided against Italian interference. In the aftermath of Avalanche, the Italian surrender was announced and the British naval forces escorted the Italian fleet to Malta under the terms of the surrender. The main threat to Allied shipping around Italy during these invasions was not the Italian fleet but German guided weapons which sunk or damaged a number of Allied units.

After the surrender of the Italian fleet, naval operations in the Mediterranean became relatively mundane, consisting largely of supporting ground troops by bombardment, anti-submarine missions, covert insertions of agents on enemy coast and convoy escort.

====Aegean sweep====
The one major exception to mundane missions occurred in late 1944. Due to their garrisons on the various islands of the Aegean, the Germans had maintained control over the Aegean Sea long after they had lost other areas of the Mediterranean to Allied control. In late 1944, that changed as an Allied carrier task force moved into the area. Composed entirely of escort carriers, the task force wreaked havoc with German shipping in the area and re-asserted Allied dominance over the last remaining area of the Mediterranean still controlled by the Germans.

===Operation Overlord and the Normandy landings===

The invasion of Normandy was the greatest amphibious assault yet. Over 1,000 fighting ships and some 5,000 other ships were involved. The sheer number of vessels involved meant that nearly all of the major ports of the United Kingdom were at capacity immediately preceding the assault.

The five assault divisions crossed the channel in five great assault groups, there were two task forces, the Anglo-Canadian Eastern Task Force and the American Western Task Force. Coastal Command secured the western flank of the invasion route against interference by German U-boats from the western French ports. The surface forces assisted by protecting the assault convoys from the small German surface forces in the area. Operation Overlord saw an enormous minesweeping operation, with hundreds of minesweepers clearing and maintaining channels. The bombardment forces were on an enormous scale, with eight battleships taking part in the assault. The formidable defences of the Atlantic Wall were difficult to contend with, and many duels between the heavy ships and shore batteries were fought during the invasion.

On the whole the assault went well, although disaster came nearest to occurring for the Americans at Omaha Beach. There the naval forces provided crucial backup for the assaulting forces, with destroyers coming in very close to the beach to blast the German defences. British losses to enemy attack both during the initial assault and the building of the bridgehead were comparatively small. Virtually no ships were sunk by German naval surface forces as this force was largely destroyed prior to the invasion.

Two of the ports used by the German light forces were heavily bombed by the Allied air forces. The larger German ships based in France, three destroyers from Bordeaux were defeated in a destroyer action well to the west of the main assault area. Larger problems were caused by U-boats and especially mines, but the U-boats were hunted down and the mines swept effectively enough to make the invasion a success.

===The East===

====Indian Ocean disaster====

Though the Indian Ocean was a backwater during World War II, there were several vital operations in that area. British convoys running through the western Indian Ocean were vital for supplying Allied forces in North Africa. They faced a small but consistent threat from both German and Japanese &quot;surface raiders&quot; and submarines. Tankers sailing from the oil terminals of Iran also had to run the same gauntlet.

The major operations in the Indian Ocean took place in early 1942 and 1944/45.

British forces in the Singapore region were reinforced by the battleship HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and battlecruiser HMS &quot;Repulse&quot; in December 1941. However, on 10 December those two ships were sunk by Japanese aircraft, with HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; becoming the first battleship in history to be sunk strictly by airpower while at sea and fighting back.

Japanese forces captured Malaya (now Malaysia), Singapore and the Dutch East Indies forcing the remaining British warships to withdraw to Trincomalee, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and in February 1942, they were reconstituted into the British Eastern Fleet. On paper, the fleet looked impressive, boasting five battleships and three aircraft carriers. However, four of the battleships were old and obsolete and one of the aircraft carriers was small and virtually useless in a fleet action as the new fleet commander, Admiral James Somerville, noted.

Following successes over American forces in the Pacific, the main Japanese carrier force made its one and only foray into the Indian Ocean in April 1942. Nagumo took the main force after the British fleet and a subsidiary raid was made on shipping in the Bay of Bengal. The weight and experience of this Japanese force far outweighed that available to the Royal Navy. During these attacks, two British heavy cruisers, and , the aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Hermes&quot;, and the Australian destroyer were sunk by Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers.

Fortuitously, or by design, the main British fleet did not make contact with the Japanese and thus remained available for future action.

====Indian Ocean retreat====
Following those attacks, the British fleet retreated to Kilindini in East Africa, as their more forward fleet anchorages could not be adequately protected from Japanese attack. The fleet in the Indian Ocean was then gradually reduced to little more than a convoy escort force as other commitments called for the more powerful ships.

One exception was Operation Ironclad, a campaign launched when it was feared that Vichy French Madagascar might fall into Japanese hands, to be used as a submarine base. Such a blow would have been devastating to British lines of communication to the Far East and Middle East, but the Japanese never contemplated it. The French resisted more than expected, and more operations were needed to capture the island, but it did eventually fall.

====Indian Ocean strike====

It was only after the war in Europe was coming to an end that large British forces were dispatched to the Indian Ocean again after the neutralisation of the German fleet in late 1943 and early 1944. The success of Operation Overlord in June meant even more craft from the Home Fleet could be sent, including precious amphibious assault shipping.

During late 1944, as more British aircraft carriers came into the area, a series of strikes were flown against oil targets in Sumatra to prepare British carriers for the upcoming operations in the Pacific. For the first attack, the United States lent . The oil installations were heavily damaged by the attacks, aggravating the Japanese fuel shortages due to the Allied blockade. The final attack was flown as the carriers were heading for Sydney to become the British Pacific Fleet.

After the departure of the main battle forces, the Indian Ocean was left with escort carriers and older battleships as the mainstay of its naval forces. Nevertheless, during those months important operations were launched in the recapture of Burma, including landings on Ramree, Akyab and near Rangoon.

====Blockade of Japan====
British forces consistently played a secondary but significant role to American forces in the strangling of Japan&#x27;s trade. The earliest successes were gained by mine laying. The Japanese minesweeping capability was never great, and when confronted with new types of mines they did not adapt quickly. Japanese shipping was driven from the Burmese coast using this type of warfare.

British submarines also operated against Japanese shipping, although later in the war. They were based in Ceylon, Fremantle, Western Australia and finally the Philippines. A major success was the sinking of several Japanese cruisers.

==The North African desert, Middle East, and Africa==
On 13 September 1940, the Italian Tenth Army crossed the border from the Italian colony of Libya into Egypt, where British troops were protecting the Suez Canal. The Italian invasion carried through to Sidi Barrani, approximately 95 km inside Egypt. The Italians then began to entrench. At this time there were only 30,000 British available to defend against 250,000 Italian troops. The Italian decision to halt the advance is generally credited to them being unaware of the British strength, and the activity of British naval forces operating in the Mediterranean to interfere with Italian supply lines. There were Royal Navy seaports at Alexandria, Haifa, and Port Said. Following the halt of the Italian Tenth Army, the British used the Western Desert Force&#x27;s Jock columns to harass their lines in Egypt.

===The Offensive===
On 11 November 1940, the Royal Navy crippled or destroyed three Italian battleships in the Battle of Taranto.

Then, on 8 December 1940, Operation Compass began. Planned as an extended raid, a force of British, Indian and Australian troops succeeded in cutting off the Italian troops. Pressing their advantage home, General Richard O&#x27;Connor pressed the attack forwards and succeeded in reaching El Agheila (an advance of 500 miles), capturing tens of thousands of enemy troops. The Italian army was virtually destroyed, and it seemed that the Italians would be swept out of Libya. However, at the crucial moment, Winston Churchill ordered that the advance be stopped and troops dispatched to defend Greece. Weeks later the first German troops were arriving in North Africa to reinforce the Italians.

===Iraq, Syria and Persia===
In May 1941, to add to British troubles in the area, there was a coup d&#x27;état against the pro-British government in Iraq. A pro-German ruler took power in the coup and ordered British forces out of Iraq. There were two main British bases in Iraq, around Basra and at Habbaniya north east of Baghdad. Basra was too well defended for the Iraqis to consider taking. However, Habbaniya was a poorly defended air base, situated in the middle of enemy territory. It had no regular air forces, being only a training centre. Nonetheless, the RAF personnel at the base converted as many of the training aircraft as possible to carry weapons.

When Iraqi forces came to Habbaniya, they surrounded the base and gave warning that any military activity would be considered as hostile, leading to an attack. However, the RAF training aircraft took off and bombed the Iraqi forces, repelling them from the base. Columns were then set out from Habbaniya, Palestine and Basra to capture Baghdad, and put an end to the coup. They succeeded at relatively low cost, but there was a disturbing development during the campaign.

A Luftwaffe aircraft was shot down over Iraq during the advance on Baghdad. The nearest Axis bases were on Rhodes, and so the aircraft had to stage through somewhere to be able to get to Iraq. The only possible place was Vichy-controlled Syria. This overtly hostile action could not be tolerated. Consequently, after victory in Iraq, British forces invaded Syria and Lebanon to remove the Vichy officials from power there. Vigorous resistance was put up by the French against British and Australian forces moving into Lebanon from Palestine. However, pressure there eventually overwhelmed, and when this combined with an advance on Damascus from Iraq, the French surrendered.

The final major military operation in the war in the Middle East took place shortly thereafter. The Soviet Union desperately needed supplies for its war against Germany. Supplies were being sent around the North Cape convoy route to Murmansk and Arkhangelsk, but the capacity of that route was limited and subject to enemy action. Supplies were also sent from the United States to Vladivostok in Soviet-flagged ships. However, yet more capacity was needed, the obvious answer was to go through Persia (now Iran). The Shah of Persia was somewhat pro-German, and so would not allow this. Consequently, British and Soviet forces invaded and occupied Persia. The Shah was deposed (removed from power) and his son put on the throne.

===Ethiopia===

The Italians declared war on 10 June 1940 and in addition to the well known campaigns in the western desert, a front was opened against them in Africa. This front was in and around the Italian East African colonies: Ethiopia, Italian Somaliland, and Eritrea.

As in Egypt, British forces were massively outnumbered by their Italian opponents. However, unlike Libya, Ethiopia was isolated from the Italian mainland, and the Italians were thus cut off from resupply.

The first offensive moves of the campaign fell to the Italians. They attacked in three directions, into Sudan, Kenya and British Somaliland. Only in the Italian conquest of British Somaliland did they enjoy full success. The British garrison in Somaliland was outnumbered, and after a couple of weeks of fighting had to be evacuated to Aden. In Sudan and Kenya, the Italians conquered only some small areas around border villages.

After their offensives petered out, as in Egypt, the Italians adopted a passive attitude and waited for the inevitable British counter-attack. Attention then shifted to the naval sphere.

The Italians had a small naval squadron based at Asmara, Eritrea, called the Red Sea Flotilla. This was a threat to the British convoys heading up the Red Sea. It consisted of a few destroyers and submarines. However, the squadron was not used aggressively and mostly acted as a &quot;fleet in being&quot;. As supplies of fuel decreased, its opportunities for action also decreased. The Italians made one major attempt to attack a convoy, and they were roundly defeated in doing so. Following that attack, most of the surface ships of the squadron were sunk, and the submarines that escaped travelled around the Cape of Good Hope to return to Italy.

British forces were thin on the ground in East Africa, and the two nations that made the greatest contribution to victory on land were South Africa and India. South Africa provided much needed airpower and troops. The Indian Army made up the mainstay of the British ground forces. In the end, two Indian divisions saw combat in Ethiopia.

Another important aspect of the campaign to retake Ethiopia was irregular forces. Major Orde Wingate, later to gain fame in Burma with the Chindits was a major mover behind the Ethiopian &quot;patriots&quot; as they were referred to by the British. The irregulars, formed into the Gideon Force, disrupted Italian supply lines and provided vital intelligence to British forces.

The regular push to take Ethiopia began once reinforcements arrived from Egypt. The arrival of the first Australian division in North Africa had allowed the release of the Indian 4th Infantry Division to be sent to East Africa. Along with the Indian 5th Infantry Division, it quickly took the offensive from Sudan, the Indian divisions were supported by a thrust from Kenya. An amphibious assault on British Somaliland was staged from Aden. The three thrusts converged on the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, which fell early in May 1941.

The Italians made a final stand around the town of Amba Alagi, before they were finally defeated. Amba Alagi fell in mid-May 1941. The last significant Italian forces surrendered at Gondar in November 1941, receiving full military honors.

After December 1941, some Italians launched a limited guerrilla war in Ethiopia and Eritrea that lasted until the middle of 1943 when Italy left the war, (see Armistice with Italy).

===War in the Western Desert===

After Rommel&#x27;s first offensive, a reorganisation of British command took place. In November 1941, the British Eighth Army was activated under Lieutenant General Sir Alan Cunningham. Its first offensive failed disastrously as German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel blunted the thrust. British operational doctrine failed to encourage the effective use of tanks – a prerequisite for successful modern desert warfare. Cunningham was relieved of command and Major General Neil Ritchie was put in his place. However, a second British offensive in late 1941 turned Rommel&#x27;s flank and led to the relief of Tobruk. Again Cyrenaica fell into British hands, this time the advance went as far as El Agheila. However outside events again intervened to impede British efforts; as the British attack reached El Agheila Japan attacked in the Far East. That meant that reinforcements that had been destined for the Middle East went elsewhere. This was to have disastrous effects.

Rommel took the offensive again in January 1942. He had been instructed by his high command to only conduct a limited offensive against British positions. However, he disobeyed orders and exploited the British collapse.

An operation had been planned to take Malta, and thus reduce its strangulation of Rommel&#x27;s supply lines. However, with his new offensive, Rommel was consuming materiel meant for the Malta attack. It came down to a choice of attacking Malta or supporting Rommel; Rommel&#x27;s attack won out. At the time Malta seemed neutralised, but this mistake was to come to haunt the Axis later.

Confusion in British ranks was horrendous as attempts to shore up the position failed time and again. After the Battle of Gazala, Rommel not only drove the British out of Libya, and somewhat into Egypt, but he pushed deep into the protectorate. Tobruk fell quickly, and there was no repeat of the epic siege that Rommel&#x27;s last advance had produced. A prepared defensive line at Mersa Matruh was outflanked, and disaster beckoned. Ritchie was dismissed as Eighth Army commander and Claude Auchinleck, the Commander-in-Chief Middle East Command, came forward to take command of it himself. After Matruh there was only one more defensive position before Cairo itself; El Alamein.

Auchinlek managed to stop Rommel with the First Battle of El Alamein.

A new command team arrived in the Middle East, with Lieutenant General Sir Bernard Montgomery assuming command of the Eighth Army. Rommel tried to break through again during the Battle of Alam Halfa, but his thrust was stopped. Montgomery then began preparations for a great breakthrough offensive that would result in the pursuit of Axis forces all the way to Tunisia.

===Operation Torch and El Alamein===

8 November 1942 saw the first great amphibious assault of World War II. In Operation Torch, an Anglo-American force landed on the shores of Algeria and Morocco. However, even in Algeria, despite having a large British content, the allies maintained the illusion that this was an American operation in order to reduce possible resistance by the French.

After the attack by Force H on the French fleet at Mers el Kebir in 1940, anti-British feeling ran high among the French. This had been exacerbated by later British operations against Vichy-controlled territories at Dakar, Syria and Lebanon, and the invasion of Madagascar. It was feared that any British attack on French soil would lead to prolonged resistance. Ironically, the attack which saw the greatest resistance was that wholly American landing in Morocco. A full scale naval battle was fought between French and American ships, and ground fighting was also heavy.

The resistance did not last long. The French surrendered and then shortly afterward joined the Allied cause. One of the main reasons for the quick switch of sides was because the Germans had moved into unoccupied France, ending the Vichy regime, shortly after the North African garrisons had surrendered.

Once resistance in Algeria and Morocco was over, the campaign became a race. The Germans were pouring men and supplies into Tunisia, and the Allies were trying to get sufficient troops into the country quickly enough to stop them before the need for a full-scale campaign to drive them out occurred.

Just before Operation Torch, the Second Battle of El Alamein was being fought in Egypt. The new commander of the Eighth Army, Lieutenant General Sir Bernard Montgomery, had the opportunity to conclusively defeat the Panzerarmee Afrika under Erwin Rommel, since Rommel was at the end of enormously stretched supply lines, the British were close to their supply bases, and Rommel was about to be attacked from the rear by Torch.

The Second Battle of El Alamein saw enormous use made of artillery. Rommel&#x27;s forces had laid large numbers of mines in the desert, and the terrain of the area prevented his position being outflanked, and British naval forces were not powerful enough to land a significant force directly behind Rommel to cut his supply lines directly at the same time as Operation Torch. Consequently, the German lines had to be attacked directly. However, that did not mean that Montgomery did not try to use feint and deception in the battle. &quot;Dummy tanks&quot; and other deceptions were used liberally to try to fool the Germans where the stroke would fall.

The main attack went in, but it was turned back by the extensive minefields. Montgomery then shifted the axis of advance to another point to throw the Germans off balance. What had formerly been a spoiling attack was developed into the new major thrust. Through a grinding battle of attrition, the Germans were thrown back.
After El Alamein, Rommel&#x27;s forces were pursued through the western desert for the last time. Cyrenaica was retaken from Axis forces, and then Tripolitania was won for the first time. Rommel&#x27;s forces, apart from small rearguard actions to hold up Montgomery&#x27;s men, did not turn and fight again until they were within the Mareth Line defences of southern Tunisia.

===Battle for Tunisia===

As British forces swept west through Libya and Anglo-American forces closed in from Algeria, the Axis began to pour reinforcements into Tunisia. A new command under Colonel General Jurgen von Arnim was set up, von Arnim was a confirmed enemy of Rommel, and so German command relations did not get off to a good start.

Rommel turned to face Montgomery&#x27;s forces who had caught up with the Panzerarmee Afrika at last at the Mareth Line. The Mareth Line was a series of old French border defences against Italian forces from Libya. Rommel took them over and improved them greatly. It took a major effort for British forces to break through. However, by this time Rommel had left Africa, never to return.

It was decided that First Army should make the main thrust to destroy Axis formations in Africa. II Corps was moved from the south to north of the front, and the French XIX Corps took up station on the right wing of the First Army. The Eighth Army was to make a subsidiary thrust along the coast to pin down Axis forces.

The final offensive began at the end of March 1943, and by May, Axis forces had surrendered. 250,000 men were taken prisoner, a number comparable to the battle of Stalingrad.

==The Italian campaign==

The Italian Campaign was the name of Allied operations in and around Italy, from 1943 to the end of the war. Joint Allied Forces Headquarters AFHQ was operationally responsible for all Allied land forces in the Mediterranean theatre, and it planned and commanded the invasion of Sicily and the campaign on the Italian mainland until the surrender of German forces in Italy in May 1945.

===Invasion of Sicily===
On 10 July 1943, Sicily was invaded. The operation, named Operation Husky, was directed from Malta. British forces attacked on the eastern flank of the landing, with the British Eighth Army&#x27;s XXX Corps coming ashore at Cape Passero and XIII Corps at Syracuse. The Eighth Army&#x27;s job was to advance up the east coast of Sicily. Originally British forces were to have the main role in the attack on the island but, when their advance slowed, the American Seventh Army on the west side of the island swept around the enemy flank instead. The local Sicilians were also reported to have greatly supported the advancing Americans to defeat the fascists.

The Eighth Army eventually battered its way past the German defences and enveloped Mount Etna; by this time the Germans and Italians were retreating. By 17 August all the Axis forces had evacuated the island, and Messina was captured that day.

===Surrender of Italy===
After operations in Sicily, the Italian Government was teetering on the brink of collapse. Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was ousted by the Grand Council of Fascism and, on orders of King Victor Emmanuel, Mussolini was taken into custody. Peace feelers were put out to the Allies. However, the invasion of Italy still proceeded.

On 3 September 1943, the first attacks were made directly across the Straits of Messina by Eighth Army in Operation Baytown. V and XIII Corps carried out that attack. Montgomery&#x27;s forces leap-frogged up the toe of Italy over the next few days. A subsidiary landing, Operation Slapstick, was also made on 9 September at the Italian naval base of Taranto by the 1st Airborne Division.

Also on 3 September, King Victor Emmanuel and Marshal Pietro Badoglio secretly signed an armistice with the Allies. On 8 September, the armistice was made public and a government was set up in southern Italy. What was known as the &quot;Badoglio Government&quot; joined the Allies against the Axis.

The main attack, Operation Avalanche, was delivered on 9 September at Salerno. Salerno was chosen for the site of the attack because it was the furthest north that the single-engined fighters based in Sicily could realistically provide cover. Escort carriers also stood off shore to supplement the cover given by land-based aircraft. A subsidiary landing, Operation Slapstick, was also made on the same day at the Italian naval base of Taranto by the British 1st Airborne Division, landed directly into the port from warships. News of the Italian surrender was broadcast as the troop convoys were converging on Salerno.

The Germans reacted extremely quickly to the Italian surrender. They disarmed the Italian troops near their forces and took up defensive positions near Salerno. Italian troops were disarmed throughout Italy and Italian-controlled areas in what was known as Operation Axis (&quot;Operation Achse&quot;).

The landings at Salerno were made by the U.S. Fifth Army under Lieutenant General Mark Clark. It consisted of the U.S. VI Corps landing on the right flank and the British X Corps landing on the left. Initial resistance was heavy, however heavy naval and air support combined with the approach of Eighth Army from the south eventually forced the Germans to withdraw. By 25 September a line from Naples to Bari was controlled by Allied forces.

Further relatively rapid advances continued over the next few weeks, but by the end of October, the front was stalled. The Germans had taken up extremely powerful defensive positions on the Winter Line. There the front would remain for the next six months.

About two months after his ouster, Mussolini was rescued by the Germans in Operation Oak (&quot;Unternehmen Eiche&quot;). He set up the Italian Social Republic in northern Italy.

===The Winter Line, Anzio and the Battle of Monte Cassino===

The linchpin of the Winter Line position was the town and monastery of Monte Cassino. The extremely powerful position dominated a key route to Rome and thus it had to be captured. British forces (the 46th and 56th divisions) on the left flank of Fifth Army tried to cross the Garigliano River and were also driven back, as was a joint French-American attempt.

With no sign of a breakthrough it was decided to attempt to outflank the Winter Line with an amphibious landing behind it. Operation Shingle involved landings at Anzio on the West coast on 23 January 1944. The assaulting formations were controlled by the U.S. VI Corps, but as with Salerno, there was a substantial British component to the assault force. The British 1st Infantry Division and 2nd Commando Brigade formed the left flank of the assault.

Again, like Salerno, there were serious problems with the landings. The commander, Lieutenant General John P. Lucas, did not exploit as aggressively as he might have done and was relieved for it. Lucas believed that if he had pushed too far, his forces could have been cut off by the Germans, but the whole purpose of the invasion was to attack the German lines behind Monte Cassino and break out into the Italian areas which were undefended. The Germans came even closer than Salerno to breaking up the beachhead. They pushed through the defences to the last line before the sea. Again massive firepower on the Allied side saved the beachhead.

After the initial attack and after the German counter-attack had been repulsed, the Anzio beachhead settled down to stalemate. The attempt at outflanking the Winter Line had failed. It was May before a breakout from the beachhead could be attempted.

===Breakthrough to Rome===
By May 1944, U.S. VI Corps had been reinforced to a strength of seven divisions. In the Fourth Battle of Monte Cassino (also known as Operation Diadem), a concerted attack was made at both Anzio and the Winter Line. The German defences finally cracked.

The front had been reorganised. V Corps was left on the Adriatic, but the rest of Eighth Army was moved over the Apennines to concentrate more forces to take Rome. The front of Fifth Army was thus considerably reduced. X Corps also moved to Eighth Army as the complicated arrangement of British forces under American command was removed. Several battles for Cassino followed, contested by Indian, New Zealand and Polish forces. In the end, Cassino lost its pivotal position as operations elsewhere on the front managed to turn its flanks. These included a brilliant demonstration of mountain warfare by the French Expeditionary Corps.

British forces were not well handled during Diadem. Oliver Leese, the commander of Eighth Army, made an enormous mistake by sending the heavily mechanised XIII Corps up the Liri Valley towards Rome. An enormous traffic jam developed. There was also controversy over the handling of American forces. VI Corps had originally been supposed to interpose itself on the route to Rome and cut off the German forces retreating from the Winter Line. However, Clark decided instead to advance on Rome, and ordered only a comparatively token force into a blocking position and ordered the rest of the Corps to head for Rome. The Germans brushed aside the blocking force and thus a major part of their formations escaped encirclement. A total of 25 divisions (roughly a tenth of the Wehrmacht) escaped, and this led to the war in Italy dragging on until 1945. Speculation surrounds this whole episode and many in the Allied command felt that Mark Clark had disobeyed direct orders for his own glory and contributed to the war&#x27;s extension. If he had cut off those forces as had been planned and ordered, they could have been destroyed in the same way as was achieved in France, and the German resistance in Italy would have collapsed. The Allies could have advanced up the spine of Italy and invaded Austria and southern Germany. This was the plan of the British, one not supported by the Americans, and as such Mark Clark&#x27;s actions may have been politically motivated, or driven by Washington. It is true that Mark Clark was not punished for his change of route, even though other commanders were for less.

Rome fell on 5 June, and the pursuit continued well beyond the city, into northern Italy.

===The Gothic Line and victory in Italy===
By the end of August 1944, Allied forces had reached Pisa and Pesaro on each coast. As with the previous year, the advance then slowed greatly. The composition of the forces in Italy had changed again with the withdrawal of the French forces for the invasion of southern France, Operation Dragoon. The U.S. IV Corps had been activated to replace the French in Fifth Army. Eighth Army was composed of V, X and XIII Corps of the British forces, Canadian I Corps and Polish II Corps. However, during this period, XIII Corps was temporarily placed under the command of the U.S. Fifth Army.

Between August and December, the Eighth Army slowly progressed up the east coast. The Polish II Corps captured the important port-city of Ancona, thus significantly shortening the allied supply line. The original aim had been to break through in the Po plain by the end of 1944, but that was nowhere near possible. December saw the line just south of Lake Comacchio, with the Germans holding a salient to the west. Fifth Army was in the high passes of the Apennines.

After December, operations ground to a halt for the winter. The only major event that took place during this period was the removal of I Canadian Corps from the Italian front to reinforce Canadian 1st Army in France. The offensive was not renewed until April. The choice for the last offensive was whether the major blow should fall on the Fifth Army or the Eighth Army front. Eventually, it was settled that Eighth Army should make the major attack. A deception plan was hatched to convince the Germans that Fifth Army would launch the major attack, and a major logistical effort was required to move formations to their start lines.

On 2 April 1945, the attack was launched and the advance was again slow at first.

By 20 April, Bologna was in a salient held by the Germans, and Lake Comacchio was crossed by an amphibious attack. The Germans were close to breaking. In the next ten days, the German forces were either surrounded or pinned against the River Po. The Germans were reduced in large part to scattered bands and bereft of heavy equipment.

On 28 April, Mussolini and a group of fascist Italians were captured by Italian partisans while attempting to flee Italy. Mussolini and about fifteen other fascists were executed and their bodies taken to Milan for display.

On 29 April, Marshal Rodolfo Graziani surrendered the Italian LXXXXVII Army (&quot;Liguria&quot;), the army of Mussolini&#x27;s Italian Social Republic.

The progress in May was rapid. The American forces mopped up in the upper Po Valley and captured Genoa, the Polish forces captured Bologna, and the British forces cleared the lower Po and reached the Yugoslav and Austrian borders.

On 2 May, the German forces in Italy capitulated. This occurred shortly before the main German surrender on 8 May.

==The liberation of Europe==

===Operation Overlord===

The invasion of Normandy, the largest amphibious assault in history, took place on 6 June 1944. All ground armies, US and British, were under the command of British General Montgomery. The operation involved the landing of five assault divisions from the sea and three assault divisions by parachute and glider. Of those, one airborne and two seaborne divisions were British. The British airborne formation involved was 6th Airborne Division, with the British seaborne divisions being the 3rd Infantry Division landing at Sword Beach and 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division and 8th Armoured Brigade on Gold Beach. No.48 Commando landed with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division at Juno; the remaining divisions were provided by the United States.

The British formations were assigned to the eastern end of the beachhead. The 6th Airborne Division landed to secure the eastern flank of the assault forces. The first Allied units in action were the glider-borne troops that assaulted Pegasus Bridge. Beyond the main formations, various smaller units went ashore. Prominent among those were the British Commandos.

The United Kingdom was the main base for the operation and provided the majority of the naval power. Nearly eighty per cent of the bombarding and transporting warships were from the Royal Navy. Airpower for the operation was a more even divide. The United States contributed two air forces to the battle, the Eighth Air Force with strategic bombers, and the Ninth Air Force for tactical airpower. All the home commands of the RAF were involved in the operation. Coastal Command secured the English Channel against German naval vessels. Bomber Command had been engaged in reducing communications targets in France for several months to paralyse the movement of German reinforcements to the battle. It also directly supported the bombardment forces on the morning of the assault. Air Defence of the United Kingdom, the temporarily renamed Fighter Command, provided air superiority over the beachhead. The 2nd Tactical Air Force provided direct support to the Empire formations.

The operation was a success. Both tactical and strategic surprise were achieved.

Most of the initial objectives for the day were not achieved, but a firm beachhead was established. It was gradually built up until offensive operations could begin in earnest. The first major success was the capture of Cherbourg.

In the east, the first major British objective was Caen, an extremely tough nut to crack. The battle for the city turned into a long drawn-out battle. It eventually fell in July.

====Controversies====
After the war Montgomery claimed that the battle for Normandy progressed largely as he had planned the operation at St. Paul&#x27;s school in Fulham, London, supported by American generals, General Eisenhower, General Bradley and Australian war correspondent Chester Wilmott, amongst others. Eisenhower stated three years after the war in his memoirs, Crusade in Europe, that the plan &quot;was never abandoned, even momentarily, throughout the campaign&quot;. The basic plan was for the British to draw in, hold, and destroy German armor in the east, not acquiring territory, while the US forces in the lightly defended territory to the west built up their strength and break out in Operation Cobra.

Montgomery did not overly publicise some of the points of the plan for fear of lowering the morale of British troops, who would take on the brunt of the experienced German armored forces to allow American troops to break out. Montgomery understood that high morale facilitated superior battlefield performance, especially in non-regular soldiers. The mix of forces in the British and Canadian ranks indicated this with great emphasis on tanks and vehicles. Prime minister Churchill asked why there was so many vehicles in relation to infantry troops in the British armies, as vehicles required a larger logistical backup, which diverts men away from fighting duties. Montgomery told Churchill every vehicle is needed and that he would not allow him to interrogate his staff on the matter, otherwise he would resign. Churchill wept and left the room. Montgomery claimed that Eisenhower, although giving approval, did not fully understand the plan in detail as laid down in St. Paul&#x27;s School. General Bradley fully understood and confirmed Montgomery&#x27;s original plan and intentions, writing:
:&quot;The British and Canadian armies were to decoy the enemy reserves and draw them to their front on the extreme eastern edge of the Allied beachhead. Thus, while Monty taunted the enemy at Caen, we [the Americans] were to make our break on the long roundabout road to Paris. When reckoned in terms of national pride, this British decoy mission became a sacrificial one, for while we tramped around the outside flank, the British were to sit in place and pin down the Germans. Yet strategically it fitted into a logical division of labors, for it was towards Caen that the enemy reserves would race once the alarm was sounded&quot;.
Post war a number of Americans authors argued that Montgomery&#x27;s generalship was flawed and that the battle had to be fought differently from planned because Montgomery promised more than he could deliver.
This was mainly based on that the British forces did not aggressively pursue territory. Author and military officer Stephen Hart analysed the 21st Army Group in 1992 and finds that Montgomery&#x27;s emphasis on the reduction of casualties which would maintain morale and a higher fighting performance in non-regular soldiers, which most soldiers were, were the primary influences on his operational conduct. Hart concludes that Montgomery was the most competent British general in Europe for he understood Britain&#x27;s war aims. His concern with his units&#x27; morale was legitimate, recognizing that the British had an infantry manpower problem as emphasis was on armoured vehicles to counter superior German armour. Both factors influenced his handling of the 21st Army Group. Hart destroys the myth that Montgomery was unnecessarily cautious.

===Breakout from Normandy===

The British and Canadian forces largely destroyed German armour in the east of Normandy allowing the American forces to break out in late July 1944 in Operation Cobra. Allied forces began an envelopment of the German forces remaining in Normandy. Hitler ordered a counter-attack on the seemingly vulnerable strip of territory that the US forces controlled on the Normandy coast, linking the First and Third Armies.

As American forces swept round to the south, British, Canadian and Polish forces pinned and then pushed the Germans from the north. A German pocket formed to the south of the town of Falaise when the two allied forces met. Up to 150,000 German soldiers were trapped and around 60,000 casualties were inflicted.

As arranged before the Normandy invasion, General Eisenhower took over as Ground Forces Command from Montgomery on 1 September, while Montgomery continued to command the British 21st Army Group, now consisting mainly of British and Canadian units.

Following the Normandy battle there was little German resistance left in the west. British forces swept north entering Belgium on 2 September 1944, while American forces swept east. Paris fell at the end of August 1944 to brigadier general Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s Free French troops and American forces. By the end of September much of France had been liberated.

Logistical difficulties then caught up with the Allies as all supplies had to be transported from Normandy. Because of thinly-stretched supply lines, the American fast broad-front advance could not be sustained, grinding to a halt in Lorraine and Belgium. Heated discussions then took place over the next phase of Allied strategy.

===Riviera invasion===
Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France in August 1944 was carried out almost entirely by American and Free French troops, though British naval forces took part in bombardment duties and air protection of the beachhead. The only British land forces to take part were the 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade. They landed without much opposition, and rapidly took their objectives. The quick success of the operation allowed them to be withdrawn from the line and redeployed to Greece where they were urgently needed to help quell the civil war.

===Operation Market Garden===
Montgomery and Eisenhower had long been debating the merits of a broad front attack strategy versus concentrating power in one area and punching through German lines. Eisenhower favoured the former, and Montgomery the latter. However, in late 1944, logistic problems meant that the former was temporarily out of the question. Montgomery conceived Operation Market Garden to implement a narrow front strategy. The idea was to land airborne forces in the Netherlands to take vital bridges over the country&#x27;s various rivers. Armoured formation would then relieve the airborne forces and advance quickly into Germany.

American paratroops were dropped at intermediate points north of Allied lines, with the British 1st Airborne Division and Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade at the tip of the salient at Arnhem. All the bridges were captured on the 1st day except the Nijmegen bridge, which caused a near two day delay, the plan then began to run into serious trouble. The relief forces of Lieutenant General Horrock&#x27;s XXX Corps had to advance up a single good road. Being unable to progress past Nijmegen, congestion along the road emerged. The Germans reacted quickly to attack the road from both sides. Consequently, XXX Corps had to seize the bridge which the US 82nd paratroopers failed to do, which took a great deal longer than expected to progress through to Arnhem. By the time XXX Corps reached Arnhem the British 1st Airborne had capitulated on the bridge.

The 1st Airborne Division held the Arnhem bridge for four days, and had a large force over the river for a total of nine days, before finally withdrawing in a daring night escape back over the Rhine. Of the more than 10,000 men who flew into the Arnhem operation, only about 2,000 returned. 1st Airborne Division was essentially finished as a fighting formation for the duration of the war without having achieved the original objective.

In the aftermath of the attack, the salient&#x27;s flanks were expanded to complete the closing up to the Rhine in that section of the front.

===Walcheren===
Following Market Garden, the great port of Antwerp had been captured. However, it lay at the end of a long river estuary, and so it could not be used until its approaches were clear. The southern bank of the Scheldt was cleared by Canadian and Polish forces relatively quickly, but the thorny problem of the island of Walcheren remained.

Walcheren guarded the northern approaches to Antwerp and thus had to be stormed. The dikes and dunes were bombed at three locations, Westkapelle, Veere and Flushing, in order to inundate the island. In the last great amphibious operation of the war in Europe, British Commandos and Canadian troops captured the island in the late autumn of 1944, clearing the way for Antwerp to be opened and for the easement of the critical logistical problems the Allies were suffering.

===Battle of the Bulge===
After December 1944, the strategy was to complete the conquest of the Rhineland and prepare to break into Germany proper en masse. However, what happened next completely caught the Allied staffs by surprise.

The Germans launched their last great offensive in December, resulting in the Battle of the Bulge. In an attempt to repeat their 1940 success, German forces were launched through the Ardennes. Again they encountered weak forces holding the front, as the American formations there were either new to the war or exhausted units on a quiet sector of the front rehabilitating. There were however also some important differences to 1940 which resulted in the German offensive ultimately failing. They were facing enormously strong Allied airpower unlike in 1940 when they had ruled the skies. The opening of the offensive was timed for a spell of bad weather, aimed at removing the threat of the Allied airpower, but the weather cleared again relatively soon.

Most of the forces that took part in the Battle of the Bulge were American. Some great feats of staff work resulted in the Third Army and Ninth Army, essentially altering their facing by ninety degrees to contain the salient. However, the salient created by the German attack meant that First and Ninth Armies were cut off from 12th Army Group Headquarters, so they were shifted to the command of 21st Army Group for the duration of the battle meaning the British army group had an important controlling role. The British XXX Corps also took part in the battle in a backstop role to contain any further German advances.

By the end of January, the salient had effectively been reduced back to its former size, and the temporarily aborted mission of liberating the Rhineland recommenced. First Army returned to 12th Army Group, but Ninth Army remained under the control of 21st Army Group for the time being.

===Crossing the Rhine and final surrender===
The penultimate preliminary operation to close up to the Rhine in the British section was the clearing of the Roer Triangle (codename Operation Blackcock). The XIII Corps removed German forces from the west bank of the Roer during the second half of January 1945.

Following the reaching of the Roer, Second Army shifted to the mission of pinning German forces opposing it. Ninth Army in Operation Grenade and First Army in Operation Veritable began a great pincer movement to destroy the remaining German forces west of the Rhine. The only British forces to take part in the main part of this offensive was XXX Corps, which was part of First Army.

By 5 March 1945, British Empire and American forces had closed up to the Rhine in all but a small salient on their sectors of the front. That salient was reduced by five days later.

On 23 March, the operations to cross the Rhine in the north began. The British Second and U.S. Ninth Armies took the lead. Ninth Army, on the south flank, took part in the great encirclement of German forces in the Ruhr. The U.S. First Army on the right crossed the Rhine in early April and then swung left to liberate the north of the Netherlands. Second Army drove straight across the North German plain, reaching the Ems on 1 April and the Weser on 4 April. After the closing of the Ruhr pocket on that day, Ninth Army reverted to the command of 12th Army Group.
On 15 April the British troops liberated Bergen-Belsen.

By 18 April, First Army had reached the coast in much of the Netherlands, isolating the German forces there. Second Army reached the Elbe the next day. The only moves in the Netherlands that the Canadian and Polish forces made for the remainder of the war were reducing a small amount of the coast of the IJsselmeer that had not been captured and liberating a small amount of territory around Groningen. Most of German Frisia also fell to Canadian and Polish forces. British units reached the Baltic on 2 May, and then halted as they had reached the agreed line of meeting Soviet forces. The war came to an end on 7 May, and British forces reoriented to the task of occupying Germany itself.

==The Far East==
On 7/8 December 1941, the Empire of Japan invaded Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaya from bases located in China and French Indochina. Although Japan declared war on the United States and the British Empire, the declaration was not delivered until after the attacks began. The United Kingdom declared war on Japan the same day. Action in this theatre ended when Japan announced an intent to surrender on 15 August 1945. The formal surrender of Japan ceremony took place on 2 September 1945.

===Disaster in Malaya and Singapore===
The outbreak of war in the Far East found the United Kingdom critically overstretched. British forces in the area were weak in almost all arms. On 8 December 1941, the Japanese launched invasions of Thailand, Malaya and Hong Kong.

On 10 December 1941, the first major setback to British power in the region was the sinking of HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and HMS &quot;Repulse&quot; by Japanese land-based planes. The sinking of these ships was triply significant. It represented the loss of the last Allied capital ships in the Pacific left after the Pearl Harbor disaster. The &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and the &quot;Repulse&quot; were the only Allied modern or &#x27;fast&#x27; battleships to be sunk in the entire war. It was the first time that a battleship had been sunk by enemy aircraft while underway at sea.

Reverses in the air and on the ground soon followed. Japanese forces had naval superiority, and they used it to make outflanking amphibious landings as they advanced down the Malayan peninsula towards Singapore. Japanese assaults from the ground and air soon made the forward landing grounds that much of the RAF&#x27;s only real hope of defending Singapore from the air rested upon untenable. The RAF took a toll of Japanese forces, but there were never enough aircraft to do anything more than delay the Japanese offensive. Indian, British, and Australian army forces in Malaya were larger in numbers than the other services. But they were equally ill-prepared and ill-led. They were committed in numbers both too small and too poorly positioned to counter the Japanese tactic of outflanking strongpoints through the jungle. Over a period of several weeks, the Allied ground forces steadily gave ground.

In early 1942, Singapore was critically unprepared for the assault that came. It had been neglected during the famine years for defence of the 1930s. It had then suffered during the war as British efforts were focused on defeating Germany and Italy. The colony was run by a Governor who did not want to &quot;upset&quot; the civilian population. Military neglect was exacerbated when he refused to allow defensive preparations before the Japanese arrived.

Following Japanese landings on Singapore, intense fighting occurred over several days. But the poorly led and increasingly disorganised Allied forces were steadily driven into a small pocket on the island.

On 15 February 1942, General Arthur Percival surrendered the 80,000 strong garrison of Singapore. This was the largest surrender of personnel under British leadership in history. Many of the troops saw little or no action. The civilian population then suffered a brutal Japanese occupation. Some aircraft escaped to Sumatra and Java, but those islands also fell to the Japanese within a short time. British forces were forced back to India and Ceylon.

===Burma Campaign===
The Burma Campaign pitted forces from the British Commonwealth, China, and United States forces against the forces of the Empire of Japan, Thailand and the Indian National Army.

In Burma, Commonwealth ground forces came primarily from the United Kingdom, British India (which included present-day Pakistan and Bangladesh), East Africa, West Africa and Nepal (Gurkhas). The British Commonwealth air and naval units and personnel deployed were primarily from the UK, India, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada.

====Forced out of Burma====
In Burma, the Japanese attacked in January, 1942 – shortly after the outbreak of war. However, they did not begin to make real progress until the fall of Malaya (31 January 1942) and of Singapore (February, 1942). After that, Tokyo could transfer large numbers of aircraft to the Burma front to overwhelm the Allied forces.

The first Japanese attacks were aimed at taking Rangoon, the major port in Burma, which offered the Allies many advantages of supply. It had at first been defended relatively successfully, with the weak RAF forces reinforced by a squadron of the famous American Volunteer Group, better known as the Flying Tigers. However, as the Japanese attack developed, the amount of warning the Rangoon airfields could get of attack decreased, and thus they became increasingly untenable.

By the start of March, Japanese forces had cut the British forces in two. Rangoon was evacuated and the port demolished. Its garrison then broke through the Japanese lines thanks to an error on the part of the Japanese commander. The British commander in Burma, Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Hutton was removed from command shortly before Rangoon fell. He was replaced by Sir Harold Alexander.

With the fall of Rangoon, a British evacuation of Burma became inevitable. Supplies could not be moved to maintain fighting forces in Burma on a large scale, since the ground communications were dreadful, sea communications risky in the extreme (along with the fact that there was only one other port of any size in Burma besides Rangoon) and air communications out of the question due to lack of transport aircraft.

Besides the Japanese superiority in training and experience, command problems beset the Burma campaign. The 1st Burma Division and Indian 17th Infantry Division at first had to be controlled directly by the Burma Army headquarters under Hutton. Burma was also swapped from command to command during the early months of the war. It had been the responsibility of GHQ India since 1937, but in the early weeks of the war, it was transferred from India to the ill-fated ABDA Command (ABDACOM). ABDA was based in Java, and it was simply impossible for Wavell, the Supreme Commander of ABDA, to keep in touch with the situation in Burma without neglecting his other responsibilities. Shortly before ABDA was dissolved, responsibility for Burma was transferred back to India. Interactions with the Chinese proved problematic. Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of Nationalist China, was a poor strategist, and the Chinese Army suffered from severe command problems, with orders having to come directly from Chiang himself if they were to be obeyed. The ability of many Chinese commanders was called into question. Finally, the Chinese Army was lacking in the ancillary services which allow a force to fight a modern war.

The problems with the Chinese were never satisfactorily resolved. However, after the dissolution of ABDA, India retained control of operations in Burma until the formation of South East Asia Command in late 1943. The problems of a lack of corps headquarters were also solved. A skeleton force known as Burcorps was formed under Lieutenant General Sir William Slim, later to gain fame as the commander of the Fourteenth Army.

Burcorps retreated almost constantly, and suffered several disastrous losses, but it eventually managed to reach India in May 1942, just before the monsoon broke. Had it still been in Burma after the monsoon broke, it would have been cut off, and likely destroyed by the Japanese. The divisions making up Burcorps were withdrawn from the line for long refit periods.

====Forgotten army====

Operations in Burma over the remainder of 1942 and in 1943 were a study of military frustration. The United Kingdom could only just maintain three active campaigns, and immediate offensives in both the Middle East and Far East proved impossible due to lack of resources. The Middle East won out, being closer to home and a campaign against the far more dangerous Germans.

During the 1942–1943 dry season, two operations were mounted. The first was a small scale offensive into the Arakan region of Burma. The Arakan is a coastal strip along the Bay of Bengal, crossed by numerous rivers. The First Arakan offensive largely failed due to difficulties of logistics, communications and command. The Japanese troops were also still assigned almost superhuman powers by their opponents. The second attack was much more controversial; that of the 77th Indian Infantry Brigade, better known as the Chindits.

Under the command of Major General Orde Wingate, the Chindits in 1944 penetrated deep behind enemy lines in an attempt to gain intelligence, break communications and cause confusion. The operation had originally been conceived as part of a much larger offensive, which had to be aborted due to lack of supplies and shipping. Almost all of the original reasons for mounting the Chindit operation were then invalid. Nevertheless, it was mounted anyway.

Some 3,000 men entered Burma in many columns. They caused damage to Japanese communications, and they gathered intelligence. However, they suffered dreadful casualties, with only two thirds of the men who set out on the expedition returning. Those that returned were wracked with disease and quite often in dreadful physical condition. The most important contributions of the Chindits to the war were unexpected. They had had to be supplied by air. At first it had been thought impossible to drop supplies over the jungle. Emergency situations that arose during the operation necessitated supply drops in the jungle, proving it was possible. It is also alleged by some that the Japanese in Burma decided to take the offensive, rather than adopt a purely defensive stance, as a direct result of the Chindit operation. Whatever the reason for this later change to the offensive, it was to prove fatal for the Japanese in Burma.

====Kohima and Imphal====

As the 1943–44 dry period dawned, both sides were preparing to take the offensive. The British Fourteenth Army struck first, but only marginally before the Japanese.

In Arakan, a British advance began on the XV Corps front. However, a Japanese counter-attack halted the advance and threatened to destroy the forces making it. Unlike during previous operations, the British forces stood firm, and were supplied from the air. The resulting Battle of Ngakyedauk Pass saw a heavy defeat handed to the Japanese. With the possibility of aerial supply, their infiltration tactics, relying on units carrying their own supplies and hoping to capture enemy victuals were fatally compromised.

On the central front, IV Corps advanced into Burma, before indications that a major Japanese offensive was building caused it to retreat on Kohima and Imphal. Forward elements of the corps were nearly cut off by Japanese forces, but eventually made it back to India. As they waited for the storm to break, the British forces were not to know that the successful defence of the two cities would be the turning point of the entire campaign in south East Asia. HQ XXXIII Corps was rushed forward to help control matters at the front and the two corps settled down for a long siege.

The Japanese threw themselves repeatedly against the defences of the two strong points, in the battles of Imphal and Kohima, but could not break through. At times the supply situation was perilous, but never totally critical. It came down to a battle of attrition, and the British forces could simply afford to fight that kind of battle for longer. In the end, the Japanese ran out of supplies, and suffered large casualties. They broke and fled back into Burma, pursued by elements of Fourteenth Army.

====Burma retaken====

The recapture of Burma took place during late 1944 and the first half of 1945. Command of the British formations on the front was rearranged in November 1944. 11th Army Group was replaced with Allied Land Forces South East Asia and XV Corps was placed directly under ALFSEA.

Some of the first operations to recapture Burma took place in Arakan. To gain bases for the aircraft necessary to supply Fourteenth Army in its attack through the heart of the country, two offshore islands, Akyab and Ramree, had to be captured. Akyab was virtually undefended when British forces came ashore, so it effectively provided a rehearsal of amphibious assault doctrine for the forces in theatre. However, Ramree was defended by several thousand Japanese. The clearing of the island took several days, and associated forces on the mainland longer to clear out. Following these actions, XV Corps was greatly reduced in numbers to free up transport aircraft to support Fourteenth Army.

Fourteenth Army made the main thrust to destroy Japanese forces in Burma. The Army had IV and XXXIII Corps under its command. The plan envisaged that XXXIII Corps would reduce Mandalay and act as a diversion for the main striking force of IV Corps, which would take Meiktila and thus cut the Japanese communications. The plan succeeded extremely well, and Japanese forces in Upper Burma were effectively reduced to scattered and unorganised pockets. Slim&#x27;s men then advanced south towards the Burmese capital.

Following the taking of Rangoon in May 1945 some Japanese forces remained in Burma, but it was effectively a large mopping up operation.
==== Malaya ====
The next major campaign was planned to be the liberation of Malaya. This was to involve an amphibious assault on the western side of Malaya codenamed Operation Zipper. The dropping of the atomic bombs in August 1945 forestalled Zipper, though some of its landings took place after the Japanese capitulation of 15 August 1945 as the quickest way of getting occupation troops into Malaya. Under Operation Jurist, Penang was retaken on 2 September 1945, while the Japanese garrison in Singapore formally surrendered on 12 September under Operation Tiderace. The rest of Malaya was liberated over the following weeks.

===Okinawa and Japan===

In their final actions of the war, substantial British naval forces took part in the Battle of Okinawa (also known as Operation Iceberg) and the final naval strikes on Japan. The British Pacific Fleet operated as a separate unit from the American task forces in the Okinawa operation. Its job was to strike airfields on the chain of islands between Formosa and Okinawa, to prevent the Japanese reinforcing the defences of Okinawa from that direction. British forces made a significant contribution to the success of the invasion.

During the final strikes against Japan, British forces operated as an integral part of the American task force.

Only a small British naval force was present for Japan&#x27;s surrender. Most British forces had been withdrawing to base to prepare for Operation Coronet, the second part of the massive invasion of Japan.

==The air war==
===Battle of Britain: 1940===

The &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; in the autumn of 1940 involved German plans for an invasion called &quot;Operation Sea Lion&quot;. First the Luftwaffe began operations to destroy the Royal Air Force (RAF). At first the Germans focused on RAF airfields and radar stations. However, when the RAF bomber forces (quite separate from the fighter forces) attacked Berlin, Hitler swore revenge and diverted the Luftwaffe to attacks on London. Using the Luftwaffe&#x27;s limited resources to attack civilians instead of airfields and radar proved a major mistake. The success the Luftwaffe was having in rapidly wearing down the RAF was squandered, as the civilians being hit were far less critical than the airfields and radar stations that were now ignored. London was not a factory city and British aircraft production was not impeded; indeed it went up. The last German daylight raid came on 30 September; the Luftwaffe realized it was taking unacceptable losses and broke off the attack; occasional blitz raids hit London and other cities from time. In all some 43,000 civilians were killed. The Luftwaffe lost 1733 planes, the British, 915. The British victory resulted from more concentration, better radar, and better ground control.

===Strategic bombing theory===
The British had their own very well-developed theory of strategic bombing, and built the long-range bombers to implement it. Before 1944, however, the main German industrial targets were out of range, so the RAF bombers concentrated on military and transportation targets in France and Belgium. The Allies won air supremacy in Europe in 1944. That meant that Allied supplies and reinforcements would get through to the battlefront, but not the enemy&#x27;s. It meant the Allies could concentrate their strike forces wherever they pleased, and overwhelm the enemy with a preponderance of firepower. This was the basic Allied strategy, and it worked. Air superiority depended on having the fastest, most maneuverable fighters, in sufficient quantity, based on well-supplied airfields, within range. The RAF demonstrated the importance of speed and maneuverability in the Battle of Britain (1940), when its fast Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane fighters easily riddled the clumsy Stukas as they were pulling out of dives. The race to build the fastest fighter became one of the central themes of World War II.

===Expansion of the RAF===

The RAF underwent rapid expansion following the outbreak of war against Germany in 1939. This was aided by the Ottawa Agreement (also known as the Riverdale Agreement, after its chair, Lord Riverdale) that same year, between the governments of the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. As a result, under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan the training and operational postings of half of all aircrews from the RAF, RCAF, RAAF and RNZAF were integrated: a total of 167,000 personnel were trained under the plan, mostly in Canada. There were parallel arrangements between the UK and South Africa. Under Article XV of the agreement, 67 &quot;Article XV squadrons&quot; were formed in the name of other Commonwealth air forces, within RAF operational commands. In addition, many RAF squadrons included individual Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and South African aircrews.

Another 43 squadrons were formed during the war out of aircrews from occupied European countries, comprising designated Polish, French, Norwegian, Czechoslovakian, Dutch, Greek, Belgian and Yugoslavian units. Two &quot;Eagle Squadrons&quot; were formed from American volunteers when the US was neutral (1939–1941), as well as one made up of Argentinean nationals.

===Combined bomber offensive===

The combined bomber offensive was born out of the need to strike back at Germany during the years when the United Kingdom had no forces on the continent of Europe. Initially the bomber forces available for attacks were small, and the rules of engagement were so restricted that any attacks that were made were mostly ineffective. However, once France had fallen in the summer of 1940 that began to change.

During and after the Battle of Britain, bomber forces pounded the invasion fleets assembling in channel ports. However, they also flew a raid against Berlin after German bombs had fallen on London. The attack on Berlin by Bomber Command so enraged Hitler that he ordered the deliberate and systematic targeting of British cities in revenge. Throughout 1941, the size of the raids launched by Bomber Command slowly grew. However, due to the German defences raids could only generally be flown at night, and the navigational technology of the time simply did not allow even a large city to be accurately located.

The entry of America into the war in December 1941 did not initially change much. However, what did alter matters was the appointment of Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris as Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Bomber Command in early 1942. Harris was a zealous advocate of the area bombing of German cities. He put a new fire and drive into the operations of Bomber Command. During the summer of 1942, the first 1,000 bomber raids were launched on German cities. However, at that time, such large numbers of aircraft could only be put over the target by stripping training units of their aircraft temporarily.

Other important advances occurred in the technical field. The first navigation aid, GEE, was introduced to help pilots to find their targets. Window, small metal strips dropped from aircraft, was introduced to help confuse the German radars. Planes also got their own radar, the H2S radar system. It provided a radar map of the ground beneath the aircraft, allowing navigation with more accuracy to cities like Berlin which were at that time beyond the effective range of systems like Gee. However, probably the most important innovation to improve targeting accuracy was tactical, not technical. It was the introduction of the pathfinder system. Pathfinders were groups of specially trained aircrews who flew ahead of the main raid and marked the target. Their use greatly improved the accuracy and destructiveness of raids.

By early 1943, American forces were beginning to build up in large numbers in the UK. Bomber Command was joined in its bombing efforts by the Eighth Air Force. Where Bomber Command operated by night, the Eighth flew by day. Raids were often coordinated so that the same target was hit twice within 24 hours. Hamburg was the victim of one of the most destructive air raids in history during 1943. The city was easy to find using radar, being located on the distinctively shaped Elbe estuary. It was devastated in a large raid that ignited a firestorm and killed some 50,000 people.

The destruction of Hamburg was not to be repeated during the rest of 1943 and 1944. During that winter, Berlin was attacked a large number of times, with heavy losses being sustained by Bomber Command. A further force also joined the fray, with the Fifteenth Air Force and No. 205 Group RAF beginning to fly from Italy. During early 1944, the emphasis began to change. As the invasion of France drew closer, the independent role of the bomber forces was considerably reduced, and eventually were placed under the direction of General Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force. Harris and his American counterparts fought hard against being placed under Eisenhower, but they eventually lost.

Bomber Command heavily bombed targets in France and helped to paralyse the transport system of the country in time for the launching of Operation Overlord on 6 June 1944. Following Overlord, further direct support was provided to the troop, but Harris eventually succeeded in detaching his command from Eisenhower&#x27;s control. The striking of German cities resumed.

By the winter of 1944, the power of the British and American bomber forces had grown enormously. It was now routine for 1,000 bomber raids to be mounted by both American and British forces flying from the UK. American forces flying from Italy could also put several hundred aircraft above a target. Accuracy had improved, but it was still nowhere near good enough for &#x27;precision bombing&#x27; in the modern sense of the term. Precision was not a single building, it was at best a district of a city. The RAF and American AAF dropped two million tons of high explosives bombs on 60 German cities, killing more than half a million citizens (many of them prisoners forced to work in German munitions factories), and leaving 80,000 airmen dead.

As the amount of territory controlled by German forces decreased, the task of Bomber Command became somewhat easier, as more friendly territory was overflown during missions. The German night fighter defences were also reducing in strength due to the crippling of Germany&#x27;s fuel supplies by American bombing of synthetic oil plants. There remained one last great controversy during the war which would blacken the name of Bomber Command and surpass the firestorm of Hamburg in both destruction and casualties.

In February 1945, as Soviet forces closed in on the German city of Dresden, which had been largely spared of heavy bombing raids due to its historic status, they asked for attacks to be made on the extensive transport links around the population centre. Bomber Command and American forces obliged, subjecting the city to a series of extremely heavy raids. About 25,000 were killed in those raids, and questions were asked whether they were necessary so late in the war, or whether it was an effort to foreclose the &quot;stab in the back&quot; rumours of the sort the Nazis had exploited in the 1920s.

Bomber Command was destined to play no further large part in the war. A large number of RAF bombers were being prepared for deployment to Okinawa as Japan surrendered. Therefore, it was only at the hands of American strategic bombers and British and American carrier aircraft that Japan received attacks. There was to be no far eastern equivalent of the combined bomber offensive of Europe.

<text>André George Previn (; born Andreas Ludwig Priwin; April 6, 1929 – February 28, 2019) was a German-American pianist, composer, and conductor. His career had three major genres: Hollywood films, jazz, and classical music. In each he achieved success, and the latter two were part of his life until the end. In movies, he arranged and composed music. In jazz, he was a celebrated trio pianist, a piano-accompanist to singers of standards, and pianist-interpreter of songs from the &quot;Great American Songbook&quot;. In classical music, he also performed as a pianist but gained television fame as a conductor, and during his last thirty years created his legacy as a composer of art music.

Before the age of twenty, Previn began arranging and composing for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He would go on to be involved in the music of more than fifty films and would win four Academy Awards. He won ten Grammy Awards, for recordings in all three areas of his career, and then one more, for lifetime achievement. He served as music director of the Houston Symphony Orchestra (1967–1969), principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra (1968–1979), music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (1976–1984), of the Los Angeles Philharmonic (1985–1989), chief conductor of the Royal Philharmonic (1985–1992), and, after an avowed break from salaried posts, chief conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic (2002–2006). He also enjoyed a warm relationship with the Vienna Philharmonic.

==Early life==

Previn was born in Berlin to a Jewish family, the second son and last of three children of Charlotte (née Epstein) and Jack Previn, who was a lawyer, judge, and music teacher born in Graudenz, then in Germany but now in Poland. The eldest son, Steve Previn, became a film director. The year of Previn&#x27;s birth is disputed. Whereas most published reports give 1929, Previn himself stated that 1930 was his birth year. All three children received piano lessons and Previn was the one who enjoyed them from the start and displayed the most talent. At six, he enrolled at the Berlin Conservatory. In 1938, Previn&#x27;s father was told that his son was no longer welcome at the conservatory, despite André receiving a full scholarship in recognition of his abilities, on the grounds that he was Jewish.

In 1938, the family had applied for American visas and during the nine-month wait to obtain them, left Berlin for Paris. Previn&#x27;s father enrolled his son into the Conservatoire de Paris where André learned music theory. On October 20, 1938, the family left Paris and sailed to New York City. Their journey continued to Los Angeles, arriving on November 26. His father&#x27;s second cousin Charles Previn was music director for Universal Studios. Previn became a naturalized US citizen in 1943. He learned English, which was his third language after German and French, through comic books and other reading materials with a dictionary, and watching films. In 1946 he graduated from Beverly Hills High School and performed with Richard M. Sherman at the ceremony; Previn played the piano, accompanying Sherman, who played the flute.

==In the film studios==

Previn was involved in creating the music for over 50 films and won four Academy Awards for his work.

Previn&#x27;s career as a composer, conductor, and arranger at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios (MGM) began in 1946, while he was still in high school, after their music department noticed his work for a local radio program and hired him. Previn recalled that MGM was &quot;looking for somebody who was talented, fast, and cheap and, because I was a kid, I was all three. So they hired me to do piecework and I evidently did it very well.&quot; His first official credit was for an entry in the &quot;Lassie&quot; series, &quot;The Sun Comes Up&quot; (1949), which much later he thought was &quot;the most inept score you ever heard&quot; after seeing a television rerun.

While a full-time employee at MGM in 1950, Previn was drafted into the military. Beginning in 1951, while stationed with the Sixth Army Band at the Presidio of San Francisco, Previn took private conducting lessons for two years from Pierre Monteux, then conductor of the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, lessons which Previn valued highly. In 1953, Previn returned to Hollywood and focused his attention on film scores and jazz. Previn stayed at MGM for 16 years, but despite the secure job and good pay, he had come to feel increasingly confined, and consequently desired to pursue classical music outside of film scores. He resigned from MGM at 32, wanting &quot;to gamble with whatever talent I might have had&quot;.

His break with the film world in the 1960s, however, was not as complete and thorough as he would later claim. During this period, Previn won a 1964 Academy Award for &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. His film work continued until 1975&#x27;s &quot;Rollerball&quot;. Over his multi-decade film career, Previn was involved in the music of over 50 movies as composer, conductor, and/or performer.

==In jazz==

Previn described himself as a musician who played jazz, rather than a jazz musician. Nevertheless, he proved to be a gifted jazz-piano interpreter and arranger of songs from the &quot;Great American Songbook&quot;, winning the respect of prominent dedicated jazz artists. He separately worked as piano-accompanist to singers of jazz standards, from Ella Fitzgerald to Doris Day, recording prolifically. Like Oscar Peterson, whom he admired tremendously, and Bill Evans, he worked often as a trio pianist, usually with bass and drums, collaborating with dozens of famed jazz instrumentalists. Previn also memorably filmed TV shows with Peterson (1974) and Fitzgerald (1979). Jazz critic and historian Ted Gioia wrote in his book about West Coast jazz, the scene to which Previn belonged:[His] projects varied greatly in terms of quality and jazz content, but at his best Previn could be a persuasive, moving jazz musician. [...] Despite his deep roots in symphonic music, Previn largely steered clear of Third Stream classicism in his jazz work, aiming more at an earthy, hard-swinging piano style at times reminiscent of Horace Silver. Long before his eventual retreat from his jazz work, Previn had become something of a popularizer of jazz rather than a serious practitioner of the music. At his best, however, his music reflected a strong indigenous feel for the jazz idiom.

Dizzy Gillespie on Previn, said:He has the flow, you know, which a lot of guys don&#x27;t have and won&#x27;t ever get. Yeah. I heard him play and I knew. A lot of guys, they have the technique, the harmonic sense. They&#x27;ve got the perfect coordination. And, yeah, all that&#x27;s necessary. But you need something more, you know? Even if you only make an oooooooo, like that, you got to have the flow.

==As a conductor and composer of classical music==

=== As conductor ===

He was music director of the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and the Oslo Philharmonic, as well as the principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.

In 1967, Previn succeeded Sir John Barbirolli as music director of the Houston Symphony Orchestra. In 1968, he began his tenure as principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO), serving in that post until 1979. During his LSO tenure, he and the LSO appeared on the BBC Television programme &quot;André Previn&#x27;s Music Night&quot;. From 1975 to 1985, he was music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) and, in turn, had another television series with the PSO entitled &quot;Previn and the Pittsburgh&quot;. He was then principal conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra from 1985 to 1991.

In 1985, he became music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Although Previn&#x27;s tenure with the orchestra was deemed satisfactory from a professional perspective, other conductors, including Kurt Sanderling, Simon Rattle, and Esa-Pekka Salonen, did a better job at selling out concerts. Previn clashed frequently with Ernest Fleischmann (the LAPO&#x27;s Executive VP and General Manager), including the dispute when Fleischmann failed to consult Previn before naming Salonen as Principal Guest Conductor of the orchestra, complete with a tour of Japan. As a result of Previn&#x27;s objections, Salonen&#x27;s title and Japanese tour were withdrawn; however, shortly thereafter, in April 1989, Previn resigned. Four months later, Salonen was named Music Director Designate of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, officially taking the post of music director in October 1992.

Previn was music director of the Oslo Philharmonic from 2002 to 2006, and in 2009 he was appointed Principal Guest Conductor of Tokyo&#x27;s NHK Symphony Orchestra.

André Previn left two concert overtures, several tone poems, 14 concerti, a symphony for strings, incidental music to a British play; a varied body of chamber music (six violin sonatas, other scores for violin and piano; sonatas for bassoon, cello, clarinet, flute and oboe, each with piano; a waltz for two oboes and piano, three other trios, a string quartet with soprano, a clarinet quintet, a quintet for horn and strings, a nonet, an &quot;Octet for Eleven&quot; (for eleven players), and three works for brass ensemble); several works for solo piano; dozens of songs (in English and German); a monodrama for soprano, string quartet and piano (&quot;Penelope&quot;, completed just before he died); a musical each for New York and London (&quot;Coco&quot; and &quot;The Good Companions&quot;); and two successful operas.

==Television==

In his capacity as conductor, mainly, Previn enjoyed a long relationship with the medium of television. He featured in &quot;Meet André Previn&quot; (1969) on London Weekend Television, the &quot;Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show&quot; in 1971 and 1972 (BBC), &quot;André Previn&#x27;s Music Night&quot; (with the London Symphony Orchestra; three programmes in 1973, others in 1975 and 1976), and television interviews with other musicians. He made appearances on &quot;Call My Bluff&quot; and participated in documentaries about popular music and jazz during the 1970s and 1980s. In the United Kingdom he worked on TV with the London Symphony Orchestra. In the U.S. the television program &quot;Previn and the Pittsburgh&quot; (1977) featured him in collaboration with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.

=== &quot;Andrew Preview&quot; ===

British TV audiences witnessed his comic acting skills when he was introduced as &quot;Mr Andrew Preview&quot; (or &quot;Privet&quot;) on the Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show in 1971. This involved his conducting a performance of Edvard Grieg&#x27;s Piano Concerto with Eric Morecambe as the inept soloist, having been tricked into doing it by being told that Yehudi Menuhin would be his solo violinist. Playing the comedy straight, the annoyed Previn then remarks: &quot;I&#x27;ll go get my baton. It&#x27;s in Chicago.&quot; His comic timing made Morecambe immediately realise the sketch would be a success. Later in the sketch Previn accuses Morecambe of playing &quot;all the wrong notes&quot;; Morecambe grits his teeth, grabs Previn by the lapels, and retorts that he has been playing &quot;all the &quot;right&quot; notes, but &quot;not necessarily&quot; in the right order&quot;.

Previn recalled in 2005 that people in Britain still remember the sketch years later: &quot;Taxi drivers still call me Mr Preview&quot;. He later said he was happy that the sketch meant as much to everyone else as it did to him, and that several parts of it were (uncharacteristically for Morecambe and Wise) improvised.

Previn later appeared in the 1972 special as a bus conductor in a feature called &quot;I worked with Morecambe and Wise and look what happened to me&quot;. He made a further appearance in their eighth series. In this sketch, he is tricked into visiting the pair again, and they suggest that if he works with them again, he could receive a knighthood; he conducts a 1920s-style dance band as the pair sing, then meets them on stage and, after a lady in the audience greets him as &quot;Mr Preview&quot;, tells the pair: &quot;That&#x27;s not the Queen, that&#x27;s Mrs Mills!&quot; Finally, he joins the pair at the end of the episode in singing &quot;Bring Me Sunshine&quot;.

===&quot;Mozart on Tour&quot;===

Previn was host and narrator of the 13-part 1991 documentary series &quot;Mozart on Tour&quot;, which focused on Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s travels and how his music developed through them. He also performed and conducted Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 24 in C minor, K. 491, with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in one episode of the series, and in another episode conducted the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in a performance by Aleksandar Madžar of Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 27 in B-flat major, K. 595.

=== &quot;The Kindness of Strangers&quot; ===

Previn was the subject of a two-hour film by Tony Palmer entitled &quot;The Kindness of Strangers&quot; – after the closing words of his opera then in production, in 1998 – which followed Previn for a year at engagements around the world, and included interviews with Previn and rehearsals for the opera. The film was issued on DVD in 2009 by Voiceprint Records; an earlier issue had cut 30 minutes from it.

==Personal life==

Previn was married five times. His first marriage, in 1952, was to jazz singer Betty Bennett, with whom he had two daughters, Claudia Previn Stasny. and Alicia Previn. Previn divorced Bennett in 1957, a few months before she gave birth to Alicia.

In 1959, he married Dory Langan. A singer-songwriter, she became widely known as a lyricist with whom Previn collaborated on several Academy Award–nominated film scores during their marriage. They separated in 1968 once she found out his affair with Mia Farrow, a family friend, had resulted in a pregnancy. Distressed at his infidelity, Dory was hospitalized for a mental breakdown. Known professionally as Dory Previn, she resumed her career as a singer-songwriter. Her first album was &quot;On My Way to Where&quot; (1970), a critically acclaimed work whose confessional lyrics were described as &quot;searingly honest&quot;; it chronicled both her mental health struggles and the infidelity that she alleged had at once precipitated the end of her marriage to Previn and exacerbated her intermittent mental illness. In 2013, jazz singer Kate Dimbleby and pianist Naadia Sheriff revisited Dory Previn&#x27;s musical reflections on her marriage to Previn in the London cabaret show &quot;Beware of Young Girls: The Dory Previn Story&quot;.

Previn&#x27;s third marriage, in 1970, was to Mia Farrow, whom he began dating in 1968. Previn and Farrow had three biological children together — fraternal twins Matthew and Sascha, born before Previn and Farrow were married, and Fletcher, born in 1974. They then adopted Vietnamese infants Lark Song and Summer &quot;Daisy&quot; Song (born October 6, 1974), followed by Soon-Yi Previn, a Korean child whose age a physician&#x27;s bone scan placed between six and eight years old and whose unknown birth date her adoptive parents estimated as October 8, 1970. Previn and Farrow divorced in 1979. Lark died on Christmas Day 2008, aged 35; reports at the time suggested she had died of AIDS-related pneumonia. In the aftermath of the scandal involving Soon-Yi and Mia Farrow&#x27;s partner Woody Allen, Previn said of Soon-Yi, &quot;She does not exist.&quot;

Previn&#x27;s longest marriage was his fourth. In January 1982, he married Heather Sneddon. They had a son, Lucas Alexander, and an adopted daughter, Li-An Mary. Previn wrote a brief memoir of his early years in Hollywood, &quot;No Minor Chords&quot;, which was published in 1991, edited by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and dedicated to Heather. This marriage ended in divorce after 17 years.

His fifth marriage, in 2002, was to the German violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, for whom in the previous year he had composed his Violin Concerto. They announced their divorce in August 2006, but continued to work together in concerts afterwards.

==Honors and awards==

Previn was nominated for 11 Academy Awards. He won four times, in 1958, 1959, 1963 and 1964. He is one of the few composers to have accomplished the feat of winning back-to-back Oscars, and one of only two to have done so on two occasions. Previn was the first person in the history of the Academy Awards to receive three nominations in one year (for the 1960 awards).

In 1970 he was nominated for a Tony Award as part of &quot;Coco&quot;&#x27;s nomination for Best Musical. In 1974, he composed the musical score for &quot;The Good Companions&quot; starring John Mills in London. In 1977 he became an Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Music. The 1977 television show &quot;Previn and the Pittsburgh&quot; was nominated for three Emmy awards.

Previn was appointed an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1996. (Not being a citizen of a Commonwealth realm, he was permitted to use the post-nominal letters KBE but was not styled &quot;Sir André&quot;.) Previn received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1998 in recognition of his contributions to classical music and opera in the United States. In 2005 he was awarded the international Glenn Gould Prize and in 2008 won &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award for his work in classical, film, and jazz music. In 2010, the Recording Academy honored Previn with a Lifetime Achievement Grammy.

==Death==

Previn died on February 28, 2019, at home in Manhattan at the age of 89.

==Recordings==

Previn&#x27;s discography contains hundreds of recordings in film, jazz, classical music, theatre, and contemporary classical music. Because of the huge number of recordings, the following lists are necessarily highly selective. A full discography (including LP/CD record codes) is available in Frédéric Döhl: &quot;André Previn. Musikalische Vielseitigkeit und ästhetische Erfahrung&quot;, Stuttgart 2012, pp. 295–319.

=== Film music ===

Most of the films which incorporate Previn&#x27;s music are still available as videos/DVDs and/or as soundtrack records. Some of his soundtracks have been reissued in recent years, including those from &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot;, &quot;Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot;, &quot;Inside Daisy Clover&quot;, and &quot;Dead Ringer&quot;.

=== Jazz recordings===

Previn made dozens of jazz recordings, as both leader and sideman, primarily during two periods: from 1945 to 1967, and from 1989 to 2001, with just a handful of recordings in between or afterward. He also did crossover recordings with such classical singers as Eileen Farrell, Leontyne Price and Kiri Te Kanawa, as well as several easy-listening records with piano and orchestra in the 1960s (beginning with &quot;Like Young: Secret Songs for Young Lovers&quot;, 1959, with David Rose and His Orchestra).

Following his performance on Shelly Manne&#x27;s recording &quot;Modern Jazz Performances of Songs from My Fair Lady&quot; in 1956, Previn released several albums of jazz interpretations of songs from broadway musicals as well as several solo piano recordings focused on the songbooks of popular composers (&quot;André Previn Plays Songs by Vernon Duke&quot;, 1958; &quot;André Previn Plays Songs by Harold Arlen&quot;, 1960; &quot;Ballads. Solo Jazz Standards&quot;, 1996; &quot;Alone: Ballads for Solo Piano&quot;, 2007), the late recording of songs by Harold Arlen with singer Sylvia McNair and bass player David Finck (&quot;Come Rain or Shine: The Harold Arlen Songbook&quot;, 1996), and his TV shows with Oscar Peterson (1974) – which Marlon Brando called &quot;one of the greatest hours I ever saw on television&quot; – and Ella Fitzgerald (1979) respectively.

===Classical music===

====Orchestral music====
Previn&#x27;s recorded repertory as a conductor focused on standards of the Classical, Romantic and Modern eras. In opera, however, he recorded only &quot;Der Schauspieldirektor&quot;, &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;, and Ravel&#x27;s two short operas, as well as his own &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;.

He favored the symphonic music of Berlioz, Brahms and Strauss, and placed a special emphasis on violin and piano concertos and on ballets. Only a few of his recordings were of music before Haydn and Mozart (both favourites on his programmes) or of atonal or serial avant-garde pieces. In 20th-century music his repertory highlit specific composers of late Romanticism and Modernism: Barber, Britten, Gershwin, Korngold, Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff, Ravel, Shostakovich, Strauss, Vaughan Williams, Walton and Shapero. Previn recorded for RCA, EMI, Telarc and Deutsche Grammophon.

Noteworthy as interpretations, for various reasons, are his recordings of Shostakovich&#x27;s Fifth Symphony (for RCA in 1965), Walton&#x27;s First Symphony (1966), the Vaughan Williams symphonies (1967–72), Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Second Symphony (for EMI in 1970), Rachmaninoff&#x27;s piano concertos (for Decca in 1970–71, with Vladimir Ashkenazy), Walton&#x27;s &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot; (EMI, 1972), Orff&#x27;s &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; (1974) and Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1976), all with the London Symphony Orchestra; and Strauss&#x27;s horn concertos (for DG in 1996), with the Vienna Philharmonic.

<text>MATH-MATIC is the marketing name for the AT-3 (Algebraic Translator 3) compiler, an early programming language for the UNIVAC I and UNIVAC II.

MATH-MATIC was written beginning around 1955 by a team led by Charles Katz under the direction of Grace Hopper. A preliminary manual was produced in 1957 and a final manual the following year.

Syntactically, MATH-MATIC was similar to Univac&#x27;s contemporaneous business-oriented language, FLOW-MATIC, differing in providing algebraic-style expressions and floating-point arithmetic, and arrays rather than record structures.

== Notable features ==

Expressions in MATH-MATIC could contain numeric exponents, including decimals and fractions, by way of a custom typewriter.

MATH-MATIC programs could include inline assembler sections of ARITH-MATIC code and UNIVAC machine code.

The UNIVAC I had only 1000 words of memory, and the successor UNIVAC II as little as 2000. MATH-MATIC allowed for larger programs, automatically generating code to read overlay segments from UNISERVO tape as required. The compiler attempted to avoid splitting loops across segments.

== Influence ==

In proposing the collaboration with the ACM that led to ALGOL 58, the Gesellschaft für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik wrote that it considered MATH-MATIC the closest available language to its own proposal.

In contrast to Backus&#x27; FORTRAN, MATH-MATIC did not emphasise execution speed of compiled programs. The UNIVAC machines did not have floating-point hardware, and MATH-MATIC was translated via A-3 (ARITH-MATIC) pseudo-assembler code rather than directly to UNIVAC machine code, limiting its usefulness.

<text>The MOS Technology 6581/8580 SID (Sound Interface Device) is the built-in programmable sound generator chip of the Commodore CBM-II, Commodore 64, Commodore 128, and MAX Machine home computers.

Together with the VIC-II graphics chip, the SID was instrumental in making the C64 the best-selling home computer in history, and is partly credited for initiating the demoscene.

== History ==

The SID was devised by engineer Bob Yannes, who later co-founded the Ensoniq digital synthesizer and sampler company. Yannes headed a team that included himself, two technicians and a CAD operator, who designed and completed the chip in five months in the latter half of 1981. Yannes was inspired by previous work in the synthesizer industry and was not impressed by the current state of computer sound chips. Instead, he wanted a high-quality instrument chip, which is the reason why the SID has features like the envelope generator, previously not found in home computer sound chips.

Emphasis during chip design was on high-precision frequency control, and the SID was originally designed to have 32 independent voices, sharing a common wavetable lookup scheme that would be time multiplexed. However, these features could not be finished in time, so instead the mask work for a certain working oscillator was simply replicated three times across the chip&#x27;s surface, creating three voices each with its own oscillator. Another feature that was not incorporated in the final design was a frequency look-up table for the most common musical notes, a feature that was dropped because of space limitations. The support for an audio input pin was a feature Yannes added without asking, which in theory would have allowed the chip to be used as a simple effect processor. The masks were produced in 7-micrometer technology to gain a high yield; the state of the art at the time was 6-micrometer technologies.

The chip, like the first product using it (the Commodore 64), was finished in time for the Consumer Electronics Show in the first weekend of January 1982. Even though Yannes was partly displeased with the result, his colleague Charles Winterble said: &quot;This thing is already 10 times better than anything out there and 20 times better than it needs to be.&quot;

The specifications for the chip were not used as a blueprint. Rather, they were written as the development work progressed, and not all planned features made it into the final product. Yannes claims he had a feature-list of which three quarters made it into the final design. The later revision (8580) was revised to more closely match the specifications. For example, the 8580 slightly improved upon the ability to perform a binary AND between two waveforms, which the SID can only do in an odd and illogical manner that results in messy, and in some cases nearly silent, waveforms. Wave combinations on the 8580 result in cleaner waveforms than on the 6581, although irregularities are still present. Another feature that differs between the two revisions is the filter, as the 6581 version is far away from the specification.

== Design ==

The SID is a mixed-signal integrated circuit, featuring both digital and analog circuitry. All control ports are digital, while the output ports are analog. The SID features three voices, with four types of waveforms able to be selected per voice: pulse wave (with variable duty cycle), triangle wave, sawtooth wave, and pseudorandom noise (called white noise in documentation). Multiple waveform types may be selected simultaneously, which produces certain complex/combined waveforms. The oscillators of each voice are built on a 24-bit phase accumulator. A voice playing a triangle waveform may be ring-modulated with one of the other voices, where the triangle waveform&#x27;s bits are inverted when the MSB of the modulating voice&#x27;s accumulator is set, producing a discontinuity and inversion of direction with the triangle&#x27;s ramp. Voices may also be hard-synced to each other, where the synced voice&#x27;s oscillator is reset whenever the MSB of the syncing voice&#x27;s accumulator is increased. If both ring modulation and hard-sync are set to affect the same voice, the two effects are combined. The voice that ring modulates and/or syncs a given affected voice is determined by the following pattern: voice 1 affects voice 2, voice 2 affects voice 3, and voice 3 affects voice 1.

Each voice may be routed into a common, digitally controlled analog multimode filter, which is constructed with aid of external capacitors to the chip. The filter has lowpass, bandpass and highpass outputs, which can be individually selected for final output amplification via the master volume register. Filter modes can also be combined. For example, using a combined state of lowpass and highpass results in a notch (or inverted bandpass) output.
The programmer may vary the filter&#x27;s cutoff frequency and resonance. An external audio-in port enables external audio to be passed through the filter.

The ring modulation, filter, and programming techniques such as arpeggio (rapid cycling between frequencies to make chord-like sounds) together produce the characteristic feel and sound of SID music.

Due to imperfect manufacturing technologies of the time and poor separation between the analog and digital parts of the chip, the 6581&#x27;s output (before the amplifier stage) was always slightly biased from the zero level. Each time the volume register was altered, an audible click was produced. By quickly adjusting the amplifier&#x27;s gain through the main 4-bit volume register, this bias could be modulated as PCM, resulting in a &quot;virtual&quot; fourth channel allowing 4-bit digital sample playback. The glitch was known and used from an early point on, first by Electronic Speech Systems to produce sampled speech in games such as &quot;Impossible Mission&quot; (1984, Epyx) and &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984, Activision). The first instance of samples being used in actual musical compositions was by Martin Galway in &quot;Arkanoid&quot; (1987, Imagine), although he had copied the idea from an earlier drum synthesizer package called Digidrums. The length of sampled sound playback was limited first by memory and later technique. Kung Fu Fighting (1986), a popular early sample, has a playback length measured in seconds. c64mp3 (2010) and Cubase64 (2010) demonstrate playback lengths measured in minutes. Also, it was hugely CPU intensive - one had to output the samples very fast (in comparison to the speed of the 6510 CPU).

The better manufacturing technology in the 8580 used in the later revisions of Commodore 64C and the Commodore 128 DCR caused the bias to almost entirely disappear, causing the digitized sound samples to become very quiet. Fortunately, the volume level could be mostly restored with either a hardware modification (biasing the audio-in pin), or more commonly a software trick involving using the Pulse waveform to intentionally recreate the required bias. The software trick generally renders one voice temporarily unusable, although clever musical compositions can make this problem less noticeable. An excellent example of this quality improvement noticeably reducing a sampled channel can be found in the introduction to Electronic Arts&#x27; game Skate or Die (1987). The guitar riff played is all but missing when played on the Commodore 64c or the Commodore 128.

At the X&#x27;2008 demo party, a completely new method of playing digitized samples was unveiled. The method allows for an unprecedented four (software-mixed) channels of 8-bit samples with optional filtering on top of all samples, as well as two ordinary SID sound channels. The method works by resetting the oscillator using the waveform generator test bit, quickly ramping up the new waveform with the Triangle waveform selected, and then disabling all waveforms, resulting in the DAC continuing to output the last value---which is the desired sample. This continues for as long as two scanlines, which is ample time for glitch-free, arbitrary sample output. It is however more CPU-intensive than the 4-bit volume register DAC trick described above. Because the filtering in a SID chip is applied after the waveform generators, samples produced this way can be filtered normally.

The original manual for the SID mentions that if several waveforms are enabled at the same time, the result will be a binary AND between them. What happens in reality is that the input to the waveform DAC pins receives several waveforms at once. For instance, the Triangle waveform is made with a separate XOR circuit and a shift-to-left circuit. The top bit drives whether the XOR circuit inverts the accumulator value seen by the DAC. Thus, enabling triangle and sawtooth simultaneously causes adjacent accumulator bits in the DAC input to mix. (The XOR circuit does not come to play because it is always disabled whenever the sawtooth waveform is selected.) The pulse waveform is built by joining all the DAC bits together via a long strip of polysilicon, connected to the pulse control logic that digitally compares current accumulator value to the pulse width value. Thus, selecting the pulse waveform together with any other waveform causes every bit on the DAC to partially mix, and the loudness of the waveform is affected by the state of the pulse.

The noise generator is implemented as a 23-bit-length Fibonacci LFSR (Feedback polynomial: x^22+x^17+1). When using noise waveform simultaneously with any other waveform, the pull-down via waveform selector tends to quickly reduce the XOR shift register to 0 for all bits that are connected to the output DAC. As the zeroes shift in the register when the noise is clocked, and no 1-bits are produced to replace them, a situation can arise where the XOR shift register becomes fully zeroed. Luckily, the situation can be remedied by using the waveform control test bit, which in that condition injects one 1-bit into the XOR shift register. Some musicians are also known to use noise&#x27;s combined waveforms and test bit to construct unusual sounds.

The 6581 and 8580 differ from each other in several ways. The original 6581 was manufactured using the older NMOS process, which used 12V DC to operate. The 6581 is very sensitive to static discharge and if they weren&#x27;t handled properly the filters would stop working, explaining the large number of dead 6581s in the market. The 8580 was made using the HMOS-II process, which requires less power (9V DC), and therefore makes the IC run cooler. The 8580 is thus far more durable than the 6581. Also, due to more stable waveform generators, the bit-mixing effects are less noticeable and thus the combined waveforms come close to matching the original SID specification (which stated that they will be combined as a binary AND). The filter is also very different between the two models. The 6581 cutoff range resembles a sigmoid function on a log scale and varies wildly between chips, while the cutoff range on the 8580 is a straight line on a linear scale and is both more consistent between chips and close to the designers&#x27; actual specifications. The 8580 filter can achieve higher resonances as well. Additionally, a better separation between the analog and the digital circuits made the 8580&#x27;s output less noisy and distorted. The noise in 6xxx-series systems can be reduced by disconnecting the audio-in pin.

The consumer version of the 8580 was rebadged the 6582, even though the die on the chip is identical to a stock 8580 chip, including the &#x27;8580R5&#x27; mark. Dr. Evil Laboratories used it in their SID Symphony expansion cartridge (sold to Creative Micro Designs in 1991), and it was used in a few other places as well, including one PC sound-card.

Despite its documented shortcomings, many SID musicians prefer the flawed 6581 chip over the corrected 8580 chip, some even seeing the flaws as actual &#x27;features&#x27; that made the SID chip distinct from other sound chips at the time. The main reason for this is that the filter produces strong distortion that is sometimes used to produce simulation of instruments such as a distorted electric guitar. Also, the highpass component of the filter was mixed in 3 dB attenuated compared to the other outputs, making the sound more bassy. In addition to nonlinearities in filter, the D/A circuitry used in the waveform generators produces yet more additional distortion that made its sound richer in character.

== Features ==
* Three separately programmable independent audio oscillators (able to produce 65,535 equally spaced frequencies on a linear scale, 0.0625–4095.9375 Hz range on a 1 MHz clock)
* Four distinct waveforms per audio oscillator (triangle, sawtooth, pulse, noise). Any combination of triangle, sawtooth, and pulse may be selected at the same time to produce additional waveforms.

* Random number/modulation generator (via reading the state of the 3rd oscillator or 3rd envelope generator)

== Revisions ==



No instances reading &quot;6581 R1&quot; ever reached the market. In fact, Yannes has stated that &quot;[the] SID chip came out pretty well the first time, it made sound. Everything we needed for the show was working after the second pass.&quot; High-resolution photos of Charles Winterble&#x27;s prototype C64 show the markings &quot;MOS 6581 2082&quot;, the last number being a date code indicating that his prototype SID chip was produced during the 20th week of 1982, which would be within 6 days of May 17, 1982.

These are the known revisions of the various SID chips: (date codes are in WWYY w=week y=year format)

The SID (Sound Interface Device) chip, notable for its fusion of digital and analog technologies, was a cornerstone in the system architecture of the Commodore 64 amongst other models. The chip boasted three distinct voices each with precise and varying waveform options—it also included a 12 dB/octave multimode filter. Over the years, the design of this filter differed with each subsequent chip revision, lending each its unique sonic fingerprint.

One of the earliest models of the SID chip, the 6581, initially found its way into Commodore 64 computers between 1982 and around 1986. This model underwent several notable revisions including the 6581 R1, a prototype model which was only seen on CES machines and development prototypes and had a date code of 4981 to 0882.

This model was renowned for its full 12-bit filter cutoff range and while the precise number of models produced remains unknown, it is estimated to be between 50 and 100 chips, being packaged in ceramic.

Following the R1, were the 6581 R2, 6581 R3, 6581 R4 AR, and finally, the 6581 R4. The evolution of the 6581 iterations saw minor changes to the protection/buffering of the input pins, adjustment of the silicon grade, and changes to its packaging. However, no substantial alterations were made to the filter section throughout these progressions.

Moving to the latter models, the updated 8580 SID chipped marked its introduction in newer versions of the Commodore 64 machines. Technically compatible with the 6581 software, the 8580 brought with it a unique sound character due to specific adjustments in the filter structure.

The sonic differences noticed between the two models, 6581 and 8580, were attributed broadly to the nuances in the analog filters, and intrinsic design distortions. These sound characteristics were heavily influenced by updates in the circuitry and quality differences in the material batches used in the various production runs of the chips.

The SID chip encompassed an ongoing journey of specifications that evolved in tandem with the chip design process. Not all initial features made it into the final blueprint. However, subsequent iterations like the 8580 model were meticulously revised to match more closely with the original specifications, specifically focusing on waveform combinations and filter functionality.

Some of these chips are marked &quot;CSG&quot; (Commodore Semiconductor Group) with the Commodore logo, while others are marked &quot;MOS&quot;. This includes chips produced during the same week (and thus, receiving the same date code), indicating that at least two different factory lines were in operation during that week. The markings of chips varied by factory, and even by line within a factory, throughout most of the manufacturing run of the chip.

== Remarking and forgery ==

Since 6581 and 8580 SID ICs are no longer produced, they have become highly sought after. In late 2007, various defective chips started appearing on eBay as supposedly &quot;new&quot;. Some of these remarked SIDs have a defective filter, but some also have defective channels/noise generators, and some are completely dead.

Fake SID chips have also been supplied to unwitting buyers from unscrupulous manufacturers in China; the supplied chips are laser-etched with completely bogus markings, and the chip inside the package is not a SID at all.

== Uses ==

=== Game audio ===

The majority of games produced for the Commodore 64 made use of the SID chip, with sounds ranging from simple clicks and beeps to complex musical extravaganzas or even entire digital audio tracks. Due to the technical mastery required to implement music on the chip, and its versatile features compared to other sound chips of the era, composers for the Commodore 64 have described the SID as a musical instrument in its own right. Most software did not use the full capabilities of SID, however, because the incorrect published specifications caused programmers to only use well-documented functionality. Some early software, by contrast, relied on the specifications, resulting in inaudible sound effects.

Well known composers of game music for this chip are Rob Hubbard, known for titles such as &quot;Commando&quot;, &quot;Monty on the run&quot;, &quot;International Karate&quot;, &quot;Sanxion&quot;, &quot;Skate or Die!&quot;, and Martin Galway, known for &quot;Wizball&quot;, &quot;Arkanoid&quot; and &quot;Times of Lore&quot;. Other noteworthies include Jeroen Tel (&quot;Cybernoid&quot;, &quot;Turbo Outrun&quot;, &quot;Robocop 3&quot; and &quot;Myth&quot;), Ben Daglish (&quot;The Last Ninja&quot;, &quot;Jack the Nipper&quot;, &quot;Firelord&quot;, &quot;Gauntlet&quot;), David Dunn (&quot;Finders Keepers&quot; and &quot;Flight Path 737&quot;), David Whittaker (&quot;Speedball&quot;, &quot;BMX Simulator&quot;, &quot;Glider Rider&quot;) and Chris Hülsbeck (&quot;R-Type&quot;, &quot;Turrican&quot; and &quot;The Great Giana Sisters&quot;).

=== Recordings ===

The fact that many enthusiasts prefer the real chip sound over software emulators has led to several recording projects aiming to preserve the authentic sound of the SID chip for modern hardware.

The sid.oth4 project has over 380 songs of high quality MP3 available recorded on hardsid hardware and the SOASC= project has the entire High Voltage SID Collection (HVSC) released with 49 (over 35,000 songs) recorded from real Commodore 64s in a high quality MP3 file. Both projects emphasize the importance of preserving the authentic sound of the SID chip. In 2016, the Unepic Stoned High SID Collection (USHSC) was launched. It is a YouTube channel with over 50,000 SID tunes uploaded as single videos. The USHSC is based on both the SOASC= and HVSC, but also uploads recordings of recent SID music released at the Commodore Scene Database (CSDb) site. The channel features playlists containing roughly 5000 tunes each.

== Reimplementations and derivatives ==

=== Emulation ===
* In 1989 on the Amiga computer, the demo &quot;The 100 Most Remembered C64 Tunes&quot; and later the PlaySID application was released, developed by Per Håkan Sundell and Ron Birk. This was one of the first attempts to emulate the SID in software only, and also introduced the file format for representing songs made on the C64 using the SID chip. This later spawned the creation of similar applications for other platforms as well as the creation of a community of people fascinated by SID music, resulting in &quot;The High Voltage SID Collection&quot; which contains over 57,000 SID tunes.

A SID file contains the 6510 program code and associated data needed to replay the music on the SID. The SID files have the MIME media type codice_1.

The actual file format of a SID file has had several versions. The older standard is PSID (current version V4). The newer standard, RSID, is intended for music that requires a more complete emulation of the Commodore 64 hardware.

The SID file format is not a native format used on the Commodore 64 or 128, but a format specifically created for emulator-assisted music players such as &quot;PlaySID &quot;, &quot;Sidplay&quot; and &quot;JSidplay2&quot;. However, there are loaders like &quot;RealSIDPlay&quot; and converters such as &quot;PSID64&quot; that make it possible to play a substantial portion of SID files on original Commodore computers.
* SIDPlayer, developed by Christian Bauer and released in 1996 for the BeOS operating system, was the first SID emulator to replicate the filter section of the SID chip using a second-order Infinite impulse response filter as an approximation.
* In June 1998, a cycle-based SID emulator engine called reSID became available. The all-software emulator, available with C++ source code, is licensed under the GPL by the author, Dag Lem. In 2008, Antti Lankila significantly improved the filter and distortion simulation in reSID. The improvements were included in VICE version 2.1 as well.
* In 2007 the JSidplay2 project was released, a pure Java based SID player developed by Ken Händel.

=== Hardware using the SID chip ===

* In 1989 Innovation Computer developed the Innovation Sound Standard, an IBM PC compatible sound card with a SID chip and a game port. MicroProse promised software support for the card, and Commodore BASIC programs that used SID required little conversion to run on GW-BASIC.
* In 1997, an electronic musical instrument utilizing the SID chip as its synthesis engine was released. It is called the SidStation, built around the 6581 model SID chip (as opposed to the newer 8580), and it&#x27;s produced by Swedish company Elektron. As the SID chip had been discontinued for years, Elektron allegedly bought up almost all of the remaining stock. In 2004, Elektron released the Monomachine pattern-based sequencer with optional keyboard. The Monomachine contains several synthesis engines, including an emulated 6581 oscillator using a DSP.
* In 1999 HardSID, another PC sound card, was released. The card uses from one to four SID chips and allows a PC to utilize the sound capabilities of the chip directly, instead of by emulation via generic sound cards (e.g. SoundBlaster).
* The Catweasel from German company Individual Computers, a PCI + Zorro multiformat floppy disk controller and digital joystick adapter for PCs, Macs, and Amigas, includes a hardware SID option, i.e. an option to insert one or two real SID chips in a socket for use when playing codice_2 files.
* The MIDIbox SID is a MIDI-controlled synthesizer which can contain up to eight SID chips. It is a free open source project using a PIC microcontroller. Control of the synthesizer is realized with software or via a control panel with knobs, LEDs, LCD, etc., which may optionally be mounted on a keyboardless Commodore 64 body.
* The Prophet64 is a cartridge for the Commodore 64. It features four separate music applications, mimicking everything from modern sequencers to the Roland TB-303/909 series. With an optional User Port peripheral, the Prophet64 may synchronized to other equipment using DIN Sync standard (SYNC 24). The website now states &quot;Prophet64 has been replaced with the MSSIAH.&quot;
* The MSSIAH is a cartridge for the Commodore 64 that replaces the Prophet64.
* Artist/hacker Paul Slocum developed the Cynthcart cartridge that enables you to turn your C64 into an analogue synthesizer. Its successor, Cynthcart 2, added MIDI in, out and thru ports.
* The Parallel Port SID Interface allows those with very slim budgets to connect the SID chip to a PC.
*In 2003 a SID interface (and software to play Commodore 64 tunes) was released for the Z80 based Sam Coupé computer supporting both the 6581 and the 8580.
* In May 2009 the SID chip was interfaced to the BBC Micro and BBC Master range of computers via the 1 MHz bus allowing music written for the SID chip on the Commodore 64 to be ported and played on the BBC Micro.
* In October 2009 thrashbarg&#x27;s project interfaced an SID chip to an ATmega8 to play MIDI files on a MOS 6581 SID.
* In March 2010 STG published the SIDBlaster/USB - an open source, open hardware implementation of the SID that connects to (and is powered by) a USB port, using an FTDI chip for the USB interface and a PIC to interface the SID.
* In August 2010 SuperSoniqs published the Playsoniq, a cartridge for MSX computers, with (in addition to other features) a real SID on it, ready to use on any MSX machine.
* In May 2015 Gianluca Ghettini developed SidBerry, an open source, open hardware board to interface a MOS 6581 SID chip to a RaspberryPi and play standard SID music files
* In 2016 Thibaut Varene published exSID, a USB audio device that can control a real 6581 and 8580 SID chip and natively playback most SID tunes.

=== Hardware reimplementations ===
* In 2008 the HyperSID project was released. HyperSID is a VSTi which acts like a MIDI controller for HyperSID hardware unit (synthesizer based on SID chip) and developed by HyperSynth company.
* The SwinSID is hardware emulation of the SID using an Atmel AVR processor, also featuring a real SID player based on the Atmel AVR processor.
* The V-SID 1.0 project (code name SID 6581D, &#x27;D&#x27; for digital) from David was born in 2005. This project is a hardware emulation of the SID chip from the Bob Yannes&#x27;s interview, datasheets. The V-SID 1.0 engine had been implemented in a FPGA EP1C12 Cyclone from ALTERA, on an ALTIUM development board, and emulates all the characteristics of the original SID, except the filter which is a digital version (IIR filter controlled by a CPU).
* The PhoenixSID 65X81 project (2006) aimed to faithfully create the SID sound using modern hardware. The workings of a SID chip were recreated on an FPGA, based on interviews with the SID&#x27;s creator, original datasheets, and comparisons with real SID chips. It was distinguished from similar attempts by its use of real analog circuitry instead of emulation for the legendary SID filter. However, the project was discontinued, because George Pantazopoulos, who was the head of this project, died on April 23, 2007, at the age of 29.
* The C64 Direct-to-TV emulates large portions the SID hardware, minus certain features such as (most notably) the filters. It reduces the entire C64 to a small circuit that fits into a joystick while sacrificing some compatibility.
* The SIDcog is a software SID emulator running on the Parallax Propeller. All three channels can be emulated on one of the Propeller&#x27;s eight COG&#x27;s.
* The ARMSID is a &quot;plug &amp; play&quot; replacement of the MOS 6581 and MOS 8580 with analog inputs support.
* The FPGASID is a FPGA based SID replica providing high reproduction quality of the original device including all features such as the audio filters and the paddle registers. The device is a full featured stereo solution and can replace two SID chips in a single SID socket. Hardware base is an Altera MAX10 FPGA.

<doc id="202120" wikidata="Q1324102" url="?curid=202120" title="Counterweight">
<text>A counterweight is a weight that, by applying an opposite force, provides balance and stability of a mechanical system. The purpose of a counterweight is to make lifting the load faster and more efficient, which saves energy and causes less wear and tear on the lifting machine.

Counterweights are often used in traction lifts (elevators), cranes and funfair rides. In these applications, the expected load multiplied by the distance that load will be spaced from the central support (called the &quot;tipping point&quot;) must be equal to the counterweight&#x27;s mass times its distance from the tipping point in order to prevent over-balancing either side. This distance times mass is called the load moment.

By extension, a counterbalance force balances or offsets another force, as when two objects of equal weight, power, or influence are acting in opposition to each other.

==Examples==
;Trebuchet: There are five major components of a trebuchet: beam, counterweight, frame, guide chute, and sling. After the counterweight drops from a platform on the frame, gravity pulls the counterweight and pivots the beam. Without the counterweight, the beam could not complete the arc that allows the sling to accurately release the projectile.

;Crankshaft: A counterweight is also used in many rotating systems to reduce vibrations due to imbalances in the rotating assembly. A typical example is counterweights on crankshafts in piston engines.

;Desk lamp: Some balanced arm lamps work with a counterweight to keep the arm and lamp in the desired position.

;Elevator: In traction (non-hydraulic) elevators, a heavy counterweight counterbalances the load of the elevator carriage, so the motor lifts much less of the carriage&#x27;s weight (specifically, the counterweight is the weight of the carriage plus 40-50% of its rated capacity). The counterweight also increases the ascending acceleration force and decreases the descending acceleration force to reduce the amount of power needed by the motor. The elevator carriage and the counterweights both have wheels that roll on rails to prevent irregular movement and provide a smoother ride for the passengers.

;Space elevator: a proposed structure designed to transport material from a celestial body&#x27;s surface into space. Many variants have been proposed, but the concept most often refers to an elevator that reaches from the surface of the Earth to geostationary outer space, with a counterweight attached at its outer end. By attaching a counterweight at the end, upward centrifugal force from the Earth&#x27;s rotation ensures that the cable remains stretched taut, countering the gravitational pull on the lower sections and thereby allowing the elevator to remain upright. The counterweight itself could assume one of several forms: 
#a heavy, captured asteroid;
#a space dock, space station or spaceport positioned past geostationary orbit; or
#an extension of the cable itself far beyond geostationary orbit.

Metronome: A wind-up mechanical metronome has an adjustable weight and spring mechanism that allows the speed to be adjusted by placement of the weight on the spindle. The tempo speed is decreased by moving the weight to a higher spindle marking or increased by moving it to a lower marking.

; Crane: The tower crane (see picture) is a modern form of balance crane that is fixed to the ground. A horizontal boom is balanced asymmetrically across the top of the tower. The long arm carries the lifting gear. The short arm is called the machinery arm; this holds the motors and electronics to operate the crane, as well as the concrete counterweights.&lt;ref name=&quot;howstuffworks/crane&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* Vertical-lift bridge
* Drawbridge
* Bascule bridge
* Forklift

<text>Maureen Paula O&#x27;Sullivan (May 17, 1911 – June 23, 1998) was an Irish actress who played Jane in the &quot;Tarzan&quot; series of films during the era of Johnny Weissmuller. She starred in dozens of feature films across a span of more than half a century and performed with such stars as Laurence Olivier, Greta Garbo, Fredric March, William Powell, Myrna Loy, Marie Dressler, Wallace Beery, Lionel Barrymore, the Marx Brothers and Woody Allen. In 2020, she was listed at number eight on &quot;The Irish Times&quot; list of Ireland&#x27;s greatest film actors.

O&#x27;Sullivan was born in Boyle, County Roscommon, Ireland. After attending schools in Dublin, England, and France, she moved to Hollywood to work for Fox Film Corporation. O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s film career began in the 1930s, and she eventually became a contract player at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. She is best known for playing Jane Parker in six Tarzan films between 1932 and 1942, alongside Johnny Weissmuller.

O&#x27;Sullivan also appeared in films such as &quot;The Thin Man&quot; (1934), &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (1935), &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; (1937), &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1940), and &quot;Maisie Was a Lady&quot; (1941). She took a break from acting to care for her family but later returned to the screen in films directed by her husband, John Farrow. She continued to work in film and theater throughout her life, including appearances in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (1986), Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; (1986), and in &quot;Stranded&quot; (1987).

O&#x27;Sullivan was married twice, first to John Farrow, with whom she had seven children, including actress Mia Farrow, and later to businessman James Cushing. She became a U.S. citizen in 1947 and was a Catholic and Democrat. O&#x27;Sullivan died in 1998 at the age of 87. She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and is remembered for her contributions to the art of film, including receiving the George Eastman Award in 1982.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Sullivan was born in Boyle, County Roscommon, Ireland, on 17 May 1911, the daughter of Mary Eva Lovatt (née Frazer; 1884–1969) and Charles Joseph O&#x27;Sullivan (1880–1974), an officer in the Connaught Rangers who served in World War I. Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan returned to Boyle in 1988 to be honoured by the town. 

As a child, O&#x27;Sullivan attended a convent school in Dublin, then the Convent of the Sacred Heart at Roehampton, England (now Woldingham School). One of her classmates there was Vivian Mary Hartley, the future Academy Award-winning actress Vivien Leigh. After attending finishing school in France, O&#x27;Sullivan returned to Dublin to work with the poor. 

In October 1929, she sailed to New York with her mother on the British steamer , on the way to Hollywood to work for the Fox Film Corporation.

==Film career==

O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s film career began when she met motion picture director Frank Borzage, who was doing location filming on &quot;Song o&#x27; My Heart&quot; (released in 1930) for Fox Film Corporation. He suggested she take a screen test which won her 
a part in the movie that starred Irish tenor John McCormack. She travelled to the United States to complete the movie in Hollywood. She appeared in six movies at Fox, then made three more at other studios.

In 1932 she signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. After several roles there and for other studios, she was chosen by Irving Thalberg to appear as Jane Parker in &quot;Tarzan the Ape Man&quot;, with costar Johnny Weissmuller. One of MGM&#x27;s more popular ingenues through the 1930s, she appeared in a number of other productions with various stars. She played Jane in six Tarzan features between 1932 and 1942.
She was featured with William Powell and Myrna Loy in &quot;The Thin Man&quot; (1934) and played Kitty in &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (1935) with Greta Garbo, Fredric March, and Basil Rathbone. After costarring with the Marx Brothers in &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; (1937), she appeared as Molly Beaumont in &quot;A Yank at Oxford&quot; (1938), written partly by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

She appeared in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1940) with Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson, and supported Ann Sothern in &quot;Maisie Was a Lady&quot; (1941). After appearing in &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s New York Adventure&quot; (1942), O&#x27;Sullivan asked MGM to release her from her contract so she could care for her husband, John Farrow, who had just left the Navy with typhoid. She retreated from show business, devoting her time to her family. In 1948, she reappeared on the screen in &quot;The Big Clock&quot;, directed by her husband for Paramount Pictures. She continued to appear occasionally in her husband&#x27;s movies and on television. 
By 1960, O&#x27;Sullivan believed she had permanently retired. However, actor Pat O&#x27;Brien encouraged her to take a part in summer stock, and the play &quot;A Roomful of Roses&quot; opened in 1961. It led to her Broadway debut in &quot;Never Too Late&quot; with costar Paul Ford. Shortly after it opened, John Farrow died of a heart attack. O&#x27;Sullivan stuck with acting after Farrow&#x27;s death; she was the Today Girl for NBC for a while, then made the movie version of &quot;Never Too Late&quot; (1965) for Warner Bros. She was also an executive director of a bridal consulting service, Wediquette International. 

In June and July 1972, O&#x27;Sullivan was in Denver, Colorado, to star in the Elitch Theatre production of &quot;Butterflies are Free&quot; with Karen Grassle and Brandon deWilde. The show ended on July 1, 1972.

When her daughter, actress Mia Farrow, became involved with Woody Allen both professionally and romantically, she appeared in Allen&#x27;s &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot;, playing Farrow&#x27;s mother. She had roles in &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; (1986) and the science fiction oddity &quot;Stranded&quot; (1987). In 1994, she appeared with Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers in &quot;Hart to Hart: Home Is Where the Hart Is&quot;, a feature-length made-for-TV movie with the wealthy husband-and-wife team from the popular weekly detective series &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;.

==Personal life==

O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s first husband was Australian-American writer, award-winning director and Catholic convert John Villiers Farrow, from September 12, 1936, until his death on January 27, 1963. She and Farrow had seven children: Michael Damien, Patrick Joseph (Patrick Villiers Farrow), Maria de Lourdes Villiers (Mia Farrow), John Charles, Prudence Farrow, Stephanie Farrow and Theresa Magdalena &quot;Tisa&quot; Farrow. Mia Farrow gave two of her children, Dylan and Ronan, the middle name of O&#x27;Sullivan.

In 1958, Michael Farrow, eldest son of John Farrow and Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan, died in a plane crash in California.

Twenty years after the death of Farrow, O&#x27;Sullivan married James Cushing, a wealthy businessman, on August 22, 1983, and they remained wed until her death in 1998. O&#x27;Sullivan became a U.S. citizen on October 22, 1947 (Petition for Naturalization #133033) in Los Angeles, California.

O&#x27;Sullivan was a Catholic, and as an ardent Democrat, she supported Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election.

==Death==

O&#x27;Sullivan died in Scottsdale, Arizona, of complications from heart surgery, on June 23, 1998, at age 87.

==Legacy==
O&#x27;Sullivan has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6541 Hollywood Boulevard, facing the star of Johnny Weissmuller. A black plaque marks her home on Main Street in Boyle, County Roscommon, Ireland. Just around the corner from there, opposite King House, is a tree, ceremonially planted by O&#x27;Sullivan to mark her return to her birthplace.

In 1982, O&#x27;Sullivan received the George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film.

<text>Rodolfo Graziani, 1st [[Marquis]] of Neghelli ( , ; 11 August 1882 – 11 January 1955), was an Italian military officer in the Kingdom of Italy&#x27;s Royal Army, primarily noted for his campaigns in Africa before and during World War II. A dedicated fascist and prominent member of the National Fascist Party, he was a key figure in the Italian military during the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini.

Graziani played an important role in the consolidation and expansion of the Italian colonial empire during the 1920s and 1930s, first in Libya and then in Ethiopia. He became infamous for harsh repressive measures, such as the use of concentration camps that caused many civilian deaths, and for extreme measures taken against the native resistance of the countries invaded by the Italian army, such as the hanging of Omar Mukhtar. Due to his brutal methods used in Libya, he was nicknamed &quot;Il macellaio del Fezzan&quot; (&quot;the butcher of Fezzan&quot;). In February 1937, after an assassination attempt against him during a ceremony in Addis Ababa, Graziani ordered a period of brutal retribution now known as Yekatit 12. Shortly after the Italy entered World War II, he returned to Libya as the commander of troops in Italian North Africa but resigned after the 1940–41 British offensive routed his forces; this campaign caused him other stress attacks, which he suffered from a snake accident during his military service in Libya a few years before World War I.

Following the fall of the Fascist regime in Italy in 1943, he was the only Marshal of Italy who remained loyal to Benito Mussolini and was named the Minister of Defence of the Italian Social Republic, commanding its army and returning to active service against the Allies for the rest of the war. Graziani was never prosecuted by the United Nations War Crimes Commission; he was included on its list of Italians eligible to be prosecuted for war crimes but Allied opposition and indifference to the prosecution of Italian war criminals frustrated Ethiopian attempts to bring him to justice. In 1950, an Italian court sentenced Graziani to 19 years of imprisonment for his collaboration with the Nazis; he was released after serving only four months. In the last years of his life, he went into politics, entering in the Italian Social Movement and becoming its Honorary President in 1953, probably for his career during the Fascist period in Italy, and died a few years later in 1955.

==Early life==
Rodolfo Graziani was born in Filettino in the province of Frosinone on August 11, 1882. His father, Filippo Graziani, was the village doctor. He was educated in a seminary in the town of Subiaco and then went on to study in the Liceo Torquato Tasso in Rome. Due to economic restraints, Graziani could not apply to the Military Academy of Modena and so decided to study law at university instead, at the urging of the father.

==Military career==
In 1903, he joined the Royal Italian Army as a reserve officer cadet whilst studying at university. In 1906, he passed a competitive examination for reserve officers to be made regular and became a second lieutenant, stationed at the 1st regiment of Grenadiers in Rome.
Graziani&#x27;s first posting was to Italian Eritrea where he learned Arabic and Tigrinya. In 1911, whilst in the Eritrean countryside, he was bitten by a snake which resulted in him being hospitalized. Because of this, he never served in the Italo-Turkish War. After his convalescence, he was repatriated to Italy where he was promoted to captain. In 1918, during World War I, Graziani in the &quot;Regio Esercito&quot; became the youngest &quot;Colonnello&quot; (Colonel) in Italian history.

===Libya===
In 1930, the Fascist government appointed Graziani Vice-Governor of Cyrenaica and commander of the Italian forces in Libya. He served there until 1934. During those four years, he suppressed the Senussi rebellion. In this so-called &quot;pacification&quot;, he was responsible for the construction of several concentration camps and labor camps, where thousands of Libyan prisoners died. Some prisoners were hanged, such as Omar Mukhtar, or shot, but most prisoners died of starvation or disease. His deeds earned him the nickname &quot;the Butcher of Fezzan&quot; among the Arabs. Fascist propaganda, however, called him the Pacifier of Libya (&quot;Pacificatore della Libia&quot;).

In 1935, Graziani was appointed Governor of Italian Somaliland.

===Ethiopia===

During the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in 1935 and 1936, Graziani was the commander of the southern front. His army invaded Ethiopia from Italian Somaliland and he commanded the Italian forces at the battles of Genale Doria and the Ogaden. However, Graziani&#x27;s efforts in the south were secondary to the main invasion launched from Eritrea by &quot;Generale&quot; Emilio De Bono, later continued by Marshal of Italy Pietro Badoglio. It was Badoglio and not Graziani who entered Addis Ababa in triumph after his &quot;March of the Iron Will&quot;. But it was Graziani who said: &quot;The &quot;Duce&quot; will have Ethiopia, with or without the Ethiopians.&quot;

Addis Ababa fell to Badoglio on 5 May 1936. Graziani had wanted to reach Harar before Badoglio reached Addis Ababa, but failed to do so. Even so, on 9 May, Graziani was rewarded for his role as commander of the southern front with a promotion to the rank of Marshal of Italy. During his tour of an Ethiopian Orthodox church in Dire Dawa, Graziani fell into a pit covered by an ornate carpet, a trap that he believed had been set by the Ethiopian priests to injure or kill him. As a result, he held Ethiopian clerics in deep suspicion.

After the war, Graziani was made Viceroy of Italian East Africa and Governor-General of Shewa / Addis Ababa. After an unsuccessful attempt by two Eritreans to kill him on 19 February 1937 (and after murders of other Italians in occupied Ethiopia), Graziani ordered a bloody and indiscriminate reprisal upon the conquered country, later remembered by Ethiopians as &quot;Yekatit 12&quot;. Up to thirty thousand civilians of Addis Ababa were killed indiscriminately; another 1,469 were summarily executed by the end of the next month, and over one thousand Ethiopian notables were imprisoned and then exiled from Ethiopia. Graziani became known as &quot;the Butcher of Ethiopia&quot;. In connection with the attempt on his life, Graziani authorized the massacre of the monks of the ancient monastery of Debre Libanos and a large number of pilgrims, who had traveled there to celebrate the feast day of the founding saint of the monastery. Graziani&#x27;s suspicion of the Ethiopian Orthodox clergy (and the fact that the wife of one of the assassins had briefly taken sanctuary at the monastery) had convinced him of the monks&#x27; complicity in the attempt on his life.

From 1939 to 1941, Graziani was Chief of Staff of the &quot;Regio Esercito&quot;.

==World War II==
At the start of World War II, Graziani, now styled 1st Marquis of Neghelli, was still Commander-in-Chief of the &quot;Regio Esercito&quot;″s General Staff. Graziani oversaw the Italian forces during the Italian invasion of France on June 1940. After the death of Marshal Italo Balbo in a friendly fire incident on 28 June 1940, Graziani took his place as Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of Italian North Africa.

The Italian dictator Benito Mussolini had given Graziani a deadline of 8 August 1940 to invade Egypt with the 10th Army. Graziani doubted the ability of his largely-unmechanized force to defeat the British and put off the invasion for as long as he could.

However, faced with demotion, Graziani ultimately followed orders, and four divisions of the 10th Army invaded Egypt on 9 September against the British screening forces. The Italians captured Sidi Barrani and then prepared a series of fortified camps to defend their positions. In December 1940, in Operation Compass the British counterattacked and completely defeated the 10th Army. On 25 March 1941, Graziani was replaced by General Italo Gariboldi. Graziani remained mostly inactive for the next two years. During his time in Italy, he played a role in suppressing the Italian anti-fascist movement.

Graziani was the only Italian Marshal to remain loyal to Mussolini after the fall of the Fascist regime in Italy, and he joined Mussolini in the north after the Italian surrender (some say that he chose to adhere to the Italian Social Republic for his dislike for Pietro Badoglio, who had signed the Armistice of Cassibile with the Allies and because he was his worst enemy during the fascist period). He was appointed Minister of Defence of the Italian Social Republic by Mussolini and oversaw the mixed Italo-German Army Group Liguria (&quot;Armee Ligurien&quot;). Graziani defeated Allied forces in the December 1944 &quot;Battle of Garfagnana&quot; and led a joint Italian-German force that included the Italian 2nd Grenadier Division &#x27;Littorio&#x27;, 3rd Marine Division &#x27;San Marco&#x27; and the 4th Alpine Division &#x27;Monte Rosa&#x27; , the ENR divisions that trained are from Germany.

When Mussolini fled northward on 25 April 1945, Graziani was left as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of what remained of the Italian Social Republic. Mussolini was captured and executed on 28 April 1945. In the following day Axis troops in northern Italy surrendered. Graziani sent a delegation to surrender all RSI troops. On 30 April, he surrendered to the US IV Corps, and on 1 May, he ordered the Army Group Liguria under his command to surrender.

At the end of World War II, Graziani spent a few days in the San Vittore Prison in Milan before he was transferred to Allied control. He was brought back to Africa in Anglo-American custody and stayed there until February 1946. Allied forces then felt the danger of his assassination or lynching had passed (many thousands of fascists were murdered in Italy in the summer and autumn of 1945) and so moved Graziani to the Procida prison in Italy.

==War crimes and indictments==

Before the Second World War, the League of Nations did not prosecute Graziani and the Italian authorities for war crimes in Ethiopia. In one case, Graziani had ordered his troops to use chemical weapons against Nasibu Zeamanuel&#x27;s troops in Gorrahei on 10 October 1935. Although the Ethiopian Minister of Foreign Affairs gave the League of Nations irrefutable evidence of what the Italian military had done from within a few hours of its invasion on 3 October 1935 to 10 April of the following year, no action was taken. Incidents included the use of poison gas and the bombing of Red Cross hospitals and ambulances.

In 1943, the United States proposed to the Allies replacing the League of Nations with a new body, the United Nations. The United Nations War Crimes Commission was created to investigate allegations of war crimes committed by Axis powers in World War II. On 31 December 1946, Ambaye Wolde Mariam from The Ethiopian War Crimes Commission presented to the UN War Crimes Commission its preliminary findings against Graziani. This related, however, to the period before WWII. The Ethiopian government felt it would have no difficulty from the sufficient amount of evidence it had to justify a trial against Graziani, especially for the massacres he ordered in February 1937. On 4 March 1948, charges against Graziani were presented to the United Nations War Crimes Commission. The commission was presented with evidence of the Italian policy of systematic terrorism and Graziani&#x27;s self-admitted intention to execute all Amharas authorities and cited a telegram from Graziani to General Nasi, in which Graziani had written, &quot;Keep in mind also that I have already aimed at the total destruction of Abyssinian chiefs and notables and that this should be carried out completely in your territories&quot;. The UN Commission agreed that there was a prima facie case against eight Italians, including Graziani.
However, the Allies questioned the veracity of Ethiopia&#x27;s claim against the Italians on the grounds that it was impossible to identify which individuals in the Italian military hierarchy had actually issued the criminal orders. The British government was the firmest supporter of that stance, and the United States pursued a policy &quot;largely characterized by ambivalence towards Italian aggression&quot;. The Ethiopian government made a direct request to the &quot;Four Policemen&quot;, but that was immediately rejected on technical grounds. In addition, many in the Italian press firmly opposed any Italian officer being put on trial for war crimes. Faced with such resistance and indifference, Ethiopia had no choice but to back down from their requests, to the consternation of many Ethiopians.

In 1950, an Italian military tribunal sentenced Graziani to 19 years in jail for collaborating with the Nazis, but he was released after only four months because his lawyers demonstrated that his actions had been only after he &quot;received orders&quot;. He never faced any further prosecutions for any other specific war crimes. Unlike the Germans and the Japanese, the Italians did not have their commanders subjected to prosecutions by Allied tribunals.

In the early 1950s, Graziani had some involvement with the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI), and he became the &quot;Honorary President&quot; of the party in 1953. Though the MSI saw Graziani as a figurehead, they also believed politically he could not be trusted as he had too often refused to obey the party’s directives. He would later explain his motivations for joining the group:‘I joined the MSI because it mirrors my beliefs and convictions. However, it would be absurd to think that a new Fascist dictatorship could be set up today. History teaches us that dictatorships don’t spring up like mushrooms.&#x27;

During the summer of 1954, Graziani resigned from the MSI.

==Death==
By autumn 1954, Graziani was losing strength and he began experiencing mounting health issues. His mental health had deteriorated to the point that he sometimes woke up thinking he was still imperial viceroy in Addis Ababa. By years end he was suffering from acute pain and on 26 December 1954, he underwent surgery. It went well and he began recovering during the first week of January 1955. On 10 January, his health suddenly rapidly declined. At midnight he went into a coma, briefly regaining consciousness at 4 am and stated his later words, ‘If my time has come, I’ll go calmly to be judged by God’. He died in Rome at 6 am on 11 January 1955 at the age of 72.

More than 100,000 people came to his funeral in front of the church of Saint Bellarmino in Rome. Crowds holding banners, singing hymns and giving fascist salutes packed the streets.

===Mausoleum controversy===
In August 2012, $160,000 of public money was used to help finance the building of a large monument atop Graziani&#x27;s tomb in Affile. The subscription was supplemented by private funding from the mayor of Affile, Ercole Viri. The new mausoleum was engraved with the words &quot;Fatherland&quot; and &quot;Honor&quot;. Local left-wing politicians and national commentators harshly criticized the monument whereas the town&#x27;s &quot;mostly conservative&quot; population approved. Public funding for the Graziani monument was suspended by the newly elected Lazio administration after the 2013 regional elections. A statement from Ethiopia&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Graziani did not deserve to be memorialized but instead be condemned in history for his war crimes, genocidal behavior and crimes against humanity. In 2017, Viri and two other Affile town councillors were convicted of the crime of &quot;fascism apology&quot; for building the monument and were given jail sentences, although the court did not order the removal of the monument.

==In popular culture==

Graziani was portrayed by British actor Oliver Reed in the 1981 war film &quot;Lion of the Desert&quot;. On its release, it was banned by the Italian government because, in the words of Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, it was &quot;damaging to the honor of the army&quot;.

Graziani was also portrayed by Rodolfo Dal Pra in the Italian film &quot;Last Days of Mussolini&quot;.

The Italian singer and composer Franco Battiato included a reference to Graziani in his song &quot;Lettera al Governatore della Libia&quot; (Letter to the governor of Libya) with the phrase &quot;Lo sai che quell&#x27;idiota di Graziani farà una brutta fine&quot; (You know that the idiotic Graziani will have a bad end).

She twice won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress, for &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; in 1971 and in 1976 for &quot;Edward the Seventh&quot;. 

Also in 1976, she was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for the 1976 film &quot;The Slipper and the Rose&quot; and she won the award for Best Actress at the Evening Standard British Film Awards for the same role.

==Early life and career==
Crosbie was born in Gorebridge, Midlothian, Scotland, as Annette Ross Mcleod Crosbie to Presbyterian parents who disapproved of her becoming an actress. Nevertheless, she joined the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School while still in her teens. She began her career with the Glasgow Citizens&#x27; Theatre Company in 1956. She was educated at Boroughmuir High School in Edinburgh. Her big break came in 1970 when she was cast as Catherine of Aragon in the BBC television series &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot;, for which she won the 1971 BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress. In 1973, she starred alongside Vanessa Redgrave in the BBC serial &quot;A Picture of Katherine Mansfield&quot;.

In 1975, Crosbie made a similar impact as another queen, Queen Victoria, in the ITV period drama &quot;Edward the Seventh&quot;, for which she won the 1976 BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress. She played Cinderella&#x27;s fairy godmother in &quot;The Slipper and the Rose&quot;, which was chosen as the Royal Film Première for 1976. In that film, Crosbie sang the Sherman Brothers&#x27; song, &quot;Suddenly It Happens&quot;.

She also played Janet, the housekeeper to &quot;Dr. Finlay&quot;, in the 1993–96 revival of A. J. Cronin&#x27;s popular stories. She also had a poignant role in the thriller &quot;The Debt Collector&quot; (1999).

<doc id="202128" wikidata="Q693675" url="?curid=202128" title="The Musical Offering">
<text>The Musical Offering (German: or ), BWV 1079, is a collection of keyboard canons and fugues and other pieces of music by Johann Sebastian Bach, all based on a single musical theme given to him by Frederick the Great (King Frederick II of Prussia), to whom they are dedicated. They were published in September 1747. The &quot;Ricercar a 6&quot;, a six-voice fugue which is regarded as the high point of the entire work, was put forward by the musicologist Charles Rosen as the most significant piano composition in history (partly because it is one of the first). This ricercar is also occasionally called the Prussian Fugue, a name used by Bach himself.

==History==

The collection has its roots in a meeting between Bach and Frederick II on May 7, 1747. The meeting, taking place at the king&#x27;s residence in Potsdam, came about because Bach&#x27;s son Carl Philipp Emanuel was employed there as court musician. Frederick wanted to show the elder Bach a novelty, the fortepiano, which had been invented 47 years earlier but had not yet gained wide acceptance (Bach did not encounter them until around 1736). The king, however, owned several of the experimental instruments being developed by Gottfried Silbermann. During his anticipated visit to Frederick&#x27;s palace in Potsdam, Bach, who was well known for his skill at improvising, received from Frederick a long and complex musical theme on which to improvise a three-voice fugue. He did so, but Frederick then challenged him to improvise a six-voice fugue on the same theme. Bach answered that he would need to work the score and send it to the king afterwards. Bach instead chose a different theme and, again completely extempore, executed a six-voice fugue on it with the same virtuosity as he had done the three-voice one, greatly impressing all in attendance. He later returned to Leipzig to write out the &quot;Thema Regium&quot; (&quot;theme of the king&quot;):

&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&#x27;{
 \clef treble
 \key c \minor
 \time 2/2
 \set Staff.midiInstrument = &quot;harpsichord&quot;

 e ees~ | % 5
 ees4 d des c | % 6
 b a8 g c4 f | % 7
 ees2 d \bar &quot;|&quot; | % 8
 c4
}&lt;/score&gt;
Four months after the meeting, Bach published a set of pieces based on this theme which we now know as &quot;The Musical Offering&quot;. Bach inscribed the piece &quot;Regis Iussu Cantio Et Reliqua Canonica Arte Resoluta&quot; (the theme given by the king, with additions, resolved in the canonic style), the first letters of which spell out the word &quot;ricercar&quot;, a well-known genre of the time.

===Possible origin of the King&#x27;s Theme===

Humphrey F. Sassoon has compared the theme issued by Frederick II to the theme of an A minor fugue (HWV 609) by George Frideric Handel, published in &quot;Six fugues or voluntarys for organ or harpsichord&quot;. Sassoon notes that &quot;Handel&#x27;s theme is much shorter than the King&#x27;s, but its musical &#x27;architecture&#x27; is uncannily similar: jumps followed by a descending chromatic scale.&quot; He also elaborates on their additional similarities, which led Sassoon to suggest that Bach used Handel&#x27;s A minor fugue as a structural model or guide for the &quot;Musical Offering&quot;&#x27;s Ricercar a 6, and that its musical concepts may also have influenced Bach&#x27;s development of the Ricercar a 3. Nevertheless, the Ricercar a 6 is longer and incomparably more complex than Handel&#x27;s fugue.

Arnold Schoenberg, in his 1950 essay on Bach, suggested that the &quot;Thema Regium&quot; was created by Bach&#x27;s son Carl Phillip Emanuel on the orders of the king, as a well-prepared trap to embarrass J. S. Bach.

== Structure and instrumentation ==
In its finished form, &quot;The Musical Offering&quot; comprises:
*Two Ricercars, written down on as many staves as there are voices:
** a Ricercar a 3 (a three-voice fugue)
** a Ricercar a 6 (a six-voice fugue)
*Ten Canons:
**Canones diversi super Thema Regium:
***2 Canons a 2 (the first representing a notable example of a crab canon or &quot;canon cancrizans&quot;)
***Canon a 2, per motum contrarium
***Canon a 2, per augmentationem, contrario motu
***Canon a 2, per tonos
**Canon perpetuus
**Fuga canonica in Epidiapente
**Canon a 2 &quot;Quaerendo invenietis&quot;
**Canon a 4
**Canon perpetuus, contrario motu

*A Sonata sopr&#x27;il Soggetto Reale – a trio sonata featuring the flute, an instrument which Frederick played, consisting of four movements:
**Largo
**Allegro
**Andante
**Allegro

Apart from the trio sonata, which is written for flute, violin and basso continuo, the pieces have few indications of which instruments are meant to play them, although there is now significant support for the idea that they are for solo keyboard, like most of Bach&#x27;s other published works.

The ricercars and canons have been realised in various ways. The ricercars are more frequently performed on keyboard than the canons, which are often played by an ensemble of chamber musicians, with instrumentation comparable to that of the trio sonata.

As the printed version gives the impression of being organised for convenient page turning when sight-playing the score, the order of the pieces intended by Bach (&quot;if&quot; there was an intended order) remains uncertain, although it is customary to open the collection with the &quot;Ricercar a 3&quot;, and play the trio sonata toward the end. The &quot;Canones super Thema Regium&quot; are also usually played together.

===Musical riddles===
Some of the canons of &quot;The Musical Offering&quot; are represented in the original score by no more than a short monodic melody of a few measures, with a more or less enigmatic inscription in Latin above the melody. These compositions are called the riddle fugues (or sometimes, more appropriately, the &quot;riddle canons&quot;). The performer(s) is/are supposed to interpret the music as a multi-part piece (a piece with several intertwining melodies), while solving the &quot;riddle&quot;. Some of these riddles have been explained to have more than one possible &quot;solution&quot;, although nowadays most printed editions of the score give a single, more or less &quot;standard&quot; solution of the riddle, so that interpreters can just play, without having to worry about the Latin, or the riddle.

One of these &quot;riddle canons&quot;, &quot;in augmentationem&quot; (i.e. augmentation, the length of the notes gets longer), is inscribed &quot;Notulis crescentibus crescat Fortuna Regis&quot; (may the fortunes of the king increase like the length of the notes), while a modulating canon which ends a tone higher than it starts is inscribed &quot;Ascendenteque Modulatione ascendat Gloria Regis&quot; (as the modulation rises, so may the king&#x27;s glory).

===Canon per tonos (endlessly rising canon)===

The canon per tonos (endlessly rising canon) pits a variant of the king&#x27;s theme against a two-voice canon at the fifth. However, it modulates and finishes one whole tone higher than it started out at. It thus has no final cadence.

==Theological character==
Among the theories about external sources of influence, Michael Marissen draws attention to the possibility of theological connotations. Marissen sees an incongruity between the official dedication to Frederick the Great and the effect of the music, which is often melancholy, even mournful. The trio sonata is a contrapuntal &quot;sonata da chiesa&quot;, whose style was at odds with Frederick’s secular tastes. The inscription &quot;Quaerendo invenietis&quot;, found over Canon No. 9, alludes to the Sermon on the Mount (“Seek and ye shall find”, Matthew 7:7, Luke 11:9). The main title, &quot;Opfer&quot; (“offering”), makes it possible for the cycle to be viewed as an Offertory in the religious sense of the word. Marissen also points out that, canonic procedures often evoking the rigorous demands of the Mosaic Law, the ten canons likely allude to the Ten Commandments. Marissen believes that Bach was trying to evangelize Frederick the Great, pointing him to the demands of the Mosaic Law.

In a recent study Zoltán Göncz has pointed out, the authorial injunction to seek (Quaerendo invenietis) does not only relate to the riddle canons but to the six-part &quot;ricercar&quot; as well, whose archaic title also means to &quot;seek&quot;. There are several Biblical citations hidden in this movement, and their discovery is made especially difficult by various compositional maneuvers. The unique formal structure of the fugue provides a clue: certain anomalies and apparent inconsistencies point to external, nonmusical influences.

Among Bach&#x27;s duties during his tenure at Leipzig (1723–50), was teaching Latin. Ursula Kirkendale argued for a close connection with the twelve-volume rhetorical manual &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot; of the Roman orator Quintilian, whom Frederick the Great admired. Philologist and Rector of the Leipzig Thomasschule, Johann Matthias Gesner, for whom Bach composed a cantata in 1729, published a substantial Quintilian edition with a long footnote in Bach&#x27;s honor.

==Adaptations and citations==
The &quot;thema regium&quot; appears as the theme for the first and last movements of Sonata No. 7 in D minor by Friedrich Wilhelm Rust, written in about 1788, and also as the theme for elaborate variations by Giovanni Paisiello in his &quot;Les Adieux de la Grande Duchesse de Russies,&quot; written in about 1784, upon his departure from the court of Catherine the Great.

The &quot;Ricercar a 6&quot; has been arranged on its own on a number of occasions, the most prominent arranger being Anton Webern, who in 1935 made a version for small orchestra, noted for its Klangfarbenmelodie style (i.e. melody lines are passed on from one instrument to another after every few notes, every note receiving the &quot;tone color&quot; of the instrument it is played on):


Webern&#x27;s arrangement was dedicated to the BBC music producer and conductor Edward Clark.

Another version of the &quot;Ricercare a 6 voci&quot; was published in 1942 by C. F. Peters in an arrangement for organ by the musicologist Hermann Keller, then based in Stuttgart.

Igor Markevitch produced a realization for three orchestral groups and, for the sonata movements, solo quartet (violin, flute, cello, and harpsichord), written in 1949–50.

The Modern Jazz Quartet used one of the canons (originally &quot;for two violins at the unison&quot;) as an introduction to their performance of the standard song &quot;Softly, as in a Morning Sunrise&quot;, on their album &quot;Concorde&quot; (1955). The Royal Theme is played on the double bass, with Milt Jackson (vibraphone) and John Lewis (piano) weaving the two imitative contrapuntal voices above:
Isang Yun composed Königliches Thema for Solo Violin, a passacaglia on the Thema Regium with Asian and Twelve-tone influences, written in 1970.

Bart Berman composed three new canons on the Royal Theme of &quot;The Musical Offering&quot;, which were published in 1978 as a special holiday supplement to the Dutch music journal &quot;Mens &amp; Melodie&quot; (publisher: Het Spectrum).

Sofia Gubaidulina used the Royal Theme of &quot;The Musical Offering&quot; in her violin concerto &quot;Offertorium&quot; (1980). Orchestrated in an arrangement similar to Webern&#x27;s, the theme is deconstructed note by note through a series of variations and reconstructed as a Russian Orthodox hymn.

Leslie Howard produced a new realisation of &quot;The Musical Offering&quot;, which he orchestrated and conducted in Finland in 1990.

The organist Jean Guillou transcribed the entire work for organ in 2005.

<doc id="202132" wikidata="Q1149325" url="?curid=202132" title="Seven Years in Tibet">
<text>Seven Years in Tibet: My Life Before, During and After (1952; (&quot;Seven years in Tibet. My life at the court of the Dalai Lama&quot;); 1954 in English) is an autobiographical travel book written by Austrian mountaineer and Nazi SS sergeant Heinrich Harrer based on his real life experiences in Tibet between 1944 and 1951 during the Second World War and the interim period before the Communist Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army began the Battle of Chamdo in 1950 when the Chinese attempted to reestablish control over Tibet.

==Plot==

The book covers the escape of Harrer and his companion, Peter Aufschnaiter, from a British prisoner-of-war camp in India. Harrer and Aufschnaiter then traveled across Tibet to Lhasa, the capital. Here they spent several years, and Harrer describes the contemporary Tibetan culture in detail. Harrer subsequently became a tutor and friend of the 14th Dalai Lama.

It has been said that the book &quot;provided the world with a final glimpse of life in an independent Tibetan state prior to the Chinese invasion.&quot;

==Criticism==

While Heinrich Harrer held the rank of a Nazi sergeant in the SS, he was a world renowned mountaineer and on expedition in the Indian Himalayas when he and his group were arrested by British colonial authorities after the outbreak of World War II. With his escape to Tibet (where he stayed until 1951) he never saw active combat. 

After his Nazi affiliation was revealed by the German magazine Stern in 1997, he expressed regret for his involvement with the Party.

The book has been criticized by Marxist political scientist Michael Parenti for its whitewashing portrayal of Tibet before the involvement of the Chinese Communist Party. Parenti rebukes Harrer&#x27;s sanitized portrayal of Tibet and instead describes it as a feudal society consisting of slavery, lifelong servitude, and serfdom before being liberated by the PLA.

==Publication==
&quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; was translated into 53 languages, became a bestseller in the United States in 1954, and sold three million copies.

At the beginning of the Flamingo edition of the book, a message from the 14th Dalai Lama praises the work: &quot;Harrer has always been such a friend to Tibet. His most important contribution to our cause, his book, &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot;, introduced hundreds of thousands of people to my country.&quot; When Harrer died in 2006, the Dalai Lama repeated his praise of the author and sent a message of sympathy to Harrer&#x27;s widow.

==Pop culture==
Two films have been based on the book: &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; (1956), a 76-minute documentary directed by Hans Nieter which includes both movies shot by Harrer during his stay in Tibet and various scenes from his adventures reconstructed by Harrer himself, and &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; (1997), directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud and starring Brad Pitt as Harrer and David Thewlis as Aufschnaiter.

There is also a David Bowie song entitled &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot;, from his album &quot;Earthling&quot; (1997). Bowie read the book when he was 19 and it left a strong impression on him at the time.

<text>The Rules of the Game (original French title: La règle du jeu) is a 1939 French satirical comedy-drama film directed by Jean Renoir. The ensemble cast includes Nora Gregor, Paulette Dubost, Mila Parély, Marcel Dalio, Julien Carette, Roland Toutain, Gaston Modot, Pierre Magnier and Renoir.

Renoir&#x27;s portrayal of the wise, mournful Octave anchors the fatalistic mood of this pensive comedy of manners. The film depicts members of upper-class French society and their servants just before the beginning of World War II, showing their moral callousness on the eve of destruction.

At the time, &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; was the most expensive French film made: Its original budget of 2.5 million francs eventually increased to more than 5 million francs. Renoir and cinematographer Jean Bachelet made extensive use of deep-focus and long shots during which the camera is constantly moving, sophisticated cinematic techniques in 1939.

Renoir&#x27;s career in France was at its pinnacle in 1939 and &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; was eagerly anticipated. However, its premiere was met with scorn and disapproval by critics and audiences. Renoir reduced the film&#x27;s running time from 113 minutes to 85, but even then, the film was a critical and financial disaster. In October 1939, it was banned by the wartime French government for &quot;having an undesirable influence over the young&quot;.

For many years, the 85-minute version was the only one available; even so, its reputation slowly grew. However, in 1956, boxes of original material were discovered, and a reconstructed version of the film premiered that year at the Venice Film Festival, with only a minor scene from Renoir&#x27;s first cut missing. Since then, &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; has been called one of the greatest films in the history of cinema. Numerous film critics and directors have praised it highly, citing it as an inspiration for their own work. It is the only film to earn a place among the top ten films in the respected Sight &amp; Sound (British Film Institute) decennial critics&#x27; poll for every decade from the poll&#x27;s inception in 1952 through the 2012 list (in 2022 it fell to #13).

== Plot ==

Aviator André Jurieux lands at Le Bourget Airfield outside Paris after crossing the Atlantic in his plane. He is greeted by his friend Octave, who tells André that Christine the Austrian-French noblewoman André loveshas not come to greet him. André is heartbroken. When a radio reporter comes to broadcast André&#x27;s first words upon landing, he explains his sorrow and denounces Christine. She is listening to the broadcast in her Paris apartment while attended by her maid, Lisette. Christine has been married to Robert, Marquis de la Chesnaye for three years. For two years, Lisette has been married to Schumacher the gamekeeper at Robert&#x27;s country estate, La Colinière in Solognebut she is more devoted to Christine than to her husband. Christine&#x27;s past relationship with André is openly known by her husband, her maid and their friend Octave. After Christine and Robert playfully discuss André&#x27;s emotional display and pledge devotion to one another, Robert excuses himself to make a telephone call. He arranges to meet his mistress Geneviève the next morning.

At Geneviève&#x27;s apartment, Robert says he must end their relationship but invites her to join them for a weekend retreat to La Colinière. Christine also invites her niece, Jackie. Later, Octave induces Robert to invite André to the estate as well. They joke that André and Geneviève will begin a relationship, thereby solving everyone&#x27;s problems. At the estate, Schumacher is policing the grounds and trying to eliminate rabbits. Marceau a poachersneaks onto the estate to retrieve a rabbit caught in a snare. Before Marceau can escape, Schumacher catches him and begins to escort him from the property when Robert demands to know what is happening. Marceau explains that he can catch rabbits and Robert hires him as a servant. Once inside the house, Marceau flirts with Lisette. The assembled guests go on a hunt led by Schumacher, who resents Marceau. On the way back to La Colinière&#x27;s castle, Robert tells Geneviève that he no longer loves her. Geneviève wants to pack up and leave but Christine persuades her to stay.

At a masked ball, various romantic liaisons are made. André and Christine declare their love for each other and plan to run away together. Marceau pursues Lisette, and the jealous Schumacher is upset. Robert and André come to an argument over Christine. In the secluded greenhouse, Octave declares that he too loves Christinewho is now having doubts about Andréand they decide to run away together. Schumacher and Marceau, who have both been expelled from the estate by Robert after a fight over Lisette, watch Octave and Christine in the greenhouse. As in Beaumarchais&#x27;s &quot;Marriage of Figaro,&quot; the literary basis for Mozart&#x27;s opera, they mistake Christine for Lisette because Christine is wearing Lisette&#x27;s cape and hood. Octave returns to the house for his coat and hat, where Lisette begs him not to leave with Christine.

Breaking his promise to Christine, Octave meets André and sends him out to Christine in the greenhouse, lending him his overcoat. When André reaches the greenhouse wearing Octave&#x27;s coat, Schumacher mistakes him for Octave, whom he thinks is trying to run off with his wife Lisette, and Schumacher shoots him dead.

In the closing moments of the film, Octave and Marceau walk away into the night as Robert brings Schumacher back into the household and explains that he would report the killing to the authorities as nothing more than an unfortunate accident.

== Production ==

=== Background and writing ===
In 1938 the French film industry was booming, and Renoir was at the height of his career. He had had three consecutive hit films and &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; had won awards from the New York Film Critics, the National Board of Review and the Venice Film Festival. The financial success of &quot;La Bête Humaine&quot; made it easy for Renoir to secure enough financial backing to form his own production company. In 1938 he founded Nouvelle Édition Française (NEF) with his brother Pierre Renoir, together with André Zwoboda, Oliver Billiou and Camille François. All five invested 10,000 francs into the company and intended to produce two films per year. The company was modeled after the American film production company United Artists, which was formed in 1919 as a film distribution company for independent artists by Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, D.W. Griffith and Mary Pickford. Renoir rallied his friends in the film industry around the company and got financial support from René Clair, Julien Duvivier, Jean Gabin and Simone Simon. NEF&#x27;s headquarters on the Rue la Grange-Batelière was sublet from Marcel Pagnol&#x27;s production company. On 8 December 1938 Georges Cravenne published a press release in &quot;Paris-Soir&quot; announcing that Renoir and Pagnol were about to sign an agreement to procure a large theatre where they would publicly screen &quot;the films that they would direct from then on&quot;. &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; was the only film produced by the company.

In May 1938, Renoir completed the historical drama &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; and wanted to make a comedy. He was anxious about the Munich agreement and the strong possibility of another world war, and wanted to film a &quot;happy dream&quot; to subdue his pessimism. He wrote a synopsis for a film titled &quot;Les Millions d&#x27;Arlequin&quot;, which had characters similar to those in &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot;. When conceiving the film, Renoir was inspired by classical French art, such as the works of Pierre de Marivaux, Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais and especially Alfred de Musset&#x27;s play &quot;Les Caprices de Marianne&quot;, which Renoir initially intended to adapt; NEF first announced the film as an adaptation of it. Renoir later said he never intended to directly adapt &quot;Les Caprices de Marianne&quot; but only to re-read it and other classics of French literature for inspiration.

After returning from lecturing in London in January 1939, Renoir left Paris to work on a script. He told a reporter that his next film would be &quot;A precise description of the bourgeois of our age.&quot; Renoir, Carl Koch and Zwoboda went to Marlotte to work on the script. Because Renoir wanted to allow the actors to improvise their dialogue, only one-third of the film was scripted and the rest was a detailed outline. Renoir later said that his &quot;ambition when I made the film was to illustrate this remark: we are dancing on a volcano&quot;. Renoir called the film a &quot;divertissement&quot; for its use of baroque music and aspects of classical French comedies. Renoir&#x27;s initial inspiration by &quot;Les Caprices de Marianne&quot; led to the film&#x27;s four main characters correlating with those of the play; a virtuous wife, a jealous husband, a despairing lover and an interceding friend. In both the play and the film the interceding friend is named Octave. Octave is also the only one of the four characters inspired by the play that shares traits with its counterpart. In both works, Octave is a &quot;sad clown&quot; full of self-doubt and self-pity. The characters&#x27; names constantly changed between versions of the script; Renoir said that in an early draft, André Jurieux was an orchestra conductor rather than an aviator.

=== Casting ===
Renoir originally wanted the entire cast of &quot;La bête humaine&quot;including Fernand Ledoux, Simone Simon, Jean Gabin and Julien Carettefor the film. Gabin was offered the role of André but rejected it and accepted a role in Marcel Carné&#x27;s &quot;Le jour se lève&quot; instead. He was replaced by Roland Toutain. Simon was offered the role of Christine but wanted 800,000 francs, which was a third of the film&#x27;s entire budget. Simon&#x27;s salary request was vetoed by NEF administrator Camille François. Ledoux was offered the role of Schumacher. He was married to Simon at the time; he declined when her salary request was denied and instead took a role in Maurice Tourneur&#x27;s &quot;Volpone&quot;. He was replaced by Gaston Modot. Claude Dauphin was offered the role of the Marquis de la Chesnaye; he refused it and instead acted with Simon in Raymond Bernard&#x27;s &quot;Cavalcade d&#x27;amour&quot;. Renoir then cast Marcel Dalio as the Marquis. Years later, Dalio asked Renoir why he had been cast after having typically played burlesque or traitorous roles. Renoir told Dalio that he was the opposite of the cliché of what a Marquis was and that Dalio was the only actor he knew that could portray the character&#x27;s insecurity. Renoir&#x27;s brother Pierre was cast as Octave, and Carette was cast as Marceau.

François suggested newly famous stage actress Michele Alfa for the role of Christine, and Renoir went with his common-law wife Marguerite and Zwoboda to see her perform in a play. While at the play Renoir noticed Nora Gregor in a box seat in the audience and asked about her during the intermission. He learned that Gregor was the wife of Prince Ernst Rüdiger von Starhemberg, an Austrian nobleman. Renoir became friends with Gregor and her husband, getting to know them over several dinners in Paris. Starhemberg was forced to resign his leadership role in the Heimwehra paramilitary fascist partybecause Gregor was Jewish and he was anti-fascist. When Germany annexed Austria in March 1938 Gregor and Starhemberg fled to France. Renoir said they were &quot;in a state of great disarray. Everything they believed in was collapsing.&quot; Gregor was an actress from the Viennese &quot;Burgtheater&quot; and had appeared in some films, including Carl Theodor Dreyer&#x27;s &quot;Michael&quot;. Gregor&#x27;s first husband had been the concert pianist Mitja Nikisch, son of the renowned conductor Arthur Nikisch of the Leipzig Opera and according to film theorist Charles Drazin, a possible inspiration for some characteristics of Octave.

Despite objections from his NEF colleagues, Renoir hired Gregor for the role of Christine. She was older than the original character, and he made changes to the character based on Gregor&#x27;s personality and on their dinner conversations, such as making Christine the daughter of an Austrian conductor. Many of Renoir&#x27;s friends believed he fell in love with Gregor shortly after casting her. Zwoboda said Gregor had &quot;that which Renoir loved above all; an incontestable class, a style, the gestures and bearing of a great distinction&quot;. Renoir said he cast Gregor because of her Austrian accent, which he believed would create &quot;a little barrier ... between her and her surroundings&quot; and because of her appearance, which he considered &quot;birdlike&quot; and &quot;sincere&quot;.

Renoir finished casting the remaining roles by late January 1939. When asked who the main character of the film was, Renoir answered: &quot;There isn&#x27;t any! My conception at the beginningand at the endwas to make a &quot;film d&#x27;ensemble&quot;, a film representing a society, a group of persons, almost a whole class, and not a film of personal affairs.&quot;

=== Filming ===
Filming for exterior scenes set in the country began on 15 February 1939, in Sologne and outside the Chateau de la Ferté-Saint-Aubin. Renoir later said he chose Sologne because his father Pierre-Auguste Renoir &quot;regretted that he had never been able to paint [it]. How well I understand the sincerity of those regrets before these beautiful landscapes of Sologne, in astonishing colors, of a grace so melancholy yet so gentle.&quot; Renoir said Sologne&#x27;s mist &quot;took me back to the happy days of my childhood.&quot;

The cast and crew arrived in Sologne between 6 and 15 February. Renoir&#x27;s son Alain worked as an assistant camera operator and Dido Freire worked as the script girl. Renoir&#x27;s assistants on the film were Koch, Zwoboda and Henri Cartier-Bresson. Tony Corteggiani was hired as a technical advisor for the rabbit hunting sequence. The cast and crew stayed at Hotel Rat in Lamotte-Beuvron. Heavy rainfall prevented the start of shooting in Sologne for several weeks and Renoir rewrote parts of the script to accommodate the rain. While he finished the script the entire company played cards and bonded; they described it as a happy time in their lives just before the horrors of World War II began. Paulette Dubost said shooting the film was great fun.

The delays caused Pierre Renoir to pull out of the film because of prior commitments to stage plays in Paris. Renoir then asked Michel Simon to play Octave but Simon was busy with other projects. Renoir finally cast himself, later saying that he &quot;was just waiting for the moment when Pierre would say &#x27;Why don&#x27;t you play the role yourself, Jean?&#x27; He didn&#x27;t have to ask me twice.&quot; He added that after having gained experience and confidence as a director his &quot;most stubborn dream has been to be an actor.&quot; Renoir rewrote the role of Octave to better suit himself since he and Pierre were physically and personally very different.

To raise additional funding for the over-running production, Zwoboda had used the success of &quot;La Bête Humaine&quot; to sell advanced screening rights in large theatres to Jean Jay, the director of the Gaumont Film Company. When shooting in Sologne finally began progress was slow because of the constant improvisations of the actorswhich Renoir encouragedand Gregor&#x27;s struggles with her role. Jay visited the set and was unhappy with the slow progress and with Renoir&#x27;s performance. The cast and crew however admired Renoir and enjoyed the carefree atmosphere on set, forgetting about the impending political situation. The cast&#x27;s improvisations caused some changes from the original script. Christine was initially written as a bored, upper class bourgeois whose main preoccupation was planning parties, but Renoir amended this to accommodate Gregor&#x27;s acting. Renoir also cut most of the references to Christine&#x27;s conductor father Stiller, such as his relationship with the Marquis. The Marquis was initially written as a patron of the arts and music instead of a collector of music boxes.

Journalists often visited the set and wrote positively about the production. The film was shot almost chronologically in Sologne and again in Joinville, Val-de-Marne, which Renoir considered important for the actors&#x27; performances. Renoir said he did not need to do much directing since the actors were so involved in their roles. When directing himself, Renoir arranged the performers movements first then acted in the scenes. Jay pushed Renoir to finish filming in Sologne and move the production to sets erected at the Pathé studios in Joinville. Renoir finally agreed and left Zwoboda, Corteggiani and Cartier-Bresson in Sologne to shoot B-roll footage of the rabbit hunting sequence. Hundreds of animals were killed during filming and local people were used as stand-ins for the actors.

Filming on the sets in Joinville continued at a slow pace. Renoir would often film fifteen to twenty takes of individual shots and change dialogue on the set, making previous takes useless. Film historian Joel Finler said the film &quot;truly &quot;evolved&quot;&quot; during its making, as Renoir worked on writing and rewriting the script, balancing and rebalancing the characters and relationships, plots and subplots.&quot; Cartier-Bresson said the improvisation during filming was like a jam session; both cast and crew members were encouraged to suggest ideas and dialogue would often change on the morning of the shoot.

On 16 March 1939, Germany invaded Czechoslovakia, breaking the Munich Agreement, which caused the French Army to start mobilizing in anticipation of a coming war. Shortly afterwards, several of the film&#x27;s electricians and technicians left to join the army. Set designer Eugène Lourié left because he was Jewish and a communist, and Max Douy took over as the film&#x27;s set designer.

During filming, Renoir became disappointed by Gregor&#x27;s performance. He began to cut her scenes and add new scenes for Paulette Dubost and Mila Parély. Film historian Gerald Mast found Gregor&#x27;s performance to be &quot;as haunting and bewitching as a plastic giraffe.&quot; During production, Jay told Renoir he hated his performance as Octave. Renoir offered to replace himself with Michel Simon, but Jay refused because two-thirds of the film had already been shot. Jay asked Renoir to instead remove Octave&#x27;s scenes, which had not yet been shot. Renoir refused, and throughout shooting he added new scenes for Octave. Shooting in Joinville finally wrapped in May 1939; the film was over schedule and the rented soundstage was needed for other films. Renoir originally wanted to release the film in June because the potential war would make a post-summer release impossible.

Renoir continued shooting additional scenes with some of the actors. The opening scene at the airfield was shot in mid-June at the Bourget Airport in the middle of the night with whatever extras they could find. Renoir almost ran out of money when he filmed the car crash scene, which was shot very quickly with Alain Renoir as the camera operator. Renoir never liked the scene and initially removed it. The principal photography was nine and a half weeks over schedule when it finally wrapped in June.

Despite beginning the shoot in love with Gregor, Renoir&#x27;s infatuation remained unrequited. During the film&#x27;s production, he ended his relationship with Marguerite and began another with script girl Dido Freire, whom he had known for 12 years and was Alain Renoir&#x27;s nanny. Eventually Dido married Renoir.

=== Initial editing and previews ===
Renoir edited the film while shooting; his first cut was three hours long. He and editor Marguerite completed a 113-minute final cut of the film in July 1939. Jay hated it and demanded that Renoir make cuts, including the excision of Renoir&#x27;s entire performance as Octave. Renoir refused to completely omit Octave but agreed to remove 13 minutes from the film.

&quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; was the most expensive film produced in France when it was released. Its original budget had been 2.5 million francs (which already made it the most expensive French film of that year) and was increased by another 2 million francs, costing over 5 million francs total.

The film had an elaborate advertising campaign that began one week before its release in anticipation of it becoming another hit film for Renoir. This campaign included a promotional crossword puzzle published three days before the film&#x27;s opening night; the prize for solving the puzzle was free tickets.

The first preview screening of the 113-minute version of &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; took place on 28 June 1939. It received a poor reaction from the audience. On 29 June, the film was screened for the Minister of National Education and Fine Arts Jean Zay and for the jury of the annual Louis Delluc Prize for the best French film. When the awards were announced 10 days later, Marcel Carne&#x27;s &quot;Le Quai des brumes&quot; won the first prize and &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; was not a runner-up. Because of the success and popularity of Renoir&#x27;s previous films, &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; was highly anticipated, and Zay had expected to award it the prize. Renoir later said he thought the film would be commercially successful.

=== Release and reception ===
&quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; premiered on Friday, 7 July 1939, at the Colisée Theatre in Paris to a full house and later at the Aubert Palace also in Paris. It was shown on a double bill with a patriotic documentary about French history. The audience at the screening consisted of members of the right-wing organisations, who booed after a while into the screening; Paulette Dubost said people at the screening fought, and one person tried to set fire to the theater. Renoir said he &quot;depicted pleasant, sympathetic characters, but showed them in a society in the process of disintegration, so that they were defeated at the onset ... the audience recognized this. The truth is that they recognized themselves. People who commit suicide do not care to do it in front of witnesses.&quot;

In France, film attendance was typically low in July; &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; ended its run at the Colisée Theatre after three weeks because of poor attendance. It later was shown at the Aubert-Palace in Paris. Renoir said of the attendance &quot;I was utterly dumbfounded when it became apparent that the film, which I wanted to be a pleasant one, rubbed most people the wrong way.&quot; Renoir initially wanted to screen the film at the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair in New York City, but this idea was abandoned after the disastrous release in France.

Claude Gauteur surveyed reviews of &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; published in Paris and said 12 were &quot;unqualifiedly unfavorable&quot;, 13 were &quot;favorable with reservations&quot;, and 10 were &quot;favorable.&quot; Many reviews criticized the film for being &quot;unpatriotic, frivolous and incomprehensible.&quot; One mixed review came from Nino Frank of &quot;Pour Vous&quot;, who called it &quot;a copious work, even too much so, very complex and profoundly intelligent from one end to the other.&quot; &quot;Le Figaro&quot; called it a &quot;bizarre spectacle&quot; which was &quot;one long succession of errors ... a heavy-handed fantasy with wooly dialogue.&quot; In the 1943 edition of &quot;Histoire du cinéma&quot;, Robert Brasillach wrote that &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; was among Renoir&#x27;s most &quot;jumbled&quot; and &quot;confused&quot; films but applauded the biting satire, which he considered &quot;Proustian.&quot; Brasillach also praised the technical variation employed by the director and said the film was an unrealized masterpiece. In the United States, a negative review from &quot;Variety&quot; said Renoir &quot;attempts to crowd too many ideas into 80 minutes of film fare, resulting in confusion.&quot; According to François Truffaut, the film was very disconcerting to audiences at the time because of its peculiar atmosphere, which explains its commercial failure.

While the film received mostly unfavorable reviews, most critics praised the actingincluding Renoir&#x27;s, and only the far right-wing press criticized Marcel Dalio&#x27;s performance. In July 1939 a right-wing French newspaper criticized the film for portraying the Jewish Marquis married to the Austrian Christine. The Union Sacrée, a French clerical fascist group, organized demonstrations wherever the film was screened. Renoir was a known pacifist and supporter of the Communist Party, which made him unpopular in the tense weeks before World War II began. Years later Renoir said &quot;there was no question of contrivance; my enemies had nothing to do with its failure. At every session I attended I could feel the unanimous disapproval of the audience.&quot;

In the weeks that followed the premiere, Renoir reduced the film&#x27;s running time from its original 113 minutes to 100 minutes, then to 90 minutes and finally to 85 minutes. He told Margurite Renoir and Zwoboda to cut the scenes that the audience had found the most upsetting. Renoir said he mostly cut his own scenes or dialogue &quot;as though I were ashamed, after this rebuff, of showing myself on the screen.&quot; He later defended his own performance as being awkwardthe way Octave should have been. The reduction in length removed Octave&#x27;s complexity and completely changed the character&#x27;s motives at the end of the film. In the 85-minute version, Octave does not intend to run away with Christine and merely lends André his coat for warmth before sending him out to the greenhouse. The omission of this item in the plot resulted in the misconception that the film has an alternative ending; this was first reported by Roger Manvell after he watched it at its London premiere in 1946. At one point, Jean Jay told Renoir to restore the film to the 100-minute version &quot;to avoid commercial disaster&quot;, but none of the shorter versions improved its reception or attendance figures. When asked about the film&#x27;s poor reception with audience members, Renoir said &quot;I thought I was gentle with them, and they thought I was laughing at them.&quot;

In October 1939 &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; officially was banned in France for being &quot;depressing, morbid, immoral [and] having an undesirable influence over the young.&quot; Other films that were similarly banned included Marcel Carné&#x27;s &quot;Le Quai des brumes&quot; and &quot;Le Jour Se Lève&quot;. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated &quot;we are especially anxious to avoid representations of our country, our traditions, and our race that changes its character, lie about it, and deform it through the prism of an artistic individual who is often original but not always sound.&quot; &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, one of the inspirations for the film, had been banned for similar reasons. After the end of World War II, the 85-minute version of the film was re-released in Paris on 26 September 1945, and it was banned again.

Renoir said that of all his films, &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; was the biggest failure at the time of its release. He also said its failure &quot;so depressed me that I resolved to either give up the cinema or to leave France.&quot; During shooting, Renoir was offered the chance to film an adaptation of &quot;Tosca&quot; by Italian producers; he agreed to the deal on 14 July 1939, and saw it as an opportunity to leave France. Renoir and Carl Koch traveled to Rome on 10 August for pre-production, but had to leave on 23 August after the German-Soviet pact made his French citizenship an issue. Koch directed the film instead and Renoir emigrated to Hollywood.

== Rediscovery ==
In 1942, during one of the Allied bombings of Boulogne-sur-Seine, the G.M. Film Lab, which housed the original negative of &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot;, was destroyed. In 1946, a print of the 85-minute version was found in a box, and a new print was made from it. This version was occasionally screened at film clubs, cinematheques and film festivals, and its reputation slowly began to grow. It finally premiered in New York City in April 1950, but it was critically unsuccessful. A review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;one for the buzzards&quot; and stated &quot;the master has dealt his admirers a pointless, thudding punch below the belt.&quot; In 1952, the 85-minute version was included in &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; inaugural list of the 10 greatest films ever made.

In 1956, film enthusiasts Jean Gaborit and Jacques Maréchal founded the Société des Grands Films Classiques, a film restoration company focused on neglected films. &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; was one of the company&#x27;s early restorations; Gaborit and Maréchal persuaded Camille François to sell them the rights to the film. With François&#x27; help, they discovered records that led to 224 boxes that had been found at the bombed G.M. Film Lab site. These boxes included negative prints, duplicated prints, and sound mixes of the film. With the help and advice of Renoir and Jacques Durand, Gaborit and Maréchal restored most of the cut footage from Renoir&#x27;s original version and assembled a 106-minute version of the film.

In mid-1959, Renoir saw the reconstructed version of the film for the first time and left the theater in tears. He said &quot;there is only one scene missing in this re-construction, a scene that isn&#x27;t very important. It&#x27;s a scene with me and Roland Toutain that deals with the maids&#x27; sexual interest.&quot; The restored version premiered at the 1959 Venice Film Festival, where it was called a masterpiece. Claude Chabrol, Alain Resnais and Louis Malle were all in attendance and publicly called Renoir their master while praising the reconstructed version of the film. In 1961 Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated the film &quot;completely justified its European reputation ... [it is] a memorable experience.&quot; Archer Winsten of the &quot;New York Post&quot; praised the film for &quot;showing the corruption of French society from top to bottom&quot; and a &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; review called it &quot;a satire on French society ... a sharp criticism of social pretenses.&quot; The reconstructed version of the film was exhibited in France on 23 April 1965. It won the 1966 Bodil Award for Best Non-American Film/Best European Film (Bedste europæiske film) in Denmark.

== Themes ==
&quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; is remembered as a commentary on the moral callousness of the European upper class and their servants just before World War II. While making the film, Renoir knew a new world war was coming; he later said there was a sense of it in film, and wrote &quot;it is a war film and yet there is no reference to the war&quot;. This sense of doom began just before shooting started in January when Barcelona fell to Franco and throughout the production when Prime Minister of France Édouard Daladier recognized Francoist Spain, Italy annexed Albania and Adolf Hitler prepared his Invasion of Poland. Renoir articulated this unmentioned theme of the film by saying:

what is interesting about this film, perhaps, is the moment when it was made. It was shot between Munich and the war, and I shot it absolutely impressed, absolutely disturbed by the state of mind of a part of French society, a part of English society, a part of world society. And it seemed to me that a way of interpreting this state of mind, to the world hopefully, was not to talk of that situation, but tell a frivolous story. I looked for inspiration to Beaumarchais, to Marivaux, to the classical authors of comedy.

Renoir wanted to depict people as they truly were at that point in history; he said &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; was &quot;a reconstructed documentary, a documentary on the condition of a society at a given moment&quot;. He believed this depiction was the reason behind the film&#x27;s disastrous premiere, saying &quot;the audience&#x27;s reaction was due to my candour&quot;. &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, an inspiration for the film, had also been considered controversial for its attack on the class system. &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; remained controversial with the French public shortly after World War II when it was once again banned. Renoir&#x27;s biographer Ronald Bergan said the film hit a raw nerve with the public by depicting &quot;people, who might have had an influence in shaping the world, [but] did nothing to prevent an advance of Fascism; some of whom, indeed, actually welcomed it&quot;.

The rabbit hunt scene is often compared to the senseless death that occurs during war; Renoir said he wanted to show a certain class of people killing for no reason. Renoir himself had never killed an animal and called hunting &quot;an abominable exercise in cruelty&quot;. Bergan saw the analogy to world events and wrote &quot;in the great set piece of the hunt, the callous cruelty of the guests is laid bare as they fire at any rabbit and bird that moves after the beaters have led the game to slaughter&quot;.

The film&#x27;s most-quoted line of dialogue, spoken by Octave, is &quot;You see, in this world, there is one awful thing, and that is that everyone has his reasons&quot;. Renoir&#x27;s sentiment of objective humanism for the film&#x27;s characters is articulated by Octave&#x27;s remark and shows his empathy for the people he was simultaneously criticizing. Richard Roud praised Renoir&#x27;s role in the film, observing that Renoir&#x27;s honesty compelled him to include his own role in his social criticism: &quot;he did not wish to stand outside. And Renoir/Octave serves as the standard against which reality and fiction can be measured.&quot; In his original outline for the film, Renoir said he intended all the characters to be sincere and that the film would have no villains.

Renoir said André was &quot;the victim, who, trying to fit into a world in which he does not belong, fails to respect the rules of the game&quot;, and that André thought he could shatter the rules by a world flight, while Christine thought she could do the same by following her heart. The &quot;rules&quot; of the film&#x27;s title are its only villain. Renoir said &quot;the world is made up of cliques ... Each of these cliques has its customs, its mores, indeed, its own language. To put it simply, each has its rules, and these rules determine the game.&quot; Renoir said all human activity is &quot;subject to social protocols that are less apparent than, but just as strict as, those practiced by Louis XIV.&quot; Renoir&#x27;s son Alain said the film continues to be relevant and popular because it shows the artificial joy of the modern age in contrast to the rules of that (or any) age.

== Style ==
Filming Émile Zola&#x27;s &quot;La Bête Humaine&quot; inspired Renoir to &quot;make a break, and perhaps get away from naturalism completely, to try to touch on a more classical, more poetic genre.&quot; While shooting, Renoir began listening to baroque music by Louis Couperin, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Jean-Baptiste Lully and André Grétry. He later said &quot;Little by little, my idea took shape and the subject got simpler. I kept living on baroque rhythms, and after a few more days, the subject became more and more precise.&quot; He also said he began imagining Simone Simon &quot;moving to the spirit of the music.&quot; This preoccupation with baroque music during filming led to Renoir&#x27;s original idea of adapting &quot;Les Caprices de Marianne&quot; into a film.

&quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; is known for its early and elaborate use of deep focus cinematography. Renoir said he and his cinematographer Jean Bachelet &quot;ordered some special lenses, very fast lenses, but ones that still gave us considerable depth, so that we could keep our backgrounds in focus almost all the time.&quot; This depth of field in his shots allowed Renoir to shoot in large rooms and long corridors in the chateau sequences, and characters were able to move freely between the background and the foreground. Approximately half of the shots in the film have camera movements. In many shots the camera moves, stops in place, changes direction and circles around the subjects. Film critic David Thomson said &quot;one has the impression of a camera that is always moving to cover as much as possible. One does not notice cuts, one delights in a continuity which is often on the verge of chaos and finally leads to tragedy in the intrusion of subplot into plot, of the theatrical into the real and of disaster into balances.&quot;

Renoir used few close-ups or reverse shots and most of the shots are two shots. The hunt scene differs from the rest of the film; it uses rapid editing whereas most of the film uses long takes of dialogue or action. Renoir wanted to shoot the film in color to take advantage of the beauty of Sologne in the winter but he was unable to secure funding from Jean Jay. One week before filming began Renoir tried to persuade Technicolor to fund the color cinematography but the company refused.

The sound in the film was complex for its time; it included dialogue spoken over ambient noises such as crowds at the airport and gunfire during the hunt. Film director Jean Prat said the film&#x27;s soundtrack was &quot;of a perfection never equaled by any French film.&quot; Characters often talk at once or talk over each other&#x27;s lines. One example of the dense soundtrack is the party scene, which includes dialogue over screams, gunfire and music. Except for the opening credits and the very end of the film, all of the music heard in the film is incidental. The sound engineer was Joseph de Bretagne. Music used in the film includes Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Three German Dances&quot;, Monsigny&#x27;s &quot;Le déserteur&quot;, Louis Byrec, Léon Garnier and Eugène Rimbault&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;, Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;Danse macabre&quot;, Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Minute Waltz&quot; and Scotto&#x27;s &quot;À Barbizon&quot;. The music was arranged by Joseph Kosma and Roger Désormière.

The film&#x27;s set designers Eugène Lourié and Max Douy built one of the most expensive sets in French film history at the Joinville Studio. According to Douy they were based on the script and were not reproductions of the interior of Chateau de la Ferté-Saint-Aubin, where exterior scenes were shot. The music boxes used in the film were borrowed from several sources and some are now in a museum in Neuilly-sur-Seine. Renoir thought the musical organ scene and Dalio&#x27;s performance in it was the best scene he had ever filmed. He shot the scene several times before he was satisfied with it. The costumes for the film were designed by Coco Chanel.

== Legacy ==
Since its restoration, &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; has come to be regarded by many film critics and directors as one of the greatest films of all time. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 97% based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 9.50/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Its genius escaped many viewers at the time, but in retrospect, &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; stands as one of Jean Renoir&#x27;s—and cinema&#x27;s—finest works.&quot; The decennial poll of international critics by &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; magazine ranked it #10 in 1952, elevated it to No. 3 in 1962, and #2 in 1972, 1982 and 1992. In 2002 it fell to No. 3 behind &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and &quot;Vertigo&quot;. In 2012, it fell to No. 4, behind &quot;Vertigo&quot;, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, and &quot;Tokyo Story&quot;. It is the only film to have been included on every top ten list since 1952. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked at number 13 in its list of &quot;The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema&quot; in 2010. In &quot;Le Figaro&quot; 2008 list of the greatest films ever made it tied for second with &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot;, behind &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. In 2018 the film ranked fifth on the BBC&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest foreign-language films, as voted on by 209 film critics from 43 countries.

Critics and directors who have placed it on their &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; lists include Richard Peña, Michel Ciment, David Denby, Lawrence Kasdan, Steve McQueen and Paul Schrader. Schrader said the film &quot;has it all ... [it] represents all that film can be.&quot; Martin Scorsese included it on a list of &quot;39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker.&quot; French film critic André Bazin praised the film&#x27;s mobile cinematographic style; he said its depth of field and deep focus &quot;mise-en-scène&quot; resembled that seen in &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives.&quot;

Many contemporary film critics have written favorably about the film. It has been hailed as a masterpiece by Kent Jones, Adolf Heinzlmeier, Berndt Schulz and Penelope Gilliatt, who said it was &quot;not only a masterpiece of filmmaking, not only a great work of humanism in a perfect rococo frame, but also an act of historical testimony.&quot; Its themes have been analyzed by film scholar and Renoir&#x27;s biographer Leo Braudy, who observed that the film &quot;embodies a social world in which there are rules but no values. If you don&#x27;t know the rules, you are crushed; but if you do know the rules you are cut off from your own nature.&quot; Dudley Andrew described the film&#x27;s &quot;complex social criticism&quot; while Kenneth Browser and Peter Cowie wrote about its sense of humanity. Other critics have written about the film&#x27;s darker themes; Andrew Sarris praised its depiction of class differences. The complexity of Renoir&#x27;s storytelling techniques have been examined by Roger Ebert, who called it &quot;so simple and so labyrinthine, so guileless and so angry, so innocent and so dangerous, that you can&#x27;t simply watch it, you have to absorb it&quot;, Lucy Sante, who labeled it &quot;a dense clockwork mechanism&quot; and Robin Wood, who said the film &quot;operates on all levels.&quot; Critics have praised its farcical elements: Pauline Kael characterized it as &quot;a great satirical comedy, a dance of death&quot; and Gerald Mast wrote &quot;[it] depicts the failure of love, the failure of society, and the failure of men to rise above the ridiculous. Their only success is that they try and they care.&quot; David Thomson praised Renoir&#x27;s performance and remarked on &quot;Renoir&#x27;s admission that the director, supposedly the authoritative and manipulating figure, is as much victim as originator of circumstances.&quot; Amy Taubin said &quot;I can think of no other film that is as unfailingly generousto its audience, its characters, its actors, the milieu and the medium.&quot; J. Hoberman wrote about its influence on Woody Allen, Robert Altman and Mike Leigh.

The film especially was appreciated by filmmakers and film critics associated with the French New Wave movement. Bazin said &quot;as a conventional love story, the film could have been a success if the scenario had respected the rules of the movie game. But Renoir wanted to make his own style of &quot;drame gai&quot; [merry drama], and the mixture of genres proved disconcerting to the public.&quot; Film critic Claude Beylie called it &quot;the cornerstone of the work of Jean Renoir, the point of arrival and the swan song of the French cinema of the thirties ...&quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; is a rare combination of satire, vaudeville and tragedy.&quot; It was a major source of inspiration for Alain Resnais, who said seeing the film was &quot;the single most overwhelming experience I have ever had at the cinema&quot;;and Louis Malle, who said &quot;for all of us, my generation of French filmmakers, &quot;La Règle du jeu&quot; was the absolute masterpiece.&quot; François Truffaut articulated the film&#x27;s enormous influence and said &quot;it isn&#x27;t an accident that &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; inspired a large number of young people who had first thought of expressing themselves as novelists to take up careers as filmmakers.&quot; He also said &quot;It is the credo of movie lovers, the film of films, the film most hated when it was made and most appreciated afterwards, to the extent that it ultimately became a true commercial success.&quot;

Satyajit Ray called it &quot;a film that doesn&#x27;t wear its innovations on its sleeve ... Humanist? Classical? &quot;Avant-Garde&quot;? Contemporary? I defy anyone to give it a label. This is the kind of innovation that appeals to me.&quot; Other notable filmmakers who have praised it include Bernardo Bertolucci, Wim Wenders, Peter Bogdanovich, Noah Baumbach and Cameron Crowe. Henri Cartier-Bresson, who worked on the film before beginning a long career as a photojournalist, called it &quot;one of the summits of art and a premonition of everything that was to happen in the world.&quot; Robert Altman said &quot;&quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; taught me the rules of the game.&quot;

Altman&#x27;s &quot;Gosford Park&quot; is similar to &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; in many of its plot elements, including the relationship between wealthy people and their servants as well as the hunting sequence. Italian film critic Francis Vanoye stated &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; has influenced numerous films that feature a group of characters who spend a short time together at a party or gatheringoften while hunting animalsduring which their true feelings about each other are revealed. Along with &quot;Gosford Park&quot;, these films include Jean Grémillon&#x27;s &quot;Summer Light&quot;, Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Smiles of a Summer Night&quot;, Carlos Saura&#x27;s &quot;The Hunt&quot;, Peter Fleischmann&#x27;s &quot;Hunting Scenes from Bavaria&quot;, Nikita Mikhalkov&#x27;s &quot;An Unfinished Piece for a Player Piano&quot;, Theo Angelopoulos&#x27;s &quot;The Hunters&quot; and Denys Arcand&#x27;s &quot;The Decline of the American Empire&quot;. Paul Bartel&#x27;s &quot;Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills&quot; and Lawrence Kasdan&#x27;s &quot;The Big Chill&quot; have also been compared to &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot;.

<doc id="202140" wikidata="Q162331" url="?curid=202140" title="The 400 Blows">
<text>The 400 Blows () is a 1959 French coming-of-age drama film, and the directorial debut of François Truffaut, who also co-wrote the film. Shot in the anamorphic format DyaliScope, the film stars Jean-Pierre Léaud, Albert Rémy, and Claire Maurier. One of the defining films of the French New Wave, it displays many of the characteristic traits of the movement. Written by Truffaut and Marcel Moussy, the film is about Antoine Doinel (a semi-autobiographical character), a misunderstood adolescent in Paris, who struggles with his parents and teachers due to his rebellious behavior. It was filmed on location, in Paris and Honfleur. 

&quot;The 400 Blows&quot; received numerous awards and nominations, including the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director, the OCIC Award, and a Palme d&#x27;Or nomination in 1959, and was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in 1960. The film had 4.1 million admissions in France, making it Truffaut&#x27;s most successful film in his home country.

&quot;The 400 Blows&quot; is widely considered one of the best films ever made; in the 2022 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll of the greatest films ever made, it was ranked 50th. It ranked 33rd in the directors&#x27; poll on the same list.

It is the first in a series of five films in which Léaud plays the lead character. The film is followed by a short film, &quot;Antoine and Colette&quot; (1962) and three legacy sequels, &quot;Stolen Kisses&quot; (1968), &quot;Bed and Board&quot; (1970) and &quot;Love on the Run&quot; (1979), with the actor reprising his role as Doinel.

==Plot==
Antoine Doinel is a young boy growing up in Paris. Misunderstood by his parents for skipping school and stealing and tormented in school for disciplinary problems by his teacher (such as writing on the classroom wall and later lying about his absences as being due to his mother&#x27;s death), he frequently runs away from both places. He finally quits school after his teacher accuses him of plagiarizing Balzac, though Antoine loves Balzac and in a school essay he describes &quot;the death of my grandfather,&quot; in a close paraphrase of Balzac from memory. He steals a Royal typewriter from his stepfather&#x27;s workplace to finance his plans to leave home, but being unable to sell it, he is apprehended while trying to return it.

The stepfather turns Antoine over to police and Antoine spends the night in jail, sharing a cell with prostitutes and thieves. During an interview with the judge, Antoine&#x27;s mother confesses that her husband is not her son&#x27;s biological father. Antoine is placed in an observation center for troubled youths near the seashore (as his mother wished). A psychologist at the center looks for reasons for Antoine&#x27;s unhappiness, which the youth reveals in a fragmented series of monologues.

While playing football with the other boys, Antoine escapes under a fence and runs away to the ocean, which he has always wanted to see. He reaches the shoreline of the sea and runs into it. The film concludes with a freeze-frame of Antoine, which, via an optical effect, zooms in on his face as he looks into the camera.

==Cast==

* Jean-Pierre Léaud as Antoine Doinel
* Albert Rémy as Julien Doinel, Antoine&#x27;s stepfather
* Claire Maurier as Gilberte Doinel, Antoine&#x27;s mother
* Guy Decomble as Sourpuss, schoolteacher
* Patrick Auffay as René Bigey, Antoine&#x27;s best friend
* Georges Flamant as Monsieur Bigey, René&#x27;s father
* Pierre Repp as an English teacher
* Daniel Couturier as Betrand Mauricet
* Luc Andrieux as Le professeur de gym
* Robert Beauvais as director of the school
* Yvonne Claudie as Mme Bigey
* as L&#x27;inspecteur Cabanel
* as the examining magistrate
* Jacques Monod as commissioner
* Henri Virlojeux as the night watchman
* Jeanne Moreau as a woman looking for her dog
* Jean-Claude Brialy as a man trying to pick up a woman
Truffaut also included a number of friends (fellow directors) in bit or background parts, including himself and Philippe De Broca in the funfair scene; Jacques Demy as a policeman; Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Paul Belmondo as overheard voices (Belmondo&#x27;s in the print works scene).

==Themes==
The semi-autobiographical film reflects events of Truffaut&#x27;s life. In style, it references other French works—most notably a scene borrowed wholesale from Jean Vigo&#x27;s &quot;Zéro de conduite&quot;. Truffaut dedicated the film to the man who became his spiritual father, André Bazin, who died just as the film was about to be shot.

Besides being a character study, the film is an exposé of the injustices of the treatment of juvenile offenders in France at the time.

According to Annette Insdorf writing for the Criterion Collection, the film is &quot;rooted in Truffaut&#x27;s childhood.&quot; This includes how both Antoine and Truffaut &quot;found a substitute home in the movie theater&quot; and both did not know their biological fathers.

==Production==
===Title===
The English title is a literal translation of the French that fails to capture its meaning, as the French title refers to the idiom &quot;faire les quatre cents coups&quot;, meaning &quot;to raise hell&quot;. On the first prints in the United States, subtitler and dubber Noelle Gillmor translated the title as &quot;Wild Oats&quot;, but the distributor Zenith did not like that and reverted it to &quot;The 400 Blows.&quot;

===Filming locations===
Most of &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; was filmed in Paris:
* Avenue Frochot, Paris 9th
* Eiffel Tower, Champ de Mars, Paris 7th
* Montmartre, Paris 18th
* Palais de Chaillot, Trocadéro, Paris 16th
* Pigalle, Paris 9th
* Rue Fontaine
* Sacré Cœur, Paris 18th
The exception was for scenes filmed at the reform school, which were filmed in Honfleur, a small coastal town in the northern French province of Normandy. The final beach scene was filmed in Villers-sur-Mer, a few miles to the southwest.

==Release==
===Reception===
The film opened the 1959 Cannes Film Festival and was widely acclaimed, winning numerous awards, including the Best Director Award at Cannes, the Critics Award of the 1959 New York Film Critics&#x27; Circle and the Best European Film Award at 1960&#x27;s Bodil Awards. It was nominated for Best Original Screenplay at the 32nd Academy Awards. The film holds a 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 71 reviews, with a weighted average of 9.4/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;A seminal French New Wave film that offers an honest, sympathetic, and wholly heartbreaking observation of adolescence without trite nostalgia.&quot;

The film is among the top 10 of the British Film Institute&#x27;s list of 50 films that should be seen by age 15.

===Awards and nominations===
==Legacy==
Truffaut made four other films with Léaud depicting Antoine at later stages of his life: &quot;Antoine and Colette&quot; (which was Truffaut&#x27;s contribution to the 1962 anthology &quot;Love at Twenty&quot;), &quot;Stolen Kisses&quot;, &quot;Bed and Board&quot;, and &quot;Love on the Run&quot;.

Filmmakers Akira Kurosawa, Luis Buñuel, Satyajit Ray, Steven Spielberg, Jean Cocteau, Carl Theodor Dreyer, Richard Linklater, Tsai Ming Liang, Woody Allen, Richard Lester, P C Sreeram, Norman Jewison, Wes Anderson and Nicolas Cage have cited &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; as one of their favorite movies. Kurosawa called it &quot;one of the most beautiful films that I have ever seen&quot;.

Martin Scorsese included it on a list of &quot;39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker.&quot;

The film was ranked #29 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010. In 2018, the film was voted the eighth greatest foreign-language film of all time in BBC&#x27;s poll of 209 critics in 43 countries.

The festival poster for the 71st Venice International Film Festival paid tribute to the film as it featured the character of Antoine Doinel portrayed by Jean-Pierre Léaud.

<doc id="202145" wikidata="Q7821821" url="?curid=202145" title="Tony Baltazar">
<text>Anthony Baltazar (born February 5, 1961) is an American former boxer that competed in the Lightweight division. After an amateur career during which he won various titles, he turned professional in the late 1970s, and boxed the likes of Robin Blake, former world champion Roger Mayweather (whom he beat by ten round unanimous decision), Hector Macho Camacho and Carlos Bolillo Gonzalez, the last two of which Baltazar fought for world titles. Baltazar was a contender at the Lightweight and Jr. Welterweight divisions.

==Early life==
Baltazar was born in Los Angeles, California and is the brother of former boxers Robert Baltazar and Frankie Baltazar.

==Professional career==
Baltazar grew up in La Puente, Calif, Baltazar now resides in Phoenix. He was one time the holder of a WBO regional title, the &quot;North American Boxing Organization&quot; Jr. Welterweight championship. His brother, Frankie Baltazar, was also a top rated contender during most of the 1980s.

In 1995, Baltazar and his wife had a son who developed a strange blood disease. Two years later, the disease was diagnosed and Baltazar and his family started travelling constantly to Rochester, Minnesota for treatment. In between, Baltazar organized a foundation that helps grow funds for kids with that disease. After constant improvement and fall backs, Baltazar&#x27;s son died in 2001, at the age of 6. In memory of his son, Baltazar has kept the foundation on working, and he and his helpers organize charity boxing undercards, rodeos and auctions every year.

===Retirement===
Baltazar&#x27;s activities have been attended by several celebrities, such as world champion boxers George Foreman, Evander Holyfield and Carlos Palomino, as well as a varied list of Hollywood actors. In 2001, the auction charity was attended by Alice Cooper, former world boxing champion Michael Carbajal, daredevil &quot;Spanky Spangler&quot; and others.
The Baltazar brothers Frankie, Tony and Bobby were trained and managed by their father, Frank Baltazar sr.

Tony now works at Jacksons car wash in Arizona as a glass sales representative.

<text>Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure – popularly known as Fanny Hill – is an erotic novel by the English novelist John Cleland first published in London in 1748. Written while the author was in debtors&#x27; prison in London, it is considered &quot;the first original English prose pornography, and the first pornography to use the form of the novel&quot;. It is one of the most prosecuted and banned books in history.

The book exemplifies the use of euphemism. The text has no swearing or explicit scientific terms for body parts, but uses many literary devices to describe genitalia. For example, the vagina is sometimes referred to as &quot;the nethermouth&quot;.

A critical edition by Peter Sabor includes a bibliography and explanatory notes. The collection &quot;Launching &quot;Fanny Hill&quot;&quot; contains several essays on the historical, social and economic themes underlying the novel.

==Publishing history==
The novel was published in two installments, on 21 November 1748 and in February 1749, by Fenton Griffiths and his brother Ralph under the name &quot;G. Fenton&quot;. There has been speculation that the novel was at least partly written by 1740, when Cleland was stationed in Bombay as an employee of the East India Company.

Initially, there was no governmental reaction to the novel. However, in November 1749, a year after the first installment was published, Cleland and Ralph Griffiths were arrested and charged with &quot;corrupting the King&#x27;s subjects&quot;. In court, Cleland renounced the novel and it was officially withdrawn.

As the book became popular, pirate editions appeared. It was once believed that the scene near the end, in which Fanny reacts with disgust at the sight of two young men engaging in anal intercourse, was an interpolation made for these pirated editions, but the scene is present in the first edition (p. xxiii). In the 19th century, copies of the book were sold underground in the UK, the US and elsewhere. In 1887, a French edition appeared with illustrations by Édouard-Henri Avril.

The book eventually made its way to the United States. In 1821, a Massachusetts court outlawed &quot;Fanny Hill&quot;. The publisher, Peter Holmes, was convicted for printing a &quot;lewd and obscene&quot; novel. Holmes appealed to the Massachusetts Supreme Court. He claimed that the judge, relying only on the prosecution&#x27;s description, had not even seen the book. The state Supreme Court was not swayed. The Chief Justice wrote that Holmes was &quot;a scandalous and evil disposed person&quot; who had contrived to &quot;debauch and corrupt&quot; the citizens of Massachusetts and &quot;to raise and create in their minds inordinate and lustful desires&quot;.

===Mayflower (UK) edition===
In 1963, after the 1960 court decision in &quot;R v Penguin Books Ltd&quot; that allowed the continuing publication of &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;, Gareth Powell&#x27;s Mayflower Books published an uncensored paperback version of &quot;Fanny Hill&quot;. The police became aware of the 1963 edition a few days before publication, having spotted a sign in the window of the Magic Shop in Tottenham Court Road in London, run by Ralph Gold. An officer went to the shop, bought a copy, and delivered it to Bow Street magistrate Sir Robert Blundell, who issued a search warrant. At the same time, two officers from the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s Obscene Publications Branch visited Mayflower Books in Vauxhall Bridge Road to determine whether copies of the book were kept on the premises. They interviewed Powell, the publisher, and took away the five copies there. The police returned to the Magic Shop and seized 171 copies of the book, and in December, Gold was summonsed under section 3 of the Obscene Publications Act 1959. By then, Mayflower had distributed 82,000 copies of the book, but it was Gold who was being tried, although Mayflower covered the legal costs. The trial took place in February 1964. The defence argued that &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; was a historical source book and that it was a joyful celebration of normal non-perverted sex—bawdy rather than pornographic. The prosecution countered by stressing one atypical scene involving flagellation, and won. Mayflower elected not to appeal.

Luxor Press published a 9/6 edition in January 1964, using text &quot;exactly the same as that employed for the de-luxe edition&quot; in 1963. The back cover features praise from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and from the author and critic Marghanita Laski. It went through many reprints in the first couple of years.

The Mayflower case highlighted the growing disconnect between the obscenity laws and the permissive society that was developing in late 1960s Britain, and was instrumental in shifting views to the point where in 1970 an uncensored version of &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; was again published in Britain.

===1960s US edition: prosecutions and court rulings===
In 1963, Putnam published the book in the United States under the title &quot;John Cleland&#x27;s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure&quot;. This edition led to the arrest of New York City bookstore owner Irwin Weisfeld and clerk John Downs as part of an anti-obscenity campaign orchestrated by several major political figures. Weisfeld&#x27;s conviction was eventually overturned in state court and the New York ban of &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; lifted. The new edition was also banned for obscenity in Massachusetts, after a mother complained to the state&#x27;s Obscene Literature Control Commission. The Massachusetts high court did rule &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; obscene and the publisher&#x27;s challenge to the ban then went up to the Supreme Court. In a landmark decision in 1966, the United States Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Memoirs v. Massachusetts&quot; that &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; did not meet the &quot;Roth&quot; standard for obscenity.

The art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann recommended the work in a letter for &quot;its delicate sensitivities and noble ideas&quot; expressed in &quot;an elevated Pindaric style&quot;.

==Illustrations==
The original work was not illustrated, but many editions of this book have contained illustrations, often depicting the novel&#x27;s sexual content. Distributors of the novel such as John Crosby were imprisoned for &quot;exhibiting [not selling] to sundry persons a certain lewd and indecent book, containing very lewd and obscene pictures or engravings&quot;. Sellers of the novel such as Peter Holmes were imprisoned and charged that they &quot;did utter, publish and deliver to one [name]; a certain lewd, wicked, scandalous, infamous and obscene print, on paper, was contained in a certain printed book then and there uttered, [2] published and delivered by him said Peter Holmes intitled &quot;Memoirs of a Woman Of Pleasure&quot; to manifest corruption and subversion of youth, and other good citizens ... &quot;

None of the story&#x27;s scenes have been exempt from illustration. Illustrations of this novel vary from the first homosexual experience to the flagellation scene.

Although editions of the book have frequently featured illustrations, many have been of poor quality. An exception to this is the set of mezzotints, probably designed by the artist George Morland and engraved by his friend John Raphael Smith that accompanied one edition.

==Plot==

The novel consists of two long letters (which appear as volumes I and II of the original edition) to an unnamed acquaintance identified only as &#x27;Madam,&#x27; written by Frances &#x27;Fanny&#x27; Hill, a rich Englishwoman in her middle age, who leads a life of contentment with her loving husband Charles and their children. Fanny has been prevailed upon by &#x27;Madam&#x27; to recount the &#x27;scandalous stages&#x27; of her earlier life, which she proceeds to do with &#x27;stark naked truth&#x27; as her governing principle.

The first letter begins with a short account of Fanny&#x27;s impoverished childhood in a Lancashire village. At age 14, she loses her parents to smallpox, arrives in London to look for domestic work, and gets lured into a brothel. She sees a sexual encounter between an ugly older couple and another between a young attractive couple, and participates in a lesbian encounter with Phoebe, a bisexual prostitute. A customer, Charles, induces Fanny to escape. She loses her virginity to Charles and becomes his lover. Charles is sent away by deception to the South Seas, and Fanny is driven by desperation and poverty to become the kept woman of a rich merchant named Mr H—. After enjoying a brief period of stability, she sees Mr H— have a sexual encounter with her own maid, and goes on to seduce Will (the young footman of Mr H—) as an act of revenge. She is discovered by Mr H— as she is having a sexual encounter with Will. After being abandoned by Mr H—, Fanny becomes a prostitute for wealthy clients in a pleasure-house run by Mrs Cole. This marks the end of the first letter.

The second letter begins with a rumination on the tedium of writing about sex and the difficulty of driving a middle course between vulgar language and &quot;mincing metaphors and affected circumlocutions&quot;. Fanny then describes her adventures in the house of Mrs Cole, which include a public orgy, an elaborately orchestrated bogus sale of her &quot;virginity&quot; to a rich dupe called Mr Norbert, and a sado-masochistic session with a man involving mutual flagellation with birch-rods. These are interspersed with narratives which do not involve Fanny directly; for instance, three other girls in the house (Emily, Louisa and Harriett) describe their own losses of virginity, and the nymphomaniac Louisa seduces the immensely endowed but imbecilic &quot;good-natured Dick&quot;. Fanny also describes anal intercourse between two older boys (removed from several later editions). Eventually Fanny retires from prostitution and becomes the lover of a rich and worldly-wise man of 60 (described by Fanny as a &quot;rational pleasurist&quot;). This phase of Fanny&#x27;s life brings about her intellectual development, and leaves her wealthy when her lover dies of a sudden cold. Soon after, she has a chance encounter with Charles, who has returned as a poor man to England after being shipwrecked. Fanny offers her fortune to Charles unconditionally, but he insists on marrying her.

The novel&#x27;s developed characters include Charles, Mrs Jones (Fanny&#x27;s landlady), Mrs Cole, Will, Mr H— and Mr Norbert. The prose includes long sentences with many subordinate clauses. Its morality is conventional for the time, in that it denounces sodomy, frowns upon vice and approves of only heterosexual unions based upon mutual love.

===Analysis===
The plot was described as &#x27;operatic&#x27; by John Hollander, who said that &quot;the book&#x27;s language and its protagonist&#x27;s character are its greatest virtues&quot;.

Literary critic Felicity A. Nussbaum describes the girls in Mrs Cole&#x27;s brothel as a little troop of love&#x27; who provide compliments, caresses, and congratulation to their fellow whores&#x27; erotic achievements&quot;.

According to literary critic Thomas Holmes, Fanny and Mrs Cole see the homosexual act thus: &quot;the act subverts not only the hierarchy of the male over the female, but also what they consider nature&#x27;s law regarding the role of intercourse and procreation&quot;.

== Themes and genre ==
=== Metonymy ===
There are numerous scholars who claim that &quot;Fanny&quot; in her name refers to a woman&#x27;s vulva, or that &quot;Hill&quot; refers to the &quot;mons pubis&quot;, mound of Venus. However, this interpretation lacks corroborating evidence: the term &quot;fanny&quot; is first known to have been used to mean female genitalia in the 1830s, and no 18th-century dictionary defines &quot;fanny&quot; in this way.

=== Disability ===

Later in the text when Fanny is with Louisa, they come across a boy nicknamed &quot;Good-natured Dick&quot; who is described as having some mental disability/handicap. Louisa brings the boy in anyway, as Dick&#x27;s functioning physical state supersedes his poor mental one. This scene also leads into an issue within the text of rape (for both Dick and Louisa) and how the possible label of rape is removed by resistance transitioning into pleasure.

=== &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; as a &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; ===
One scholar, David McCracken, writes about &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; as a &quot;bildungsroman&quot;. Her sexual development contains three life stages: innocence, experimentation, and experience. McCracken specifically addresses how Fanny&#x27;s word selections on describing the phallus change throughout the stages. Fanny sees the phallus as both an object of terror and of delight. McCracken relates her changing view of the phallus to Burke&#x27;s theory of the sublime and beautiful.

=== Shame ===

Patricia Spacks discusses how Fanny has been previously deprived by her rural environment of what she can understand as real experience, and how she welcomes the whores&#x27; efforts to educate her. Since Fanny is so quickly catapulted into her new life, she has had little time to reflect on the shame and regret that she feels for leading a life of adultery, and replaces this shame with the pleasure of sexual encounters with men and women. Even though these feelings may have been replaced or forgotten, she still reflects on her past: &quot;...and since I was now bent over the bar, I thought by plunging over head and ears into the stream I was hurried away by, to drown all sense of shame or reflection&quot;. Having little time to think about how she feels about her transition, she masks her thoughts with sexual pleasure, yet this is not a total fix to forget her emotions.

== Narrative voice ==

Andrea Haslanger argues in her dissertation how the use of first-person narrative in the 18th century &quot;undermines, rather than secures, the individual&quot; in classic epistolary novels like by Daniel Defoe, &quot;Evelina&quot; by Fanny Burney, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; by Mary Shelley and specifically &quot;Fanny Hill&quot;. Haslanger claims that &quot;the paradox of pornographic narration is that it mobilizes certain aspects of the first person (the description of intimate details) while eradicating others (the expression of disagreement or resistance)&quot; (19). With this in mind, she raises the question of &quot;whether &#x27;I&#x27; denotes consciousness or body or both&quot; (34).

== &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; versus the traditional conduct novel ==
With sexual acts being viewed as taboo within 18th-century England, &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; strayed far away from the norm in comparison to other works of its time. A large portion of books that focused on the idea of sex were written in the form of conduct novels: books that would focus on teaching women the proper ways to behave and live their lives in as virtuous a manner as possible. These novels encouraged women to stay away from sexual deviance, for if they were to remain virtuous then they would ultimately be rewarded. One example of this is Samuel Richardson&#x27;s conduct novel &quot;Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded&quot;, in which the character of Pamela is able to resist sexual temptation, thus maintaining her virtue and being rewarded in the end with a prosperous life.

However, &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; was widely considered to be the first work of its time to focus on the idea of sexual deviance being an act of pleasure, rather than something that was simply shameful. This can be seen through Fanny&#x27;s character partaking in acts that would normally be viewed as deplorable by society&#x27;s standards, but then is never punished for them. In fact, Fanny is ultimately able to achieve her own happy ending when she is able to find Charles again, marrying him and living in a life of wealth. This can be viewed in sharp contrast to a work like &quot;Pamela&quot;, where sexual acts are avoided for the sake of maintaining virtue. Meanwhile, within &quot;Fanny Hill&quot;, normally deplorable acts can be conducted with little to no consequence.

<text>George Louis Palmella Busson du Maurier (6 March 1834 – 8 October 1896) was a Franco-British cartoonist and writer known for work in &quot;Punch&quot; and a Gothic novel &quot;Trilby&quot;, featuring the character Svengali. His son was the actor Sir Gerald du Maurier. The writers Angela du Maurier and Daphne du Maurier and the artist Jeanne du Maurier were all granddaughters of George. He was also father of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies and grandfather of the five boys who inspired J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan&quot;.

==Early life==
George du Maurier was born in Paris, France, son of Louis-Mathurin Busson du Maurier and wife Ellen Clarke, daughter of the Regency courtesan Mary Anne Clarke. He was brought up to believe his aristocratic grandparents had fled from France during the Revolution, leaving vast estates behind, to live in England as émigrés. In fact, du Maurier&#x27;s grandfather, Robert-Mathurin Busson, was a tradesman who left Paris, France, in 1789 to avoid charges of fraud and later changed the family name to the grander-sounding du Maurier.

Du Maurier studied art in Paris, France, in the studio of Charles Gleyre, and moved to Antwerp, Belgium, where he lost the vision in his left eye. He was reportedly studying chemistry at University College, London, in 1851. He is recorded in the 1861 England Census as a lodger at 85 Newman St in Marylebone.

He met Emma Wightwick in 1853 and married her a decade later, on 3 January 1863, at St Marylebone, Westminster. Moving frequently over the course of their marriage, the couple first settled in Hampstead in 1869, initially at Gang Moor near the Whitestone Pond for three years, before moving to 27 Church Row and later at New Grove House in Hampstead Grove in 1881. In 1891, the family is recorded as residing at 2 Porchester Rd in Paddington. They had five children: Beatrix (known as Trixy), Guy, Sylvia, Marie Louise (known as May) and Gerald.

==Career==
===Cartoonist===
Du Maurier became a member of staff at the British satirical magazine &quot;Punch&quot; in 1865, drawing two cartoons a week. His commonest targets were the affected manners of Victorian society, the bourgeoisie and members of Britain&#x27;s growing middle class in particular. His most enduring cartoon, &quot;True Humility&quot; (1895), popularised the expressions &quot;good in parts&quot; and &quot;a curate&#x27;s egg&quot;. In it, a bishop addresses a humble curate, whom he has invited to breakfast: &quot;I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;ve got a bad egg, Mr. Jones.&quot; The curate replies, &quot;Oh no, my Lord, I assure you – parts of it are excellent!&quot; The gag was not original to du Maurier, however, as it had appeared in a similar cartoon a few months earlier in &quot;Judy&quot;, a less widely read competitor to &quot;Punch&quot;. In an earlier (1884) cartoon, du Maurier coined the expression &quot;&quot;, with which he satirised medical care. Another of his notable cartoons depicted a fanciful videophone conversation in 1879, using a device he called &quot;Edison&#x27;s telephonoscope&quot;.

While producing black-and-white drawings for &quot;Punch&quot;, du Maurier created illustrations for several other popular periodicals: &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Graphic&quot;, &quot;The Illustrated Times&quot;, &quot;The Cornhill Magazine&quot;, and the religious periodical &quot;Good Words&quot;. Furthermore, he did illustrations for the serialisation of Charles Warren Adams&#x27;s &quot;The Notting Hill Mystery&quot;, which is often seen as the first detective story of novel length to have appeared in English. Among several other novels he illustrated was &quot;Misunderstood&quot; by Florence Montgomery in 1873.

===Writer===

His deteriorating eyesight caused du Maurier to reduce his involvement with &quot;Punch&quot; in 1891 and settle in Hampstead, where he wrote three novels. His first, &quot;Peter Ibbetson&quot; (1891), was a modest success at the time and later adapted for stage and screen, most notably in a 1935 film, and as an opera.

His second novel, &quot;Trilby&quot;, published in 1894, fitted into the gothic horror genre that was undergoing a revival. Hugely popular, it tells of a poor artist&#x27;s model, Trilby O&#x27;Ferrall, transformed into a diva under the spell of an evil musical genius, Svengali. Soap, songs, dances, toothpaste, and even the city of Trilby, Florida, were named after her, as was the variety of soft felt hat with an indented crown worn in the London stage dramatisation of the novel. The plot inspired Gaston Leroux&#x27;s 1910 novel &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; and innumerable works derived from it. Du Maurier eventually came to dislike the persistent attention the novel was given.

The third novel was a long, largely autobiographical work entitled &quot;The Martian&quot;, published posthumously in 1898.

==Death and legacy==

Du Maurier died on 8 October 1896 and was buried in St John-at-Hampstead churchyard in Hampstead. The success of his writings and illustrations allowed du Maurier to leave a then staggering amount of £47,555 in his will.

Du Maurier was a close friend of Henry James, the novelist; their relationship was fictionalised in David Lodge&#x27;s &quot;Author, Author&quot; (2004).

<text>Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day, also called the Feast of Saint Stephen, is a Christian saint&#x27;s day to commemorate Saint Stephen, the first Christian martyr or protomartyr, celebrated on 26 December in Western Christianity and 27 December in Eastern Christianity. The Eastern Orthodox churches that adhere to the Julian calendar mark Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day on 27 December according to that calendar, which places it on 9 January of the Gregorian calendar used in civil contexts. In Western Christian denominations, Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day marks the second day of Christmastide.

It is an official public holiday in Alsace-Moselle, Austria, the Balearic Islands, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Catalonia, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Madeira, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Ukraine, Switzerland and Newfoundland. The date is also a public holiday in those countries that celebrate Boxing Day on the day in addition to or instead of Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day, such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom.

In the Isle of Man and in parts of Ireland, it is also known as Wren Day. It was traditional to hunt a wren, which would be paraded around the neighbourhood on top of a staff decorated with holly, ivy and ribbons.

==History==

Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day is the second day of Christmastide and is celebrated in honour of one of the first Christian martyrs, Saint Stephen, who was stoned to death in 36 AD.

==Celebrations by country==
===Ireland===

In the Republic of Ireland, Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day () is one of ten official public holidays. Its name is sometimes shortened to &quot;Stephen&#x27;s Day&quot; (), particularly in informal contexts.

Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day is also called Wren Day () in parts of Ireland. Traditionally, men and boys hunted a wren and placed it on top of a staff decorated with holly, ivy and ribbons. This was paraded around the neighbourhood by a group of &#x27;Wrenboys&#x27;—typically dressed in straw masks and costumes—who sang songs and played music in exchange for donations. Today, the wren is no longer hunted, but Wren Day has survived or been revived in a few towns, where groups of Wrenboys hold small parades and carry around a stuffed or fake wren.

A Mummer&#x27;s Festival is held at this time every year in the village of New Inn, County Galway, and Dingle in County Kerry. Mumming is also a big tradition in County Fermanagh. Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day is a popular day for visiting family members and going to the theatre to see a pantomime.

In most of Ulster in the north of Ireland, the day is usually known as Boxing Day, especially in Northern Ireland and County Donegal.

===Isle of Man===
Traditionally, a wren was hunted on the Isle of Man every Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day, like in Ireland. The wren&#x27;s body would be hung inside a frame of holly or ivy wreaths, called the &#x27;Wren Bush&#x27;, or displayed in a small decorated wooden box with windows, called the &#x27;Wren House&#x27;. These Wren Bushes or Wren Houses were held aloft on poles and taken around the neighbourhood by &#x27;Wrenboys&#x27;, some of whom were decked in greenery. Singing &quot;Hunt the Wren&quot; () and beating drums, they went from house to house asking for coins. At the end of the day, a funeral was held for the wren. Today, people sing and dance around a decorated Wren Bush or Wren Pole in which a stuffed or fake wren is placed.

===Wales===
Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day in Wales is known as &quot;&quot;, celebrated every year on 26 December. One ancient Welsh custom, discontinued in the 19th century, included bleeding of livestock and &quot;holming&quot; by beating with holly branches of late risers and female servants. The ceremony reputedly brought good luck.

===Catalonia, Balearic Islands (Spain)===
Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day (&#x27;) on 26 December is a holiday in Catalonia. It is traditionally celebrated with a festive meal that includes &#x27;. The pasta tubes are stuffed with ground meat that may include the leftovers of the previous day&#x27;s &#x27;, turkey, or &#x27;. In Catalan-speaking territories the day is also known as the Second Christmas Day or the &quot;Festa Mitjana&quot;. In the Valencia area a tradition is to eat with the mother&#x27;s side of the family on 25 December, and on the 26th with the father&#x27;s side. Historically, the Catalan holiday on the day after Christmas may be related to the practical need for time to return home after a Christmas Day gathering and may date back to the days of the Carolingian Empire.

===Italy===
Christmas in Italy is one of the country&#x27;s major holidays and begins on 8 December, with the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, the day on which traditionally the Christmas tree is mounted and ends on 6 January, of the following year with the Epiphany. In Italy, Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day became a public holiday in 1947, where previously it was a normal working day; the Catholic Church also celebrates it as a religious holiday, even if not as a precept, as it is in Germany and other German-speaking countries. The reason for the public holiday in Italy, not required by the Catholic Church despite the fame of the saint, is to be found in the intention of prolonging the Christmas holiday, creating two consecutive public holidays, which also happens in the case of Easter Monday, a non-religious holiday, but which only wants to lengthen Easter. Before 1947 the two days were working days, with banks and offices open.

===Alsace and Moselle===
Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day (&quot;) is marked as a public holiday as part of its shared culture across the Rhine River with Germany.

===Austria, Germany, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland===
&quot; is a public holiday in mainly Catholic Austria. In the Archdiocese of Vienna, the day of patron saint Saint Stephen is even celebrated on the feast of the Holy Family. Similar to the adjacent regions of Bavaria, numerous ancient customs still continued to this day, such as ceremonial horseback rides and blessing of horses, or the &quot;stoning&quot; drinking rite celebrated by young men after attending Mass.

The 26th of December is – as Second Day of Christmas (, , , ) – a public holiday in Poland, Germany, The Netherlands and the Czech Republic.

=== Hungary, Székely Transylvania, Csángó land ===
On this day, the men of the villages went to the girls&#x27; houses for a Stephen&#x27;s Day &quot;regélés&quot; (a custom that also appears in different versions at various times of the year). They wore sheepskin furs and used a bagpipe and a chained stick to make music. The ritual was also a fertility charm, a custom of ancient pagan origin. They told their good wishes, and sang songs to match the young, while the other boys asked for donations from the hosts and girls gave &quot;bokréta&quot;.

===Republika Srpska===
Saint Stephen is also the patron saint of Republika Srpska, one of two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina. St. Stephen&#x27;s Day, 9 January, is celebrated as the Day of the Republika Srpska or &quot;Dan Republike&quot;, though mainly as an anniversary of the 1992 events rather than as a religious feast.

===Finland===
The best-known tradition linked to the Stephen&#x27;s Day () is &quot;the ride of Stephen&#x27;s Day&quot; which refers to a sleigh ride with horses. These merry rides along village streets were seen in contrast to the silent and pious mood of the preceding Christmas days.

Another old tradition was parades with singers and people dressed in Christmas suits. At some areas these parades were related to checking forthcoming brides. Stephen&#x27;s Day used to be a popular day for weddings as well. These days a related tradition is dances of Stephen&#x27;s Day which are held in several restaurants and dance halls.

===Bulgaria===
In Bulgaria, the Orthodox Church celebrates Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day, also called Stefanov Den (), on the third day after Christmas - December 27. On this day, the ones who have a nameday are given gifts.

<doc id="202155" wikidata="Q460861" url="?curid=202155" title="John Cleland">
<text>Kingston upon Thames

John Cleland (24 September 1709 – 23 January 1789) was an English novelist best known for his fictional &quot;Fanny Hill: or, the Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure&quot;, whose eroticism led to his arrest. James Boswell called him &quot;a sly, old malcontent&quot;.

==Publication of &quot;Fanny Hill&quot;==
John Cleland began courting the Portuguese in a vain attempt to reestablish the Portuguese East India Company. In 1748, Cleland was arrested for an £840 debt (equivalent to a purchasing power of about £100,000 in 2005) and committed to Fleet Prison, where he remained for over a year. It was while he was in prison that Cleland finalised &quot;Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure.&quot; The text probably existed in manuscript for a number of years before Cleland developed it for publication. The novel was published in two instalments, in November 1748 and February 1749. In March of that year, he was released from prison.

However, Cleland was arrested again in November 1749, along with the publishers and printer of &quot;Fanny Hill.&quot; In court, Cleland disavowed the novel and said that he could only &quot;wish, from my Soul&quot;, that the book be &quot;buried and forgot&quot; (Sabor). The book was then officially withdrawn and not &quot;legally&quot; published again for over a hundred years. However, it continued to sell well in pirated editions. In March 1750, Cleland produced a highly bowdlerised version of the book, but it too was proscribed. Eventually, the prosecution against Cleland was dropped and the expurgated edition continued to sell legally.

==Later life==
None of Cleland&#x27;s literary works provided him with a comfortable living and he was typically bitter about this. He publicly denounced his mother before her death in 1763 for not supporting him. Additionally, he exhibited a religious tendency toward Deism that branded him as a heretic. Meanwhile he accused Laurence Sterne of &quot;pornography&quot; for &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;.

In 1772, he told Boswell that he had written &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; while in Bombay, that he had written it for a dare, to show a friend it was possible to write about prostitution without using &quot;vulgar&quot; terms. At the time, Boswell reported that Cleland was a &quot;fine, sly malcontent&quot;. Later, he would visit Cleland again and discover him living alone, shunned by all, with an &quot;ancient and ugly woman&quot; as his sole servant. Josiah Beckwith in 1781 said, after meeting him, that it was &quot;no wonder&quot; that he was thought to be a &quot;sodomite&quot;. From 1782 until his death on 23 January 1789 Cleland lived in Petty France, Westminster, near his childhood home in St James&#x27;s Place. He died unmarried and was buried in St Margaret&#x27;s churchyard in London.

==Composition of &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; and after==
Cleland&#x27;s account of when &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; was written is difficult. For one thing, the novel has allusions to other novels that were written and published the same year (including &quot;Shamela&quot;). Further, it takes part in the general Henry Fielding/Samuel Richardson battle, with &quot;Pamela: or, Virtue Rewarded&quot; on one side and &quot;Joseph Andrews&quot; on the other. Furthermore, the novel&#x27;s geography and topicality make a Bombay composition less likely than a Fleet Prison one. It is possible, of course, that a pornographic novel without vulgarity was written by Cleland in Bombay and then rewritten in Fleet Prison as a newly engaged and politically sophisticated novel.

Officially, &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; remained suppressed in an unexpurgated form until 1970 in the United Kingdom. However, in 1966 it became the subject of a US Supreme Court judgment &quot;A Book Named &quot;John Cleland&#x27;s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure&quot; v. Attorney General of Massachusetts&quot;, holding that under the US Constitution a modicum of merit precluded its condemnation as obscene. In fact, the novel is now regarded as a &quot;stylistic tour de force&quot; and as a participant in the &quot;making legible the bourgeois remapping of certain categories constitutive of &#x27;woman&#x27;, and then exposing that remapping as ludicrous&quot; (Gautier x). It has an exceptionally lively style, contains profoundly playful and ironic questions about womanhood, and has a satirical exposition of love as commerce and pleasure as wealth.

==&quot;Fanny Hill&quot; and homosexuality==
The fact that the passionate descriptions of copulatory acts in &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; are written by a man from the point of view of a woman, and the fact that Fanny is obsessed by phallic size, have led some critics to suggest it is a homoerotic work. That aspect of the novel, as well as Cleland&#x27;s presumed offence at Westminster School, lack of intimate friends and unmarried status, have aided conjecture that he was homosexual, as has his bitter falling out with friend Thomas Cannon, author of the pamphlet &quot;Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplify&#x27;d &quot;(1749), the earliest surviving published defence of homosexuality in English (Gladfelder).

The authorised edition of &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; also contains a scene where Fanny (to her disgust) comes across two teenage boys fornicating. The friendship of Cleland and Cannon was &quot;volatile, verging on murderous&quot;, but in the opinion of Gladfelder, who rediscovered the &quot;Ancient and Modern Pederasty...&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s no coincidence that they simultaneously produced the only two explicit accounts of male same-sex desire in English before the nineteenth century, published just a month apart in 1759.&quot; That may, however, simply reflect Cleland&#x27;s knowledge of his friend&#x27;s research and the opportunity to use it in a novel that had a rare explicitness for the time.

<doc id="202158" wikidata="Q45844" url="?curid=202158" title="Emperor Go-Sanjō">
<text>was the 71st emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. His given name was .

Go-Sanjō&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 1068 through 1073.

This 11th century sovereign was named after his grandfather Emperor Sanjō and &quot;go-&quot; (後), translates literally as &quot;later;&quot; and thus, he is sometimes called the &quot;Later Emperor Sanjō&quot;, or, in some older sources, may be identified as &quot;Sanjō, the second&quot; or as &quot;Sanjō II.&quot;

It was during, and due to, Go-Sanjo&#x27;s reign that the Fujiwara grip on power was broken; following Go-Sanjo&#x27;s rule, their power continued to wane until 1150, when any semblance of their power disappeared.

==Biography==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (諱, &quot;imina&quot;) was Takahito&quot;-shinnō&quot; (尊仁親王, たかひとしんのう).

Takahito&quot;-shinnō&quot; was the second son of Emperor Go-Suzaku. His mother was Empress (&quot;kōgō&quot;) Sadako (禎子内親王), the third daughter of Emperor Sanjō, making him the first Emperor in 170 years (since Emperor Uda) whose mother was not of Fujiwara descent paternally. His father and mother were grandchildren of Fujiwara no Michinaga maternally. The Empress mother of the future Emperor Go-Sanjō was also known as Teishi, and a Yōmei-mon In (1012–94). His lack of connection with the Fujiwara meant he owed them no special loyalty—meaning that he could afford to oppose them.

== Events of Go-Sanjō&#x27;s life ==
Because Prince Takahito was not of Fujiwara descent, the &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Fujiwara no Yorimichi neglected him, but Emperor Go-Suzaku decreed that upon his elder brother Chikahito&#x27;s enthronement (as Emperor Go-Reizei), that Takahito would become the heir (&quot;kōtaitei&quot;). As Emperor Go-Reizei had no children of his own, upon his death, Takahito became emperor.

* May 22, 1068 (&quot;Jiryaku 4, 19th day of the 4th month&quot;): In the 4th year of Emperor Go-Reizei&#x27;s reign (後冷泉天皇四年), he died at age 44; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his younger half-brother. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Sanjo is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

Yorimichi&#x27;s younger brother Norimichi became &quot;kampaku&quot;, but Go-Sanjō was determined to rule personally.

* 1069 (&quot;Enkyū 1&quot;): Go-Sanjō issued the &quot;Enkyū&quot; Shōen Regulation Decree (Enkyū is the name of the era in which the decree was issued); and the emperor called for the establishment of a government office to certify Shōen records.
* 1070 (&quot;Enkyū 2&quot;): Go-Sanjō ordered a preliminary system of laws and a bureaucracy for regulating silk.
* 1072 (&quot;Enkyū 4&quot;): As the Ritsuryō system of centralized authority had largely failed by this time, Go-Sanjō became interested in strengthening the finances of the Imperial Household.
* January 18, 1073 (&quot;Enkyū 4, 8th day of the 12th month&quot;): In the 6th year of Emperor Go-Sanjō&#x27;s reign (桓武天皇六年), the emperor abdicated in favor of his son, and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his son. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Shirakawa is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).
* May 11, 1073 (&quot;Enkyū 5, 21st day of the 4th month&quot;): Go-Sanjō entered the Buddhist priesthood; and his new priestly name became Kongō-gyō.
* June 15, 1073 (&quot;Enkyū 5, 7th day of the 5th month&quot;): The former-Emperor Go-Sanjō died at the age of 40.
Go-Sanjō is buried amongst the &quot;Seven Imperial Tombs&quot; at Ryōan-ji in Kyoto.

The actual site of Go-Sanjō&#x27;s grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Kyoto.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Go-Sanjō&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Yensō-ji no misasagi&quot;.

The mound which commemorates the Hosokawa Emperor Go-Sanjō is today named &quot;Shu-zan&quot;. The emperor&#x27;s burial place would have been quite humble in the period after Go-Sanjō died.

These tombs reached their present state as a result of the 19th century restoration of imperial sepulchers (&quot;misasagi&quot;) which were ordered by Emperor Meiji.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Go-Sanjō&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included: 
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Fujiwara Norimichi (997–1075).
* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot;, Fujiwara Norimichi.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Fujiwara Morozone, 1042–1101.
* &quot;Udaijin,&quot; Minamoto no Morofusa
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Go-Sanjō&#x27;s reign==
The years of Go-Sanjō&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Jiryaku&quot; (1065–1069)
* &quot;Enkyū&quot; (1069–1074)

==Consorts==
