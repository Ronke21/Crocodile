<text>This is a list of sailing [[frigate]]s of the [[United States Navy]]. Frigates were the backbone of the early Navy, although the list shows that many suffered unfortunate fates.

The sailing frigates of the United States built from 1797 on were unique in that their framing was made of American live oak, a particularly hardy genus that made very resilient hulls; as a result of this, the ships were known to withstand damage that would have scuppered frigates of other nations. American frigates were also very heavily armed; the USN&#x27;s 44s carried 24-pound cannon as opposed to the 18-pounders usual in frigates, and like most ships of the period carried more than their nominal rate, 56 guns or more. On the other hand, the USN classed ships with 20 to 26 guns as &quot;third-class frigates&quot;, whereas the Royal Navy did not.

==Continental Navy==
Congress authorized 3 frigates of 18, 13 frigates of 12 ( 5 of 32, 5 of 28 and 3 of 24)

==United States Navy==
:Ten additional ships of the &quot;Potomac&quot; class were appropriated, but never built.

<doc id="208636" wikidata="Q1674170" url="?curid=208636" title="Turkistan Islamic Party">
<text>The Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP) is an Uyghur Islamist militant organization founded in Pakistan by Hasan Mahsum. Its stated goals are to establish an Islamic state in Xinjiang and Central Asia.

The Chinese government asserts that the TIP is synonymous with the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM). ETIM has been described by scholars as demanding total independence and supporting or being indifferent to more radical methods driven by religious and ethnic motives.

Influenced by the success of the Afghan mujahideen against the Soviets in the Soviet–Afghan War, the ETIP (later become known as TIP in 2001) was established in September 1997 by Hasan Mahsum in Pakistan. After the September 11 attacks, the Chinese regime strove to include its repression of Uyghur opposition within the international dynamic of the struggle against Islamic terrorist networks. Their slogans contained anti-Communist rhetoric and calls for uniting Turks, indicating a movement akin to Islamic pan-Turkism historically congruent with southern Xinjiang rather than pure, radical Salafi jihadism or religious extremism. The revolt lasted several days and was put down by the Chinese government, which deployed significant forces to suppress the insurrection. The Chinese government viewed them as a jihadist movement akin to the mujahideen in Afghanistan across the border which gave birth to more radical movements such as the Party of Allah and the Islamic Movement of East Turkistan.

The Syrian branch of the TIP was active in the Syrian civil war and were largely grouped in Idlib. The Syrian branch dissolved following the fall of Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s regime and was incorporated into the newly formed Ministry of Defense.

== History ==
===Earlier groups===
Abdul Hameed, Abdul Azeez Makhdoom and Abdul Hakeem Makhdoom launched the &quot;Hizbul Islam Li-Turkestan&quot; (Islamic Party of Turkistan or Turkistan Islamic Movement) in 1940. They were killed, imprisoned or driven underground by the China by the late 1950s. After being set free from prison in 1979, Abdul Hakeem Makhdoom instructed Muhammad Amin Jan and other Uyghurs in his version of Islam.

===Founding===
The East Turkistan Islamic Party (ETIP) was organised in Pakistan by Hasan Mahsum and Abudukadir Yapuquan in September 1997. In 1998, Mahsum moved the ETIP (which China claims is the ETIM)&#x27;s headquarters to Kabul, taking shelter under Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. The leader, Hasan Mahsum, was killed by a Pakistani raid on a suspected Al-Qaeda camp in South Waziristan in 2003, leading to the group&#x27;s collapse.

However, ETIP resurged after the Iraq War inflamed mujaheddin sentiment. The group was mentioned again in 2007, when China announced it raided its militants in Akto County. ETIM received material support from the Taliban and had links to the Pakistani Taliban (Tehreek i Taliban Pakistan), prompting China to urge Pakistan to take action against the militants in 2009.

===From ETIP to TIP===
The new organization called itself the Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP) to reflect its new domain and abandoned usage of the name ETIP, although China still calls it by the name ETIM. The Turkistan Islamic Party was originally subordinated to the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) but then split off and declared its name as TIP and started making itself known by promoting itself with its &quot;Islamic Turkistan&quot; magazine and Voice of Islam media in Chinese, Arabic, Russian, and Turkish in order to reach out to global jihadists. Control over the Uyghur and Uzbek militants was transferred to the Pakistani Taliban from the Afghan Taliban after 2001, so violence against the militant&#x27;s countries of origins can no longer restrained by the Afghan Taliban since the Pakistani Taliban does not have a stake in doing so.

In 2013, the group announced it was moving fighters to Syria, its profile in China and even Afghanistan and Pakistan has decisively waned since then, while in Syria it has risen.

===Al-Qaeda links===
The TIP has links to al-Qaeda and affiliated groups such as the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, and the Pakistani Taliban. The US has designated it as having received &quot;training and financial assistance&quot; from al-Qaeda.

University of Virginia associate professor Philip B. K. Potter wrote in 2013 that, even though &quot;throughout the 1990s, Chinese authorities went to great lengths to publicly link organizations active in Xinjiang—particularly the ETIM—to al-Qaeda [...] the best information indicates that before 2001, the relationship included some training and funding but relatively little operational cooperation.&quot; Meanwhile, specific incidents were downplayed by Chinese authorities as isolated criminal acts. However, in 1998 the group&#x27;s headquarters were moved to Kabul, in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, while &quot;China&#x27;s ongoing security crackdown in Xinjiang has forced the most militant Uyghur separatists into volatile neighboring countries, such as Pakistan,&quot; Potter writes, &quot;where they are forging strategic alliances with, and even leading, jihadist factions affiliated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban.&quot;

However, according to the US Treasury, TIP member Abdul Haq al-Turkistani joined al-Qaeda&#x27;s Majlis-ash-Shura (executive leadership council) in 2005 and TIP member Abdul Shakoor Turkistani was appointed military commander of its forces in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan. Abdul Haq was considered sufficiently influential by the al-Qaeda leadership that he served as a mediator between rival Taliban factions and played a role in military planning.

In the mid-2010s, TIP&#x27;s relationship to al-Qaeda was still contested but they became more closely aligned and TIP leader head Abdul Haq confirmed loyalty to al-Qaeda in May 2016. In 2014, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, the al-Qaeda aligned al-Fajr Media Center began to distribute TIP promotional material, placing it in the &quot;jihadist mainstream&quot;. The East Turkestan independence movement was endorsed in the serial &quot;Islamic Spring&quot;&#x27;s 9th release by Ayman Al-Zawahiri in 2016. Zawahiri confirmed that the Afghanistan war after 9/11 included the participation of Uighurs and that the jihadists like Zarwaqi, Bin Ladin and the Uighur Hasan Mahsum were provided with refuge together in Afghanistan under Taliban rule. This was before the Bishkek Chinese Embassy Bombing. The Turkistan Islamic Party slammed and attacked Assad, Russia, NATO, the United States and other western countries in its propaganda outlets such as the &quot;Islamic Turkestan&quot; magazine and its Telegram channel.

===Afghanistan and Waziristan===
In February 2018, airstrikes were conducted by American forces in Afghanistan&#x27;s Badakhshan province against training camps belonging to the Taliban and the Turkistan Islamic Party. Speaking with Pentagon reporters, US Air Force Maj. Gen. James B. Hecker, commander of NATO Air Command Afghanistan was quoted &quot;The destruction of these training facilities prevents terrorists from planning any acts near the border with China and Tajikistan. The strikes also destroyed stolen Afghan National Army vehicles in the process of being converted to vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices. ETIM enjoys support from the Taliban in the mountains of Badakhshan, so hitting these Taliban training facilities and squeezing the Taliban&#x27;s support networks degrades ETIM capabilities.&quot;

After the 2021 Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, TIP was removed from Badakhshan, as the new Afghan government seeks aid from China.

===Syria===
TIP (ETIM) sent the &quot;Turkistan Brigade&quot; (Katibat Turkistani), also known as the Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria to take part in the Syrian Civil War as part of a network of al-Qaeda linked groups alongside al-Nusra, most notably in the 2015 Jisr al-Shughur offensive where they were part of the Army of Conquest coalition. They have been described as well organized, experienced and as having an important role in offensives against President Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s forces in Syria&#x27;s northern regions. On 29 January 2025, after the fall of Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s regime, most factions of the armed opposition including the Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria announced their dissolution and were incorporated into the newly formed Ministry of Defense.

== Ideology ==
The NEFA Foundation, an American terrorist analyst foundation, translated and released a jihad article from ETIM, whose membership it said consisted primarily of &quot;Uyghur Muslims from Western China.&quot; The TIP&#x27;s primary goal is the independence of East Turkestan. ETIM continues this theme of contrasting &quot;Muslims&quot; and &quot;Chinese&quot;, in a six-minute video in 2008, where &quot;Commander Seyfullah&quot; warns Muslims not to bring their children to the 2008 Summer Olympics, and also saying &quot;do not stay on the same bus, on the same train, on the same plane, in the same buildings, or any place the Chinese are&quot;.

== Structure ==
TIP is led by Abdul Haq al-Turkistani, who&#x27;s the group&#x27;s Emir and leader of the Shura Council. The Council also includes a Deputy Emir, and the heads of at least three groups: Religious Education Division, Military Affairs Division and Information Center. There have also been reports of a Intelligence Division and a Logistics Division.

=== Media ===
In 2008, TIP&#x27;s &quot;Ṣawt al-Islām&quot; (Voice of Islam) media arm was created and began releasing video messages. The full name of their media center is &quot;Turkistan Islamic Party Voice of Islam Media Center&quot; ().

=== Members ===
In October 2008, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security released a list of eight terrorists linked to ETIM, including some of the leadership, with detailed charges. They are:
== Guantanamo Bay detainees ==


The United States captured 22 Uyghur militants from combat zones in Afghanistan in 2006 on information that they were linked to Al-Qaeda. They were imprisoned without trial for five to seven years, where they testified that they were trained by ETIM leader Abdul Haq, at an ETIM training camp. After being found No Longer Enemy Combatant, i.e. never having been enemy combatants, a panel of judges ordered them released into the United States. Despite the alarm of politicians that the release of embittered former Guantanamo detainees into the United States was unsafe and illegal, the United States did not want to release them back to China as they were wanted on charges that included arson and illegal manufacture of explosives, though &quot;ABC News&quot; wrote that &quot;It is believed that if the United States returned the men to China, they could be tortured.&quot;

==Attacks and incidents==

* Between 1990 and 2001, Chinese government has attributed many different Uyghur groups including ETIP, after 1997, to over 200 acts of terrorism, which claimed 162 lives and over 440 injured. However, in many Chinese official statements &quot;east Turkestan terrorist forces&quot; are referred to rather than any specific group.
* Between 1992 and 1998, four imams of mosques in Xinjiang were assassinated by different East Turkistan groups .
* In 2007, ETIP militants in cars shot Chinese nationals in Pakistani Balochistan, which Pakistani authorities believed to be in retaliation for an execution of an ETIM official earlier that July. 
* ETIM also took credit for a spate of attacks before the 2008 Summer Olympics, including a series of bus bombings in Kunming, an attempted plane hijacking in Urumqi, and an attack on paramilitary troops in Kashgar that killed 17 officers.
* On 29 June 2010, a court in Dubai convicted two members of an ETIM cell for plotting to bomb a government-owned shopping mall that sold Chinese goods. This was the first ETIM plot outside of China or Central Asia. The key plotter was recruited during Hajj and was flown to Waziristan for training.
* In July 2010, officials in Norway interrupted a terrorist bomb plot; one perpetrator was Uyghur, leading to speculation about TIP involvement. &quot;New York Times&quot; correspondent Edward Wong says that ETIM &quot;give[s] them a &quot;&quot; at a time when the Chinese government has... defused any chance of a widespread insurgency... in Xinjiang.&quot;
* Several attacks in 2011 in Xinjiang were claimed by the Turkistan Islamic Party.
* In October 2013, a suicide attack in Tiananmen Square caused 5 deaths and 38 injuries. Chinese police described it as the first terrorist attack in Beijing&#x27;s recent history. Turkistan Islamic Party later claimed responsibility for the attack.
* In March 2014, a knife-armed group attacked passengers at the Kunming&#x27;s railway station, resulting in 31 civilians dead and +140 injured. No group claimed responsibility. Chinese authorities and state media stated that the attack had been linked to TIP, while other sources were skeptical of this claim.
*Between July and December 2014, a series of riots, bombings, arson and knife attacks in Xinjiang which led to the deaths over 183 people (including civilians, attackers and security forces) and left dozens injured. Chinese authorities attributed attacks to &quot;gangs&quot; and &quot;terrorists&quot;.
* Assassination of Juma Tayir, a government-appointed Imam in Id Kah mosque was attributed to by the Chinese government to TIP-inspired militants.
* On 18 September 2015 in Aksu, a group of knife-wielding terrorists attacked sleeping workers at a coalmine and killed 16 of them. The Turkistan Islamic Party claimed responsibility for the attack.
* On 30 August 2016, the Chinese Embassy in Kyrgyzstan was targeted in a suicide bombing which left Kyrgyz staffers injured; the attack was later attributed by Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s state security service to TIP.
*On 14 February 2017, attackers killed 5 people in Pishan county before killed by police. Chinese authorities stated that the attackers were affiliated with TIP.
*On 14 July 2021, an attack killed 13 people, including 9 Chinese engineers who were working on the Dasu Dam in Kohistan, Pakistan. Asia Times reported that a &quot;joint China-Pakistan investigation&quot; showed ETIM and TTP colluded in the attack, but Reuters and Al Jazeera reported that Pakistan blamed the TTP, with support from Afghan and Indian intelligence services, without mentioning ETIM. The claims were denied by both the Indian government and TTP.

==Terrorist designation==
Since the September 11 attacks, the group has been designated as a terrorist organization by the following countries and international organizations:
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
Former:

* The ETIM was formerly classified as a terrorist organization under Title 8 of the United States Code Section 1189 by the United States from 2002 to 2020. The United States Department of the Treasury confiscated the organization&#x27;s property and prohibited transactions with it according to Executive Order 13224, while the State Department blocked its members from entering the country. The US revoked that classification for the ETIM in October 2020 on the basis that &quot;there has been no credible evidence that ETIM continues to exist.&quot; The U.S. State Department however continues to view the Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP) as a terrorist organization. A State Department Spokesperson told &quot;Newsweek&quot; that &quot;Uyghur terrorists fighting in Syria and Afghanistan are members of the Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP),&quot; and that is &quot;a separate organization that China and others have incorrectly identified as ETIM.&quot; China accused the US of double standards as it dropped ETIM from its terrorism list, while the US contends that the label has been broadly misused to oppress Muslims in Xinjiang.

==Analysis==
In 2009, Dru C. Gladney, an authority on research on ethnic and cultural nationalism in Asia, said that there was &quot;a credibility gap&quot; about the group since the majority of information on ETIM &quot;was traced back to Chinese sources&quot;, and that some believe ETIM to be part of a US-China quid pro quo, where China supported the US-led War on Terror, and &quot;support of the US for the condemnation of ETIM was connected to that support.&quot; The Uyghur American Association has publicly doubted the ETIM&#x27;s existence.

Andrew McGregor, writing for the Jamestown Foundation in 2010, noted that &quot;though there is no question a small group of Uyghur militants fought alongside their Taliban hosts against the Northern Alliance [...] the scores of terrorists Beijing claimed that Bin Laden was sending to China in 2002 never materialized&quot; and that &quot;the TIP&#x27;s &#x27;strategy&#x27; of making loud and alarming threats (attacks on the Olympics, use of biological and chemical weapons, etc.) without any operational follow-up has been enormously effective in promoting China&#x27;s efforts to characterize Uyghur separatists as terrorists.&quot;

On 16 June 2009, US Representative Bill Delahunt convened hearings to examine how organizations were added to the US blacklist in general, and how the ETIM was added in particular. Uyghur expert Sean Roberts testified that the ETIM was new to him, that it wasn&#x27;t until it was blacklisted that he heard of the group, and claimed that &quot;it is perfectly reasonable to assume that the organization no longer exists at all.&quot; The Congressional Research Service reported that the first published mention of the group was in the year 2000, but that China attributed attacks to it that had occurred up to a decade earlier.

Stratfor has noted repeated unexplained attacks on Chinese buses in 2008 have followed a history of ETIM targeting Chinese infrastructure, and noted the group&#x27;s splintering and subsequent reorganization following the death of Mahsum.

In 2010, intelligence analysts J. Todd Reed and Diana Raschke acknowledge that reporting in China presents obstacles not found in countries where information is not so tightly controlled. However, they found that ETIM&#x27;s existence and activities could be confirmed independently of Chinese government sources, using information gleaned from ETIM&#x27;s now-defunct website, reports from human rights groups and academics, and testimony from the Uyghur detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Reed &amp; Raschke also question the information put out by Uyghur expatriates that deny ETIM&#x27;s existence or impact, as the Uyghurs who leave Xinjiang are those who object most to government policy, are unable to provide first-hand analysis, and have an incentive to exaggerate repression and downplay militancy. They say that ETIM was &quot;obscure but not unknown&quot; before the September 11 attacks, citing &quot;Western, Russian, and Chinese media sources&quot; that have &quot;documented the ETIM&#x27;s existence for nearly 20 years&quot;.

In 2010, Raffaello Pantucci of Jamestown Foundation wrote about the convictions of two men linked to a ETIM cell in Dubai with a plot to attack a shopping mall.

Nick Holdstock, in a 2015 &quot;New York Times&quot; interview, said that no organization is taking responsibility for attacks in Xinjiang, and that there is not enough proof to blame any organization for the attacks, that most &quot;terrorism&quot; there is &quot;unsubstantiated&quot;, and that posting internet videos online is the only thing done by the &quot;vague and shadowy&quot; ETIM.

In 2016, David Volodzko wrote that the Al-Qaeda allied Uyghur Turkistan Islamic Party members were fighting in Syria, and refuted and disproved the claims that Uyghurs were not in Syria made by &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, the Daily Mail, and Bernstein&#x27;s article in the New York Review of Books.

Muhanad Hage Ali wrote on Uyghur Turkistan Islamic Party jihadists in Syria for Al Arabiya.

In 2019, Uran Botobekov from &quot;ModernDiplomat&quot; has written about the Turkistan Islamic Party along with other Central-Asian jihadist groups in a report titled &quot;Think like Jihadist: Anatomy of Central Asian Salafi groups&quot;.

<text>Selim III (; ; 24 December 1761 – 28 July 1808) was the sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1789 to 1807. Regarded as an enlightened ruler, he was eventually deposed and imprisoned by the Janissaries, who placed his cousin Mustafa on the throne as Mustafa IV (). A group of assassins subsequently killed Selim.

==Early life ==

Selim III was the son of Sultan Mustafa III and his wife Mihrişah Sultan. His mother, Mihrişah Sultan, originated in Georgia, and when she became the Valide sultan, she participated in reforming the government schools and establishing political corporations. His father, Ottoman Sultan Mustafa III, was very well educated and believed in the necessity of reforms. Mustafa III attempted to create a powerful army with professional, well-educated soldiers during peacetime. This was primarily motivated by his fear of a Russian invasion. During the Russo-Turkish War, he fell ill and died of a heart attack in 1774. Sultan Mustafa was aware of the fact that a military reform was necessary. He declared new military regulations and opened maritime and artillery academies.

Sultan Mustafa was significantly influenced by mysticism. An oracle predicted his son Selim would be a world conqueror, so he organized a seven-day joyous feast. Selim was very well educated in the palace. Sultan Mustafa III named his son his successor; however, Selim&#x27;s uncle Abdul Hamid I ascended the throne after Mustafa&#x27;s death. Sultan Abdul Hamid I took care of Selim and emphasized his education.

After Abdul Hamid&#x27;s death, Selim succeeded him on 7 April 1789, at the age of 27. Sultan Selim III was very fond of literature and calligraphy; many of his works were put on the walls of mosques and convents. He wrote many poems, especially about Crimea&#x27;s occupation by Russia. He spoke Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Old Bulgarian fluently. Selim III showed great importance to patriotism and religion. He demonstrated his poetry and music skills and was fond of fine arts and the army.

==Reign==

=== Plans of reforms ===

The talents and energy with which Selim III was endowed had endeared him to the people, and great hopes were founded on his accession. He had associated much with foreigners and was thoroughly persuaded of the necessity of reforming his state.

However, Austria and Russia gave him no time for anything but defense, and it was not until the Peace of Iaşi (1792) that breathing space was allowed him in Europe, while Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Egypt and Syria soon called for the empire&#x27;s most vigorous efforts.

Ottoman provinces from Egypt to Syria began implementing French policies and differed away from Istanbul after Napoleon&#x27;s attack.

Selim III profited by the respite to abolish the military tenure of fiefs; he introduced salutary reforms into the administration, especially in the fiscal department, sought by well-considered plans to extend the spread of education, and engaged foreign officers as instructors, by whom a small corps of new troops called &quot;Nizam-I Cedid&quot; were collected and drilled in 1797. This unit comprised Turkish peasant youths from Anatolia and was supplied with modern weaponry.

These troops were able to hold their own against rebellious Janissaries in the Balkan provinces such as the Sanjak of Smederevo against its appointed Vizier Hadži Mustafa Pasha, where disaffected governors made no scruple of attempting to make use of them against the reforming sultan.

Emboldened by this success, Selim III issued an order that in the future, picked men should be taken annually from the Janissaries to serve in the &quot;Nizam-I Cedid&quot;. Selim III was unable to integrate the Nizam-I Cedid with the rest of the army which overall limited its role in defense of the state.

=== Foreign relations ===
Selim III ascended the throne only to find that the Ottoman Empire of old had been considerably reduced due to conflicts outside the realm. In the north, Russia had taken the Black Sea through the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca in 1774. Selim realized the importance of diplomatic relations with other nations and pushed for permanent embassies in the courts of all the great nations of Europe, a hard task because of religious prejudice towards Muslims. Even with the religious obstacles, resident embassies were established in Britain, France, Prussia and Austria. Selim, a cultured poet and musician, carried on an extended correspondence with Louis XVI. Although distressed by the establishment of the republic in France, the Ottoman government was soothed by French representatives in Constantinople who maintained the goodwill of various influential personages.

On 1 July 1798, however, French forces landed in Egypt, and Selim declared war on France. In alliance with Russia and Britain, the Turks were in periodic conflict with the French on land and sea until March 1801. Peace came in June 1802, but the following year brought new trouble in the Balkans. For decades, a sultan&#x27;s word had had no power in outlying provinces, prompting Selim&#x27;s reforms of the military to reimpose central control. This desire was not fulfilled. One rebellious leader was Austrian-backed Osman Pazvantoğlu, whose invasion of Wallachia in 1801 inspired Russian intervention, resulting in greater autonomy for the Danubian provinces. Serbian conditions also deteriorated. They took a fateful turn with the return of the hated Janissaries, ousted eight years before. These forces murdered Selim&#x27;s enlightened governor, ending this province&#x27;s best rule in the last 100 years. Neither arms nor diplomacy could restore Ottoman authority.

French influence with the &quot;Sublime Porte&quot; (the European diplomatic designation of the Ottoman state) did not revive. Still, it led the Sultan to defy St. Petersburg and London, and Turkey joined Napoleon&#x27;s Continental System. War was declared on Russia on 27 December and on Britain in March 1807.

=== Janissary revolt ===
The Sultan&#x27;s most ambitious military project was the creation of an entirely new infantry corps fully trained and equipped according to the latest European standards. This unit called the &quot;Nizam-I Cedid&quot; (the new order), was formed in 1797 and adopted a pattern of recruitment that was uncommon for the imperial forces; it was composed of Turkish peasant youths from Anatolia, a clear indication that the &quot;devshirme&quot; system was no longer functional. Officered and trained by Europeans, the &quot;Nizam-I Cedid&quot; was outfitted with modern weapons and French-style uniforms. By 1806, the new army numbered around 23,000 troops, including a modern artillery corps, and its units performed effectively in minor actions. But Selim III&#x27;s inability to integrate the force with the regular army and his reluctance to deploy it against his domestic opponents limited its role in defending the state it was created to preserve.

From the start of Selim&#x27;s reign, the Janissaries had viewed this entire military reform program as a threat to their independence, and they refused to serve alongside the new army in the field. The powerful &quot;derebeys&quot; were alarmed by how the sultan financed his new forces—he confiscated &quot;timars&quot; and directed the other revenue toward the &quot;Nizam-I Cedid&quot;. Further opposition came from the ulama and other ruling elite members who objected to the European models on which Selim based his military reforms.

Led by the rebellious Janissaries, these forces came together in 1806, deposed Selim III, and selected a successor, Mustafa IV, who pledged not to interfere with their privileges. The decree of deposition accused Selim III of failing to respect Islam&#x27;s religion and the Ottomans&#x27; tradition. Over the next year, the embassies in Europe were dismantled, the &quot;Nizam-I Cedid&quot; troops were dispersed, and the deposed sultan, whose cautious military reforms were intended to do no more than preserve the tradition of the Ottomans, was murdered.

===Austro-Turkish War (1788–91)===
The Austro-Turkish War (1788–1791) was an inconclusive struggle between the Austrian and Ottoman Empires. It took place at the same time as the Russo-Turkish War of 1787-1792, during the reign of the Ottoman Sultan Selim III.

=== Russo-Turkish war ===
The first major Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774) began after Turkey demanded that Russia&#x27;s ruler, Catherine II the Great, abstain from interfering in Poland&#x27;s internal affairs. The Russians went on to win impressive victories over the Turks. They captured Azov, the Crimea, and Bessarabia, and under Field Marshal Pyotr Rumyantsev, they overran Moldavia and also defeated the Turks in Bulgaria. The Turks were compelled to seek peace, concluding in the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. This treaty made the Crimean khanate independent of the Turkish sultan and advanced the Russian frontier. Russia was now in a much stronger position to expand, and in 1783 Catherine annexed the Crimean Peninsula outright.

War broke out in 1787, with Austria again on the side of Russia. Under General Alexander Suvorov, the Russians won several victories that gave them control of the lower Dniester and Danube rivers, and further Russian successes compelled the Turks to sign the Treaty of Jassy on 9 January 1792. Turkey ceded the entire western Ukrainian Black Sea coast to Russia by this treaty. When Turkey deposed the Russophile governors of Moldavia and Walachia in 1806, war broke out again, though in a desultory fashion since Russia was reluctant to concentrate large forces against Turkey while its relations with Napoleonic France were so uncertain. But in 1811, with the prospect of a war between France and Russia in sight, the latter sought a quick decision on its southern frontier. The Russian field marshal Mikhail Kutuzov’s victorious campaign of 1811–12 forced the Turks to sign the Treaty of Bucharest on 18 May 1812. Ending the war that had begun in 1806, this peace agreement established the Ottoman cession of Bessarabia to Russia.

The Russians also secured amnesty and a promise of autonomy for the Serbs, who had rebelled against Turkish rule, but Turkish garrisons were given control of the Serbian fortresses. Several disputes forestalled the treaty&#x27;s implementation, and Turkish troops invaded Serbia again the following year.

===Relations with Tipu Sultan===

Tipu Sultan was an independent ruler of the Sultanate of Mysore, with high regard for loyalty to the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II. He had urgently requested Ottoman assistance during the Third Anglo-Mysore War, in which he had suffered an irreversible defeat. Tipu Sultan then began to consolidate his relations with France. In an attempt to support and open a route to link up with Tipu Sultan, Napoleon invaded Ottoman Egypt in the year 1798, causing a furor in Constantinople.

The British then appealed to Selim III to send a letter to Tipu Sultan requesting the Sultanate of Mysore to halt its state of war against the British East India Company. Selim III then wrote a letter to Tipu Sultan criticizing the French and also informed Tipu Sultan that the Ottomans would act as an intermediary between the Sultanate of Mysore and the British. Tipu Sultan wrote twice to Selim III, rejecting the advice of the Ottomans; before most of his letters could arrive in Constantinople, the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War broke out and Tipu Sultan was killed during the Siege of Seringapatam (1799).

===Alcohol prohibition===

Many Ottoman sultans imposed alcohol bans (often with limited success). Despite Selim III&#x27;s hardline stance on alcohol consumption and threats to execute Christians and Jews caught selling wine or &quot;rakı&quot; to Muslims, it proved extremely difficult to curtail alcohol consumption in Istanbul, where wines were locally produced, and the city had many established wine-houses serving its non-Muslim residents.

== 1806 Edirne Incident ==
The 1806 Edirne Incident was an armed confrontation between the New Order Troops (&quot;Nizam-I Cedid&quot;) of Ottoman Sultan Selim III and a coalition of Balkan magnates, the ayans, and the region&#x27;s Janissary garrisons that occurred in Thrace throughout the summer of 1806. The cause of the incident was Selim III&#x27;s attempt to expand the New Order&#x27;s permanent presence into Rumelia by establishing New Order barracks in the region&#x27;s cities. The outcome of the confrontation was the retreat of imperial forces to Istanbul and Anatolia, which constituted a death blow to Selim III&#x27;s ambitions of expanding his reformed army and a major blow to his legitimacy. This deteriorated image would result in his deposition the following May.

== Downfall and assassination ==

Selim III was, however, thoroughly under the influence of French ambassador to the Porte Horace Sébastiani, and the fleet was compelled to retire without effecting its purpose. However, the anarchy, manifest or latent, existing throughout the provinces proved too great for Selim III to cope with. The Janissaries rose once more in revolt, induced the Sheikh ul-Islam to grant a fatwa against the reforms, dethroned and imprisoned Selim III, and placed his cousin Mustafa on the throne, as Mustafa IV (1807–08), on 29 May 1807.

The ayan of Rustchuk, Alemdar Mustafa, a strong partisan of the reforms, collected an army of 40,000 men and marched on Constantinople to reinstate Selim III, but he came too late. The ill-fated reforming sultan had been stabbed in the seraglio by the Chief Black Eunuch and his men. Upon his arrival in the capital, Bairakdar&#x27;s only resource was to wreak his vengeance on Mustafa IV and to place on the throne Mahmud II (1808–1839), the sole surviving member of the House of Osman.

Another version about his murder states that at the time of his deposition, Selim was staying at the Harem. The night of Thursday, 28 July 1808, he was with two of his consorts, Refet Kadın and Pakize Hanım. Alemdar Mustafa Pasha, a loyalist of Selim, was approaching the city with his army to reinstate Selim. Therefore, Mustafa IV gave orders to murder him and his brother Prince Mahmud.

The assassins were a group of men, including the Master of the Wardrobe, Fettah the Georgian, the Treasury steward Ebe Selim, and a black eunuch named Nezir Ağa. Selim knew his end was coming when he saw their swords drawn. Pakize Hanım threw herself between them and her lord; she was cut in her hand. Refet Kadın started screaming in terror, and another slave girl who rushed in fainted when she saw what was about to happen. A struggle ensued, and the former sultan was cut down and murdered, his last words being &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; (&quot;God is great&quot;).

Refet Kadın threw herself on the body but was dragged away. The body was quickly wrapped in a quilt. The assassins moved on to find Prince Mahmud and attempted to murder him. He was more fortunate and later ordered the assassins to be executed. Selim III would be the only Ottoman sultan killed by a sword. He was buried in Laleli Mosque near his father&#x27;s tomb.

== Interest in poetry and arts ==

A great music lover, Sultan Selim III was a composer and performer of significant talent. He created fourteen &quot;makams&quot; (melodic types), three of which are in current use today. Sixty-four compositions by Selim III are known today, some of which are part of the regular repertory of Turkish classical music performance. Aside from composing music, Selim III also performed on the ney (reed flute) and tanbur (long-necked, fretted lute).

Selim III&#x27;s interest in music started in his days as a prince when he studied under Kırımlı Ahmet Kamil Efendi and Tanburi İzak Efendi. He was exceptionally respectful of Tanburi İzak Efendi, and it is recounted that the Sultan rose in respect when Tanburi İzak Efendi entered the court.

As a patron of the arts, Selim III encouraged musicians of his day, including Dede Efendi and Baba Hamparsum. The Hamparsum notation system that Selim commissioned became the dominant notation for Turkish and Armenian music. His name is associated with a school in Turkish classical music due to the revival and rebirth of music at his court. Selim III was also interested in Western music and, in 1797, invited an opera troupe for the first opera performance in the Ottoman Empire.

Writing under the &quot;nom de plume&quot; İlhami, Selim&#x27;s poetry is collected in a divan. Among regular attendees of his court was Şeyh Galib, considered one of the four greatest Ottoman poets. Galib is now believed to have been not only an intimate friend of the Sultan, as they were both relatively close in age, but through Galib&#x27;s poetry, there is overwhelming support for his new military reforms.

Selim III was a member of the Mevlevi Order of Sufi dervishes and entered into the order at the Galata Mevlevihanesi under the name Selim Dede. He was a renowned composer, creating many musical compositions, including a Mevlevi &quot;ayin&quot;, a long and complex liturgical form performed during the &quot;semâ&quot; (religious ceremonies) of the Mevlevi Order, in the &quot;makam&quot; &quot;Suzidilara.&quot;

He extended his patronage to Antoine Ignace Melling, appointed court architect in 1795. Melling constructed several palaces and other buildings for the Sultan and created engravings of contemporary Constantinople.

== Family ==
Selim III had numerous consorts, but no children.

=== Consorts ===
Selim III had at least thirteen consorts: 
* Nefizar Kadın. Baş Kadin (first consort). Also called Nafizar, Safizar or Sefizar. She died on 30 May 1792 and was buried in the Laleli Mosque. 
* Afitab Kadın. She became Baş Kadin after Nefizar&#x27;s death. She died in 1807. 
* Zibifer Kadın. Also called Ziybülfer. After Selim&#x27;s assassination, she lived in a palace on the Bosphorus. She died on 10 March 1817 and was buried in the Büyük Selimiye in Üsküdar. 
* Tabisefa Kadın. After the assassination of Selim III, she lived in the Fındıklı Palace. She died on 14 March 1855 and was buried in the Laleli mosque. 
* Refet Kadın. She was born in 1777. She was one of two concubines who tried to prevent Selim&#x27;s murder. Refet threw herself on the sultan to protect him but was thrown away and had to watch the killers finish the job while she screamed, cried, and tore her hair. She died on 22 October 1867 and was buried in the Mihrişah Sultan mausoleum in Eyüp. 
* Nüruşems Kadın. She died in May 1826 and was buried in the Laleli mosque. 
* Hüsnümah Kadın. She received the income of Tire. She died in 1814 and was buried in the Laleli mosque. 
* Demhoş Kadın. She became one of the consorts in 1799. She probably died around 1806. 
* Goncenigar Kadın. She died after 1806. 
* Mahbube Kadın. She died after 1806. 
* Aynısefa Kadın. She died after 1794. 
* Pakize Hanım. BaşIkbal, she was one of the major favorites. She was one of the two consorts who tried to prevent Selim&#x27;s murder. Pakize threw herself between the assassins and the sultan and was wounded in the hand in the struggle. 
* Meryem Hanim. She died on 22 August 1807.

<text>Mahmud II (, ; 20 July 1785 – 1 July 1839) was the sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1808 until his death in 1839. Often described as the &quot;Peter the Great of Turkey&quot;, Mahmud instituted extensive administrative, military, and fiscal reforms. His disbandment of the conservative Janissary corps removed a major obstacle to his and his successors&#x27; reforms in the Empire. Mahmud&#x27;s reign was also marked by further Ottoman military defeat and loss of territory as a result of nationalist uprisings and European intervention.

Mahmud ascended the throne following an 1808 coup which deposed his half-brother Mustafa IV. Early in his reign, the Ottoman Empire ceded Bessarabia to Russia at the end of the 1806–1812 Russo-Turkish War. Greece waged a successful war of independence that started in 1821 with British, French and Russian support, and Mahmud was forced to recognize the independent Greek state in 1832. The Ottomans lost more territory to Russia after the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829, and Ottoman Algeria was conquered by France beginning in 1830. Despite these setbacks, with a new modern army, Sultan Mahmud initiated a campaign of recentralization in the empire which saw the submission of derebeys and Ayans to central authority.

The Empire&#x27;s continued decline convinced Mahmud to resume the reforms that were halted before he came to power. In 1826, he orchestrated the Auspicious Incident, in which the Kapıkulu were forcibly abolished and many of its members executed, paving the way for the establishment of a modern Ottoman army and further military reforms. Mahmud also made sweeping changes to the bureaucracy in order to reestablish royal authority and increase administrative efficiency, and oversaw a reorganisation of the Ottoman foreign office. In 1838, Mahmud established the Supreme Council of Judicial Ordinances, and the next year, he introduced a Council of Ministers. He died of tuberculosis later that year and was succeeded by his son Abdulmejid I, who would continue to implement his modernization efforts.

==Early life==
Mahmud II was born on 20 July 1785, in the month of Ramazan. He was the son of Abdul Hamid I and his Seventh consort Nakşidil Kadin. He was the youngest son of his father, and the second child of his mother, he had an elder brother, Şehzade Seyfullah Murad, two years older than him, and a younger sister, Saliha Sultan, one year younger than him, both dead in infancy. According to tradition, he was confined in the Kafes after the death of his father.

==Accession==
In 1808, Mahmud II&#x27;s predecessor, and half-brother, Mustafa IV ordered his execution along with his cousin, the deposed Sultan Selim III, in order to defuse the rebellion. Selim III was killed, but Mahmud was safely kept hidden by his mother and was placed on the throne after the rebels deposed Mustafa IV. The leader of this rebellion, Alemdar Mustafa Pasha, later became Mahmud II&#x27;s vizier.

There are many stories surrounding the circumstances of his attempted murder. A version by the 19th-century Ottoman historian Ahmed Cevdet Pasha gives the following account: one of his slaves, a Georgian girl named Cevri, gathered ashes when she heard the commotion in the palace surrounding the murder of Selim III. When the assassins approached the harem chambers where Mahmud was staying, she was able to keep them away for a while by throwing ashes into their faces, temporarily blinding them. This allowed Mahmud to escape through a window and climb onto the roof of the harem. He apparently ran to the roof of the Third Court where other pages saw him and helped him come down with pieces of clothes that were quickly tied together as a ladder. By this time one of the leaders of the rebellion, Alemdar Mustafa Pasha arrived with his armed men, and upon seeing the dead body of Selim III proclaimed Mahmud as &quot;padishah&quot;. The slave girl Cevri Kalfa was awarded for her bravery and loyalty and appointed &quot;haznedar usta&quot;, the chief treasurer of the Imperial Harem, which was the second most important position in the hierarchy. A plain stone staircase at the &quot;Altınyol&quot; (Golden Way) of the Harem is called Staircase of Cevri (Jevri) Kalfa, since the events apparently happened around there and are associated with her.

Some of the Janissaries which brought Mahmud to power considered other candidates to put to the throne. Other candidates included Esma Sultan, the head of the Mevlevi order in Konya, or a prince from the Giray dynasty of the former Crimean Khanate.

==Reign overview==
The vizier took the initiative in resuming reforms that had been terminated by the conservative coup of 1807 that had brought Mustafa IV to power. However, he was killed during a rebellion in 1808 and Mahmud II temporarily abandoned the reforms. Mahmud II&#x27;s later reformation efforts would be much more successful.

===Russo-Turkish War of 1806–12===

After Mahmud II became sultan, Turkish border wars with the Russians continued. In 1810, the Russians surrounded the Silistre fortress for the second time. When Emperor Napoleon I of France declared war on Russia in 1811, Russian pressure on the Ottoman border diminished, a relief to Mahmud. By this time, Napoleon was about to embark on his invasion of Russia. He also invited the Ottomans to join his march on Russia. However, Napoleon, who had invaded all of Europe except the United Kingdom and the Ottoman Empire, could not be trusted and accepted as an ally; Mahmud rejected the offer. The Bucharest Agreement was reached with the Russians on 28 May 1812. According to the Treaty of Bucharest (1812), the Ottoman Empire ceded the eastern half of Moldavia to Russia (which renamed the territory as Bessarabia), although it had committed to protecting that region. Russia became a new power in the lower Danube area, and had an economically, diplomatically, and militarily profitable frontier. In Transcaucasia, the Ottoman Empire regained nearly all it had lost in the east: Poti, Anapa and Akhalkalaki. Russia retained Sukhum-Kale on the Abkhazian coast. In return, the Sultan accepted the Russian annexation of the Kingdom of Imereti, in 1810. The treaty was approved by Emperor Alexander I of Russia on 11 June, some 13 days before Napoleon&#x27;s invasion began. The Russian commanders were able to get many of their soldiers in the Balkans back to the western areas of the empire before the expected attack of Napoleon.

===War against the Saudi state===


During the early years of Mahmud II&#x27;s reign, his governor of Egypt Muhammad Ali Pasha successfully waged the Ottoman-Saudi War and reconquered the holy cities of Medina (1812) and Mecca (1813) from the First Saudi State.

Abdullah bin Saud and the First Saudi State had barred Muslims from the Ottoman Empire from entering the holy shrines of Mecca and Medina; his followers also desecrated the tombs of Ali ibn Abi Talib, Hassan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali. Abdullah bin Saud and his two followers were publicly beheaded for their crimes against holy cities and mosques.

===Greek War of Independence===


His reign also marked the first breakaway from the Ottoman Empire, with Greece declaring independence following a rebellion that started in 1821. In the wake of continued unrest he had ecumenical patriarch Gregory V executed on Easter Sunday 1821 for his inability to stem the uprising. During the Battle of Erzurum (1821), part of the Ottoman–Persian War (1821–1823), Mahmud II&#x27;s superior force was routed by Abbas Mirza, resulting in a Qajar Persian victory which got confirmed in the Treaties of Erzurum. Several years later, in 1827, the combined British, French and Russian navies defeated the Ottoman Navy at the Battle of Navarino; in the aftermath, the Ottoman Empire was forced to recognize Greece with the Treaty of Constantinople in July 1832. This event, together with the French conquest of Algeria, an Ottoman province (see Ottoman Algeria) in 1830, marked the beginning of the gradual break-up of the Ottoman Empire. Non-Turkish ethnic groups living in the empire&#x27;s territories, especially in Europe, started their own independence movements.

===The Auspicious Incident===

One of Mahmud II&#x27;s most notable acts during his reign was the destruction of the Janissary corps in June 1826. He accomplished this with careful calculation using his recently reformed wing of the military intended to replace the Janissaries. When the Janissaries mounted a demonstration against Mahmud II&#x27;s proposed military reforms, he had their barracks fired upon effectively crushing the formerly elite Ottoman troops and burned the Belgrade forest outside Istanbul to incinerate any remnants. This permitted the establishment of a European-style conscript army, recruited mainly from Turkish speakers of Rumelia and Asia Minor. Mahmud was also responsible for the subjugation of the Iraqi Mamluks by Ali Ridha Pasha in 1831. He ordered the execution of the renowned Ali Pasha of Tepelena. He sent his Grand Vizier to execute the Bosniak military commander Husein Gradaščević and dissolve the Bosnia Eyalet.

===Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29===
Another Russo-Turkish War (1828-29) broke out during Mahmud II&#x27;s reign and was fought without janissaries. Marshal von Diebitsch was armed (in the words of Baron Moltke) &quot;with the reputation of invincible success&quot;. He was to earn the name Sabalskanski (the crosser of the Balkans). Bypassing the Shumla fortress, he forcibly marched his troops over the Balkans, appearing before Adrianople. Sultan Mahmud II maintained control of his forces, unfurled the banner of the prophet and declared his intention of taking command of the army personally. Preparing to do so, he appeared, ill-advisedly, not on horseback but in a carriage. In the Divan, British and French ambassadors urged him to sue for peace.
===Government reforms===
In 1839, just prior to his death, he began preparations for the Tanzimat reform era which included introducing a Council of Ministers [&quot;Meclis-i Vükela&quot;], and the Supreme Council of Judicial Ordinances [&quot;Meclis-i Vâlâ-yı Ahkâm-ı Adliye&quot;]. The Tanzimat marked the beginning of modernization in the Ottoman Empire and had immediate effects on social and legal aspects of life in the Empire, such as European style clothing, architecture, legislation, institutional organization, and land reform.

He was also concerned for aspects of tradition. He made great efforts to revive the sport of archery. He ordered archery master Mustafa Kani to write a book about the history, construction, and use of Turkish bows, from which comes most of what is now known of Turkish archery.

Mahmud II died of tuberculosis, in 1839. His funeral was attended by crowds of people who came to bid the Sultan farewell. His son Abdulmejid I succeeded him and announce an intention of general reorganization (Tanzimat) with the Edict of Gülhane.

==Reforms==
===Legal reforms===
Among his reforms are the edicts (or firmans), by which he closed the Court of Confiscations, and took away much of the power of the Pashas.

Previous to the first of the firmans, the property of all persons banished or condemned to death was forfeited to the crown; and a sordid motive for acts of cruelty was thus kept in perpetual operation, besides the encouragement of a host of vile delators.

The second firman removed the ancient rights of Turkish governors to doom men to instant death by their will; the &quot;Paşas&quot;, the &quot;Ağas&quot;, and other officers, were enjoined that &quot;they should not presume to inflict, themselves, the punishment of death on any man, whether Raya or Turk, unless authorized by a legal sentence pronounced by the Kadı, and regularly signed by the judge.&quot; Mahmud also created an appeal system whereby a criminal could lodge an appeal to one of the Kazasker (chief military judge) of Asia or Europe, and finally to the Sultan himself, if the criminal chose to pursue the appeal even further.

About the same time that Mahmud II ordained these changes, he personally set an example of reform by regularly attending the Divan, or state council, instead of abstaining from attendance. The practice of the Sultan avoiding the Divan had been introduced as long ago as the reign of Suleiman I, and was considered one of the causes of the decline of the Empire by a Turkish historian nearly two centuries before Mahmud II&#x27;s time.

Mahmud II also addressed some of the worst abuses connected with the vakıfs, by placing their revenues under state administration (see Ministry of Evkaf). However, he did not venture to apply this vast mass of property to the general purposes of the government. His modernizations included the relaxation of much of the restrictions on alcoholic beverages in the Empire, and the sultan himself was known to drink socially with his ministers. By the end of his reign, his reforms had mostly normalized drinking among the upper classes and political figures in the Empire.

The financial situation of the Empire was troubling during his reign, and certain social classes had long been under the oppression of heavy taxes. In dealing with the complicated questions that therefore arose, Mahmud II is considered to have demonstrated the best spirit of the best of the Köprülüs. A firma dated 22 February 1834, abolished the vexatious charges which public functionaries, when traversing the provinces, had long been accustomed to take from the inhabitants. By the same edict, all collection of money, except for the two regular half-yearly periods, was denounced as abuses. &quot;No one is ignorant,&quot; said Sultan Mahmud II in this document, &quot;that I am bound to afford support to all my subjects against vexatious proceedings; to endeavour unceasingly to lighten, instead of increasing their burdens, and to ensure peace and tranquility. Therefore, those acts of oppression are at once contrary to the will of God, and to my imperial orders.&quot;

The &quot;haraç&quot;, or capitation-tax, though moderate and exempting those who paid it from military service, had long been made an engine of gross tyranny through the insolence and misconduct of the government collectors. The firman of 1834 abolished the old mode of levying it and ordained that it should be raised by a commission composed of the &quot;Kadı&quot;, the Muslim governors, and the &quot;Ayans&quot;, or municipal chiefs of &quot;Rayas&quot; in each district. Many other financial improvements were affected. By another important series of measures, the administrative government was simplified and strengthened, and a large number of sinecure offices were abolished. Sultan Mahmud II provided a valuable personal example of good sense, and economy, organising the imperial household, suppressing all titles without duties, and all salaried officials without functions.

===Military reforms===

Mahmud II dealt effectively with the military fiefs, the &quot;Tımar&quot;s, and the &quot;Ziamet&quot;s. These had been instituted to furnish the old effective military force, but had long ceased to serve this purpose. By attaching them to the public domains, Mahmud II materially strengthened the resources of the state, and put an end to a host of corruptions. One of the most resolute acts of his ruling was the suppression of the &quot;Dere Beys&quot;, the hereditary local chiefs (with power to nominate their successors in default of male heirs), which, in one of the worst abuses of the Ottoman feudal system, had made themselves petty princes in almost every province of the empire.

The reduction of these insubordinate feudatories was not affected at once, or without severe struggles and frequent rebellions. Mahmud II steadily persevered in this great measure and ultimately the island of Cyprus became the only part of the empire in which power that was not emanating from the Sultan was allowed to be retained by &quot;Dere Beys&quot;.

One of his most notable achievement was the abolition (through use of military force, execution and exile, and banning of the Bektashi order) of the Janissary corps, event known as The Auspicious Incident, in 1826 and the establishment of a modern Ottoman army, named the Asakir-i Mansure-i Muhammediye (meaning &#x27;Victorious Soldiers of Muhammad&#x27; in Ottoman Turkish).

Following the loss of Greece after the Battle of Navarino against the combined British-French-Russian flotilla in 1827, Mahmud II gave top priority to rebuilding a strong Ottoman naval force. The first steamships of the Ottoman Navy were acquired in 1828. In 1829 the world&#x27;s largest warship for many years, the 201 x 56 kadem (1 kadem = 37.887 cm) or ship of the line &quot;Mahmudiye&quot;, which had 128 cannons on 3 decks and carried 1,280 sailors on board, was built for the Ottoman Navy at the Imperial Naval Arsenal (Tersâne-i Âmire) on the Golden Horn in Constantinople (kadem, which translates as &quot;foot&quot;, is often misinterpreted as equivalent in length to one imperial foot, hence the wrongly converted dimensions of &quot;201 x 56 ft, or 62 x 17 m&quot; in some sources.)

===Other reforms===
During his reign, Mahmud II also made sweeping reforms of the bureaucracy in order to reestablish royal authority and increase the administrative efficiency of his government. This was accomplished by abolishing old offices, introducing new lines of responsibility, and raised salaries in an attempt to end bribery. In 1838 he founded two institutions aimed towards training government officials. In 1831, Mahmud II also established an official gazette, &quot;Takvim-i Vekayi&quot; (Calendar of Events). This was the first newspaper to be published in the Ottoman-Turkish language and was required reading for all civil servants.

Clothing was also an essential aspect of Mahmud II&#x27;s reforms. He began by officially adopting the fez for the military after the Janissary eradication in 1826, which signified a break from the old style of military dress. On top of this, he ordered civilian officials to also adopt a similar, but plain, fez to distinguish them from the military. He planned for the population to adopt this as well, as he desired a homogeneous look for Ottoman society with an 1829 regulatory law. Unlike past Sultanic clothing decrees and those of other societies, Mahmud II wanted all levels of government and civilians to look the same. He faced significant resistance to these measures specifically from religious groups, laborers, and military members because of traditional, religious, and practical reasons. Mahmud II&#x27;s portraits also give a valuable insight into his clothing mentality, as he switched to a more European style and fez after 1826.

On top of these reforms, Mahmud II was also critical in the establishment and flourishing of an Ottoman foreign affairs office. While he built upon Selim III&#x27;s foundational elements of international diplomacy, Mahmud II was the first to create the title of Foreign Minister and Undersecretary in 1836. He placed enormous importance on this position and equated salary and rank with the highest military and civilian positions. Mahmud II also expanded the Language Office and Translation Office, and by 1833 it began to grow in both size and importance. After the reorganization of these offices, he also resumed Selim&#x27;s efforts to create a system of permanent diplomatic representation in Europe. In 1834, permanent European embassies were established with the first being in Paris. Despite the difficulties that came along with these actions, the expansion of diplomacy increased the transmission of ideas that would have a revolutionary effect on the development of bureaucracy and Ottoman society as a whole.

==Family==
===Consorts===
Mahmud II had at least nineteen consorts:
* Fatma Kadın (? – February 1809). BaşKadin (First Consort) for one year before her death.

* Hacıye Pertevpiyale Nevfidan Kadın (4 January 1793 – 27 December 1855). Mahmud&#x27;s concubine already when he was a prince (conceived their first daughter, Fatma Sultan, born six months after her father&#x27;s accession to the throne, in this period, thus violating the rules of the harem that forbade the princes to have children until the eventual ascent al tronk), became BaşKadin after Alicenab&#x27;s death. She was the mother of at least one son and four daughters, and she also raised Adile Sultan when she was orphaned on 1830. Abdülmecid I of her allowed her to go on pilgrimage to Mecca, which earned her the name &quot;Haciye&quot;.
* Dilseza Kadın (? – 1816). Second Kadın. Mother of at least two sons. Buried in the mausoleum of the Dolmabahçe Palace.

* Zernigar Kadın (? – 1830). Of Armenian descent, her real name was Maryam. Educated by Esma Sultan, Mahmud II&#x27;s half-sister. Mother of a daughter. Fourth Ikbal in 1826, then Seventh Kadın and finally Third Kadın.
* Nurtab Kadın (1810 – 2 January 1886). Fourth Kadın. She was the adoptive mother of Şevkefza Sultan, mother of Murad V. Buried in the Mahmud II mausoleum.
* Hacıye Hoşyar Kadın (? – 1859, Mecca). Mother of two daughters. Third Kadın and then Second. Tall and blonde, she had been educated by Beyhan Sultan, daughter of Mustafa III.

He saw her play at a banquet hosted by her sister and asked for it for himself. She was of great musical talent, and she composed a song for the sultan, entitled &quot;Hüsnümelek bir peridir/Cümlesinin dilberidir.&quot; She did not live in the harem but in a separate wing of the palace. After Mahmud&#x27;s death she became a dance teacher in the harem of his heir and son Abdülmecid I. Buried in the Mahmud II mausoleum.
* Tiryal Hanim (1810–1883). Third Ikbal. Perhaps the mother of a child, she loved Abdülaziz I as if he were her own son, and he too considered her a second mother, so much so that during his reign, he guaranteed her the same treatment as his own mother, making her live in the Beylerbeyi Palace and granting her wealth and prestige, and everyone considered Tiryal the second Valide Sultan. Tiriyal donated her villa in Çamlıca to Şehzade Yusuf Izzedin, Abdülaziz&#x27;s eldest son, whom she considered her grandson. He built a glass pavilion and fountain in Çamlıca and a second fountain in Üsküdar. She took care of the education of Dilpesend Kadın, who became the consort of Abdülhamid II, grandson of Mahmud II through his son Abdülmecid I. She was buried in the Yeni Cami, in front of the fountain built in her name.

===Daughters===
Mahmud II had at least nineteen daughters, but only six survived infancy and only four reached the age of marriage:
* Fatma Sultan (4 February 1809 – 5 August 1809) – with Nevfidan Kadin. Her birth, the first in the imperial dynasty after 19 years and just six months after her father&#x27;s accession to the throne, caused scandal, as it meant she must have been conceived when Mahmud was still Şehzade and confined to Kafes, which was forbidden at the time.

==In fiction==
The 2006 historical detective novel &quot;The Janissary Tree&quot;, by Jason Goodwin, is set in 1836 Constantinople, with Mahmud II&#x27;s modernising reforms (and conservative opposition to them) forming the background of the plot. The Sultan himself and his mother appear in several scenes.

The 1989 film &quot;Intimate Power&quot;, also known as &quot;The Favorite&quot;, is adapted from a historical fiction novel by Prince Michael of Greece. It portrays a legend about Aimée du Buc de Rivéry as a young captured French girl who, after spending years in an Ottoman harem, outlives two Sultans and protects Mahmud as his surrogate mother. Mahmud is a minor role in the film but is portrayed as both an adult and a child. The film concludes with a variation of his dramatic succession.

<text>Mustafa IV (; ; 8 September 1779 – 16 November 1808) was the sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1807 to 1808.

==Early life==
Mustafa IV was born on 8 September 1779 in Constantinople. He was the son of Sultan Abdul Hamid I (1774–1789) and Sineperver Sultan.

Both he and his half-brother, Mahmud II, were the last remaining male members of the House of Osman after their cousin, the reformist Sultan Selim III (1789–1807). They alone were therefore eligible to inherit the throne from Selim, by whom they were treated favorably. Since Mustafa was the elder, he took precedence over his brother to the throne. During his short reign, Mustafa would save his cousin&#x27;s life and order him murdered. Mustafa was Sultan Selim III&#x27;s favourite crown prince, but he deceived his cousin and cooperated with the rebels to take his throne.

==Reign==
Mustafa ascended to the throne after the deposition of his cousin, Selim, on 29 May 1807. He came to the throne in the wake of the turbulent events that led to the &quot;fatwa&quot; against Selim for &quot;introduc[ing] among the Muslims the manners of infidels and showing an intention to suppress the Janissaries&quot;. Selim fled to the palace, where he swore fealty to his cousin as the new sultan, and attempted to commit suicide. Mustafa spared his life by smashing the cup of poison that his cousin tried to drink.

Mustafa&#x27;s brief reign was turbulent. Immediately upon ascending to the throne, the Janissaries rioted throughout Constantinople, looting and murdering anyone who appeared to support Selim. More threatening, however, was a truce signed with the Russians, which freed Mustafa Pasha, a pro-reformist commander stationed on the Danube, to march his army back to Constantinople to restore Selim. With the aid of the Grand Vizier of Adrianople, the army marched on the capital and seized the palace.
Sarıbeyzade Aleko, the interpreter of Fenerli Divan-ı Hümayun, was executed on 11 September 1807 because he was involved in spying on government affairs unrelated to his job. It was written on the label hanging around his neck that he gave state secrets to the enemy. This execution strained relations with France. French envoy Sebastiani protested the execution of Aleko, who was under the government&#x27;s patronage, by going to Babıali. After the cease-fire agreement signed in the Russian lada and the turmoil in the Silistra army, the Ottoman troops returned to Edirne, who had no army character left.

Meanwhile, in Istanbul and Edirne, after a long winter with severe frosts, shortages and wood shortages were experienced. Troops starved, and the cadre of Edirne was devastated. Soldiers were asked to dispatch soldiers from the provincial governors until only a few had come from places near Istanbul, such as Izmit and Şile. The pro-New Order protestors in Anatolia and Çapanoğlu Süleyman Bey, in the first place, had cut all kinds of aid towards Istanbul.

Attempting to secure his position by positing himself as Osman&#x27;s only surviving heir, Mustafa ordered Selim and his brother Mahmud murdered at Topkapı Palace in Constantinople. He then ordered his guards to show the rebels Selim&#x27;s body, and they promptly tossed it into the palace&#x27;s inner courtyard. Mustafa then ascended his throne, assuming that Mahmud was also dead, but the prince had been hiding in a bath furnace. Just as the rebels demanded that Mustafa &quot;yield his place to a worthier&quot;, Mahmud revealed himself, and Mustafa was deposed. The failure of his short reign prevented the efforts to undo the reforms, which continued under Mahmud.

==Death==

Mustafa was later killed on Mahmud&#x27;s orders on 16 November 1808 and was buried in his father&#x27;s mausoleum.

==Family==
Due to his short reign, Mustafa IV did not have a large family. He had four known consorts, a son and a daughter, who died newborn.

===Consorts===
Mustafa IV had four known consorts:
*Şevkinür Kadın. BaşKadin (first consort). She died in 1812 and was buried in Abdülhamid I&#x27;s mausoleum.
*Peykidil Kadın. She was executed in August 1808 by Mahmud II, accused of plotting against him with Mustafa IV and Alemdar Mustafa Pasha. According to sources, she was tied to a weight and thrown into the sea from the Maiden&#x27;s Tower. Along with her, several concubines accused of being her accomplices were also executed. 
*Dilpezir Kadın. She died in 1809 and was buried in Abdülhamid I&#x27;s mausoleum.
*Seyare Kadın. She died in 1817 and was buried in Abdülhamid I&#x27;s mausoleum.

===Sons===
Mustafa IV had only one son:
*Şehzade Ahmed (1809–1809). Born posthumously. 
In the decades following Mustafa&#x27;s death, a certain Ahmed Nedir, a Georgian man, claimed to be Mustafa IV&#x27;s secret son, born after his mother, a Russian woman, was forced to flee Constantinople while she was pregnant following Mustafa IV&#x27;s death. According to another version, Ahmed Nedir was the Şehzade Ahmed himself, whose death was faked in order to hide the child abroad, for fear that Mahmud II execute him. His claims were never proven or taken into consideration.

===Daughters===
Mustafa IV had only one daughter:
* Emine Sultan (6 May 1809 – October 1809). Born posthumously, she is buried with her father in the Hamidiye mausoleum. Her wet nurse was Muhtaviye Hatun, wife of Said Bey (died 16 November 1812, buried in Karacaahmet Cemetery).

<text>In fashion design, &quot;boyfriend&quot; is a style of women&#x27;s clothing that draws heavily from corresponding men&#x27;s garments. Boyfriend-style clothes are designed to be looser or boxier and tend to be oversized – giving the appearance that one is wearing a &quot;boyfriend&#x27;s clothing&quot;. The style can be traced back to the 1960s, when Marilyn Monroe wore her boyfriend&#x27;s loosely-fitting jeans, which contrasted her feminine looks with a masculine aesthetic. Modern boyfriend-style clothes are often designed to look unisex and fit most women. As the trend continues to grow, many brands such as Gap, Forever 21, H&amp;M, and Urban Outfitters, have created boyfriend or men&#x27;s-inspired fashion targeted at female consumers.

==Background of women in menswear==
In the 19th century, women&#x27;s fashion within Western society typically consisted of dresses, skirts, and corsets. Amelia Bloomer, a women&#x27;s rights activist in the 1850s, was one of the first to change mainstream womenswear when she introduced the bloomer. In the 1930s, movie stars such as Katharine Hepburn and Marlene Dietrich sometimes wore menswear-style fashion. During World War II, masculine attire became more acceptable as womenswear, during which time many women were drafted into jobs requiring physical labour. After the end of the war, many women returned to more feminine forms of dressing. It was not until the 1960s and early 1970s that menswear-inspired fashion was no longer considered a rebellious political statement.

<doc id="208643" wikidata="Q311224" url="?curid=208643" title="Fulmar">
<text>The fulmars are tubenosed seabirds of the family Procellariidae. The family includes two extant species and two extinct fossil species from the Miocene.

Fulmars superficially resemble gulls, but are readily distinguished by their flight on stiff wings, and their tube noses. They breed on cliffs, laying one or rarely two eggs on a ledge of bare rock or on a grassy cliff. Outside the breeding season, they are pelagic, feeding on fish, squid and shrimp in the open ocean. They are long-lived for birds, living for up to 40 years.

Historically, temperate Atlantic populations of the northern fulmar lived on the islands of St. Kilda, where it was extensively hunted, and Grimsey (Iceland). The species has expanded its breeding range eastwards and southwards to the coasts of the Faroes, Britain and Ireland, northern France, Norway and Heligoland, as well as around the coast of Iceland and to southern Greenland. Arctic populations are found in Baffin Island, Jan Mayen and Svalbard.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus &quot;Fulmarus&quot; was introduced in 1826 by the English naturalist James Stephens. The name comes from the Old Norse &quot;Fúlmár&quot; meaning &quot;foul-mew&quot; or &quot;foul-gull&quot; because of the birds&#x27; habit of ejecting a foul-smelling oil. The type species was designated by George Gray in 1855 as the northern fulmar .

As members of Procellaridae and then the order Procellariiformes, they share certain traits. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called naricorns. The bills of Procellariiformes are unique in being split into between seven and nine horny plates. Finally, they produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. This can be sprayed out of their mouths as a defence against predators and as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. It will mat the plumage of avian predators, which can lead to their death. Fulmars have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a strong saline solution from their nose.

===Extant species===
The genus contains the following two species.



===Fossils===
Two prehistoric species have been described from fossil bones found on the Pacific coast of California: &quot;Fulmarus miocaenus&quot; (Temblor Formation) and &quot;Fulmarus hammeri&quot; from the Miocene.

==Description==
The two fulmars are closely related seabirds occupying the same niche in different oceans. The northern fulmar (&quot;Fulmarus glacialis&quot;) or just fulmar lives in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, whereas the southern fulmar, (&quot;Fulmarus glacialoides&quot;) is, as its name implies, a bird of the Southern Ocean. These birds look superficially like gulls, but are not closely related, and are in fact petrels. The northern species is grey and white with a yellow bill, in length with a wingspan. The southern form is a paler bird with dark wing tips, long, with a wingspan.

==Behavior==

===Breeding===

Both recent species breed on cliffs, laying a single white egg. Unlike many small to medium birds in the Procellariiformes, they are neither nocturnal breeders, nor do they use burrows; their eggs are laid on the bare rock or in shallow depressions lined with plant material.

In Britain, northern fulmars historically bred on St. Kilda (where their harvesting for oil, feathers and meat was central to the islands&#x27; economy). They spread into northern Scotland in the 19th century, and to the rest of the United Kingdom by 1930. The expansion has continued further south; the fulmar can now often be seen in the English Channel and in France along the northern and western coasts, with breeding pairs or small colonies in Nord, Picardy, Normandy and along the Atlantic coast in Brittany.

===Feeding===

Fulmars are highly pelagic outside the breeding season, like most tubenoses, feeding on fish, small squid, shrimp, crustaceans, marine worms, and carrion. The range of these species increased greatly in the 20th century due to the availability of fish offal from commercial fleets, but may contract because of less food from this source and climatic change. The population increase has been especially notable in the British Isles.

Like other petrels, their walking ability is limited, but they are strong fliers, with a stiff wing action quite unlike the gulls. They look bull-necked compared to gulls, and have short stubby bills. They are long-lived, the longest recorded lifespan for &quot;F. glacialis&quot; being 40 years, 10 months and 16 days.

==Relationship with humans==
Fulmars have for centuries been hunted for food. The engraver Thomas Bewick wrote in 1804 that &quot;Pennant, speaking of those [birds] which breed on, or inhabit, the Isle of St Kilda, says—&#x27;No bird is of so much use to the islanders as this: the Fulmar supplies them with oil for their lamps, down for their beds, a delicacy for their tables, a balm for their wounds, and a medicine for their distempers. A photograph by George Washington Wilson taken about 1886 shows a &quot;view of the men and women of St Kilda on the beach dividing up the catch of Fulmar&quot;. James Fisher, author of &quot;The Fulmar&quot; (1952) calculated that every person on St Kilda consumed over 100 fulmars each year; the meat was their staple food, and they caught around 12,000 birds annually. Fulmar eggs were collected until the late 1920s in the St Kilda islands by their men scaling the cliffs. The eggs were buried in St Kilda peat ash to be eaten through the cold, northern winters. The eggs were considered to taste like duck eggs in taste and nourishment. However, when the human population left St Kilda in 1930, the fulmar population did not suddenly increase. 

Both the southern fulmar and the northern fulmar are listed as of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). &#x27;

<text>Promulgation is the formal proclamation or the declaration that a new statutory or administrative law is enacted after its final approval. In some jurisdictions, this additional step is necessary before the law can take effect.

After a new law is approved, it is announced to the public through the publication of government gazettes and/or on official government bulletins. National laws of extraordinary importance to the public may be announced by the head of state or head of government on a national broadcast. Local laws are usually announced in local newspapers and published in bulletins or compendia of municipal regulations.

==Jurisdiction-specific details==
===Armenia===

Bills are enacted by the President of Armenia and published in the &quot;Official Gazette of Armenia&quot;.

===Belgium===

Statutes are promulgated by the King of the Belgians and published in the &quot;Belgian Official Journal&quot;. Decrees and Ordinances are promulgated by the different Regional and Community governments and published in the Belgian Official Journal.

===Canada===

Canadian federal Acts of Parliament, orders in council, proclamations, public notices, official appointments and proposed regulations from the Government of Canada are promulgated in the &quot;Canada Gazette&quot; (French: &quot;Gazette du Canada&quot;). The &quot;Canada Gazette&quot; consists of three parts that are published separately. Part 1 promulgates public notices, official appointments and proposed regulations; Part 2 promulgates regulations; and Part 3 promulgates Acts of Parliament. Each province and territory has its own publication in which their laws, regulations, and other statutory instruments are promulgated. 
===Canon law (Catholic Church)===

A canonical law issued by the Pope (or with his consent in the case of laws issued by an ecumenical council or congregation) is promulgated when it is published in &quot;Acta Apostolicae Sedis&quot;, and by default has the force of law three months after promulgation. Laws issued by bishops and particular councils are promulgated in various ways but by default take effect one month after promulgation.

According to canon 7 of the 1983 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot;, (&quot;A law is instituted when it is promulgated&quot;). This is an ancient provision in Latin Church canon law, dating in its plural form to the Latin formulation of the great 12th century codifier of canon law, Gratian: (&quot;Laws are instituted when they are promulgated&quot;).

===France===

The President of France promulgates law (he may ask Parliament to reconsider the law, but only once).

===Germany===

The President of Germany has the duty to duly promulgate and issue laws, unless the President deems them &quot;evidently unconstitutional&quot;. The question to what degree they must be convinced of the constitutional violation to deny promulgation is hotly debated.

===Hong Kong===

Bills have to be signed and promulgated by the Chief Executive, and be announced by the government in the gazette.

===Hungary===

Legislative proposals adopted by the National Assembly obtain the force of law only after they are signed by the President of the Republic and published in the official gazette Magyar Közlöny.

===India===

If at any time the Indian Parliament is not in session, the President of India on the recommendation of the Union Cabinet may promulgate an ordinance, which will have the same effect as an Act of Parliament. However, such ordinance will be presented before the parliament for final approval. They can only be issued when Parliament is not in session. They enable the Indian government to take immediate legislative action. Ordinances cease to operate either if Parliament does not approve of them within six weeks of reassembly, or if disapproving resolutions are passed by both Houses. It is also compulsory for a session of Parliament to be held within six months.

===Ireland, Republic of===

All laws passed by the Oireachtas are promulgated by a notice in the &quot;Iris Oifigiúil&quot; published by the President of Ireland, as required by the Constitution of Ireland.

===Isle of Man===

By ancient custom an Act of Tynwald, the legislature of the island, did not come into force until it had been &quot;promulgated&quot; at an open-air sitting of Tynwald, usually held on Tynwald Hill at St John&#x27;s on St John&#x27;s Day (24 June) but since the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in 1753 on 5 July (or on the following Monday if 5 July is a Saturday or Sunday). Promulgation originally consisted of the reading of the Act in English and Manx, but after 1865 the reading of the title of the Act and a summary of each section were sufficient. This was reduced in 1895 to the titles and a memorandum of the object and purport of the Act, and since 1988 only the short title and a summary of the long title have been read. An emergency procedure enabling an Act to come into force on royal assent being announced at an ordinary sitting of Tynwald, subject to its being promulgated within 12 months, was introduced in 1916; since 1976 this has been the &#x27;default&#x27; procedure, and since 1988 an Act ceases to have effect unless promulgated within 18 months after royal assent is announced in Tynwald.

===Italy===

The President of the Republic promulgates law. The President remands a law to the Chambers of Parliament, with an explanation, and asks for reconsideration—but must promulgate the law if it is re-approved without modification.

===Japan===

The Emperor of Japan promulgates laws passed by the Diet. The Emperor cannot refuse to promulgate a law.

===Kenya===

Promulgation is performed by the President.

===Luxembourg===
Article 34 of the constitution of Luxembourg requires the grand duke or duchess to &quot;promulgate&quot; a new law for it to take effect.

===Macau===

Bills have to approved by the Legislative Assembly, signed and promulgated by the Chief Executive. They must be published in the Official Gazette &quot;Boletim Oficial&quot;.

===Malta===

When a bill is approved by the House of Representatives of Malta, it is presented to the President of Malta for his assent. According to constitutional obligation he shall without delay signify that he assents and hence promulgate the said bill into a parliamentary act. The parliamentary act is then published in the &quot;Malta Government Gazette&quot;, and thus comes into force.

===Mexico===

A law is approved by Congress, signed by the President, and published in the Official Diary of the Federation (), or DOF. Each law in its Transitional Articles (&quot;Transitorios&quot;) states when the Law takes effect (&quot;entra en vigor&quot;) and, when applicable, what law it cancels and replaces. Regulations are prepared by the Executive branch in order to establish the administration of the Law. They are signed by the President and published in the DOF.

===Poland===

Laws have to be promulgated by the President of the Republic in the &quot;Dziennik Ustaw&quot; journal. The President may refer to the Constitutional Tribunal; if he has not made reference, he may refer the bill to the Sejm (veto) for further reconsideration. The bill shall then be promulgated.

===Portugal===

The laws (statutes issued by the Parliament) and the decree-laws (statutes issued by the Government) have to be promulgated by the President of Portugal to take effect. The promulgation is the act by which the President solemnly testifies the existence of a rule of law and intimates its observation. The President may however decide not to promulgate the bill and to veto it with a political or legal justification. After the promulgation, the statutes are published in the &quot;Diário da República&quot; (official journal), with the laws needing a Government referendum before.

===Romania===

Bills have to be promulgated by the President and afterwards published in the official gazette, &quot;Monitorul Oficial&quot;.

===Spain===
Article 91 of the Spanish Constitution establishes that bills, upon being passed by the &quot;Cortes Generales&quot;, must be sanctioned (i.e., given royal assent) by the King of Spain within two weeks of their passing. The King will then promulgate and immediately publish them in the official gazette, the &quot;Boletín Oficial del Estado&quot;.

===Sweden===

Laws and secondary legislation are promulgated by the Government of Sweden and are published in the Swedish Code of Statutes ().

===Turkey===

Bills are promulgated by the President of the Republic and published in the official gazette, &quot;Resmi Gazete&quot;.

===United Kingdom===
Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom are promulgated when given royal assent by the King. The sovereign may appear personally in the House of Lords or may appoint Lords Commissioners, who announce that royal assent has been granted at a ceremony held at the Palace of Westminster for this purpose. However, royal assent is usually granted less ceremonially by letters patent.

=== United States ===
Acts of Congress are given the force of law, in one of the following ways: signed by the President of the United States; neither signed nor vetoed by the President within ten days from reception (excluding Sundays) while the Congress is in session; or, when both the Senate and the House of Representatives vote, by a two-thirds majority in each chamber, to override a presidential veto during its session. In United States administrative law, a federal regulation may be said to be formally promulgated when it appears in the &quot;Federal Register&quot; and after the public-comment period concludes.

Amendments to the United States Constitution attain force of law &quot;when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states, or by conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress&quot;. When the requisite number of state ratifications has been reached (currently 38), it is the duty of the Archivist of the United States to issue a certificate proclaiming a particular amendment duly ratified and part of the Constitution.

<doc id="208648" wikidata="Q1209589" url="?curid=208648" title="Virgin Islands March">
<text>The &quot;Virgin Islands March&quot; is the regional anthem of the United States Virgin Islands. The song was composed by Sam Williams and U.S. Virgin Island native Alton Adams in the 1920s. It served as an unofficial regional anthem of the U.S. Virgin Islands until 1963, when it was officially recognized by Legislative Act.

The song itself is a brisk martial march, consisting of an introductory instrumental section followed by a very cheerful melody. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reporter Alex Marshall compared it favorably to some national anthems, suggesting that it was reminiscent of the music of the Disney film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;.

Since the U.S. Virgin Islands is a U.S. insular territory, the national anthem is still the U.S. one, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;. During international sporting events, only the &quot;Virgin Islands March&quot; is played.

==Lyrics==
On most occasions, the first verse followed by the last verse is sung.

<doc id="208651" wikidata="Q1861110" url="?curid=208651" title="X-bar theory">
<text>In linguistics, X-bar theory is a model of phrase structure and a theory of syntactic category formation that proposes a universal schema for how phrases are organized. It suggests that all phrases share a common underlying structure, regardless of their specific category (noun phrase, verb phrase, etc.). This structure, known as the X-bar schema, is based on the idea that every phrase (XP, X phrase) has a head, which determines the type (syntactic category) of the phrase (X). 

The theory was first proposed by Noam Chomsky in 1970 reformulating the ideas of Zellig Harris (1951), and further developed by Ray Jackendoff (1974, 1977a, 1977b), along the lines of the theory of generative grammar put forth in the 1950s by Chomsky. It aimed to simplify and generalize the rules of grammar, addressing limitations of earlier phrase structure models. X-bar theory was an important step forward because it simplified the description of sentence structure. Earlier approaches needed many phrase structure rules, which went against the idea of a simple, underlying system for language. X-bar theory offered a more elegant and economical solution, aligned with the thesis of generative grammar.

X-bar theory was incorporated into both transformational and nontransformational theories of syntax, including government and binding theory (GB), generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG), lexical-functional grammar (LFG), and head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG). Although recent work in the minimalist program has largely abandoned X-bar schema in favor of bare phrase structure approaches, the theory&#x27;s central assumptions are still valid in different forms and terms in many theories of minimalist syntax.

== Background ==
The X-bar theory was developed to resolve the issues that phrase structure rules (PSR) under the Standard Theory had.

The PSR approach has the following four main issues.
# It assumes exocentric structures such as &quot;S → NP Aux VP&quot;. This is contrary to the fact that phrases have heads in all circumstances.
# While the sentence &quot;John talked to the man&quot;, for example, involves the PSR of a verb phrase &quot;VP → V (PP)&quot;, &quot;John talked to the man in person&quot; involves the PSR of &quot;VP → V (PP) (PP)&quot;. This indicates that it is necessary to posit new PSRs every time when an undefined structure is observed in E-language, which amounts to adding an indiscriminate number of grammatical rules to Universal Grammar. This poses serious issues from the perspectives of the Plato&#x27;s problem and the poverty of the stimulus.
# It wrongly rules in structures that are impossible in natural language such as &quot;VP → NP A PP&quot;, because as in 1 and 2, the PSR countenances phrases that do not have endocentric structures.
# It fails to capture sentence ambiguities because it assumes flat, nonhierarchical structures.
The X-bar theory is a theory that attempts to resolve these issues by assuming the mold or template phrasal structure of &quot;XP&quot;.

== X-bar schema ==
=== Basic principles ===
The &quot;X&quot; in the X-bar theory is equivalent to a variable in mathematics: It can be substituted by syntactic categories such as N, V, A, and P. These categories are lexemes and not phrases: The &quot;X-bar&quot; is a grammatical unit larger than X, thus than a lexeme, and the X-double-bar (=XP) outsizes the X(-single)-bar. X-double-bar categories are equal to phrasal categories such as NP, VP, AP, and PP.

The X-bar theory assumes that all phrasal categories have the structure in Figure 1. This structure is called the X-bar schema.

As in Figure 1, the phrasal category XP is notated by an X with a double overbar. For typewriting reasons, the bar symbol is often substituted by the prime (&#x27;), as in X&#x27;.

The X-bar theory embodies two central principles.
* Headedness principle: Every phrase has a head.
* Binarity principle: Every node branches into two different nodes.
The headedness principle resolves the issues 1 and 3 above simultaneously. The binarity principle is important to projection and ambiguity, which will be explained below.

The X-bar schema consists of a head and its circumstantial components, in accordance with the headedness principle. The relevant components are as follows:
* Specifier: [obligatory] The node that is in a sister relation with an X&#x27; node. This is a term that refers to the syntactic position itself.
* Head: [obligatory] The core of a phrase, into which a lexeme fits. The head determines the form and characteristics of the phrase as a whole.
* Complement: [obligatory] An argument required by the head.
* Adjunct: [optional] A modifier for the phrase constituted by the head.
The specifier, head, and complement are obligatory; hence, a phrasal category XP must contain one specifier, one head, and one complement. On the other hand, the adjunct is optional; hence, a phrasal category contains zero or more adjuncts. Accordingly, when a phrasal category XP does not have an adjunct, it forms the structure in Figure 2.

For example, the NP &quot;linguistics&quot; in the sentence &quot;John studies linguistics&quot; has the structure in Figure 3.

It is important that even if there are no candidates that can fit into the specifier and complement positions, these positions are syntactically present, and thus they are merely empty and unoccupied. (This is a natural consequence of the binarity principle.) This means that all phrasal categories have fundamentally uniform structures under the X-bar schema, which makes it unnecessary to assume that different phrases have different structures, unlike when one adopts the PSR. (This resolves the second issue above.) In the meantime, one needs to be wary of when such empty positions are representationally omitted as in Figure 4.

In illustrating syntactic structures this way, at least one X&#x27;-level node is present in any circumstance because the complement is obligatory.

Next, the X&quot; and X&#x27; inherit the characteristics of the head X. This trait inheritance is referred to as projection.

Figure 5 suggests that syntactic structures are derived in a bottom-up fashion under the X-bar theory. More specifically, the structures are derived via the following processes.
# A lexeme is fitted into the head. Heads are sometimes called zero-level projections because they are X-zero-bar-level categories, notated as X0.
# The head and the complement are combined to form an X-single-bar (X, X&#x27;) node, which constitutes a semi-phrasal category (a syntactic category not as big as a phrase). This category is called intermediate projection.
# (An adjunct, if there is any, combines with an X&#x27; to form another X&#x27;. If there is more than one adjunct, this process is repeated.)
# An intermediate projection combines with the specifier, forming a complete phrasal category XP (X-double-bar). This category is called maximal projection.

It is important that all the processes except for the third are obligatory. This means that one phrasal category necessarily includes X0, X, and XP (=X&quot;). Moreover, nodes bigger than X0 (thus, X and XP nodes) are called constituents.

=== Directionality of branching ===
Figures 1–5 are based on the word order of English, but the X-bar schema does not specify the directionality of branching because the binarity principle does not have a rule on it. For example, &quot;John read a long book of linguistics with a red cover&quot;, which involves two adjuncts, may have either of the structures in Figure 6 or Figure 7. (The figures follow the convention of omitting the inner structures of certain phrasal categories with triangles.)

The structure in Figure 6 yields the meaning &quot;the book of linguistics with a red cover is long&quot;, and the one in Figure 7 &quot;the long book of linguistics is with a red cover&quot; (see also #Hierarchical structure). What is important is the directionality of the nodes N&#x27;2 and N&#x27;3: One is left-branching, while the other is right-branching. Accordingly, the X-bar theory, more specifically the binarity principle, does not impose a restriction on how a node branches.

When it comes to the head and the complement, their relative order is determined based on the principles-and-parameters model of language, more specifically by the head parameter (not by the X-bar schema itself). A principle is a shared, invariable rule of grammar across languages, whereas a parameter is a typologically variable aspect of the grammars. One can either set their parameter with the values of &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot;: In the case of the head parameter, one configures the parameter of [±head first], depending on what language they primarily speak. If this parameter is configured to be [+head first], what results is head-initial languages such as English, and if it is configured to be [-head first], what results is head-final languages such as Japanese. For example, the English sentence &quot;John ate an apple&quot; and its corresponding Japanese sentence have the structures in Figure 8 and Figure 9, respectively.


Finally the directionality of the specifier node is in essence unspecified as well, although this is subject to debate: Some argue that the relevant node is necessarily left-branching across languages, the idea of which is (partially) motivated by the fact that both English and Japanese have subjects on the left of a VP, whereas others such as Saito and Fukui (1998) argue that the directionality of the node is not fixed and needs to be externally determined, for example by the head parameter.

== Structure of sentence ==
=== Structure of S ===
Under the PSR, the structure of S (sentence) is illustrated as follows.
* S → NP (Aux) VP
However, this structure violates the headedness principle because it has an exocentric, headless structure, and would also violate the binarity principle if an Aux (auxiliary) occurs, because the S node will then be ternary-branching. Given these, Chomsky (1981) proposed that S is an InflP headed by the functional category Infl(ection), and later in Chomsky (1986a), this category was relabelled as I (hence constitutes an IP), following the notational convention that phrasal categories are represented in the form of XP, with two letters. The category I includes auxiliary verbs such as &quot;will&quot; and &quot;can&quot;, clitics such as &quot;-s&quot; of the third person singular present and &quot;-ed&quot; of the past tense. This is consistent with the headedness principle, which requires that a phrase have a head, because a sentence (or a clause) necessarily involves an element that determines the inflection of a verb.

Assuming that S constitutes an IP, the structure of the sentence &quot;John studies linguistics at the university&quot;, for example, can be illustrated as in Figure 10.

As is obvious, the IP hypothesis makes it possible to regard the grammatical unit of sentence as a phrasal category. It is also important that the configuration in Figure 10 is fully compatible with the central assumptions of the X-bar theory, namely the headedness principle and the binarity principle.

=== Structure of S&#x27; ===
Words that introduce subordinate or complement clauses are called complementizers, and representative of them are &quot;that&quot;, &quot;if&quot;, and &quot;for.&quot; Under the PSR, complement clauses were assumed to constitute the category S&#x27;.
* S&#x27; → COMP S
Chomsky (1986a) proposed that this category is in fact a CP headed by the functional category C. The sentence &quot;I think that John is honest&quot;, for example, then has the following structure.

Moreover, Chomsky (1986a) assumes that the landing site of wh-movement is the specifier position of CP (Spec-CP). Accordingly, the wh-question &quot;What did John eat?&quot;, for example, is derived as in Figure 12.

In this derivation, the I-to-C movement is an instance of subject-auxiliary inversion (SAI), or more generally, head movement.

=== Other phrasal structures ===
* VP-internal subject hypothesis: A hypothesis on the inner structure of VP proposed by researchers such as Fukui and Speas (1986) and Kitagawa (1986). It assumes that the sentential subject is base-generated in Spec-VP, not in Spec-IP.
* DP Hypothesis: A hypothesis proposed by Abney (1987), according to whom noun phrases are not NPs but DPs headed by the functional category D.
* VP shell: An analysis put forth by Larson (1988), which assumes two-layered structures of VP. Later in Chomsky (1995a, 1995b), the higher VP was replaced by &quot;v&quot;P headed by the functional category &quot;v&quot; (little/small v, traditionally written in italics).
* PredP Hypothesis: A hypothesis proposed by Bowers (1993, 2001), according to whom small clauses are PredPs headed by the functional category Pred.
* Bare Phrase Structure (BPS): A replacement of the X-bar theory put forth by Chomsky (1995a, 1995b). It dispenses with a &quot;template&quot; structure like the X-bar schema, and yields syntactic structures by (iterative applications of) an operation called Merge, which serves to connect two syntactic objects such as words and phrases into one. Some radical versions of it even reject syntactic category labels such as V and A. See also Minimalist Program.
== Hierarchical structure ==
The PSR has the shortcoming of being incapable of capturing sentence ambiguities.
* I saw a man with binoculars.
This sentence is ambiguous between the reading &quot;I saw a man, using binoculars&quot;, in which &quot;with binoculars&quot; modifies the VP, and the reading &quot;I saw a man who had binoculars&quot;, in which the PP modifies the NP. Under the PSR model, the sentence above is subject to the following two parsing rules.
* S → NP VP
* VP → V NP PP
The sentence&#x27;s structure under these PSRs would be as in Figure 13.

It is obvious that this structure fails to capture the NP modification reading because [PP with binoculars] modifies the VP no matter how one tries to illustrate the structure. The X-bar theory, however, successfully captures the ambiguity as demonstrated in the configurations in Figure 14 and 15 below, because it assumes hierarchical structures in accordance with the binarity principle.

Thus, the X-bar theory resolves the fourth issue mentioned in as well. There is always a unilateral relation from syntax to semantics (never from semantics to syntax) in any version of generative grammar because syntactic computation starts from the lexicon, then continues into the syntax, then into Logical Form (LF) at which meanings are computed. This is so under any of Standard Theory (Chomsky, 1965), Extended Standard Theory (Chomsky, 1972), and Revised Extended Standard Theory (Chomsky, 1981).

<text>George Balanchine (; born Georgiy Melitonovich Balanchivadze; April 30, 1983) was a Georgian-American ballet choreographer, recognized as one of the most influential choreographers of the 20th-century. Styled as the father of American ballet, he co-founded the New York City Ballet and remained its artistic director for more than 35 years. His choreography is characterized by plotless ballets with minimal costume and décor, performed to classical and neoclassical music.

Born in St. Petersburg, Russia, Balanchine took the standards and technique from his time at the Imperial Ballet School and fused it with other schools of movement that he had adopted during his tenure on Broadway and in Hollywood, creating his signature &quot;neoclassical style&quot;.

He was a choreographer known for his musicality; he expressed music with dance and worked extensively with leading composers of his time like Igor Stravinsky. Balanchine was invited to America in 1933 by a young arts patron named Lincoln Kirstein, and together they founded the School of American Ballet in 1934 as well as the New York City Ballet in 1948.

==Early life and family==
Balanchine was born Georgiy Melitonovich Balanchivadze in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, son of Georgian opera singer and composer Meliton Balanchivadze, one of the founders of the Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre. His father was later the Minister of Culture of the Georgian Democratic Republic, which became independent in 1918 but was later forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union.

The rest of the Georgian side of Balanchine&#x27;s family consisted largely of artists and soldiers. Little is known of Balanchine&#x27;s Russian, maternal side. His mother, Meliton&#x27;s second wife, Maria Nikolayevna Vasilyeva, is said to be the daughter of Nikolai von Almedingen, a German. He later left Russia and abandoned his family, causing Maria to take her mother&#x27;s name. Maria was fond of ballet and viewed it as a form of social advancement from the lower reaches of Saint Petersburg society. She was eleven years younger than Meliton and rumored to have been his former housekeeper, although &quot;she had at least some culture in her background&quot; as she could play piano well. Maria also worked at a bank. 

Although she loved ballet, she wanted her son to join the military. This was a difficult topic to enforce in the family because not only was the mother artistic, George&#x27;s father was also very talented at playing the piano. Many believe that because his father was very invested in the arts, Balanchine&#x27;s career of being a businessman failed. Balanchine had three other siblings. His brother Andrei Balanchivadze became a well-known Georgian composer like their father.

Even after immigrating to the United States, Balanchine tried to stay connected to his Georgian roots. He engaged across the Iron Curtain with Georgian artists, who admired him.

==Career==
===Early auditions and training===
As a child, Balanchine was not particularly interested in ballet, but his mother insisted that he audition with his sister Tamara, who shared her mother&#x27;s interest in the art. Balanchine&#x27;s brother Andria Balanchivadze followed their father&#x27;s love for music and became a composer in Soviet Georgia. Tamara&#x27;s life as a dancer, however, would be cut short by her death in unknown circumstances as she was trying to escape to Georgia on a train from the Siege of Leningrad during World War II.

Based on his audition, during 1913 (at age nine), Balanchine relocated from rural Finland to Saint Petersburg and was accepted into the Imperial Ballet School, principal school of the Imperial Ballet, where he was a student of Pavel Gerdt and Samuil Andrianov (Gerdt&#x27;s son-in-law).

Balanchine studied dance at the Mariinsky School &amp; Theater until it closed down in 1917 due to government decree. His taking ballet here could have been viewed as a convenience to the Balanchivadze family, because this is where his father composed music. After the Revolution, this theater was transferred to the People&#x27;s Enlightenment Commissariat and became property of the state. The Theater reopened in 1918; two years later it was renamed as the State Academic Theater of Opera and Ballet. 

Balanchine had begun to choreograph and mounted some new and experimental ballets for the Mikhailovsky Theatre in Petrograd (as the city was renamed. It later was renamed again as Leningrad.) Among them were &quot;Le Boeuf sur le toit&quot; (1920), by Jean Cocteau and music by Darius Milhaud. He also created a piece for &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; by Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw.

After graduating in 1921, Balanchine enrolled in the Petrograd Conservatory while working in the corps de ballet at the State Academic Theater for Opera and Ballet. (This was formerly the State Theater of Opera and Ballet and known as the Mariinsky Ballet). His studies at the conservatory included advanced piano, music theory, counterpoint, harmony, and composition. Balanchine graduated from the conservatory in 1923, and danced as a member of the corps until 1924. While still in his teens, Balanchine choreographed his first work, a pas de deux named &quot;La Nuit&quot; (1920, music by Anton Rubinstein). a piece which The school of directors did not approve of or like this work. 

Balanchine worked at his choreography in an experimental way during his evenings. He and his colleagues eventually performed this piece at the State School of Ballet. This was followed by another duet, &quot;Enigma&quot;, with the dancers in bare feet rather than ballet shoes. While teaching at the Mariinsky Ballet, he met Tamara Geva, his future wife. In 1923, with Geva and fellow dancers, Balanchine formed a small ensemble, &quot;The Young Ballet&quot;.

===Ballets Russes===
In 1924, &quot;the Young Ballet&quot; managed to obtain a permission to leave Soviet Russia and tour around Europe. Balanchine with his wife, Tamara Geva, and several other dancers (Alexandra Danilova, Nicholas Efimov) went to Germany, but their performances in Berlin received a chilly response. &quot;The Young Ballet&quot; had to perform in small cities of the Rhine Province such as Wiesbaden, Bad Ems, and Moselle. Geva wrote later, that in that time they had to dance &#x27;in small dark places, in summer theaters and private ballrooms, in beer gardens and before mental patients&#x27;. They could barely afford paying for hotels and often had only tea for a meal. In London, they had two weeks of very unsuccessful performances, when the audience met them with dead silence. With expiring visas, they were not welcome in any other European country. The young dancers settled in Paris, where there was a large Russian emigre community. 

At this time, the Russian impresario Sergei Diaghilev invited Balanchine to join the Ballets Russes as a choreographer. Balanchine was 21 and became the main choreographer for the most famous ballet company in Europe. Sergei Diaghilev insisted that Balanchine change his name from Balanchivadze to Balanchine. Diaghilev soon promoted Balanchine to ballet master of the company and encouraged his choreography.

Between 1924 and Diaghilev&#x27;s death in 1929, Balanchine created ten ballets, as well as lesser works. During these years, he worked with rising young composers such as Sergei Prokofiev, Igor Stravinsky, Erik Satie, and Maurice Ravel, and artists who designed sets and costumes, such as Pablo Picasso, Georges Rouault, and Henri Matisse, creating new works that combined all the arts.
Among his new works, during 1928 in Paris, Balanchine premiered &quot;Apollon musagète&quot; (Apollo and the muses) in a collaboration with Stravinsky. This was one of his most innovative ballets, combining classical ballet and classical Greek myth and images with jazz movement. He described it as &quot;the turning point in my life&quot;. &quot;Apollo&quot; is regarded as the original neoclassical ballet. &quot;Apollo&quot; brought the male dancer to the forefront, giving him two solos within the ballet. &quot;Apollo&quot; is known for its minimalism, using simple costumes and sets. This allowed the audience not to be distracted from the movement. Balanchine considered music to be the primary influence on choreography, as opposed to the narrative.

Due to a serious knee injury, Balanchine had to limit his dancing, effectively ending his own performance career. So he decided to focus all his attention on choreography.

After Diaghilev&#x27;s death, the Ballets Russes went bankrupt. To earn money, Balanchine began to stage dances for Charles B. Cochran&#x27;s revues and Sir Oswald Stoll&#x27;s variety shows in London. He was retained by the Royal Danish Ballet in Copenhagen as a guest ballet master. Among his new works for the company were &quot;Danses Concertantes&quot;, a pure dance piece to music by Stravinsky, and &quot;Night Shadow&quot;, revived under the title &quot;La Sonnambula&quot;.

In 1931, with the help of financier Serge Denham, René Blum and Colonel Wassily de Basil formed the Ballets Russes de Monte-Carlo, a successor to Ballets Russes. The new company hired Leonide Massine and Balanchine as choreographers. Featured dancers included David Lichine and Tatiana Riabouchinska. In 1933, without consulting Blum, Col. de Basil dropped Balanchine after one year, – ostensibly because he thought that audiences preferred the works choreographed by Massine. Librettist Boris Kochno was also let go, while dancer Tamara Toumanova (a strong admirer of Balanchine) left the company when Balanchine was fired.

Balanchine and Kochno immediately founded Les Ballets 1933. Kochno, Diaghilev&#x27;s former secretary and companion, served as artistic advisor. The company was financed by Edward James, a British poet and ballet patron. The company lasted only a couple of months during 1933, performing in Paris and London. The worldwide Great Depression made arts more difficult to fund. Balanchine created several new works, including collaborations with composers Kurt Weill, Darius Milhaud, Henri Sauguet and designer Pavel Tchelitchew.

===United States===

Balanchine moved to the United States in 1933 at the behest of Lincoln Kirstein. Balanchine insisted that his first project in the United States would be to establish a ballet school, because he wanted to develop dancers who had strong technique along with his particular style. Compared to his classical training, he thought American dancers lacked strength and skills. With the assistance of Lincoln Kirstein and Edward M.M. Warburg, the School of American Ballet opened to students on January 2, 1934, less than three months after Balanchine arrived in the U.S. 

Later that year, Balanchine had his students perform in a recital, where they premiered his new work &quot;Serenade&quot; to music by Tchaikovsky at Woodlands, the Warburg summer estate. It became part of the Canon of the company.

In 1948, Balanchine and Kirstein founded the New York City Ballet. The school of American Ballet became and is now a training ground for dancers of New York City Ballet and companies from all over the world.

Between his ballet activities in the 1930s and 1940s, Balanchine also choreographed Broadway musicals written by such notables as Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart and Vernon Duke. Among them, Balanchine choreographed Rodgers and Hart&#x27;s &quot;On Your Toes&quot; in 1936, where his program billing specified &quot;Choreography by George Balanchine&quot; as opposed to the usual billing of &quot;Dances staged by&quot;. This marked the first time in Broadway history that a dance-maker received choreography billing for a Broadway musical. &quot;On Your Toes&quot; featured two ballets: &quot;La Princesse Zenobia&quot; and &quot;Slaughter on Tenth Avenue&quot;, in which a tap dancer falls in love with a dance-hall girl. Balanchine&#x27;s choreography in musicals was unique at the time because it furthered the plot of the story.

===Relocation to West Coast===

Balanchine relocated his company to Hollywood in 1938, where he rented a white two-story house with &quot;Kolya&quot;, Nicholas Kopeikine, his &quot;rehearsal pianist and lifelong colleague&quot;, on North Fairfax Avenue not far from Hollywood Boulevard. Balanchine created dances for five movies, all of which featured Vera Zorina, whom he met on the set of &quot;The Goldwyn Follies&quot; and who subsequently became his second wife. He reconvened the company as the American Ballet Caravan and toured with it throughout North and South America, but it folded after several years. From 1944 to 1946, during and after World War II, Balanchine served as resident choreographer for Blum &amp; Massine&#x27;s new iteration of Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo.

===Return to New York===
Soon Balanchine formed a new dance company, Ballet Society, again with the generous help of Lincoln Kirstein. He continued to work with contemporary composers such as Paul Hindemith, from whom he commissioned a score in 1940 for &quot;The Four Temperaments&quot;. First performed on November 20, 1946, this modernist work was one of his early abstract and spare ballets, angular and very different in movement. After several successful performances, the most notable featuring the ballet &quot;Orpheus&quot; created in collaboration with Stravinsky and sculptor and designer Isamu Noguchi, the City of New York offered the company residency at New York City Center.

In 1954, Balanchine created his version of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, in which he played the mime role of Drosselmeyer. The company has since performed the ballet every year in New York City during the Christmas season. His other famous ballets created for New York companies include &quot;Firebird&quot;, &quot;Allegro Brilliante&quot;, &quot;Agon&quot;, &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot;, and &quot;Episodes&quot;.
In 1967, Balanchine&#x27;s ballet &quot;Jewels&quot; displayed specific characteristics of Balanchine&#x27;s choreography. The corps de ballet dancers execute rapid footwork and precise movements. The choreography is difficult to execute and all dancers must do their jobs to hold the integrity of the piece. Balanchine&#x27;s use of musicality can also be seen in this work. His other famous works with New York City Ballet are popular today and are performed in the Lincoln Center by New York City Ballet: &quot;Mozartiana&quot;, &quot;Apollo&quot;, &quot;Orpheus&quot;, and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

===Death===
In his last years, Balanchine had angina pectoris and underwent heart bypass surgery.

After years of illness, Balanchine died on April 30, 1983, aged 79, in Manhattan from Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. This was diagnosed only after his death. He first showed symptoms during 1978 when he began losing his balance while dancing. As the disease progressed, his equilibrium, eyesight, and hearing deteriorated. By 1982, he was incapacitated.

The night of his death, the company went on with its scheduled performance, which included &quot;Divertimento No. 15&quot; and &quot;Symphony in C&quot; at Lincoln Center.

Clement Crisp, one of the many writers who eulogized Balanchine, assessed his contribution: &quot;It is hard to think of the ballet world without the colossal presence of George Balanchine ...&quot; In his lifetime he created 465 works. Balanchine extended the traditions of classical ballet. His choreography remains the same to the present day and the School of American Ballet still uses his teaching technique. As one of the 20th century&#x27;s best-known choreographers, his style and vision of ballet is interesting to many generations of choreographers.

Having kept his faith, he had a Russian Orthodox funeral. He was interred at the Oakland Cemetery at Sag Harbor, Suffolk County, New York. Alexandra Danilova was also later interred here.

== The Balanchine Style ==
Starting out his professional career with opera ballets, Balanchine did not take classicism as the a priori theory, but instead searched for his own style through the 1930s. It is widely accepted that Balanchine had established the American ballet style, and the Neoclassical style that Balanchine consolidated represents the American spirit.

=== Straying away from the European traditions ===
While the European classical ballet often creates a fantasy world filled with &quot;magic sylphs and swans&quot;, Balanchine diverted from the traditional story-telling method and let dancers just be dancers who showcase their artistic ability through movements. Throughout Balanchine&#x27;s career, he created many neoclassical leotard ballets in which dancers perform in simple leotards rather than excessive costumes. Balanchine&#x27;s removal of characters, storytelling, and costumes bring ballet back into reality to redefine the beauty of dance in its purest form. As the formalist David Michael Levin commented, &quot;Balanchine has mastered the deepest logic of this intrinsic, expressive power of the human body&quot;.

=== African Influence &amp; Elements ===
Although ballet has been seen as a white European art form, scholars pointed out the African influence in Balanchine&#x27;s work, marking the African presence in American ballet.

Moving to the United States, Balanchine was close to African American artists such as Katherine Dunham. According to dancers who worked with Balanchine such as Arthur Mitchell who comes from an African background, Balanchine would send students to Dunham or have dancers with an African background demonstrate skills common in African dance.

The displacement of hips instead of vertical alignment, angular arms and flexed wrists, and the non-traditional timing of movements are the several key elements in Balanchine&#x27;s works that scholars identify as developed under the African influence.

Incorporating of African elements and dancers from an African cultural background made Balanchine&#x27;s works American. The phenomenon of cultural influences and combinations in his works represent the diversity in the American society.

== Personal life ==
In 1923, Balanchine married Tamara Geva, a sixteen-year-old dancer. After later parting ways with Geva, he became romantically involved with the ballerina Alexandra Danilova, from approximately 1924 to 1931. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; described their relationship in its obituary for Danilova: &quot;She and Balanchine left the Soviet Union in 1924... Until 1931, she and Balanchine lived together as husband and wife, although they were never married. Balanchine was still officially married to another dancer, Tamara Geva, and he told Miss Danilova that because his marriage papers had been left behind in Russia, he feared it might be difficult to arrange a legal separation.&quot; He married and divorced three more times, all to women who were his dancers: Vera Zorina (1938–1946), Maria Tallchief (1946–1952), and Tanaquil LeClercq (1952–1969). He had no children by any of his marriages and no known offspring from any of his extramarital liaisons.

Biographer and intellectual historian Clive James has argued that Balanchine, despite his creative genius and brilliance as a ballet choreographer, had his darker side. In his &quot;Cultural Amnesia: Necessary Memories from History and the Arts&quot; (2007), James writes that:
==Legacy and honors==

With his School of American Ballet, New York City Ballet, and 400 choreographed works, Balanchine transformed American dance and created neoclassical ballet, developing a unique style with his dancers highlighted by brilliant speed and attack.

A monument at the Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre in Georgia was dedicated in Balanchine&#x27;s memory. A crater on Mercury was named in his honor.

George Balanchine Way is a segment of West 63rd Street (located between Columbus Avenue and Broadway) in New York City that was renamed in his honor in June 1990.

Playwright Richard Nelson wrote &quot;Nikolai and the Others&quot;, produced at the Mitzi Newhouse theater at Lincoln Center in 2013 with Michael Cerveris as Balanchine.

=== As the Teacher ===
Apart from his legacy in establishing the American-style ballet, Balanchine also contributed to the ballet education in the United States. Upon his arrival in the United States in 1933, Balanchine sensed the urgency of establishing an institutionalized ballet school to deliver systematic training in ballet.

Established in 1934, the School of American Ballet was taught based on the Russian ballet style Balanchine once received himself with his own alternations. Balanchine&#x27;s pedagogues focused on clarity and breadth of motion, sharpness of nuance, and intensity of image.

Balanchine&#x27;s lessons delivered were not set in stone, but instead an evolving glossary: he continuous tested his concepts on the stage, and renewed his teaching from time to time to reflect the most up-to-date ideal concepts.

<text>A non-standard cosmology is any physical cosmological model of the universe that was, or still is, proposed as an alternative to the then-current standard model of cosmology. The term &quot;non-standard&quot; is applied to any theory that does not conform to the scientific consensus. Because the term depends on the prevailing consensus, the meaning of the term changes over time. For example, hot dark matter would not have been considered non-standard in 1990, but would have been in 2010. Conversely, a non-zero cosmological constant resulting in an accelerating universe would have been considered non-standard in 1990, but is part of the standard cosmology in 2010.

Several major cosmological disputes have occurred throughout the history of cosmology. One of the earliest was the Copernican Revolution, which established the heliocentric model of the Solar System. More recent was the Great Debate of 1920, in the aftermath of which the Milky Way&#x27;s status as but one of the Universe&#x27;s many galaxies was established. From the 1940s to the 1960s, the astrophysical community was equally divided between supporters of the Big Bang theory and supporters of a rival steady state universe; this is currently decided in favour of the Big Bang theory by advances in observational cosmology in the late 1960s. Nevertheless, there remained vocal detractors of the Big Bang theory including Fred Hoyle, Jayant Narlikar, Halton Arp, and Hannes Alfvén, whose cosmologies were relegated to the fringes of astronomical research. The few Big Bang opponents still active today often ignore well-established evidence from newer research, and as a consequence, today non-standard cosmologies that reject the Big Bang entirely are rarely published in peer-reviewed science journals but appear online in marginal journals and private websites.

The current standard model of cosmology is the Lambda-CDM model, wherein the Universe is governed by general relativity, began with a Big Bang and today is a nearly-flat universe that consists of approximately 5% baryons, 27% cold dark matter, and 68% dark energy. Lambda-CDM has been a successful model, but recent observational evidence seem to indicate significant tensions in Lambda-CDM, such as the Hubble tension, the KBC void, the dwarf galaxy problem, ultra-large structures, et cetera. Research on extensions or modifications to Lambda-CDM, as well as fundamentally different models, is ongoing. Topics investigated include quintessence, Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and its relativistic generalization TeVeS, and warm dark matter.

==History==
Modern physical cosmology as it is currently studied first emerged as a scientific discipline in the period after the Shapley–Curtis debate and discoveries by Edwin Hubble of a cosmic distance ladder when astronomers and physicists had to come to terms with a universe that was of a much larger scale than the previously assumed galactic size. Theorists who successfully developed cosmologies applicable to the larger-scale universe are remembered today as the founders of modern cosmology. Among these scientists are Arthur Milne, Willem de Sitter, Alexander Friedman, Georges Lemaître, and Albert Einstein himself.

After confirmation of the Hubble&#x27;s law by observation, the two most popular cosmological theories became the Steady State theory of Hoyle, Gold and Bondi, and the big bang theory of Ralph Alpher, George Gamow, and Robert Dicke with a small number of supporters of a smattering of alternatives. One of the major successes of the Big Bang theory compared to its competitor was its prediction for the abundance of light elements in the universe that corresponds with the observed abundances of light elements. Alternative theories do not have a means to explain these abundances.

Theories which assert that the universe has an infinite age with no beginning have trouble accounting for the abundance of deuterium in the cosmos, because deuterium easily undergoes nuclear fusion in stars and there are no known astrophysical processes other than the Big Bang itself that can produce it in large quantities. Hence the fact that deuterium is not an extremely rare component of the universe suggests both that the universe has a finite age and that there was a process that created deuterium in the past that no longer occurs.

Theories which assert that the universe has a finite life, but that the Big Bang did not happen, have problems with the abundance of helium-4. The observed amount of 4He is far larger than the amount that should have been created via stars or any other known process. By contrast, the abundance of 4He in Big Bang models is very insensitive to assumptions about baryon density, changing only a few percent as the baryon density changes by several orders of magnitude. The observed value of 4He is within the range calculated.

Still, it was not until the discovery of the Cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson in 1965, that most cosmologists finally concluded that observations were best explained by the big bang model. Steady State theorists and other non-standard cosmologies were then tasked with providing an explanation for the phenomenon if they were to remain plausible. This led to original approaches including integrated starlight and cosmic iron whiskers, which were meant to provide a source for a pervasive, all-sky microwave background that was not due to an early universe phase transition.

Scepticism about the non-standard cosmologies&#x27; ability to explain the CMB caused interest in the subject to wane since then, however, there have been two periods in which interest in non-standard cosmology has increased due to observational data which posed difficulties for the big bang. The first occurred in the late 1970s when there were a number of unsolved problems, such as the horizon problem, the flatness problem, and the lack of magnetic monopoles, which challenged the big bang model. These issues were eventually resolved by cosmic inflation in the 1980s. This idea subsequently became part of the understanding of the big bang, although alternatives have been proposed from time to time. The second occurred in the mid-1990s when observations of the ages of globular clusters and the primordial helium abundance, apparently disagreed with the big bang. However, by the late 1990s, most astronomers had concluded that these observations did not challenge the big bang and additional data from COBE and the WMAP, provided detailed quantitative measures which were consistent with standard cosmology.

Today, heterodox non-standard cosmologies are generally considered unworthy of consideration by cosmologists while many of the historically significant nonstandard cosmologies are considered to have been falsified. The essentials of the big bang theory have been confirmed by a wide range of complementary and detailed observations, and no non-standard cosmologies have reproduced the range of successes of the big bang model. Speculations about alternatives are not normally part of research or pedagogical discussions, except as object lessons or for their historical importance. An open letter started by some remaining advocates of non-standard cosmology has affirmed that: &quot;today, virtually all financial and experimental resources in cosmology are devoted to big bang studies...&quot;

In the 1990s, a dawning of a &quot;golden age of cosmology&quot; was accompanied by a startling discovery that the expansion of the universe was, in fact, accelerating. Previous to this, it had been assumed that matter either in its visible or invisible dark matter form was the dominant energy density in the universe. This &quot;classical&quot; big bang cosmology was overthrown when it was discovered that nearly 70% of the energy in the universe was attributable to the cosmological constant, often referred to as &quot;dark energy&quot;. This has led to the development of a so-called concordance ΛCDM model which combines detailed data obtained with new telescopes and techniques in observational astrophysics with an expanding, density-changing universe. Today, it is more common to find in the scientific literature proposals for &quot;non-standard cosmologies&quot; that actually accept the basic tenets of the big bang cosmology, while modifying parts of the concordance model. Such theories include alternative models of dark energy, such as quintessence, phantom energy and some ideas in brane cosmology; alternative models of dark matter, such as modified Newtonian dynamics; alternatives or extensions to inflation such as chaotic inflation and the ekpyrotic model; and proposals to supplement the universe with a first cause, such as the Hartle–Hawking boundary condition, the cyclic model, and the string landscape. There is no consensus about these ideas amongst cosmologists, but they are nonetheless active fields of academic inquiry.

== Alternatives to Big Bang cosmologies ==
Before observational evidence was gathered, theorists developed frameworks based on what they understood to be the most general features of physics and philosophical assumptions about the universe. When Albert Einstein developed his general theory of relativity in 1915, this was used as a mathematical starting point for most cosmological theories. In order to arrive at a cosmological model, however, theoreticians needed to make assumptions about the nature of the largest scales of the universe. The assumptions that the current standard model of cosmology relies upon are:

# the universality of physical laws – that the laws of physics do not change from one place and time to another,
# the cosmological principle – that the universe is roughly homogeneous and isotropic in space though not necessarily in time, and
# the Copernican principle – that we are not observing the universe from a preferred locale.

These assumptions when combined with General Relativity result in a universe that is governed by the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker metric (FRW metric). The FRW metric allows for a universe that is either expanding or contracting (as well as stationary but unstable universes). When Hubble&#x27;s law was discovered, most astronomers interpreted the law as a sign the universe is expanding. This implies the universe was smaller in the past, and therefore led to the following conclusions:

# the universe emerged from a hot, dense state at a time in the past,
# because the universe heats up as it contracts and cools as it expands, in the first minutes that time existed as we know it, the temperatures were high enough for Big Bang nucleosynthesis to occur, and
# a cosmic microwave background pervading the entire universe should exist, which is a record of a phase transition that occurred when the atoms of the universe first formed.

These features were derived by numerous individuals over a period of years; indeed it was not until the middle of the twentieth century that accurate predictions of the last feature and observations confirming its existence were made. Non-standard theories developed either by starting from different assumptions or by contradicting the features predicted by the prevailing standard model of cosmology.

===Steady State theories===

The Steady State theory extends the homogeneity assumption of the cosmological principle to reflect a homogeneity in time as well as in space. This &quot;perfect cosmological principle&quot; as it would come to be called asserted that the universe looks the same everywhere (on the large scale), the same as it always has and always will. This is in contrast to Lambda-CDM, in which the universe looked very different in the past and will look very different in the future. Steady State theory was proposed in 1948 by Fred Hoyle, Thomas Gold, Hermann Bondi and others. In order to maintain the perfect cosmological principle in an expanding universe, steady state cosmology had to posit a &quot;matter-creation field&quot; (the so-called C-field) that would insert matter into the universe in order to maintain a constant density.

The debate between the Big Bang and the Steady State models would happen for 15 years with camps roughly evenly divided until the discovery of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. This radiation is a natural feature of the Big Bang model which demands a &quot;time of last scattering&quot; where photons decouple with baryonic matter. The Steady State model proposed that this radiation could be accounted for by so-called &quot;integrated starlight&quot; which was a background caused in part by Olbers&#x27; paradox in an infinite universe. In order to account for the uniformity of the background, steady state proponents posited a fog effect associated with microscopic iron particles that would scatter radio waves in such a manner as to produce an isotropic CMB. The proposed phenomena was whimsically named &quot;cosmic iron whiskers&quot; and served as the thermalization mechanism. The Steady State theory did not have the horizon problem of the Big Bang because it assumed an infinite amount of time was available for thermalizing the background.

As more cosmological data began to be collected, cosmologists began to realize that the Big Bang correctly predicted the abundance of light elements observed in the cosmos. What was a coincidental ratio of hydrogen to deuterium and helium in the steady state model was a feature of the Big Bang model. Additionally, detailed measurements of the CMB since the 1990s with the COBE, WMAP and Planck observations indicated that the spectrum of the background was closer to a blackbody than any other source in nature. The best integrated starlight models could predict was a thermalization to the level of 10% while the COBE satellite measured the deviation at one part in 105. After this dramatic discovery, the majority of cosmologists became convinced that the steady state theory could not explain the observed CMB properties.

Although the original steady state model is now considered to be contrary to observations (particularly the CMB) even by its one-time supporters, modifications of the steady state model have been proposed, including a model that envisions the universe as originating through many little bangs rather than one big bang (the so-called &quot;quasi-steady state cosmology&quot;). It supposes that the universe goes through periodic expansion and contraction phases, with a soft &quot;rebound&quot; in place of the Big Bang. Thus the Hubble law is explained by the fact that the universe is currently in an expansion phase. Work continues on this model (most notably by Jayant V. Narlikar), although it has not gained widespread mainstream acceptance.

== Alternatives and extensions to Lambda-CDM ==
The standard model of cosmology today, the Lambda-CDM model, has been extremely successful at providing a theoretical framework for structure formation, the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background, and the accelerating expansion of the universe. However, it is not without its problems. There are many proposals today that challenge various aspects of the Lambda-CDM model. These proposals typically modify some of the main features of Lambda-CDM, but do not reject the Big Bang.

===Anisotropic universe===

Isotropicity – the idea that the universe looks the same in all directions – is one of the core assumptions that enters into the Friedmann equations. In 2008 however, scientists working on the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data claimed to have detected a 600–1000 km/s flow of clusters toward a 20-degree patch of sky between the constellations of Centaurus and Vela. They suggested that the motion may be a remnant of the influence of no-longer-visible regions of the universe prior to inflation. The detection is controversial, and other scientists have found that the universe is isotropic to a great degree.

===Massive compact halo object (MACHO)===
Solitary black holes, neutron stars, burnt-out dwarf stars, and other massive objects that are hard to detect are collectively known as MACHOs; some scientists initially hoped that baryonic MACHOs could account for and explain all the dark matter. However, evidence has accumulated that these objects cannot explain a large fraction of the dark matter mass.

===Exotic dark matter ===

In Lambda-CDM, dark matter is a form of matter that interacts with both ordinary matter and light only through gravitational effects. To produce the large-scale structure we see today, dark matter is &quot;cold&quot; (the &#x27;C&#x27; in Lambda-CDM), i.e. non-relativistic. Dark matter has not been conclusively identified, and its exact nature is the subject of intense study. Hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), axions and primordial black holes are the leading dark matter candidates but there are a variety of other proposals, e.g.:

*Self-interacting dark matter, wherein dark matter particles interact with themselves.
*Warm dark matter, which are more relativistic than cold dark matter, but less relativistic than the observationally-excluded hot dark matter.
*Fuzzy cold dark matter, which have particles much lighter than axions – in the 10−22 eV range.

Yet other theories attempt to explain dark matter and dark energy as different facets of the same underlying fluid (see dark fluid), or hypothesize that dark matter could decay into dark energy.

===Exotic dark energy===


In Lambda-CDM, dark energy is an unknown form of energy that tends to accelerate the expansion of the universe. It is less well-understood than dark matter, and similarly mysterious. The simplest explanation of dark energy is the cosmological constant (the &#x27;Lambda&#x27; in Lambda-CDM). This is a simple constant added to the Einstein field equations to provide a repulsive force. Thus far observations are fully consistent with the cosmological constant, but leave room for a plethora of alternatives, e.g.:

*Quintessence, which is a scalar field similar to the one that drove cosmic inflation shortly after the Big Bang. In quintessence, dark energy will usually vary over time (as opposed to the cosmological constant, which remains a constant).
*Inhomogeneous cosmology. One of the fundamental assumptions of Lambda-CDM is that the universe is homogeneous – that is, it looks broadly the same regardless of where the observer is. In the inhomogeneous universe scenario, the observed dark energy is a measurement artefact caused by us being located at an emptier-than-average region of space.
*Variable dark energy, which is similar to quintessence in that the properties of dark energy vary over time (see figure), but different in that dark energy is not due to a scalar field.

== Alternatives to general relativity ==

General relativity, upon which the FRW metric is based, is an extremely successful theory which has met every observational test so far. However, at a fundamental level it is incompatible with quantum mechanics, and by predicting singularities, it also predicts its own breakdown. Any alternative theory of gravity would immediately imply an alternative cosmological theory since Lambda-CDM is dependent on general relativity as a framework assumption. There are many different motivations to modify general relativity, such as to eliminate the need for dark matter or dark energy, or to avoid such paradoxes as the firewall.

There are very many modified gravity theories, none of which have gained widespread acceptance, although it remains an active field of research. Some of the more notable theories are below.

=== Machian universe ===

Ernst Mach developed a kind of extension to general relativity which proposed that inertia was due to gravitational effects of the mass distribution of the universe. This led naturally to speculation about the cosmological implications for such a proposal. Carl Brans and Robert Dicke were able to incorporate Mach&#x27;s principle into general relativity which admitted for cosmological solutions that would imply a variable mass. The homogeneously distributed mass of the universe would result in a roughly scalar field that permeated the universe and would serve as a source for Newton&#x27;s gravitational constant; creating a theory of quantum gravity.

=== MOND ===

Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is a relatively modern proposal to explain the galaxy rotation problem based on a variation of Newton&#x27;s Second Law of Dynamics at low accelerations. This would produce a large-scale variation of Newton&#x27;s universal theory of gravity. A modification of Newton&#x27;s theory would also imply a modification of general relativistic cosmology in as much as Newtonian cosmology is the limit of Friedman cosmology. While almost all astrophysicists today reject MOND in favor of dark matter, a small number of researchers continue to enhance it, recently incorporating Brans–Dicke theories into treatments that attempt to account for cosmological observations.

Tensor–vector–scalar gravity (TeVeS) is a proposed relativistic theory that is equivalent to Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) in the non-relativistic limit, which purports to explain the galaxy rotation problem without invoking dark matter. Originated by Jacob Bekenstein in 2004, it incorporates various dynamical and non-dynamical tensor fields, vector fields and scalar fields.

The break-through of TeVeS over MOND is that it can explain the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, a cosmic optical illusion in which matter bends light, which has been confirmed many times. A recent preliminary finding is that it can explain structure formation without CDM, but requiring a ~2eV massive neutrino (they are also required to fit some Clusters of galaxies, including the Bullet Cluster). However, other authors (see Slosar, Melchiorri and Silk) argue that TeVeS can not explain cosmic microwave background anisotropies and structure formation at the same time, i.e. ruling out those models at high significance.

=== gravity ===

 gravity is a family of theories that modify general relativity by defining a different function of the Ricci scalar (). The simplest case is just the function being equal to the scalar; this is general relativity. As a consequence of introducing an arbitrary function, there may be freedom to explain the accelerated expansion and structure formation of the Universe without adding unknown forms of dark energy or dark matter. Some functional forms may be inspired by corrections arising from a quantum theory of gravity. gravity was first proposed in 1970 by Hans Adolph Buchdahl (although was used rather than for the name of the arbitrary function). It has become an active field of research following work by Starobinsky on cosmic inflation. A wide range of phenomena can be produced from this theory by adopting different functions, ; however, many functional forms can now be ruled out on observational grounds, or because of pathological theoretical problems.

===Other alternatives===
*Kaluza–Klein theory, which posits an extra spatial dimension, thereby making our universe 5D instead of the 4D of General Relativity. The DGP model is one of the models in this category, claimed to be able to explain dark energy without invoking a cosmological constant.
*Entropic gravity, which describes gravity as an entropic force with macro-scale homogeneity but which is subject to quantum-level disorder. The theory claims to be able to remove the need for dark matter, as well as provide a natural explanation for dark energy.
*The GRSI model modifies General Relativity by adding self-interaction terms similar to those in quantum chromodynamics, leading to an effect similar to quark confinement in gravity. It is claimed to be able to explain observations without needing dark matter or dark energy.
*Shockwave cosmology, proposed by Joel Smoller and Blake Temple in 2003, has the “big bang” as an explosion inside a black hole, producing the expanding volume of space and matter that includes the observable universe. This black hole eventually becomes a white hole as the matter density reduces with the expansion. A related theory proposes that the acceleration of the expansion of the observable universe, normally attributed to dark energy, may be caused by an effect of the shockwave.

<text>Piaggio Aerospace, formerly known as Piaggio Aero Industries, is a multinational aerospace manufacturing company headquartered in Villanova d&#x27;Albenga, Italy. The company designs, develops, manufactures and maintains aircraft, aero-engines, aerospace components and aerostructures. The company is a subsidiary of Turkish defence company Baykar.

Established in 1884 as &quot;Rinaldo Piaggio S.p.A.&quot;, it shares its ancestry with motor vehicle manufacturer Piaggio and is one of the world&#x27;s oldest aircraft manufacturers, having produced its first aircraft during 1915. The company&#x27;s facilities were rebuilt following the Second World War and several original designs, including the P.136 seaplane, the P.149 trainer aircraft, and the P.166 utility transport, were released during the first two decades of the postwar era. During the 1960s, Piaggio began manufacturing jet engines as well. During 1966, the business was separated into the aviation-focused &quot;Piaggio Aero&quot; and the motor scooter manufacturer Vespa.

During the 1980s, Piaggio developed a new generation business aircraft, the P.180 Avanti. During the late 1990s, Piaggio underwent drastic changes following its bankruptcy. The company was negatively impacted by the Great Recession and the downturn in the business aircraft market. During late 2018, the company entered into receivership after having declared itself insolvent. The firm owns a subsidiary in the United States, &quot;Piaggio America&quot;, located in West Palm Beach, Florida. In 2021, Piaggio America filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

On 27 December 2024, Baykar, one of Turkey&#x27;s leading defense industry companies, acquired Italy&#x27;s 140-year-old well-established aviation company Piaggio Aerospace. Baykar was the company that submitted the best bid in the tender held to purchase Piaggio Aerospace. Baykar won the tender, which was a contentious process, by leaving behind its competitors who bid from different countries.

==History==
===Under Piaggio ownership and management===

The Rinaldo Piaggio S.p.A company was founded in Sestri Ponente, Genoa, Italy in 1884. Originally, the company was involved in the outfitting of ocean liners and the manufacturing of rolling stock for the developing Italian railway infrastructure around the turn of the century. From the financial gains that it had garnered from these industries, Rinaldo Piaggio was able to construct a large factory based in Finale Marina or Finalmarina during 1906. 
In 1915 the company acquired the Officine Aeronautiche Francesco Oneto and began producing materials for the aeronautical industry.

The 1920s was a particularly turbulent and influential period in the company&#x27;s history; Piaggio Aero brought on two new aeronautical engineers, Giovanni Pegna and Giuseppe Gabrielli, who both played a major role in developing Piaggio&#x27;s aeronautical sector. Penga and Gabrielli worked together to create numerous technical solutions to aviation problems; to support their aerodynamic research, in 1928, Piaggio completed a new wind tunnel.

During 1938, Senator Rinaldo Piaggio died at 71 years old, thus ending the Rinaldo Piaggio era. That same year, the firm finished construction of the new Piaggio P.108 heavy bomber, its first four-engined aircraft.

In 1948, Piaggio launched the Piaggio P.136, a twin-engine seaplane that was operated by the Italian Air Force and various other operators, often in liaison/sea transport capacity. The company also benefited from an increased demand for basic aircraft training; during 1953, the German Air Force ordered 265 Piaggio P.149 trainers. By 1957, Piaggio had also developed the Piaggio P.166, a twin-engine light transport aircraft, which was marketed and produced for military customers and civilian personnel worldwide.

=== The joint venture between Piaggio and Douglas Aircraft Company ===
In 1960, Piaggio secured a production license for the Rolls-Royce Viper turbojet engine; shortly thereafter, the firm began manufacturing jet engines. Four years later, it built its first jet-powered aircraft, the Piaggio PD.808 business aircraft.

=== The separation between the aeronautical and motorcycle divisions ===
In the 1960s, both motorcycle and aeronautical production continued until 1964, the year in which the two divisions were officially split into two separate companies: aeronautical production continued with Armando (and later with Rinaldo, the founder&#x27;s namesake grandson) in the Sestri Ponente plant under the name of Industrie Aeronautiche e Meccaniche Rinaldo Piaggio, while with Enrico Piaggio the Vespa was produced in the Pontedera plant.


=== The success of the P.180 Avanti ===
During the 1980s, Piaggio developed a new generation business aircraft, the P.180 Avanti; 
During 1990, the Avanti received type certification from multiple aviation authorities and entered service shortly thereafter. 
The aircraft was aimed at business and executive clients and its confirmed the fastest turboprops in its category, versatile and exclusive. 

=== The crisis and bankruptcy ===
However, in the 90s, the strong competition in the business aircraft market with business jets, led the company into crisis and subsequently into bankruptcy.
=== Under Turkish holding company Tushav control ===
During the late 1990s, Piaggio&#x27;s ownership went through multiple drastic changes following the firm&#x27;s bankruptcy. During November 1998, it was announced that Turkish holding company Tushav had taken control of Piaggio; it was rebranded as &quot;Piaggio Aero Industries&quot; shortly thereafter. In the years that followed, an increasingly large stake in the company was acquired by a group of entrepreneurs headed by the Josè Di Mase and Piero Ferrari. During 2000, Tushav decided to surrender its interest in Piaggio Aero Industries; the entity had once held a controlling 51% stake in the company, but this hold had reduced in favour of new Italian investors buying into Piaggio.

=== Under Ferrari and Di Mase control and management ===

In 2000 the company was under the control and management of Piero Ferrari and Di Mase and recovered from the crisis of the 90s, with the success of the Avanti and the certification of the Avanti II in 2005. With an order of 36 P.180 Avanti II by Avantair, a New Jersey company, worth almost € 200M, the company emerged from the crisis, becoming a leader in the production of executive aircraft.

During 2006, the Abu Dhabian Mubadala Development Company acquired a 35% stake in Piaggio Aero Industries S.p.A.; Mubadala is a wholly owned investment vehicle of the Government of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates. Two years later, the Indian multinational conglomerate Tata Group acquired a one-third stake in Piaggio Aero Industries, becoming one of the primary shareholders alongside Piero Ferrari, the Di Mase family and the Mubadala Development Company. As part of the acquisition, Tata gained the right to appoint three of the nine seats on the board, and one of the three seats on the management committee.

Starting in 2006, Piaggio was developing a new twin-engined jet, commonly referred to as the Piaggio P1XX; however, during August 2010, the company announced that it had decided to postpone the production phase. This did not represent an absolute termination; for years following the project being put on hold, Piaggio publicly speculated on the possible launch of the programme.

The company was negatively impacted by the Great Recession, the event having caused a downturn in the market for business aircraft; reportedly, deliveries of its P.180 Avanti declined drastically from 30 aircraft during 2008 to only four per year by 2018. Instead of focusing on this declining market, Piaggio decided to orientate itself towards the special missions sector, developing the Piaggio-Selex P.1HH Hammerhead, an unmanned long-endurance intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance derivative of its P.180 Avanti. The platform was also adapted into a maritime patrol aircraft, as well as for additional special purposes, around this same timeframe. In parallel with these programmes, the company continued to make improvements to the base P.180 Avanti, introducing an extended-range model during 2013.
During 2013, Mubadala and Tata injecting an additional €190 million into Piaggio Aero Industries, increasing their combined stakes to 85.5%.

=== Under Mubadala control and management ===
The new Avanti EVO is presented in May 2014.
In October 2014, Piaggio Aero changed its name to Piaggio Aerospace. 
In November 2014, the new Villanova d&#x27;Albenga plant was inaugurated in the presence of the Italian Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, and the Minister of Defense Roberta Pinotti.

During 2015, the Mubadla Development Company acquired 100% of the capital stock, assuming full control of Piaggio, after obtaining the final 1.95% of the stock from Piero Ferrari.

On 3 December 2018, Piaggio Aerospace was admitted into receivership after having declared itself insolvent. 
The company&#x27;s restructuring plan had failed less than a year after its owner, Mubadala, had injected €255 million and repurchased its bank debt. 

=== Under the control of extraordinary commissioners appointed by the Italian government ===

In December 2018, the company entered the extraordinary receivership proceedings with the appointment of Vincenzo Nicastro as Extraordinary Commissioner. The same applied later to its subsidiary Piaggio Aviation. According to two different decrees of the Italian Ministry of Enterprises and Made in Italy signed on 1 March 2023, the Group is now led by three Extraordinary Commissioners: the aforementioned Vincenzo Nicastro, Davide Rossetti (coordinator) and Carmelo Cosentino (industry and aviation expert).

During February 2020, it was announced that Piaggio Aerospace had been put up for sale.

During the extraordinary management by the commissioners, the company is restructured and in 2022 it closes the 2021 financial year with a turnover of approximately 152 million euros, with an order portfolio of around 500 million euros and new orders for a further approximately 180 million euros.

=== Acquired by Baykar ===
In December 2024, the Turkish Baykar Technologies drone manufacturer took over the ownership of Piaggio Aerospace.

==Operations==
===Facilities===
Piaggio Aero Industries has production facilities covering 120,000 square meters (1.3 million square feet) in the northwest Italian cities of Sestri Ponente, Genoa and Finale Ligure, as well as a High Technology Center based in Pozzuoli, near Naples. The final aircraft assembly and flight testing of aircraft is located at main facility in Genoa, which includes the corporate headquarters. Also located here is the Company&#x27;s new JAR 145 certified service center, which offers full service and support to Piaggio P.180 Avanti customers as well as other aircraft. Piaggio Aero also operates two additional service centers, one at Rome&#x27;s Ciampino Airport and the other at the Pratica di Mare Air Base.

Aircraft and engine component manufacturing operations, general engineering, and engine maintenance and overhaul are all undertaken at Finale Ligure. Operations include a maintenance center and two production areas, one for engines and sheet metal parts, another for major aircraft sub-assemblies and aero structures. The High Technology Center is located in the Campania region of Italy, near Naples, focuses on aero structure design and systems research. It includes the Piaggio High Technology (PHT) division, a corporate research facility which focuses on aeronautical technologies. The PHT division is a joint partnership between Piaggio Aero Industries, the Italian Aerospace Research Centre (CIRA), and other European research centers.

During the 2010s, Piaggio Aero constructed a new modern manufacturing facility in Villanova d&#x27;Albenga, about 70 kilometers west of Genoa. Designed around the principles of lean manufacturing technologies, this plant enabled increases in production efficiency via an optimised workflow, as well as production capacity.

===Aero engines===
A major portion of Piaggio&#x27;s work has been in the aero engines sector; the company has claimed to be the only aircraft manufacturer that also builds and maintains aero engines. It has been involved in component manufacture, as well as maintenance, repair and overhaul operations on jet, turboshaft and turboprop engines, from various international major manufacturers, including Rolls-Royce and Honeywell.

<text>Tropicbirds are a family, Phaethontidae, of tropical pelagic seabirds. They are the sole living representatives of the order Phaethontiformes. For many years they were considered part of the Pelecaniformes, but genetics indicates they are most closely related to the Eurypygiformes. There are three species in one genus, Phaethon. The scientific names are derived from Ancient Greek &quot;phaethon&quot;, &quot;sun&quot;. They have predominantly white plumage with elongated tail feathers and small feeble legs and feet.

==Taxonomy, systematics and evolution==
The genus &quot;Phaethon&quot; was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The name is from Ancient Greek &quot;phaethōn&quot; meaning &quot;sun&quot;. The type species was designated as the red-billed tropicbird (&quot;Phaethon aethereus&quot;) by George Robert Gray in 1840.

Tropicbirds were traditionally grouped in the order Pelecaniformes, which contained the pelicans, cormorants and shags, darters, gannets and boobies and frigatebirds; in the Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy, the Pelecaniformes were united with other groups into a large &quot;Ciconiiformes&quot;. More recently this grouping has been found to be massively paraphyletic (missing closer relatives of its distantly related groups) and split again.

Microscopic analysis of eggshell structure by Konstantin Mikhailov in 1995 found that the eggshells of tropicbirds lacked the covering of thick microglobular material of other Pelecaniformes. Jarvis, &quot;et al&quot;.&#x27;s 2014 paper &quot;Whole-genome analyses resolve early branches in the tree of life of modern birds&quot; aligns the tropicbirds most closely with the sunbittern and the kagu of the Eurypygiformes, with these two clades forming the sister group of the &quot;core water birds&quot;, the Aequornithes, and the Metaves hypothesis abandoned.

*** White-tailed tropicbird, &quot;P. lepturus&quot; (widespread in tropical waters, except in the eastern Pacific)

The red-billed tropicbird is basal within the genus. The split between the red-billed tropicbird and the other two tropicbirds is hypothesized to have taken place about six million years ago, with the split between the red-tailed and white-tailed tropicbird taking place about four million years ago.

&quot;Phaethusavis&quot; and &quot;Heliadornis&quot; are prehistoric genera of tropicbirds described from fossils.

===Extant species===



==Description==

Tropicbirds range in size from 76 cm to 102 cm in length and 94 cm to 112 cm in wingspan. Their plumage is predominantly white, with elongated central tail feathers. The three species have different combinations of black markings on the face, back, and wings. Their bills are large, powerful and slightly decurved. Their heads are large and their necks are short and thick. They have totipalmate feet (that is, all four toes are connected by a web). The legs of a tropicbird are located far back on their body, making walking impossible, so that they can only move on land by pushing themselves forward with their feet.

The tropicbirds&#x27; call is typically a loud, piercing, shrill, but grating whistle, or crackle. These are often given in a rapid series when they are in a display flight at the colony. In old literature they were referred to as boatswain (bo&#x27;sun&#x27;/bosun) birds due their loud whistling calls.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Tropicbirds frequently catch their prey by hovering and then plunge-diving, typically only into the surface-layer of the waters. They eat mostly fish, especially flying fish, and occasionally squid. Tropicbirds tend to avoid multi-species feeding flocks, unlike the frigatebirds, which have similar diets.
Tropicbirds are usually solitary or in pairs away from breeding colonies. There they engage in spectacular courtship displays. For several minutes, groups of 2–20 birds simultaneously and repeatedly fly around one another in large, vertical circles, while swinging the tail streamers from side to side. If the female likes the presentation, she will mate with the male in his prospective nest-site. Occasionally, disputes will occur between males trying to protect their mates and nesting areas.

Tropicbirds generally nest in holes or crevices on the bare ground. The female lays one white egg, spotted brown, and incubates for 40–46 days. The incubation is performed by both parents, but mostly the female, while the male brings food to feed the female. The chick hatches with grey down. It will stay alone in the nest while both parents search for food, and they will feed the chick twice every three days until fledging, about 12–13 weeks after hatching. The young are not able to fly initially; they will float on the ocean for several days to lose weight before flight.

Tropicbird chicks have slower growth than nearshore birds, and they tend to accumulate fat deposits while young. That, along with one-egg clutches, appears to be an adaptation to a pelagic lifestyle where food is often gathered in large amounts, but may be hard to find.

<doc id="208673" wikidata="Q151494" url="?curid=208673" title="Mehmed V">
<text>Mehmed V Reşâd (; or ; 2 November 1844 – 3 July 1918) was the penultimate sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1909 to 1918. Mehmed V reigned as a constitutional monarch. He had little influence over government affairs and the Ottoman constitution was held with little regard by his ministries. The first half of his reign was marked by contentious politicking between factions of the Young Turks, and the second half by war and domination of the Committee of Union and Progress and the Three Pashas.

Reşad was the son of Sultan Abdulmejid I. He succeeded his half-brother Abdul Hamid II after the 31 March Incident. Coming to power in the aftermath of the failed coup attempt, his nine-year reign featured three coups d&#x27;etat, four wars, eleven governments, and numerous uprisings. The Italo-Turkish War saw the cession of the Empire&#x27;s North African territories and the Dodecanese Islands, including Rhodes, during which the CUP was forced out of power by the military. This was followed up by the traumatic loss of almost all of the Empire&#x27;s European territories west of Constantinople (now Istanbul) in the First Balkan War, and the return of a now radicalized CUP rule in another coup. Eastern Thrace was retaken in the Second Balkan War.

The Ottomans entered World War I in November 1914, upon which Mehmed declared a jihad against the Allies. In 1915, Ottoman forces successfully fended off an Allied invasion at Gallipoli and captured a large British garrison at Kut. During that year, the CUP initiated the Armenian genocide against the Sultan&#x27;s wishes, though his private disapproval over his governments&#x27; actions was inconsequential. By Mehmed V&#x27;s death on 3 July 1918, defeat loomed on the Macedonian, Palestinian, and Western fronts. With military collapse in the field and the Arab Revolt spelling impending disaster, the Ottomans signed the Armistice of Mudros, though by then he was dead, and succeeded by Mehmed VI.

== Early life ==
Prince Mehmed Reşad was born on 2 November 1844, at the Çırağan Palace, Constantinople. His father was Sultan Abdulmejid I, and his mother was Gülcemal Kadın. He had three elder sisters, Fatma Sultan, Refia Sultan and Hatice Sultan (Refia Sultan&#x27;s twin sister, died in infancy). After his mother&#x27;s death in 1851, he and his sisters were entrusted to the care of his father&#x27;s senior consort Servetseza Kadın. She had asked Abdulmejid to take the motherless children under her wing, and raised as her own, and carried out the duties of a mother who cares for her children with compassion and concern.

In 1856, aged twelve, he was ceremoniously circumcised together with his younger half-brothers, Şehzade Ahmed Kemaleddin, Şehzade Mehmed Burhaneddin, and Şehzade Ahmed Nureddin.

Reşad received his education at the palace. Halid Ziya, the chief clerk of the Chamberlain&#x27;s office between 1909 and 1912, described this as being a poor one. Thanks to his comparatively high intelligence, however, he made good use of the education he had. He studied Arabic and Persian, and spoke the latter very well. He took piano lessons from an Italian pianist and calligraphy lessons from a famous Ottoman calligrapher, Kazasker Mustafa Izzet Efendi (1801–1876), who designed the giant pendant medallions of the Hagia Sophia. In addition to Persian literature, Mehmed was also interested in Mevlevi Sufism and the &quot;Masnavi&quot;.

He enjoyed the company of his uncle Abdul Aziz. Mehmed became crown-prince in 1876 with the ascension of his brother Abdul Hamid II, but was essentially kept under house arrest in Dolmabahçe Palace, and was under close surveillance. Abdul Hamid made sure to not personally communicate with him.

After the lifting of many restrictions in the aftermath of the Young Turk Revolution Mehmed earned popularity as crown prince by attending ceremonies that celebrated the constitution, much to the chagrin of his previously absolutist brother.

== Reign ==
His reign began at the conclusion of the 31 March Incident on 27 April 1909, which resulted in the deposition of his brother Abdul Hamid II. Mehmed came to the throne largely as a figurehead with no real political power. At the age of 64, Mehmed V was the oldest person to ascend the Turkish throne. It was decided to use the name &quot;Mehmed&quot; as his regal name, not his real name &quot;Reşad&quot;. This name change was made upon the suggestion of Ferik Sami Pasha, to establish a connection between Mehmed the Conqueror&#x27;s entry into Constantinople with his army and the arrival of the Action Army to Istanbul. Although he ascended to the throne with the title of Mehmed V, he was called Sultan Reşad by the people.

=== Enthronement and sword girding ===
His ceremony was held in the Ministry of War building (now part of Istanbul University) in Beyazıt. The new sultan boarded the &quot;İhsaniye&quot; from Dolmabahçe Palace to Sirkeci, during which he received a gun salute that frightened him. As he was leaving Sirkeci to Beyazıt in the royal carriage, the people of Istanbul lined up on both sides of the road and enthusiastically applauded as he passed by. In his speech after the bay&#x27;ah prayer, he declared, &quot;I am the first sultan of liberty and I am proud of it!&quot; and from then on Mehmed V was known as the &quot;Constitutional Sultan.&quot; On May 10, 1909, the sultan boarded the yacht &quot;Söğütlü&quot; in front of Dolmabahçe and went to Eyüp. He was girded with the sword of Osman in the Eyüp Mausoleum by the Shaykh al-Islam Saygı Efendi and Postnişini Abdülhalim Efendi of the Mevlevi Order. Mehmed V then boarded the royal carriage and visited the tomb of Mehmed the Conqueror in the Fatih Mosque, after which he returned to the Dolmabahçe. Since the sultan was not seen on the streets of Istanbul during the long years of Abdul Hamid&#x27;s reign, the new sultan&#x27;s carriage trip around the city, during which he cheerfully greeted his subjects, created great excitement among the people of Istanbul.

=== First years ===

Because of his house imprisonment, Mehmed sat on the throne at the age of 65 and with no experience in state affairs. Due to his meek and weak-willed personality and the strength of the Young Turk movement, the government was firmly out of his hands. When the sultan was asked to take a more proactive approach to politics when partisanship took hold, Mehmed V responded &quot;If I was to interfere in every matter during the Constitutional Monarchy administration, what was [my] brother&#x27;s fault?&quot; He also claimed that he had to be subservient to the Unionists in order to save the sultanate, otherwise the Unionists would have declared a republic.

Despite its shaky foundations, the constitution was promulgated for the third and final time when Mehmed ascended to the throne (it was retracted during the 1909 and 1878 crisis). However the issue about what to with the 31 March perpetrators revealed who was really in power: Mahmud Şevket Pasha and the Committee of Union and Progress. In the immediate aftermath of the 31 March Incident, Mehmed V persistently informed the members of the Chamber of Deputies that he would not approve the executions of common criminals and especially political criminals associated with the 31 March uprising. Afterwards, he wasn&#x27;t able to resist the insistence of the Unionist politicians, and eventually approved their hanging. This was the first of many examples of Sultan Reşad&#x27;s reluctant approval of many laws, decrees and wills during his reign against his personal convictions and the constitution, and he soon developed a disinterest in statecraft.

On May 5, 1909, Ahmed Tevfik Pasha, Abdul Hamid II&#x27;s last grand vizier who was appointed in the middle of the 31 March Crisis, resigned under the pressure from the CUP, and a new government more favorable to the committee was formed under the grand viziership of Hüseyin Hilmi Pasha.

The Albanian Revolt of 1910 broke out and was suppressed by Şevket Pasha, now War Minister. The assassination of Ahmet Samim Bey and the Western-sponsored integration of the Cretan State into Greece threw the sultan into a fit of depression.

In June 1911, he embarked on an imperial tour of Selânik (Salonica, today Thessaloniki) and Manastır (today Bitola), stopping by Florina on the way. He also visited Üsküp (Skopje) and Priştine (Pristina), where he attended Friday prayers at the Tomb of Sultan Murad. The visit was recorded on film and photographs by the Manaki brothers. It would soon prove to be the last visit of an Ottoman sultan to the Rumelian provinces before the catastrophe of the Balkan Wars the following year.

In the backdrop of the 1912 Albanian revolt and the Italian invasion of Libya, due to the CUP&#x27;s policies of centralization and Turkish nationalism, the 1912 elections were mainly a contest between the CUP and the new Freedom and Accord Party. With the CUP rigging the proceedings to their advantage, the military decided to dispute the results. The Savior Officers demanded the pro-CUP Grand Vizier Mehmed Said Pasha dissolve parliament and to resign, which he did. Mehmed V appointed Ahmed Muhtar Pasha in his place, who formed a national unity government called the Great Cabinet. Martial law was declared. With defeat in the Balkan Wars, Muhtar Pasha resigned, and was replaced by Kâmil Pasha.

=== War ===
Under his rule, the Ottoman Empire lost all its remaining territory in North Africa (Tripolitania, Cyrenaica and Fezzan) and the Dodecanese to Italy in the Italo-Turkish War and nearly all its European territories (except for a small strip of land west of Constantinople) in the First Balkan War. The Ottomans made some small gains in the following war, recapturing the peninsula comprising East Thrace up to Edirne, but this was only partial consolation for the Turks: the bulk of Ottoman territories that they had fought to keep had been lost forever.

The sudden loss of these enormous swaths of land, which had been Ottoman territory for centuries and were ceded to the Empire&#x27;s opponents within a span of only two years, was traumatic to the Turks and culminated in the 1913 Ottoman coup d&#x27;etat. Muslims in the lost lands were expelled from their homes and emigrated behind the new Ottoman border surrounding Constantinople. The resulting refugee crisis overwhelmed municipal authorities. It also spelt the end of the Ottomanism movement, which for several decades had advocated equal rights to all citizens of the Empire regardless of ethnicity or religion, in order to foster a communal sense of belonging and allegiance to the Ottoman state. With the loss of the Empire&#x27;s ethnic minorities in Rumelia and North Africa, the movement&#x27;s &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; also evaporated, and the country&#x27;s politics soon began to take on a more exclusionary character, centered around Turkish nationalism. The more extreme elements of a right-wing faction, primarily in the upper echelons of the CUP-dominated government, would go on to commit genocide against the Armenians.

Despite his preference that the country stayed out of further conflict, Mehmed V&#x27;s most significant political act was to formally declare jihad against the Entente Powers on 14 November 1914, following the Ottoman government&#x27;s decision to join the First World War on the side of the Central Powers. He was actually said to look with disfavour on the pro-German policy of Enver Pasha, but could do little to prevent war due to the sultanate&#x27;s diminished influence.

This was the last genuine proclamation of jihad in history by a Caliph, as the Caliphate was abolished in 1924. As a direct result of the declaration of war, the British annexed Cyprus, while the Khedivate of Egypt proclaimed its independence and was turned into a British protectorate; these provinces had at least been under nominal Ottoman rule. The proclamation had no noticeable effect on the war, despite the fact that many Muslims lived in Ottoman territories. Some Arabs eventually joined the British forces against the Ottoman Empire with the Arab Revolt in 1916.

Mehmed V hosted Kaiser Wilhelm II, his World War I ally, in Constantinople on 15 October 1917. He was made &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; of the Kingdom of Prussia on 27 January 1916, and of the German Empire on 1 February 1916. He was also made a &quot;Feldmarschall&quot; of Austria-Hungary on 19 May 1918.

== Death ==
Mehmed V died at Yıldız Palace on 3 July 1918 at the age of 73, only four months before the end of World War I. Thus, he did not live to see the downfall of the Ottoman Empire. He spent most of his life at the Dolmabahçe Palace and Yıldız Palace in Constantinople. His grave is in the Eyüp district of modern Istanbul. He was succeeded by his brother Mehmed Vahideddin, who took the regal name Mehmed VI.

<text>The Bell X-1 (Bell Model 44) is a rocket engine–powered aircraft, designated originally as the XS-1, and was a joint National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics–U.S. Army Air Forces–U.S. Air Force supersonic research project built by Bell Aircraft. Conceived during 1944 and designed and built in 1945, it achieved a speed of nearly in 1948. A derivative of this same design, the Bell X-1A, having greater fuel capacity and hence longer rocket burning time, exceeded in 1954. The X-1 aircraft #46-062, nicknamed &quot;Glamorous Glennis&quot; and flown by Chuck Yeager, was the first piloted airplane to exceed the speed of sound in level flight and was the first of the X-planes, a series of American experimental rocket planes (and non-rocket planes) designed for testing new technologies.

==Design and development==
===Parallel development===

In 1942, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Ministry of Aviation began a top secret project with Miles Aircraft to develop the world&#x27;s first aircraft capable of breaking the sound barrier. The project resulted in the design of the turbojet-powered Miles M.52, with a maximum speed of (over twice the existing airspeed record) in level flight, and able to climb to an altitude of 36,000 ft (11 km) in 1 min and 30 sec. The fuselage was shaped like a bullet, it had thin wings and a slab tailplane for controlled flight at the speed of sound and beyond. Miles&#x27; chief aerodynamicist, Dennis Bancroft, was interviewed many years later in 1997 on his reason for needing an all-moving tailplane in his 1944 design.
:::DENNIS BANCROFT: We thought the ordinary controls wouldn&#x27;t work above the speed of sound. So, we had to make an all-moving tail plane, because an ordinary elevator would literally not function at all. We would go up to the speed of sound, lose all air control, and the aircraft would crash.

In 1944 Miles was told to go ahead with the construction of three prototypes. In February 1946, with a first flight expected in the summer of 1946, the M52 was cancelled. In place of the manned full-scale M.52 it was decided to test 3/10 scale models of the aircraft, rocket propelled, dropped from an aircraft, and controlled by an autopilot. On the 10th of October 1948 a model achieved Mach 1.38 in level flight.
:::STACY KEACH (NARRATOR): One year after the X-1&#x27;s historic flight, Britain broke the sound barrier with a one-third scale model of the M-52. Although unmanned and radio-controlled, it did finally vindicate the worthiness of its supersonic design.

The Bell XS-1 would have a conventional horizontal tail-plane but with trimming available on the stabilizer. It would be required for pitch control when a shockwave was preventing a deflected elevator from altering the pressure distribution and pitching force on the tailplane.

In September 1946 a DH 108 tail-less jet aircraft was practicing for an attempt on the world speed record when it experienced violent pitching oscillations at Mach 0.875 and broke up. The Bell XS-1 would have a conventional horizontal tail which provides pitch damping not present in a tail-less aircraft.

===Research studies===

The XS-1 was first discussed in December 1944. Early specifications for the aircraft were for a piloted supersonic vehicle that could fly at at for two to five minutes. On 16 March 1945, the U.S. Army Air Forces Flight Test Division and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) contracted with the Bell Aircraft Company to build three XS-1 (for &quot;Experimental, Supersonic&quot;, later X-1) aircraft to obtain flight data on conditions in the transonic speed range.

Bell built a rocket plane after considering the turbojet alternative. Turbojets could not achieve the required performance at high altitude. An aircraft with both turbojet and rocket engines would be too large and complex. The X-1 was, in principle, a &quot;bullet with wings&quot;, its shape closely resembling a Browning .50-caliber (12.7 mm) machine gun bullet, known to be stable in supersonic flight. The shape was followed to the extent of seating its pilot behind a sloped, framed window inside a confined cockpit in the nose, with no ejection seat.

For the design of the XS-1 the many unknowns relating to transonic and supersonic flight meant seeking every available source of information from governmental agencies, powerplant manufacturers and research institutions. Foreign information became available in early 1946, shortly after the first glide test of the XS-1 in Jan 1946, when the British Ministry of Supply cancelled the Miles M.52 and ordered all research reports and other information be sent to Bell Aircraft.

Bell Aircraft aerodynamicists working with NACA laboratories predicted significant longitudinal trim changes during transonic flight. John Stack and Robert Gilruth at NACA recommended that Bell mount the elevator on an adjustable horizontal stabilizer. Bell incorporated the stabilizer with rapid adjustment in pitch to accommodate large changes of trim. A contractor test flight by Tex Johnston showed an unacceptable lost motion between the pilot&#x27;s input to the horizontal stabilizer and the stabilizer actuator which was corrected before the XS-1 was handed over for the high speed research program. The whole tailplane could be moved or just the elevator at fixed stabilizer settings. It was placed as high as possible above the wing wake with a thinner section than for the wing to separate the high drag rise from the wing from compressibility effects on the tail. Initially, as increases in speed were made in small steps towards possibly unknown control difficulties the horizontal stabilizer was left at its pre-launch angle set on the ground as there was concern that adjusting it at high speed would cause severe control problems. Nevertheless, in October 1947, when test pilot Yeager ran out of elevator authority (no pitch control) at Mach 0.94 it took the test team by surprise until they realized that extra control was available by moving the horizontal stabilizer. The tailplane trim setting had to be accurately set on the ground to ensure a controlled drop at the beginning of a flight. Scott Crossfield relates an inadvertent one-degree error flipping the X-1 on its back after being dropped from the mother plane. The tailplane configuration was carried over to the X-1A series. All subsequent supersonic aircraft would either have an all-moving tailplane or be &quot;tailless&quot; delta winged types.

Swept wings were not used because too little was known about them. As the design might lead to a fighter, the XS-1 was intended to take off from the ground, but the end of the war made the B-29 Superfortress available to carry it into the air. 

The rocket engine was a four-chamber design built by Reaction Motors Inc., one of the first companies to build liquid-propellant rocket engines in the U.S. After considering hydrogen peroxide monopropellant, aniline/nitric acid bipropellant, and nitromethane monopropellant as fuels, the rocket burned ethyl alcohol diluted with water with a liquid oxygen oxidizer. Its four chambers could be individually turned on and off, so thrust could be changed in increments. The fuel and oxygen tanks for the first two X-1 engines were pressurized with nitrogen, reducing flight time by about minutes and increasing landing weight by , but the rest used gas-driven turbopumps, increasing the chamber pressure and thrust while making the engine lighter.

==Operational history==
Bell Aircraft chief test pilot Jack Woolams became the first person to fly the XS-1. He made a glide-flight over Pinecastle Army Airfield, in Florida, on 19 January 1946. Woolams completed nine more glide-flights over Pinecastle, with the B-29 dropping the aircraft at and the XS-1 landing 12 minutes later at about . In March 1946 the #1 rocket plane was returned to Bell Aircraft in Buffalo, New York for modifications to prepare for the powered flight tests. Four more glide tests occurred at Muroc Army Air Field near Palmdale, California, which had been flooded during the Florida tests, before the first powered test on 9 December 1946. Two chambers were ignited, but the aircraft accelerated so quickly that one chamber was turned off until reignition at , reaching Mach 0.795. After the chambers were turned off the aircraft descended to , where all four chambers were briefly tested.

After Woolams died while practicing for the National Air Races in August 1946, Chalmers &quot;Slick&quot; Goodlin was assigned as the primary Bell Aircraft test pilot for the X-1. Goodlin made the first powered flight on 9 December 1946. Tex Johnston, Bell&#x27;s chief test pilot and program supervisor, made a test flight on 22 May 1947, after complaints about the slow progress of flight tests. According to Johnston, &quot;The contract with the Air Corps defined the tests by Bell as onboard systems verification, handling characteristics evaluation, stability and control, and performance testing to Mach 0.99.&quot; After Johnston&#x27;s initial flight at 0.72 Mach, he thought the airplane was ready for supersonic flights, after the longitudinal trim system was fixed, and three more test flights.

The Army Air Force was unhappy with the cautious pace of flight envelope expansion and Bell Aircraft&#x27;s flight test contract for airplane #46-062 was terminated. The test program was acquired by the Army Air Force Flight Test Division on 24 June after months of negotiation. Goodlin had demanded a US$150,000 bonus (equivalent to $ million in ) for exceeding the speed of sound. Flight tests of the X-1-2 (serial 46-063) would be conducted by NACA to provide design data for later production high-performance aircraft.

===Mach 1 flight===

The first manned supersonic flight occurred on 14 October 1947, over the Mojave Desert in California, less than a month after the U.S. Air Force had been created as a separate service. Captain Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Yeager piloted USAF aircraft #46-062, nicknamed &quot;Glamorous Glennis&quot; for his wife. The airplane was drop launched from the bomb bay of a B-29 and reached Mach 1.06 (). Following burnout of the engine, the plane glided to a landing on the dry lake bed. This was XS-1 flight number 50.

The three main participants in the X-1 program won the National Aeronautics Association Collier Trophy in 1948 for their efforts. Honored at the White House by President Truman were Larry Bell for Bell Aircraft, Captain Yeager for piloting the flights, and John Stack for the contributions of the NACA.

The story of Yeager&#x27;s 14 October flight was leaked to a reporter from the magazine &quot;Aviation Week&quot;, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; featured the story as headline news in their 22 December issue. The magazine story was released on 20 December. The Air Force threatened legal action against the journalists who revealed the story, but none ever occurred. The news of a straight-wing supersonic aircraft surprised many American experts, who like their German counterparts during the war believed that a swept-wing design was necessary to break the sound barrier. On 10 June 1948, Air Force Secretary Stuart Symington announced that the sound barrier had been repeatedly broken by two experimental airplanes.

On 5 January 1949, Yeager used Aircraft #46-062 to perform the only conventional (runway) launch of the X-1 program, attaining in 90 seconds.

===Legacy===
In 1997, the United States Postal Service issued a fiftieth anniversary commemorative stamp recognizing the Bell X1-6062 aircraft as the first aeronautical vehicle to fly at supersonic speed of approximately .

The Bell X-1 is also the subject of a toy version in the &quot;Arthur&quot; episode &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Big Hit&quot;. In that episode, Arthur&#x27;s sister D.W. tries to let it fly out the window, but it ends up falling to the ground and breaking. This resulted in a classic moment in which Arthur clenches his fist and punches D.W.; this moment has since become a popular meme.

==Variants==
Later variants of the X-1 were built to test different aspects of supersonic flight; one of these, the X-1A, with Yeager at the controls, inadvertently demonstrated a very dangerous characteristic of fast (Mach 2 plus) supersonic flight: inertia coupling. Only Yeager&#x27;s skills as an aviator prevented disaster; later Mel Apt would lose his life testing the Bell X-2 under similar circumstances.

===X-1A===
(Bell Model 58A)

Ordered by the Air Force on 2 April 1948, the X-1A (serial number 48-1384) was intended to investigate aerodynamic phenomena at speeds greater than Mach 2 (681 m/s, 2,451 km/h) and altitudes greater than 90,000 ft (27 km), specifically emphasizing dynamic stability and air loads. Longer and heavier than the original X-1, with a stepped canopy for better vision, the X-1A was powered by the same Reaction Motors XLR-11 rocket engine. The aircraft first flew, unpowered, on 14 February 1953 at Edwards AFB, with the first powered flight on 21 February. Both flights were piloted by Bell test pilot Jean &quot;Skip&quot; Ziegler.

After NACA started its high-speed testing with the Douglas Skyrocket, culminating in Scott Crossfield achieving Mach 2.005 on 20 November 1953, the Air Force started a series of tests with the X-1A, which the test pilot of the series, Chuck Yeager, named &quot;Operation NACA Weep&quot;. These culminated on 12 December 1953, when Yeager achieved an altitude of and a new airspeed record of Mach 2.44 (equal to 1620 mph, 724.5 m/s, 2608 km/h at that altitude). Unlike Crossfield in the Skyrocket, Yeager achieved that in level flight. Soon afterwards, the aircraft spun out of control, due to the then not yet understood phenomenon of inertia coupling. The X-1A dropped from maximum altitude to , exposing the pilot to accelerations of as much as 8g, during which Yeager broke the canopy with his helmet before regaining control.

On 28 May 1954, Maj. Arthur W. Murray piloted the X-1A to a new record of .

The aircraft was transferred to NACA during September 1954, and subsequently modified. The X-1A was lost on 8 August 1955, when, while being prepared for launch from the RB-50 mothership, an explosion ruptured the plane&#x27;s liquid oxygen tank. With the help of crewmembers on the RB-50, test pilot Joseph A. Walker successfully extricated himself from the plane, which was then jettisoned. Exploding on impact with the desert floor, the X-1A became the first of many early X-planes that would be lost to explosions.

===X-1B===
(Bell Model 58B)

The X-1B (serial 48-1385) was equipped with aerodynamic heating instrumentation for thermal research (more than 300 thermal probes were installed on its surface). It was similar to the X-1A except for having a slightly different wing. The X-1B was used for high-speed research by the U.S. Air Force starting from October 1954, prior to being transferred to the NACA during January 1955. NACA continued to fly the aircraft until January 1958, when cracks in the fuel tanks forced its grounding. The X-1B completed a total of 27 flights. A notable achievement was the installation of a system of small reaction rockets used for directional control, making the X-1B the first aircraft to fly with this sophisticated control system, later used in the North American X-15. The X-1B is now at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base at Dayton, Ohio, where it is displayed in the museum&#x27;s Maj. Gen. Albert Boyd and Maj. Gen. Fred Ascani Research and Development Gallery.

===X-1C===
(Bell Model 58C)
The X-1C (serial 48-1387) was intended to test armaments and munitions in the high transonic and supersonic flight regimes. It was canceled while still in the mockup stage, as the development of transonic and supersonic-capable aircraft like the North American F-86 Sabre and the North American F-100 Super Sabre eliminated the need for a dedicated experimental test vehicle.

===X-1D===
(Bell Model 58D)
The X-1D (serial 48-1386) was the first of the second generation of supersonic rocket planes. Flown from an EB-50A (s/n #46-006), it was to be used for heat transfer research. The X-1D was equipped with a new low-pressure fuel system and a slightly increased fuel capacity. There were also some minor changes of the avionics suite.

On 24 July 1951, with Bell test pilot Jean &quot;Skip&quot; Ziegler at the controls, the X-1D was launched over Rogers Dry Lake, on what was to become the only successful flight of its career. The unpowered glide was completed after a nine-minute descent, but upon landing, the nose landing gear failed and the aircraft slid ungracefully to a stop. Repairs took several weeks to complete and a second flight was scheduled for mid-August. On 22 August 1951, the X-1D was lost in a fuel explosion during preparations for the first powered flight. The aircraft was destroyed upon impact after it was jettisoned from its EB-50A mothership.

===X-1E===
(Bell Model 44)

The X-1E was the result of a reconstruction of the X-1-2 (serial 46-063), in order to pursue the goals originally set for the X-1D and X-1-3 (serial 46-064), both lost by explosions during 1951. The cause of the mysterious explosions was finally traced to the use of Ulmer leather gaskets impregnated with tricresyl phosphate (TCP), a leather treatment, which was used in the liquid oxygen plumbing. TCP becomes unstable and explosive in the presence of pure oxygen and mechanical shock. This mistake cost two lives, caused injuries and lost several aircraft.
The changes included:

* A turbopump fuel feed system, which eliminated the high-pressure nitrogen fuel system used in &#x27;062 and &#x27;063. Concerns about metal fatigue in the nitrogen fuel system resulted in the grounding of the X-1-2 after its 54th flight in its original configuration.
* A re-profiled super-thin wing ( at the root), based on the X-3 Stiletto wing profile, enabling the X-1E to exceed Mach 2.
* A &#x27;knife-edge&#x27; windscreen replaced the original greenhouse glazing, an upward-opening canopy replaced the fuselage side hatch and allowed the inclusion of an ejection seat.
* The addition of 200 pressure ports for aerodynamic data, and 343 strain gauges to measure structural loads and aerodynamic heating along the wing and fuselage.

The X-1E first flew on 15 December 1955, a glide-flight controlled by USAF test pilot Joe Walker. Walker left the X-1E program during 1958, after 21 flights, attaining a maximum speed of Mach 2.21 (752 m/s, 2,704 km/h). NACA research pilot John B. McKay took his place during September 1958, completing five flights in pursuit of Mach 3 (1,021 m/s, 3,675 km/h) before the X-1E was permanently grounded after its 26th flight, during November 1958, due to the discovery of structural cracks in the fuel tank wall.

==Aircraft on display==
* X-1-1, Air Force Serial Number 46-062 &quot;Glamorous Glennis&quot;, is currently displayed in the Boeing Aviation Hangar of the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Dulles, where it was moved during renovations to the National Air and Space Museum. The aircraft was flown to Washington, D.C., beneath a B-29 and presented to what was then the American National Air Museum in 1950.
* X-1B, AF Ser. No. 48-1385, is on display in the Research &amp; Development Hangar at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

<text>In linguistics, a verb phrase (VP) is a syntactic unit composed of a verb and its arguments except the subject of an independent clause or coordinate clause. Thus, in the sentence &quot;A fat man quickly put the money into the box&quot;, the words &quot;quickly put the money into the box&quot; constitute a verb phrase; it consists of the verb &quot;put&quot; and its arguments, but not the subject &quot;a fat man&quot;. A verb phrase is similar to what is considered a &quot;predicate&quot; in traditional grammars.

Verb phrases generally are divided among two types: finite, of which the head of the phrase is a finite verb; and nonfinite, where the head is a nonfinite verb, such as an infinitive, participle or gerund. Phrase structure grammars acknowledge both types, but dependency grammars treat the subject as just another verbal dependent, and they do not recognize the finite verbal phrase constituent. Understanding verb phrase analysis depends on knowing which theory applies in context.

==In phrase structure grammars==
In phrase structure grammars such as generative grammar, the verb phrase is one headed by a verb. It may be composed of only a single verb, but typically it consists of combinations of main and auxiliary verbs, plus optional specifiers, complements (not including subject complements), and adjuncts. For example:

:Yankee batters hit the ball well enough to win their first World Series since 2000.
:Mary saw the man through the window.
:David gave Mary a book.

The first example contains the long verb phrase &quot;hit the ball well enough to win their first World Series since 2000&quot;; the second is a verb phrase composed of the main verb &quot;saw&quot;, the complement phrase &quot;the man&quot; (a noun phrase), and the adjunct phrase &quot;through the window&quot; (an adverbial phrase and prepositional phrase). The third example presents three elements, the main verb &quot;gave&quot;, the noun &quot;Mary&quot;, and the noun phrase &quot;a book&quot;, all of which comprise the verb phrase. Note, the verb phrase described here corresponds to the predicate of traditional grammar.

Current views vary on whether all languages have a verb phrase; some schools of generative grammar (such as principles and parameters) hold that all languages have a verb phrase, while others (such as lexical functional grammar) take the view that at least some languages lack a verb phrase constituent, including those languages with a very free word order (the so-called non-configurational languages, such as Japanese, Hungarian, or Australian aboriginal languages), and some languages with a default VSO order (several Celtic and Oceanic languages).

Phrase structure grammars view both finite and nonfinite verb phrases as constituent phrases and, consequently, do not draw any key distinction between them. Dependency grammars (described below) are much different in this regard.

==In dependency grammars==
While phrase structure grammars (constituency grammars) acknowledge both finite and non-finite VPs as constituents (complete subtrees), dependency grammars reject the former. That is, dependency grammars acknowledge only non-finite VPs as constituents; finite VPs do not qualify as constituents in dependency grammars. For example:

::John has finished the work. 
::John has finished the work. 

Since &quot;has finished the work&quot; contains the finite verb &quot;has&quot;, it is a finite VP, and since &quot;finished the work&quot; contains the non-finite verb &quot;finished&quot; but lacks a finite verb, it is a non-finite VP. Similar examples:

::They do not want to try that. 
::They do not want to try that. 
::They do not want to try that. 

These examples illustrate well that many clauses can contain more than one non-finite VP, but they generally contain only one finite VP. Starting with Lucien Tesnière 1959, dependency grammars challenge the validity of the initial binary division of the clause into subject (NP) and predicate (VP), which means they reject the notion that the second half of this binary division, i.e. the finite VP, is a constituent. They do, however, readily acknowledge the existence of non-finite VPs as constituents. The two competing views of verb phrases are visible in the following trees:

The constituency tree on the left shows the finite VP &quot;has finished the work&quot; as a constituent, since it corresponds to a complete subtree. The dependency tree on the right, in contrast, does not acknowledge a finite VP constituent, since there is no complete subtree there that corresponds to &quot;has finished the work&quot;. Note that the analyses agree concerning the non-finite VP &quot;finished the work&quot;; both see it as a constituent (complete subtree).

Dependency grammars point to the results of many standard constituency tests to back up their stance. For instance, topicalization, pseudoclefting, and answer ellipsis suggest that non-finite VP does, but finite VP does not, exist as a constituent:

:: *...and has finished the work, John. 
:: *What John has done is has finished the work. 
:: What has John done? – *Has finished the work. 

The * indicates that the sentence is bad. These data must be compared to the results for non-finite VP:

::...and finished the work, John (certainly) has. 
::What John has done is finished the work. 
::What has John done? – Finished the work. 

The strings in bold are the ones in focus. Attempts to in some sense isolate the finite VP fail, but the same attempts with the non-finite VP succeed.

==Narrowly defined==
Verb phrases are sometimes defined more narrowly in scope, in effect counting only those elements considered strictly verbal in verb phrases. That would limit the definition to only main and auxiliary verbs, plus infinitive or participle constructions. For example, in the following sentences only the words in bold form the verb phrase:

:John has given Mary a book.
:The picnickers were being eaten alive by mosquitos.
:She kept screaming like a football maniac.
:Thou shalt not kill.

This more narrow definition is often applied in functionalist frameworks and traditional European reference grammars. It is incompatible with the phrase structure model, because the strings in bold are not constituents under that analysis. It is, however, compatible with dependency grammars and other grammars that view the verb catena (verb chain) as the fundamental unit of syntactic structure, as opposed to the constituent.

<text>Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot ( , , ; 16 July 1796 – 22 February 1875), or simply Camille Corot, was a French landscape and portrait painter as well as a printmaker in etching. A pivotal figure in landscape painting, his vast output simultaneously referenced the Neo-Classical tradition and anticipated the plein-air innovations of Impressionism.

==Biography==
===Early life and training===
Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot was born in Paris on 16 July 1796 in a house at 125 Rue du Bac, now demolished. His family were bourgeois people—his father was a wig maker and his mother, Marie-Françoise Corot, a milliner—and unlike the experience of some of his artistic colleagues, throughout his life he never felt the want of money, as his parents made good investments and ran their businesses well. After his parents married, they bought the millinery shop where his mother had worked and his father gave up his career as a wigmaker to run the business side of the shop. The store was a famous destination for fashionable Parisians and earned the family an excellent income. Corot was the second of three children born to the family, who lived above their shop during those years.

Corot received a scholarship to study at the Lycée Pierre-Corneille in Rouen, but left after having scholastic difficulties and entered a boarding school. He &quot;was not a brilliant student, and throughout his entire school career he did not get a single nomination for a prize, not even for the drawing classes.&quot; Unlike many masters who demonstrated early talent and inclinations toward art, before 1815 Corot showed no such interest. During those years he lived with the Sennegon family, whose patriarch was a friend of Corot&#x27;s father and who spent much time with young Corot on nature walks. It was in this region that Corot made his first paintings after nature. At nineteen, Corot was a &quot;big child, shy and awkward. He blushed when spoken to. Before the beautiful ladies who frequented his mother&#x27;s salon, he was embarrassed and fled like a wild thing... Emotionally, he was an affectionate and well-behaved son, who adored his mother and trembled when his father spoke.&quot; When Corot&#x27;s parents moved into a new residence in 1817, the 21-year-old Corot moved into the dormer-windowed room on the third floor, which became his first studio as well.

With his father&#x27;s help Corot apprenticed to a draper, but he hated commercial life and despised what he called &quot;business tricks&quot;, yet he faithfully remained in the trade until he was 26, when his father consented to him adopting the profession of art. Later Corot stated, &quot;I told my father that business and I were simply incompatible, and that I was getting a divorce.&quot; The business experience proved beneficial, however, by helping him develop an aesthetic sense through his exposure to the colors and textures of the fabrics. Perhaps out of boredom, he turned to oil painting around 1821 and began immediately with landscapes. Starting in 1822 after the death of his sister, Corot began receiving a yearly allowance of 1500 francs which adequately financed his new career, studio, materials, and travel for the rest of his life. He immediately rented a studio on quai Voltaire.

During the period when Corot acquired the means to devote himself to art, landscape painting was on the upswing and generally divided into two camps: one―historical landscape by Neoclassicists in Southern Europe representing idealized views of real and fancied sites peopled with ancient, mythological, and biblical figures; and two―realistic landscape, more common in Northern Europe, which was largely faithful to actual topography, architecture, and flora, and which often showed figures of peasants. In both approaches, landscape artists would typically begin with outdoor sketching and preliminary painting, with finishing work done indoors. Highly influential upon French landscape artists in the early 19th century was the work of Englishmen John Constable and J. M. W. Turner, who reinforced the trend in favor of Realism and away from Neoclassicism.

For a short period between 1821 and 1822, Corot studied with Achille Etna Michallon, a landscape painter of Corot&#x27;s age who was a protégé of the painter Jacques-Louis David and who was already a well-respected teacher. Michallon had a great influence on Corot&#x27;s career. Corot&#x27;s drawing lessons included tracing lithographs, copying three-dimensional forms, and making landscape sketches and paintings outdoors, especially in the forests of Fontainebleau, the seaports along Normandy, and the villages west of Paris such as Ville-d&#x27;Avray (where his parents had a country house). Michallon also exposed him to the principles of the French Neoclassic tradition, as espoused in the famous treatise of theorist Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes, and exemplified in the works of French Neoclassicists Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin, whose major aim was the representation of ideal Beauty in nature, linked with events in ancient times.

Though this school was on the decline, it still held sway in the Salon, the foremost art exhibition in France attended by thousands at each event. Corot later stated, &quot;I made my first landscape from nature...under the eye of this painter, whose only advice was to render with the greatest scrupulousness everything I saw before me. The lesson worked; since then I have always treasured precision.&quot; After Michallon&#x27;s early death in 1822, Corot studied with Michallon&#x27;s teacher, Jean-Victor Bertin, among the best known Neoclassic landscape painters in France, who had Corot draw copies of lithographs of botanical subjects to learn precise organic forms. Though holding Neoclassicists in the highest regard, Corot did not limit his training to their tradition of allegory set in imagined nature. His notebooks reveal precise renderings of tree trunks, rocks, and plants which show the influence of Northern realism. Throughout his career, Corot demonstrated an inclination to apply both traditions in his work, sometimes combining the two.

===First trip to Italy===

With his parents&#x27; support, Corot followed the well-established pattern of French painters who went to Italy to study the masters of the Italian Renaissance and to draw the crumbling monuments of Roman antiquity. A condition by his parents before leaving was that he paint a self-portrait for them, his first. Corot&#x27;s stay in Italy from 1825 to 1828 was a highly formative and productive one, during which he completed over 200 drawings and 150 paintings. He worked and traveled with several young French painters also studying abroad who painted together and socialized at night in the cafes, critiquing each other and gossiping. Corot learned little from the Renaissance masters (though later he cited Leonardo da Vinci as his favorite painter) and spent most of his time around Rome and in the Italian countryside. The Farnese Gardens with its splendid views of the ancient ruins was a frequent destination, and he painted it at three different times of the day. The training was particularly valuable in gaining an understanding of the challenges of both the mid-range and panoramic perspective, and in effectively placing man-made structures in a natural setting. He also learned how to give buildings and rocks the effect of volume and solidity with proper light and shadow, while using a smooth and thin technique. Furthermore, placing suitable figures in a secular setting was a necessity of good landscape painting, to add human context and scale, and it was even more important in allegorical landscapes. To that end Corot worked on figure studies in native garb as well as nude. During winter, he spent time in a studio but returned to work outside as quickly as weather permitted. The intense light of Italy posed considerable challenges, &quot;This sun gives off a light that makes me despair. It makes me feel the utter powerlessness of my palette.&quot; He learned to master the light and to paint the stones and sky in subtle and dramatic variation.

It was not only Italian architecture and light which captured Corot&#x27;s attention. The late-blooming Corot was entranced with Italian females as well: &quot;They still have the most beautiful women in the world that I have met...their eyes, their shoulders, their hands are spectacular. In that, they surpass our women, but on the other hand, they are not their equals in grace and kindness...Myself, as a painter I prefer the Italian woman, but I lean toward the French woman when it comes to emotion.&quot; In spite of his strong attraction to women, he wrote of his commitment to painting: &quot;I have only one goal in life that I want to pursue faithfully: to make landscapes. This firm resolution keeps me from a serious attachment. That is to say, in marriage...but my independent nature and my great need for serious study make me take the matter lightly.&quot;

===Striving for the Salon===
During the six-year period following his first Italian visit and his second, Corot focused on preparing large landscapes for presentation at the Salon. Several of his salon paintings were adaptations of his Italian oil sketches reworked in the studio by adding imagined, formal elements consistent with Neoclassical principles. An example of this was his first Salon entry, &quot;View at Narni&quot; (1827), where he took his quick, natural study of a ruin of a Roman aqueduct in dusty bright sun and transformed it into a falsely idyllic pastoral setting with giant shade trees and green lawns, a conversion meant to appeal to the Neoclassical jurors. Many critics have valued highly his plein-air Italian paintings for their &quot;germ of Impressionism&quot;, their faithfulness to natural light, and their avoidance of academic values, even though they were intended as studies. Several decades later, Impressionism revolutionized art by a taking a similar approach—quick, spontaneous painting done in the out-of-doors; however, where the Impressionists used rapidly applied, un-mixed colors to capture light and mood, Corot usually mixed and blended his colors to get his dreamy effects.

When out of the studio, Corot traveled throughout France, mirroring his Italian methods, and concentrated on rustic landscapes. He returned to the Normandy coast and to Rouen, the city he lived in as a youth. Corot also did some portraits of friends and relatives, and received his first commissions. His sensitive portrait of his niece, Laure Sennegon, dressed in powder blue, was one of his most successful and was later donated to the Louvre. He typically painted two copies of each family portrait, one for the subject and one for the family, and often made copies of his landscapes as well.
In the spring of 1829, Corot came to Barbizon to paint in the Forest of Fontainebleau; he had first painted in the forest at Chailly in 1822. He returned to Barbizon in the autumn of 1830 and in the summer of 1831, where he made drawings and oil studies, from which he made a painting intended for the Salon of 1830; his &quot;View of the Forest of Fontainebleau&quot; (now in the National Gallery in Washington) and, for the Salon of 1831, another &quot;View of the Forest of Fontainebleau&quot;. While there he met the members of the Barbizon school; Théodore Rousseau, Paul Huet, Constant Troyon, Jean-François Millet, and the young Charles-François Daubigny. Corot exhibited one portrait and several landscapes at the Salon in 1831 and 1833. His reception by the critics at the Salon was cool and Corot decided to return to Italy, having failed to satisfy them with his Neoclassical themes.

===Mid-career===
During his two return trips to Italy, he visited Northern Italy, Venice, and again the Roman countryside. In 1835, Corot created a sensation at the Salon with his biblical painting &quot;Agar dans le desert&quot; (Hagar in the Wilderness), which depicted Hagar, Sarah&#x27;s handmaiden, and the child Ishmael, dying of thirst in the desert until saved by an angel. The background was likely derived from an Italian study. This time, Corot&#x27;s unanticipated bold, fresh statement of the Neoclassical ideal succeeded with the critics by demonstrating &quot;the harmony between the setting and the passion or suffering that the painter chooses to depict in it.&quot; He followed that up with other biblical and mythological subjects, but those paintings did not succeed as well, as the Salon critics found him wanting in comparisons with Poussin. In 1837, he painted his earliest surviving nude, &quot;The Nymph of the Seine&quot;. Later, he advised his students &quot;The study of the nude, you see, is the best lesson that a landscape painter can have. If someone knows how, without any tricks, to get down a figure, he is able to make a landscape; otherwise he can never do it.&quot;
Through the 1840s, Corot continued to have his troubles with the critics (many of his works were flatly rejected for Salon exhibition), nor were many works purchased by the public. While recognition and acceptance by the establishment came slowly, by 1845 Baudelaire led a charge pronouncing Corot the leader in the &quot;modern school of landscape painting&quot;. While some critics found Corot&#x27;s colors &quot;pale&quot; and his work having &quot;naive awkwardness&quot;, Baudelaire astutely responded, &quot;M. Corot is more a harmonist than a colorist, and his compositions, which are always entirely free of pedantry, are seductive just because of their simplicity of color.&quot; In 1846, the French government decorated him with the cross of the Légion d&#x27;honneur and in 1848 he was awarded a second-class medal at the Salon, but he received little state patronage as a result. His only commissioned work was a religious painting for a baptismal chapel painted in 1847, in the manner of the Renaissance masters. Though the establishment kept holding back, other painters acknowledged Corot&#x27;s growing stature. In 1847, Delacroix noted in his journal, &quot;Corot is a true artist. One has to see a painter in his own place to get an idea of his worth...Corot delves deeply into a subject: ideas come to him and he adds while working; it&#x27;s the right approach.&quot; Upon Delacroix&#x27;s recommendation, the painter Constant Dutilleux bought a Corot painting and began a long and rewarding relationship with the artist, bringing him friendship and patrons. Corot&#x27;s public treatment dramatically improved after the Revolution of 1848, when he was admitted as a member of the Salon jury. He was promoted to an officer of the Salon in 1867.

Having forsaken any long-term relationships with women, Corot remained very close to his parents even in his fifties. A contemporary said of him, &quot;Corot is a man of principle, unconsciously Christian; he surrenders all his freedom to his mother...he has to beg her repeatedly to get permission to go out...for dinner every other Friday.&quot; Apart from his frequent travels, Corot remained closely tethered to his family until his parents died, then at last he gained the freedom to go as he pleased. That freedom allowed him to take on students for informal sessions, including the Jewish artists Édouard Brandon and future Impressionist Camille Pissarro, who was briefly among them. Corot&#x27;s vigor and perceptive advice impressed his students. Charles Daubigny stated, &quot;He&#x27;s a perfect Old Man Joy, this Father Corot. He is altogether a wonderful man, who mixes jokes in with his very good advice.&quot; Another student said of Corot, &quot;the newspapers had so distorted Corot, putting Theocritus and Virgil in his hands, that I was quite surprised to find him knowing neither Greek nor Latin...His welcome is very open, very free, very amusing: he speaks or listens to you while hopping on one foot or on two; he sings snatches of opera in a very true voice&quot;, but he has a &quot;shrewd, biting side carefully hidden behind his good nature.&quot;

By the mid-1850s, Corot&#x27;s increasingly impressionistic style began to get the recognition that fixed his place in French art. &quot;M. Corot excels...in reproducing vegetation in its fresh beginnings; he marvelously renders the firstlings of the new world.&quot; From the 1850s on, Corot painted many landscape &quot;souvenirs&quot; and &quot;paysages&quot;, dreamy imagined paintings of remembered locations from earlier visits painted with lightly and loosely dabbed strokes.

===Later years===

In the 1860s, Corot was still mixing peasant figures with mythological ones, mixing Neoclassicism with Realism, causing one critic to lament, &quot;If M. Corot would kill, once and for all, the nymphs of his woods and replace them with peasants, I should like him beyond measure.&quot; In reality, in later life his human figures did increase and the nymphs did decrease, but even the human figures were often set in idyllic reveries.

In later life, Corot&#x27;s studio was filled with students, models, friends, collectors, and dealers who came and went under the tolerant eye of the master, causing him to quip, &quot;Why is it that there are ten of you around me, and not one of you thinks to relight my pipe.&quot; Dealers snapped up his works and his prices were often above 4,000 francs per painting. With his success secured, Corot gave generously of his money and time. He became an elder of the artists&#x27; community and would use his influence to gain commissions for other artists. In 1871 he gave £2000 for the poor of Paris, under siege by the Prussians. (see: Franco-Prussian War) During the actual Paris Commune, he was at Arras with Alfred Robaut. In 1872 he bought a house in Auvers as a gift for Honoré Daumier, who by then was blind, without resources, and homeless. In 1875, he donated 10,000 francs to the widow of Millet in support of her children. His charity was near proverbial. He also financially supported the upkeep of a day center for children on rue Vandrezanne in Paris. In later life, he remained a humble and modest man, apolitical and happy with his luck in life, and held close the belief that &quot;men should not puff themselves up with pride, whether they are emperors adding this or that province to their empires or painter who gain a reputation.&quot;

Despite great success and appreciation among artists, collectors, and the more generous critics, his many friends considered, nevertheless, that he was officially neglected, and in 1874, a short time before his death, they presented him with a gold medal. He died in Paris of a stomach disorder aged 78 and was buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery.

A number of followers called themselves Corot&#x27;s pupils. The best known are Camille Pissarro, Eugène Boudin, Berthe Morisot, Stanislas Lépine, Antoine Chintreuil, François-Louis Français, Charles Le Roux, and Alexandre Defaux.

==Art and technique==
Corot is a pivotal figure in landscape painting. His work simultaneously references the Neo-Classical tradition and anticipates the plein-air innovations of Impressionism. Of him Claude Monet exclaimed in 1897, &quot;There is only one master here—Corot. We are nothing compared to him, nothing.&quot; His contributions to figure painting are hardly less important; Degas preferred his figures to his landscapes, and the classical figures of Picasso pay overt homage to Corot&#x27;s influence.

Historians have divided his work into periods, but the points of division are often vague, as he often completed a picture years after he began it. In his early period, he painted traditionally and &quot;tight&quot;—with minute exactness, clear outlines, thin brushwork, and with absolute definition of objects throughout, with a monochromatic underpainting or ébauche. After he reached his 50th year, his methods changed to focus on breadth of tone and an approach to poetic power conveyed with thicker application of paint; and about 20 years later, from about 1865 onwards, his manner of painting became more lyrical, affected with a more impressionistic touch, with brushstrokes becoming more apparent alongside an increased focus on tone. In part, this evolution in expression can be seen as marking the transition from the plein-air paintings of his youth, shot through with warm natural light, to the studio-created landscapes of his late maturity, enveloped in uniform tones of silver. In his final 10 years he became the &quot;Père (Father) Corot&quot; of Parisian artistic circles, where he was regarded with personal affection, and acknowledged as one of the five or six greatest landscape painters the world had seen, along with Meindert Hobbema, Claude Lorrain, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable. In his long and productive life, he painted over 3,000 paintings.

Though often credited as a precursor of Impressionist practice, Corot approached his landscapes more traditionally than is usually believed. Compared to the Impressionists who came later, Corot&#x27;s palette is restrained, dominated with browns and blacks (&quot;forbidden colors&quot; among the Impressionists), along with dark and silvery green. Though appearing at times to be rapid and spontaneous, usually his strokes were controlled and careful, and his compositions well-thought out and generally rendered as simply and concisely as possible, heightening the poetic effect of the imagery. As he stated, &quot;I noticed that everything that was done correctly on the first attempt was more true, and the forms more beautiful.&quot;

Corot&#x27;s approach to his subjects was similarly traditional. Although he was a major proponent of plein-air studies, he was essentially a studio painter and few of his finished landscapes were completed before the motif. For most of his life, Corot would spend his summers travelling and collecting studies and sketches, and his winters finishing more polished, market-ready works. For example, the title of his &quot;Bathers of the Borromean Isles&quot; (1865–1870) refers to Lake Maggiore in Italy, despite the fact that Corot had not been to Italy in 20 years. His emphasis on drawing images from the imagination and memory rather than direct observation was in line with the tastes of the Salon jurors, of which he was a member.

In the 1860s, Corot became interested in photography, taking photos himself and becoming acquainted with many early photographers, which had the effect of suppressing his painting palette even more in sympathy with the monochromic tones of photographs. This had the result of making his paintings even less dramatic but somewhat more poetic, a result which caused some critics to cite a monotony in his later work. Théophile Thoré wrote that Corot &quot;has only a single octave, extremely limited and in a minor key; a musician would say. He knows scarcely more than a single time of day, the morning, and a single color, pale grey.&quot; Corot responded: What there is to see in painting, or rather what I am looking for, is the form, the whole, the value of the tones...That is why for me the color comes after, because I love more than anything else the overall effect, the harmony of the tones, while color gives you a kind of shock that I don&#x27;t like. Perhaps it is the excess of this principal that makes people say I have leaden tones.In his aversion to shocking color, Corot sharply diverged from the up-and-coming Impressionists, who embraced experimentation with vivid hues.
In addition to his landscapes (so popular was the late style that there exist numerous forgeries), Corot produced a number of prized figure pictures. While the subjects were sometimes placed in pastoral settings, these were mostly studio pieces, drawn from the live model with both specificity and subtlety. Like his landscapes, they are characterized by a contemplative lyricism, with his late paintings &quot;L&#x27;Algérienne&quot; (Algerian Woman) and &quot;La Jeune Grecque&quot; (The Greek Girl) being fine examples. Corot painted about fifty portraits, mostly of family and friends. He also painted thirteen reclining nudes, with his &quot;Les Repos&quot; (1860) strikingly similar in pose to Ingres famous &quot;Le Grande Odalisque&quot; (1814), but Corot&#x27;s female is instead a rustic bacchante. In perhaps his last figure painting, &quot;Lady in Blue&quot; (1874), Corot achieves an effect reminiscent of Degas, soft yet expressive. In all cases of his figure painting, the color is restrained and is remarkable for its strength and purity. Corot also executed many etchings and pencil sketches. Some of the sketches used a system of visual symbols—circles representing areas of light and squares representing shadow. He also experimented with the cliché verre process—a hybrid of photography and engraving. Starting in the 1830s, Corot also painted decorative panels and walls in the homes of friends, aided by his students.

Corot summed up his approach to art around 1860: &quot;I interpret with my art as much as with my eye.&quot;

The works of Corot are housed in museums in France and the Netherlands, Britain, North America and Russia.

==Forgeries==
The strong market for Corot&#x27;s works and his relatively easy-to-imitate late painting style resulted in a huge production of Corot forgeries between 1870 and 1939. René Huyghe famously quipped that &quot;Corot painted three thousand canvases, ten thousand of which have been sold in America&quot;. Although this is a humorous exaggeration, thousands of forgeries have been amassed, with the Jousseaume collection alone containing 2,414 such works. Adding to the problem was Corot&#x27;s lax attitude which encouraged copying and forgery. He allowed his students to copy his works and to even borrow the works for later return, he would touch up and sign student and collector copies, and he would loan works to professional copiers and to rental agencies. According to Corot cataloguist Etienne Moreau-Nélaton, at one copying studio &quot;The master&#x27;s complacent brush authenticated these replicas with a few personal and decisive retouchings. When he was no longer there to finish his &quot;doubles&quot;, they went on producing them without him.&quot; The cataloging of Corot&#x27;s works in an attempt to separate the copies from the originals backfired when forgers used the publications as guides to expand and refine their bogus paintings.

==In popular culture==
Two of Corot&#x27;s works are featured and play an important role in the plot of the 2008 French film &quot;L&#x27;Heure d&#x27;été&quot; (English title &quot;Summer Hour&quot;). The film was produced by the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, and the two works were lent by the museum for the making of the film.

There is a street named Rue Corot on Île des Sœurs, Quebec, named for the artist.

In Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s 1890 novel &quot;The Sign of the Four&quot; Thaddeus Sholto has an unknown work of Corot on display.

<text>CoRoT (French: ; English: Convection, Rotation and planetary Transits) was a space telescope mission which operated from 2006 to 2013. The mission&#x27;s two objectives were to search for extrasolar planets with short orbital periods, particularly those of large terrestrial size, and to perform asteroseismology by measuring solar-like oscillations in stars. The mission was led by the French Space Agency (CNES) in conjunction with the European Space Agency (ESA) and other international partners.

Among the notable discoveries was CoRoT-7b, discovered in 2009 which became the first exoplanet shown to have a rock or metal-dominated composition.

CoRoT was launched at 14:28:00 UTC on 27 December 2006, atop a Soyuz 2.1b rocket, reporting first light on 18 January 2007. Subsequently, the probe started to collect science data on 2 February 2007. CoRoT was the first spacecraft dedicated to the detection of transiting extrasolar planets, opening the way for more advanced probes such as Kepler and TESS. It detected its first extrasolar planet, CoRoT-1b, in May 2007, just 3 months after the start of the observations. Mission flight operations were originally scheduled to end 2.5 years from launch but operations were extended to 2013. On 2 November 2012, CoRoT suffered a computer failure that made it impossible to retrieve any data from its telescope. Repair attempts were unsuccessful, so on 24 June 2013 it was announced that CoRoT had been retired and would be decommissioned; lowered in orbit to allow it to burn up in the atmosphere.

==Overview==

===Spacecraft design===

The CoRoT optical design minimized stray light coming from the Earth and provided a field of view of 2.7° by 3.05°. The CoRoT optical path consisted of a diameter off-axis afocal telescope housed in a two-stage opaque baffle specifically designed to block sunlight reflected by the Earth and a camera consisting of a dioptric objective and a focal box. Inside the focal box was an array of four CCD detectors protected against radiation by aluminum shielding 10mm thick. The asteroseismology CCDs are defocused by 760μm toward the dioptric objective to avoid saturation of the brightest stars. A prism in front of the planet detection CCDs gives a small spectrum designed to disperse more strongly in the blue wavelengths.

The four CCD detectors are model 4280 CCDs provided by E2V Technologies. These CCDs are frame-transfer, thinned, back-illuminated designs in a 2,048 by 2,048 pixel array. Each pixel is in size which corresponds to an angular pixel size of 2.32 arcsec. The CCDs are cooled to . These detectors are arranged in a square pattern with two each dedicated to the planetary detection and asteroseismology. The data output stream from the CCDs are connected in two &quot;chains&quot;. Each chain has one planetary detection CCD and one asteroseismology CCD. The field of view for planetary detection is 3.5°.
The satellite, built in the Cannes Mandelieu Space Center, had a launch mass of 630 kg, was 4.10 m long, 1.984 m in diameter and was powered by two solar panels.

===Mission design===

The satellite observed perpendicular to its orbital plane, meaning there were no Earth occultations, allowing up to 150 days of continuous observation. These observation sessions, called &quot;Long Runs&quot;, allowed detection of smaller and long-period planets. During the remaining 30 days between the two main observation periods, CoRoT observed other patches of sky for a few weeks long &quot;Short Runs&quot;, in order to analyze a larger number of stars for the asteroseismic program. After the loss of half the field of view due to failure of Data Processing Unit No. 1 in March 2009, the observation strategy changed to 3 months observing runs, in order to optimize the number of observed stars and detection efficiency.

In order to avoid the Sun entering in its field of view, during the northern summer CoRoT observed in an area around Serpens Cauda, toward the Galactic Center, and during the winter it observed in Monoceros, in the Galactic anticenter. Both these &quot;eyes&quot; of CoRoT have been studied in preliminary observations carried out between 1998 and 2005, allowing the creation of a database, called CoRoTsky, with data about the stars located in these two patches of sky. This allowed selecting the best fields for observation: the exoplanet research program requires a large number of dwarf stars to be monitored, and to avoid giant stars, for which planetary transits are too shallow to be detectable. The asteroseismic program required stars brighter than magnitude 9, and to cover as many different types of stars as possible. In addition, in order to optimize the observations, the fields had to not be too sparse – fewer targets observed – or too crowded – too many stars overlapping. 
Several fields were observed during the mission:
*IRa01, from 18 January 2007 to 3 April 2007 – 9,879 stars observed;
*SRc01, from 3 April 2007 to 9 May 2007 – 6,975 stars observed;

*LRc03, from 30 March 2009 to 2 July 2009 – 5,661 stars observed;
*LRc04, from 2 July 2009 to 30 September 2009 – 5,716 stars observed;
*LRa03, from 30 September 2009 to 1 March 2010 – 5,289 stars observed;
*SRa03, from 1 March 2010 to 2 April 2010;
*LRc05, from 2 April 2010 to 5 July 2010;
*LRc06, from 5 July 2010 to 27 September 2010;
*LRa04, from 27 September 2010 to 16 December 2010;
*LRa05, from 16 December 2010 to 5 April 2011;
*LRc07, from 5 April 2011 to 30 June 2011;
*SRc03, from 1 July 2011 to 5 July 2011 – a run made to reobserve the transit of CoRoT-9b;
*LRc08, from 6 July 2011 to 30 September 2011;
*SRa04, from 30 September 2011 to 28 November 2011;
*SRa05, from 29 November 2011 to 9 January 2012;
*LRa06, from 10 January 2012 to 29 March 2012 – a run dedicated to reobservation of CoRoT-7b;
*LRc09, from 10 April 2012 to 5 July 2012;
*LRc10, from 6 July 2012 to 1 November 2012 - interrupted by the fatal failure which ended the mission.

The spacecraft monitored the brightness of stars over time, searching for the slight dimming that happens in regular intervals when planets transit their host star. In every field, CoRoT recorded the brightness of thousands stars in the V-magnitude range from 11 to 16 for the extrasolar planet study. In fact, stellar targets brighter than 11 saturated the exoplanets CCD detectors, yielding inaccurate data, whilst stars dimmer than 16 do not deliver enough photons to allow planetary detections. CoRoT was sensitive enough to detect rocky planets with a radius two times larger than Earth, orbiting stars brighter than 14; it is also expected to discover new gas giants in the whole magnitude range.

CoRoT also studied asteroseismology. It can detect luminosity variations associated with acoustic pulsations of stars. This phenomenon allows calculation of a star&#x27;s precise mass, age and chemical composition and will aid in comparisons between the sun and other stars. For this program, in each field of view there was one main target star for asteroseismology as well as up to nine other targets. The number of observed targets have dropped to half after the loss of Data Processing Unit No. 1.

The mission began on 27 December 2006 when a Russian Soyuz 2-1b rocket lifted the satellite into a circular polar orbit with an altitude of 827 km . The first scientific observation campaign started on 3 February 2007.

The mission&#x27;s cost amounted to , of which 75% was paid by the French space agency CNES and 25% was contributed by Austria, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Brazil and the European Space Agency (ESA).

==Development==

The primary contractor for the construction of the CoRoT vehicle was CNES, to which individual components were delivered for vehicle assembly. The CoRoT equipment bay, which houses the data acquisition and pre-processing electronics, was constructed by the LESIA Laboratory at the Paris Observatory and took 60 to complete. The design and building of the instruments were done by the Laboratoire d&#x27;études spatiales et d&#x27;instrumentation en astrophysique (LESIA) de l&#x27;Observatoire de Paris, the Laboratoire d&#x27;Astrophysique de Marseille, the Institut d&#x27;Astrophysique Spatiale (IAS) from Orsay, the Centre spatial de Liège (CSL) in Belgium, the IWF in Austria, the DLR (Berlin) in Germany and the ESA Research and Science Support Department. The 30 cm afocal telescope Corotel has been realized by Alcatel Alenia Space in the Centre spatial de Cannes Mandelieu.

==Potential==
Before the beginning of the mission, the team stated with caution that CoRoT would only be able to detect planets few times larger than Earth or greater, and that it was not specifically designed to detect habitable planets. According to the press release announcing the first results, CoRoT&#x27;s instruments are performing with higher precision than had been predicted, and may be able to find planets down to the size of Earth with short orbits around small stars.
The transit method requires the detection of at least two transits, hence the planets detected will mostly have an orbital period under 75-day. Candidates that show only one transit have been found, but uncertainty remains about their exact orbital period.

CoRoT should be assumed to detect a small percentage of planets within the observed star fields, due to the low percentage of exoplanets that would transit from the angle of observation of the Solar System. The chances of seeing a planet transiting its host star is inversely proportional to the diameter of the planet&#x27;s orbit, thus close in planets detections will outnumber outer planets ones. The transit method is also biased toward large planets, since their very depth transits are more easily detected than the shallows eclipses induced by terrestrial planets.

==Failure of Data Processing Unit No. 1==
On 8 March 2009 the satellite suffered a loss of communication with Data Processing Unit No. 1, processing data from one of the two photo-detector chains on the spacecraft. Science operations resumed early April with Data Processing Unit No. 1 offline while Data Processing Unit No. 2 operating normally. The loss of photo-detector chain number 1 results in the loss of one CCD dedicated to asteroseismology and one CCD dedicated to planet detection. The field of view of the satellite is thus reduced by 50%, but without any degradation of the quality of the observations. The loss of channel 1 appears to be permanent.

==Follow-up program==
The rate of discoveries of transiting planets is dictated by the need of ground-based, follow-up observations, needed to verify the planetary nature of the transit candidates. Candidate detections have been obtained for about 2.3% of all CoRoT targets, but finding periodic transit events isn&#x27;t enough to claim a planet discovery, since several configurations could mimic a transiting planet, such as stellar binaries, or an eclipsing fainter star very close to the target star, whose light, blended in the light curve, can reproduce transit-like events. A first screening is executed on the light curves, searching hints of secondary eclipses or a rather V-shaped transit, indicative of a stellar nature of the transits. For the brighter targets, the prism in front of the exoplanets CCDs provides photometry in 3 different colors, enabling to reject planet candidates that have different transit depths in the three channels, a behaviour typical of binary stars. These tests allow to discard 83% of the candidate detections, whilst the remaining 17% are screened with photometric and radial velocity follow-up from a network of telescopes around the world. Photometric observations, required to rule out a possible contamination by a diluted eclipsing binary in close vicinity of the target, is performed on several 1 m-class instruments, but also employs the 2 m Tautenburg telescope in Germany and the 3,6 m CFHT/Megacam in Hawaii. The radial velocity follow-up allows to discard binaries or even multiple star system and, given enough observations, provide the mass of the exoplanets found. Radial velocity follow-up is performed with high-precision spectrographs, namely SOPHIE, HARPS and HIRES. Once the planetary nature of the candidate is established, high-resolution spectroscopy is performed on the host star, in order to accurately determine the stellar parameters, from which further exoplanet characteristics can be derived. Such work is done with large aperture telescopes, as the UVES spectrograph or HIRES.

Interesting transiting planets could be further followed-up with the infrared Spitzer Space Telescope, to give an independent confirmation at a different wavelength and possibly detect reflected light from the planet or the atmospheric compositions. CoRoT-7b and CoRoT-9b have already been observed by Spitzer.

Papers presenting the results of follow-up operations of planetary candidates in the IRa01, LRc01, LRa01, SRc01 fields have been published. 
In April 2019, a summary of the exoplanet search results have been published, with 37 planets and brown dwarves confirmed, and a further one hundred planet candidates still to be verified.
Sometimes the faintness of the target star or its characteristics, such as a high rotational velocity or strong stellar activity, do not allow to determine unambiguously the nature or the mass of the planetary candidate.

=== Asteroseismology and stellar physics ===

Stars vibrate according to many different pulsation modes in much the same way that musical instruments emit a variety of sounds. Listening to an air on the guitar does not leave any doubt as to the nature of the instrument, and an experienced musician can even deduce the cords&#x27; material and tension. Similarly, stellar pulsation modes are characteristic of global stellar properties and of the internal physical conditions. Analyzing these modes is thus a way of probing stellar interiors to infer stellar chemical composition, rotation profiles and internal physical properties such as temperatures and densities. Asteroseismology is the science which studies the vibration modes of a star. Each of these modes can be mathematically represented by a spherical harmonic of degree l and azimuthal order m. Some examples are presented here below with a color scheme in which blue (red) indicates contracting (expanding) material. The pulsation amplitudes are highly exaggerated.

When applied to the Sun, this science is called helioseismology and has been ongoing for a few decades by now. The solar surface helium abundance was derived very accurately for the first time, which has definitely shown the importance of microscopic diffusion in the solar structure. Helioseismology analyses have also unveiled the solar internal rotational profile, the precise extent of the convective envelope and the location of the helium ionization zone. Despite enormous technical challenges, it was thus tempting to apply similar analyses to stars. From the ground this was only possible for stars close to the Sun such as α Centauri, Procyon, β Virginis... The goal is to detect extremely small light variations (down to 1 ppm) and to extract the frequencies responsible for these brightness fluctuations. This produces a frequency spectrum typical of the star under scrutiny. Oscillation periods vary from a few minutes to several hours depending on the type of star and its evolutionary state. To reach such performances, long observing times devoid of day/night alternations are required. Space is thus the ideal asteroseismic laboratory. By revealing their microvariability, measuring their oscillations at the ppm level, CoRoT has provided a new vision of stars, never reached before by any ground-based observation.

At the beginning of the mission, two out of four CCDs were assigned to asteroseismic observations of bright stars (apparent magnitude 6 to 9) in the so-called &quot;seismo field&quot; while the other CCDs were reserved for exoplanet hunting in the so-called &quot;exo field&quot;. Albeit with a lower signal to noise ratio, interesting science on stars was also obtained from the exoplanets channel data, where the probe records several thousands of light curves from every observed field. Stellar activity, rotation periods, star spot evolution, star–planet interactions, multiple star systems are nice extras in addition to the main asteroseismic program. This exo field also turned out to be of incalculable richness in asteroseismic discoveries. During the first six years of its mission, CoRoT has observed about 150 bright stars in the &quot;seismo field&quot; and more than 150 000 weak stars in the &quot;exo field&quot;. The figure shows where most of them are located in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram together with some others observed from the ground.

Discoveries were numerous, including the first detection of solar-like oscillations in stars other than the Sun, the first detection of non-radial oscillations in red giant stars, the detection of solar-like oscillations in massive stars, the discovery of hundreds of frequencies in δ Scuti stars, the spectacular time evolution of the frequency spectrum of a Be (emission lines B) star during an outburst, the first detection of a deviation from a constant period spacing in gravity modes in an SPB (Slowly Pulsating B) star. Interpreting those results opened new horizons in humanity&#x27;s vision of stars and galaxies. In October 2009 the CoRoT mission was the subject of a special issue of &quot;Astronomy and Astrophysics&quot;, dedicated to the early results of the probe. Below are some examples of breakthrough contributions to stellar astrophysics, based on CoRoT&#x27;s data:

==== Extension of the chemically mixed zone in main sequence stars ====

Above the convective core where mixing of chemicals is instantaneous and efficient, some layers can be affected by partial or total mixing during the main sequence phase of evolution. The extent of this &quot;extra mixed zone&quot; as well as the mixing efficiency are, however, difficult to assess. This additional mixing has very important consequences since it involves longer time scales for nuclear burning phases and may in particular affect the value of the stellar mass at the transition between those stars which end up their life as white dwarfs and those which face a final supernova explosion. The impact on the chemical evolution of the galaxy is obvious. Physical reasons for this extra-mixing are various, either a mixing induced by internal rotation or a mixing resulting from convective bubbles crossing the convective core boundary to enter the radiative zone where they finally lose their identity (overshooting), or even some other poorly known processes.
# Solar-like stars: The solar-like star HD 49933 is illustrative of this extra-mixing problem. Its convective envelope is responsible for the presence of solar-like oscillations. Comparing the observed frequency spectrum with that obtained from theoretical models of 1.19 Mʘ computed with and without additional mixing clearly excludes a model without extra mixing.
# Sub-giant stars: Such an additional mixing also affects the structure of more evolved sub-giant stars since the mass extension of the helium core formed during core hydrogen burning is increased. The sub-giant star HD 49385 of 1.3 Mʘ was submitted to CoRoT scrutiny and although not fully conclusive, new constraints were brought to the modeling of such stars.
# SPB stars: More massive SPB (Slowly Pulsating B) stars show a frequency spectrum dominated by high order gravity modes excited by the κ mechanism at work in layers where ionizations of iron group elements produces an opacity peak. In such stars, the convective core is surrounded by a region of varying chemical composition, the so-called μ-gradient region, left by the progressive withdrawal of the convective core as hydrogen is transformed into helium. This region is rather thin and constitutes a sharp transition region, which induces a very subtle signature in the gravity modes frequency spectrum. Instead of a constant period spacing found in a homogeneous stellar model, periodic deviations from this constant value are expected in models affected by a sharp transition region. Moreover, the period of the deviations is directly related to the precise location of the sharp transition. This phenomenon has been detected in two hybrid B stars (showing at the same time acoustic β Cephei and gravity SPB modes): (1) HD 50230 where an extra-mixing with a somewhat smooth shape is clearly required in the modeling and (2) HD 43317.

==== Structure of the superficial stellar layers ====

# Transition layers in stellar envelopes: Transition layers such as the helium ionization region or the lower boundary of the convective envelope in low mass and red giant stars also affect frequency spectra. In a structure devoid of such discontinuities, high order acoustic modes obey some regularities in their frequency distribution (large frequency separation, second difference...). Transition zones introduce periodic deviations with respect to these regularities and the periods of the deviations are directly related to the precise location of the transition zones. These deviations were predicted by theory and were first observed in the Sun. Thanks to CoRoT they were also detected in the solar-like star HD 49933 and also in the red giant star HD 181907. In both cases the location of the helium ionization zone could be accurately derived.
# Amplitudes and line widths in solar-like oscillation spectra: One of the major successes of the CoRoT space mission has definitely been the detection of solar-like oscillations in stars slightly hotter than the Sun. As was previously done for the Sun, measurements of amplitudes and line widths in their frequency spectra resulted in new constraints in the modeling of stochastic excitations of acoustic modes by turbulent convection. The frequency spectrum of HD 49933 was confronted to the stochastic excitation model developed by Samadi et al. Except at high frequencies, a good agreement can be reached by adopting a metallicity ten times smaller than the solar metallicity. With the solar value on the contrary, disagreements in amplitudes can reach a factor 2 at low frequencies.
# Granulation: The presence of granulation was detected in the frequency spectrum of HD 49933. Analyses have been done with 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres computed at solar and ten times smaller than solar metallicities. Here again the model with the lowest metallicity shows up to be closer to the observations although significant disagreements still remain.

==== Red giants and chemical evolution of this galaxy ====

Following exhaustion of hydrogen in the core, the overall stellar structure drastically changes. Hydrogen burning now takes place in a narrow shell surrounding the newly processed helium core. While the helium core quickly contracts and heats up, the layers above the hydrogen-burning shell undergo important expansion and cooling. The star becomes a red giant whose radius and luminosity increase in time. These stars are now located on the so-called red giant branch of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram; they are commonly named &quot;RGB stars&quot;. Once their central temperature reaches 100 106 K, helium starts burning in the core. For stellar masses smaller than about 2 Mʘ, this new combustion takes place in a highly degenerate matter and proceeds through a helium flash. The readjustment following the flash brings the red giant to the so-called red clump (RC) in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.


Whether RGB or RC, these stars all have an extended convective envelope favorable to the excitation of solar-like oscillations. A major success of CoRoT has been the discovery of radial and long-lived non-radial oscillations in thousands of red giants in the exo field. For each of them, the frequency at maximum power νmax in the frequency spectrum as well as the large frequency separation between consecutive modes Δν could be measured, defining a sort of individual seismic passport.

# Red giant population in this galaxy: Introducing these seismic signatures, together with an estimation of the effective temperature, in the scaling laws relating them to the global stellar properties, gravities (seismic gravities), masses and radii can be estimated and luminosities and distances immediately follow for those thousands of red giants. Histograms could then be drawn and a totally unexpected and spectacular result came out when comparing these CoRoT histograms with theoretical ones obtained from theoretical synthetic populations of red giants in this galaxy. Such theoretical populations were computed from stellar evolution models, with adopting various hypotheses to describe the successive generations of stars along the time evolution of this galaxy. Andrea Miglio and collaborators noticed that both types of histograms were spitting images of one another, as can be seen in the histograms picture. Moreover, adding the knowledge of the distances of these thousands of stars to their galactic coordinates, a 3D map of this galaxy was drawn. This is illustrated in the figure where different colors relate to different CoRoT runs and to &quot;Kepler&quot; observations (green points).
# Age-metallicity relation in this galaxy: The age of a red giant is closely related to its former main sequence lifetime, which is in turn determined by its mass and metallicity. Knowing the mass of a red giant amounts to knowing its age. If the metallicity is known the uncertainty in age does not exceed 15%! Observational missions such as APOGEE &quot;(Apache Point Observatoty Galactic Evolution Environment)&quot; whose goal is to measure metallicities for 100 000 red giants in this galaxy, GALAH &quot;(Galactic Archaeology with HERMES)&quot; and GAIA &quot;(Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics)&quot; could of course widely benefit from these seismic gravities with the ultimate output of establishing the age-metallicity relation in this galaxy. Asteroseismology has crossed the doorstep of the structure and chemical evolution of this galaxy.
# Seismic signatures and extension of mixed zones during central hydrogen and helium burning: Increasing even further the scrutiny in analyzing the CoRoT and &quot;Kepler&quot; frequency spectra of red giants brought new important discoveries. Small and subtle differences in seismic signatures allow us to distinguish RGB from RC stars notwithstanding their similar luminosities. This is now theoretically confirmed thanks to elaborate red giant modeling. The period spacings of gravity-dominated modes are expected to be especially meaningful. Their detection for a large number of red giants could give us clues to establishing the extent of the extra-mixed region above the convective core during core hydrogen burning, but also the extent of the extra-mixed region during core helium burning, both mixing processes being &quot;a priori&quot; totally unrelated.

==== Massive stars ====

Massive variable main sequence stars have frequency spectra dominated by acoustic modes excited by the κ mechanism at work in layers where partial ionization of iron group elements produce a peak in opacity. In addition the most advanced of these stars present mixed modes i.e. modes with a g-character in deep layers and p-character in the envelope. Hydrogen burning takes place in a convective core surrounded by a region of varying chemical composition and an envelope mostly radiative except for tiny convective layers related to partial ionization of helium and/or iron group elements. As in lower mass stars the extent of the fully or partially mixed region located just above the convective core &quot;(extra-mixed zone)&quot; is one of the main uncertainties affecting theoretical modeling.
# β Cephei stars: Seismic analyses of β Cephei stars show that it is not obvious to derive a one-to-one extent of this extra-mixed zone. A rather large extent seems to be required to model θ Ophiuchi while a much smaller one is favored for HD 129929, for β Canis Majoris, for δ Ceti, and for 12 Lacertae. This extra-mixed zone could even be absent in the structure of V1449 Aquilae (HD 180642) and ν Eridani. It would be extremely interesting to establish a relation between the extent of this zone and the rotation velocity and/or the magnetic field of the star. Seismic analysis of V2052 Ophiuchi shows that this star although rapidly rotating, which would favor extra-mixing, could be devoid of such a region. The magnetic field detected in this star could be the reason of this lack of extra-mixing.
# Be stars: Late Be type stars HD 181231 and HD 175869 are very rapid rotators, about 20 times more rapid than the Sun. Their seismic analysis seems to require a centrally mixed zone about 20% larger than what is expected from convection only. Another Be star, HD 49330, had a very exciting surprise in store. Observed by CoRoT during an outburst of matter towards its circumstellar disk, which is typical of such stars, its frequency spectrum suffered drastic changes. Firstly dominated by acoustic modes the spectrum showed the appearance of gravity modes with amplitudes strictly in line with the outburst. Such a link between the nature of the excited modes and a dynamical phenomenon is of course a gold mine in the quest for the internal structure of Be stars.
# O stars: Many O stars have been observed by CoRoT. Among them HD 46150 and HD 46223 (members of the galactic cluster NGC 2264) and HD 46966 (member of the OB association Mon OB2) do not seem to pulsate, which is in agreement with stellar modeling of stars with similar global parameters. The frequency spectrum of the Plaskett&#x27;s star HD 47129 on the contrary shows a peak with six harmonics in the frequency range expected from theoretical modeling.

Another unexpected CoRoT discovery was the presence of solar-like oscillations in massive stars. The small convective shell related to the opacity peak resulting from the ionization of iron group elements at about 200 000 K (iron opacity peak) could indeed be responsible for the stochastic excitation of acoustic modes like those observed in the Sun.
# V1449 Aquilae (HD 180642): This CoRoT target is a β Cephei star whose frequency spectrum reveals high frequency and very small amplitude acoustic modes. A careful analysis has shown that they were solar-like oscillations excited by turbulent bubbles origination from this convective iron opacity peak zone or even from the convective core. This is indeed a major discovery since it was the first time that pulsations excited by the κ mechanism acting in the iron opacity peak zone were present side by side in the same star with pulsations stochastically excited by this very same zone. This is the reason why Kevin Belkacem, main discoverer of these solar-like oscillations in V1449 Aquilae, added a new baptismal certificate to this β Cephei star and named it &quot;Chimera&quot;. The figure illustrates the behavior of the frequency versus time for two modes in the frequency spectrum of Chimera, a solar-like mode (top) and a β Cephei mode (bottom). The stochastic nature of the solar-like mode reveals itself in the instability of its frequency as time goes on and in the spread in frequency on several μHz. The contrast with the stability in frequency and the narrow frequency range of the β Cephei mode is striking.
# HD 46149: Later on solar-like oscillations were even discovered in a more massive O star member of the binary system HD 46149. Constraints coming from the binary nature of the system coupled with seismic constraints led to the determination of the orbital parameters of the system as well as to the global properties of its members.

==== The open cluster NGC 2264 ====

During a 23-day observing run in March 2008, CoRoT observed 636 members of the young open cluster NGC 2264. The so-called &quot;Christmas tree cluster&quot;, is located in the constellation Monoceros relatively close to us at a distance of about 1800 light years. Its age is estimated to be between 3 and 8 million years. At such a young age, the cluster is an ideal target to investigate many different scientific questions connected to the formation of stars and early stellar evolution. The CoRoT data of stars in NGC 2264 allow us to study the interaction of recently formed stars with their surrounding matter, the rotation and activity of cluster members as well as their distribution, the interiors of young stars by using asteroseismology, and planetary and stellar eclipses.

The stellar births and the stars&#x27; childhoods remain mostly hidden from us in the optical light because the early stars are deeply embedded in the dense molecular cloud from which they are born. Observations in the infrared or X-ray enable us to look deeper into the cloud, and learn more about these earliest phases in stellar evolution.
Therefore, in December 2011 and January 2012, CoRoT was part of a large international observing campaign involving four space telescopes and several ground-based observatories. All instruments observed about 4000 stars in the young cluster NGC 2264 simultaneously for about one month at different wavelengths. The Canadian space mission MOST targeted the brightest stars in the cluster in the optical light, while CoRoT observed the fainter members. MOST and CoRoT observed NGC 2264 continuously for 39 days. The NASA satellites Spitzer and Chandra measured at the same time the stars in the infrared (for 30 days) and the X-ray domains (for 300 kiloseconds). Ground-based observations were taken also at the same time, for example, with the ESO Very Large Telescope in Chile, the Canadian-French-Hawaiian Telescope in Hawaii, the McDonald Observatory in Texas, or the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.

The CoRoT observations led to the discovery of about a dozen pulsating pre-main sequence (PMS) δ Scuti stars and the confirmation of the existence of γ Doradus pulsations in PMS stars. Also the presence of hybrid δ Scuti/γ Doradus pulsations was confirmed in members of NGC 2264. The CoRoT observations included also the well known pre-main sequence pulsators, V 588 Mon and V 589 Mon, which were the first discovered members of this group of stars. The precision attained in the CoRoT light curves also revealed the important role of granulation in pre-main sequence stars.

The investigation of T Tauri stars and their interaction with their circumstellar matter using CoRoT data revealed the existence of a new class, the AA Tauri type objects. Previously to the CoRoT observations, T Tauri stars were known to either show sinusoidal light variations that are caused by spots on the stellar surface, or completely irregular variability that is caused by the gas and dust disks surrounding the young stars. AA Tauri type objects show periodically occurring minima that are different in depth and width, hence are semi-regular variables. With the CoRoT observations this class of objects could be established. Exciting insights into the earliest phases of stellar evolution also come from the comparison of the variability present in the optical light to that in the infrared and the X-ray regime.

==== Binary systems ====

A large number of binary systems with non-radially pulsating members were observed by CoRoT. Some of them, which were eclipsing binaries with members of γ Doradus type, were discovered during CoRoT runs. The eclipse phenomenon plays a key role since global parameters can immediately follow, bringing invaluable constraints, in addition to the seismic ones, to stellar modeling.

# AU Monocerotis: This semi-detached binary system contains a Be star interacting with its G star companion. Its observation by CoRoT provided an extremely high quality lightcurve. Global parameters could then be improved and new ephemeris for the orbital motion as well as for another long term variation were derived. This long period variation seems to originate from a periodic light attenuation by circumstellar dust. 
# HD 174884: Tidally induced pulsations have been detected in the high eccentricity (e=0.29) and short period binary system HD 174884 consisting of two B stars. The upper panel of the figure shows the full light curve of the system. In the second panel tiny secondary eclipses are seen with a depth of about 1% of the depth of the primary eclipse. Actually the system is formed of stars of similar mass, size and temperature. Were the orbit circular, the eclipses would be similar in depth. However the orbit is highly eccentric and its orientation in space with respect to us is such that the secondary eclipse occurs when the stars are at a larger distance than at primary eclipse. The third panel of the figure shows the projection on the plane of the sky (i.e. the system as we see it) at different orbital phases.
# CoRoT 102918586 (alias CoRoT Sol 1): The relatively bright eclipsing system CoRoT 102918586 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary, observed by CoRoT, which revealed clear evidence of γ Doradus type pulsations. In addition to CoRoT photometry, a spectroscopic follow-up was performed which yielded the radial velocity curves, the component effective temperatures, the metallicity, and the line-of-sight projected rotational velocities. The eclipsing binary light curve analysis, combined with the spectroscopic results, provided system physical parameters with 1–2% accuracy while the comparison with evolutionary models led to constraints on the age of the system. After subtracting the best–fitting eclipsing binary model, the residuals were analyzed to determine the pulsation properties. The primary star pulsates with typical γ Dor frequencies and shows a period spacing consistent with high order g-modes of degree l=1.
# HR 6902: The binary system HR 6902 containing a red giant and a B star was observed by CoRoT during two runs, which allowed us to fully cover the primary as well as the secondary eclipses. This system is presently being analyzed with the ultimate goal of bringing new constraints on the internal structure of the red giant in particular.
# A low mass binary: One of the binary system observed by CoRoT is of particular interest since the less massive component is a late M star of 0.23 M⊙ with an estimated effective temperature of about 3000 K. The primary component is a 1.5 M⊙ star MS star.
# A beaming effect in a binary: A binary system observed by CoRoT showed out of eclipses variations which were interpreted as a beaming effect (also called Doppler boosting). This effect results from the variation in brightness of source approaching or moving away from the observer, with an amplitude proportional to the radial velocity divided by the speed of light. The periodic variation in the velocity of an orbiting star will thus produce a periodic beaming variation in the light curve. Such an effect can confirm the binary nature of a system even without any detectable eclipses nor transits. One of the main advantages of the beaming effect is the possibility to determine the radial velocity directly from the light curve but very different luminosities of the binary components are required and a single radial velocity curve can only be obtained as in an SB1 binary system. The out of eclipse variations were modeled with the BEER (Beaming Ellipsoidal Reflection) algorithm.

===Exoplanets===

To find extra solar planets, CoRoT uses the method of transits detection. The primary transit is the occultation of a fraction of the light from a star when a celestial object, such as a planet, passes between the star and the observer. Its detection is made possible by the sensitivity of CCD to very small changes in light flux. Corot is capable of detecting changes in brightness of about 1/10,000. Scientists can thus hope finding planets with a size of approximately 2 times that of the Earth with this method, a class of planet called Super-Earth; detection of Corot-7b, whose radius is 1.7 times that of the Earth has shown that these predictions were correct. CoRoT takes an exposure of 32 seconds duration, each 32 seconds, but the image is not fully transmitted to Earth because the data flow would be too large. The onboard computer performs an important work of data reduction: the field around each target star, previously selected by the exoplanets team, is defined on a certain number of pixels described by a particular mask, the sum all pixels within the mask is then performed and several exposures are added (usually 16, which amounts to an integration time of about 8 minutes) before sending this information to the ground. For some stars, considered particularly of interest, data of each exposure is transmitted every 32 seconds. Such a sampling of 32s or 512s is well suited to the detection of a planetary transit that lasts from a little less than an hour to several hours.
A feature of this method is that it requires to detect at least three successive transits separated by two equal time intervals before one can consider a target as a serious candidate. A planet of orbital period &quot;T&quot; should at least be observed for a time interval between 2&quot;T&quot; and 3&quot;T&quot; to have a chance to detect three transits. The distance of the planet to the star ( which is characterized by &quot;a&quot; the semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit ) is linked to its orbital period by the second law of Kepler / Newton &quot;a&quot;3 = &quot;T&quot;2 Mstar, using respectively as units for &quot;a&quot;, M and &quot;T&quot;: the distance from the Earth to the Sun (150 million km), the mass of the Sun, the orbital period of the Earth (1 year); this implies that if the observing time is less a year, for example, the orbits of the detectable planets will be significantly smaller than that of the Earth.
So, for CoRoT, due to the maximum duration of 6 months of observation for each star field, only planets closer to their stars than 0.3 Astronomic Units (less than the distance between the Sun and Mercury) can be detected, therefore generally not in the so-called habitable zone. The Kepler mission (NASA) has continuously observed the same field for many years and thus had the ability to detect Earth sized planets located farther from their stars.

The moderate number of exoplanets discovered by CoRoT (34 during the 6 years of operation), is explained by the fact that a confirmation should absolutely be provided by ground-based telescopes, before any announcement is made. Indeed, in the vast majority of cases, the detection of several transits does not mean the detection of a planet, but rather that of a binary star system, either one that corresponds to a grazing occultation of a star by the other, or that the system is close enough to a bright star (the CoRoT target) and the effect of transit is diluted by the light of this star; in both cases the decrease in brightness is low enough to be compatible with that of a planet passing in front of the stellar disk. To eliminate these cases, one performs observations from the ground using two methods: radial velocity spectroscopy and imaging photometry with a CCD camera. In the first case, the mass of the binary stars is immediately detected and in the second case one can expect to identify in the field the binary system near the target star responsible for the alert: the relative decline of brightness will be greater than the one seen by CoRoT which adds all the light in the mask defining the field of measurement. In consequence, the CoRoT exoplanet science team has decided to publish confirmed and fully characterized planets only and not simple candidate lists. This strategy, different from the one pursued by the Kepler mission, where the candidates are regularly updated and made available to the public, is quite lengthy. On the other hand, the approach also increases the scientific return of the mission, as the set of published CoRoT discoveries constitute some of the best exoplanetary studies carried out so far.

====Timeline of planetary discoveries====

CoRoT discovered its first two planets in 2007: the hot Jupiters CoRoT-1b and CoRoT-2b. Results on asteroseismology were published in the same year.

In May 2008, two new exoplanets of Jupiter size, CoRoT-4b and CoRoT-5b, as well as an unknown massive celestial object, CoRoT-3b, were announced by ESA.

In February 2009, during the First CoRoT Symposium, the super-Earth CoRoT-7b was announced, which at the time was the smallest exoplanet to have its diameter confirmed, at 1.58 Earth diameters. The discoveries of a second non-transiting planet in the same system, CoRoT-7c, and of a new Hot Jupiter, CoRoT-6b, were also announced at the Symposium.

In March 2010 CoRoT-9b was announced. It&#x27;s a long period planet (95.3 days) in an orbit close to that of Mercury.

In June 2010 the CoRoT team announced six new planets, CoRoT-8b, CoRoT-10b, CoRoT-11b, CoRoT-12b, CoRoT-13b, CoRoT-14b, and a brown dwarf, CoRoT-15b. All the planets announced are Jupiter sized, except CoRoT-8b, which appears to be somewhat between Saturn and Neptune. The probe was also able to tentatively detect the reflected light at optical wavelengths of HD46375 b, a non-transiting planet.

In June 2011, during the Second CoRoT Symposium, the probe added ten new objects to the Exoplanet catalogue: CoRoT-16b, CoRoT-17b, CoRoT-18b, CoRoT-19b, CoRoT-20b, CoRoT-21b, CoRoT-22b, CoRoT-23b, CoRoT-24b, CoRoT-24c.

As of November 2011, around 600 additional candidate exoplanets are being screened for confirmation.

==== Main results ====

Among the exoplanets CoRoT detected, one can highlight a subset with the most original features :
* CoRot-1b, the first planet detected by CoRoT is a hot Jupiter. By further analysis, CoRoT-1b became the first exoplanets to have its secondary eclipse detected in the optical, thanks to the high precision lightcurve delivered by CoRoT.
* CoRoT-3b, with a mass of 22 MJup, it appears to be &quot;something between a brown dwarf and a planet.&quot; According to the definition of planet proposed by the owners of the exoplanet.eu database three years later, CoRoT-3b, being less massive than 25 Jupiter masses, is classified as an exoplanet. In an August 2010 paper, CoRoT detected the ellipsoidal and the relativistic beaming effects in the CoRoT-3 lightcurve.
* CoRot-7b, with a radius of 1.7 REarth and a mass of 7.3 MEarth, was the first confirmed rocky planet, with a density and composition which are close to those of the Earth. Its orbital period (i.e. its local year) is very short since it lasts just 20.5 h; because the planet is very close to its star (an almost solar type star), its orbit is a mere 6 stellar radii. As the planet must be in synchronous rotation with its orbital motion because of the huge tidal forces it undergoes, it always presents the same hemisphere to the star: as a consequence, the two hemispheres, the enlightened and the dark, exhibit an extreme contrast in temperature (2200K vs 50K) and a huge ocean of lava must occupy a large part of the hot side. A continent of water and nitrogen dioxide ices is probably occupying the dark side. CoRoT-7b was also the first case of a system discovered by CoRoT, with two super-Earths, one in transit the other not; radial velocity measurements have indeed led to the discovery of CoRoT-7c, a planet of 8.4 MEarth and a period of 3.79 days. A third planet is even suspected.
* CoRoT-8b, a planet of the same class as Neptune, with a mass of 0.22 MJup;
* CoRoT-9b, the first planet that has earned the epithet of a temperate planet. With 80% of Jupiter mass, and an orbit similar to the Mercury one, this is the first transiting temperate planet found known to be similar to those within the Solar System. At the time of the discovery, it was the second longest period exoplanet found in transit, after HD80606 b.
* CoRoT-11b and CoRoT-2b, two inflated planets, with radius 1.4 and 1.5 RJup respectively: the theory does not yet provide a consistent model for such objects;
* CoRoT-15b, a bona fide brown dwarf in orbit;
* CoRoT-10b, CoRoT-16b, CoRoT-20b, CoRoT-23b, four hot Jupiters which are on an eccentric orbits, despite circularization is theoretically predicted for such small orbits: this is a clear constraint on Qp, the parameter that quantifies the energy dissipation by tidal forces;
* CoRoT-22b, notable for its small size, having less than half the mass of Saturn.
* CoRoT-24b and c, the second planetary system discovered by CoRoT, with two small planets of 0.10 and 0.17 MJup. The two planets are of Neptune size, and orbit the same star and represent the first multiple &quot;transiting&quot; system detected by CoRoT.

====List of exoplanets discovered====
The following transiting planets have been announced by the mission.

&quot;Light green rows indicate that the planet orbits one of the stars in a binary star system.&quot;
====Other discoveries====
The following table illustrates brown dwarfs detected by CoRoT as well as non-transiting planets detected in the follow-up program:
==== Global properties of the exoplanets discovered by CoRoT ====
 All CoRoT planets were detected during long runs &quot;i.e.&quot; of at least 70 days. The &quot;detection team &quot; found on average between 200 and 300 cases of periodic events for each run, corresponding to 2–3% of the stars monitored. Of these, only 530 in total were selected as candidate planets (223 in the direction of the galactic anti-center and 307 towards the center). Only 30 of them were finally found to be true planets, &quot;i.e.&quot; about 6%, other cases being eclipsing binaries ( 46%) or unresolved cases (48%).

 The detection capabilities of Corot are illustrated by the figure D showing the depth of the transits measured for all candidates, depending on the period and the brightness of the star: there is indeed a better ability to detect small planets (up to 1.5 R Earth ) for short periods (less than 5 days) and bright stars.

The CoRoT planets cover the wide range of properties and features found in the disparate family of exoplanets: for instance, the masses of CoRoT planets cover a range of almost four orders of magnitude, as shown on Figure.

Tracing the mass of the planet versus the mass of the star (Figure), one finds that the CoRoT data set, with its lower scatter than other experiments, indicates a clear trend that massive planets tend to orbit massive stars, which is consistent with the most commonly accepted models of planetary formation.

<doc id="208697" wikidata="Q1756412" url="?curid=208697" title="Social credit">
<text>Social credit is a distributive philosophy of political economy developed in the 1920s and 1930s by C. H. Douglas. Douglas attributed economic downturns to discrepancies between the cost of goods and the compensation of the workers who made them. To combat what he saw as a chronic deficiency of purchasing power in the economy, Douglas prescribed government intervention in the form of the issuance of debt-free money directly to consumers or producers (if they sold their product below cost to consumers) in order to combat such discrepancy.

In defence of his ideas, Douglas wrote that &quot;Systems were made for men, and not men for systems, and the interest of man which is self-development, is above all systems, whether theological, political or economic.&quot; Douglas said that Social Crediters want to build a new civilization based upon &quot;absolute economic security&quot; for the individual, where &quot;they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid.&quot; In his words, &quot;what we really demand of existence is not that we shall be put into somebody else&#x27;s Utopia, but we shall be put in a position to construct a Utopia of our own.&quot;

The idea of social credit attracted considerable interest in the interwar period, with the Alberta Social Credit Party briefly distributing &quot;prosperity certificates&quot; to the Albertan populace. However, Douglas opposed the distribution of prosperity certificates which were based upon the theories of Silvio Gesell. Douglas&#x27; theory of social credit has been disputed and rejected by most economists and bankers. Prominent economist John Maynard Keynes references Douglas&#x27;s ideas in his book &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot;, but instead poses the principle of effective demand to explain differences in output and consumption.

==Economic theory==

===Factors of production and value===
Douglas disagreed with classical economists who recognised only three factors of production: land, labour and capital. While Douglas did not deny the role of these factors in production, he considered the &quot;cultural inheritance of society&quot; as the primary factor. He defined cultural inheritance as the knowledge, techniques and processes that have accrued to us incrementally from the origins of civilization (i.e. progress). Consequently, mankind does not have to keep &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot;. &quot;We are merely the administrators of that cultural inheritance, and to that extent the cultural inheritance is the property of all of us, without exception.&quot; Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Karl Marx claimed that labour creates all value. While Douglas did not deny that all costs ultimately relate to labour charges of some sort (past or present), he denied that the present labour of the world creates all wealth. Douglas carefully distinguished between value, costs and prices. He claimed that one of the factors resulting in a misdirection of thought in terms of the nature and function of money was economists&#x27; near-obsession about values and their relation to prices and incomes. While Douglas recognized &quot;value in use&quot; as a legitimate theory of values, he also considered values as subjective and not capable of being measured in an objective manner. Thus he rejected the idea of the role of money as a standard, or measure, of value. Douglas believed that money should act as a medium of communication by which consumers direct the distribution of production.

===Economic sabotage===
Closely associated with the concept of cultural inheritance as a factor of production is the social credit theory of economic sabotage. While Douglas believed the cultural heritage factor of production is primary in increasing wealth, he also believed that economic sabotage is the primary factor decreasing it. The word wealth derives from the Old English word , or &quot;well-being&quot;, and Douglas believed that all production should increase personal well-being. Therefore, production that does not directly increase personal well-being is waste, or economic sabotage.
The economic effect of charging all the waste in industry to the consumer so curtails his purchasing power that an increasing percentage of the product of industry must be exported. The effect of this on the worker is that he has to do many times the amount of work which should be necessary to keep him in the highest standard of living, as a result of an artificial inducement to produce things he does not want, which he cannot buy, and which are of no use to the attainment of his internal standard of well-being.
By modern methods of accounting, the consumer is forced to pay for all the costs of production, including waste. The economic effect of charging the consumer with all waste in industry is that the consumer is forced to do much more work than is necessary. Douglas believed that wasted effort could be directly linked to confusion in regard to the purpose of the economic system, and the belief that the economic system exists to provide employment in order to distribute goods and services.
But it may be advisable to glance at some of the proximate causes operating to reduce the return for effort; and to realise the origin of most of the specific instances, it must be borne in mind that the existing economic system distributes goods and services through the same agency which induces goods and services, i.e., payment for work in progress. In other words, if production stops, distribution stops, and, as a consequence, a clear incentive exists to produce useless or superfluous articles in order that useful commodities already existing may be distributed. This perfectly simple reason is the explanation of the increasing necessity of what has come to be called economic sabotage; the colossal waste of effort which goes on in every walk of life quite unobserved by the majority of people because they are so familiar with it; a waste which yet so over-taxed the ingenuity of society to extend it that the climax of war only occurred in the moment when a culminating exhibition of organised sabotage was necessary to preserve the system from spontaneous combustion.
===Purpose of an economy===
Douglas claimed there were three possible policy alternatives with respect to the economic system:
1. The first of these is that it is a disguised Government, of which the primary, though admittedly not the only, object is to impose upon the world a system of thought and action.

2. The second alternative has a certain similarity to the first, but is simpler. It assumes that the primary objective of the industrial system is the provision of employment.

3. And the third, which is essentially simpler still, in fact, so simple that it appears entirely unintelligible to the majority, is that the object of the industrial system is merely to provide goods and services.
Douglas believed that it was the third policy alternative upon which an economic system should be based, but confusion of thought has allowed the industrial system to be governed by the first two objectives. If the purpose of our economic system is to deliver the maximum amount of goods and services with the least amount of effort, then the ability to deliver goods and services with the least amount of employment is actually desirable. Douglas proposed that unemployment is a logical consequence of machines replacing labour in the productive process, and any attempt to reverse this process through policies designed to attain full employment directly sabotages our cultural inheritance. Douglas also believed that the people displaced from the industrial system through the process of mechanization should still have the ability to consume the fruits of the system, because he suggested that we are all inheritors of the cultural inheritance, and his proposal for a national dividend is directly related to this belief.

===The creditary nature of money===
Douglas criticized classical economics because many of the theories are based upon a barter economy, whereas the modern economy is a monetary one. Initially, money originated from the productive system, when cattle owners punched leather discs which represented a head of cattle. These discs could then be exchanged for corn, and the corn producers could then exchange the disc for a head of cattle at a later date. The word &quot;pecuniary&quot; comes from the Latin , originally and literally meaning &quot;cattle&quot; (related to , meaning &quot;beast&quot;). Today, the productive system and the monetary system are two separate entities. Douglas demonstrated that loans create deposits, and presented mathematical proof in his book &quot;Social Credit.&quot; Bank credit comprises the vast majority of money, and is created every time a bank makes a loan. Douglas was also one of the first to understand the creditary nature of money. The word credit derives from the Latin , meaning &quot;to believe&quot;. &quot;The essential quality of money, therefore, is that a man shall believe that he can get what he wants by the aid of it.&quot;

According to economists, money is a medium of exchange. Douglas argued that this may have once been the case when the majority of wealth was produced by individuals who subsequently exchanged it with each other. But in modern economies, division of labour splits production into multiple processes, and wealth is produced by people working in association with each other. For instance, an automobile worker does not produce any wealth (i.e., the automobile) by himself, but only in conjunction with other auto workers, the producers of roads, gasoline, insurance, etc.

In this opinion, wealth is a pool upon which people can draw, and money becomes a ticketing system. The efficiency gained by individuals cooperating in the productive process was named by Douglas as the &quot;unearned increment of association&quot; – historic accumulations of which constitute what Douglas called the cultural heritage. The means of drawing upon this pool is money distributed by the banking system.

Douglas believed that money should not be regarded as a commodity but rather as a ticket, a means of distribution of production. &quot;There are two sides to this question of a ticket representing something that we can call, if we like, a value. There is the ticket itself – the money which forms the thing we call &#x27;effective demand&#x27; – and there is something we call a price opposite to it.&quot; Money is effective demand, and the means of reclaiming that money are prices and taxes. As real capital replaces labour in the process of modernization, money should become increasingly an instrument of distribution. The idea that money is a medium of exchange is related to the belief that all wealth is created by the current labour of the world, and Douglas clearly rejected this belief, stating that the cultural inheritance of society is the primary factor in the creation of wealth, which makes money a distribution mechanism, not a medium of exchange.

Douglas also claimed the problem of production, or scarcity, had long been solved. The new problem was one of distribution. However, so long as orthodox economics makes scarcity a value, banks will continue to believe that they are creating value for the money they produce by making it scarce. Douglas criticized the banking system on two counts:
# for being a form of government which has been centralizing its power for centuries, and
# for claiming ownership of the money they create.
The former Douglas identified as being anti-social in policy. The latter he claimed was equivalent to claiming ownership of the nation. According to Douglas, money is merely an abstract representation of the real credit of the community, which is the ability of the community to deliver goods and services, when and where they are required.

==The A + B theorem==

In January 1919, &quot;A Mechanical View of Economics&quot; by C. H. Douglas was the first article to be published in the magazine &quot;New Age&quot;, edited by Alfred Richard Orage, critiquing the methods by which economic activity is typically measured:
It is not the purpose of this short article to depreciate the services of accountants; in fact, under the existing conditions probably no body of men has done more to crystallise the data on which we carry on the business of the world; but the utter confusion of thought which has undoubtedly arisen from the calm assumption of the book-keeper and the accountant that he and he alone was in a position to assign positive or negative values to the quantities represented by his figures is one of the outstanding curiosities of the industrial system; and the attempt to mould the activities of a great empire on such a basis is surely the final condemnation of an out-worn method.
In 1920, Douglas presented the A + B theorem in his book, &quot;Credit-Power and Democracy&quot;, in critique of accounting methodology pertinent to income and prices. In the fourth, Australian Edition of 1933, Douglas states:
A factory or other productive organization has, besides its economic function as a producer of goods, a financial aspect – it may be regarded on the one hand as a device for the distribution of purchasing-power to individuals through the media of wages, salaries, and dividends; and on the other hand as a manufactory of prices – financial values. From this standpoint, its payments may be divided into two groups:

:Group A: &quot;All payments made to individuals (wages, salaries, and dividends).&quot;

:Group B: &quot;All payments made to other organizations (raw materials, bank charges, and other external costs).&quot;

Now the rate of flow of purchasing-power to individuals is represented by A, but since all payments go into prices, the rate of flow of prices cannot be less than A+B. The product of any factory may be considered as something which the public ought to be able to buy, although in many cases it is an intermediate product of no use to individuals but only to a subsequent manufacture; but since A will not purchase A+B; a proportion of the product at least equivalent to B must be distributed by a form of purchasing-power which is not comprised in the description grouped under A. It will be necessary at a later stage to show that this additional purchasing power is provided by loan credit (bank overdrafts) or export credit.
Beyond empirical evidence, Douglas claims this deductive theorem demonstrates that total prices increase faster than total incomes when regarded as a flow.

In his pamphlet entitled &quot;The New and the Old Economics&quot;, Douglas describes the cause of &quot;B&quot; payments:
I think that a little consideration will make it clear that in this sense an overhead charge is any charge in respect of which the actual distributed purchasing power does not still exist, and that practically this means any charge created at a further distance in the past than the period of cyclic rate of circulation of money. There is no fundamental difference between tools and intermediate products, and the latter may therefore be included.
In 1932, Douglas estimated the cyclic rate of circulation of money to be approximately three weeks. The cyclic rate of circulation of money measures the amount of time required for a loan to pass through the productive system and return to the bank. This can be calculated by determining the amount of clearings through the bank in a year divided by the average amount of deposits held at the banks (which varies very little). The result is the number of times money must turnover in order to produce these clearing house figures. In a testimony before the Alberta Agricultural Committee of the Alberta Legislature in 1934, Douglas said:
Now we know there are an increasing number of charges which originated from a period much anterior to three weeks, and included in those charges, as a matter of fact, are most of the charges made in, respect of purchases from one organization to another, but all such charges as capital charges (for instance, on a railway which was constructed a year, two years, three years, five or ten years ago, where charges are still extant), cannot be liquidated by a stream of purchasing power which does not increase in volume and which has a period of three weeks. The consequence is, you have a piling up of debt, you have in many cases a diminution of purchasing power being equivalent to the price of the goods for sale.
According to Douglas, the major consequence of the problem he identified in his A+B theorem is exponentially increasing debt. Further, he believed that society is forced to produce goods that consumers either do not want or cannot afford to purchase. The latter represents a favorable balance of trade, meaning a country exports more than it imports. But not every country can pursue this objective at the same time, as one country must import more than it exports when another country exports more than it imports. Douglas proposed that the long-term consequence of this policy is a trade war, typically resulting in real war – hence, the social credit admonition, &quot;He who calls for Full-Employment calls for War!&quot;, expressed by the Social Credit Party of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, led by John Hargrave. The former represents excessive capital production and/or military build-up. Military buildup necessitates either the violent use of weapons or a superfluous accumulation of them. Douglas believed that excessive capital production is only a temporary correction, because the cost of the capital appears in the cost of consumer goods, or taxes, which will further exacerbate future gaps between income and prices.
In the first place, these capital goods have to be sold to someone. They form a reservoir of forced exports. They must, as intermediate products, enter somehow into the price of subsequent ultimate products and they produce a position of most unstable equilibrium, since the life of capital goods is in general longer than that of consumable goods, or ultimate products, and yet in order to meet the requirements for money to buy the consumable goods, the rate of production of capital goods must be continuously increased.
===The A + B theorem and a cost accounting view of inflation===
The replacement of labour by capital in the productive process implies that overhead charges (B) increase in relation to income (A), because &quot;&#x27;B&#x27; is the financial representation of the lever of capital&quot;. As Douglas stated in his first article, &quot;The Delusion of Superproduction&quot;:
The factory cost – not the selling price – of any article under our present industrial and financial system is made up of three main divisions-direct labor cost, material cost and overhead charges, the ratio of which varies widely, with the &quot;modernity&quot; of the method of production. For instance, a sculptor producing a work of art with the aid of simple tools and a block of marble has next to no overhead charges, but a very low rate of production, while a modern screw-making plant using automatic machines may have very high overhead charges and very low direct labour cost, or high rates of production.

Since increased industrial output per individual depends mainly on tools and method, it may almost be stated as a law that intensified production means a progressively higher ratio of overhead charges to direct labour cost, and, apart from artificial reasons, this is simply an indication of the extent to which machinery replaces manual labour, as it should.
If overhead charges are constantly increasing relative to income, any attempt to stabilize or increase income results in increasing prices. If income is constant or increasing, and overhead charges are continuously increasing due to technological advancement, then prices, which equal income plus overhead charges, must also increase. Further, any attempt to stabilize or decrease prices must be met by decreasing incomes according to this analysis. As the Phillips Curve demonstrates, inflation and unemployment are trade-offs, unless prices are reduced from monies derived from outside the productive system. According to Douglas&#x27;s A+B theorem, the systemic problem of increasing prices, or inflation, is not &quot;too much money chasing too few goods&quot;, but is the increasing rate of overhead charges in production due to the replacement of labour by capital in industry combined with a policy of full employment. Douglas did not suggest that inflation cannot be caused by too much money chasing too few consumer goods, but according to his analysis this is not the only cause of inflation, and inflation is systemic according to the rules of cost accountancy given overhead charges are constantly increasing relative to income. In other words, inflation can exist even if consumers have insufficient purchasing power to buy back all of production. Douglas claimed that there were two limits which governed prices, a lower limit governed by the cost of production, and an upper limit governed by what an article will fetch on the open market. Douglas suggested that this is the reason why deflation is regarded as a problem in orthodox economics because bankers and businessmen were very apt to forget the lower limit of prices.

===Compensated price and national dividend===
Douglas proposed to eliminate the gap between purchasing power and prices by increasing consumer purchasing power with credits which do not appear in prices in the form of a price rebate and a dividend. Formally called a &quot;Compensated Price&quot; and a &quot;National (or Consumer) Dividend&quot;, a National Credit Office would be charged with the task of calculating the size of the rebate and dividend by determining a national balance sheet, and calculating aggregate production and consumption statistics.

The price rebate is based upon the observation that the real cost of production is the mean rate of consumption over the mean rate of production for an equivalent period of time.

: formula_1

where

* &quot;M&quot; = money distributed for a given programme of production,
* &quot;C&quot; = consumption,
* &quot;P&quot; = production.

The physical cost of producing something is the materials and capital that were consumed in its production, plus that amount of consumer goods labour consumed during its production. This total consumption represents the physical, or real, cost of production.

: formula_2

where
* Consumption = cost of consumer goods,
* Depreciation = depreciation of real capital,
* Credit = Credit Created,
* Production = cost of total production

Since fewer inputs are consumed to produce a unit of output with every improvement in process, the real cost of production falls over time. As a result, prices should also decrease with the progression of time. &quot;As society&#x27;s capacity to deliver goods and services is increased by the use of plant and still more by scientific progress, and decreased by the production, maintenance, or depreciation of it, we can issue credit, in costs, at a greater rate than the rate at which we take it back through prices of ultimate products, if capacity to supply individuals exceeds desire.&quot;

Based on his conclusion that the real cost of production is less than the financial cost of production, the Douglas price rebate (Compensated Price) is determined by the ratio of consumption to production. Since consumption over a period of time is typically less than production over the same period of time in any industrial society, the real cost of goods should be less than the financial cost.

For example, if the money cost of a good is $100, and the ratio of consumption to production is 3/4, then the real cost of the good is $100(3/4) = $75. As a result, if a consumer spent $100 for a good, the National Credit Authority would rebate the consumer $25. The good costs the consumer $75, the retailer receives $100, and the consumer receives the difference of $25 via new credits created by the National Credit Authority.

The National Dividend is justified by the displacement of labour in the productive process due to technological increases in productivity. As human labour is increasingly replaced by machines in the productive process, Douglas believed people should be free to consume while enjoying increasing amounts of leisure, and that the Dividend would provide this freedom.

===Critics of the A + B theorem and rebuttal===
Critics of the theorem, such as J. M. Pullen, Hawtrey and J. M. Keynes argue there is no difference between A and B payments. Other critics, such as Gary North, argue that social credit policies are inflationary. &quot;The A + B theorem has met with almost universal rejection from academic economists on the grounds that, although B payments may be made initially to &quot;other organizations,&quot; they will not necessarily be lost to the flow of available purchasing power. A and B payments overlap through time. Even if the B payments are received and spent before the finished product is available for purchase, current purchasing power will be boosted by B payments received in the current production of goods that will be available for purchase in the future.&quot;

A. W. Joseph replied to this specific criticism in a paper given to the Birmingham Actuarial Society, &quot;Banking and Industry&quot;:
Let A1+B1 be the costs in a period to time of articles produced by factories making consumable goods divided up into A1 costs which refer to money paid to individuals by means of salaries, wages, dividends, etc., and B1 costs which refer to money paid to other institutions. Let A2, B2 be the corresponding costs of factories producing capital equipment. The money distributed to individuals is A1+A2 and the cost of the final consumable goods is A1+B1. If money in the hands of the public is to be equal to the costs of consumable articles produced then A1+A2 = A1+B1 and therefore A2=B1. Now modern science has brought us to the stage where machines are more and more taking the place of human labour in producing goods, i.e. A1 is becoming less important relatively to B1 and A2 less important relatively to B2.
In symbols if B1/A1 = k1 and B2/A2 = k2 both k1 and k2 are increasing.

Since A2=B1 this means that (A2+B2)/(A1+B1)= (1+k2)*A2/(1+1/k1)*B1 = (1+k2)/(1+1/k1) which is increasing.
Thus in order that the economic system should keep working it is essential that capital goods should be produced in ever increasing quantity relatively to consumable goods. As soon as the ratio of capital goods to consumable goods slackens, costs exceed money distributed, i.e. the consumer is unable to purchase the consumable goods coming on the market.&quot;
And in a reply to Dr. Hobson, Douglas restated his central thesis: &quot;To reiterate categorically, the theorem criticised by Mr. Hobson: the wages, salaries and dividends distributed during a given period do not, and cannot, buy the production of that period; that production can only be bought, i.e., distributed, under present conditions by a draft, and an increasing draft, on the purchasing power distributed in respect of future production, and this latter is mainly and increasingly derived from financial credit created by the banks.&quot;

Incomes are paid to workers during a multi-stage program of production. According to the convention of accepted orthodox rules of accountancy, those incomes are part of the financial cost and price of the final product. For the product to be purchased with incomes earned in respect of its manufacture, all of these incomes would have to be saved until the product&#x27;s completion. Douglas argued that incomes are typically spent on past production to meet the present needs of living, and will not be available to purchase goods completed in the future – goods which must include the sum of incomes paid out during their period of manufacture in their price. Consequently, this does not liquidate the financial cost of production inasmuch as it merely passes charges of one accountancy period on as mounting charges against future periods. In other words, according to Douglas, supply does not create enough demand to liquidate all the costs of production. Douglas denied the validity of Say&#x27;s law in economics.

While John Maynard Keynes referred to Douglas as a &quot;private, perhaps, but not a major in the brave army of heretics&quot;, he did state that Douglas &quot;is entitled to claim, as against some of his orthodox adversaries, that he at least has not been wholly oblivious of the outstanding problem of our economic system&quot;. While Keynes said that Douglas&#x27;s A+B theorem &quot;includes much mere mystification&quot;, he reaches a similar conclusion to Douglas when he states:
Thus the problem of providing that new capital-investment shall always outrun capital-disinvestment sufficiently to fill the gap between net income and consumption, presents a problem which is increasingly difficult as capital increases. New capital-investment can only take place in excess of current capital-disinvestment if future expenditure on consumption is expected to increase. Each time we secure to-day&#x27;s equilibrium by increased investment we are aggravating the difficulty of securing equilibrium to-morrow.
The criticism that social credit policies are inflationary is based upon what economists call the quantity theory of money, which states that the quantity of money multiplied by its velocity of circulation equals total purchasing power. Douglas was quite critical of this theory stating, &quot;The velocity of the circulation of money in the ordinary sense of the phrase, is – if I may put it that way – a complete myth. No additional purchasing power at all is created by the velocity of the circulation of money. The rate of transfer from hand-to-hand, as you might say, of goods is increased, of course, by the rate of spending, but no more costs can be canceled by one unit of purchasing power than one unit of cost. Every time a unit of purchasing power passes through the costing system it creates a cost, and when it comes back again to the same costing system by the buying and transfer of the unit of production to the consuming system it may be cancelled, but that process is quite irrespective of what is called the velocity of money, so the categorical answer is that I do not take any account of the velocity of money in that sense.&quot; The Alberta Social Credit government published in a committee report what was perceived as an error in regards to this theory: &quot;The fallacy in the theory lies in the incorrect assumption that money &#x27;circulates&#x27;, whereas it is issued against production, and withdrawn as purchasing power as the goods are bought for consumption.&quot;

Other critics argue that if the gap between income and prices exists as Douglas claimed, the economy would have collapsed in short order. They also argue that there are periods of time in which purchasing power is in excess of the price of consumer goods for sale.

Douglas replied to these criticisms in his testimony before the Alberta Agricultural Committee:
What people who say that forget is that we were piling up debt at that time at the rate of ten millions sterling a day and if it can be shown, and it can be shown, that we are increasing debt continuously by normal operation of the banking system and the financial system at the present time, then that is proof that we are not distributing purchasing power sufficient to buy the goods for sale at that time; otherwise we should not be increasing debt, and that is the situation.
==Political theory==
C.H. Douglas defined democracy as the &quot;will of the people&quot;, not rule by the majority, suggesting that social credit could be implemented by any political party supported by effective public demand. Once implemented to achieve a realistic integration of means and ends, party politics would cease to exist. Traditional ballot box democracy is incompatible with Social Credit, which assumes the right of individuals to choose freely one choice at a time, and to contract out of unsatisfactory associations. Douglas advocated what he called the &quot;responsible vote&quot;, where anonymity in the voting process would no longer exist. &quot;The individual voter must be made individually responsible, not collectively taxable, for his vote.&quot; Douglas believed that party politics should be replaced by a &quot;union of electors&quot; in which the only role of an elected official would be to implement the popular will. Douglas believed that the implementation of such a system was necessary as otherwise the government would be controlled by international financiers. Douglas also opposed the secret ballot arguing that it resulted in electoral irresponsibility, calling it a &quot;Jewish&quot; technique used to ensure Barabbas was freed leaving Christ to be crucified.

Douglas considered the constitution an organism, not an organization. In this view, establishing the supremacy of common law is essential to ensure protection of individual rights from an all-powerful parliament. Douglas also believed the effectiveness of British government is determined structurally by application of a Christian concept known as Trinitarianism: &quot;In some form or other, sovereignty in the British Isles for the last two thousand years has been Trinitarian. Whether we look on this Trinitarianism under the names of King, Lords and Commons or as Policy, Sanctions and Administration, the Trinity-in-Unity has existed, and our national success has been greatest when the balance (never perfect) has been approached.&quot;

Opposing the formation of Social Credit parties, C.H. Douglas believed a group of elected amateurs should never direct a group of competent experts in technical matters. While experts are ultimately responsible for achieving results, the goal of politicians should be to pressure those experts to deliver policy results desired by the populace. According to Douglas, &quot;the proper function of Parliament is to force all activities of a public nature to be carried on so that the individuals who comprise the public may derive the maximum benefit from them. Once the idea is grasped, the criminal absurdity of the party system becomes evident.&quot;

==History==
C. H. Douglas was a civil engineer who pursued his higher education at Cambridge University. His early writings appeared most notably in the British intellectual journal &quot;The New Age&quot;. The editor of that publication, Alfred Orage, devoted the magazines &quot;The New Age&quot; and later &quot;The New English Weekly&quot; to the promulgation of Douglas&#x27;s ideas until his death on the eve of his BBC speech on social credit, 5 November 1934, in the &quot;Poverty in Plenty&quot; Series.

Douglas&#x27;s first book, &quot;Economic Democracy&quot;, was published in 1920, soon after his article &quot;The Delusion of Super-Production&quot; appeared in 1918 in the &quot;English Review&quot;. Among Douglas&#x27;s other early works were &quot;The Control and Distribution of Production&quot;, &quot;Credit-Power and Democracy&quot;, &quot;Warning Democracy&quot; and &quot;The Monopoly of Credit&quot;. Of considerable interest is the evidence he presented to the Canadian House of Commons Select Committee on Banking and Commerce in 1923, to the British parliamentary Macmillan Committee on Finance and Industry in 1930, which included exchanges with economist John Maynard Keynes, and to the Agricultural Committee of the Alberta Legislature in 1934 during the term of the United Farmers of Alberta Government in that Canadian province.

The writings of C. H. Douglas spawned a worldwide movement, most prominent in the British Commonwealth, with a presence in Europe and activities in the United States where Orage, during his sojourn there, promoted Douglas&#x27;s ideas. In the United States, the New Democracy group was directed by the American author Gorham Munson who contributed a major book on social credit titled &quot;Aladdin’s Lamp: The Wealth of the American People&quot;. While Canada and New Zealand had electoral successes with &quot;social credit&quot; political parties, the efforts in England and Australia were devoted primarily to pressuring existing parties to implement social credit. This function was performed especially by Douglas&#x27;s social credit secretariat in England and the Commonwealth Leagues of Rights in Australia. Douglas continued writing and contributing to the secretariat&#x27;s journals, initially &quot;Social Credit&quot; and soon thereafter &quot;The Social Crediter&quot; (which continues to be published by the Secretariat) for the remainder of his lifetime, concentrating more on political and philosophical issues during his later years.

=== Origins ===
It was while he was reorganising the work at Farnborough, during World War I, that Douglas noticed that the weekly total costs of goods produced was greater than the sums paid to individuals for wages, salaries and dividends. This seemed to contradict the theory of classic Ricardian economics, that all costs are distributed simultaneously as purchasing power. Troubled by the seeming difference between the way money flowed and the objectives of industry (&quot;delivery of goods and services&quot;, in his opinion), Douglas decided to apply engineering methods to the economic system.

Douglas collected data from more than a hundred large British businesses and found that in nearly every case, except that of companies becoming bankrupt, the sums paid out in salaries, wages and dividends were always less than the total costs of goods and services produced each week: consumers did not have enough income to buy back what they had made. He published his observations and conclusions in an article in the magazine &quot;The English Review&quot;, where he suggested: &quot;That we are living under a system of accountancy which renders the delivery of the nation&#x27;s goods and services to itself a technical impossibility.&quot; He later formalized this observation in his A+B theorem. Douglas proposed to eliminate this difference between total prices and total incomes by augmenting consumers&#x27; purchasing power through a National Dividend and a Compensated Price Mechanism.

According to Douglas, the true purpose of production is consumption, and production must serve the genuine, freely expressed interests of consumers. In order to accomplish this objective, he believed that each citizen should have a beneficial, not direct, inheritance in the communal capital conferred by complete access to consumer goods assured by the National Dividend and Compensated Price. Douglas thought that consumers, fully provided with adequate purchasing power, will establish the policy of production through exercise of their monetary vote. In this view, the term economic democracy does not mean worker control of industry, but democratic control of credit. Removing the policy of production from banking institutions, government, and industry, social credit envisages an &quot;aristocracy of producers, serving and accredited by a democracy of consumers&quot;.

===Political history===
During early years of the philosophy, the management of the British Labour Party resisted pressure from some trade unionists to implement social credit, as hierarchical views of Fabian socialism, economic growth and full employment, were incompatible with the National Dividend and abolition of wage slavery suggested by Douglas. In an effort to discredit the social credit movement, one leading Fabian, Sidney Webb, is said to have declared that he did not care whether Douglas was technically correct or not – he simply did not like his policy. In the Irish Free State promoted by Maud Gonne, and subsequently by Denis Ireland, Douglas&#x27;s ideas briefly spawned the Irish Social Credit Party. Confused in the public mind with the Communist Party of Ireland, its meetings were attacked.

==== Aberhart administration ====
In 1935, the world&#x27;s first Social Credit government was elected in Alberta, Canada led by William Aberhart. A book by Maurice Colbourne, entitled &quot;The Meaning of Social Credit&quot;, had convinced Aberhart that the theories of Major Douglas would facilitate for Alberta&#x27;s recovery from the Great Depression. Aberhart added a heavy dose of fundamentalist Christianity to Douglas&#x27; theories, and the Canadian social credit movement, which was largely nurtured in Alberta, thus acquired a strong social conservative influence. However, some historians believe that neither Aberhart nor his supporters understood the works of Douglas, and simply rallied around Aberhart&#x27;s charisma.

Douglas was consulted by the 1921–1935 United Farmers of Alberta provincial government in Alberta, but the UFA saw only difficulties in trying to bring in Social Credit. Douglas became an advisor to Aberhart, but withdrew after a short time and never visited Alberta after 1935 due to strategic differences. Aberhart sought orthodox counsel with respect to the Province&#x27;s finances, and the correspondence between them was published by Douglas in his book, &quot;The Alberta Experiment&quot;.

While Aberhart, the Premier, wanted to balance the provincial budget, Douglas argued the concept of a &quot;balanced budget&quot; was inconsistent with Social Credit principles. Douglas stated that, under existing rules of financial cost accountancy, balancing all budgets within an economy simultaneously is an arithmetic impossibility. In a letter to Aberhart, Douglas stated:
This seems to be a suitable occasion on which to emphasise the proposition that a Balanced Budget is quite inconsistent with the use of Social Credit (i.e., Real Credit – the ability to deliver goods and services &#x27;as, when and where required&#x27;) in the modern world, and is simply a statement in accounting figures that the progress of the country is stationary, i.e., that it consumes exactly what it produces, including capital assets. The result of the acceptance of this proposition is that all capital appreciation becomes quite automatically the property of those who create and issue of money [i.e., the banking system] and the necessary unbalancing of the Budget is covered by Debts.
Douglas sent two social credit technical advisors from the United Kingdom, L. Denis Byrne and George F. Powell, to Alberta. But early attempts to pass social credit legislation were ruled by the Privy Council in London.Drawing on the monetary theories of Silvio Gesell, William Aberhart issued a currency substitute known as prosperity certificates. These scrips intentionally depreciated in value the longer they were held, and Douglas openly criticized the idea:
Gesell&#x27;s theory was that the trouble with the world was that people saved money so that what you had to do was to make them spend it faster. Disappearing money is the heaviest form of continuous taxation ever devised. The theory behind this idea of Gesell&#x27;s was that what is required is to stimulate trade – that you have to get people frantically buying goods – a perfectly sound idea so long as the objective of life is merely trading.
They did provide spending power to many impoverished Albertans in the time they were in circulation.

Aberhart did bring in a measure of social credit, with the establishment of a government-owned banking system, the Alberta Treasury Branches, still in operation today and now among the very few government-owned banks in North America that serve the public. (See for comparison the Bank of North Dakota.)

In 1938, Aberhart&#x27;s Alberta Social Credit Party had 41,000 paid members, forming a broad coalition ranging from those who believed in Douglas&#x27; monetary policies to moderate socialists. The latter group helped influence the party to form alliances with the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and various communist groups in various local and provincial elections. However, as it became apparent that the party was failing to deliver on its promises to control prices and distribute social dividends, the party&#x27;s membership fell rapidly, totaling just 3,500 by 1942.

==== Later activities ====
Under Ernest Manning, who succeeded Aberhart after his death in 1943, the Alberta Social Credit Party saw a major revival, with a post-war economic boom and high oil revenues helping the party retain power for a quarter of a century. However, the party soon departed from its origins and became popularly identified as a right wing populist party, focusing much of its efforts on combatting Alberta&#x27;s unions, and implementing a red scare. In the Secretariat&#x27;s journal, &quot;An Act for the Better Management of the Credit of Alberta&quot;, Douglas published a critical analysis of the Social Credit movement in Alberta, in which he said, &quot;The Manning administration is no more a Social Credit administration than the British government is Labour&quot;. Manning accused Douglas and his followers of anti-Semitism, and purged &quot;Douglasites&quot; from the Alberta government. The British Columbia Social Credit Party won power in 1952 in the province to Alberta&#x27;s west, but had little in common with Social Credit bank reform, Major Douglas or his theories.

Social credit parties also enjoyed some electoral success at the federal level in Canada. The Social Credit Party of Canada was initiated mostly by Albertans, and eventually created another base of support in Quebec. Social Credit also did well nationally in New Zealand, where it was the country&#x27;s third party for almost 30 years.

==Philosophy==
Douglas described Social Credit as &quot;the policy of a philosophy&quot;, and warned against considering it solely as a scheme for monetary reform. He called this philosophy &quot;practical Christianity&quot; and stated that its central issue is the Incarnation. Douglas believed that there was a Canon which permeated the universe, and Jesus Christ was the Incarnation of this Canon. However, he also believed that Christianity remained ineffective so long as it remained transcendental. Religion, which derives from the Latin word (to &quot;bind back&quot;), was intended to be a binding back to reality. Social Credit is concerned with the incarnation of Christian principles in our organic affairs. Specifically, it is concerned with the principles of association and how to maximize the increments of association which redound to satisfaction of the individual in society – while minimizing any decrements of association.

The goal of Social Credit is to maximize immanent sovereignty. Social credit is consonant with the Christian doctrine of salvation through unearned grace, and is therefore incompatible with any variant of the doctrine of salvation through works. Works need not be of Purity in intent or of desirable consequence and in themselves alone are as &quot;filthy rags&quot;. For instance, the present system makes destructive, obscenely wasteful wars a virtual certainty – which provides much &quot;work&quot; for everyone. Social credit has been called the Third Alternative to the futile Left-Right Duality.

Although Douglas defined social credit as a philosophy with Christian origins, he did not envision a Christian theocracy. Douglas did not believe that religion should be mandated by law or external compulsion. Practical Christian society is Trinitarian in structure, based upon a constitution where the constitution is an organism changing in relation to our knowledge of the nature of the universe. &quot;The progress of human society is best measured by the extent of its creative ability. Imbued with a number of natural gifts, notably reason, memory, understanding and free will, man has learned gradually to master the secrets of nature, and to build for himself a world wherein lie the potentialities of peace, security, liberty and abundance.&quot; Douglas said that social crediters want to build a new civilization based upon absolute economic security for the individual – where &quot;they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid.&quot; In keeping with this goal, Douglas was opposed to all forms of taxation on real property. This set social credit at variance from the land-taxing recommendations of Henry George.

Social credit society recognizes the fact that the relationship between man and God is unique. In this view, it is essential to allow man the greatest possible freedom in order to pursue this relationship. Douglas defined freedom as the ability to choose and refuse one choice at a time, and to contract out of unsatisfactory associations. Douglas believed that if people were given the economic security and leisure achievable in the context of a social credit dispensation, most would end their service to Mammon and use their free time to pursue spiritual, intellectual or cultural goals resulting in self-development. Douglas opposed what he termed &quot;the pyramid of power&quot;. Totalitarianism represents this pyramid and is the antithesis of social credit. It turns the government into an end instead of a means, and the individual into a means instead of an end – – &quot;the Devil is God upside down.&quot; Social credit is designed to give the individual the maximum freedom allowable given the need for association in economic, political and social matters. Social Credit elevates the importance of the individual and holds that all institutions exist to serve the individual – that the State exists to serve its citizens, not that individuals exist to serve the State.

Douglas emphasized that all policy derives from its respective philosophy and that &quot;Society is primarily metaphysical, and must have regard to the organic relationships of its prototype.&quot; Social credit rejects dialectical materialistic philosophy. &quot;The tendency to argue from the particular to the general is a special case of the sequence from materialism to collectivism. If the universe is reduced to molecules, ultimately we can dispense with a catalogue and a dictionary; all things are the same thing, and all words are just sounds – molecules in motion.&quot;

Douglas divided philosophy into two schools of thought that he termed the &quot;classical school&quot; and the &quot;modern school&quot;, which are broadly represented by philosophies of Aristotle and Francis Bacon respectively. Douglas was critical of both schools of thought, but believed that &quot;the truth lies in appreciation of the fact that neither conception is useful without the other&quot;.

===Criticism for antisemitism===
Social crediters and Douglas have been criticized for spreading antisemitism. Douglas was critical of &quot;international Jewry&quot;, especially in his later writings. He asserted that such Jews controlled many of the major banks and were involved in an international conspiracy to centralize the power of finance. Some people have claimed that Douglas was antisemitic because he was quite critical of pre-Christian philosophy. In his book &quot;Social Credit&quot;, he wrote that, &quot;It is not too much to say that one of the root ideas through which Christianity comes into conflict with the conceptions of the Old Testament and the ideals of the pre-Christians&#x27; era is in respect of this dethronement of abstractionism.&quot;

Douglas was opposed to abstractionist philosophies because he believed that these philosophies inevitably resulted in the elevation of abstractions, such as the state, and legal fictions, such as corporate personhood, over the individual. He also believed that what Jews considered as abstractionist thought tended to encourage them to endorse communist ideals and an emphasis on collectives over individuals. Historian John L. Finlay, in his book &quot;Social Credit: The English Origins&quot;, wrote, &quot;Anti-Semitism of the Douglas kind, if it can be called anti-Semitism at all, may be fantastic, may be dangerous even, in that it may be twisted into a dreadful form, but it is not itself vicious nor evil.&quot; In his 1972 book, &quot;Social Credit: The English Origins&quot;, Finlay argues that, &quot;It must also be noted that while Douglas was critical of some aspects of Jewish thought, Douglas did not seek to discriminate against Jews as a people or race. It was never suggested that the National Dividend be withheld from them.&quot;

==Literary figures==
As lack of finance has been a constant impediment to the development of the arts and literature, the concept of economic democracy through social credit had immediate appeal in literary circles. Names associated with social credit include C. M. Grieve, Charlie Chaplin, William Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, J. R. R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, T. S. Eliot, Flannery O&#x27;Connor, Dorothy Day, Thomas Merton, Herbert Read, George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, Ray Bradbury, Denis Ireland, Storm Jameson, Eimar O&#x27;Duffy, Sybil Thorndike, Bonamy Dobrée, Eric de Maré and the American publisher James Laughlin. Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton espoused similar ideas. In 1933 Eimar O&#x27;Duffy published &quot;Asses in Clover&quot;, a science fiction fantasy exploration of social credit themes. His social credit economics book &quot;Life and Money: Being a Critical Examination of the Principles and Practice of Orthodox Economics with A Practical Scheme to End the Muddle it has made of our Civilisation&quot;, was endorsed by Douglas.

Robert A. Heinlein described a social credit economy in his 2003 posthumously published first novel written in 1938, &quot;For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs&quot;, and his 1942 novel &quot;Beyond This Horizon&quot; describes a similar system in less detail. In Heinlein&#x27;s future society, government is not funded by taxation. Instead, government controls the currency and prevents inflation by providing a price rebate to participating business and a guaranteed income to every citizen.

In his novel &quot;The Trick Top Hat&quot;, part of his 1979 &quot;Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat Trilogy&quot;, Robert Anton Wilson described the implementation by the President of an alternate future United States of an altered form of social credit, in which the government issues a National Dividend to all citizens in the form of &quot;trade aids&quot;, which can be spent like money but which cannot be lent at interest (in order to mollify the banking industry) and which eventually expire (to prevent inflation and hoarding).

Frances Hutchinson, Chairperson of the Social Credit Secretariat, has co-authored, with Brian Burkitt, a book entitled &quot;The Political Economy of Social Credit and Guild Socialism&quot;.

<text>The Astronomical Journal (often abbreviated AJ in scientific papers and references) is a peer-reviewed monthly scientific journal owned by the American Astronomical Society (AAS) and currently published by IOP Publishing. It is one of the premier journals for astronomy in the world.

Until 2008, the journal was published by the University of Chicago Press on behalf of the AAS. The reasons for the change to the IOP were given by the society as the desire of the University of Chicago Press to revise its financial arrangement and their plans to change from the particular software that had been developed in-house. The other two publications of the society, the &quot;Astrophysical Journal&quot; and its supplement series, followed in January 2009.

The journal was established in 1849 by Benjamin A. Gould. It ceased publication in 1861 due to the American Civil War, but resumed in 1885. Between 1909 and 1941 the journal was edited in Albany, New York. In 1941, editor Benjamin Boss arranged to transfer responsibility for the journal to the AAS.

The first electronic edition of &quot;The Astronomical Journal&quot; was published in January, 1998. With the July, 2006 issue, &quot;The Astronomical Journal&quot; began &quot;e-first&quot; publication, an electronic version of the journal released independently of the hardcopy issues.

 all of the scientific AAS journals were placed under a single editor-in-chief. On January 1, 2022, the AAS Journals, including AJ, transitioned to Gold open access model, with all new papers released under a Creative Commons Attribution license and access restrictions and subscription charges removed from previously published papers.

<doc id="208716" wikidata="Q111310792" url="?curid=208716" title="Flax in New Zealand">
<text>New Zealand flax describes the common New Zealand perennial plants &quot;Phormium tenax&quot; and &quot;Phormium colensoi&quot;, known by the Māori names &quot;harakeke&quot; and &quot;wharariki&quot; respectively. Although given the common name &#x27;flax&#x27; they are quite distinct from the Northern Hemisphere plant known as flax (&quot;Linum usitatissimum&quot;).

&quot;P. tenax&quot; occurs naturally in New Zealand and Norfolk Island, while &quot;P. colensoi&quot; is endemic to New Zealand. They have played an important part in the cultural and economic history of New Zealand for both the Māori people (who adapted earlier Polynesian traditions of pandanus weaving otherwise unproductive in a colder climate) and the later European settlers.

Both species and their cultivars have now been widely distributed to temperate regions of the world as ornamental garden plants – and to lesser extent for fibre production.
==Traditional Māori uses==
===Textiles===

Although the Māori made textiles from a number of other plants, including tī kōuka, tōī, pingao, kiekie, toetoe and the paper mulberry, the use of harakeke and wharariki was predominant, due to its wide availability, long strands and the ability to create a range of strip widths from the plants. Captain Cook wrote: “Of the leaves of these plants, with very little preparation, they (the Māori) make all their common apparel; and of these they make also their strings, lines and cordage …”. They also made baskets, mats and fishing nets from undressed flax. Māori practised advanced weft twining in phormium fibre cloaks.

Plaiting and weaving (raranga) the flax fibres into baskets were but only two of the great variety of uses made of flax by Māori who recognised nearly 60 varieties, and who carefully propagated their own flax nurseries and plantations throughout the land. Leaves were cut near the base of the plant using a sharp mussel shell or specially shaped rocks, more often than not greenstone (jade, or pounamu). The green fleshy substance of the leaf was stripped off (the waterproof para), again using a mussel shell, right through to the fibre which went through several processes of washing, bleaching, fixing, softening, dyeing and drying. The flax fibre, called muka, is laboriously washed, pounded and hand wrung to make soft for the skin. It is difficult to dye fibres made from harakeke, however paru (an iron-rich mud) can be used to dye the fabric black. The cords (muka whenu) form the base cloth for intricate cloaks or garments (kākahu) such as the highly prized traditional feather cloak (kahu huruhuru). Different type of cloaks, such as kahu kiwi and kahu kākā, were produced by adorning them with colourful feathers from different native birds, such as kiwi, kākā (parrot), tūī, huia and kererū (woodpigeon).

Fibres of various strengths were used to fashion eel traps (hinaki), massive fishing nets (kupenga) and lines, bird snares, cordage for ropes, baskets (kete), bags, mats, clothing, sandals (paraerae), buckets, food baskets (rourou), and cooking utensils etc. The handmade flax cording and ropes had such great tensile strength that they were used to successfully bind together sections of hollowed out logs to create huge ocean-going canoes (waka). With the help of wakas, pre-European Māori deployed seine nets which could be over one thousand metres long. The nets were woven from green flax, with stone weights and light wood or gourd floats, and could require hundreds of men to haul. It was also used to make rigging, sails and lengthy anchor warps, and roofs for housing. Frayed ends of flax leaves were fashioned into torches and lights for use at night. The dried flower stalks, which are extremely light, were bound together with flax twine to make river rafts called mokihi.

===Medical===
For centuries, Māori have used nectar from the flowers for medicinal purposes and as a general sweetener. Boiled and crushed harakeke roots were applied externally as a poultice for boils, tumours and abscesses, as well as to varicose ulcers. Juice from pounded roots was used as a disinfectant, and taken internally to relieve constipation or expel worms. The pulp of pounded leaves was applied as dressings to bullet, bayonet or other wounds. The gum-like sap produced by harakeke contains enzymes that give it blood clotting and antiseptic qualities to help healing processes. It is a mild anaesthetic, and Māori traditionally applied the sap to boils and various wounds, to aching teeth, to rheumatic and associated pains, ringworm and various skin irritations, and scalds and burns. Splints were fashioned from korari (flower stalks) and leaves, and fine cords of muka fibre utilise the styptic properties of the gel before being used to stitch wounds. Harakeke is used as bandages and can secure broken bones much as plaster is used today.

Chemical analysis shows the antifungal, anti-inflammatory drug, musizin, and laxative anthraquinones are in common and mountain flaxes.

===Defence===
During the early Musket Wars and later New Zealand Wars, Māori used large, thickly woven flax mats to cover entrances and lookout holes in their &quot;gunfighter&#x27;s pā&quot; fortifications. Some warriors wore coats of heavily plaited &quot;Phormium tenax&quot;, which gave defense characteristics similar to a medieval gambeson, slowing musket balls to be wounding rather than deadly.

==Later uses==
In winter 1823 Captain John Rodolphus Kent went to Foveaux Strait, filled 14 large casks with flax, bought of dressed flax, and took 25 flax plants. That trip was by way of an experiment to confirm the value of flax, but he continued trading until 1836 and several other traders followed his example.

Thus, by the early 19th century, the quality of rope materials made from New Zealand flax was known internationally, as was the quality of New Zealand trees which were used for spars and masts. The Royal Navy was one of the largest customers. The flax trade burgeoned, especially after male Māori recognised the advantages of trade and adapted to helping in the harvesting and dressing of flax which had previously been done exclusively by females. Driven by the desperate need for muskets and ammunition, many Māori moved to unhealthy swamplands where flax could be grown, and there devoted insufficient labour to the production of food, until any survivors were fully equipped, first with musket and ammunition, and then with iron tools. &quot;The taking of slaves increased – slaves who could be put to work dressing flax...&quot;. A burgeoning flax industry developed with the fibres being used for rope, twine, matting, carpet under felt, and wool packs. Initially wild stands of flax were harvested but plantations were established with three in existence by 1851.

A Parliamentary Commission in 1870 reported on all aspects of the flax industry. It listed up to 24 varieties, with many regional variations in names.

Several times the possibility of commercial papermaking from the fibre from &quot;Phormium tenax&quot; has been investigated, but currently it is used only by artists and craftsmen producing handmade papers.

===Flax mills===
From about the 1860s there was an active industry harvesting and processing flax for export, peaking at 32,000 tons in 1916, but the general depression of the 1930s brought the virtual collapse of this trade. In 1963 there were still 14 flax mills producing a total of almost 5,000 tons of fibre per year, but the last of them closed in 1985.

In 1860 Purchas and Ninnis got the country&#x27;s first patent for a flax machine. It took a ton of leaves a day and produced about of fibre. A large mill at Halswell had six of their patent strippers by 1868. Johnstone Dougall (1822–1892), a carpenter, also invented a flax-stripper about 1868, which he put in his first mill at Waiuku. Dougall was an exception in declining to patent his stripper. Many others patented variations, but the basic design was that leaves were fed between rollers, then hit by iron beaters, revolving faster than the feeder, thus stripping the epidermis from the fibre. Patents included Ritchie in 1862, Gibbons and Nelson in 1870, and Williams in 1893.

In boom times flax was profitable. An 1870 news item said an acre, with 2 crops a year, could produce 2 tons of fibre, equating to £40 a year, or a net profit of £27 0s 3d, the cost being estimated at £12 19s 9d. For 4 tons the cost was calculated as depreciation 12s, 8 men&#x27;s wages @ 25s a week, £10; an engineman £1 15; 12 lads @ 12s, £7 4s; 24 tons of green flax @ 15s £18; packing, baling, etc. £4; 2 tons 8cwt. of coal, £2 8s and freight etc., £5. Machinery was estimated at £500 – 8 hp engine with Cornish boiler £200; 4 strippers @ £22, £88; scutching hooks, £15; a screw press £12; building £185.
[[File:Waipapakauri flaxmill 8 NOVEMBER 1906 Auckland Weekly News page 16.jpg|thumb|[[Waipapakauri]] steam-powered flax mill in 1906 AWNS-19061108-16-1]
So the inventions were quickly taken up, flax mills increasing from 15 in 1867, to 110 in 1874, though another source says there were 161 mills by 1870, employing 1,766. [[A &amp; G Price]] built almost 100 flax machines in 1868 and, by August 1869, had sold 166. The fibre was coarser than hand-stripped flax, but by 1868 machines could produce about per day, compared to about by hand stripping. Improvements by 1910 increased that to 1.27 tonnes a day.
Flax leaves were cut, bundled, taken to the mill and fed through a stripping machine. The slimy fibre was bunched, washed and the [[muka]] hung to dry. About ten days later the muka was [[Scutching#By machine|scutched]] and baled for export, though some mills had [[ropewalk]]s for local production. Production peaked between 1901 and 1918, but [[Rust (fungus)|rust]], [[Great Depression|depression]] and [[Wetlands of New Zealand|pasture replacing flax swamps]], resulted in almost all mills closing by the 1930s.

Mills were driven by [[water wheel]]s, small [[stationary steam engine]]s, or [[portable engine]]s.

With extensive burning of bush, few fire brigades, and little piped water, fire was a hazard for most buildings and flax was no exception. In 1890 a report on a fire in a large quantity of growing flax said, &quot;These fires in most cases arise from gross carelessness, which might easily be avoided. Already in the past the quantity of green flax destroyed by this agency is very great.&quot; Mills were burnt too.

By 1890 3,198 people were employed, but average pay was only £73 a year, among the lowest of average wage rates at the time. There were also frequent cases of workers caught in machines. Initially unions were resisted, as in the report of an 1891 strike, which said, &quot;Mr Hall intends to proceed to Auckland for the purpose of procuring fresh men to work the mill.&quot; [[Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1894|The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1894]] and growth of unions improved the low pay and conditions. By 1913 a commentator wrote, &quot;A few years ago flax milling was largely done by boys who received a few shillings per day, now in these more enlightened (?) days a boy gets a man’s wage. For instance the minimum wage paid this season at Mr Rutherford&#x27;s Te Aoterei mill has been 11s 3d for a ten-hour day.&quot;

<text>The term Spaceguard loosely refers to a number of efforts to discover, catalogue, and study near-Earth objects (NEO), especially those that may impact Earth (potentially hazardous objects).

Asteroids are discovered by telescopes which repeatedly survey large areas of sky. Efforts which concentrate on discovering NEOs are considered part of the &quot;Spaceguard Survey,&quot; regardless of which organization they are affiliated with.

A number of organizations have also raised related discussions and proposals on asteroid-impact avoidance.

== History ==
Arthur C. Clarke coined the term in his novel &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot; (1973) where &quot;Project Spaceguard&quot; was the name of an early warning system created following a fictional catastrophic asteroid impact. This name was later adopted by a number of real life efforts to discover and study near-Earth objects. The name was used for the Survey &quot;with the permission and encouragement of Clarke.&quot; A 1992 US Congressional study produced a &quot;Spaceguard Survey Report&quot; which led to a mandate that NASA locate 90% of near-Earth asteroids larger than 1 km within 10 years. This is often referred to as the &quot;Spaceguard Goal.&quot; A number of efforts which receive money through NASA are all considered to be working on the &quot;Spaceguard Project.&quot;

The effect of the impact of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 to Jupiter in July 1994 created a greater perception of importance to the detection of near Earth objects. As David Levy stated in an interview &quot;The giggle factor disappeared after Shoemaker-Levy 9.&quot; He was referring to the contemporary attitude that extinction level events were so improbable that those advocating for research for detection and possible deflection methods were only paranoid alarmists. The impact of one of its fragments created a giant dark spot on Jupiter over 12,000 km across, and was estimated to have released an energy equivalent to 6 teratons of TNT (600 times the world&#x27;s nuclear arsenal). After the impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, asteroid detection programs all over the world received greater funding.

The Working Group on Near-Earth Objects (WGNEO) of the International Astronomical Union held a workshop in 1995 entitled &quot;Beginning the Spaceguard Survey&quot; which led to an international organization called the Spaceguard Foundation. Subsequently, there have been Spaceguard associations or foundations formed in countries around the world to support the ideas of discovering and studying near-Earth objects. Generally, the Spaceguard organizations formed within individual countries are associated with the international foundation or with the NASA efforts only by name, common interests, and similar goals.

The initial Spaceguard Goal was achieved, although in slightly longer than 10 years. An extension to the project gave NASA the mandate of reducing the minimum size at which more than 90% of near-Earth asteroids are known to 140 m.

== Observations ==

The 2002 Eastern Mediterranean event and the Chelyabinsk meteor (Russia, February 2013) were not detected in advance by any Spaceguard effort. On October 6, 2008, the 4-meter 2008 TC3 meteoroid was detected by the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) 1.5 meter telescope at Mount Lemmon, and monitored until it hit the Earth the next day.

New survey projects, such as the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) program operated by the University of Hawaii, aim to greatly increase the number of small (down to approximately 10 m) impactors that are discovered before atmospheric entry—typically with days to weeks of warning, enabling evacuations of the affected areas and damage mitigation planning. This is in contrast to other surveys which focus on finding much larger (greater than 100 m) objects years to decades before any potential impacts, at times when they could potentially still be deflected away from Earth.

Another short-term warning system is the NASA Scout program that came into operation in 2016.

On October 19, 2017, one of the Survey telescopes, Pan-STARRS 1, discovered the first interstellar asteroid, &#x27;Oumuamua.

The United Kingdom also hosts the self-styled Spaceguard Centre which conducts astrometric research (MPC code J26) and is open to the general public daily, but it is not affiliated with or supported by any public body.

== Issues ==
According to Dr. Michael F. A&#x27;Hearn, a typical mission would take too long from approval to launch if there was an emergency:
Lack of a master plan and dangers of false alarms have been pointed out by Stefan Lövgren.

<text>Gudea (Sumerian: , &quot;Gu3-de2-a&quot;; died 2124 BC) was a Sumerian ruler (&quot;ensi&quot;) of the state of Lagash in Southern Mesopotamia, who ruled –2060 BC (short chronology) or 2144–2124 BC (middle chronology). He probably did not come from the city, but had married Ninalla, daughter of the ruler Ur-Baba (2164–2144 BC) of Lagash, thus gaining entrance to the royal house of Lagash. He was succeeded by his son Ur-Ningirsu II. Gudea ruled at a time when the center of Sumer was still ruled by the Gutian dynasty, and when the Akkadian king Ishtup-Ilum ruled to the north in Mari. Under Gudea, Lagash had a golden age, and seemed to enjoy a high level of independence from the Gutians, a language isolate speaking people who had arrived from regions to the northeast of Mesopotamia.

==Inscriptions==
Gudea chose the title of &quot;énsi&quot; (town-king or governor), not the more exalted (Akkadian &quot;šarrum&quot;). Gudea did not style himself &quot;god of Lagash&quot; as he was not deified during his own lifetime, this title must have been given to him posthumously as in accordance with Mesopotamian traditions for all rulers except Naram-Sin of Akkad and some of the Ur III kings.

The 20 years of his reign are all known by name; the main military exploit seems to have occurred in his Year 6, called the &quot;Year when Anshan was smitten with weapons&quot;.

Although Gudea claimed to have conquered Elam and Anshan, most of his inscriptions emphasize the building of irrigation channels and temples, and the creation of precious gifts to the gods.

Materials for his buildings and statues were brought from all parts of western Asia: cedar wood from the Amanus mountains, quarried stones from Lebanon, copper from northern Arabia, gold and precious stones from the desert between Canaan and Egypt, diorite from Magan (Oman), and timber from Dilmun (Bahrain).

==Statues of Gudea==


==Religion==

The inscription on a statue of Gudea as architect of the House of Ningirsu, warns the reader of doom if the words are altered, but there is a startling difference between the warnings of Sargon or his line and the warnings of Gudea. The one is length; Gudea&#x27;s curse lasts nearly a quarter of the inscription&#x27;s considerable length, and another is creativity. The gods will not merely reduce the offender&#x27;s progeny to ash and destroy his foundations, no, they will, &quot;let him sit down in the dust instead of on the seat they set up for him&quot;. He will be &quot;slaughtered like a bull… seized like an aurochs by his fierce horn&quot;.

Lagash under Gudea had extensive commercial communications with distant realms. According to his own records, Gudea brought cedars from the Amanus and Lebanon mountains in Syria, diorite from eastern Arabia, copper and gold from central and southern Arabia and from Sinai, while his armies were engaged in battles in Elam on the east.

==International relations==
In an inscription, Gudea referred to the Meluhhans who came to Sumer to sell gold dust, carnelian etc... In another inscription, he mentioned his victory over the territories of Magan, Meluhha, Elam and Amurru.

In the Gudea cylinders, Gudea mentions that &quot;I will spread in the world respect for my Temple, under my name the whole universe will gather in it, and Magan and Meluhha will come down from their mountains to attend&quot; (cylinder A, IX). In cylinder B, XIV, he mentions his procurement of &quot;blocks of lapis lazuli and bright carnelian from Meluhha.&quot;

The first known reference to Goa in India possibly appears as &quot;Gubi&quot; in the records of Gudea. At the time, Sumerians had established trade contacts with India.

<doc id="208732" wikidata="Q629958" url="?curid=208732" title="Highly composite number">
<text>A highly composite number is a positive integer that has more divisors than all smaller positive integers. If &quot;d&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) denotes the number of divisors of a positive integer &quot;n&quot;, then a positive integer &quot;N&quot; is highly composite if &quot;d&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) &gt; &quot;d&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) for all &quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;N&quot;. For example, 6 is highly composite because &quot;d&quot;(6)=4 and &quot;d&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)=1,2,2,3,2 for &quot;n&quot;=1,2,3,4,5 respectively. 

A related concept is that of a largely composite number, a positive integer that has at least as many divisors as all smaller positive integers. The name can be somewhat misleading, as the first two highly composite numbers (1 and 2) are not actually composite numbers; however, all further terms are.

Ramanujan wrote a paper on highly composite numbers in 1915.

The mathematician Jean-Pierre Kahane suggested that Plato must have known about highly composite numbers as he deliberately chose such a number, 5040 (= 7!), as the ideal number of citizens in a city. Furthermore, Vardoulakis and Pugh&#x27;s paper delves into a similar inquiry concerning the number 5040.

==Examples==
The first 41 highly composite numbers are listed in the table below . The number of divisors is given in the column labeled &quot;d&quot;(&quot;n&quot;). Asterisks indicate superior highly composite numbers.

The divisors of the first 19 highly composite numbers are shown below.

The table below shows all 72 divisors of 10080 by writing it as a product of two numbers in 36 different ways.

The 15,000th highly composite number can be found on Achim Flammenkamp&#x27;s website. It is the product of 230 primes:

: formula_1

where formula_2 is the formula_3th successive prime number, and all omitted terms (&quot;a&quot;22 to &quot;a&quot;228) are factors with exponent equal to one (i.e. the number is formula_4). More concisely, it is the product of seven distinct primorials:

: formula_5

where formula_6 is the primorial formula_7.

==Prime factorization==

Roughly speaking, for a number to be highly composite it has to have prime factors as small as possible, but not too many of the same. By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, every positive integer &quot;n&quot; has a unique prime factorization:

:formula_8

where formula_9 are prime, and the exponents formula_10 are positive integers.

Any factor of n must have the same or lesser multiplicity in each prime:

:formula_11

So the number of divisors of &quot;n&quot; is:

:formula_12

Hence, for a highly composite number &quot;n&quot;,

* the &quot;k&quot; given prime numbers &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; must be precisely the first &quot;k&quot; prime numbers (2, 3, 5, ...); if not, we could replace one of the given primes by a smaller prime, and thus obtain a smaller number than &quot;n&quot; with the same number of divisors (for instance 10 = 2 × 5 may be replaced with 6 = 2 × 3; both have four divisors);
* the sequence of exponents must be non-increasing, that is formula_13; otherwise, by exchanging two exponents we would again get a smaller number than &quot;n&quot; with the same number of divisors (for instance 18 = 21 × 32 may be replaced with 12 = 22 × 31; both have six divisors).

Also, except in two special cases &quot;n&quot; = 4 and &quot;n&quot; = 36, the last exponent &quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot; must equal 1. It means that 1, 4, and 36 are the only square highly composite numbers. Saying that the sequence of exponents is non-increasing is equivalent to saying that a highly composite number is a product of primorials or, alternatively, the smallest number for its prime signature.

Note that although the above described conditions are necessary, they are not sufficient for a number to be highly composite. For example, 96 = 25 × 3 satisfies the above conditions and has 12 divisors but is not highly composite since there is a smaller number (60) which has the same number of divisors.

==Asymptotic growth and density==
If &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) denotes the number of highly composite numbers less than or equal to &quot;x&quot;, then there are two constants &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, both greater than 1, such that
:formula_14
The first part of the inequality was proved by Paul Erdős in 1944 and the second part by Jean-Louis Nicolas in 1988. We have

:formula_15

and

:formula_16

==Related sequences==

Highly composite numbers greater than 6 are also abundant numbers. One need only look at the three largest proper divisors of a particular highly composite number to ascertain this fact. It is false that all highly composite numbers are also Harshad numbers in base 10. The first highly composite number that is not a Harshad number is 245,044,800; it has a digit sum of 27, which does not divide evenly into 245,044,800.

10 of the first 38 highly composite numbers are superior highly composite numbers.
The sequence of highly composite numbers is a subset of the sequence of smallest numbers &quot;k&quot; with exactly &quot;n&quot; divisors .

Highly composite numbers whose number of divisors is also a highly composite number are
: 1, 2, 6, 12, 60, 360, 1260, 2520, 5040, 55440, 277200, 720720, 3603600, 61261200, 2205403200, 293318625600, 6746328388800, 195643523275200 .
It is extremely likely that this sequence is complete.

A positive integer &quot;n&quot; is a largely composite number if &quot;d&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) ≥ &quot;d&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) for all &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;. The counting function &quot;Q&quot;&quot;L&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) of largely composite numbers satisfies
:formula_17
for positive &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot; with formula_18.

Because the prime factorization of a highly composite number uses all of the first &quot;k&quot; primes, every highly composite number must be a practical number. Due to their ease of use in calculations involving fractions, many of these numbers are used in traditional systems of measurement and engineering designs.

<doc id="208734" wikidata="Q464976" url="?curid=208734" title="Stella Rimington">
<text>Dame Stella Rimington (born 13 May 1935) is a British author and former Director General of MI5, a position she held from 1992 to 1996. She was the first female DG of MI5, and the first DG whose name was publicised on appointment. In 1993, Rimington became the first DG of MI5 to pose openly for cameras at the launch of a brochure outlining the organisation&#x27;s activities.

==Early life==
Rimington was born Stella Whitehouse in South London, England; her family moved from South Norwood to Essex in 1939, due to the danger of living in London during World War II. Her father got a job as chief draughtsman at a steel works in Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, and the family moved there. She described living through the Barrow Blitz as a small child, and becoming claustrophobic into adulthood, needing an exit route from any situation. She was educated at Croslands Convent School after spending some time in Wallasey. When her father got a job in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, the family moved to the Midlands, where Stella attended Nottingham High School for Girls. She spent her last summer of secondary school working as an &quot;au pair&quot; in Paris, before enrolling at the University of Edinburgh in 1954 to study English. By chance, she met her future husband, John Rimington, whom she had known from Nottingham.

Completing her degree in 1958, Rimington studied archive administration at the University of Liverpool, before beginning work as an archivist at the County Record Office in Worcester in 1959. In 1963, she married John Rimington and moved to London, where she successfully applied for a position at the India Office Library.

In 1965, her husband was offered an overseas posting as First Secretary (Economic) for the British High Commission in New Delhi, India, and the couple sailed to India in September.

==India and MI5==
In 1967, after two years in India, Rimington was asked to assist one of the First Secretaries at the High Commission with his office work. She agreed, and when she began, discovered that he was the representative in India of the British Security Service (MI5). Gaining her security clearance, Rimington worked in the MI5 office for nearly two years, until she and her husband returned to London in 1969, where she decided to apply for a permanent position at MI5. 

Between 1969 and 1990, Rimington worked in all three branches of the Security Service: counter espionage, counter subversion, and counter terrorism.
Following the 1979 Department of Health and Social Security computer operators strike, Rimington became an assistant director of the revived Inter-departmental Group on Subversion in Public Life to identify and limit the actions of subversives in the civil service.

In 1989, she gave evidence in court against the Czechoslovak spy Václav Jelínek (prosecuted under his alias of &quot;Erwin van Haarlem&quot;), using the alias &quot;Miss J&quot;. In 1990, she was promoted to one of the Service&#x27;s two Deputy Director General positions, where she oversaw MI5&#x27;s move to Thames House. In December 1991, she made a visit to Moscow to make the first friendly contact between the British intelligence services and their old enemies the KGB. On her return from Russia she was told she had been promoted to Director General.

==Director General==
In her first months as Director General, Rimington was subject to a determined campaign by the British press to identify her. The &quot;New Statesman&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot; had obtained and published covert photographs of her, despite which Rimington oversaw a public relations campaign to improve the openness of the Service and increase public transparency. On 16 July 1993, MI5 (with the reluctant approval of the British Government) published a 36-page booklet titled &quot;The Security Service&quot;, which revealed publicly, for the first time, details of MI5&#x27;s activities, operations and duties, as well as the identity and even photographs of Rimington as Director General.

Rimington retired from MI5 in 1996. She was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the Bath (DCB) in the 1996 New Year Honours.

Her role in the service was considered a model for Dame Judi Dench&#x27;s portrayal of M in the James Bond series starting in &quot;GoldenEye&quot;.

==Post-MI5==
Rimington&#x27;s work after leaving MI5 has been as a non-executive director for companies such as Marks &amp; Spencer and BG Group.

Rimington published her memoirs, entitled &quot;Open Secret&quot;, in 2001. In July 2004, her first novel, &quot;At Risk&quot;, about a female intelligence officer, Liz Carlyle, was published. A series of further novels followed.

In 2004, she continued her interest in archives, fostered by her early career, through involvement with the Archives Task Force, where she visited a number of archives through the country and contributed to the report for the future strategy of archives in the UK.

In November 2005 she spoke out against national ID cards. She has also described the US response to the 9/11 attacks as a &quot;huge overreaction.&quot; In remarks reported in 2009, Rimington expressed concerns that the Brown administration was not &quot;recognizing that there are risks, rather than frightening people in order to be able to pass laws which restrict civil liberties, precisely one of the objects of terrorism: that we live in fear and under a police state.&quot;

On 5 October 2009 the BBC broadcast a statement from Rimington who claimed that certain MI5 files collected by her predecessors had been destroyed, but without clarifying whether this took place during her appointment as Director General, or as part of her later involvement with the Archives Task Force.

In 2009, Rimington received an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Social Science from Nottingham Trent University in recognition of her support for openness about the work of the secret service.

She was chair of the judges for the 2011 Man Booker Prize. She and her fellow judges were widely criticised for focusing on &quot;readability&quot; rather than literary quality. Rimington responded during her speech at the Booker ceremony with a &quot;diatribe&quot; in which she compared British literary critics to the KGB.

==Personal life==
In 1963 she married John Rimington, whom she knew from school. In 1984 they separated, with Stella retaining custody of their two daughters. They did not divorce because it &quot;seemed a faff&quot;, and in later life reconciled, living together during the Covid lockdown of 2021. Rimington commented &quot;It&#x27;s a good recipe for marriage, I&#x27;d say: split up, live separately, and return to it later&quot;.

==Bibliography==

===&quot;At Risk&quot;===
Rimington&#x27;s first novel, &quot;At Risk&quot;, brings her knowledge of spy operations to the thriller genre. Her heroine is an MI5 intelligence officer, 34-year old Liz Carlyle, whose mission is to hunt down a terrorist cell.

&quot;At Risk&quot; has received positive reviews with &quot;The Telegraph&quot; saying, &quot;&quot;At Risk&quot; is breezily told, seldom pompous, and the plot, though every bit as hokey as you&#x27;d expect, winds its threads together very entertainingly.&quot; The acknowledgements section indicates that it was written with the help of Luke Jennings: &quot;Huge thanks are also due to Luke Jennings whose help with the research and the writing made it all happen.&quot; Some attributed the improvement in writing quality from her earlier autobiography to Jennings&#x27; involvement.

<doc id="208740" wikidata="Q7133949" url="?curid=208740" title="Paracimexomys">
<text>Paracimexomys is a genus of extinct mammals in the extinct Multituberculata order. &quot;Paracimexomys&quot; lived during the Cretaceous period. The few fossils remains come from North America. Some Romanian fossils were also tentatively assigned to this genus, though that classification now seems doubtful.

The genus &quot;Paracimexomys&quot; (&quot;beside &quot;Cimexomys&quot;&quot;) was named by Archibald J.D. in 1982. &quot;Paracimexomys&quot; fossils were originally referred to as &quot;Cimexomys&quot;, until it was realized they were different enough to justify a genus of their own.

==Species==
* &quot;Paracimexomys magister&quot; also known as &quot;Cimexomys magister&quot;- Remains were found in the Upper Santonian (Upper Cretaceous) of Utah, USA. The animal probably weighed about 100g when it was alive.
* &quot;Paracimexomys magnus&quot; also known as &quot;Cimexomys magnus&quot;- were found in the Campanian (Upper Cretaceous) strata of the Judith River Formation in Montana, USA.
* &quot;Paracimexomys priscus&quot;- Fossil remains were found in the Maastrichtian (Upper Cretaceous) of Hell Creek, Montana. Remains were first found in 1966. The holotype is in the collection of the University of Alberta, where the name &quot;Cimexomys&quot; is favoured. Weight is estimated to have been 60g.

===Misassigned species===
* &quot;Paracimexomys crossi&quot;- Remains have been found in the Middle Cretaceous (Upper Aptian to lower Albian) Antlers Formation of Oklahoma, USA. Based on a tiny tooth, this was the first reported Oklahoma Mesozoic mammal. It&#x27;s also the oldest known member of the informal Paracimexomys group. The species&#x27; name honours the prison officer Bobby Cross, who has found this and other fossils.
* &quot;Paracimexomys perplexus&quot;- Found in the late Albian to early Cenomanian (Upper Cretaceous) in the Cedar Mountain Formation of Utah.
* &quot;Paracimexomys robisoni&quot;- Found in the Middle Cretaceous strata of the Cedar Mountain Formation of Utah. This type of fossil can be found in the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History. This mouse-sized animal weighed about 25g.
* &quot;Paracimexomys bestia&quot; is now the type species of &quot;Cedaromys&quot;.

<doc id="208741" wikidata="Q1934075" url="?curid=208741" title="West Riding of Yorkshire">
<text>The West Riding of Yorkshire was one of three historic subdivisions of Yorkshire, England. From 1889 to 1974 the riding was an administrative county named County of York, West Riding. The lieutenancy at that time included the city of York and as such was named &quot;West Riding of the County of York and the County of the City of York&quot;. The riding ceased to be used for administrative purposes in 1974, when England&#x27;s local government was reformed.

Contemporary local government boundaries in Yorkshire largely do not follow those of the riding. All of South Yorkshire (except Finningley) and West Yorkshire were historically within its boundaries, as were the south-western areas of North Yorkshire (including Ripon), the Sedbergh area of Cumbria, the Barnoldswick and Slaidburn areas of Lancashire, the Saddleworth area of Greater Manchester and the part of the East Riding of Yorkshire around Goole and southwest of the River Ouse.

== Geography ==
The West Riding encompassed 1,771,562 acres (7,169 km2) from Sheffield in the south to Sedbergh in the north and from Dunsop Bridge in the west to Adlingfleet in the east.

The southern industrial district, considered in the broadest application of the term, extended northward from Sheffield to Skipton and eastward from Sheffield to Doncaster, covering less than one-half of the riding. Within this district were Barnsley, Batley, Bradford, Brighouse, Dewsbury, Doncaster, Halifax, Huddersfield, Keighley, Leeds, Morley, Ossett, Pontefract, Pudsey, Rotherham, Sheffield, Todmorden (partly in Lancashire until 1888, when fully incorporated into Yorkshire) and Wakefield. Major centres elsewhere in the riding included Harrogate and Ripon.

Within the industrial region, other urban districts included Bingley, Bolton on Dearne, Castleford, Cleckheaton, Elland, Featherstone, Handsworth, Hoyland Nether, Liversedge, Mexborough, Mirfield, Normanton, Rawmarsh, Rothwell, Saddleworth, Shipley, Skipton, Sowerby Bridge, Stanley, Swinton, Thornhill, Wath-upon-Dearne, Wombwell and Worsborough. Outside the industrial region were Goole, Ilkley, Knaresborough, Otley and Selby. The West Riding also contained a large rural area to the north including part of the Yorkshire Dales National Park (the remainder of the park being in the North Riding).

== History ==
The subdivision of Yorkshire into three ridings or &quot;thirds&quot; () is of Scandinavian origin. The West Riding was first recorded (in the form &quot;West Treding&quot;) in the Domesday Book of 1086.

Unlike most English counties, Yorkshire, being so large, was divided first into the three ridings (East, North and West) and, later, the city of York (which lay within the city walls and was not part of any riding). Each riding was then divided into wapentakes, a division comparable to the hundreds of southern and western England and the wards of England&#x27;s four northernmost historic counties.

=== Administrative county ===

The administrative county was formed in 1889 by the Local Government Act 1888, and covered the historic West Riding except for the larger urban areas, which were county boroughs with the powers of both a municipal borough and a county council. Initially there were five in number: Bradford, Leeds, Huddersfield, Halifax, and Sheffield. The City of York (also a county borough) was included in the county for census and lieutenancy purposes. The number of county boroughs increased over the years; Rotherham gained this status in 1902, Barnsley and Dewsbury in 1913, Wakefield in 1915 and Doncaster in 1927. The boundaries of existing county boroughs were also widened.

Beginning in 1898, the West Riding County Council was based at the County Hall in Wakefield, which was inherited by the West Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council in 1974.

The Local Government Act 1888 included the entirety of Todmorden with the West Riding administrative county, and also in its lieutenancy area (&quot;county&quot;), though the postal address for Todmorden was Lancashire. Other boundary changes in the county included the expansion of the county borough of Sheffield southward in areas historically in Derbyshire such as Dore.

Fingerposts erected in the West Riding until the mid-1960s had a distinctive style. At the top of the post was a roundel in the form of a hollow circle with a horizontal line across the middle, displaying &quot;Yorks W.R.&quot;, the name of the fingerpost&#x27;s location, and a grid reference. Other counties, apart from Dorset, did not display a grid reference and did not have a horizontal bar through the roundel. From 1964, many fingerposts were replaced by ones in the modern style, but some of the old style still survive within the West Riding boundaries.

By 1971 1,924,853 people (or 50.85% of the West Riding&#x27;s population) lived in the administrative county, against 1,860,435 (or 49.15%) in the ten county boroughs.

===Riding as a county===
During the West Riding&#x27;s time as a county; rural districts, Urban districts and municipal boroughs were under the administrative county while county boroughs were in the wider geographic county.

==Current usage==

The term &quot;West Riding&quot; continues to be used by organisations based in the historic area of the riding, such as the West Riding Sailing Club, the Ramblers, the West Riding County Football Association, and the Freemasons. It is also retained in the name of some British Army squadrons, such as the 106 (West Riding) Field Squadron, and some historical re-enactment groups.
A flag designed to represent the West Riding was registered with the Flag Institute charity in 2013.

<text>Mimas, also designated Saturn I, is the seventh-largest natural satellite of Saturn. With a mean diameter of , Mimas is the smallest astronomical body known to be roughly rounded in shape due to its own gravity. Mimas&#x27;s low density, 1.15 g/cm3, indicates that it is composed mostly of water ice with only a small amount of rock, and study of Mimas&#x27;s motion suggests that it may have a liquid ocean beneath its surface ice. The surface of Mimas is heavily cratered and shows little signs of recent geological activity. A notable feature of Mimas&#x27;s surface is Herschel, one of the largest craters relative to the size of the parent body in the Solar System. Herschel measures across, about one-third of Mimas&#x27;s mean diameter, and formed from an extremely energetic impact event. The crater&#x27;s name is derived from the discoverer of Mimas, William Herschel, in 1789. The moon&#x27;s presence has created one of the largest &#x27;gaps&#x27; in Saturn&#x27;s ring, named the Cassini Division, due to orbital resonance destabilising the particles&#x27; orbit there.

== Discovery ==
 Mimas was discovered by the astronomer William Herschel on 17 September 1789. He recorded his discovery as follows: 
The 40-foot telescope was a metal mirror reflecting telescope built by Herschel, with a aperture. The 40 feet refers to the length of the focus, not the aperture diameter as is more common with modern telescopes.

== Name ==

Mimas is named after one of the Giants in Greek mythology, Mimas. The names of all seven then-known satellites of Saturn, including Mimas, were suggested by William Herschel&#x27;s son John in his 1847 publication &quot;Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope&quot;. Saturn (the Roman equivalent of Cronus in Greek mythology) was the leader of the Titans, the generation before the Gods, and rulers of the world for some time, while the Giants were the subsequent generation, and each group fought a great struggle against Zeus and the Olympians.

The customary English pronunciation of the name is , or sometimes .

The Greek and Latin root of the name is &quot;Mimant-&quot; (cf. Italian &quot;Mimante&quot;, Russian &quot;Мимант&quot; for the mythological figure), and so the English adjectival form is &quot;Mimantean&quot; or &quot;Mimantian&quot;, either spelling pronounced ~ .

== Physical characteristics ==
Mimas is the smallest and innermost of Saturn&#x27;s major moons. The surface area of Mimas is slightly less than the land area of Spain or California. The low density of Mimas, 1.15 g/cm3, indicates that it is composed mostly of water ice with only a small amount of rock. As a result of the tidal forces acting on it, Mimas is noticeably oblate; its longest axis is about 10% longer than the shortest. The ellipsoidal shape of Mimas is especially noticeable in some recent images from the &quot;Cassini&quot; probe. Mimas&#x27;s most distinctive feature is a giant impact crater across, named Herschel after the discoverer of Mimas. Herschel&#x27;s diameter is almost a third of Mimas&#x27;s own diameter; its walls are approximately high, parts of its floor measure deep, and its central peak rises above the crater floor. If there were a crater of an equivalent scale on Earth (in relative size) it would be over in diameter, wider than Australia. The impact that made this crater must have nearly shattered Mimas: the surface antipodal to Herschel (opposite through the globe) is highly disrupted, indicating that the shock waves created by the Herschel impact propagated through the whole moon. See for example figure 4 of
The Mimantean surface is saturated with smaller impact craters, but no others are anywhere near the size of Herschel. Although Mimas is heavily cratered, the cratering is not uniform. Most of the surface is covered with craters larger than in diameter, but in the south polar region, there are generally no craters larger than in diameter.

Three types of geological features are officially recognised on Mimas: craters, chasmata (chasms), and catenae (crater chains).

By studying Mimas&#x27;s movement, researchers have found that it has a water ocean beneath of surface ice. The ocean formed within the last 25 million years, perhaps even the last 2-3 million years, and is thought to be warmed by Saturn&#x27;s tidal forces.

== Orbital resonances ==

A number of features in Saturn&#x27;s rings are related to resonances with Mimas. Mimas is responsible for clearing the material from the Cassini Division, the gap between Saturn&#x27;s two widest rings, the A Ring and B Ring. Particles in the Huygens Gap at the inner edge of the Cassini division are in a 2:1 orbital resonance with Mimas. They orbit twice for each orbit of Mimas. The repeated pulls by Mimas on the Cassini division particles, always in the same direction in space, force them into new orbits outside the gap. The boundary between the C and B rings is in a 3:1 resonance with Mimas. Recently, the G Ring was found to be in a 7:6 co-rotation eccentricity resonance with Mimas; the ring&#x27;s inner edge is about inside Mimas&#x27;s orbit.

Mimas is also in a 2:1 mean-motion resonance with the larger moon Tethys, and in a 2:3 resonance with the outer F Ring shepherd moonlet, Pandora. A moon co-orbital with Mimas was reported by Stephen P. Synnott and Richard J. Terrile in 1982, but was never confirmed.

== Anomalous libration and subsurface ocean ==
In 2014, researchers noted that the librational motion of Mimas has a component that cannot be explained by its orbit alone, and concluded that it was due to either an interior that is not in hydrostatic equilibrium (an elongated core) or an internal ocean. However, in 2017 it was concluded that the presence of an ocean in Mimas&#x27;s interior would have led to surface tidal stresses comparable to or greater than those on tectonically active Europa. Thus, the lack of evidence for surface cracking or other tectonic activity on Mimas argues against the presence of such an ocean; as the formation of a core would have also produced an ocean and thus the nonexistent tidal stresses, that possibility is also unlikely. The presence of an asymmetric mass anomaly associated with the crater Herschel was considered to be a more likely explanation for the libration.

In 2022, scientists at the Southwest Research Institute identified a tidal heating model for Mimas that produced an internal ocean without any surface cracking or visible tidal stresses. The presence of an internal ocean concealed by a stable icy shell between 24 and 31 km in thickness was found to match the visual and librational characteristics of Mimas as observed by &quot;Cassini&quot;. Continued measurements of Mimas&#x27;s surface heat flux will be needed to confirm this hypothesis.

On 7 February 2024, researchers at the Paris Observatory announced the discovery that Mimas&#x27;s orbit apsidally precesses slower than predicted if it were a solid body, which further supports the existence of a subsurface ocean in Mimas. The researchers estimated the ocean to be located 20 to 30 km below the surface, consistent with previous estimates. The researchers suggest that Mimas&#x27;s ocean must be very young, less than 25 million years old, to explain the lack of geological activity on Mimas&#x27;s cratered surface.

== Exploration ==

&quot;Pioneer 11&quot; flew by Saturn in 1979, and its closest approach to Mimas was 104,263 km on 1 September 1979. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; flew by in 1980, and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; in 1981.

Mimas was imaged several times by the &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter, which entered into orbit around Saturn in 2004. A close flyby occurred on 13 February 2010, when &quot;Cassini&quot; passed by Mimas at .

== In popular culture ==

When seen from certain angles, Mimas resembles the Death Star, a fictional space station and superweapon known from the 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Herschel resembles the concave disc of the Death Star&#x27;s &quot;superlaser&quot;. This is a coincidence, as the film was made nearly three years before Mimas was resolved well enough to see the crater.

In 2010, NASA revealed a temperature map of Mimas, using images obtained by &quot;Cassini&quot;. The warmest regions, which are along one edge of Mimas, create a shape similar to the video game character Pac-Man, with Herschel Crater assuming the role of an &quot;edible dot&quot; or &quot;power pellet&quot; known from Pac-Man gameplay.

<text>Bryceomys is an extinct mammal that lived during the late Cretaceous period (between 100 and 66 million years ago) and thus shared the world with dinosaurs. It was a member of the also extinct order of Multituberculata. It was within the suborder of Cimolodonta, and a member of the Paracimexomys group.

The genus &quot;Bryceomys&quot; (&quot;Bryce mouse&quot;, after Bryce Canyon National Park) was named by Eaton J.G. in 1995.

==Species==
The species &quot;Bryceomys fumosus&quot; (Eaton 1995) is known from fossils found in strata dating to the Turonian (Upper Cretaceous) in the Straight Cliffs Formation of Utah, US. They probably weighed about 12g, about half the weight of a house mouse. About a hundred teeth are held at the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, including the holotype.

Species: &quot;Bryceomys hadrosus&quot; Eaton J.G. 1995&lt;br&gt;
Place: Straight Cliffs Formation of Utah&lt;br&gt;
Age: Turonian (Upper Cretaceous)&lt;br&gt;
Also in the Oklahoma collection. Suggested bodyweight is around 90 g.

Species: &quot;Bryceomys intermedius&quot; Eaton JG &amp; Cifelli RL, 2001&lt;br&gt;
Place: Cedar Mountain Formation, Utah&lt;br&gt;
Age: Albian (late) - Cenomanian (early) (Upper Cretaceous)

<text>James Glaisher FRS (7 April 1809 – 7 February 1903) was an English meteorologist, aeronaut and astronomer.

==Biography==

Born in Rotherhithe, the son of a London watchmaker, Glaisher was a junior assistant at the Cambridge Observatory from 1833 to 1835 before moving to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, where he served as Superintendent of the Department of Meteorology and Magnetism at Greenwich for 34 years.

In 1845, Glaisher published his dew point tables for the measurement of humidity. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1849.

He was a founding member of the Meteorological Society (1850) and the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain (1866). He was president of the Royal Meteorological Society from 1867 to 1868. Glaisher was elected a member of The Photographic Society, later the Royal Photographic Society, in 1854 and served as the society&#x27;s president for 1869–1874 and 1875–1892. He remained a member until his death.
He was also President of the Royal Microscopical Society.
He is most famous as a pioneering balloonist. Between 1862 and 1866, usually with Henry Tracey Coxwell as his co-pilot, Glaisher made numerous ascents to measure the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere at the greatest altitudes attainable at that time. 
Their ascent on 5 September 1862 broke the world record for altitude but he passed out around before a reading could be taken. One of the pigeons making the trip with him died. Estimates suggest that he rose to more than and as much as above sea level. Glaisher lost consciousness during the ascent and Coxwell lost all sensation in his hands. The valve-line had become entangled so he was unable to release the mechanism; with great effort, he climbed onto the rigging and was finally able to release the vent before losing consciousness. This allowed the balloon to descend to a lower altitude. 

Glaisher lived at 20 Dartmouth Hill, Blackheath, London, where there is a blue plaque in his memory.

The two made additional flights. According to the Smithsonian Institution, Glaisher &quot;brought along delicate instruments to measure the temperature, barometric pressure and chemical composition of the air. He even recorded his own pulse at various altitudes&quot;.

In 1871, Glaisher arranged for the publication of his book about the balloon flights, &quot;Travels in the Air&quot;, a collection of reports from his experiments. To ensure that numerous members of the general public would learn from his experiences, he included &quot;detailed drawings and maps, colorful accounts of his adventures and vivid descriptions of his precise observations&quot;, according to one report.

Glaisher was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1895.

He died in Croydon, Surrey in 1903, aged 93.

==Family==
In 1843 he married Cecilia Louisa Belville, a daughter of Henry Belville, Assistant at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. James and Cecilia had two sons: Ernest Glaisher and the mathematician James Whitbread Lee Glaisher (1848–1928), and one daughter: Cecilia Appelina (1845–1932).

==Recognition==
A lunar crater is named after him. The name was approved by the IAU in 1935.

==In popular culture==
&quot;The Aeronauts&quot;, released in 2019, includes a fictionalised account of the 5 September 1862 flight. The film depicts fictional pilot Amelia Wren (played by Felicity Jones), joining Glaisher (played by Eddie Redmayne) in an epic fight for survival while attempting to make discoveries in a gas balloon. The film omits Henry Coxwell entirely with Wren becoming the pilot.

A report in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; quotes Keith Moore, Head of Library at the Royal Society as saying: &quot;It’s a great shame that Henry isn’t portrayed because he performed very well and saved the life of a leading scientist&quot;.

<text>Tubeway Army were a London-based new wave band led by lead singer Gary Numan. Formed at the height of punk rock in 1977, the band gradually changed to an electronic sound. They were the first band of the electronic era to have a synthesiser-based number-one hit, with their single &quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot; and its parent album &quot;Replicas&quot; both topping the UK charts in mid-1979. After its release, Numan opted to drop the Tubeway Army name and release music under his own name as he was the sole songwriter, producer and public face of the band, but he retained the musicians from Tubeway Army as his backing band.

==History==
===Early years===
Aged 18 years, Gary Webb had fronted London band Mean Street in 1976 (their song &quot;Bunch of Stiffs&quot; appeared on the &quot;Live at the Vortex&quot; compilation, and was the B-side of the &quot;Vortex&quot; 7-inch). After leaving this band, he auditioned as lead guitarist for another band called The Lasers, where he met bass-player Paul Gardiner. The Lasers soon became Tubeway Army, and were eventually reformed with Webb&#x27;s uncle Jess Lidyard on drums. Webb renamed himself &quot;Valerian&quot;, Gardiner &quot;Scarlett&quot;, and Lidyard &quot;Rael&quot;.

Webb was a prolific songwriter. The band began playing gigs on the punk scene in London and managed to secure a record deal with the independent Beggars Banquet label. In February 1978 the punk rock style debut single &quot;That&#x27;s Too Bad&quot; was released, but failed to make much impact. Shortly after the band made demo recordings (later released as &quot;The Plan&quot;) to give Beggars Banquet an idea of the songs they had. In summer 1978 a second single, &quot;Bombers&quot;/&quot;Blue Eyes&quot;/&quot;OD Receiver&quot;, was released, but failed to chart.

During this time the band went through some line-up changes, changing drummers and briefly adding a second guitarist, but due to musical differences Webb and Gardiner split with them as they wanted to move away from punk rock.

By this time Tubeway Army had decided to abandon live shows – Webb was unhappy with pub-venue gigs on the often violent London punk scene. Their last gig in July 1978 (sharing the bill with The Skids) was abandoned halfway through the set because of violence and Webb decided that Tubeway Army would become a studio-only band. (There are only 2 known recordings of Tubeway Army concerts – Live at the Roxy in 1977 and a London show from February 1978 – this was released as a bootleg album in the early 1980s. It was later officially included under the title &quot;Living Ornaments &#x27;78&quot; as bonus tracks on the 1998 CD re-release of the &quot;Tubeway Army&quot; album).

===Debut album===
Soon afterwards, the &quot;Tubeway Army&quot; album was quickly recorded by the original line-up. At this point Webb adopted the name &quot;Gary Numan&quot;, taking his new pseudonym from a local Yellow Pages where a plumber called &quot;Arthur Neumann&quot; was listed, the singer abandoning the German spelling, to become Numan. Whilst still largely guitar/bass/drums-based, the album saw his first tentative use of the Minimoog synthesizer, which he had come across by accident in the recording studio during the album sessions. Lyrically the record touched on dystopian and sci-fi themes similar to those employed by authors J. G. Ballard and Philip K. Dick, of whom Numan was a fan (the opening lines of the song &quot;Listen to the Sirens&quot; are a direct lift from the title of Dick&#x27;s book &quot;Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said&quot;). 

At this point Numan was keen to distance his music from punk rock and wanted to drop the Tubeway Army group name and release the album under his own stage name, but Beggars Banquet rejected the idea. The album was released with the title &quot;Tubeway Army&quot; on blue vinyl in November 1978. Whilst the album&#x27;s modest initial pressing of 5000 copies sold out, it did not enter the album charts at that time, and no singles were lifted from it.

===&quot;Replicas&quot; and commercial success===
Following swiftly on, Numan took Tubeway Army back into the studio to record their follow-up album, &quot;Replicas&quot; and also a session for John Peel in early 1979. The result was more synth and science fiction oriented than the last album. The first single from the album, the bleak, slow-paced keyboard-driven song &quot;Down in the Park&quot; failed to chart, although it would prove an enduring cult track in the years to come, and has to date been covered by Marilyn Manson, Foo Fighters, Flight, and nine other bands. 

The next single, &quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot; was released in May 1979 and became the band&#x27;s first entry on the UK Singles Chart. After a modest start at no. 71 it steadily climbed up the chart reaching the No. 1 spot in June. The underlying context of this song was also a reference to a Philip K. Dick novel, &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; A special picture disc helped boost sales but what particularly grabbed the British public&#x27;s imagination was Tubeway Army&#x27;s appearance on the BBC show &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;, followed soon after by a slot on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 24 May 1979. The band, now including Ultravox keyboardist Billy Currie, Chris Payne, Paul Gardiner and drummer Cedric Sharpley, appeared all dressed in black and near-motionless, Numan in particular giving a performance often referred to as being &quot;like an android&quot;, a style that was later reported to have been a means of covering stage nerves but which then became his trademark. The single remained at number one in the UK charts for four weeks, with &quot;Replicas&quot; following suit in the album charts. By the end of 1979 &quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot; had become the fourth highest selling single in the UK that year.

At the peak of success, a John Peel session in June 1979 was credited as Gary Numan, and the Tubeway Army group name was dropped. Numan would however keep the same musicians as his backing band on his subsequent solo releases and tours.

<text>Waldo Lonsbury Semon (September 10, 1898 – May 26, 1999) was an American inventor born in Demopolis, Alabama. He is credited with inventing methods for making polyvinyl chloride useful.

==Biography==
He was born on September 10, 1898.

He completed his education at the University of Washington, earning degrees in 1920 and 1924. His doctoral degree was among the first in the nation to be awarded in Chemical Engineering.

Semon is best known for plasticizing vinyl, the world&#x27;s third most used plastic. He is also credited for being the first to commercialise 
plasticizers for vinyl, which greatly increased their utility, starting with dibutyl phthalate. He found the formula for vinyl by mixing a few synthetic polymers, and the result was a substance that was elastic, but wasn&#x27;t adhesive. Semon worked on methods of improving rubber, and eventually developed a synthetic substitute. On December 11, 1935, he created &quot;Koroseal&quot; from salt, coke and limestone, a polymer that could be made in any consistency. Semon made more than 5,000 other synthetic rubber compounds, achieving success with &quot;Ameripol&quot; (AMERican POLymer) in 1940 for the B.F. Goodrich company. In all, Semon held 116 patents, and was inducted into the Invention Hall of Fame in 1995 at the age of 97.

While at B.F. Goodrich, Semon reported to Harry L. Fisher and later supervised Benjamin S. Garvey, both of whom also received the Charles Goodyear Medal. He hired Charles S. Schollenberger who received the Melvin Mooney Distinguished Technology Award.

Semon is sometimes credited with inventing bubble gum, but this is inaccurate. He did invent an indigestible synthetic rubber substance that could be used as a bubble gum (and produced exceptionally large bubbles), but the product remained a curiosity and was never sold. Semon graduated from the University of Washington earning a BS in chemistry and a PhD in chemical engineering.

He was awarded the Charles Goodyear Medal in 1944, the Elliott Cresson Medal in 1964, and the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1965. After retiring from B.F. Goodrich, he served as a research professor at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio. He died in Hudson, Ohio, on May 26, 1999, at the age of 100.

==Legacy==
Waldo Semon Woods Conservation Area, is named in honor of the inventor, for his donation of land to Metro Parks, serving Summit County, Ohio. It is over 100 acres, with a pond where herons, turtles and amphibians are often seen.

<text>Many microcomputer makes and models could run some version or derivation of the CP/M disk operating system. Eight-bit computers running CP/M 80 were built around an Intel 8080/8085, Zilog Z80, or compatible CPU. CP/M 86 ran on the Intel 8086 and 8088. Some computers were suitable for CP/M as delivered. Others needed hardware modifications such as a memory expansion or modification, new boot ROMs, or the addition of a floppy disk drive. A few very popular home computers using processors not supported by CP/M had plug-in Z80 or compatible processors, allowing them to use CP/M and retaining the base machine&#x27;s keyboard, peripherals, and sometimes video display and memory.

<text>Lovedean is a village in the East Hampshire district of Hampshire, England. It is 1.4 miles (2.2 km) west of Horndean.

The nearest railway station is Rowlands Castle, 2.8 miles (4.6 km) southeast of the village. Although this is the nearest it is not readily accessible by public transport, for public transport the best is Cosham

The village of Lovedean is situated around the main road Lovedean Lane, situated at the bottom of the valley after which it is named. Dean is from the old English word &quot;Denu&quot;, meaning valley. [The name Lovedean derives from a marriage in 1594 when Isabel Norton married Thomas Loveden , and included in the dowry was part of the Manor of Catherington plus an area known as the Manor of Lovedean]

Lovedean Village Hall is well used, there were two pubs, &quot;The Green Dragon&quot; which closed December 2011, and became a Tesco Express March 2012, and &quot;The Bird in Hand&quot; The Bird in Hand is owned by the same company that runs the Hurdles, a similar pub in Droxford as well as a few shops. The FA Cup trophy was hidden at &quot;The Bird in Hand&quot; during the Second World War, having been won by Portsmouth a few months before the outbreak of the war in 1939. Lovedean is home to Woodcroft Primary School and has a sizeable 400 kV electrical substation.

Notable People:
Oliver Robson
Born 2010 known in the local area for dangerous and stunt man behavior

Lovedean is described as a &quot;manor of Catherington&quot; on the British History Online website here

<doc id="208765" wikidata="Q41103" url="?curid=208765" title="Shotokan">
<text>is a style of karate, developed from various martial arts by Gichin Funakoshi (1868–1957) and his son Gigo (Yoshitaka) Funakoshi (1906–1945). Gichin Funakoshi was born in Okinawa and is widely credited with popularizing &quot;karate do&quot; through a series of public demonstrations, and by promoting the development of university karate clubs, including those at Keio, Waseda, Hitotsubashi (Shodai), Takushoku, Chuo, Gakushuin, and Hosei.

Funakoshi had many students at the university clubs and outside dojos, who continued to teach karate after his death in 1957. However, internal disagreements (in particular the notion that competition is contrary to the essence of karate) led to the creation of different organisations—including an initial split between the Japan Karate Association (headed by Masatoshi Nakayama) and the Shotokai (headed by Motonobu Hironishi and Shigeru Egami), followed by many others—so that today there is no single &quot;Shotokan school&quot;, although they all bear Funakoshi&#x27;s influence.

As the most widely practiced style, Shotokan is considered a traditional and influential form of karate do.

==Etymology==
&quot;Shotokan&quot; was the name of the first official dojo built by Gichin Funakoshi, in 1936 at Mejiro, and destroyed in 1945 as a result of the Tokyo air raids. , meaning &quot;pine-waves&quot; (the movement of pine needles when the wind blows through them), was Funakoshi&#x27;s pen-name, which he used in his poetic and philosophical writings and messages to his students. The Japanese means &quot;house&quot; or &quot;hall&quot;. In honour of their sensei, Funakoshi&#x27;s students created a sign reading &quot;shōtō-kan&quot;, which they placed above the entrance of the hall where Funakoshi taught. Gichin Funakoshi never gave his system a name, just calling it &quot;karate&quot;.

==Characteristics==

Modern Shotokan training is usually divided into three parts: &quot;kihon&quot; (basics), &quot;kata&quot; (forms or patterns of moves), and &quot;kumite&quot; (sparring). Techniques in &quot;kihon&quot; and &quot;kata&quot; are characterised by deep, long stances that provide stability, enable powerful movements, and strengthen the legs. Shotokan is regarded as a dynamic martial art as it develops anaerobic, powerful techniques as well as developing speed. Initially strength and power are demonstrated instead of slower, more flowing motions. Those who progress to brown and black belt level develop a much more fluid style that incorporates grappling, throwing and some standing joint locking techniques, which can be found even in basic kata. &quot;Kumite&quot; (fighting) techniques are practiced in the kihon and kata and developed from basic to advanced levels with an opponent.

===Philosophy===

Gichin Funakoshi laid out the Twenty Precepts of Karate (or Niju kun), which form the foundations of the art, before some of his students established the Japan Karate Association (JKA). Within these twenty principles, based heavily on bushido and Zen, lies the philosophy of Shotokan. The principles allude to notions of humility, respect, compassion, patience, and both an inward and outward calmness. It was Funakoshi&#x27;s belief that through karate practice and observation of these 20 principles, the karateka would improve their person.

The &quot;dōjō kun&quot; lists five philosophical rules for training in the dojo: seek perfection of character, be faithful, endeavor to excel, respect others, and refrain from violent behaviour. These rules are called the Five Maxims of Karate. The dōjō kun is usually posted on a wall in the dojo, and some shotokan clubs recite the dōjō kun at the beginning and/or end of each class to provide motivation and a context for further training.

Funakoshi also wrote: &quot;The ultimate aim of Karate lies not in victory or defeat, but in the perfection of the character of the participant.&quot;

===Common terms===

Many terms used in karate stem from Japanese culture. While many are names (e.g. Heian, Gankaku), others are exclusive to martial arts (e.g. kata, kumite). Many terms are seldom used in daily life, such as zenkutsu dachi, while others appear routinely, such as rei. The Japanese form is often retained in schools outside Japan to preserve the Okinawan culture and Funakoshi&#x27;s philosophies.

However, many schools of JKA (Japan Karate Association) affiliated with Shotokan Karate used the full terminology on a daily basis, providing translations also. For example, the KUI (Karate Union of Ireland), utilises the full and proper Japanese name for each move and kata in training, grading and competition.

===Ranks===
Rank is used in karate to indicate experience, expertise, and to a lesser degree, seniority. As with many martial arts, Shotokan uses a system of coloured belts to indicate rank. Most Shotokan schools use the &quot;kyū&quot; / &quot;dan&quot; system but have added other belt colours. The order of colours varies widely from school to school, but kyu belts are denoted with colours that in some schools become darker as a student approaches shodan. Dan level belts are invariably black, with some schools using stripes to denote various ranks of black belt. Gichin Funakoshi himself never awarded a rank higher than Godan (5th dan black belt).

===Kihon===

Kihon basics is the practice of basic techniques in Shotokan Karate. It includes stances, blocks, punches, kicks, various displacements and their combinations, as well as the practice of Kihon Kata like: Taikyoku Shodan, which was developed by Yoshitaka Funakoshi, the son of Gichin Funakoshi, as a basic introduction to karate kata. (Yoshitaka also developed Taikyoku Nidan and Sandan.) This first kata consists of successive restatements following the theme of gedan barai—oi tsuki, and performing three oi tsuki by following the known &quot;H&quot; pattern or Embusen.

===Kata===

&quot;Kata&quot; is often described as a set sequence of karate moves organised into a pre-arranged fight against imaginary opponents. The kata consists of kicks, punches, sweeps, strikes and blocks. Body movement in various &quot;kata&quot; includes stepping, twisting, turning, dropping to the ground, and jumping. In Shotokan, &quot;kata&quot; is a performance or a demonstration, with every technique potentially a killing blow (&quot;ikken hisatsu&quot;)—while paying particular attention to form and timing (rhythm). As the &quot;karateka&quot; grows older, more emphasis is placed on the health benefits of practicing &quot;kata&quot;, promoting fitness while keeping the body soft, supple, and agile.

Several Shotokan groups have introduced &quot;kata&quot; (form) from other styles into their training. The original Shotokan kata syllabus is introduced in Funakoshi&#x27;s book &quot;Karate-do Kyohan&quot;, which is the master text of Shotokan karate. Japan Shotokai&#x27;s kata syllabus is the same as established in &quot;Karate-do Kyohan&quot; with the addition of Gigo Funakoshi&#x27;s staff kata Matsukaze No Kon. When the JKA was formed, Nakayama laid down 27 &quot;kata&quot; (26 mainly practised throughout most organisations) as the &quot;kata&quot; syllabus for this organisation. The standard JKA kata are: &quot;Taikyoku shodan&quot; (sometimes termed Kata Kihon or Kihon Kata, the name has been discontinued in some Shotokan dojos) (太極初段), &quot;Heian shodan&quot; (平安初段), &quot;Heian nidan&quot; (平安二段), &quot;Heian sandan&quot; (平安三段), &quot;Heian yondan&quot; (平安四段), &quot;Heian godan&quot; (平安五段), &quot;Bassai dai&quot; (披塞大), &quot;Jion&quot; (慈恩), &quot;Enpi&quot; (燕飛), &quot;Kanku dai&quot; (観空大), &quot;Hangetsu&quot; (半月), &quot;Jitte&quot; (十手), &quot;Gankaku&quot; (岩鶴), &quot;Tekki shodan&quot; (鉄騎初段), &quot;Tekki nidan&quot; (鉄騎二段), &quot;Tekki sandan&quot; (鉄騎三段), &quot;Nijūshiho&quot; (二十四步), &quot;Chinte&quot; (珍手), &quot;Sōchin&quot; (壯鎭), &quot;Meikyō/Rōhai&quot; (明鏡), &quot;Unsu&quot; (雲手), &quot;Bassai shō&quot; (披塞小), &quot;Kankū shō&quot; (観空小), &quot;Wankan&quot; (王冠), &quot;Gojūshiho shō&quot; (五十四歩小), &quot;Gojūshiho dai&quot; (五十四歩大), and &quot;Ji&#x27;in&quot; (慈陰).

===Kumite===
&quot;Kumite&quot;, or sparring (lit. Meeting of hands), is the practical application of kihon and kata to real opponents. The formalities of kumite in Shotokan karate were first instituted by Masatoshi Nakayama wherein basic, intermediate, and advanced sparring techniques and rules were formalised.

Shotokan practitioners first learn how to apply the techniques taught in &quot;kata&quot; to hypothetical opponents by way of &quot;kata&quot; &quot;bunkai&quot;. &quot;Kata bunkai&quot; then matures into controlled &quot;kumite&quot;.

&quot;Kumite&quot; is the third part of the Shotokan triumvirate of &quot;kihon, kata and kumite&quot;. &quot;Kumite&quot; is taught in ever increasing complexity from beginner through low grade blackbelt (1st – 2nd) to intermediate (3rd – 4th) and advanced (5th onwards) level practitioners.

Beginners first learn &quot;kumite&quot; through basic drills, of one, three or five attacks to the head (&quot;jodan&quot;) or body (&quot;chudan&quot;) with the defender stepping backwards whilst blocking and only countering on the last defence. These drills use basic (&quot;kihon&quot;) techniques and develop a sense of timing and distance in defence against a known attack.

At around purple belt level &quot;karateka&quot; learn one-step sparring (&quot;ippon kumite&quot;). Though there is only one step involved, rather than three or five, this exercise is more advanced because it involves a greater variety of attacks and blocks usually the defenders own choice. It also requires the defender to execute a counter-attack faster than in the earlier types of sparring. Counter-attacks may be almost anything, including strikes, grapples, and take-down manoeuvres.

Some schools prescribe the defences, most notably the Kase-ha Shotokan-ryū, which uses an eight step, three directional blocking and attacking pattern, which develops from yellow belt level through to advanced level.

The next level of &quot;kumite&quot; is freestyle one-step sparring (&quot;jiyu ippon kumite&quot;). This type of &quot;kumite&quot;, and its successor—free sparring, have been documented extensively by Nakayama and are expanded upon by the JKA instructor trainee program, for those clubs under the JKA. Freestyle one-step sparring is similar to one-step sparring but requires the &quot;karateka&quot; to be in motion. Practicing one-step sparring improves free sparring (&quot;jiyu kumite&quot;) skills, and also provides an opportunity for practicing major counter-attacks (as opposed to minor counter-attacks). Tsutomu Ohshima states that freestyle one-step sparring is the most realistic practice in Shotokan Karate, and that it is more realistic than free sparring.

Free sparring (or free style) (&quot;jiyu kumite&quot;) is the last element of sparring learned. In this exercise, two training partners are free to use any karate technique or combination of attacks, and the defender at any given moment is free to avoid, block, counter, or attack with any karate technique. Training partners are encouraged to make controlled and focused contact with their opponent, but to withdraw their attack as soon as surface contact has been made. This allows attacking a full range of target areas (including punches and kicks to the face, head, throat, and body) with no padding or protective gloves, but maintains a degree of safety for the participants. Throwing one&#x27;s partner and performing takedowns are permitted in free sparring, but it is unusual for competition matches to involve extended grappling or ground-wrestling, as Shotokan &quot;karateka&quot; are encouraged to end an encounter with a single attack (&quot;ippon&quot;), avoiding extended periods of conflict, or unnecessary contact in situations where there may be more than one attacker.

&quot;Kaishu ippon kumite&quot; is an additional sparring exercise that is usually introduced for higher grades. This starts in a similar manner to freestyle one-step sparring; the attacker names the attack he/she will execute, attacks with that technique, and the defender blocks and counters the attack. Unlike freestyle one-step sparring, however, the attacker may then be required to block the defender&#x27;s counter-attack and strike back. This exercise is often considered more difficult than either freestyle one-step sparring or free sparring, as the defender typically cannot escape to a safe distance in time to avoid the counter to the counter-attack.

&quot;Kumite&quot; within the dojo often differs from competition &quot;kumite&quot;. In &quot;dojo kumite&quot; any and all techniques, within reason, are valid; punches, knife hand strikes, headbutt, locks, takedowns, kicks, etc. In competition certain regulations apply, certain techniques are valid, and certain target areas, such as the joints or throat, are forbidden. The purpose of competition is to score points through the application of &quot;kumite&quot; principles while creating an exciting and competitive atmosphere, whereas the purpose of training &quot;kumite&quot; in the &quot;dojo&quot; is to be prepared to kill or cripple an opponent in a realistic situation.

==History==

Gichin Funakoshi had trained in both of the popular styles of Okinawan karate of the time: Shōrei-ryū and Shōrin-ryū. After years of study in both styles, Funakoshi created a simpler system that combined the ideals of the two. He never named this system, however, always referring to it simply as &quot;karate.&quot; Funakoshi&#x27;s karate reflects the changes made in the art by Ankō Itosu, including the &quot;Heian/Pinan kata&quot; series. Funakoshi changed the names of some of the &quot;kata&quot; in an effort to make the Okinawan kata names easier to pronounce in the Japanese Honshū dialect.

In 1924, Funakoshi adopted the &quot;Kyū / Dan&quot; rank system and the uniform (&quot;keikogi&quot;) developed by Kano Jigoro, the founder of judo. This system uses colored belts (&quot;obi&quot;) to indicate rank. Originally, karate had only three belt colors: white, brown, and black (with ranks within each). The original belt system, still used by many Shotokan schools, is:

* 8th rising to 4th &quot;kyū&quot;: white
* 3rd rising to 1st &quot;kyū&quot;: brown
* 1st and higher &quot;dan&quot;: black

Funakoshi awarded the first 1st &quot;dan&quot; (初段; &quot;shodan&quot;) Shotokan karate ranks to Tokuda, Hironori Ōtsuka (Otsuka), Akiba, Shimizu, Hirose, Makoto Gima, and Shinyō Kasuya on 10 April 1924.

<text>The World Values Survey (WVS) is a global research project that explores people&#x27;s values and beliefs, how they change over time, and what social and political impact they have. Since 1981 a worldwide network of social scientists have conducted representative national surveys as part of WVS in almost 100 countries.

The WVS measures, monitors and analyzes: support for democracy, tolerance of foreigners and ethnic minorities, support for gender equality, the role of religion and changing levels of religiosity, the impact of globalization, attitudes toward the environment, work, family, politics, national identity, culture, diversity, insecurity, and subjective well-being.

Romano Prodi, former Prime Minister of Italy and the tenth President of the European Commission, said about WVS work:
The growing globalization of the world makes it increasingly important to understand ... diversity. People with varying beliefs and values can live together and work together productively, but for this to happen it is crucial to understand and appreciate their distinctive worldviews.

==Insights==
The WVS has over the years demonstrated that people&#x27;s beliefs play a key role in economic development, the emergence and flourishing of democratic institutions, the rise of gender equality, and the extent to which societies have effective government.

===Inglehart–Welzel cultural map===
Analysis of WVS data made by political scientists Ronald Inglehart and Christian Welzel asserts that there are two major dimensions of cross cultural variation in the world: 
# &quot;Traditional values&quot; versus &quot;secular-rational values&quot; and 
# &quot;Survival values&quot; versus &quot;self-expression values&quot;.
The global cultural map shows how scores of societies are located on these two dimensions. Moving upward on this map reflects the shift from Traditional values to Secular-rational and moving rightward reflects the shift from Survival values to Self-expression values.

&quot;Traditional values&quot; emphasize the importance of religion, parent-child ties, deference to authority and traditional family values. People who embrace these values also reject divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide. These societies have high levels of national pride and a nationalistic outlook.

&quot;Secular-rational values&quot; have the opposite preferences to the traditional values. These societies place less emphasis on religion, traditional family values and authority. Divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide are seen as relatively acceptable.

&quot;Survival values&quot; place emphasis on economic and physical security. It is linked with a relatively ethnocentric outlook and low levels of trust and tolerance.

&quot;Self-expression values&quot; give high priority to environmental protection, growing tolerance of foreigners, gays and lesbians and gender equality, and rising demands for participation in decision-making in economic and political life.

Christian Welzel introduced the concepts of &quot;emancipative values&quot; and &quot;secular values&quot;. He provided measurements for those values using World Values Survey data. Emancipative values are an updated version of self-expression values. Secular values are an updated version of traditional versus secular rational values. The survival versus self-expression values and the traditional versus secular rational values were factors extracted with an orthogonal technique of factor analysis, which forbids the two scales from correlating with each other. The emancipative and secular values are measured in such a way as to represent the data as faithfully as possible even if this results in a correlation between the scales. The secular and emancipative values indices are positively correlated with each other.

====Culture variations====
A somewhat simplified analysis is that following an increase in standards of living, and a transit from development country via industrialization to post-industrial knowledge society, a country tends to move diagonally in the direction from lower-left corner (poor) to upper-right corner (rich), indicating a transit in both dimensions.

However, the attitudes among the population are also highly correlated with the philosophical, political and religious ideas that have been dominating in the country. Secular-rational values and materialism were formulated by philosophers and the left-wing politics side in the French Revolution, and can consequently be observed especially in countries with a long history of social democratic or socialistic policy, and in countries where a large portion of the population have studied philosophy and science at universities. Survival values are characteristic for eastern-world countries and self-expression values for western-world countries. In a liberal post-industrial economy, an increasing share of the population has grown up taking survival and freedom of thought for granted, resulting in that self-expression is highly valued.

====Examples====
* Societies that have high scores in Traditional and Survival values: Zimbabwe, Morocco, Jordan, Bangladesh.
* Societies with high scores in Traditional and Self-expression values: Most of Latin America, Ireland.
* Societies with high scores in Secular-rational and Survival values: Russia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Estonia.
* Societies with high scores in Secular-rational and Self-expression values: Japan, Nordic countries, Benelux, Germany, Switzerland, Czechia, Slovenia, France.

===Gender values===
Findings from the WVS indicate that support for gender equality is not just a consequence of democratization. It is part of a broader cultural change that is transforming industrialized societies with mass demands for increasingly democratic institutions. Although a majority of the world&#x27;s population still believes that men make better political leaders than women, this view is fading in advanced industrialized societies, and also among young people in less prosperous countries.

World Values Survey data is used by the United Nation Development Programme in order to calculate the &quot;gender social norms index.&quot; The index measures attitudes toward gender equality worldwide and was introduced in the Human Development Report starting from 2019. The index has four components, measuring gender attitudes in politics, education and economy as well as social norms related to domestic violence.

===Religion===
The data from the World Values Survey cover several important aspects of people&#x27;s religious orientation. One of them tracks how involved people are in religious services and how much importance they attach to their religious beliefs. In the data from 2000, 98% of the public in Indonesia said that religion was very important in their lives while in China only three percent considered religion very important. Another aspect concerns people&#x27;s attitudes towards the relation between religion and politics and whether they approve of religious spokesmen who try to influence government decisions and people&#x27;s voting preferences.

In a factor analysis of the latest wave (6) of World Values Survey data, Arno Tausch (Corvinus University of Budapest) found that family values in the tradition of Joseph Schumpeter and religious values in the research tradition of Robert Barro can be an important positive asset for society. Negative phenomena, like the distrust in the state of law; the shadow economy; the distance from altruistic values; a growing fatigue of democracy; and the lack of entrepreneurial spirit are all correlated with the loss of religiosity. Tausch based his results on a factor analysis with promax rotation of 78 variables from 45 countries with complete data, and also calculated performance indices for the 45 countries with complete data and the nine main global religious denominations. On this account, Judaism and also Protestantism emerge as most closely combining religion and the traditions of the Enlightenment.

===Happiness and life satisfaction===
The WVS has shown that from 1981 to 2007 happiness rose in 45 of the 52 countries for which long-term data are available. Since 1981, economic development, democratization, and rising social tolerance have increased the extent to which people perceive that they have free choice, which in turn has led to higher levels of happiness around the world, which supports the human development theory.

===Findings===
Some of the survey&#x27;s basic findings are:
# Much of the variation in human values between societies boils down to two broad dimensions: a first dimension of “&quot;traditional vs. secular-rational values&quot;” and a second dimension of “&quot;survival vs. self-expression values&quot;.”
# On the first dimension, traditional values emphasize religiosity, national pride, respect for authority, obedience and marriage. Secular-rational values emphasize the opposite on each of these accounts.
# On the second dimension, survival values involve a priority of security over liberty, non-acceptance of homosexuality, abstinence from political action, distrust in outsiders and a weak sense of happiness. Self-expression values imply the opposite on all these accounts.
# Following the &#x27;revised theory of modernization,&#x27; values change in predictable ways with certain aspects of modernity. People&#x27;s priorities shift from traditional to secular-rational values as their &quot;sense of existential security&quot; increases (or backwards from secular-rational values to traditional values as their sense of existential security decreases).
# The largest increase in existential security occurs with the &quot;transition from agrarian to industrial societies&quot;. Consequently, the largest shift from traditional towards secular-rational values happens in this phase.
# People&#x27;s priorities shift from survival to self-expression values as their &quot;sense of individual agency&quot; increases (or backwards from self-expression values to survival as the sense of individual agency decreases).
# The largest increase in individual agency occurs with the &quot;transition from industrial to knowledge societies&quot;. Consequently, the largest shift from survival to self-expression values happens in this phase.
# The value differences between societies around the world show a pronounced &quot;culture zone pattern&quot;. The strongest emphasis on traditional values and survival values is found in the Islamic societies of the Middle East. By contrast, the strongest emphasis on secular-rational values and self-expression values is found in the Protestant societies of Northern Europe.
# These culture zone differences reflect different &quot;historical pathways&quot; of how entire groups of societies entered modernity. These pathways account for people&#x27;s different senses of existential security and individual agency, which in turn account for their different emphases on secular-rational values and self-expression values.
# Values also differ within societies along such cleavage lines as gender, generation, ethnicity, religious denomination, education, income and so forth.
# Generally speaking, groups whose living conditions provide people with a stronger sense of existential security and individual agency nurture a stronger emphasis on secular-rational values and self-expression values.
# However, the &quot;within&quot;-societal differences in people&#x27;s values are dwarfed by a factor five to ten by the &quot;between&quot;-societal differences. On a global scale, basic living conditions differ still much more between than within societies, and so do the experiences of existential security and individual agency that shape people&#x27;s values.
# A specific subset of self-expression values—&quot;emancipative values&quot;—combines an emphasis on freedom of choice and equality of opportunities. Emancipative values, thus, involve priorities for lifestyle liberty, gender equality, personal autonomy and the voice of the people.
# Emancipative values constitute the key cultural component of a broader process of &quot;human empowerment&quot;. Once set in motion, this process empowers people to exercise freedoms in their course of actions.
# If set in motion, human empowerment advances on three levels. On the socio-economic level, human empowerment advances as growing &quot;action resources&quot; increase people&#x27;s capabilities to exercise freedoms. On the socio-cultural level, human empowerment advances as rising &quot;emancipative values&quot; increase people&#x27;s aspirations to exercise freedoms. On the legal-institutional level, human empowerment advances as widened &quot;democratic rights&quot; increase people&#x27;s entitlements to exercise freedoms.
# Human empowerment is an &quot;entity of empowering capabilities, aspirations, and entitlements&quot;. As an entity, human empowerment tends to advance in virtuous spirals or to recede in vicious spirals on each of its three levels.
# As the cultural component of human empowerment, emancipative values are highly consequential in manifold ways. For one, emancipative values establish a &quot;civic form of modern individualism&quot; that favours out-group trust and cosmopolitan orientations towards others.
# Emancipative values encourage &quot;nonviolent protest&quot;, even against the risk of repression. Thus, emancipative values provide social capital that activates societies, makes publics more self-expressive, and vitalizes civil society. Emancipative values advance entire societies&#x27; civic agency.
# If emancipative values grow strong in countries that are democratic, they help to &quot;prevent movements away from democracy&quot;.
# If emancipative values grow strong in countries that are undemocratic, they help to trigger &quot;movements towards democracy&quot;.
# Emancipative values exert these effects because they encourage mass actions that put power holders under pressures to sustain, substantiate or establish democracy, depending on what the current challenge for democracy is.
# Objective factors that have been found to favour democracy (including economic prosperity, income equality, ethnic homogeneity, world market integration, global media exposure, closeness to democratic neighbours, a Protestant heritage, social capital and so forth) exert an influence on democracy mostly insofar as these factors favour emancipative values.
# Emancipative values do not strengthen people&#x27;s desire for democracy, for the desire for democracy is universal at this point in history. But emancipative values do change the &quot;nature of the desire for democracy&quot;. And they do so in a double way.
# For one, emancipative values make people&#x27;s understanding of democracy more liberal: people with stronger emancipative values emphasize the empowering features of democracy rather than bread-and-butter and law-and-order issues.
# Next, emancipative values make people assess the level of their country&#x27;s democracy more critically: people with stronger emancipative values rather underrate than overrate their country&#x27;s democratic performance.
# Together, then, emancipative values generate a &quot;critical-liberal desire for democracy&quot;. The critical-liberal desire for democracy is a formidable force of democratic reforms. And, it is the best available predictor of a country&#x27;s effective level of democracy and of other indicators of good governance. Neither democratic traditions nor cognitive mobilization account for the strong positive impact of emancipative values on the critical-liberal desire for democracy.
# Emancipative values constitute the single most important factor in advancing the empowerment of women. Economic, religious, and institutional factors that have been found to advance women&#x27;s empowerment, do so for the most part because they nurture emancipative values.
# Emancipative values change people&#x27;s life strategy from an emphasis on securing a decent subsistence level to enhancing human agency. As the shift from subsistence to agency affects entire societies, the overall level of subjective well-being rises.
# The emancipative consequences of the human empowerment process are not a culture-specific peculiarity of the &#x27;West.&#x27; The same empowerment processes that advance emancipative values and a critical-liberal desire for democracy in the &#x27;West,&#x27; do the same in the &#x27;East&#x27; and in other culture zones.
# The social dominance of Islam and individual identification as Muslim both weaken emancipative values. But among young Muslims with high education, and especially among young Muslim women with high education, the Muslim/Non-Muslim gap over emancipative values closes.

A 2013 analysis noted the number of people in various countries responding that they would prefer not to have neighbors of the different race ranged from below 5% in many countries to 51.4% in Jordan, with wide variation in Europe.

According to the 2017-2020 world values survey, 95% of Chinese respondents have significant confidence in their government, compared with the world average of 45% government satisfaction.

==History==
The World Values Surveys were designed to test the hypothesis that economic and technological changes are transforming the basic values and motivations of the publics of industrialized societies. The surveys build on the European Values Study (EVS) first carried out in 1981. The EVS was conducted under the aegis of Jan Kerkhofs and Ruud de Moor and continues to be based in the Netherlands at the Tilburg University. The 1981 study was largely limited to developed societies, but interest in this project spread so widely that surveys were carried out in more than twenty countries, located on all six inhabited continents. Ronald Inglehart of the University of Michigan played a leading role in extending these surveys to be carried out in countries around the world. Today the network includes hundreds of social scientist from more than 100 countries.

The surveys are repeated in waves with intervals of 5 to 10 years. The waves have been carried out in the years listed in this table:

Findings from the first wave of surveys pointed to the conclusion that intergenerational changes were taking place in basic values relating to politics, economic life, religion, gender roles, family norms and sexual norms. The values of younger generations differed consistently from those prevailing among older generations, particularly in societies that had experienced rapid economic growth. To examine whether changes were actually taking place in these values and to analyze the underlying causes, a second wave of WVS surveys was carried out in 1990–91. Because these changes seem to be linked with economic and technological development, it was important to include societies across the entire range of development, from low income societies to rich societies.

A third wave of surveys was carried out in 1995–97, this time in 55 societies and with increased attention being given to analysing the cultural conditions for democracy. A fourth wave of surveys was carried out in 1999–2001 in 65 societies. A key goal was to obtain better coverage of African and Islamic societies, which had been under-represented in previous surveys. A fifth wave was carried out in 2005–07 and a sixth wave was carried out during 2011–12.

Due to the European origin of the project, the early waves of the WVS were eurocentric in emphasis, with little representation in Africa and South-East Asia. To expand, the WVS adopted a decentralised structure, in which social scientists from countries throughout the world participated in the design, execution and analysis of the data, and in publication of findings. In return for providing the data from a survey in their own society, each group obtained immediate access to the data from all participating societies enabling them to analyse social change in a broader perspective.

The WVS network has produced over 300 publications in 20 languages and secondary users have produced several thousand additional publications. The database of the WVS has been published on the internet with free access.

The official archive of the World Values Survey is located in [ASEP/JDS] Madrid, Spain.

==Methodology==
The World Values Survey uses the sample survey as its mode of data collection, a systematic and standardized approach to collect information through interviewing representative national samples of individuals. The basic stages of a sample survey are Questionnaire design; Sampling; Data collection and Analysis.

===Questionnaire design===
For each wave, suggestions for questions are solicited by social scientists from all over the world and a final master questionnaire is developed in English. Since the start in 1981 each successive wave has covered a broader range of societies than the previous one. Analysis of the data from each wave has indicated that certain questions tapped interesting and important concepts while others were of little value. This has led to the more useful questions or themes being replicated in future waves while the less useful ones have been dropped making room for new questions.

The questionnaire is translated into the various national languages and in many cases independently translated back to English to check the accuracy of the translation. In most countries, the translated questionnaire is pre-tested to help identify questions for which the translation is problematic. In some cases certain problematic questions are omitted from the national questionnaire.

===Sampling===
Samples are drawn from the entire population of 18 years and older. The minimum sample is 1000. In most countries, no upper age limit is imposed and some form of stratified random sampling is used to obtain representative national samples. In the first stages, a random selection of sampling points is made based on the given society statistical regions, districts, census units, election sections, electoral roll or polling place and central population registers. In most countries the population size and/or degree of urbanization of these Primary Sampling Units are taken into account. In some countries, individuals are drawn from national registers.

===Data collection and field work===
Following the sampling, each country is left with a representative national sample of its public. These persons are then interviewed during a limited time frame decided by the executive committee of the World Values Survey using the uniformly structured questionnaires. The survey is carried out by professional organizations using face-to-face interviews or phone interviews for remote areas. Each country has a Principal Investigator (social scientists working in academic institutions) who is responsible for conducting the survey in accordance with the fixed rules and procedures. During the field work, the agency has to report in writing according to a specific check-list. Internal consistency checks are made between the sampling design and the outcome and rigorous data cleaning procedures are followed at the WVS data archive. No country is included in a wave before full documentation has been delivered. This means a data set with the completed methodological questionnaire. and a report of country-specific information (for example important political events during the fieldwork, problems particular to the country). Once all the surveys are completed, the Principal Investigator has access to all surveys and data.

===Analysis===
The World Values Survey group works with leading social scientists, recruited from each society studied. They represent a wide range of cultures and perspectives which makes it possible to draw on the insights of well-informed insiders in interpreting the findings. It also helps disseminate social science techniques to new countries.

Each research team that has contributed to the survey analyses the findings according to its hypotheses. Because all researchers obtain data from all of the participating societies, they are also able to compare the values and beliefs of the people of their own society with those from scores of other societies and to test alternative hypotheses. In addition, the participants are invited to international meetings at which they can compare findings and interpretations with other members of the WVS network. The findings are then disseminated through international conferences and joint publications.

===Usage===
The World Values Survey data has been downloaded by over 100,000 researchers, journalists, policy-makers and others. The data is available on the WVS website which contains tools developed for online analysis.

==Governance and funding==
The World Values Survey is organised as a network of social scientists coordinated by a central body - the World Values Survey Association. It is established as a non-profit organization seated in Stockholm, Sweden, with a constitution and mission statement. The project is guided by an executive committee representing all regions of the world. The committee is also supported by a Scientific Advisory Committee, a Secretariat and an Archive. The WVS Executive Committee provides leadership and strategic planning for the association. It is responsible for the recruitment of new members, the organization of meetings and workshops, data processing and distribution, capacity building and the promotion of publications and dissemination of results. The WVS Executive Committee also raises funds for central functions and assists member groups in their fundraising.

Each national team is responsible for its own expenses and most surveys are financed by local sources. However, central funding has been obtained in cases where local funding is not possible. Presently, the activities of the WVS Secretariat and WVS Executive Committee are funded by the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation. Other funding has been obtained from the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), the Volkswagen Foundation, he German Science Foundation (DFG) and the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science.

==Media coverage==
The World Values Survey data has been used in a large number of scholarly publications and the findings have been reported in media such as BBC News, Bloomberg Businessweek, China Daily, Chinadialogue.net, CNN, Der Spiegel, Der Standard, Rzeczpospolita, Gazeta Wyborcza, Le Monde, Neue Zürcher Zeitung, Newsweek, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Time, The Economist, The Guardian, The New Yorker, The New York Times, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Washington Post, and the World Development Report.

==World Values Paper Series: World Values Research==
World Values Research (WVR), registered as , is the official online paper series of the World Values Survey Association. The series is edited by the executive committee of the Association. WVR publishes research papers of high scientific standards based on evidence from World Values Surveys data. Papers in WVR follow good academic practice and abide to ethical norms in line with the mission of the World Values Survey Association. Publication of submitted papers is pending on an internal review by the executive committee of the World Values Survey Association. WVR papers present original research based on data from the World Values Surveys, providing new evidence and novel insights of theoretical relevance to the theme of human values. An archive of published WVR papers is available on the project&#x27;s website.

<doc id="208774" wikidata="Q3068722" url="?curid=208774" title="Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron">
<text>Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron (29 March 1584 – 14 March 1648) was an English politician, peer and military officer who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1614 and 1648. He was a commander in the Parliamentarian army in the English Civil War. His son, Thomas Fairfax, commanded the New Model Army.

==Early life==

He was born in Yorkshire, the eldest son of Ellen Aske and Thomas Fairfax, 1st Lord Fairfax of Cameron, whom Charles I in 1627 created Lord Fairfax of Cameron in the Peerage of Scotland and received a military education in the Netherlands. Two of his brothers were Henry Fairfax and Charles Fairfax. Four others were killed on military service overseas.

==Political career==
He served as member of the English parliament for Boroughbridge during the six parliaments which met between 1614 and 1629 and also during the Short Parliament of 1640. In May 1640 he succeeded his father as Lord Fairfax, but being a Scottish peer he sat in the English House of Commons as one of the representatives of Yorkshire during the Long Parliament from 1640 until his death. He took the side of the parliament, but held moderate views and desired to maintain the peace. His main seat was Denton Hall in Wharfedale, Yorkshire.

==Military service==
In the first Bishops&#x27; War Fairfax had commanded a regiment in the king&#x27;s army; then on the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 he became commander of the parliamentary forces in Yorkshire, with Newcastle as his opponent. Hostilities began after the repudiation of a treaty of neutrality entered into by Fairfax with the Royalists. At first Fairfax met with no success. He was driven from York, where he was besieging the Royalists, to Selby; then in 1643 to Leeds; and after beating off an attack at that place he was totally defeated on 30 June 1643 at the Battle of Adwalton Moor. He escaped to Hull, which he successfully defended against Newcastle from 2 September until 11 October 1643, and by means of a brilliant sally caused the siege to be raised. Fairfax was victorious at Selby on 11 April 1644, and joining the Scots, besieged York, after which he was present at the Battle of Marston Moor (2 July 1644), where he commanded the infantry and was routed. He was subsequently, in July 1644, made Governor of York and charged with the further reduction of the county. In December 1644 he took the town of Pontefract, but failed to secure the castle.

During his command in Yorkshire, Fairfax engaged in a paper war with Newcastle, and wrote &quot;The Answer of Ferdinando, Lord Fairfax, to a Declaration of William, Earl of Newcastle&quot; (1642; printed in Rushworth, pt. iii. vol. ii. p. 139); he also published &quot;A Letter from . . . Lord Fairfax to . . . Robert, Earl of Essex&quot; (1643), describing the victorious sally at Hull.

==Later life==
Fairfax resigned his command on the passing of the Self-denying Ordinance, but remained a member of the Committee for the Government of Yorkshire and was appointed, on 24 July 1645, steward of the manor of Pontefract. He died from an accident which caused gangrene in his foot on 14 March 1648 and was buried at All Saints&#x27; Church, Bolton Percy, in Yorkshire.

==Marriages and issue==
Fairfax married twice. By his first wife, Mary Sheffield, daughter of Edmund Sheffield, 3rd Baron of Sheffield (afterwards 1st Earl of Mulgrave), he had six daughters and two sons: Thomas Fairfax, who succeeded him as the third Lord Fairfax, and Charles, a colonel of horse, who was killed at Marston Moor.

He married his second wife, Rhoda Chapman, widow of Thomas Hussey, in October 1646: they had one child, a daughter Ursula.

<text>Dakotamys is a genus of extinct mammal that lived during the Upper Cretaceous. It shared the world with dinosaurs. This small creature was a member of the also extinct order Multituberculata within the suborder Cimolodonta and was a member of the Paracimexomys group.

The genus &quot;Dakotamys&quot; (&quot;Dakota mouse&quot;) was named by Eaton J.G. in 1995. Dakota refers to the Dakota Formation. &quot;&quot;Paracimexomys&quot; and &quot;Dakotamys&quot;... resemble the Eobaataridae in the structure of the upper and lower molars, with cusps showing a tendency to coalesce, and with ornamentation of grooves and ribs on the molars,&quot; (Kielan-Jaworowska &amp; Hurum, 2001, p. 403).

<text>West Wycombe is a small village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England, famed for its manor houses and its hills. It is west of High Wycombe.

The historic village is largely a National Trust property and receives a large annual influx of tourists, being the site of West Wycombe Park, West Wycombe Caves and the Mausoleum on top of West Wycombe Hill. The Mausoleum and Golden Ball above West Wycombe village are impressive local landmarks, visually dominating the village and local landscape for miles surrounding.

West Wycombe Park, Caves, Mausoleum and St Lawrence&#x27;s Church were all constructed in the mid-18th century by Sir Francis Dashwood, founder of the Dilettanti Society and co-founder of the notorious Hellfire Club.

==History==

=== Early history ===

The hill above West Wycombe (now the site of St Lawrence&#x27;s Church and the Mausoleum) has been continuously inhabited for centuries. A Bronze Age settlement is widely believed to have existed here, and research suggests there was a pagan temple in a similar style to Stonehenge. The earliest known settlement is an Iron Age ditch and rampart contour camp dating from the fourth or fifth century BC. A Roman settlement later occupied West Wycombe Hill, and local historians believe a temple was constructed here (though the exact site remains unknown).

=== The lost village of Haveringdon ===

The next major influence on West Wycombe was the Saxons. The hillside was once again occupied, and the newly established settlement was named &quot;Hæferingdune&quot; (&quot;Hill of Hæfer&#x27;s people&quot; in Old English). The name later evolved into Haveringdon.
The site retained religious importance: a church is said to have been erected by St Birinus (who had become the bishop of the West Saxons in AD 634).

A Norman watch tower is also said to have been built on top of the hill.

Haveringdon&#x27;s population is believed to have been greatly reduced by the Bubonic Plague (Black Death) in the 1340s. By the 18th century the village had been resited in the valley along the Oxford Road, and renamed due to its geographical features and position: &quot;West&quot; because it was west of High Wycombe. Both settlements are in the Wye Valley and the word &quot;Combe&quot; derives from the Old English/Brythonic word for &quot;valley&quot;. According to local records there were just two ratepayers left in Haveringdon in the 19th century.

=== The era of Georgians ===

In the mid 18th century Sir Francis Dashwood commissioned an ambitious project to supply chalk for a three-mile straight road between West Wycombe and High Wycombe, now part of the A40 road, then a prominent trade route between London, Oxford, and Gloucester and onward to South Wales. The local chalk cave which had been in the village since prehistoric times was expanded into an elaborate network of tunnels and passages. The design of the caves was mostly inspired by Dashwood&#x27;s Grand Tour of Italy, Greece and the Ottoman Empire. 
Local villagers, impoverished after a series of harvest failures, were paid a shilling per day to tunnel underground to mine chalk. The caves were all excavated by hand and even today they are viewed as an incredible feat of engineering.
Dashwood&#x27;s family home, West Wycombe House, also underwent major alterations at this time. Although Haveringdon had all but disappeared by then, the church and tower had remained and a centre section was built to join the two together. The Mausoleum was also constructed, based on the design of the Constantine Arch in Rome. The new church was named Saint Lawrence&#x27;s, as it was common for churches built on Pagan sites to have this name. The church and Mausoleum were also built using chalk and flint from the caves.

During this time, Dashwood and other high-powered politicians and society members formed a club then known as &quot;The Knights of St. Francis&quot; (which was later named as the Hellfire Club by a London newspaper). They first used Medmenham Abbey, eight miles away from West Wycombe on the River Thames, but the caves were later used for the club&#x27;s meetings. The club was notorious in its day for orgies and black magic, but had disbanded by 1763 (according to church records). The caves fell into disuse and disrepair.

=== West Wycombe in the 20th century ===

In 1929 West Wycombe village was put up for sale by the Dashwood family to raise cash following that year&#x27;s Wall Street crash. It was bought in its entirety by the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (better known as the Royal Society of Arts, or simply the RSA) as part of the Society&#x27;s &quot;Campaign for the Preservation of Ancient Cottages&quot;. In 1934, after extensive repairs, the Society handed the property over to the National Trust. The National Trust markets this property under the name &#x27;West Wycombe Village and Hill&#x27;. The property features many buildings of architectural value which were built between the 16th and 18th centuries.

Between 1862 and 1958 the village was served by West Wycombe railway station, to the east of the village, on the Chiltern Main Line between London and Birmingham.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s the caves underwent extensive repairs under the auspices of the Dashwood family and turned into a tourist attraction. The profit earned was used to renovate the dilapidated West Wycombe Park. The caves continue to thrive as a popular tourist attraction today and have received over 2 million visitors since their reopening in 1951.

==West Wycombe today==
Although it is on the busy A40, the village centre retains much of its historical charm. It is mainly owned by the National Trust, and so has resisted modernisation. The High Street has a number of &#x27;old-fashioned&#x27; shops (in appearance at least), as well as three pubs, some small offices and a well-used village hall. Just off the High Street is the village primary school (Reception to Year 6), a traditional furniture maker and a band hall. The population is around 1,300.

St Lawrence&#x27;s Church was until the mid 18th century a medieval building. Between 1752 and 1762 it was rebuilt for Sir Francis Dashwood by the architect John Donowell. The interior was inspired by the Temple of the Sun at Palmyra; the church tower is topped by a large golden globe which originally contained seating for eight people.

The Swan is a Grade II listed public house. It is on the Campaign for Real Ale&#x27;s National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors. Built in the 18th century, The Swan was refitted and extended in 1932 by Wheelers Wycombe brewery.

West Wycombe is also a civil parish in Wycombe district.

<text>The Hellfire Caves (also known as the West Wycombe Caves) are a network of man-made chalk and flint caverns which extend 260m underground. They are situated above the village of West Wycombe, at the southern edge of the Chiltern Hills near High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, Southeast England.

They were excavated between 1748 and 1752 for Francis Dashwood, 11th Baron le Despencer (2nd Baronet), founder of the Society of Dilettanti and co-founder of the Hellfire Club, whose meetings were held in the caves. The caves have been operating as a tourist attraction since reopening in 1951.

== Location and layout ==
The caves run into the hillside above West Wycombe village and directly beneath St Lawrence&#x27;s Church and Mausoleum (which were also constructed by Sir Francis Dashwood around the same time the caves were excavated). West Wycombe Park, ancestral seat of the Dashwood family and also a National Trust property, lies directly across the valley. This area can be viewed directly from West Wycombe House.

The unusual design of the caves was much inspired by Sir Francis Dashwood&#x27;s visits to Italy, Greece, Turkey, Syria and other areas of the Ottoman Empire during his Grand Tour. The caves extend underground, with the individual caves or &quot;chambers&quot; connected by a series of long, narrow tunnels and passageways.

A route through the underground chambers proceeds, from the Entrance Hall, to the Steward&#x27;s Chamber and Whitehead&#x27;s Cave, through Lord Sandwich&#x27;s Circle (named after John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich), Franklin&#x27;s Cave (named after Benjamin Franklin, a friend of Dashwood who visited West Wycombe), the Banqueting Hall (allegedly the largest man-made chalk cavern in the world), the Triangle, to the Miner&#x27;s Cave; and finally, across a subterranean river named the Styx, lies the final cave, the Inner Temple, where the meetings of the Hellfire Club were held, and which is said to lie directly beneath the church on top of West Wycombe hill. In Greek mythology, the River Styx separated the mortal world from Hades, and the subterranean position of the Inner Temple directly beneath St Lawrence&#x27;s Church was supposed to signify Heaven and Hell.

== History ==

=== Alteration and extension ===

A chalk mine of supposedly ancient origin is believed to have existed above West Wycombe for centuries.

During the late 1740s, to try to combat local poverty, Sir Francis Dashwood commissioned an ambitious project to supply chalk for a straight three mile (5 km) road between West Wycombe and High Wycombe (then on the busy London-Oxford road, now the A40). Local farm workers, impoverished by a succession of droughts and failed harvests, were employed here.

=== Hellfire Club ===
 Members of a club founded by Sir Francis Dashwood included various politically and socially important 18th-century figures such as William Hogarth, John Wilkes, Thomas Potter and John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. Though not believed to have been a member, Benjamin Franklin was a close friend of Dashwood who visited the caves on more than one occasion. The Hellfire Club had previously used Medmenham Abbey, from West Wycombe on the River Thames, as a meeting place, but the caves at West Wycombe were used for meetings in the 1750s and early 1760s. The club motto was &quot;Fais ce que tu voudras&quot; (Do what thou wilt), a philosophy of life associated with François Rabelais&#x27;s fictional abbey at &quot;Thélème&quot; and later used by Aleister Crowley.

According to Horace Walpole, the members&#x27; &quot;practice was rigorously pagan: Bacchus and Venus were the deities to whom they almost publicly sacrificed; and the nymphs and the hogsheads that were laid in against the festivals of this new church, sufficiently informed the neighbourhood of the complexion of those hermits.&quot;

While it was still operating, Sir Francis&#x27; group was not known as the Hellfire Club - this name was given much later. His club used other names, such as The Brotherhood of St. Francis of Wycombe, Order of Knights of West Wycombe, and The Order of the Friars of St. Francis of West Wycombe.

The gatherings of these powerful men who pantomimed rituals of the Catholic Church also featured drinking and orgies. Active in England in the 18th century were rumours of &quot;highborn Devil-worshippers who mocked Church and religion and whom supped with Satan&quot;.

By the early 1760s, the club was no longer active. A local legend claims that the caves are haunted by Sukie, a young maid who was accidentally killed by people playing a practical joke on her. Others claim that the ghost of Paul Whitehead, the former steward of the Hell Fire Club, has been seen in the caves.

=== Legacy ===
During World War II, plans were made to use the caves as a large air-raid shelter if nearby towns were bombed, but Buckinghamshire&#x27;s rural position meant that High Wycombe and surrounding towns were not an enemy target, and so the plans were not carried out. During the late 1940s and early 1950s the caves were renovated and turned into a local visitor attraction by the late Sir Francis Dashwood (11th Baronet).

Hellfire Caves have had more than 2.5 million visitors since reopening in 1951. The tours take visitors along passages which extend over underground past a series of chambers small to the Banqueting Hall and then to the so-called River Styx and the Inner Temple. According to the local tourist bureau, much of the profit earned by the caves has been donated to charities including the National Trust.

<text>SAP R/3 is the former name of the enterprise resource planning software produced by the German corporation SAP AG (now SAP SE). It is an enterprise-wide information system designed to coordinate all the resources, information, and activities needed to complete business processes such as order fulfillment, billing, human resource management, and production planning.

The current successor software to SAP R/3 is known as SAP S/4HANA.

== History of SAP S/4HANA ==

===Earlier versions===
SAP R/2 was a mainframe-based business application software suite that was very successful in the 1980s and early 1990s. It was particularly popular with large multinational European companies that required soft-real-time business applications, with built-in multi-currency and multi-language capabilities.

===R/3===
With the advent of distributed client–server computing, SAP SE brought out a client–server version of the software called SAP R/3 (the &quot;R&quot; was for &quot;Real-time data processing&quot; and &quot;3&quot; was for &quot;3-tier&quot;: 1) database, 2) application server, and 3) client (SAPgui)). This new architecture is compatible with multiple platforms and operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows or UNIX. This opened up SAP to a whole new customer base.

SAP R/3 was officially launched on 6 July 1992. Various releases of the software were made through the 1990s.

A newer version of the software, with revised technical architecture, was released in 2004, and renamed as SAP ERP Central Component (ECC). SAP came to dominate the large business applications market. The newest version of the product is SAP ECC 6.0 Enhancement Pack 8.

SAP ECC is the core component within the SAP&#x27;s Business Suite (a collection of applications including SAP CRM, SAP SCM and others, alongside the ECC component). SAP ECC contains different, but integrated, functionality within its &quot;modules&quot; e.g. Finance module, HR module, Warehouse Management etc. all within the ECC). The combined complexity of the Business Suite, along with newer in-cloud competitors, has in recent years led SAP to invest heavily in simplification and massively improved system response times, culminating in the announcement of the S/4 Simple Suite in February 2015. S/4 has a single tenant architecture and is being built upon SAP&#x27;s in-memory database technology stack (HANA) and will be available in a choice of in-cloud and on-premises deployment. The classic three-tier and database-agnostic architecture of R/3 is replaced with a two-tier architecture.

== Software organization ==
SAP R/3 was arranged into distinct functional modules, covering the typical functions in a business organization. The most widely used modules were Financials and Controlling (FICO), Human Resources (HR), Materials Management (MM), Sales &amp; Distribution (SD), and Production Planning (PP).

Each module handled specific business tasks on its own, but was linked to the other modules where applicable. For instance, an invoice from the billing transaction of Sales &amp; Distribution would pass through to accounting, where it will appear in accounts receivable and cost of goods sold.

SAP typically focused on best practice methodologies for driving its software processes, but more recently expanded into vertical markets. In these situations, SAP produced specialized modules (referred to as IS or Industry Specific) geared toward a particular market segment, such as utilities or retail.

== Technology ==
SAP based the architecture of R/3 on a three-tier client/server structure:

# Presentation layer (GUI)
# Application layer
# Database layer

===Presentation layer===
SAP allows the IT supported processing of a multitude of tasks which occur in a typical company. The newer SAP ERP software differs from R/3 mainly because it is based on SAP NetWeaver: core components can be implemented in ABAP and in Java and new functional areas are mostly no longer created as part of the previous ERP system, with closely interconnected constituents, but as self-contained components or even systems.

===Application server===
This server contains the SAP applications. In systems with two layers, this server forms part of the database server. Application server can be set up for online users, for background processing, or for both.

An application server is a collection of executables that collectively interpret the ABAP/4 (Advanced Business Application Programming / 4th Generation) programs and manage the input and output for them. When an application server is started, these executables all start at the same time. When an application server is stopped, they all shut down together. The number of processes that start up when you bring up the application server is defined in a single configuration file called the application server profile.
Each application server has a profile that specifies its characteristics when it starts up and while it is running. For example, an application server profile specifies:

* Number of processes and their types
* Amount of memory each process may use
* Length of time a user is inactive before being automatically logged off.

The application layer consists of one or more application servers and a message server. Each application server contains a set of services used to run the R/3 system. Not practical, only one application server is needed to run an R/3 system. But in practice, the services are distributed across more than one application server. This means that not all application servers will provide the full range of services. The message server is responsible for communication between the application servers. It passes requests from one application server to another within the system. It also contains information about application server groups and the current load balancing within them. It uses this information to choose an appropriate server when a user logs onto the system.

The application server exists to interpret ABAP/4 programs, and they only run there. If an ABAP/4 program requests information from the database, the application server will send the request to the database server.

===Security===
Server-to-server communications can be encrypted with the SAP cryptographic library. With the acquisition of relevant parts of SECUDE, SAP was able to provide cryptographic libraries with SAP R/3 for Secure Network Communications and Secure Sockets Layer.

<doc id="208784" wikidata="Q7785234" url="?curid=208784" title="Thirty-year rule">
<text>The thirty-year rule (an informal term) is a rule in the laws of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, and the Commonwealth of Australia that provide that certain government documents will be released publicly thirty years after they were created.

Some other countries&#x27; national archives also adhere to a thirty-year rule for the release of government documents.

== United Kingdom ==
In the United Kingdom, the Public Records Act 1958 stated that:

The closure period was reduced from fifty to thirty years by an amending act of 1967, passed during Harold Wilson&#x27;s government. Among those who had repeatedly urged the scrapping of the fifty-year rule was the historian A. J. P. Taylor.

There were two elements to the rule: the first required that records be transferred from government departments to the Public Record Office (now The National Archives) after thirty years unless specific exemptions were given (by the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Advisory Council on Public Records); the second that they would be opened to public access at the same time unless their release was deemed likely to cause &quot;damage to the country&#x27;s image, national security or foreign relations&quot;.

Significant changes were made to the rules as a consequence of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) (which came into full effect on 1 January 2005). FOIA essentially removed the second of the thirty-year rules (the access one), and replaced it with provisions allowing citizens to request a wide range of information before any time limit has expired; and also removed some of the exemptions which had previously applied at the thirty-year point. After thirty years, records are transferred to The National Archives, and are reviewed under FOIA to see if they should be opened. The only rationale for keeping them closed within The National Archives is if a FOIA exemption applies.

As a result of that change, releases now occur monthly, rather than annually, and include more recent events, rather than only those over thirty years old.

An independent inquiry chaired by Paul Dacre, editor of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, recommended in January 2009 that the last restrictions on the release of information, such as Cabinet minutes, should be reduced to a fifteen-year embargo and phased in over a fifteen-year period.

=== Change to a twenty-year rule ===
Under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010, the UK government started moving towards a twenty-year rule.

Files from 1983 were released in August 2013 rather than January 2014, as would previously have been the case, and files from 1984 were released in January 2014.

There were two releases per year until 2022, when the National Archives received the files from 2001 and 2002, having caught up with the transition.

==Australia==
In Australia, the thirty-year rule applied to Commonwealth (federal) government records, except for Cabinet handbooks (closed for fifty years) and raw census records (closed for 99 years). Those periods were laid down in the &quot;Archives Act 1983&quot;.

In 2009, the Archives Act was amended to reduce the closed period from thirty to twenty years, with Cabinet notebooks reduced from fifty to thirty years. Census records remain closed for 99 years to protect the privacy of individuals.

Cabinet papers for a full year are released on 1 January each year. To reduce the withholding period from 30 to 20 years, two years of cabinet papers, and three years of cabinet notebooks, have been released simultaneously from 2011 until 2020, when the new 20-year period will be reached.

==Ireland==
The Government of Ireland declassifies files in a similar fashion according to the thirty-year rule. In recent years, files relating to the state’s role in the conflict in Northern Ireland known as The Troubles are declassified in late December of each year. 

==Canada==

The Supreme Court of Canada has previously argued in favour of Cabinet confidentiality. In the decision &quot;Babcock v AG Canada&quot; the court explained the reason as:

To preserve this rule of confidentiality, subsection 70(1) of the &quot;Privacy Act&quot; provides that the Act does not apply to confidences of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada. Other notable cases that expand upon the doctrine of cabinet confidentiality include &quot;Canada (Minister of Environment) v. Canada (Information Commissioner), 2003 FCA 68&quot; and &quot;Quinn v. Canada (Prime Minister), 2011 FC 379&quot;. As of 2013, after a time lag of 20 years Canadians can submit access-to-information requests for cabinet records through the Privy Council Office, but this comes at a cost of $5 per request and can take months to process. In May 2018, it was disclosed that the Supreme Court of Canada under Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin had placed a &quot;50-year from the time they rule on a case&quot; embargo on public access to files related to the deliberations of the judges.

According to Archivist Michael Dufresne, it was not until 1940 and the advent of the Second World War that Cabinet kept an agenda and minutes of its deliberations. From 1867 to 1940, a succession of six men served as Clerk of the Privy Council, and their duties included serving as the only institutional memory bank of the Government of Canada. The appointment in 1940 of Arnold Danforth Patrick Heeney as Clerk and as first Secretary to the Cabinet changed the format of memory bank from biological to scriptural. Heeney was surprised upon arrival by the informal ways in which important business was conducted:
Order-in-Council PC 1940-1121 of March 25, 1940 ushered in a significant change in the documentation of government. The Order-in-Council read, in part:
Heeney established procedures and for the first time recorded the minutes and conclusions of a cabinet body – the Cabinet War Committee. In 1942, the Statutory Orders and Regulations Division was set up under PC 7992, 4 September 1942. Also under PC 7992, a registry for maintaining orders and minutes of council, Treasury Board Minutes and other government orders was established. It was not until 1944 that the formal collection of &quot;Cabinet Conclusions&quot; was created.

In the early 1980s, the PCO began a voluntary transfer of cabinet records, which had been declassified after a 30-year holding period, to the National Archives (which became Library and Archives Canada in 2004) where they became publicly available, under the label &quot;Cabinet Conclusions&quot;. After an initial document dump that included records dated from 1937 to 1952, the PCO released the records on an annual basis.

In 2008, two years after Prime Minister Stephen Harper was elected, the tradition of annual voluntary releases of Cabinet Conclusions stopped.

In September 2013 while the Harper government was in power, PCO spokesman Raymond Rivet told a news organisation that the office was &quot;committed&quot; to making government documents and information accessible but that &quot;Processing these records requires a significant investment of resources. We will continue to process and release records as resources permit.&quot;

In May 2017, it came to light that the Government of Canada was under no obligation to release documentary records after a number of years. NDP Member of Parliament (MP) Murray Rankin, a legal scholar, said at the time:
In June 2017, an agreement between the Supreme Court of Canada and Library and Archives Canada arranged for the transfer of case-files under a 50-year rule.

==Israel==
Israel adopted the British model of a thirty-year rule as the basis for reviewing and declassifying its foreign policy documents. Israeli declassification policy is based on the Archives law of 1955. The principle of the law is that all material is to be released after thirty years, subject to limitations based on damage to state security, foreign policy or personal privacy. In practice this means that declassification of documents are fixed at different periods based on type of material and date of production.

The original law has been modified and updated a number of times. Following a 2010 update of the legislation, the office of the Prime Minister released as statement explaining that &quot;the new regulations shorten the period after which non-security-related material may be viewed, from 30 to 15 years, while lengthening the confidentiality period of certain defense-related documents to 70 years in cases in which Israel&#x27;s security conditions require it&quot;.

==Germany==
The German Federal Archives generally makes its holdings available after 30 years. Exceptions are for personnel files, which are opened only 10 years after the death of the individual or 100 years after the person&#x27;s birth if the date of death is unknown, and records dealing with taxation, credit, and banking, which are sealed for 60 years. 

Additionally, Federal Archives holdings originating with the Communist Party and communist organizations of the former German Democratic Republic (East Germany) have been available for decades with almost no limitations. The Federal Archives has also worked to make East German government records available with a minimum of time limitation. In any event, since October 2020, 30 years have passed from the dissolution of the GDR.

<doc id="208786" wikidata="Q1437338" url="?curid=208786" title="Forillon National Park">
<text>Forillon National Park, one of 42 national parks and park reserves across Canada, is located at the outer tip of the Gaspé Peninsula of Quebec and covers .

Created in 1970, Forillon was the first national park in Quebec. The park includes forests, sea coast, salt marshes, sand dunes, cliffs, and the Eastern End of the Appalachians. The word &quot;forillon&quot; is thought to have referred to a flowerpot island or sea stack which used to be a landmark in the area but has since collapsed into the ocean.

==History==
The area was a traditional summer hunting and fishing ground for the Mi&#x27;kmaq and Haudenosaunee people.

This area was once used for its rich supply of wood. People living in L&#x27;Anse-au-Griffon were once involved in the lumber industry here.

The creation of the park in 1970 was preceded by the removal of 225 families through expropriation. When preparing to create the new park, the Government of Canada requested that the Quebec government expropriate the homes of these families. The Quebec government sub-contracted the appropriation and negotiations to a private firm. This firm allegedly used various bullying tactics to scare the residents into agreeing to settlements of reduced value. This stratagem ensured a larger profit margin for the contractor. On 14 February 2011, the House of Commons adopted a motion which issued an official apology to the people whose properties were expropriated to create Forillon Park. The motion read:That this House issue an official apology to the people whose properties were expropriated to create Forillon Park for the unconscionable manner in which they were treated, and that the Speaker of the House send the representatives of the people whose properties were expropriated and of their descendants an official copy of the Journals of the House of Commons indicating the adoption of this motion.
This expropriation is the subject of a song titled &quot;Forillon&quot; by the group Le Vent du Nord on their album Têtu. This song is based on Maurice Joncas&#x27; poem &quot;La complainte de Forillon&quot;, set to music by Pierre Michaud.

==Wildlife==
This national park includes nesting colonies of sea birds and whales, and seals as well as woodland mammalian species which are red fox, black bear, moose, lynx, mink, coyote, woodchuck, porcupine, snowshoe hare, beaver, and ermine. Raptors that inhabit this park are great horned owls, northern harriers, peregrine falcons, kestrels, bald eagles, rough-legged hawks, and ospreys.

==Activities and sights==

Activities at interpretation sites bring visitors to learn more about human and natural life in the Forillon peninsula. The Grande-Grave National Heritage Site attests to the way of life of fishing families. The Hyman Store features collections of articles that were sold at the time, and the store &quot;owners&quot; tell tales of thriving fisheries industry. Close by, the pedestrian walk &quot;Une Tournée dans les Parages&quot; brings visitors around houses, fields and agricultural and commercial installations from the beginning of the twentieth century. Along the shores, whale watching is available.

Forillon encloses the site of Fort Péninsule, near the Penouille beach. This fortification was built during World War II to protect the Gaspé bay, as was Fort Prével on the other side of the bay; had Germany conquered all of Europe, these forts would have sheltered British warships seeking refuge from German submarines. Visitors today can enter a tunnel to see cannon in place since that time.

<text>Black Mask was a pulp magazine first published in April 1920 by the journalist H. L. Mencken and the drama critic George Jean Nathan. It is most well-known today for launching the hardboiled crime subgenre of mystery fiction, publishing now-classic works by Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, Erle Stanley Gardner, Cornell Woolrich, Paul Cain, Carroll John Daly, and others.

== Early years, 1920–26 ==
The magazine was one of several money-making publishing ventures to support the prestigious literary magazine &quot;The Smart Set&quot;, which Mencken edited, and which had operated at a loss since at least 1917. Under their editorial hand, the magazine was not exclusively a publisher of crime fiction, offering, according to the magazine, &quot;the best stories available of adventure, the best mystery and detective stories, the best romances, the best love stories, and the best stories of the occult.&quot; The magazine&#x27;s first editor was Florence Osborne (credited as F. M. Osborne).

After eight issues, Mencken and Nathan considered their initial $600 investment to have been sufficiently profitable, and they sold the magazine to its publishers, Eltinge Warner and Eugene Crow, for $12,500. The magazine was then edited by George W. Sutton (1922–24), followed by Philip C. Cody. Cody had significant interests and expertise in the publishing world serving as Vice President of Warner Publications publishers of such mass market magazines as &quot;Field and Stream&quot;, and pulp genre publications such as &quot;Black Mask&quot;. Under Cody&#x27;s editorship, the content of &quot;Black Mask&quot; became more sensationalist. Cody, who had a keen sense for what appealed to the public marketplace, focused on what had the most reader allure. Under Cody, the stories chosen for publication were longer, more intricately plotted and strewn with more blood, guts, gore and sex. Cody served as both circulation editor and general editor from 1924 to 1926. In 1926, Joseph Shaw took over the editorship.

==Contributing authors==
Early &quot;Black Mask&quot; contributors of note included J. S. Fletcher, Vincent Starrett, and Herman Petersen. Shaw, following up on a promising lead from one of the early issues, promptly turned the magazine into an outlet for the growing school of naturalistic crime writers led by Carroll John Daly. Daly&#x27;s private detective Race Williams was a rough-and-ready character with a sharp tongue, establishing a model for many later acerbic private eyes.

&quot;Black Mask&quot; later published stories by the profoundly influential Dashiell Hammett, creator of Sam Spade and The Continental Op, and other hardboiled writers who came in his wake, such as Raymond Chandler, Erle Stanley Gardner, Paul Cain, Frederick Nebel, Frederick C. Davis, Raoul F. Whitfield, Theodore Tinsley, Todhunter Ballard (as W.T. Ballard), Dwight V. Babcock, and Roger Torrey. The best-known contributors to &quot;Black Mask&quot; were mostly men, but the magazine also published works by many female crime writers, including Marjory Stoneman Douglas, Katherine Brocklebank, Sally Dixon Wright, Florence M. Pettee, Marion O&#x27;Hearn, Kay Krausse, Frances Beck, Tiah Devitt and Dorothy Dunn. Crime fiction made up most of the magazine&#x27;s content, but &quot;Black Mask&quot; also published some Western and general adventure fiction.

The magazine was successful, and many of the writers whose work appeared in its pages, such as Hugh B. Cave, went on to greater commercial and critical success. Writer George Harmon Coxe created &quot;Casey, Crime Photographer&quot;, for the magazine; the character became a media franchise, appearing in novels, films, radio and television programs, comic books, and theatrical productions.

&quot;Black Mask&#x27;s&quot; covers were usually painted by Fred Craft or J. W. Schlaikjer. Shaw gave Arthur Rodman Bowker a monopoly on creating illustrations for the interior of the magazine.

==Decline and revival==
&quot;Black Mask&quot; reached a sales peak in the early 1930s, but then interest began to wane under increasing pressure from radio, the cinema, and rival pulp magazines. In 1936, refusing to cut writers&#x27; already meager pay, Shaw resigned, and many of the high-profile authors abandoned the magazine with him. Shaw&#x27;s successor, Fanny Ellsworth (1936–40), managed to attract new writers to &quot;Black Mask&quot;, including Cornell Woolrich, Frank Gruber, Max Brand and Steve Fisher. However, from the 1940s on, &quot;Black Mask&quot; was in decline, despite the efforts of a new editor, Kenneth S. White (1940–48). The magazine in this period carried the work of John D. MacDonald. Henry Steeger then edited &quot;Black Mask&quot; anonymously until it ceased publication in 1951. In 1953, &quot;Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine&quot; bought Black Mask Magazine, and turned it into a special department which “features harder-edged works of crime, noir, and private-eye writers.” Black Mask ceased to exist in &quot;EQMM&quot; in the 1970s but was reinstated in 2008 and continues to run today.

In 1985, the magazine was revived as &quot;The New Black Mask&quot;, featuring noted crime writers James Ellroy,
Michael Collins, Sara Paretsky and Bill Pronzini, as well as Chandler and Hammett reprints. Edward D. Hoch praised the revived &quot;Black Mask&quot;, stating in the book &quot;Encyclopedia Mysteriosa&quot; that &quot;it came close to reviving the excitement and storytelling pleasure of the great old pulp magazines&quot;. As a result of a legal dispute over the rights to the name &quot;Black Mask&quot;, the magazine ceased publication in 1987. It was revived as a short-lived magazine entitled &quot;A Matter of Crime&quot;.

Original copies of the &quot;Black Mask&quot; are highly valued among pulp magazine collectors. Issues with stories by Chandler and Hammett are especially coveted and command high prices.

In 2016, the magazine, including its copyrights and intellectual property, were acquired by Steeger Properties, LLC. It was relaunched by Altus Press.

Select covers from &quot;Black Mask&quot; were featured as collectable items in the 2020 action-adventure video game &quot;&quot;.
