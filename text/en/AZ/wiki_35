<text>The Battle of Cape Matapan () was a naval battle during the Second World War between the Allies, represented by the navies of the United Kingdom and Australia, and the Royal Italian navy, from 27 to 29 March 1941. Cape Matapan is on the south-western coast of the Peloponnesian peninsula of Greece.

After the interception and decryption of Italian signals by the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) at Bletchley Park (the decrypted intelligence codenamed Ultra), ships of the Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy, under the command of Royal Navy Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham, intercepted and sank or severely damaged several ships of the Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot; under Squadron-Vice-Admiral Angelo Iachino. The opening actions of the battle are also known in Italy as the Battle of [[Gavdos|Gaudo]].

==Background==
In late March 1941, as British ships of the Mediterranean Fleet covered troop movements to Greece, Mavis Batey, a cryptanalyst at Bletchley Park, made a breakthrough, reading the Italian naval Enigma for the first time. The first message, the cryptic &quot;Today’s the day minus three,&quot; was followed three days later by a second message reporting the sailing of an Italian battle fleet comprising one battleship, six heavy and two light cruisers, plus destroyers to attack the merchant convoys supplying British forces. As always with Enigma, the intelligence breakthrough was concealed from the Italians by ensuring there was a plausible, visible reason for the Allies to have detected and intercepted their fleet. In this case, it was a carefully directed reconnaissance plane.

As a further deception, Admiral Cunningham made a surreptitious exit after dark from a golf club in Alexandria to avoid being seen boarding his flagship, the battleship . He had made a point of arriving at the club the same afternoon with his suitcase as if for an overnight stay, and spent some time on the golf course within sight of the Japanese consul. An evening party on his flagship was advertised for that night but was never meant to take place.

At the same time, there was a failure of intelligence on the Axis side. The Italians had been incorrectly informed by the Germans that the British Mediterranean Fleet had only one operational battleship and no aircraft carriers. In fact the Royal Navy had three battleships, while the damaged British aircraft carrier had been replaced by .

==Prelude==
===Opposing forces===
The Allied force was the British Mediterranean fleet, consisting of the aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Formidable&quot; and three s, , , and . The main fleet was accompanied by the 10th Destroyer Flotilla ( and , and , commanded by Commander &quot;Hec&quot; Waller, RAN), and the 14th Destroyer Flotilla (, , , and , commanded by Philip Mack); also present were and . Force B, under Admiral Sir Henry Pridham-Wippell, consisted of the British light cruisers , , and , the Australian light cruiser , and the British destroyers , , and . The Australian had returned to Alexandria. Allied warships attached to convoys were available: , , and waited in the Kithira Channel and , , , and and were nearby.

The Italian fleet was led by Admiral Iachino&#x27;s flagship, the modern battleship , screened by destroyers &quot;Alpino&quot;, &quot;Bersagliere&quot;, &quot;Fuciliere&quot;, and &quot;Granatiere&quot; of the 13th Flotilla. The fleet also included most of the Italian heavy cruiser force: , , and , accompanied by four destroyers (, , , and ) of the 9th Flotilla; and the heavy cruisers , , and , accompanied by three destroyers (&quot;Ascari&quot;, &quot;Corazziere&quot;, and &quot;Carabiniere&quot;) of the 12th Flotilla. Joining them were the light cruisers and (8th division) and two destroyers of the 16th Flotilla ( and ) from Brindisi. Significantly, none of the Italian ships had radar, unlike several of the Allied ships.

==Battle==
On 27 March, Vice-Admiral Pridham-Wippell—with the cruisers &quot;Ajax&quot;, &quot;Gloucester&quot;, &quot;Orion&quot; and &quot;Perth&quot; and a number of destroyers—sailed from Greek waters for a position south of Crete. Admiral Cunningham with &quot;Formidable&quot;, &quot;Warspite&quot;, &quot;Barham&quot; and &quot;Valiant&quot; left Alexandria on the same day to meet the cruisers.

The Italian fleet was spotted by a Sunderland flying boat at 12:00, depriving Iachino of any advantage of surprise. The Italian admiral also learned that &quot;Formidable&quot; was at sea, thanks to the decryption team aboard . Nevertheless, after some discussion, the Italian headquarters decided to go ahead with the operation, to show the Germans their will to fight and confidence in the higher speed of their warships.

===Action off Gavdos===
On 28 March, an IMAM Ro.43 floatplane launched by &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; spotted the British cruiser squadron at 06:35. At 07:55, the &quot;Trento&quot; group encountered Admiral Pridham-Wippell&#x27;s cruiser group south of the Greek island of Gavdos. The British squadron was heading to the south-east. Thinking they were attempting to run from their larger ships, the Italians gave chase, opening fire at 08:12 from . The three heavy cruisers fired repeatedly until 08:55, with &quot;Trieste&quot; firing 132 armour-piercing rounds, &quot;Trento&quot; firing 204 armour-piercing and 10 explosive shells and &quot;Bolzano&quot; firing another 189 armour piercing shells, but the Italians experienced trouble with their rangefinding equipment and scored no significant hits. HMS &quot;Gloucester&quot; fired three salvos in return. These fell short but did cause the Italians to make a course change.

As they had not reduced the distance significantly after an hour of pursuit, the Italian cruisers broke off the chase, turning to the north-west on a course to rejoin &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;. The Allied ships changed course in turn, following the Italian cruisers at extreme range. Iachino allowed the British approach in the hope of luring them within the range of &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;″s guns.

An officer on &quot;Orion&quot;″s bridge remarked to a companion, &quot;What&#x27;s that battleship over there? I thought ours were miles away.&quot; The Italians eavesdropped on &quot;Orion&quot;″s signal that she had sighted an unknown unit and was going to investigate. At 10:55, &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; joined the Italian cruisers and immediately opened fire on the shadowing Allied cruisers. She fired 94 rounds in 29 salvos from a distance of , all well aimed, but again with an excessive dispersal of her salvos. (Another 11 rounds got jammed in the barrels.) The Allied cruisers, until then unaware of the presence of a battleship, withdrew, suffering slight damage from shell fragments. A series of photographs taken from HMS &quot;Gloucester&quot; showing Italian salvos falling amongst Allied warships was published by &quot;Life&quot; magazine on 16 June 1941.
===Air attacks===

Cunningham&#x27;s force, which had been attempting to rendezvous with Pridham-Wippell, launched an attack by Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers from HMS &quot;Formidable&quot; at 09:38. They attacked &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; without direct effect, but the required manoeuvring made it difficult for the Italian ships to maintain their pursuit. The Italian ships fired 152, 100 and 90 mm guns and also 37, 20 and 13.2 mm guns when at close range, repelling the attack, while one of the two Junkers Ju 88s escorting the Italian fleet was shot down by a Fairey Fulmar. Iachino broke off the pursuit at 12:20, retiring towards his own air cover at Taranto.

A second aerial attack at 15:09 surprised the Italians; Lieutenant-Commander John Dalyell-Stead (DSO) was able to fly his Albacore to within 1,000m of &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; before releasing a torpedo which hit her outer port propeller and caused of flooding. Dalyell-Stead and his crew were killed when their aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft fire from the battleship. The ship stopped while the damage was repaired, but she was able to get under way again at 16:42, making . Cunningham heard of the damage to &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;, and started a pursuit.
A third attack by six Albacores and two Fairey Swordfish of 826 and 828 Naval Air Squadrons from &quot;Formidable&quot; and two Swordfish of 815 squadron from Crete took place between 19:36 and 19:50. Admiral Iachino deployed his ships in three columns and used smoke, searchlights, and a heavy barrage to protect &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;. The tactics prevented further damage to the battleship, but one torpedo hit &quot;Pola&quot;, which had nearly stopped to avoid running into &quot;Fiume&quot; and could not take any evasive action. This blow knocked out five boilers and the main steam line, causing &quot;Pola&quot; to lose electric power and drift to a stop. The torpedo was apparently dropped by Lieutenant Grainger Williams. Williams was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, primarily for the part he played in bringing about the ensuing naval engagement.

Unaware of Cunningham&#x27;s pursuit, a squadron of cruisers and destroyers was ordered to return and help &quot;Pola&quot;. This squadron included &quot;Pola&quot;″s sister ships, &quot;Zara&quot; and &quot;Fiume&quot;. The squadron did not start to return towards &quot;Pola&quot; until about an hour after the order had been given by Iachino, officially due to communication problems, while &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; and the other ships continued to Taranto.

===Night action===
At 20:15, &quot;Orion&quot;″s radar picked up a ship six miles to port, apparently dead in the water; she was the crippled &quot;Pola&quot;. The bulk of the Allied forces detected the Italian squadron on radar shortly after 22:00, and were able to close without being detected. The Italian ships had no radar and could not detect British ships by means other than sight; Italian thinking did not envisage night actions and their main gun batteries were not prepared for action. At 22:20 they spotted the Allied squadron, but thought them to be Italian ships. The battleships &quot;Barham&quot;, &quot;Valiant&quot;, and &quot;Warspite&quot; were able to close to – point blank range for battleship guns – at which point they opened fire. The Allied searchlights (including those under the command of Midshipman Prince Philip aboard &quot;Valiant&quot;) illuminated their enemy. The aircraft carrier &quot;Formidable&quot; also joined the main battleline, although only fired 1 salvo from her 4.5 inch guns before pulling back to safety.Some British gunners saw main turrets flying dozens of metres into the air from the Italian cruisers. &quot;Fiume&quot; and &quot;Zara&quot; were destroyed in minutes. &quot;Fiume&quot; sank at 23:30, while &quot;Zara&quot; was finished off by a torpedo from the destroyer HMS &quot;Jervis&quot; at 02:40 of 29 March.

Two Italian destroyers, &quot;Vittorio Alfieri&quot; (flagship of the flotilla commander, Captain Salvatore Toscano) and &quot;Giosuè Carducci&quot;, were sunk in the first five minutes. The other two, &quot;Gioberti&quot; and &quot;Oriani&quot;, managed to escape in a smoke screen, the former with heavy damage, after being chased and fired at by the British destroyers &quot;Griffin&quot; and &quot;Greyhound&quot;. Towing &quot;Pola&quot; to Alexandria as a prize was considered, but daylight was approaching, and it was thought that the danger of enemy air attack was too high. British boarding parties seized a number of much-needed Breda anti-aircraft machine guns. &quot;Pola&quot;″s crew was taken off and she was sunk by torpedoes from the destroyers &quot;Jervis&quot; and &quot;Nubian&quot; shortly after 04:00. The only known Italian reaction after the shocking surprise was a fruitless torpedo charge by &quot;Oriani&quot; and &quot;Gioberti&quot; and the aimless fire of one of &quot;Zara&quot;″s 40 mm guns in the direction of the British warships.

The Allied ships took on survivors but left the scene in the morning, fearing Axis air strikes. Admiral Cunningham ordered a signal to be made on the Merchant Marine emergency band. This signal was received by the Italian High Command. It informed them that, due to the risk of air strikes, the Allied ships had ceased their rescue operations and granted safe passage to a hospital ship for rescue purposes. The location of the remaining survivors was broadcast, and the Italian hospital ship &quot;Gradisca&quot; came to recover them. Allied casualties during the battle were a single torpedo bomber shot down by &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;″s 90 mm (3.5-inch) anti-aircraft batteries, with the loss of the three-man crew. Italian losses were up to 2,303 sailors, most of them from &quot;Zara&quot; and &quot;Fiume&quot;. The Allies rescued 1,015 survivors, while the Italians saved another 160.

==Aftermath==
===Balance of naval power===
The naval historian Vincent O&#x27;Hara described the Battle of Matapan as &quot;Italy&#x27;s greatest defeat at sea, subtracting from its order of battle a cruiser division, but the battle was hardly decisive.&quot; The British in the Mediterranean lost the heavy cruiser and the new light cruiser &quot;Bonaventure&quot; in the same period (26–31 March 1941), but while the Royal Navy lost four heavy cruisers during the war (&quot;York&quot;, , and , the latter two in a single engagement), at Matapan the Regia Marina lost three in a night. That the Italians had sortied so far to the east established a potential threat that forced the British to keep their battleships ready to face another sortie during the operations off Greece and Crete.

After the defeat at Cape Matapan, the Italian Admiral Iachino wrote that the battle had

The Italian fleet did not venture into the Eastern Mediterranean again until the fall of Crete two months later and it did not come out in full force until the Battle of mid-June 1942. Despite his impressive victory, Admiral Cunningham was somewhat disappointed with the failure of the destroyers to make contact with &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;. The fact that the Italian battleship had escaped intact was, in the words of the British admiral, &quot;much to be regretted&quot;.

===Bletchley Park (GC&amp;CS)===
For reasons of secrecy, code breakers at the GC&amp;CS were very rarely informed of the operational effects of their work, but their impact on the Battle of Cape Matapan was an exception. A few weeks after the battle, Admiral Cunningham visited Bletchley Park to congratulate codebreaker Dilly Knox and his staff, with a positive impact on morale: Mavis Batey, one of the code breakers, remembers: &quot;Our sense of elation knew no bounds when Cunningham himself came down in person to thank and congratulate us&quot;. Admiral John Godfrey, the Director of Naval Intelligence, stated: &quot;Tell Dilly that we have won a great victory in the Mediterranean and it is entirely due to his girls&quot;.

===Post war===
There is still controversy in Italy regarding the orders given by the Italian Admiral Angelo Iachino to the &quot;Zara&quot; division to recover the &quot;Pola&quot;, when it was clear that an enemy battleship force was approaching rapidly from the opposite direction.

For decades after the end of the Second World War, the involvement of the GC&amp;CS, as well as the code-breaking methods used, were kept secret. A number of controversial theories were published before more complete accounts emerged after records were eventually declassified in 1978. Only later, after Dilly&#x27;s rodding method was demonstrated by Mavis Batey to the Admiral in charge of naval history, were Italian official records corrected. In 1966, H. Montgomery Hyde published a story alleging that an American spy, Betty Thorpe, had seduced Admiral Alberto Lais (the Italian naval attaché in Washington, D.C.), and that she had obtained a codebook used by the British to defeat the Italians at Matapan. Hyde was found guilty of libelling the dead, but evidence of GC&amp;CS involvement was not made public at that time. In 1980, the BBC series &quot;Spy!&quot; included similar allegations about a spy called &#x27;Cynthia&#x27; who obtained a codebook. In 1974, Frederick Winterbotham in &quot;The Ultra Secret&quot; falsely credited the decryption of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Enigma traffic.

<text>A seventh chord is a chord consisting of a triad plus a note forming an interval of a seventh above the chord&#x27;s root. When not otherwise specified, a &quot;seventh chord&quot; usually means a dominant seventh chord: a major triad together with a minor seventh. However, a variety of sevenths may be added to a variety of triads, resulting in many different types of seventh chords.

In its earliest usage, the seventh was introduced solely as an embellishing or nonchord tone. The seventh destabilized the triad, and allowed the composer to emphasize movement in a given direction. As time passed and the collective ear of the western world became more accustomed to dissonance, the seventh was allowed to become a part of the chord itself, and in some modern music, jazz in particular, . Additionally, the general acceptance of equal temperament during the 19th century reduced the dissonance of some earlier forms of sevenths.

== Classification ==
Most textbooks name these chords &quot;formally&quot; by the type of triad and type of seventh; hence, a chord consisting of a major triad and a minor seventh above the root is referred to as a major/minor seventh chord. When the triad type and seventh type are identical (i.e. they are both major, minor, or diminished), the name is shortened. For instance, a &quot;major/major&quot; seventh is generally referred to as a major seventh. This rule is not valid for augmented chords: since the augmented/augmented chord is not commonly used, the abbreviation &quot;augmented&quot; is used for &quot;augmented/minor&quot;, rather than &quot;augmented/augmented&quot;. Additionally, &quot;half-diminished&quot; stands for &quot;diminished/minor&quot;, and &quot;dominant&quot; stands for &quot;major/minor&quot;. When the type is not specified at all, the triad is assumed to be major, and the seventh is understood as a minor seventh (e.g. a &quot;C&quot; chord is a &quot;C major triad&quot;, and a &quot;C7&quot; chord is a &quot;C major/minor seventh chord&quot;, also known as a &quot;C dominant seventh chord&quot;). For symbols used for seventh chords, see also .

=== Tertian ===

The most common chords are tertian, constructed using a sequence of major thirds (spanning 4 semitones) and/or minor thirds (3 semitones). Since there are 3 third intervals in a seventh chord (4 notes) and each can be major or minor, there are 7 possible permutations (the 8th one, consisted of four major thirds, results in a non-seventh augmented chord, since a major third equally divides the octave). The five commonly found in western music are the major seventh, the minor (or minor/minor) seventh, the dominant (or major/minor) seventh, the half-diminished seventh, and the diminished seventh. The less commonly found tertians are the minor major seventh and the augmented major seventh.

=== Non-tertian ===

Seventh chords can also be constructed using augmented or diminished thirds. These chords are not tertian and can be used in non-tertian harmony. There are many (mathematically, 64) chords that can be built, however, only a few of them are used in Western music.

In tuning systems other than equal temperament there are further possible seventh chords. In just intonation, for example, there is the harmonic seventh.

== Types ==

=== Dominant seventh chord ===

A dominant seventh chord, or major-minor seventh chord is a chord composed of a root, major third, perfect fifth -- a major triad -- with an additional minor seventh. It is denoted using popular music symbols by adding a superscript &quot;7&quot; after the letter designating the chord root. The dominant seventh is found almost as often as the dominant triad. The chord can be represented by the integer notation (0, 4, 7, 10).

Of all the seventh chords, perhaps the most important is the dominant seventh. It was the first seventh chord to appear regularly in classical music. The name comes from the fact that the flat seventh occurs naturally in the scale built upon the root when it functions as the dominant (i.e., the fifth degree) of some major diatonic scale.

Take for example the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C):&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \clef treble 
 \time 7/4 c4 \once \override NoteHead.color = #red d e \once \override NoteHead.color = #red f \once \override NoteHead.color = #red g a \once \override NoteHead.color = #red b \time 4/4 c1 \bar &quot;||&quot;
 \time 4/4 &lt;d, f g b&gt;2 &lt;g b d f&gt; \bar &quot;||&quot;
&lt;/score&gt;

The note G is the dominant degree of C major—its fifth note. When we arrange the notes of the C major scale in ascending pitch and use only these notes to build a seventh chord, and we start with G (not C), then the resulting chord contains the four notes G–B–D–F and is called G dominant seventh (G7). The note F is a minor seventh from G, and is also called the dominant seventh with respect to G.

=== Harmonic seventh chord ===

The harmonic seventh chord is a dominant seventh chord formed by a major triad plus a harmonic seventh interval.

The harmonic seventh interval is a minor seventh tuned in the 7:4 pitch ratio, one of the possible &quot;just ratios&quot; defined for this interval in just intonation (slightly below the width of a minor seventh as tuned in equal temperament). With just intonation on all notes of the harmonic seventh chord, the ratio between the frequencies of the pitches in the chord is 4:5:6:7. For example, a justly intuned A harmonic seventh chord in root position starting at A440 consists of the pitches 440 Hz, 550 Hz, 660 Hz, and 770 Hz.

Sometimes called a &quot;blue note&quot;, the harmonic seventh is used by singers, through note bending on guitars, and on other instruments not restricted to equal temperament. An often heard example of the harmonic seventh chord is the last word of the modern addition to the song &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot;, with the lyrics, &quot;and many more!&quot; The harmony on the word &quot;more&quot; is typically sung as a harmonic seventh chord.

Frequent use of the harmonic seventh chord is one of the defining characteristics of blues and barbershop harmony; barbershoppers refer to it as &quot;the barbershop seventh&quot;. Since barbershop music tends to be sung in just intonation, the barbershop seventh chord may be accurately termed a harmonic seventh chord. The harmonic seventh chord is also widely used in blues-flavored music. As pianos, and other equal-temperament instruments cannot play this chord, it is frequently approximated by a dominant seventh. As a result, it is often called a dominant seventh chord and written with the same symbols (such as the blues progression I7–V7–IV7).

=== Major and minor seventh chords ===

While the dominant seventh chord is typically built on the fifth (or dominant) degree of a major scale, the minor seventh chord is built on the second, third, or sixth degree. A minor seventh chord contains the same notes as an added sixth chord. For example, C–E–G–B can function as both a C minor seventh and an E added sixth (Id chord).
Major seventh chords are usually constructed on the first or fourth degree of a scale, (in C or G major: C–E–G–B). Due to the major seventh interval between the root and seventh (C–B, an inverted minor second), this chord can sometimes sound dissonant, depending on the voicing used. For example, Bacharach and David&#x27;s &quot;Raindrops Keep Fallin&#x27; on My Head&quot; opens with a major chord followed by a major seventh in the next measure.

The major seventh is sometimes notated as 7 (a delta chord) or just a (which has the same meaning).

=== Half-diminished seventh chord ===

A half-diminished seventh chord is a seventh chord built from the seventh degree of a major scale. It is considered &quot;half-diminished&quot; because a fully diminished seventh has a double-flatted (diminished) seventh, making it enharmonically the same as a major sixth. The half-diminished seventh chord uses a minor seventh over the root of a diminished triad.

Example: (in the key of C major) B–D–F–A.

=== Diminished seventh chord ===
A diminished seventh chord is made of three superimposed minor thirds (e.g., B–D–F–A), which is two tritones a minor third apart (e.g., B–F, D–A). The diminished seventh chord has been used by composers and musicians for a variety of reasons over time. Some reasons include: as a symbol of Sturm und Drang; modulation; and for characterisation. The diminished seventh chord is seen more frequently in late classical and romantic period works but is also found in Baroque and Renaissance period works, though not as frequently.

All of the elements of the diminished seventh chord can be found in the dominant seventh flat nine (79) chord as seen in a comparison of the two chords.

There are four different inversions of a seventh chord. Following basso continuo notation, the inversions are as follows:

*: GBDF
*: BDFG
*: DFGB
* or : FGBD
Additional numbers are used to indicate the seventh chords and their inversions.

<doc id="203451" wikidata="Q9747038" url="?curid=203451" title="Orders of magnitude (time)">
<text>An order of magnitude of time is usually a decimal prefix or decimal order-of-magnitude quantity together with a base unit of time, like a microsecond or a million years. In some cases, the order of magnitude may be implied (usually 1), like a &quot;second&quot; or &quot;year&quot;. In other cases, the quantity name implies the base unit, like &quot;century&quot;. In most cases, the base unit is seconds or years.

Prefixes are not usually used with a base unit of years. Therefore, it is said &quot;a million years&quot; instead of &quot;a megayear&quot;. Clock time and calendar time have duodecimal or sexagesimal orders of magnitude rather than decimal, e.g., a year is 12 months, and a minute is 60 seconds.

The smallest meaningful increment of time is the Planck time―the time light takes to traverse the Planck distance, many decimal orders of magnitude smaller than a second.

The largest realized amount of time, based on known scientific data, is the age of the universe, about 13.8 billion years—the time since the Big Bang as measured in the cosmic microwave background rest frame. Those amounts of time together span 60 decimal orders of magnitude. Metric prefixes are defined spanning to , 60 decimal orders of magnitude which may be used in conjunction with the metric base unit of second.

Metric units of time larger than the second are most commonly seen only in a few scientific contexts such as observational astronomy and materials science, although this depends on the author. For everyday use and most other scientific contexts, the common units of minutes, hours (3,600 s or 3.6 ks), days (86,400 s), weeks, months, and years (of which there are a number of variations) are commonly used. Weeks, months, and years are significantly variable units whose lengths depend on the choice of calendar and are often not regular even with a calendar, e.g., leap years versus regular years in the Gregorian calendar. This makes them problematic for use against a linear and regular time scale such as that defined by the SI, since it is not clear which version is being used.

Because of this, the table below does not include weeks, months, and years. Instead, the table uses the annum or astronomical Julian year (365.25 days of 86,400 seconds), denoted with the symbol a. Its definition is based on the average length of a year according to the Julian calendar, which has one leap year every four years. According to the geological science convention, this is used to form larger units of time by the application of SI prefixes to it; at least up to giga-annum or Ga, equal to 1,000,000,000 a (short scale: one billion years, long scale: one milliard years).

==Less than one second==
== More than one second ==

In this table, large intervals of time surpassing one second are catalogued in order of the SI multiples of the second as well as their equivalent in common time units of minutes, hours, days, and Julian years.

<text>The Sputnik crisis was a period of public fear and anxiety in Western nations about the perceived technological gap between the United States and Soviet Union caused by the Soviets&#x27; launch of &quot;Sputnik 1&quot;, the world&#x27;s first artificial satellite. The crisis was a significant event in the Cold War that triggered the creation of NASA and the Space Race between the two superpowers. The satellite was launched on October 4, 1957, from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. This created a crisis reaction in national newspapers such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which mentioned the satellite in 279 articles between October 6, 1957, and October 31, 1957 (more than 11 articles per day).

==Background==
In the early 1950s, Lockheed U-2 spy plane flights over the Soviet Union provided intelligence that the US held the advantage in nuclear capability. However, an education gap was identified when studies conducted between 1955 and 1961 reported that the Soviet Union was training two to three times as many scientists per year as the US. The launch and orbit of &quot;Sputnik 1&quot; suggested that the Soviet Union had made a substantial leap in technology, which was interpreted as a serious threat to US national security, spurring the US to boost federal investment in research and development, education, and national security. The Juno I rocket that carried the first US satellite Explorer 1 was ready to launch in 1956, but that fact was classified and unknown to the public. The Army&#x27;s PGM-19 Jupiter from which Juno was derived had been shelved on the orders of Defense Secretary Charles Erwin Wilson amid interservice rivalry with the US Air Force&#x27;s PGM-17 Thor rocket.

==Launch==

The Soviets used ICBM technology to launch Sputnik into space, which gave them two propaganda advantages over the US at once: the capability to send the satellite into orbit and proof of the distance capabilities of their missiles. That proved that the Soviets had rockets capable of sending nuclear weapons to Western Europe and even North America. That was the most immediate threat that &quot;Sputnik 1&quot; posed. The United States, a land with a history of geographical security from European wars because of its distance, suddenly seemed vulnerable.

A contributing factor to the Sputnik crisis was that the Soviets had not released a photograph of the satellite for five days after the launch. Until then, its appearance remained a mystery to Americans. Another factor was its weight of , compared to US plans to launch a satellite of . The Soviet claim seemed outrageous to many American officials, who doubted its accuracy. US rockets then produced of thrust, and US officials presumed that the Soviet rocket that launched Sputnik into space must have produced of thrust. In fact, the R-7 rocket that launched &quot;Sputnik 1&quot; into space produced almost of thrust. All of those factors contributed to the Americans&#x27; perception that they were greatly behind the Soviets in the development of space technologies.
Hours after the launch, the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign Astronomy Department rigged an &quot;ad hoc&quot; interferometer to measure signals from the satellite. Donald B. Gillies and Jim Snyder programmed the ILLIAC I computer to calculate the satellite orbit from this data. The programming and calculation was completed in less than two days. The rapid publication of the ephemeris (orbit) in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; within a month of the satellite launch helped to dispel some of the fears created by the Sputnik launch. However, Sputnik was not part of an organized effort to dominate space according to a Soviet space scientist.

The successful launch of &quot;Sputnik 1&quot; and then the subsequent failure of the first two Project Vanguard launch attempts greatly accentuated the US perception of a threat from the Soviet Union that had persisted since the Cold War had begun after World War II. The same rocket that launched Sputnik could send a nuclear warhead anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes, which would strip the Continental United States of its oceanic defenses. The Soviets had demonstrated that capability on 21 August by a test flight of the R-7 booster. The event was announced by TASS five days later and was widely reported in other media.

== Eisenhower&#x27;s reaction ==
Five days after the launch of &quot;Sputnik 1&quot;, the world&#x27;s first artificial satellite, US President Dwight Eisenhower addressed the American people. After being asked by a reporter on security concerns about the Soviet satellite, Eisenhower said, &quot;Now, so far as the satellite itself is concerned, that does not raise my apprehensions, not one iota.&quot;

Eisenhower made the argument that Sputnik was only a scientific achievement and not a military threat or change in world power. He believed that Sputnik&#x27;s weight &quot;was not commensurate with anything of great military significance, and that was also a factor in putting it in [proper] perspective&quot;.

In 1958, Eisenhower declared three &quot;stark facts&quot; the United States needed to confront:
* The Soviets had surpassed America and the rest of the &quot;free world&quot; in scientific and technological advancements in outer space.
* If the Soviets maintained that superiority, they might use it as a means to undermine America&#x27;s prestige and leadership.
* If the Soviets became the first to achieve significantly superior military capability in outer space and created an imbalance of power, they could pose a direct military threat to the US.

Eisenhower followed this statement by saying that the United States needed to meet these challenges with &quot;resourcefulness and vigor&quot;. The president also noted the importance of education for the Russians in their recent scientific and technological progress, and for America&#x27;s response to the Russians. He remarked, &quot;we need scientists in the ten years ahead...scrutinize your school&#x27;s curriculum and standards. Then decide for yourselves whether they meet the stern demands of the era we are entering.&quot; His ability to project confidence about the situation was limited because his confidence was based on clandestine reconnaissance, so he failed to quell the fears that there was a shift in power between the Americans and Soviets. The launch of &quot;Sputnik 1&quot; also impacted Eisenhower&#x27;s ratings in his polls, but he eventually recovered.

== Media and political influences ==

The media stirred a moral panic by writing sensational pieces on the event. In the first and second days following the event, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the launch of &quot;Sputnik 1&quot; was a major global propaganda and prestige triumph for Russian communism. Further, Fred Hechinger, a noted American journalist and education editor, reported, “hardly a week passed without several television programs examining education&quot;. It was after the people of the United States were exposed to a multitude of news reports that it became a &quot;nation in shock&quot;. The media not only reported public concern but also created the hysteria. Journalists greatly exaggerated the danger of the Soviet satellite for their own benefit. On October 9, 1957, science fiction writer and scientist Arthur C. Clarke said that the day that Sputnik orbited around the Earth, the US became a second-rate power.

Politicians used the event to bolster their ratings in polls. Research and development was used as a propaganda tool, and Congress spent large sums of money on the perceived problem of US technological deficiency. After the launch of &quot;Sputnik 1&quot; national security advisers overestimated the Soviets&#x27; current and potential rocket strength, which alarmed portions of Congress and the executive branch. When these estimations were released, Eisenhower was forced into an accelerated missile race to appease those concerned with America&#x27;s safety. Sputnik provoked Congress into taking action on improving the US standing in the fields of science.

Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, reflected on the event by saying, &quot;It always sounded good to say in public speeches that we could hit a fly at any distance with our missiles. Despite the wide radius of destruction caused by our nuclear warheads, pinpoint accuracy was still necessary – and it was difficult to achieve&quot;. At the time, Khrushchev stated that &quot;our potential enemies cringe in fright&quot;. The political analyst Samuel Lubell conducted research on public opinion about Sputnik and found &quot;no evidence at all of any panic or hysteria in the public&#x27;s reaction&quot;, which confirmed that it was an elite, not a popular, panic.

== Response ==
=== United States ===
The launch spurred a series of US initiatives ranging from defense to education. Increased emphasis was placed on the US Navy&#x27;s Project Vanguard to launch an American satellite into orbit. There was a renewed interest in the existing Explorer program, which launched the first American satellite into orbit on January 31, 1958. In February 1958, Eisenhower authorized formation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency, which was later renamed to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), within the Department of Defense (DoD) to develop emerging technologies for the US military. On July 29, 1958, he signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, the creation of NASA.

Less than a year after the Sputnik launch, Congress passed the National Defense Education Act (NDEA). It was a four-year program that poured billions of dollars into the US education system. In 1953, the government spent $153 million, and colleges took $10 million of that funding, but by 1960, the combined funding grew almost six-fold because of the NDEA. After the initial public shock, the Space Race began, which led to the first human launched into space, Project Apollo, and the first humans to land on the Moon in 1969.

Campaigning in 1960 on closing the &quot;missile gap&quot;, Eisenhower&#x27;s successor, John F. Kennedy, promised to deploy 1,000 Minuteman missiles. That was many more ICBMs than the Soviets had at the time. Though Kennedy did not favor a massive US crewed space program when he was in the US Senate during Eisenhower&#x27;s term, public reaction to the Soviet&#x27;s launch of the first human into orbit, Yuri Gagarin, on April 12, 1961, led Kennedy to raise the stakes of the Space Race by setting the goal of landing men on the Moon. Kennedy claimed, &quot;If the Soviets control space they can control the earth, as in past centuries the nation that controlled the seas dominated the continents.&quot; Eisenhower disagreed with Kennedy&#x27;s goal and referred to it as a &quot;stunt&quot;. Kennedy had privately acknowledged that the space race was a waste of money, but he knew there were benefits from a frightened electorate. The Space Race was less about its intrinsic importance and more about prestige and calming the public.

The Sputnik crisis sparked the American drive to retake the lead in space exploration from the Soviets, and it fueled its drive to land men on the Moon. American officials had a variety of opinions at the time, some registering alarm and others dismissing the satellite. Gerald Ford, a Republican US representative from Michigan, had stated, &quot;We Middle Westerners are sometimes called isolationists. I don&#x27;t agree with the label; but there can be no isolationists anywhere when a thermonuclear warhead can flash down from space at hypersonic speed to reach any spot on Earth minutes after its launching&quot;. Former US Rear Admiral Rawson Bennett, chief of naval operations, stated that Sputnik was a &quot;hunk of iron almost anybody could launch&quot;, while former US Army general James M. Gavin described it as &quot;the most significant military event of our time&quot;.

The Sputnik crisis also spurred substantial transformation in the US science policy, which provided much of the basis for modern academic scientific research. Astronomer John Jefferies, at the High Altitude Observatory in 1957, recalled that it had received funding mostly from philanthropists. &quot;The week after Sputnik went up, we were digging ourselves out of this avalanche of money that suddenly descended&quot; from the federal government, he said. By the mid-1960s, NASA was providing almost 10% of the federal funds for academic research.

Further expansion was made in the funding and research of space weapons and missile defense in the form of anti-ballistic missile proposals. Education programs were initiated to foster a new generation of engineers and support was dramatically increased for scientific research. Congress increased the National Science Foundation (NSF) appropriation for 1959 to $134 million, almost $100 million higher than the year before. By 1968, the NSF budget stood at nearly $500 million.

According to Marie Thorsten, Americans experienced a &quot;techno-other void&quot; after the Sputnik crisis and still express longing for &quot;another Sputnik&quot; to boost education and innovation. In the 1980s, the rise of Japan (both its car industry and its 5th generation computing project) served to fan the fears of a &quot;technology gap&quot; with Japan. After the Sputnik crisis, leaders exploited an &quot;awe doctrine&quot; to organize learning &quot;around a strong model of educational national security: with math and science serving for supremacy in science and engineering, foreign languages and cultures for potential espionage, and history and humanities for national self-definition&quot;. US leaders were not able to exploit the image of Japan as effectively, despite its representations of super-smart students and a strong economy.

===United Kingdom===
In Britain, the launch of the first Sputnik provoked surprise, combined with elation at experiencing the dawn of the Space Age. It was also a reminder of the decline in the British Empire&#x27;s world influence. The crisis soon became part of the broader Cold War narrative. The &quot;Daily Express&quot; predicted that &quot;The result will be a new [U.S.] drive to catch up and pass the Russians in the sphere of space exploration. Never doubt for a moment that America will be successful&quot;. The crisis contributed to the US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement of 1958.

<doc id="203455" wikidata="Q368732" url="?curid=203455" title="Eliyahu M. Goldratt">
<text>Eliyahu Moshe Goldratt (March 31, 1947 – June 11, 2011) was an Israeli business management guru. He was the originator of the Optimized Production Technique, the Theory of Constraints (TOC), the Thinking Processes, Drum-Buffer-Rope, Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) and other TOC derived tools.

He was the author of several business novels and non-fiction works, mainly on the application of the theory of constraints to various manufacturing, engineering, and other business processes.

The processes are typically modeled as resource flows, the constraints typically represent limits on flows. In his book &quot;The Goal&quot;, the protagonist is a manager in charge of a troubled manufacturing operation. At any point in time, one particular constraint (such as inadequate capacity at a machine tool) limits total system throughput, and when the constraint is resolved, another constraint becomes the critical one. The plot of Goldratt&#x27;s stories revolve around identifying the current limiting constraint and raising it, which is followed by finding out which is the next limiting constraint. Another common theme is that the system being analyzed has excess capacity at a number of non-critical points, which, contrary to conventional wisdom, is essential to ensure constant operation of the constrained resource.

==Life==

Goldratt was born into a rabbinic family, the son of Avraham-Yehuda Goldrat, in British Mandatory Palestine one year prior to Israel&#x27;s modern statehood. He obtained a BSc degree from Tel Aviv University, and MSc and PhD degrees from Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan, Israel. Goldratt died from complications arising from lung cancer on June 11, 2011 in his home in Israel.

==Work==

===Creative Output years===

After some experience helping Israeli manufacturers, Goldratt left the academic world to join a company called Creative Output. The company developed and sold a software package, the Optimized Production Technology (OPT). OPT was billed as the first software to provide finite capacity scheduling for production environments. This software and the principles behind it were analyzed by a number of major publications

Goldratt was actively involved in many controversies such as Cost Accounting v Throughput Accounting and culminated in the publication of &quot;A Town Without Walls&quot;.

Within the company, Goldratt noticed elements that made him uncomfortable. For instance, in the second edition of &quot;The Goal&quot; several software implementations did not come close to their estimated potential. After some work, Goldratt discovered that the habits and assumptions (paradigms) of employees and managers prior to using the software were still prominent and negatively influenced results after implementation.

His answer was the book &quot;The Goal&quot; that took 13 months to write. After completion, the book was not well received by the company staff and by large publishers. Finally, with help from Larry Gadd, the owner of North River Press, the book was published and became a great success. After a while, Goldratt noticed that many implementations were conducted using the book but not the software. This caused further stress in the company and Goldratt tried to capture the essence of how to implement the solution directly in what is now known as Drum-Buffer-Rope method. He published &quot;The Race&quot; to explain some of the concepts he was working on and developed a course to teach people how to manage their production using a computer simulation game.

Goldratt tried to move the company down the path of &quot;consulting,&quot; trying to help people rethink the way they did things, but Creative Output&#x27;s declining revenues and Goldratt&#x27;s involvement with things other than the sales of OPT software convinced the shareholders to fire Goldratt (and afterward his closer collaborators).

===Avraham Y. Goldratt Institute years===

After leaving Creative Output circa 1985, Goldratt created the Avraham Y Goldratt Institute or AGI (named after his father) to promote the Theory of Constraints and help it be implemented worldwide.

During the time of the AGI, Goldratt got deeply involved with the further development of TOC, mainly the Thinking Processes (launching it publicly in 1991), Critical Chain Project Management and other applications. His concepts influenced applications outside manufacturing and supply management, including the field of sales process engineering.

In 1997, Goldratt followed his plan to retire from the Institute prior to his 50th birthday.

===Goldratt Group years===

From the beginning of the 2000s, Goldratt created the self-funded Goldratt Group and launched the Viable Vision initiative.

He continued the development of TOC both in the Goldratt Group and in active support for other developments like TOC for Education, TOC in Healthcare, TOC for the Individual (in the continuity of the Odyssey Program, and the publishing of &quot;The Choice&quot;).

<text>Port Vale Football Club are a professional football club based in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, England, which compete in , the fourth tier of the English football league system. Vale are named after the valley of ports on the Trent and Mersey Canal. They have never played top-flight football, and hold the record for the most seasons in the English Football League (113) without reaching the first tier. After playing at the Athletic Ground in Cobridge and The Old Recreation Ground in Hanley, the club returned to Burslem when Vale Park was opened in 1950. Outside the ground is a statue of Roy Sproson, who played 842 competitive games for the club. The club&#x27;s traditional rivals are Stoke City, and games between the two are known as the Potteries derby.

After becoming one of the more prominent football clubs in Staffordshire, Burslem Port Vale were invited to become founder members of the Football League Second Division in 1892. They spent 13 non-consecutive seasons in the division, punctuated by two seasons in the Midland League before they resigned due to financial difficulties and entered liquidation in 1907. The name of Port Vale continued in the North Staffordshire Federation League, and this new club was successful enough to be reinstated into the Football League in 1919. They spent 16 non-consecutive seasons in the Second Division, punctuated by winning the Third Division North title in 1929–30, before dropping back into the third tier for a much longer stay at the end of the 1935–36 campaign. The 1953–54 season saw manager Freddie Steele&#x27;s &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; defence win both a Third Division North title and a semi-final place in the FA Cup. They failed to build on this success, however, although they went on to finish as champions of the first Fourth Division season under Norman Low&#x27;s stewardship in 1958–59.

The club had little success throughout the 1960s and 1970s, despite being briefly managed by Stanley Matthews, and were forced to apply for re-election after breaking FA rules on illegal payments in 1968. Gordon Lee guided the club to promotion back to the Third Division the following season, where they would remain until relegation at the end of the 1977–78 campaign. John McGrath steered the club to promotion in 1982–83, though he departed after relegation became inevitable the following season. His assistant, John Rudge, became the club&#x27;s longest-serving and most successful manager, leading the club from 1983 to 1999. Under his leadership Port Vale won promotions in 1985–86, 1988–89 and 1993–94, lifted the Football League Trophy in 1993 and reached a post-war record finish of eighth in the second tier in the 1996–97 season.

After Rudge&#x27;s reign ended, the club entered a decline, slipping into the fourth tier whilst twice entering administration in 2003 and 2012. The decline was arrested when manager Micky Adams achieved automatic promotion from League Two in the 2012–13 season, though they were relegated back into League Two at the end of the 2016–17 season after a failed experiment with a continental staff and playing style. Carol Shanahan bought the club in 2019 and manager Darrell Clarke secured promotion out of the League Two play-offs at the end of the 2021–22 season, though they were relegated at the end of the 2023–24 season.

==History==

The official story reported on the club website is that Port Vale F.C. was formed in 1876, following a meeting at Port Vale House, from where the club was supposed to have taken its name. However, documented evidence of football from that era is exceptionally scarce and research by historian Jeff Kent indicated that it was probably formed in 1879 as an offshoot of Porthill Victoria F.C. and took its name from the valley of canal ports where the team played. In the club&#x27;s early days the team played their football at Limekiln Lane, Longport and from 1880 at Westport. The club moved to Moorland Road in Burslem in 1884, changing its name to Burslem Port Vale in the process, though stayed in Burslem for just one year before both turning professional and moving to Cobridge to play at the Athletic Ground. In 1892, the club were invited to become founder members of the Football League Second Division after proving themselves a strong club in the Midland League. They spent 13 seasons in the Second Division, either side of a two-season return to the Midland League (1896–97 and 1897–98).

The club were forced to resign from the league at the end of the 1906–07 season and were subsequently liquidated. However, the name of Port Vale was continued after ambitious minor league side Cobridge Church opted to change their name. The new club subsequently moved into their new home of the Old Recreation Ground in Hanley in 1912. They returned to the Football League in October 1919, taking over the fixture list of Leeds City in the Second Division, who were forced to disband because of financial irregularities. Wilf Kirkham made his Vale debut in October 1923, and over the next ten years would score a club record 164 league and cup goals, including a club record 41 goals in the 1926–27 campaign.

The club were relegated for the first time at the end of the 1928–29 season, going from the Second Division to the Third Division North. They came up as champions the following season and in the 1930–31 season were placed fifth in the second tier of English football, their highest ever league finish. Vale went to beat Chesterfield by a club record 9–1 margin on 24 September 1932. However, after these achievements, the club were once again relegated in the 1935–36 season and remained in the third tier until World War II.

Port Vale moved into their new home of Vale Park in 1950, and a year later Freddie Steele was appointed club manager. Steele quickly established himself at the club, masterminding the celebrated &#x27;Iron Curtain&#x27; defence. The 1953–54 season saw Vale winning the Third Division North title as well as reaching the semi-finals of the FA Cup, losing out to eventual winners West Bromwich Albion in controversial fashion, in which an Albert Leake goal was disallowed for offside. Three years later, the club were again relegated, and once again became founder members of a division – this time the Football League Fourth Division. Manager Norman Low instilled an attacking philosophy and in the 1958–59 season guided the team to the Fourth Division title with a club record 110 goals scored.

Vale ended a six-season stay in the Third Division with relegation at the end of the 1964–65 campaign. In 1967, former Ballon d&#x27;Or winner Stanley Matthews succeeded Jackie Mudie as manager. However, he resigned a year later after Vale were expelled from the Football League for allegedly making illegal payments to players in contravention of FA rules – this punishment was reduced on appeal to a re-election vote, which the club won. Gordon Lee took the helm following this punishment, and steered the club to promotion at the end of the 1969–70 campaign. However, the 1970s did not prove a successful period for the Valiants, as the club languished in the bottom half of the Third Division for much of the decade. Lee left in 1974, and a succession of managers failed to prevent relegation in 1977–1978. The 1979–80 season saw Port Vale finish 20th in the Fourth Division (88th overall), the club&#x27;s worst ever finish. Despite this poor finish in John McGrath&#x27;s first season, they eventually achieved their first success in thirteen years in 1982–83 by winning promotion out of the Fourth Division in third place.

Following McGrath&#x27;s dismissal, his assistant John Rudge was appointed manager in December 1983. Though he was unable to halt Vale&#x27;s immediate return to the bottom tier of the Football League, he succeeded in steadying the ship. Helped by the goals of prolific Welshman Andy Jones, Vale were promoted back to the third tier in 1985–86 after losing just once at Vale Park in the league all season. A major cup upset came on 30 January 1988, when Vale defeated First Division side Tottenham Hotspur 2–1, thanks to a superb strike from Ray Walker. After three seasons in the third tier, Rudge&#x27;s Vale achieved another promotion in 1988–89 after Robbie Earle scored the winning goal at Vale Park to complete a 2–1 aggregate play-off final victory over Bristol Rovers; this marked the club&#x27;s return to the Second Division after a 33-year absence.

Vale suffered relegation on the final day of the 1991–92 league campaign, and though they bounced back well by staying in the promotion picture for most of the 1992–93 season, they narrowly missed out as runners-up to local rivals Stoke City after being overtaken by Bolton Wanderers on the final day. Instead Vale would visit Wembley twice in just over a week. They firstly ran out as 2–1 winners against Stockport County in the final of the Football League Trophy. However, they then lost 3–0 in the play-off final to West Bromwich Albion. Vale recovered from this setback and went on to confirm promotion as runners-up on the final day of the 1993–94 season. During the 1995–96 season, Vale recorded one of their greatest FA Cup giant killings when they defeated holders Everton 2–1. The team also had some success in the Anglo-Italian Cup, as they qualified for the final at Wembley, where they lost 5–2 to the Italian Serie B side Genoa. Vale made a slow start to the 1996–97 campaign, with protests forming against chairman Bill Bell, and the sale of Steve Guppy to Leicester City for £800,000. Despite this, Rudge masterminded an eighth-place finish – their highest in the pyramid since 1931.

In 1997–98, relegation was avoided on the final day of the season with a 4–0 win over Huddersfield Town, at the expense of Manchester City and Stoke City. The next season was another struggle. John Rudge was controversially sacked in January 1999. He was replaced by former player Brian Horton, who spent big to secure the club&#x27;s second consecutive final-day escape from relegation. There was no avoiding relegation in 1999–2000, though, as they were some thirteen points short of safety. Horton led the club to Football League Trophy success in 2001, as Marc Bridge-Wilkinson and Steve Brooker scored the goals to secure a 2–1 victory over Brentford in the final at the Millennium Stadium. In December 2002, Bill Bell called in the administrators, with the club around £1.5 million in debt.

The club came out of administration in 2003–04 under a fan-ownership consortium headed by Bill Bratt&#x27;s Valiant 2001 consortium. However, Horton left in February 2004, unwilling to accept the financial cutbacks imposed by the new board, and was replaced by former player Martin Foyle. Foyle was dismissed in November 2007, and his successor, Lee Sinnott, proved unable to prevent the club from being relegated into League Two after a 23rd-place finish and also oversaw a defeat to Southern League Division One Midlands club Chasetown in the FA Cup. Sinnott was sacked in September 2008 and following an unsuccessful tenure from Dean Glover, Micky Adams was appointed as the club&#x27;s new manager in June 2009. Adams left the club in December 2010 with Vale second in the table and Jim Gannon was selected to finish the promotion job. However, Gannon&#x27;s turbulent reign ended after 74 days. Adams returned as manager at the end of the 2010–11 campaign, but this was not enough to appease fans who demanded a change in the boardroom after a series of promised investments failed to come to fruition.

Genuine hopes of promotion in 2011–12 were brought to an end after the club was issued with a winding up petition by HM Revenue and Customs on 29 February 2012; the club were by this time unable to pay tax bills, creditors, or staff wages. The club entered administration on 9 March. The club finally exited administration on 20 November 2012, and Tom Pope scored 33 goals to fire Vale to promotion back to League One with a third-place finish. They stabilised in the division under new boss Rob Page, before chairman Norman Smurthwaite orchestrated the departure of Page and his squad in favour of the club&#x27;s first foreign manager, Bruno Ribeiro, in June 2016. The result was relegation back into League Two at the end of the 2016–17 season, after which Smurthwaite resigned as chairman. He returned to the role the following season and threatened to put the club into administration if a buyer was not found by May 2019, a fate which was avoided when Carol and Kevin Shanahan completed their takeover. Manager Darrell Clarke returned from close family bereavement to lead Vale through the League Two play-off semi-finals at the end of the 2021–22 season. Promotion was secured with a 3–0 victory over Mansfield Town in the final. Clarke was sacked on 17 April 2023, and was succeeded by his assistant Andy Crosby. They reached the quarter-finals of the League Cup for the first time during the 2023–24 season. Crosby was sacked in February, and was replaced by Darren Moore. However, Port Vale were relegated to League Two at the end of the season.

==Club identity==
Around November 1920, club chairman Frank Huntbach came up with the nickname of &quot;the Valiants&quot;. The following year the club adopted their familiar white and black strip after having experimented with numerous colours, including plain red, gold and black stripes, claret and blue, and even during 1898–1902 playing in the red and white stripes now used by rivals Stoke City for over a century. However, the kit soon changed to plain red shirts with white shorts in 1923, a style which lasted until 1934, when the white shirt, black shorts and socks kit was re-adopted. Between 1958 and 1963, the club adopted various gold and black designs before once again returning to the black-and-white theme.

The initial club crest was modelled on the coat of arms of the Borough of Burslem. From 1952 to 1956 the club used a Staffordshire knot with the letters &quot;PVFC&quot; inside it. Four years later a more complex badge emerged, again based on the Burslem coat of arms but this time also featuring the scythe of the Tunstall arms, the fretted cross of Audley, and two Josiah Wedgwood pots. The crest was removed in 1964, and replaced by a &#x27;P.V.F.C.&#x27; monogramme, which in turn was abandoned in 1978. For the next four years the club switched to a design of a knight on a horse with the text &quot;Port Vale&quot; at the top. From 1982 the club introduced a design based on that of a schoolchild who won a competition, which featured a bottle oven and the Stafford knot, associated with the city of Stoke-on-Trent&#x27;s pottery industry and the history of the local area. The current crest was introduced in February 2013, which was a modern rehash of the crest the club introduced in 1956; it included local historical references: the Portland Vases representing Josiah Wedgwood, the Scythe coming from the house crest of the Sneyd family and the silver cross appearing from the house crest of the Audley family, as well as the Stafford knot above the crest.

==Grounds==
When they joined the English Football League in 1892, Port Vale played at their fourth home ground. They began at the Meadows in Limekiln Lane, Longport, now Scott Lidgett Road, and then moved on to Westport Meadows in 1881, where they played for three years. An area prone to flooding, today Westport Lake now lies where the ground once stood. In 1884, the club moved to the Burslem Football and Athletic ground, where they would stay for just two years. Located close to Burslem railway station, the club took the area&#x27;s name. The first match was a 6–0 win over Everton in a friendly and the ground also hosted FA Cup matches for the first time. It proved to be inadequate however. Port Vale moved on to the Athletic Ground. Located opposite the church on Waterloo Road, directly on the Hanley and Burslem tram line, it played host to the club for 27 years, including twelve Football League seasons. It was so named as it also hosted athletics.

The Old Recreation Ground was Vale&#x27;s home from 1913 to 1950 and was located in Hanley, standing on what is now the multi-storey car park for the Potteries Shopping Centre. The club endured hard financial times during World War II and sold the ground to the council, who were reluctant to allow the club to rent it back. The club received £13,500 for the ground, which they needed to pay off a £3,000 debt.

Vale Park has been Port Vale&#x27;s home ground since 1950; it is located on Hamil Road, opposite Burslem Park. Originally planned to be as massive as an 80,000-capacity stadium, the development was known as the &quot;Wembley of the North&quot;. However, the £50,000 project opened at a capacity of 40,000 (360 seated), which is still highly ambitious. The capacity was increased to a sell-out of 49,768 for an FA Cup tie with Aston Villa in 1960. The stadium underwent numerous upgrades after Bill Bell was elected as chairman in 1987, who aimed to make it &quot;fit for the Premiership&quot;. Outside the ground is a statue to Roy Sproson, who played 842 competitive games for the club.

==Rivalries and supporters==
The club has a fierce rivalry with Stoke City, as City are based in the town of Stoke-upon-Trent. Stoke and Vale first met on 2 December 1882 and played out a total of 44 Football League games up until 10 February 2002, when the two clubs last met in the Second Division; Stoke won the first match 1–0, whilst Vale were 1–0 victors in the latest encounter.

Port Vale also maintain a fiery rivalry with Crewe Alexandra, which has taken on greater significance since Stoke were promoted to a higher league than Vale at the end of the 2001–02 season. One study in 2019 ranked the Port Vale-Stoke City rivalry as the joint-28th biggest rivalry in English professional football, with the Port Vale-Crewe Alexandra game being the 14th biggest rivalry. Vale also maintain rivalries with Shrewsbury Town and Walsall, as well as less significant rivalries with Burton Albion, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Macclesfield Town.

The club&#x27;s official matchday programme was voted the best in League Two in 2010–11. Supporters also produced three unofficial fanzines. The oldest are &quot;The Memoirs of Seth Bottomley&quot; printed in the 1990s but now defunct and the &quot;Vale Park Beano&quot;, which has been printed since 1997; the Beano took its name as a dig at Stoke&#x27;s stadium being constructed partially with the funding of the local council. &quot;Derek I&#x27;m Gutted!&quot; is also a long-running fanzine, and has been printed since August 2000; the name was inspired by a remark by then-manager Brian Horton to local journalist Derek Davis following a defeat to Tranmere Rovers. The &quot;OneValeFan&quot; fansite is the largest independent Port Vale website and has been running since 1996; it was originally titled &quot;There&#x27;s only one Vale fan in Bristol?&quot; in reference to founder Rob Fielding&#x27;s location. The &quot;Ale and the Vale&quot; podcast won the Real EFL League One Podcast of the Year award in 2023.
The club&#x27;s most famous supporter is singer Robbie Williams, raised in Stoke-on-Trent. Before administration in 2012, he was a major shareholder, having bought £240,000 worth of available shares in the club in February 2006. For this investment, a restaurant at Vale Park is named after him. For the football game &quot;FIFA 2000&quot;, he provided an original theme song with &quot;It&#x27;s Only Us&quot;, on the condition that Port Vale should be included in the game, which they were, located in the Rest of World section. This song was also featured on the only FIFA Soundtrack CD release by EMI. In 2005 Williams founded Los Angeles Vale F.C., a Super Metro League team in the United States, named after Port Vale and based at his L.A. home. His best friend, TV presenter Jonathan Wilkes, is also a Vale fan. Another famous fan is darts legend Phil Taylor; Burslem born, &quot;The Power&quot; is a 16-time world champion of the sport. The singer Simon Webbe was signed up to the club&#x27;s youth team as a teenager until a torn ligament at age seventeen put an end to any sporting ambitions. The children&#x27;s illustrator and author Bob Wilson, is also a fan. His &quot;Stanley Bagshaw&quot; series of books is set in an area based on Stoke, and the protagonist supports a thinly disguised version of the Vale; even basing a book on their 1954 Cup run – albeit with a successful conclusion.

==Records and statistics==

Port Vale&#x27;s highest Football League finish was fifth place in the Second Division (second tier) in 1930–31, whilst their best FA Cup finish saw them reach the semi-finals in 1953–54. In the 2023–24 season, they reached the quarter-finals of the League Cup for the first time. Port Vale&#x27;s largest Football League victory was a 9–1 win over Chesterfield in the Second Division in 1932, while the heaviest loss was 10–0 to Sheffield United in 1892 in the same division. Other club record scorelines include a 16–0 victory over Middlewich in a friendly in 1884 and a 12–0 defeat to Aston Villa in the Staffordshire Senior Cup in 1891.

The record for the most appearances for Port Vale is held by Roy Sproson, who played 842 matches in all competitions. Sproson also holds the record for the most league appearances for the club, with 760. His nephew, Phil Sproson, made 500 appearances in all competitions. Wilf Kirkham is the club&#x27;s top goalscorer with 164 goals in all competitions, which includes 153 in the league and 11 in the FA Cup. Kirkham&#x27;s tally of 41 goals in the 1926–27 season is also a club record. Tom Pope and Martin Foyle have also scored more than 100 goals for the club. The first player to be capped at the international level while playing for Vale was Teddy Peers when he made his debut for Wales. The most capped player is Chris Birchall, who earned 27 caps for Trinidad and Tobago while at the club. The first Vale player to score in an international match was Sammy Morgan, who scored for Northern Ireland against Spain on 16 February 1972.

The club&#x27;s highest attendance at Vale Park is 49,768 against Aston Villa in the FA Cup on 20 February 1960, whilst the lowest is 554 against Middlesbrough U21 in the EFL Trophy on 16 October 2018. The highest transfer fee received for a Vale player is £2,000,000 from Wimbledon for Gareth Ainsworth on 29 October 1998, while Ainsworth was also the most expensive player bought, costing £500,000 from Lincoln City on 11 September 1997. The youngest player to play for the club is Nelson Agho, who was aged 15 years and 262 days on his debut against Walsall in the EFL Trophy on 13 November 2018. The oldest player is Tom Holford, who played his last match aged 46 years and 68 days against Derby County in the Second Division on 5 April 1924.

Tom Morgan was the first Port Vale manager to win a league title with the club, taking them to the top of the Third Division North at the end of the 1929–30 season. Freddie Steele repeated the feat during the 1953–54 campaign, also taking the club to the semi-finals of the FA Cup. He was followed by Norman Low, who led Vale to the Fourth Division title in 1958–59. Gordon Lee (1969–70), John McGrath (1982–83), Micky Adams (2012–13) and Darrell Clarke (2021–22) also secured promotions. John Rudge led the club to three promotions – 1985–86, 1988–89 and 1993–94 – as well as a Football League Trophy title in 1993. His successor, Brian Horton also secured a Football League Trophy final victory in 2001.

<text>Breskens is a harbour town on the Westerschelde in the municipality of Sluis, Netherlands. Its population is 4,787 ().

The town is noted for the &quot;Visserijfeesten&quot; (Fishery Festival), the largest festival in Zeeland.

A ferry connection exists between Breskens and Vlissingen. After the opening of the Western Scheldt Tunnel near Terneuzen in 2003, the ferry now only carries pedestrian and bicycle traffic.

== Sights ==

The lighthouse of Breskens is the oldest remaining cast-iron lighthouse in the Netherlands. It was built in 1867 and became a monument in 1982.

== History ==

In early 1487 Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, granted the coastal region of the Scheldt as a fief to Philip of Cleves. The coastal areas were drained and the village of Breskens was founded in 1510.

On 14 May 1940, with the German army approaching, the Dutch government fled to London. Queen Wilhelmina initially ordered the British captain removing her from The Hague to set sail for Breskens from where she wished to lead the resistance against the invading armies. One of the reasons was that Breskens, having two fortresses in the vicinity, could be well defended.
She was advised by the captain that he was under orders not to make contact with the Dutch shore as it was under heavy air attack, so Wilhelmina took the decision reluctantly to go to Britain, planning to return as soon as possible.

On 11 September 1944, during Operation Switchback, the town was carpet-bombed by Allied forces, leaving very little of the historical centre intact. After the war, the town was rebuilt and became a centre for the Dutch fish industry and other maritime-related businesses.

In the nineties, with the fish-industry in terminal decline, tourism became the main economic focus and a number of high-rise apartment blocks were built on the waterfront.

Prior to 1 January 2003, the town was incorporated in the municipality of Oostburg.

<text>IJmuiden () is a port city in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is the main town in the municipality of Velsen which lies mainly to the south-east. Including its large sea locks, it straddles the mouth of the North Sea Canal to Amsterdam. To the south it abuts a large reserve of plant-covered dunes, the Zuid-Kennemerland National Park. The city is on the south bank; the north bank is otherwise a steel plant and Velsen-Noord.

It is north northwest of Haarlem which is due west of Amsterdam.

The port is a deepwater port suited to fully laden Panamax ships, and the fourth port of the Netherlands.

The internal capitalization within IJmuiden is as [[IJ (digraph)|IJ]] is a digraph in modern Dutch with an exceptional spelling convention. Also, in some typefaces, &quot;IJ&quot; is recognised as a ligature and is placed in one typed or handwritten space.

==History==
In the Roman era, the district was already inhabited, and archaeological finds at the impoldered lake of Wijkermeer indicate there was a North Sea port of some regional importance built here. Present day IJmuiden includes four harbors: the &quot;vissershaven&quot; (Ship&#x27;s code IJM), a fishing dock (visafslag), the &quot;haringhaven&quot;, the &quot;IJmondhaven&quot; and the Seaport Marina IJmuiden, a harbour for pleasure craft. IJmuiden became the largest fishing port of the Netherlands after the island of Urk became closed in by the Afsluitdijk. The town suffered heavy damage and demolition during World War II, because of its maritime importance.

===IJ-mouth===
Before IJmuiden was built, the area was known as &quot;Breesaap&quot;, a desolate plain where a handful of farming families strove to make a living.

Plans to connect Amsterdam with a canal to the North Sea, with its mouth in this area, had been drawn up already since 1626, but were only set into motion in the 19th century, when in 1851 the whole area was sold to the entrepreneurs Bik and Arnold. Ground was broken on 8 April 1865.

IJmuiden is the newest city in North Holland. It was founded on 1 November 1876, when the North Sea Canal was officially opened by William III of the Netherlands, shortcutting Amsterdam&#x27;s harbours&#x27; passage to the sea. He dubbed the town IJmuiden after passing the locks from the North Sea into the canal. After his ship, the paddle steamer &quot;Stad Breda&quot; built by the Stoomvaart Maatschappij Zeeland, passed, the first ship from Amsterdam, the &quot;SS Rembrandt&quot; built by the Royal Netherlands Steamship Company (KNSM), passed the other way. The workers who dug the canal later settled there; they found work after the canal was finished in the fishing industry, but many also suffered extreme poverty. 

The IJmuiden name literally means &quot;mouth of the IJ&quot;, which is a hint to the importance the town has for the Amsterdam harbour. The name first appeared, as &quot;IJ-muiden&quot;, in lines written in 1848 by the professor and journalist (and, later, a liberal finance minister in the Van Lynden van Sandenburg Cabinet) Simon Vissering. The present &quot;IJmuiden&quot; form was eventually adopted in 1876, as the North Sea Canal was being completed in this section.

In 1890 it had about 1,500 inhabitants, but boomed when the Koninklijke Nederlandse Hoogovens steelworks settled in IJmuiden in 1918. At that time shipping was at a low, because during World War I minesweepers laid mines nearby. The entry to the canal needed constant dredging due to the littoral drift in both directions on an open, sandy coast: due to winds blowing alternately from opposite quarters, sand accumulates in the sheltered angles outside the harbour between each converging breakwater and the shore.

===Second World War===

After the German invasion of the Netherlands on 10 May 1940, the Dutch Royal family left the country from IJmuiden in the late evening of 12 May. Some were on board the British destroyer , while Queen Wilhelmina left on board . The quays at IJmuiden were crowded at that time with people desperate to be transported across the channel, sometimes at great expense. During the Nazi German occupation, the canal was out of operation and the Germans destroyed most of IJmuiden to create what they called &quot;Festung IJmuiden&quot; (literally &quot;fortress&quot;, a heavily defended zone, from which the civilian population had been removed.

IJmuiden became the site of two separate fortified pens constructed by the German navy (&quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;) to house their &quot;schnellboote&quot; (fast torpedo boats, known to the Allies as E-boats) and &quot;Biber&quot; midget submarines. The older structure, codename &quot;Schnellbootbunker AY (SBB1)&quot;, was protected by a thick concrete roof. The newer one, codename &quot;Schnellbootbunker BY (SBB2)&quot;, had of concrete, with a further layer separated by an air–gap.

The E-boats laid up in the shelters during the day, safe from air attack, and put to sea under cover of night to attack Allied shipping. The pens were priority targets after D-day as the torpedo boats they protected were a great threat to the supply lines serving Allied forces. They were subjected to repeated air attack. This included four attacks by No. 9 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron of the Royal Air Force. These saw 53 five-ton, Tallboy earthquake bombs dropped. There were also two attacks in 1945 by the American air force with rocket-powered Disney bombs, specialist weapons designed to penetrate fortified, concrete bunkers that could resist conventional bombs. IJmuiden was liberated by the Allies on 4 May 1945.

The story of IJmuiden during the war is told in the Bunker Museum IJmuiden . The city is also mentioned in &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;.

== North Holland&#x27;s gate to the North Sea ==

After the war, the town was rebuilt according to a plan by the architect Willem Marinus Dudok. The statistical area IJmuiden, which includes the surrounding countryside, has a population of 30,466. The headquarters of the KNRM, Royal Netherlands Sea Rescue Institution is against the canal. The harbour coastline remains a measuring point for the northern extremes of the equidistantly set UK-Netherlands sea boundary. The law discounts the projection of Europoort, the natural end of which, Hook of Holland (&quot;Hoek van Holland&quot;), forms a southern measurement point.

The North Sea Canal connects the North Sea with the IJ Bay in Amsterdam, and the importance of this ship canal has been recognized with the introduction of the &quot;Holland Route&quot; along the canal by the European Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH). The places to see on this route are the Hoogovensmuseum, the system of sluice gates at the mouth of the canal, and the Zee- en Havenmuseum in IJmuiden. IJmuiden is home to two of the world&#x27;s most powerful water pumps capable of pumping per second.

Besides the Velsen Municipality Hall &quot;(Raadhuis van de gemeente Velsen)&quot;, designed by the architect Willem Dudok as a centerpiece to his plan for a new IJmuiden, important sights in IJmuiden are the North Sea locks. The latter are among the largest in the world and one set is able to close off a shipping lane wide and deep. There are plans to enlarge or build a new set to facilitate passage for even larger vessels.

DFDS Seaways operate a route between Amsterdam and Newcastle (Port of Tyne) via IJmuiden. A new roll-on/roll-off ferry route between IJmuiden and Great Yarmouth in the United Kingdom was considered. Any plans in that direction appear to have been abandoned by the relevant authorities.

The North Sea Race is a yacht race which takes place annually. The event covers a distance of and starts in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, in England and finishes in IJmuiden.

<doc id="203460" wikidata="Q3276071" url="?curid=203460" title="Monarchy of Luxembourg">
<text>The Grand Duke of Luxembourg is the head of state of Luxembourg. Luxembourg has been a grand duchy since 15 March 1815, when it was created from territory of the former Duchy of Luxembourg. It was in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands until 1890 under the House of Orange-Nassau. Luxembourg is the world&#x27;s only sovereign Grand Duchy and since 1815, there have been nine monarchs, including the incumbent, Henri.

==Constitutional role==
The constitution of Luxembourg defines the grand duke&#x27;s position:
:The grand duke is the head of state, symbol of its unity, and guarantor of national independence. He exercises executive power in accordance with the constitution and the laws of the country.

After a constitutional change (to article 34) in December 2008 resulting from Henri&#x27;s refusal to assent to a law legalizing euthanasia, laws now no longer require the grand duke&#x27;s formal assent (implying &quot;approval&quot;) but his task of promulgating the law as chief executive remains.

==Compensation==
The grand duke does not receive a salary, but the grand ducal family receives annually 300,000 gold francs (€281,000) for grand ducal functions. In 2017, the Luxembourg budget included €10.1 million for the grand duke&#x27;s household costs.

==Succession==

Succession to the throne was governed by Salic law, as dictated by the Nassau Family Pact, first adopted on 30 June 1783. The right to reign over Luxembourg was until June 2011 passed by agnatic-cognatic primogeniture within the House of Nassau, as stipulated under the 1815 Final Act of the Congress of Vienna and as confirmed by the 1867 Treaty of London. The Nassau Family Pact itself can be amended by the usual legislative process, having been so on 10 July 1907 to exclude the Count of Merenberg branch of the House, which was descended from a morganatic marriage.

An heir apparent may be granted the style &#x27;hereditary grand duke&#x27;. The current heir apparent is Hereditary Grand Duke Guillaume. In June 2011, agnatic primogeniture was replaced with absolute primogeniture, allowing any legitimate female descendants within the House of Nassau to be included in the line of succession.

==Full titles==
The traditional titulatures of the Grand Duke are &quot;By the Grace of God, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, Duke of Nassau, Count Palatine of the Rhine, Count of Sayn, Königstein, Katzenelnbogen and Diez, Burgrave of Hammerstein, Lord of Mahlberg, Wiesbaden, Idstein, Merenberg, Limburg and Eppstein&quot;. 

It should, however, be noted that many of the titles are held without regard to the strict rules of Salic inheritance and that most, save for Grand Duke of Luxembourg and Duke of Nassau, are simply not used.

==List of Grand Dukes==
===House of Orange-Nassau===

===House of Nassau-Weilburg===
Under the 1783 Nassau Family Pact, those territories of the Nassau family in the Holy Roman Empire at the time of the pact (Luxembourg and Nassau) were bound by semi-Salic law, which allowed inheritance by females or through the female line only upon extinction of male members of the dynasty. When William III died leaving only his daughter Wilhelmina as an heir, the crown of the Netherlands, not being bound by the family pact, passed to Wilhelmina. However, the crown of Luxembourg passed to a male of another branch of the House of Nassau: Adolphe, the dispossessed Duke of Nassau and head of the branch of Nassau-Weilburg.

In 1905, Grand Duke Adolphe&#x27;s younger half-brother, Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau, died, having left a son Georg Nikolaus, Count von Merenberg who was, however, the product of a morganatic marriage, and therefore not legally a member of the House of Nassau. In 1907, Adolphe&#x27;s only son, William IV, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, obtained passage of a law confirming the right of his eldest daughter, Marie-Adélaïde, to succeed to the throne in virtue of the absence of any remaining dynastic males of the House of Nassau, as originally stipulated in the Nassau Family Pact. She became the grand duchy&#x27;s first reigning female monarch upon her father&#x27;s death in 1912, and upon her own abdication in 1919, was succeeded by her younger sister Charlotte, who married Felix of Bourbon-Parma, a prince of the former Duchy of Parma. Charlotte&#x27;s descendants have since reigned as the continued dynasty of &quot;Nassau&quot;, and also constitute a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon-Parma.

==Grand ducal consorts==

* Princess Wilhelmine of Prussia (first wife of Grand Duke William I)
* Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna of Russia (wife of Grand Duke William II)
* Princess Sophie of Württemberg (first wife of Grand Duke William III)
* Princess Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont (second wife of Grand Duke William III)

<text>Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB; , &quot;Oikonomiko Panepistimio Athinon&quot;, abbrev. ΟΠΑ, OPA) is a public university based in Athens, Greece, specializing in the fields of Economics, Business Administration, and Information Technology. It encompasses a broad range of academic disciplines, including Statistics, Accounting and Finance, Computer Science, and European Studies. The university offers education at the undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral levels while also promoting research. AUEB is recognized as the leading institution for economic and business studies in Greece.

== History ==

The Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB) was founded in 1920 under the name of Athens School of Commercial Studies. It was renamed in 1926 as the Supreme School of Economics and Business (, &quot;Anotati Scholi Oikonomikon kai Emborikon Epistimon&quot;, abbrev. ΑΣΟΕΕ, ASOEE), a name that was retained until 1989 when it assumed its present name, the Athens University of Economics and Business. Though the university of business&#x27;s official name has changed, it is still known popularly in Greek by this former acronym.

It is the oldest university in Greece in the fields of Economics and Business, its roots tracing to the establishment of a Merchant Academy in Athens. Up to 1955 the school offered only one degree in the general area of economics and commerce. In 1955 the duration of study at the School is increased from three to four years and two cycles of study leading to two separate degrees: one in economics and the other in business administration. In 1984 the school was divided into three departments, namely the Department of Economics, the Department of Business Administration and the Department of Statistics and Business Informatics, the latter renamed to the Informatics Department in 1995.

In 1989, the university expanded to six departments. From 1999 onwards, the university developed even further and nowadays it includes eight academic departments, offering eight undergraduate degrees, 28 master&#x27;s degrees and an equivalent number of doctoral programs.

In 2025, AUEB launched its inaugural English-taught undergraduate program, the &quot;Bachelor in International Business &amp; Technology,&quot; exclusively designed for international students. The four-year program offers a comprehensive curriculum that integrates business fundamentals, such as strategy, innovation, and entrepreneurship, with cutting-edge technological studies, including business intelligence, digital marketing, and artificial intelligence. 

Its main building is housed on Patision Street 76, while other buildings of the university are located in the nearby area.

== Academic departments ==
The Athens University of Economics and Business today comprises three Schools and 8 academic Departments.

Each Department accepts students at the undergraduate level, after successfully passing the pan-Hellenic exams, and offers a 4-year undergraduate program of studies. Each academic department also offers one or more graduate programs of studies, leading to a master&#x27;s degree, as well as a Doctoral Program, leading to a PhD Degree.

== Undergraduate studies ==
Each department of the Athens University of Economics and Business awards an undergraduate degree (Ptychion) equivalent to a four-year B.A. or B.Sc. in their respective fields. To be able to graduate and get their degree, a student has to attend and successfully complete 8 semesters of study (four years), corresponding to a total of approximately 240 ECTS credit hours. Foreign language courses in English, French, or German are offered in all semesters and count towards degree requirements. Depending on their choice of electives, students acquire a major concentration on particular subjects.

=== Undergraduate courses in English ===
In addition to the above, there are many courses offered in English, mainly (but not only) for international students who come to AUEB under the Erasmus program. A total of approximately 60 courses are offered in English, each one counting towards 6 ECTS credits.

== Postgraduate studies ==
Doctorates are awarded by each Department upon the completion of courses, a successful qualifying exam, a dissertation and its successful defence in public. Holding a master&#x27;s degree is a necessary requirement in order to be accepted to the Ph.D. program.

=== Masters programmes ===
There are 29 different Masters Programmes that are currently offered at AUEB. They include full-time programmes, part-time programmes, and joint programmes.

The duration of graduate studies at the Master&#x27;s level is between 15–27 months. Students are admitted to these programs after satisfying certain admission criteria such as results at the GMAT or GRE tests, proficiency of English, academic performance at the undergraduate level, work experience (mainly for the MBA as well as the part-time programs). Graduate students may receive scholarships or assistantships.

<doc id="203464" wikidata="Q219217" url="?curid=203464" title="Tulip mania">
<text>Tulip mania () was a period during the Dutch Golden Age when contract prices for some bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels. The major acceleration started in 1634 and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637. It is generally considered to have been the first recorded speculative bubble or asset bubble in history. In many ways, the tulip mania was more of a then-unknown socio-economic phenomenon than a significant economic crisis. It had no critical influence on the prosperity of the Dutch Republic, which was one of the world&#x27;s leading economic and financial powers in the 17th century, with the highest per capita income in the world from about 1600 to about 1720. The term &quot;tulip mania&quot; is now often used metaphorically to refer to any large economic bubble when asset prices deviate from intrinsic values.

Forward markets appeared in the Dutch Republic during the 17th century. Among the most notable was one centred on the tulip market. At the peak of tulip mania, in February 1637, some single tulip bulbs sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled artisan. Research is difficult because of the limited economic data from the 1630s, much of which come from biased and speculative sources. Some modern economists have proposed rational explanations, rather than a speculative mania, for the rise and fall in prices. For example, other flowers, such as the hyacinth, also had high initial prices at the time of their introduction, which then fell as the plants were propagated. The high prices may also have been driven by expectations of a parliamentary decree that contracts could be voided for a small cost, thus lowering the risk to buyers.

The 1637 event gained popular attention in 1841 with the publication of the book &quot;Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds&quot;, written by Scottish journalist Charles Mackay, who wrote that at one point of land were offered for a &quot;Semper Augustus&quot; bulb. Mackay claimed that many investors were ruined by the fall in prices, and Dutch commerce suffered a severe shock. Although Mackay&#x27;s book is a classic, his account is contested. Many modern scholars believe that the mania was not as destructive as he described.

== Background and history ==
===The Dutch tulip business===
The introduction of the tulip to Europe is often questionably attributed to Ogier de Busbecq, the ambassador of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, to Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, who sent the first tulip bulbs and seeds to Vienna in 1554 from the Ottoman Empire. Tulip bulbs, along with other new plant life like potatoes, peppers, tomatoes, and other vegetables, came to Europe in the 16th century. These bulbs were soon distributed from Vienna to Augsburg, Antwerp, and Amsterdam.

Their popularity and cultivation in the United Provinces (now the Netherlands) started in earnest around 1593 after the Southern Netherlandish botanist Carolus Clusius had taken up a post at the University of Leiden and established the &quot;hortus academicus&quot;. He planted his collection of tulip bulbs and found that they were able to tolerate the harsher conditions of the Low Countries. Shortly thereafter, the tulip grew in popularity.

The tulip was different from other flowers known to Europe at that time, because of its intense saturated petal colour. The appearance of the nonpareil tulip as a status symbol coincides with the rise of newly independent Holland&#x27;s trade fortunes. No longer the Spanish Netherlands, its economic resources could now be channelled into commerce and Holland embarked on its Golden Age. Amsterdam merchants were at the centre of the lucrative East Indies trade, where one voyage could yield profits of 400%.
As a result, tulips rapidly became a coveted luxury item, and a profusion of varieties followed. They were classified in groups: the single-hued tulips of red, yellow, or white were known as ; the multicolored (white streaks on a red or pink background); (white streaks on a purple or lilac background); and the rarest of all, the (&#x27;Bizarres&#x27;), (yellow or white streaks on a red, brown, or purple background). The multicolour effects of intricate lines and flame-like streaks on the petals were vivid and spectacular, making the bulbs that produced these even more exotic-looking plants highly sought-after. It is now known that this effect is due to the bulbs being infected with a type of tulip-specific mosaic virus, known as the &quot;tulip breaking virus&quot;, so called because it &quot;breaks&quot; the one petal colour into two or more. Less conspicuously, the virus also progressively impairs the tulip&#x27;s production of daughter bulbs.

Growers named their new varieties with exalted titles. Many early forms were prefixed (&#x27;admiral&#x27;), often combined with the growers&#x27; names: was perhaps the most highly regarded of about fifty so named. (&#x27;general&#x27;) was another prefix used for around thirty varieties. Later varieties were given even more extravagant names, derived from Alexander the Great or Scipio, or even &quot;Admiral of Admirals&quot; and &quot;General of Generals&quot;. Naming could be haphazard and varieties highly variable in quality. Most of these varieties have now died out.

The tulips bloomed in April and May for about one week. During the plant&#x27;s dormant phase from June to September, bulbs can be uprooted and moved about, so actual purchases (in the spot market) occurred during these months. During the rest of the year, &quot;florists&quot;, or tulip traders, signed forward contracts before a notary to buy tulips at the end of the season. Thus the Dutch, who developed many of the techniques of modern finance, created a market for tulip bulbs, which were durable goods. Short selling was banned by an edict of 1610, which was reiterated or strengthened in 1621 and 1630, and again in 1636. Short sellers were not prosecuted under these edicts, but forward contracts were deemed unenforceable, so traders could repudiate deals if faced with a loss.

===Speculative period===

As the flowers grew in popularity, professional growers paid higher and higher prices for bulbs with the virus, and prices rose steadily. By 1634, in part as a result of demand from the French, speculators began to enter the market. The contract price of rare bulbs continued to rise throughout 1636. By November, the price of common, &quot;unbroken&quot; bulbs also began to increase, so that soon any tulip bulb could fetch hundreds of guilders. Forward contracts were used to buy bulbs at the end of the season.

Traders met in &quot;college&quot; at taverns and buyers were required to pay a 2.5% &quot;wine money&quot; fee, up to a maximum of three guilders per trade. Neither party paid an initial margin, nor a mark-to-market margin, and all contracts were with the individual counter-parties rather than with the Exchange. The Dutch described tulip contract trading as (literally &#x27;wind trade&#x27;), because no bulbs were actually changing hands. The entire business was accomplished on the margins of Dutch economic life, not in the Exchange itself.
Tulip mania reached its peak during the winter of 1636–37, when some contracts were changing hands five times. No deliveries were ever made to fulfill these contracts, because in February 1637, tulip bulb contract prices collapsed abruptly and the trade of tulips ground to a halt. A contemporary satire suggests that the crisis started to unravel at 3 February in Haarlem, where an auctioneer failed to find willing buyers, despite lowering the asking price several times. The actual circumstances of the crash are unknown. The collapse seems to have occurred by the end of the first week of February 1637, which caused a number of disputes over the extant contracts. On February 7th, tulip growers scrambled in Utrecht to elect representatives for a national assembly in Amsterdam. Their situation had become uncertain as the buyers no longer had any interest in honoring the contracts, and there was no legal basis for enforcing them.

By the end of February, the representatives gathered in Amsterdam for deliberations. They decided on a compromise where all contracts entered before December 1636 would be binding, but later contracts could be cancelled by paying a fee amounting to 10% of the price. The matter was brought before the Court of Holland, which declined to rule one way or the other and referred the question back to the city councils. The legislature of Holland decided to cancel all contracts to allow fresh deals to be struck during the summer. In Haarlem the issue dragged on, since the government left it to the parties to solve their issues by arbitration or other means. In Maym the city ruled that buyers could cancel any extant contracts at a fee of 3.5% of the price. The Dutch court system remained busy with a number of tulip disputes throughout 1639. In the end, most contracts were simply never honored.

== Available price data ==
The lack of consistently recorded price data from the 1630s makes the extent of the tulip mania difficult to discern. The bulk of available data comes from an anonymous satire, &quot;Dialogues between Waermondt and Gaergoedt&quot;, written just after the bubble. Economist collected data on the sales of 161 bulbs of 39 varieties between 1633 and 1637, with 53 being recorded in the &quot;Dialogues&quot;.

Ninety eight sales were recorded for the last date of the bubble, February 5, 1637, at wildly varying prices. The sales were made using several market mechanisms: forward trading at the colleges, spot sales by growers, notarized forward sales by growers, and estate sales. &quot;To a great extent, the available price data are a blend of apples and oranges&quot;, according to Garber.

== Mackay&#x27;s &quot;Madness of Crowds&quot; ==

The modern discussion of tulip mania began with the book &quot;Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds&quot;, published in 1841 by the Scottish journalist Charles Mackay. He proposed that crowds of people often behave irrationally, and tulip mania was, along with the South Sea Bubble and the Mississippi Company scheme, one of his primary examples. His account was largely sourced from a 1797 work by Johann Beckmann titled &quot;A History of Inventions, Discoveries, and Origins&quot;. Beckmann in turn used several available sources, but all of them drew heavily from the satirical &quot;Dialogues&quot; that were written to mock the speculators. Mackay&#x27;s vivid book was popular among generations of economists and stock market participants. His popular but flawed description of tulip mania as a speculative bubble remains prominent, even though since the 1980s economists have debunked many aspects of his account.

According to Mackay, the growing popularity of tulips in the early 17th century caught the attention of the entire nation; &quot;the population, even to its lowest dregs, embarked in the tulip trade&quot;. By 1635, a sale of 40 bulbs for 100,000 florins (also known as Dutch guilders) was recorded. By way of comparison, a &quot;tun&quot; () of butter cost around 100 florins, a skilled laborer might earn 150–350 florins a year, and &quot;eight fat swine&quot; cost 240 florins.

By 1636, tulips were traded on the exchanges of numerous Dutch towns and cities. This encouraged trade by all members of society. Mackay recounted people selling possessions in order to speculate on the tulip market, such as an offer of of land for one of two existing &quot;Semper Augustus&quot; bulbs, or a single bulb of the &quot;Viceroy&quot; that, he said, was purchased in exchange for a basket of goods (shown in table) worth 2,500 florins.


The increasing mania generated several amusing, if unlikely, anecdotes that Mackay recounted, such as a sailor who mistook the valuable tulip bulb of a merchant for an onion and grabbed it to eat. According to Mackay, the merchant and his family hunted down the sailor to find him &quot;eating a breakfast whose cost might have regaled a whole ship&#x27;s crew for a twelvemonth&quot;; the sailor was supposedly jailed for eating the bulb. However, tulips are poisonous if prepared incorrectly, taste bad, and are considered to be only marginally edible even during famines. This directly contradicts Mackay&#x27;s claim that the tulip bulb had been &quot;quite delicious&quot;.

People were purchasing bulbs at higher and higher prices, intending to re-sell them for a profit. Such a scheme could not last unless someone was ultimately willing to pay such high prices and take possession of the bulbs. In February 1637, tulip traders could no longer find new buyers willing to pay increasingly inflated prices for their bulbs. As this realization set in, the demand for tulips collapsed, and prices plummeted—the speculative bubble burst. Some were left holding contracts to purchase tulips at prices now ten times greater than those on the open market, while others found themselves in possession of bulbs now worth a fraction of the price they had paid. Mackay says the Dutch devolved into distressed accusations and recriminations against others in the trade.

In Mackay&#x27;s account, the panicked tulip speculators sought help from the government of the Netherlands, which responded by declaring that anyone who had bought contracts to purchase bulbs in the future could void their contract by payment of a 10 percent fee. Attempts were made to resolve the situation to the satisfaction of all parties, but these were unsuccessful. The mania finally ended, Mackay says, with individuals stuck with the bulbs they held at the end of the crash—no court would enforce payment of a contract, since judges regarded the debts as contracted through gambling, and thus not enforceable by law.

According to Mackay, lesser tulip manias also occurred in other parts of Europe, although matters never reached the state they had in the Netherlands. He also thought that the aftermath of the tulip price deflation led to a widespread economic chill throughout the Netherlands for many years afterwards.

== Modern views ==
Mackay&#x27;s account of inexplicable mania was unchallenged, and mostly unexamined, until the 1980s. Research into tulip mania since then, especially by proponents of the efficient-market hypothesis, suggests that his story was incomplete and inaccurate. In her 2007 scholarly analysis &quot;Tulipmania&quot;, Anne Goldgar states that the phenomenon was limited to &quot;a fairly small group&quot;, and that most accounts from the period &quot;are based on one or two contemporary pieces of propaganda and a prodigious amount of plagiarism&quot;. Peter Garber argues that the trade in common bulbs &quot;was no more than a meaningless winter drinking game, played by a plague-ridden population that made use of the vibrant tulip market.&quot;

While Mackay&#x27;s account held that a wide array of society was involved in the tulip trade, Goldgar&#x27;s study of archived contracts found that even at its peak the trade in tulips was conducted almost exclusively by merchants and skilled craftsmen who were wealthy, but not members of the nobility. Any economic fallout from the bubble was very limited. Goldgar, who identified many prominent buyers and sellers in the market, found fewer than half a dozen who experienced financial troubles in the time period, and even of these cases it is not clear that tulips were to blame. This is not altogether surprising. Although prices had risen, money had not changed hands between buyers and sellers. Thus profits were never realised for sellers; unless sellers had made other purchases on credit in expectation of the profits, the collapse in prices did not cause anyone to lose money.

=== Rational explanations ===
It is well established that prices for tulip bulb contracts rose and then fell between 1636 and 1637; however, such dramatic curves do not necessarily imply that an economic or speculative bubble developed and then burst. For the then tulip market to qualify as an economic bubble, the price of bulbs would need to have been mutually agreed and surpassed the intrinsic value of the bulbs. Modern economists have advanced several possible reasons for why the rise and fall in prices may not have constituted a bubble, even though a Viceroy Tulip was worth upwards of five times the cost of an average house at the time.

The increases of the 1630s corresponded with a lull in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In 1634–1635 the German and Swedish armies lost ground in the South of Germany; then Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria moved north. After the Peace of Prague the French and the Dutch decided to support the Swedish and German Protestants with money and arms against the Habsburg empire, and to occupy the Spanish Netherlands in 1636. Hence market prices, at least initially, were responding rationally to a rise in demand. The fall in prices was faster and more dramatic than the rise. Data on sales largely disappeared after the February 1637 collapse in prices, but a few other data points on bulb prices after tulip mania show that bulbs continued to lose value for decades thereafter.

=== Natural volatility in flower prices ===
Garber compared the available price data on tulips to hyacinth prices at the beginning of the 19th century when the hyacinth replaced the tulip as the fashionable flower and found a similar pattern. When hyacinths were introduced florists strove with one another to grow beautiful hyacinth flowers, as demand was strong. As people became more accustomed to hyacinths the prices began to fall. The most expensive bulbs fell to 1 to 2 percent of their peak value within 30 years.

Garber notes that, &quot;a small quantity of prototype lily bulbs recently was sold for 1 million guilders ($US480,000 at 1987 exchange rates)&quot;, demonstrating that even in the modern world, flowers can command extremely high prices. Because the rise in prices occurred after bulbs were planted for the year, growers would not have had an opportunity to increase production in response to price.

==== Critiques ====
Other economists believe that these elements cannot completely explain the dramatic rise and fall in tulip prices. Garber&#x27;s theory has also been challenged for failing to explain a similar dramatic rise and fall in prices for regular tulip bulb contracts. Some economists also point to other factors associated with speculative bubbles, such as a growth in the supply of money, demonstrated by an increase in deposits at the Bank of Amsterdam during that period.

=== Legal changes ===
Earl Thompson argued in a 2007 paper that Garber&#x27;s explanation cannot account for the extremely swift drop in tulip bulb contract prices. The annualised rate of price decline was 99.999%, instead of the average 40% for other flowers. He provided another explanation for Dutch tulip mania. Since late 1636, the Dutch parliament had been considering a decree (originally sponsored by Dutch tulip investors who had lost money because of a German setback in the Thirty Years&#x27; War) that changed the way tulip contracts functioned:

Before this parliamentary decree, the purchaser of a tulip contract—known in modern finance as a forward contract—was legally to buy the bulbs. The decree changed the nature of these contracts, so that if the current market price fell, the purchaser could opt to pay a penalty and forgo receipt of the bulb, rather than pay the full contracted price. This change in law meant that, in modern terminology, the forward contracts had been transformed into options contracts—contracts which were extremely favourable to the buyers.

Thompson argues that the &quot;bubble&quot; in the price of tulip bulb forward prior to the February 1637 decree was due primarily to buyers&#x27; awareness of what was coming. Although the final 3.5% strike price was not actually settled until February 24, Thompson writes, &quot;as information[...] entered the market in late November, contract prices soared to reflect the expectation that the contract price was now a call-option exercise, or strike, price rather than a price committed to be paid.&quot;

Thompson concludes that &quot;the real victims of the contractual conversion&quot; were the investors who had bought forward contracts to November 30, 1636, on the incorrect assumption that their contracts would benefit from the February 1637 decree. In other words, many investors were making an &quot;additional gamble with respect to the prices the buyers would eventually have to pay for their options&quot;—a factor unrelated to the intrinsic value of the tulip bulbs themselves.

Using data about the specific payoffs present in the forward and options contracts, Thompson argued that tulip bulb contract prices hewed closely to what a rational economic model would dictate: &quot;Tulip contract prices before, during, and after the &#x27;tulipmania&#x27; appear to provide a remarkable illustration of efficient market prices.&quot;

== Social mania and legacy ==

The popularity of Mackay&#x27;s tale has continued to this day, with new editions of &quot;Extraordinary Popular Delusions&quot; appearing regularly, with introductions by writers such as financier Bernard Baruch (1932), financial writer Andrew Tobias (1980), psychologist David J. Schneider (1993), and journalist Michael Lewis (2008).

Goldgar argues that although tulip mania may not have constituted an economic or speculative bubble, it was nonetheless traumatic to the Dutch for other reasons: &quot;Even though the financial crisis affected very few, the shock of tulipmania was considerable. A whole network of values was thrown into doubt.&quot; The bubble in 1634 shows how people can get caught up in a financial craze even when something doesn&#x27;t have real value. This is an example of the phenomenon called collective illusions. Here, the Dutch elite thought that having their own special tulip bulbs was a must, and this made the prices go up, even though tulips themselves weren&#x27;t worth much. In the 17th century, it was unimaginable to most people that something as common as a flower could be worth so much more money than most people earned in a year. The idea that the prices of flowers that grow only in the summer could fluctuate so wildly in the winter, threw into chaos the very understanding of &quot;value&quot;.

Many of the sources telling of the woes of tulip mania, such as the anti-speculative pamphlets that were later reported by Beckmann and Mackay, have been cited as evidence of the extent of the economic damage. These pamphlets were not written by victims of a bubble, but were primarily religiously motivated. The upheaval was viewed as a perversion of the moral order—proof that &quot;concentration on the earthly, rather than the heavenly flower could have dire consequences&quot;.

Nearly a century later, during the crash of the Mississippi Company and the South Sea Company in about 1720, tulip mania appeared in satires of these manias. When Beckmann first described tulip mania in the 1780s, he compared it to the failing lotteries of the time. In Goldgar&#x27;s view, even many modern popular works about financial markets, such as Burton Malkiel&#x27;s &quot;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&quot; (1973) and John Kenneth Galbraith&#x27;s &quot;A Short History of Financial Euphoria&quot; (1990; written soon after the crash of 1987), used the tulip mania as a lesson in morality.

Tulip mania became a popular reference during the dot-com bubble of 1995–2001, and the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007–2010. In 2013, Nout Wellink, former president of the Dutch Central Bank, described Bitcoin as &quot;worse than the tulip mania&quot;, adding, &quot;At least then you got a tulip, now you get nothing.&quot; Despite the mania&#x27;s enduring popularity, Daniel Gross has said of economists offering efficient-market explanations for the mania, &quot;If they&#x27;re correct[...] then business writers will have to delete Tulipmania from their handy-pack of bubble analogies.&quot;

<text>The Internet Society (ISOC) is an American nonprofit advocacy organization founded in 1992 with local chapters around the world. Its mission is &quot;to promote the open development, evolution, and use of the Internet for the benefit of all people throughout the world&quot;. It has offices in Reston, Virginia, U.S., and Geneva, Switzerland.

== Organization ==
The Internet Society has regional bureaus worldwide, composed of chapters, organizational members, and, as of July 2020, more than 70,000 individual members. The Internet Society has a staff of more than 100 and was governed by a board of trustees, whose members are appointed or elected by the society&#x27;s chapters, organization members, and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The IETF comprised the Internet Society&#x27;s volunteer base. Its leadership includes Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Ted Hardie; and President and CEO, Sally Wentworth.

The Internet Society created the Public Interest Registry (PIR), launched the Internet Hall of Fame, and served as the organizational home of the IETF. The Internet Society Foundation was created in 2017 as its independent philanthropic arm, which awarded grants to organizations.

== History ==
In 1991, the National Science Foundation (NSF) contract with the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) to operate the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) expired. The then Internet Activities Board (IAB) sought to create a non-profit institution that could take over the role. In 1992 Vint Cerf, Bob Kahn and Lyman Chapin announced the formation of the Internet Society as &quot;a professional society to facilitate, support, and promote the evolution and growth of the Internet as a global research communications infrastructure&quot;, which would incorporate the IAB, the IETF, and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), plus the organization of the annual INET meetings. This arrangement was formalized in RFC1602 in 1993.

In 1999, after Jon Postel&#x27;s death, ISOC established the Jonathan B. Postel Service Award. The award has been presented every year since 1999 by the Internet Society to &quot;honor a person who has made outstanding contributions in service to the data communications community&quot;.

By mid-2000, the Internet Society&#x27;s finances became precarious, and several individuals and organizations stepped forward to fill the gap. Until 2001, there were also trustees elected by individual members of the Internet Society. Those elections were &quot;suspended&quot; in 2001. This was ostensibly done as a fiscal measure due to the perception that the elections were too expensive for the precarious financial state of the organization. In later Bylaw revisions, the concept of individual member-selected trustees went from &quot;suspended&quot; to being deleted altogether.

In late 2001, leaders from Afilias (a domain name registry) approached the Internet Society CEO Lynn St.Amour, to propose a novel partnership to jointly bid for the .org registry. In this model, the Internet Society would become the new home of .org, and all technical and service functions would be managed by Afilias. Afilias would pay for all bid expenses and would contribute towards the Internet Society payroll while the bid was under consideration by ICANN. The Internet Society Board approved this proposal at their Board meeting in 2001.

In 2002 ISOC successfully bid for the .org registry and formed the Public Interest Registry (PIR), to manage and operate it.

In 2010, ISOC launched its first community network initiative to deploy five wireless mesh-based networks in rural locations across India.

In 2012, on ISOC&#x27;s 20th anniversary, it established the Internet Hall of Fame, an award to &quot;publicly recognize a distinguished and select group of visionaries, leaders, and luminaries who have made significant contributions to the development and advancement of the global Internet&quot;.

On June 8, 2011, ISOC mounted World IPv6 Day to test IPv6 deployment.

In 2012 ISOC launched Deploy360, a portal and training program to promote IPv6 and DNSSEC.

On June 6, 2012, ISOC organized the World IPv6 Launch, this time with the intention of leaving IPv6 permanently enabled on all participating sites.

In 2016 Deploy 360 extended its campaigns to include Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS) and DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE).

In 2017 ISOC&#x27;s North America Region launched an annual Indigenous Connectivity Summit with an event in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In subsequent years the event has been held in Inuvik, NWT, and Hilo, Hawaii.

In December 2017 ISOC absorbed the standards body Online Trust Alliance (OTA) which produces an annual Online Trust Audit, a Cyber Incident Response Guide, and an Internet of Things (IoT) Trust Framework.

In August 2018 the Internet Society organized the IETF more formally as the IETF Administration LLC (IETF LLC) underneath ISOC. The IETF LLC continues to be closely associated with ISOC and is significantly funded by ISOC.

== Support of United Nations Internet Governance Initiative ==
The ubiquity of the Internet in modern-day society has prompted António Guterres, the United Nations Secretary-General to convene a panel of professional experts to discuss the future of the Internet and the role of the Internet in globalized digital cooperation. Three models were proposed after several rounds of discussion, i.e. a Digital Commons Architecture (DCA), a Distributed Co-Governance Architecture (CoGov), and a reformed Internet Governance Forum (IGF+). As of October 2020, the ISOC is leading and facilitating multi-round meetings for Stakeholders&#x27; Dialogue to collect, compile, and submit the inputs of worldwide professionals and experts for future governance of the Internet.

== Activities ==
In the late 1990s, the Internet Society established the Jonathan B. Postel Service Award. It was presented every year to honor a person who has made outstanding contributions in service to the data communications community.

The Internet Society&#x27;s activities included MANRS (Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security) – which was launched in 2014 to provide crucial fixes to reduce the most common threats to the Internet&#x27;s routing infrastructure.

The society organized the Africa Peering and Interconnection Forum (AfPIF) to help grow the Internet infrastructure in Africa and hosts Internet development conferences in developing markets.

The society offered Deploy360, an information hub, portal and training program to promote IPv6 and DNSSEC.

In 2017 it launched an annual Indigenous Connectivity Summit to connect tribal communities, starting with an event in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In subsequent years the event was held in Inuvik, NWT, and Hilo, Hawaii.

The society also publishes reports on global Internet issues, and created tools, surveys, codes, and policy recommendations to improve Internet use. The society supports projects to build community networks and infrastructure, secure routing protocols, and advocate for end-to-end encryption.

== Controversies ==

=== Sale of the Public Interest Registry ===
In 2019 the Internet Society agreed to the sale of the Public Interest Registry (PIR) to Ethos Capital for $1.135 billion, a transaction initially expected to be completed in early 2020. The Internet Society said it planned to use the proceeds to fund an endowment. The Public Interest Registry is a non-profit subsidiary of the Internet Society which operates three top-level domain names (.ORG, .NGO, and .ONG), all of which have traditionally focused on serving the non-profit and non-governmental organization communities.

The sale was met with significant opposition due to involving the transfer of what is viewed as a public asset to a private equity investment firm. In late January 2020, the ICANN halted its final approval of the sale after the Attorney General of California requested detailed documentation from all parties, citing concerns that both ICANN and the Internet Society had potentially violated their public interest missions as registered charities subject to the laws of California. In February, the Internet Society&#x27;s &quot;Chapter Advisory Council&quot; (which represents its membership) began the process to adopt a motion rejecting the sale if certain conditions were not complied with. On April 30, 2020, ICANN rejected the proposal to sell the PIR to Ethos Capital.

=== Denial of participation of Iranians in activities ===
In September 2016, the Internet Society indicated that it would not seek to obtain a license from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury that would allow it to fund the activities of Iranian nationals. This caused considerable distress to ISOC members in Iran, who were thus unable to launch an Internet Society chapter in Iran, and saw a fellowship revoked that the Internet Society had awarded to fund the travel of Iranian student to visit the Internet Governance Forum in Mexico.

<text>A flooding algorithm is an algorithm for distributing material to every part of a graph. The name derives from the concept of inundation by a flood. Flooding algorithms are used in computer networking and graphics. Flooding algorithms are also useful for solving many mathematical problems, including maze problems and many problems in graph theory.

Different flooding algorithms can be applied for different problems, and run with different time complexities. For example, the flood fill algorithm is a simple but relatively robust algorithm that works for intricate geometries and can determine which part of the (target) area that is connected to a given (source) node in a multi-dimensional array, and is trivially generalized to arbitrary graph structures. If there instead are several source nodes, there are no obstructions in the geometry represented in the multi-dimensional array, and one wishes to segment the area based on which of the source nodes the target nodes are closest to, while the flood fill algorithm can still be used, the jump flooding algorithm is potentially much faster as it has a lower time complexity. Unlike the flood fill algorithm, however, the jump flooding algorithm cannot trivially be generalized to unstructured graphs.

<doc id="203472" wikidata="Q465744" url="?curid=203472" title="Affair of the Diamond Necklace">
<text>The Affair of the Diamond Necklace (, &quot;Affair of the Queen&#x27;s Necklace&quot;) was an incident from 1784 to 1785 at the court of King Louis XVI of France that involved his wife, Queen Marie Antoinette.

The queen&#x27;s reputation, already tarnished by gossip, was further sullied by the false accusation that she had participated in a crime to defraud the Crown&#x27;s jewellers in acquiring a very expensive diamond necklace she then refused to pay for. In reality, she had rejected the idea of buying it only to have her signature forged by Jeanne de Valois-Saint-Rémy. Although Valois-Saint-Rémy was later convicted, the event remains historically significant as one of many that led to the French disillusionment with the monarchy, in that it was one of the contemporary scandals that gave moral weight and popular support for the French Revolution.

==Background==
In 1772, Louis XV of France decided to make Madame du Barry, one of his mistresses, a special gift at the estimated cost of 2,000,000 livres (approximately US$17.5 million in 2024). He requested that Parisian jewelers Charles Auguste Boehmer and Paul Bassenge create a diamond necklace that would surpass all others in grandeur.

It took the jewellers several years and a great deal of money to gather an appropriate set of diamonds. In the meantime, Louis XV died of smallpox, and his grandson and successor banished Madame du Barry from the court.

It was, according to historian Thomas Carlyle, &quot;a row of seventeen glorious diamonds, as large almost as filberts... a three-wreathed festoon, and pendants enough (simple pear shaped, multiple star-shaped, or clustering amorphous) encircle it... around a very Queen of Diamonds&quot;. The jewellers hoped it would be a product that the new Queen of France, Marie Antoinette, would buy and indeed in 1778 King Louis XVI offered it to his wife as a present, but she refused. The queen initially turned it down stating (if Carlyle is to be believed) &quot;We have more need of seventy-fours [ships] than of necklaces.&quot; Some said that Marie Antoinette refused the necklace because it was created for du Barry, whom she strongly disliked. According to others, Louis XVI had changed his mind. After having vainly tried to place the necklace outside France, the jewellers again attempted to sell it to Marie Antoinette after the birth of Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France, in 1781. The queen again refused.

==Affair==
A confidence trickster who called herself Jeanne de Valois-Saint-Rémy, also known as Jeanne de la Motte, made a plan to use the necklace to gain wealth and possibly power and royal patronage. A descendant of an out-of-wedlock son of Henry II of France, Jeanne had married an officer of the gendarmes, Nicholas de la Motte, the self-proclaimed &quot;Comte de la Motte&quot;. She was living on a small pension that had been granted to her by the king.

In March 1785, Jeanne became the mistress of the Cardinal de Rohan, a former French ambassador to the court of Vienna. Rohan was regarded with displeasure by Marie Antoinette for having spread rumors about the queen&#x27;s behavior to her formidable mother, Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa. The queen had also learned of a letter in which Rohan wrote of Maria Theresa in a manner that the queen found offensive. Rohan was then trying to regain the queen&#x27;s favor to become one of the king&#x27;s ministers. Jeanne, having entered court utilizing a lover named Rétaux de Villette, persuaded Rohan that she had been received by the queen and enjoyed her favor. On hearing of that, Rohan resolved to use Jeanne to regain the queen&#x27;s good will. Jeanne assured Rohan that she was making efforts on his behalf.
Thus began an alleged correspondence between Rohan and the queen. Jeanne returned the replies to Rohan&#x27;s notes, which she affirmed came from the queen. As the tone of the letters became very warm, Rohan became convinced that Marie Antoinette was in love with him and became enamored of her. He begged Jeanne to arrange a secret night-time interview with the queen on his behalf; the supposed meeting took place in August 1784. In the gardens of the Palace of Versailles, Rohan met with a woman whom he believed to be Marie Antoinette. In fact, the woman was a prostitute, Nicole Le Guay d&#x27;Oliva, whom Jeanne had hired because of her resemblance to the queen. Rohan offered her a rose. In her role as the queen, she promised him that she would forget their past disagreements.

Jeanne took advantage of Rohan&#x27;s belief in her by borrowing large sums of money from him, telling him that they were for the queen&#x27;s charity work. With that money, Jeanne could make her way into respectable society. As she openly boasted about her mythical relationship with the queen, many assumed that the affair was genuine.
The jewelers Boehmer and Bassenge resolved to use Jeanne to sell their necklace. She at first refused a commission but then changed her mind and accepted it. According to Madame Campan, Jeanne, pretending to be the queen, sent several letters to the cardinal, including an order to buy the necklace. They were signed &quot;Marie Antoinette de France&quot;, but Rohan did not know or remember that French royals signed only with their given names.

On 21 January 1785, Jeanne told Rohan that Marie Antoinette wanted to buy the necklace but, not wishing to purchase such an expensive item publicly during a time of need, the queen wanted Rohan to act as a secret intermediary. A little while later, Rohan negotiated the purchase of the necklace for 2,000,000 livres, to be paid in installments. He claimed to have the queen&#x27;s authorization for the purchase and showed the jewelers the conditions of the bargain in the queen&#x27;s handwriting. Rohan took the necklace to Jeanne&#x27;s house, where a man, whom Rohan believed to be a valet of the queen, came to fetch it. The diamond necklace &quot;was promptly picked apart, and the gems sold on the black markets of Paris and London&quot; by Jeanne.

When the time came to pay, Jeanne presented Rohan&#x27;s notes, but they were insufficient. Boehmer complained to the queen, who told him that she had neither ordered nor received the necklace. She had the story of the negotiations repeated for her and by August began making arrests, following which the scandal broke loose.

== Scandal ==
The controversy of the event stems from the arrest of Rohan in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles and the trial that declared him innocent and Jeanne and her accomplices guilty. On 15 August 1785, the feast of the Assumption of Mary, while the court was awaiting the king and queen to go to the chapel, Rohan, who was to officiate, was taken before the king, the queen, the Minister of the Court Louis Auguste Le Tonnelier de Breteuil, and the Keeper of the Seals Armand Thomas Hue de Miromesnil to explain himself. Rohan produced a letter signed &quot;Marie Antoinette de France&quot;. Royalty signed with only the baptismal name, but that fact was missed by Rohan and brought up during his trial and &quot;prejudiced the king against Rohan&quot; as he &quot;breath[ed] royal etiquette since birth... and could not understand how a courtier, and above all a Rohan, a member of a family so keen on the details of status, could make such a mistake&quot;. Rohan was arrested and taken to the Bastille. On the way, he sent home a note ordering the destruction of his correspondence. Jeanne was not arrested until three days later, giving her a chance to destroy her papers. The police arrested the prostitute Nicole Le Guay as well as Rétaux de Villette, who confessed that he had written the letters given to Rohan in the queen&#x27;s name and had imitated her signature. The noted Freemason and occultist Alessandro Cagliostro was also arrested although it is doubtful whether he had any part in the affair.

Rohan accepted the Parlement de Paris as judges. Pope Pius VI was incensed, since he believed that Rohan should be tried by his natural judge (himself). However, his notes remained unanswered. A sensational trial resulted in the acquittal of Rohan, Leguay and Cagliostro on 31 May 1786. &quot;Rohan&#x27;s choice of the Parliament, whatever the verdict, both prolonged matters and took them into the political arena&quot;. Jeanne was condemned to whipping, branding with a V (for &quot;voleuse&quot;, &#x27;thief&#x27;) on each shoulder, and sent to life imprisonment in the prostitutes&#x27; prison at the Salpêtrière. In June the following year, she escaped from prison by being disguised as a boy. Meanwhile, her husband was tried &quot;in absentia&quot; and condemned to be a galley slave. The forger Villette was banished. That made the event a matter of public interest, rather than being handled quietly and privately.

Public opinion was much excited by the trial. The Paris Parliament did not comment on the alleged actions of the queen. The trial found Marie Antoinette blameless in the matter, Rohan an innocent dupe, and that de la Mottes deceived both for their own ends. Despite findings to the contrary, many people in France persisted in the belief that the queen used the la Mottes as an instrument to satisfy her hatred of Rohan. Various circumstances fortified that belief: the queen&#x27;s disappointment at Rohan&#x27;s acquittal and the fact that he was afterwards deprived by the king of his charges and exiled to the Abbey of La Chaise-Dieu. In addition, the people assumed that the Parlement of Paris&#x27;s acquittal of Rohan implied that Marie Antoinette had somehow been in the wrong. All of those factors led to a huge decline in the queen&#x27;s popularity and impressed an image of her to the public as a manipulative spendthrift who was more interested in vanity than in the welfare of her people. Jeanne took refuge in London, and in 1789 she published her &quot;Mémoires Justificatifs&quot; in which she once again libelled Queen Marie Antoinette.

==Significance==

The affair of the diamond necklace was important in discrediting the Bourbon monarchy in the eyes of the French people four years before the French Revolution. Marie Antoinette became even more unpopular, and malicious gossip about her made her a greater liability to her husband. After the affair broke out to the general public there was an increase in literature defaming the queen. Her &quot;unpopularity was so great after the Diamond Necklace Affair that it could no longer be ignored by either the queen or the government. Her appearances in public all but ceased.&quot; As she was associated with the scandal and already considered by some to be an enemy of the French people, her reputation was irreversibly destroyed.

Marie Antoinette&#x27;s reputation never recovered from this incident. Her early history of excessive spending had already blemished her popularity, but the Diamond Necklace Affair catapulted public opinion of her into near-hatred, since she appeared to have plotted to misuse more of the kingdom&#x27;s depleting money for personal trinkets. The Diamond Necklace Affair heightened the French general public&#x27;s hatred and disdain for Marie Antoinette since it was &quot;designed to leave the queen in a state of scandal, with the impossibility of claiming any truth for herself&quot;. The public relations nightmare led to an increase in salacious and degrading pamphlets, which would serve as kindling for the oncoming French Revolution. It could be said that &quot;she symbolized, among other things, the lavishness and corruption of a dying regime&quot; and served as &quot;the perfect scapegoat of the morality play that the revolution in part became&quot;, which made her a target for the hatred of the French Republic and groups like the Jacobins and the &quot;sans-culottes&quot;.

She was never able to shake off the idea in public imagination that she had perpetrated an extravagant fraud for her own frivolous ends. Nonetheless, the affair prompted Louis XVI to become closer to his wife and may have inclined him to be more defensive of and more responsive to her before and during the Revolution.

<text>Dannevirke ( &quot;work of the Danes&quot;, a reference to Danevirke; or &quot;Tāmaki-nui-a-Rua&quot;, the area where the town is), is a rural service town in the Manawatū-Whanganui region of the North Island, New Zealand. It is the main centre of the Tararua District.

The surrounding area, a catchment and source of the Manawatū River (approximately 20 Min drive north of town) has developed into dairy, beef cattle and sheep farming, which now provides the major income for the town&#x27;s population of .

==History==

Before European settlers arrived in the 1870s, the line of descent for Māori in the area was from the Kurahaupō waka. The tribe of the area is Rangitāne, with geographic distinction to Te Rangiwhakaewa in the immediate Dannevirke region. The first known &#x27;Aotea&#x27; meeting house was established approximately 15 generations ago (from 2010) followed by the building of a marae at Makirikiri near Dannevirke at about the same time as the first Nordic settlers arrived from Napier and Hawkes Bay.

The town was founded on 15 October 1872 by Danish, Norwegian and Swedish settlers, adherents of Scandinavism, who arrived at the port of Napier and moved inland. The settlers, who arrived under the Public Works Act, built their initial settlement in a clearing of the Seventy Mile Bush.

The Dannevirke after which the town was named is an extensive Viking Age fortification line in Denmark which had a strong emotive symbolic role for 19th-century Danes, especially after the site had fallen into German hands in the German-Danish War of 1864 – a recent and very painful event for these settlers. The settlement quickly earned the nickname of &quot;sleeper town&quot;, as the town&#x27;s purpose was to provide tōtara sleepers for the Napier–Wellington railway line, which had a station in the town from 1884. At one stage the area had 50 operating sawmills. After the native bush was cleared, the land was turned into pasture for grazing animals.

On 27 October 1917, much of the town&#x27;s business district was destroyed by fire. The fire had started in the Andrew&#x27;s Hotel on the corner of High and Station Streets at about 2pm. Flames blew across the road engulfing the Dannevirke Co-operative Association&#x27;s store. As the fire spread through adjoining shops another hotel, the Masonic was engulfed. By about 5pm the Dannevirke and Woodville Fire Brigades, along with assistance from the local community had brought the fires under control. In total 27 business premises and 2 hotels were destroyed with damage estimated at £200,000.

<doc id="203486" wikidata="Q1720351" url="?curid=203486" title="Hub gear">
<text>A hub gear, internal-gear hub, internally geared hub or just gear hub is a gear ratio changing system commonly used on bicycles that is implemented with planetary or epicyclic gears. The gears and lubricants are sealed within the shell of the hub gear, in contrast with derailleur gears where the gears and mechanism are exposed to the elements. Changing the gear ratio was traditionally accomplished by a shift lever connected to the hub with a Bowden cable, and twist-grip style shifters have become common.

Hub gear systems generally have a long and largely maintenance-free life though some are not suitable for high-stress use in competitions or hilly, off-road conditions. Many commuter or urban cycles such as European city bikes are now commonly fitted with 7-speed gear-hubs and 8-speed systems are becoming increasingly available. Older or less costly utility bicycles often use 3-speed gear-hubs, such as in bicycle sharing systems. Many folding bicycles use 3-speed gear-hubs. Modern developments with up to 18 gear ratios are available.

==History==
Before epicyclic gears were used in bicycle hubs, they were used on tricycles. Patents for epicyclic hubs date from the mid-1880s. The first patent for a compact epicyclic hub gear was granted in 1895 to the American machinist Seward Thomas Johnson of Noblesville, Indiana, U.S.A. This was a 2-speed but was not commercially successful.

In 1896, William Reilly of Salford, England patented a 2-speed hub which went into production in 1898 as &#x27;The Hub&#x27;. It was a great success, remaining in production for a decade. It rapidly established the practicality of compact epicyclic hub gears.

By 1902, Reilly had designed a 3-speed hub gear. He parted company with the manufacturer of &#x27;The Hub&#x27; but had signed away to them the intellectual rights to his future gear designs. To circumvent this problem, the patents for Reilly&#x27;s 3-speed were obtained in the name of his colleague, James Archer. Meanwhile, well-known English journalist and inventor Henry Sturmey had also invented a 3-speed hub. In 1903, Frank Bowden, head of the Raleigh Bicycle Company, formed The Three-Speed Gear Syndicate, having obtained the rights to both the Reilly/Archer and Sturmey 3-speeds. Reilly&#x27;s hub went into production as the first Sturmey Archer 3-speed.

In 1902, Mikael Pedersen (who also produced the Dursley Pedersen bicycle) patented a 3-speed hub gear and this was produced in 1903. This was said to be based on the &quot;counter shaft&quot; principle but was arguably an unusual epicyclic gear, in which a second sun was used in place of a ring gear. In 1904 the Fichtel &amp; Sachs company (Germany, Schweinfurt) produced a hub gear under license to Wanderer, and by 1909, there were 14 different 3-speed hub gears on the British market.

By the 1930s, hub gears were used on bicycles all over the world. They were particularly popular in the UK, the Netherlands, the German-speaking countries and Scandinavia. Since the 1970s, they have become much less common in English-speaking countries, but in many parts of northern Europe, where bicycles are regularly used as daily transport rather than merely for sport or leisure, hub gears are still widely used. The cheaper and stronger (but less reliable) derailleur systems, which offer a wider gear range, have now started to appear.

By 1987, Sturmey-Archer made only 3- and 5-speed hubs, and Fichtel &amp; Sachs and Shimano made only 2- and 3-speed hubs. In that year, the first book (apart from service manuals) for some 80 years dealing solely with epicyclic bicycle gears was published. Since then, there has been a slow but steady increase in interest in hub gears, reflected in the wider range of products now available.

In 1995, Sachs introduced the Elan, the first hub gear with 12 speeds, and an overall range of 339%. Three years later, Rohloff came out with the Speedhub 500/14, a gear hub with 14 speeds and a range of 526%, comparable to that of a 27 speed derailleur gear system, and also sufficiently robust and lightweight for mountain biking. In 2007, NuVinci started manufacturing continuously variable transmission (&quot;stepless&quot;) ∞-speed hubs for commuter bicycles, with an increasing range of about 380% (2016).

As of 2008, Sturmey-Archer makes 3-, 5- and 8-speed hubs, SRAM (successor to Fichtel &amp; Sachs) make 3-, 5-, 7- and 9-speeds and Shimano make 3-, 7- and 8-speeds. In February 2010, Shimano announced the introduction of the Shimano Alfine 700, an 11-speed model.

Though most hub gear systems use one rear sprocket, SRAM&#x27;s Dual Drive system combines an epicyclic hub with a multi-speed rear derailleur system to provide a wide-ranging drivetrain concentrated at the rear wheel. In 2010, Canyon presented the &quot;1.442&quot;-concept, a hybrid hub which uses a similar epicyclical/derailleur combination.

Brompton Bicycle have their own design, with a two-speed derailleur coupled to a special three-speed wide-ratio Sturmey-Archer hub, the &quot;BWR&quot; (Brompton Wide Ratio). The system is useful for folding bicycles (where a multiple front chainset could foul the bike&#x27;s folding mechanism), in recumbent bicycles, and cargo bikes (where small wheels and/or increased weight require a wider range of gears with smaller steps). Hub gears have in the past also been used on motorcycles, although this is now rare.

==Principle of operation==

The simplest 3-speed hubs use a single planetary epicyclic gearset. The sun gear (in yellow) is mounted solidly to the axle and is thus fixed relative to the bicycle frame.
* In low gear, the sprocket drives the annulus (in red), and the planet carrier (in green) drives the hub, giving a gear reduction.
* In middle gear, the sprocket drives the hub directly. 
* In high gear, the sprocket drives the planet carrier (in green), and the annulus (in red) drives the hub, resulting in a gear increase.

The hub axle of a hub gear (unlike that of a derailleur system) will carry torque in all gears except direct drive, and so must be securely braced against rotation. While anti-rotation washers between the dropout and axle nut have often proved adequate, wider-ranging modern systems use a reaction arm affixed to the chain stay. Rear wheels with drum brakes (a feature on some commuter bicycles) require a reaction arm anyway.

Most hub gears are operated in a similar manner, with a single twist, trigger or thumb-shifter. An exception is the older style of Sturmey-Archer 5-speed, which used a second shift cable to change between close and wide-range sun gears, effectively giving two 3-speed hubs in one unit. The middle gear in both ranges was direct drive, so there were five distinct gears. They could either be controlled with a special 5-speed shifter which operated both cables, or with a regular 3-speed shifter and a friction shifter.

==Advantages==
* Hub gears are sealed within the hub, which protects them from water, grit, and impacts. Thus hub gears usually require less maintenance and can be more reliable over time than comparable external derailleur gear systems, which may require more adjustments and replacement of parts (front chainrings, rear sprockets, narrow derailleur-chain).
* Hub gears completely avoid the danger of collision with the spokes and wheel-collapse that derailleur systems can suffer.
* Hub gears can change gear ratios when the rear wheel is not rotating. This can be useful for commuter cycling with frequent stops and for mountain biking in rough terrain.
* Hub gears can be simpler to use for inexperienced riders, because there is generally only a single shifter to operate and there are no overlapping gear ratios. By contrast, modern derailleur systems often have two shifters, and require some forethought to avoid problematic gear combinations.
* Hub gears can be manufactured to include a coaster brake (though not all hub gears are available with coaster brakes). This is not possible with derailleur systems, because the chain cannot transmit a backwards pull.
* Hub gears provide a means for shifting gear ratios on drivetrains incompatible with external derailleurs such as belt drives and shaft drives.
* The single chainline allows for a full chain enclosure chain guard, so the chain can be protected from water and grit, and clothing can be protected from contact with the lubricated chain.
* The single chainline does not require the chain to bend or twist. As a result, the chain can be constructed differently, with parallel pins instead of barrel-shaped ones. Line-contact between the bearing surfaces, instead of the point-contact of a derailleur chain, greatly extends the working life of all components.
* On bicycles with fixed chain-lines, no chain tensioner is required, eliminating a part that could otherwise become damaged in rough terrain- an advantage for off-road cyclists. Where a tensioner is required, a short cage is usually sufficient to take up the chain slack.
* The single external sprocket means that the wheel can have a hub with more distance between its flanges and be built with no or much less dish, making it laterally stronger than a similar wheel with narrower flange spacing and more dish to accommodate multiple sprockets. The hub shell of gear hubs is also often of a larger diameter than that of derailleur hubs, meaning the spokes on such wheels may be shorter.

== Disadvantages ==
*It can be hard or impossible to select another gear whilst pedalling, because a release of pressure is required to enable a change in this case. 
*The rear wheel cannot be completely separated from a bicycle with hub gears without also disconnecting the gear cable (and any coaster-brake clamp), which complicates the process of replacing an inner tube (of course, one can still patch an innertube without removing a wheel).
*The hub gear is an integral part of the wheel and it is not possible to change the wheel without also changing the hub gear.
*Hub gears are more complex and usually more difficult for the rider to repair, which is nearly impossible by the roadside.
*Hub gears are typically more expensive than derailleur systems (note: it depends on what you are comparing them with). 
*At commuter/recreational power levels, current hub gears are typically about 10% less efficient than reasonably maintained derailleur gears. (note: some marketing material from tests performed by the manufacturers has the number at 2%, but that is not only false, but impossible. Several tests compared a new internal gear hub with an old and badly-maintained derailleur system, or did not apply any weight on the axle and load into the system. The real numbers are different - the efficiency/losses are closer to that of all planetary gear transmissions.)
*Hub gears tend to be heavier than derailleur systems with equivalent gearing characteristics, and the additional weight is concentrated at the back wheel. For this reason, they are not a primary choice for rear-suspension bicycles in sporting use as the extra unsprung weight may adversely affect traction and braking.
*Hub gears are generally incompatible with quick release mechanisms/skewer axles.
*It is sometimes possible to select no gear when changing gears with a poorly adjusted gear cable, which results in a complete loss of drive.

== Hub gears in everyday use ==
Traditional hub gears are indexed at the shifter, making operation dependent on correct cable tension (and lubrication thereof). In practice, gear-jumping and consequent internal damage are unusual, except in high-mileage units. Modern hub gear-units incorporate the indexing within the unit and are, therefore, unaffected by shifting malfunctions caused in this way.

Most Sturmey-Archer and Fichtel &amp; Sachs &quot;Torpedo&quot; systems default to top gear at slack-cable, which could make the bicycle usable for long-distance travel in flat terrain, even if a fault developed in the change mechanism. It is rather like a derailleur system, which can be manually set to a high gear in case of a similar fault. The very earliest Sturmey-Archer hubs, however, defaulted to low gear. Some modern hub gear systems, e.g., 7-speed Shimano, also default to bottom gear and are thus more dependent on the cable-pull.

==Hybrid gearing with derailleurs==
Some systems combine internally geared hubs with external derailleurs. A freewheeling hub with a sprocket suitable for narrow chain can be combined with a double or triple crankset and front derailleur, in order to provide a wider range and closer gear ratio spacing. A chain tensioner or a rear derailleur is needed to take up chain slack, and care is needed not to over-torque the hub by using too small a chainring/sprocket ratio.

Alternatively, some hubs can accept two dished drive sprockets, between which the rider can switch with a rear derailleur. Careful sprocket selection can allow the available gear ratios when using one sprocket to fall half-way between those available when using the second sprocket, providing half-step gearing, as on the Brompton 6-speed folding bicycle. This concept is used and extended in the SRAM Dual Drive system, where a conventional multi-speed cassette is mounted to a 3-speed hub. A similar version of the ever-popular AW hub is manufactured by Sturmey Archer. This system may be useful on bicycles which cannot accept a front derailleur. The German company Canyon introduced the 1442 in 2010, a hybrid hub which uses a similar epicyclical/derailleur combination.

When both front and rear derailleurs are used with a geared hub, the result is a very wide-ranging drivetrain, at the expense of increased weight and complexity.

A particular use of the dualdrive systems is on recumbent bicycles where starting off from a standstill, or after braking hard, is very difficult if a high gear is engaged. On an upright bicycle, if a high gear is engaged, the rider may use one leg to gain minimal momentum and stand on the pedals and use her/his upper body to balance the bike; this is not possible on a 2-wheeled recumbent bicycle. Here the dualdrive setup allows shifting at a standstill or at low speeds, which is not possible with derailleur gears alone.

==Advanced hub gears==
Advanced hub gears offer a higher number of gears by using multiple epicyclic gears driven by each other. Their ratios are chosen to give more evenly spaced gears and a larger total gear range. The operating principle of such units is the same as with less advanced systems, with a trigger or twist shifter with sequential shifting.

*The 12-speed Sachs Elan was the first hub gear with 10 or more speeds in the market (1995–1999). It was considered heavy and plagued with quality issues, and was discontinued after a few years.
*The 14-speed Rohloff Speedhub hub gear, introduced in 1998, has a range exceeding 5 to 1, and is thus comparable in range to 24, 27 and 30-speed derailleur systems (with 3×8, 3×9 and 3×10 cogs front and rear), since the latter have three overlapping ranges often with only about 14 distinct gears. As there is no overlap with the Speedhub, the hub gear has only two shift directions (up and down), compared to front and rear derailleur gears where two shift operators with two shift directions are needed to shift through all gears.
*The 11-speed Shimano Alfine 700 hub gear, introduced in 2010, has a gear range exceeding 4 to 1, comparable to 20-speed derailleur drive-trains, and internals running in an oil bath, for greater mechanical efficiency.

<text>Pahiatua () is a rural service town in the south-eastern North Island of New Zealand with a population of . It is between Masterton and Woodville on State Highway 2 and along the Wairarapa Line railway, north of Masterton and east of Palmerston North. It is usually regarded as being in the Northern Wairarapa. For local government purposes, since 1989 it has been in the Tararua District, which encompasses Eketāhuna, Pahiatua, Woodvillle, Dannevirke, Norsewood and the far east of the Manawatū-Whanganui region.

== History and culture ==

===19th century===

The Wellington Land Board decided in December 1880 to offer land in the Pahiatua Block for settlement. This consisted of , of which was offered on a deferred payment basis. Applications for the land closed in February the following year, but there seems to have been little interest at first. Sales of land from the original offer continued over the next few years.

The Pahiatua village was not a settlement initiated by the government, but rather one that had its origin in land speculation. Several subdivisions were established by private landholders including W. W. McCardle, H. Manns, A. W. and Henry Sedcole, and W. Wakeman. It is claimed that the first settlers were John Hall, who arrived on 28 February 1881, followed by John Hughes the next day. These men, plus the brothers of Hughes and their families, comprised Pahiatua&#x27;s population the first summer. Precisely when the town of Pahiatua came into being is not clear, as it has not been established when McCardle&#x27;s first land sale took place. However, by the summer of 1883 he was advertising grassed suburban sections, &quot;improved&quot; acres, and other unimproved lots. In November 1885, he sought to dispose of a large portion of one of his subdivisions at an auction in Napier.
Development of the land quickly produced results, and by August 1883, had been cleared, several hundred heads of cattle were being grazed, and the population stood at 150. The efforts of the early settlers were sufficient to attract storekeepers and even a hotel.

The government belatedly decided to get involved and agreed to survey a township reserve in December 1882. They later changed their minds and postponed any decision, citing the need to wait for the final determination of the route of the railway. The settlers, also desirous of being close to the railway to improve land values, made strenuous efforts to have the line run through the town, but like their southern counterparts in Greytown, were ultimately unsuccessful. The legacy of this plan can be seen today in the unusual width of Pahiatua&#x27;s Main Street, which was designed to accommodate the railway down the centre. The intended railway reserve became a grassed median after it was decided to build the railway line to the west of the town.

In 1981, Pahiatua celebrated its centennial with a weekend full of historical events, and in 2006 its 125th anniversary with a grand parade of 125 floats, vehicles and horses.

===Naming of the town===

The town was named by its founder, William Wilson McCardle. &quot;Pahiatua&quot; was already the name of the wider Pahiatua Block. When translated from Māori, &quot;Pahiatua&quot; can mean &quot;god&#x27;s resting place&quot;. The explanation accompanying this translation is that a chief fleeing from his enemies was led by his war god to this hill to seek refuge.

===20th century===

Historical population counts show a steady increase in the size of the town throughout most of the 20th century.
Pahiatua was the location of one of New Zealand&#x27;s most powerful earthquakes when on 5 March 1934 a magnitude 7.6 quake struck at Horoeka. The 1934 Pahiatua earthquake was felt as far away as Auckland and Dunedin.
On 1 November 1944, 838 Polish refugees, of which 733 were children, were sent to a refugee camp about south of the town. The camp had been used as an internment camp for foreigners at the start of World War II. The camp even had a Polish elementary school (until 1949) and a Polish gymnasium (until 1946). The settlement was expected to be a temporary measure, but with the occupation of Central Europe, including Poland, by the Soviet Union and its subsequent imposition of communist regimes after the end of the war, the refugees stayed on at the camp until 1949 at which point they were naturalised.

In 1951, the camp was used for over 900 refugees from Central and Eastern Europe.

In 2004, the New Zealand Polish community celebrated its 60th anniversary and the 65th anniversary celebrations were held in 2009 at which former Polish president Lech Wałęsa was to have been the guest of honour. The local museum opened a new exhibit in 2017 to tell the story of the refugees&#x27; experience in New Zealand.

===21st century===

The estimated population of Pahiatua reached 2,760 in 1996, 2,660 in 2001, 2,547 in 2006, 2,403 in 2013, and 2,682 in 2018.

Average residential property prices increased 43% between 2005 and 2008.

==Geography==

Pahiatua covers an area of 3.86 km², all of it land.

===Climate===

==Amenities==

===Marae===

Pahiatua Marae, featuring Te Kohanga Whakawhaiti meeting house, is a traditional meeting place for Rangitāne and its Ngāti Hāmua and Te Kapuārangi sub-tribes. It includes Te Kohanga Whakawhaiti &quot;wharenui&quot; (meeting house).

===Museums===

Pahiatua &amp; Districts Museum opened in 1977.

Pahiatua Railcar Society has been operating since 1991.

== Demographics ==
Pahiatua covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Pahiatua had a population of 2,682 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 279 people (11.6%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 135 people (5.3%) since the 2006 census. There were 1,053 households, comprising 1,269 males and 1,413 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.9 males per female. The median age was 40.4 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 603 people (22.5%) aged under 15 years, 429 (16.0%) aged 15 to 29, 1,092 (40.7%) aged 30 to 64, and 561 (20.9%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 87.6% European/Pākehā, 23.5% Māori, 2.5% Pasifika, 2.5% Asian, and 2.1% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 9.4, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 46.3% had no religion, 41.7% were Christian, 1.6% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.4% were Hindu, 0.1% were Muslim, 0.3% were Buddhist and 1.6% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 192 (9.2%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 621 (29.9%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $23,900, compared with $31,800 nationally. 216 people (10.4%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 825 (39.7%) people were employed full-time, 312 (15.0%) were part-time, and 114 (5.5%) were unemployed.

==Economy==

The economy is based on support for sheep and beef farming and the dairy industry, with the Fonterra Dairy factory in Mangamutu and Tui Brewery in Mangatainoka, both located just outside the town. Other major employers include Betacraft and Sweet Foods, located in the town itself.

In 2018, 16.9% of the workforce worked in manufacturing, 5.8% worked in construction, 5.0% worked in hospitality, 3.4% worked in transport, 7.9% worked in education, and 9.8% worked in healthcare.

==Government==

The residents of Pahiatua were politically active from early on, advocating for their own Roads Board around June 1883. By August 1886, Pahiatua had gained town district status and only two years later, in October 1888, the Pahiatua County Council was established. The town was constituted as a borough on 25 July 1892. The council remained the political master of the town and surrounding area until the local government reforms of 1989 merged the town into the Tararua District Council.

At central government level, Pahiatua was located in the Wairarapa seat until 1881, at which point the electorate was split into Wairarapa North and Wairarapa South (later to become Masterton and Wairarapa respectively in 1887). Part of the Masterton seat was divided off into the new Pahiatua seat in 1896, which remained the political home of Pahiatua until the electorate was amalgamated with the Wairarapa seat in 1996.

The settlement is now part of Tararua District (led by mayor ), the Wairarapa electorate (represented by ) and Ikaroa-Rāwhiti electorate (represented by ).

== Transportation ==

As of 2018, among those who commute to work, 71.0% drove a car, 4.7% rode in a car, 2.9% use a bike, and 2.9% walk or run. No one commuted by public transport.

The town&#x27;s public transport now consists of a single trip from Tuesday to Friday and on Sunday Masterton – Palmerston North and return bus service (with an extra service on Fridays) run by Tranzit Coachlines.
An electric tramway system was considered for Pahiatua, but never constructed.

Rail transport to Pahiatua was available from 3 May 1897 when the town&#x27;s railway station opened, marking the completion of the Wairarapa Line as far north as the town. The line was completed through to Pahiatua&#x27;s northern neighbour, Woodville, several months later, on 11 December 1897. Improvements made to the region&#x27;s road network in the latter half of the 20th century led to a decline in the popularity of rail for public transport. The service was finally withdrawn in 1988 when the last passenger train between Palmerston North and Masterton stopped at Pahiatua on Friday, 29 July.

Pahiatua is the home of the Pahiatua Railcar Society, a non-profit railway heritage organisation based at the town&#x27;s railway station, whose purpose is to preserve and restore to working order railcars formerly in revenue service on New Zealand&#x27;s railway network. Some of the notable vehicles in their collection include a Standard class railcar (RM31), a Wairarapa class railcar (RM5), and a Twin Set railcar (RM121). The society leases the railway station from KiwiRail and opens their museum to the public once a month.

== Healthcare ==

Pahiatua had its own hospital, located on a site at the southern end of the town, since 1902. In November 1997, the hospital, then under the jurisdiction of Palmerston North-based Mid Central Health, was informed that it would soon close as the Health Funding Authority could no longer afford to keep it open. This was despite numerous assurances given to the town from 1992 by successive health authorities that the hospital was in no danger of being closed. The closure date was set at 30 June 1998, by which time the only services offered by the hospital were an x-ray department, maternity, a general ward, and geriatric, palliative, convalescent, and rehabilitation care. However, part of the complex remained open until the last patients could be relocated to a new facility at Waireka Home that was still under construction.

Following the closure of the hospital in 1998, hospital-level care has been provided at Palmerston North hospital as the town is in the jurisdiction of Mid Central Health.

Also, after the closing of the town&#x27;s hospital was the establishment of the Pahiatua Medical Centre, which now dispenses general practice health care to the town&#x27;s residents and, via outreach clinics, to residents of Eketahuna and Woodville. It is run by the Tararua PHO (Primary Health Organisation).

The old Pahiatua hospital complex has been refurbished and converted into a private conference and accommodation business called Masters Hall.

== Communications ==

The area code for Pahiatua is 06 as for telecommunications purposes it is part of the Manawatu-Wairarapa-Hawkes Bay region in the lower North Island. Local numbers generally begin with 376, with the next digit being 0, 6, 7 or 8.

The Tararua District Council formed an alliance with the telecommunications companies Inspire Net, Inspired Networks, Digital Nation and FX Networks to link the four major towns in its jurisdiction to Palmerston North with a fibre optic cable. The link between Palmerston North and Pahiatua was expected to go live on 31 July 2008. The service is now available to some rural residents and urban customers. As of 2023, fibre internet is available to customers in Pahiatua after extensive infrastructure updates were made by Chorus.

Tararua College is one of 14 schools nationwide set to become the first to benefit from the government&#x27;s broadband in schools initiative. Funding of $34 million has been allocated for the programme, of which the schools will receive $5 million for upgrades to their information technology equipment.

=== Media ===
Free-to-air television broadcasts are available in Pahiatua, including the major national channels offered by TVNZ and Prime from Sky Television. Also available is digital television from both Sky Television (via satellite) and Freeview (either via UHF terrestrial broadcasts or by satellite).

Pahiatua is the home of the regional television station Tararua Television. The founders Hart Udy and Jonathan McLean had a vision to broadcast free-to-air family-friendly television programs, and the vision came to life. The channel began in a studio at Tararua College in 2004 and officially opened by Martin Matthews, CEO of Culture and Heritage. The studio then moved to Pahiatua Christian Fellowship, where they produced their first live program, celebrating their first birthday. At that time, TTV was broadcasting to an audience of approximately 5,000 in Pahiatua and Woodville. A local fund-raising effort enabled the station to increase its coverage to Palmerston North, Foxton, Bulls, Marton, Feilding and Ashhurst and a ceremony to mark the occasion was held on 1 May 2008.

With the switch off of analogue television services within the Manawatu-Whanganui Region on 29 September 2013 and to ensure business continuity, Tararua Television has secured resource consent and licensing to broadcast on DTV27 via Freeview from its own stand-alone transmission site on Wharite capturing a potential primary audience exceeding 133,000 throughout the Manawatu-Whanganui Region predominantly in the Manawatu, Horowhenua, Rangitikei and Tararua districts. From small beginnings, Tararua Television continually strives to succeed and grow within an environment dominated by mainstream television and today is a force to be reckoned with. Locally owned and operated Tararua Television provides an alternative viewing platform of locally produced community-focused and family-safe television programmes from throughout the region that involve the community yet are non-judgmental. Tararua Television is a member of the Regional Broadcasters Association (RTB) and is the only regional television station between Nelson in the south to Hawke&#x27;s Bay in the East and Central TV Matamata in the North.

When the Tararua District moved to digital TV transmission in 2013, the TTV directors reluctantly closed the Tararua Television station because of financial constraints.

== Education ==

Tararua College, a co-educational state secondary school, is located in Pahiatua. It was established in 1960, and has a roll of as of .

Pahiatua School is a co-educational state primary school, with a roll of .

St Anthony&#x27;s School is a co-educational state-integrated Catholic primary school, with a roll of .

A consultation document proposing the reorganisation of educational facilities in the Tararua District was released by the Bush Education Plan working group in July 2009. Amongst its recommendations was the closure of several schools in the district, such as Hillcrest School, and for their rolls to be merged into other schools, such as Pahiatua School. The plan was scrapped a month later when the working group was dissolved after a vitriolic response from local residents and a statement from the Minister of Education that she had no plans to close any schools in the region against the wishes of the local community.

==Town facilities==

Unusual for a town of its size, Pahiatua has retained several amenities that were lost to similar towns around New Zealand in the 1980s and 1990s, including banking, postal services and a cinema, the Regent Theatre.

Originally built by Kerridge Theatres NZ in 1940, the 600-seat Regent closed in 1977 and was purchased by the Pahiatua Repertory Society, who converted it into a 230-seat cinema in the upstairs area and a 220-seat live theatre facility in the downstairs area. At that time, the name was changed to Upstairs Downstairs Theatre. In 2001, an extensive restoration of the facade and foyer took place and the building&#x27;s name reverted to the original name, the Regent. In 2015, the cinema converted from 35mm projection to a fully compliant DCI digital projection. Still owned by the Pahiatua Repertory Society, today it operates as two separate entities: The Pahiatua Upstairs Cinema Society (a registered charity) and the Pahiatua Repertory Society Incorporated (also a registered charity).

In 2021, Westpac Bank closed its Pahiatua branch, leaving the town with no full banking facilities. However, Kiwibank operates a banking agency at the NZ Post Shop at 91 Main Street, Pahiatua. The town is also served by a public swimming pool, an extensive sports complex, a supermarket, a Kohanga Reo, two kindergartens, an Early Childhood Centre, two primary schools, a secondary school, a volunteer fire brigade, and a public library.

The town has both a hotel and a motel.

<doc id="203499" wikidata="Q76881" url="?curid=203499" title="Gustav Fechner">
<text>Gustav Theodor Fechner (; ; 19 April 1801 – 18 November 1887) was a German physicist, philosopher, and experimental psychologist. A pioneer in experimental psychology and founder of psychophysics (techniques for measuring the mind), he inspired many 20th-century scientists and philosophers. He is also credited with demonstrating the non-linear relationship between psychological sensation and the physical intensity of a stimulus via the formula: formula_1, which became known as the Weber–Fechner law.

== Early life and scientific career ==
Fechner was born at Groß Särchen, near Muskau, in Lower Lusatia, where his father, a maternal uncle, and his paternal grandfather were pastors. His mother, Johanna Dorothea Fechner (b. 1774), née Fischer, also came from a religious family. Some biographers consider, that despite these religious influences, Fechner became an atheist in later life, while the others says that Fechner had his own religious system as a synthesis of Christianity and paganism. 

Fechner&#x27;s father, Samuel Traugott Fischer Fechner (1765-1806) was free-thinking in many ways, for example by having his children be vaccinated, teaching them Latin, and being a passionate grower of fruit. He died unexpectedly in 1806, leaving the family destitute. Fechner had an elder brother, Eduard Clemens Fechner (1799-1861) and three younger sisters: Emilie, Clementine, and Mathilde. Fechner and his brother were then raised for a few years by his maternal uncle—the pastor, before being reunited with his mother and sisters in Dresden.

Fechner was educated first at Sorau (now Żary in Western Poland).

In 1817 Fechner studied medicine for six months at the in Dresden and from 1818 at the University of Leipzig, the city in which he spent the rest of his life. He earned his PhD from Leipzig in 1823.

In 1834 he was appointed professor of physics at Leipzig. But in 1839, he injured his eyes in the research on afterimages by gazing at the Sun through colored glasses, while studying the phenomena of color and vision, and, after much suffering, resigned. Subsequently, recovering, he turned to the study of the mind and its relations with the body, giving public lectures on the subjects dealt with in his books. Whilst lying in bed, Fechner had an insight into the relationship between mental sensations and material sensations. This insight proved to be significant in the development of psychology as there was now a quantitative relationship between the mental and physical worlds.

== Contributions ==

Fechner published chemical and physical papers, and translated chemical works by Jean-Baptiste Biot and Louis Jacques Thénard from French. He also wrote several poems and humorous pieces, such as the &quot;Vergleichende Anatomie der Engel&quot; (1825), written under the pseudonym of &quot;Dr. Mises.&quot;

=== Elemente der Psychophysik ===

Fechner&#x27;s epoch-making work was his &quot;Elemente der Psychophysik&quot; (1860). He started from the monistic thought that bodily facts and conscious facts, though not reducible one to the other, are different sides of one reality. His originality lies in trying to discover an exact mathematical relation between them. The most famous outcome of his inquiries is the law known as &quot;Fechner&#x27;s Law&quot;, which may be expressed as follows:

:&quot;In order that the intensity of a sensation may increase in arithmetical progression, the stimulus must increase in geometrical progression.&quot;

The law has been found to be immensely useful, but to fail for very faint and for very strong sensations. Within its useful range, Fechner&#x27;s law is that sensation is a logarithmic function of physical intensity. S. S. Stevens pointed out that such a law does not account for the fact that perceived relationships among stimuli (e.g., papers coloured black, dark grey, grey, light grey, and white) are unchanged with changes in overall intensity (i.e., in the level of illumination of the papers). He proposed, in his famous 1961 paper entitled &quot;To Honor Fechner and Repeal His Law&quot;, that intensity of stimulation is related to perception via a power-law.

Fechner&#x27;s general formula for getting at the number of units in any sensation is &quot;S&quot; = &quot;c&quot; log &quot;R&quot;, where &quot;S&quot; stands for the sensation, &quot;R&quot; for the stimulus numerically estimated, and &quot;c&quot; for a constant that must be separately determined by experiment in each particular order of sensibility. Fechner&#x27;s reasoning has been criticized on the grounds that although stimuli are composite, sensations are not. &quot;Every sensation,&quot; says William James, &quot;presents itself as an indivisible unit; and it is quite impossible to read any clear meaning into the notion that they are masses of units combined.&quot;

=== The Fechner color effect ===

In 1838, he also studied the still-mysterious perceptual illusion of what is still called the Fechner color effect, whereby colors are seen in a moving pattern of black and white. The English journalist and amateur scientist Charles Benham, in 1894, enabled English-speakers to learn of the effect through the invention of the spinning top that bears his name, Benham&#x27;s top. Whether Fechner and Benham ever actually met face to face is not known.

=== The median ===
In his &quot;Vorschule der Aesthetik&quot; (1876) he used the method of extreme ranks for subjective judgements. Two years later he published a paper which developed the notion of the median and is generally credited with introducing the median into the formal analysis of data. He later explored experimental aesthetics and attempted to determine the shapes and dimensions of aesthetically pleasing objects, using as a database the sizes of paintings.

=== Synesthesia ===
In 1871, Fechner reported the first empirical survey of coloured letter photisms among 73 synesthetes. His work was followed in the 1880s by that of Francis Galton.

=== Corpus callosum split ===
One of Fechner&#x27;s speculations about consciousness dealt with brain. During his time, it was known that the brain is bilaterally symmetrical and that there is a deep division between the two halves that are linked by a connecting band of fibers called the corpus callosum. Fechner speculated that if the corpus callosum were split, two separate streams of consciousness would result - the mind would become two. Yet, Fechner believed that his theory would never be tested; he was incorrect. During the mid-twentieth century, Roger Sperry and Michael Gazzaniga worked on epileptic patients with sectioned corpus callosum and observed that Fechner&#x27;s idea was correct.

=== Golden section hypothesis ===
Fechner constructed ten rectangles with different ratios of width to length and asked numerous observers to choose the &quot;best&quot; and &quot;worst&quot; rectangle shape. He was concerned with the visual appeal of rectangles with different proportions. Participants were explicitly instructed to disregard any associations that they have with the rectangles, e.g. with objects of similar ratios. The rectangles chosen as &quot;best&quot; by the largest number of participants and as &quot;worst&quot; by the fewest participants had a ratio of 0.62 (21:34). This ratio is known as the &quot;golden section&quot; (or golden ratio) and referred to the ratio of a rectangle&#x27;s width to length that is most appealing to the eye. Carl Stumpf was a participant in this study.

However, there has been some ongoing dispute on the experiment itself, as the fact that Fechner deliberately discarded results of the study ill-fitting to his needs became known, with many mathematicians, including Mario Livio, refuting the result of the experiment.

=== The two-piece normal distribution ===
In his posthumously published &quot;Kollektivmasslehre&quot; (1897), Fechner introduced the Zweiseitige Gauss&#x27;sche Gesetz or two-piece normal distribution, to accommodate the asymmetries he had observed in empirical frequency distributions in many fields. The distribution has been independently rediscovered by several authors working in different fields.

=== Fechner&#x27;s paradox ===

In 1861, Fechner reported that if he looked at a light with a darkened piece of glass over one eye then closed that eye, the light appeared to become brighter, even though less light was coming into his eyes. This phenomenon has come to be called Fechner&#x27;s paradox. It has been the subject of numerous research papers, including in the 2000s. It occurs because the perceived brightness of the light with both eyes open is similar to the average brightness of each light viewed with one eye.

== Influence ==

Fechner, along with Wilhelm Wundt and Hermann von Helmholtz, is recognized as one of the founders of modern experimental psychology. His clearest contribution was the demonstration that because the mind was susceptible to measurement and mathematical treatment, psychology had the potential to become a quantified science. Theorists such as Immanuel Kant had long stated that this was impossible, and that therefore, a science of psychology was also impossible.

Though he had a vast influence on psychophysics, the actual disciples of his general philosophy were few. Ernst Mach was inspired by his work on psychophysics. William James also admired his work: in 1904, he wrote an admiring introduction to the English translation of Fechner&#x27;s &quot;Büchlein vom Leben nach dem Tode&quot; (&quot;Little Book of Life After Death&quot;).

The composer Gustav Mahler read Fechner as a student, and he identified with Fechner when writing his Second Symphony, his Third, and Das Lied von der Erde.

Furthermore, he influenced Sigmund Freud, who refers to Fechner when introducing the concept of psychic locality in his &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; that he illustrates with the microscope-metaphor.
Fechner&#x27;s world concept was highly animistic. He felt the thrill of life everywhere, in plants, earth, stars, the total universe. Fechner was a panpsychist; he viewed the entire universe as being inwardly alive and consciously animated, instead of being dead “stuff” as accepted by most of his contemporary colleagues, who had become devotees to what was becoming known as material science. Yet he based his panpsychism on a well thought out description of consciousness as waves. He believed that human beings stand midway between the souls of plants and the souls of stars, who are angels. God, the soul of the universe, must be conceived as having an existence analogous to human beings. Natural laws are just the modes of the unfolding of God&#x27;s perfection. In his last work Fechner, aged but full of hope, contrasts this joyous &quot;daylight view&quot; of the world with the dead, dreary &quot;night view&quot; of materialism. Fechner&#x27;s work in aesthetics is also important. He conducted experiments to show that certain abstract forms and proportions are naturally pleasing to our senses, and gave some new illustrations of the working of aesthetic association. Charles Hartshorne saw him as a predecessor on his and Alfred North Whitehead&#x27;s philosophy and regretted that Fechner&#x27;s philosophical work had been neglected for so long.

Fechner&#x27;s position in reference to predecessors and contemporaries is not very sharply defined. He was remotely a disciple of Schelling, learned much from Baruch Spinoza, G. W. Leibniz, Johann Friedrich Herbart, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Christian Hermann Weisse, and decidedly rejected G. W. F. Hegel and the monadism of Rudolf Hermann Lotze.

Fechner&#x27;s work continues to have an influence on modern science, inspiring continued exploration of human perceptual abilities by researchers such as Jan Koenderink, Farley Norman, David Heeger, and others.

== Honours ==

=== Fechner Crater ===

In 1970, the International Astronomical Union named the Fechner crater on the far side of the Moon after Fechner.

=== Fechner Day ===
In 1985 the International Society for Psychophysics called its annual conference &quot;Fechner Day&quot;. The conference is now scheduled to include 22 October to allow psychophysicists to celebrate the anniversary of Fechner&#x27;s waking up on that day in 1850 with a new approach into how to study the mind. Fechner Day runs annually with the 2021 Fechner Day being the 37th. It is organized annually, by a different academic host each year. During the pandemic resulting from COVID-19, Fechner Day was held online in 2020 and 2021.

==Family and later life ==
Little is known of Fechner&#x27;s later years, nor of the circumstances, cause, and manner of his death.

Fechner was the brother of painter Eduard Clemens Fechner and of Clementine Wieck Fechner, who was the stepmother of Clara Wieck when Clementine became her father Friedrich Wieck&#x27;s second wife.

<text>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is the debut studio album by English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 4 August 1967 by EMI Columbia. It is the only Pink Floyd album made under the leadership of founder member Syd Barrett (lead vocals, guitar); he wrote all but three tracks, with additional composition by members Roger Waters (bass, vocals), Nick Mason (drums), and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). The album followed the band&#x27;s influential performances at London&#x27;s UFO Club and their early chart success with the 1967 non-album singles &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; and &quot;See Emily Play&quot;.

The album was recorded at EMI Studios in London&#x27;s Abbey Road from February to May 1967 and produced by Norman Smith. It blended Pink Floyd&#x27;s reputation for long-form improvisational pieces with Barrett&#x27;s short pop songs and whimsical take on psychedelia. The album made prominent use of recording effects such as reverb and echo, employing tools such as EMT plate reverberation, automatic double tracking (ADT), and Abbey Road&#x27;s echo chamber. Part-way through the recording sessions, Barrett&#x27;s growing use of the psychedelic drug LSD accompanied his increasingly debilitated mental state, leading to his eventual departure from the group the following year. The album title was derived from referencing the god Pan in chapter seven of Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s 1908 children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, a favourite of Barrett&#x27;s.

The album was released to critical and commercial success, reaching number 6 on the UK Albums Chart. In the United States, it was released as &quot;Pink Floyd&quot; in October on Tower Records with an altered track listing that omitted three songs and included &quot;See Emily Play&quot;. In the UK, no singles were released from the album, but in the US, &quot;Flaming&quot; was offered as a single. Two of its songs, &quot;Astronomy Dominé&quot; and &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;, became long-term mainstays of the band&#x27;s live setlist, while other songs were performed live only a handful of times. In 1973, &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; was packaged with the band&#x27;s second album &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; (1968) and released as &quot;A Nice Pair&quot;, to introduce the band&#x27;s early work to new fans gained with the success of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973).

The album has since been hailed as a pivotal psychedelic music recording. Special limited editions of &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; were issued to mark its 30th, 40th, and 50th anniversaries, with the former two releases containing bonus tracks. In 2012, &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; was placed at number 347 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, moved up to number 253 in the 2020 edition.

== Background ==
Architecture students Roger Waters, Nick Mason and Richard Wright and art student Syd Barrett had performed under various group names since 1962, and began touring as &quot;The Pink Floyd Sound&quot; in 1965. Around 1966, the group began to achieve underground success for their influential performances at London&#x27;s UFO Club. They turned professional on 1 February 1967 when they signed with EMI, with an advance fee of £5,000. Their first single, a song about a kleptomaniac transvestite titled &quot;Arnold Layne&quot;, was released on 11 March to mild controversy, as Radio London refused to air it.

About three weeks later, the band were introduced to the mainstream media. EMI&#x27;s press release claimed that the band were &quot;musical spokesmen for a new movement which involves experimentation in all the arts&quot;, but EMI attempted to put some distance between them and the underground scene from which the band originated by stating that &quot;the Pink Floyd does not know what people mean by psychedelic pop and are not trying to create hallucinatory effects on their audiences.&quot; The band returned to Sound Techniques studio to record their next single, &quot;See Emily Play&quot;, on 18 May. The single was released almost a month later, on 16 June, and reached number six in the charts.

Pink Floyd picked up a tabloid reputation for making music for LSD users. The popular broadsheet &quot;News of the World&quot; printed a story nine days before the album&#x27;s recording sessions began, saying that &quot;The Pink Floyd group specialise in &#x27;psychedelic music&#x27;, which is designed to illustrate LSD experiences.&quot; Contrary to this image, only Barrett was known to be taking LSD; authors Ray B. Browne and Pat Browne contend that he was the &quot;only real drug user in the band&quot;.

== Recording ==
Pink Floyd&#x27;s record deal was a £5,000 advance over five years, low royalties and no free studio time, which was poor by today&#x27;s standards, but typical for the time. It included album development, which was very unusual; EMI, unsure of exactly what kind of band they had signed, gave them free rein to record whatever they wanted.

They recorded the album at EMI&#x27;s Abbey Road Studios in London and their recording room was next to the Beatles&#x27; recording room where the Beatles were recording the album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. Pink Floyd sat in on one Beatles session for the song &quot;Lovely Rita&quot;. &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; was overseen by producer Norman Smith, a central figure in Pink Floyd&#x27;s negotiations with EMI. Balance engineer Pete Bown, who had mentored Smith, helped ensure that the album had a unique sound, through his experimentation with equipment and recording techniques. Bown, assisted by studio manager David Harris, set up microphones an hour before the sessions began. Bown&#x27;s microphone choices were mostly different from those used by Smith to record the Beatles&#x27; EMI sessions. Because of the quietness of Barrett&#x27;s singing, he was placed in a vocal isolation booth to sing his parts. Automatic double tracking (ADT) was used to add layers of echo to the vocals and to some instruments. The album features an unusually heavy use of echo and reverb to create a unique sound. Much of the reverb came from a set of Elektro-Mess-Technik plate reverberators – customised EMT 140s containing thin metal plates under tension – and the studio&#x27;s tiled echo chamber built in 1931.

The album is made up of two different classes of songs: lengthy improvisations from the band&#x27;s live performances and shorter songs that Barrett had written. Barrett&#x27;s LSD intake escalated part-way through the album&#x27;s recording sessions. Although in his 2005 autobiography Mason recalled the sessions as relatively trouble-free, Smith disagreed and claimed that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. In an attempt to build a relationship with the band, Smith played jazz on the piano while the band joined in. These jam sessions worked well with Waters, who was apparently helpful, and Wright, who was &quot;laid-back&quot;. Smith&#x27;s attempts to connect with Barrett were less productive: &quot;With Syd, I eventually realised I was wasting my time.&quot; Smith later admitted that his traditional ideas of music were somewhat at odds with the psychedelic background from which Pink Floyd had come. Nevertheless, he managed to &quot;discourage the live ramble&quot;, as band manager Peter Jenner called it, guiding the band toward producing songs with a more manageable length.

Barrett would end up writing eight of the album&#x27;s songs and contributing to two instrumentals credited to the whole band, with Waters creating the sole remaining composition &quot;Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk&quot;. Mason recalled how the album &quot;was recorded in what one might call the old-fashioned way: rather quickly. As time went by we started spending longer and longer.&quot;

Recording started on 21 February with six takes of &quot;Matilda Mother&quot;, then called &quot;Matilda&#x27;s Mother&quot;. The following week, on the 27th, the band recorded five takes of &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;, and &quot;Chapter 24&quot;. On 16 March, the band had another go at recording &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;, in an attempt to create a shorter version, and &quot;Flaming&quot; (originally titled &quot;Snowing&quot;), which was recorded in a single take with one vocal overdub. On 19 March, six takes of &quot;The Gnome&quot; were recorded. The following day, the band recorded Waters&#x27; &quot;Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk&quot;. On 21 March, the band were invited to watch the Beatles record &quot;Lovely Rita&quot;. The following day, they recorded &quot;The Scarecrow&quot; in one take. The next three tracks – &quot;Astronomy Dominé&quot;, &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; and &quot;Pow R. Toc H.&quot; – were worked on extensively between 21 March and 12 April, having originally been lengthy instrumentals. Between 12 and 18 April, the band recorded &quot;Percy the Rat Catcher&quot; and a currently unreleased track called &quot;She Was a Millionaire&quot;.

&quot;Percy the Rat Catcher&quot; received overdubs across five studio sessions and then was mixed in late June, eventually being given the name &quot;Lucifer Sam&quot;. Songwriting for the majority of the album is credited solely to Barrett, with tracks such as &quot;Bike&quot; having been written in late 1966 before the album was started. &quot;Bike&quot; was recorded on 21 May 1967 and originally entitled &quot;The Bike Song&quot;. By June, Barrett&#x27;s increasing LSD use during the recording project left him looking visibly debilitated.

== Release ==
In June 1967, before the album was released, the single &quot;See Emily Play&quot; was sold as a 7-inch 45 rpm record, with &quot;The Scarecrow&quot; on the B-side, listed as &quot;Scarecrow&quot;. The full album was released on 4 August 1967, including &quot;The Scarecrow&quot;.

Pink Floyd continued to perform at the UFO Club, drawing huge crowds, but Barrett&#x27;s deterioration caused them serious concern. The band initially hoped that his erratic behaviour was a phase that would pass, but others, including manager Peter Jenner and his secretary June Child, were more realistic:

To the band&#x27;s consternation, they were forced to cancel their appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, informing the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Jenner and Waters arranged for Barrett to see a psychiatrist – a meeting he did not attend. He was sent to relax in the sun on the Spanish island of Formentera with Waters and Sam Hutt (a doctor well-established in the underground music scene), but this led to no visible improvement.
The original UK LP was released on 4 August 1967 in both monaural and stereophonic mixes. It reached number six on the UK charts. The original US album appeared on the Tower division of Capitol on 21 October 1967. This version was officially titled simply &quot;Pink Floyd&quot;, though the original album title did appear on the back cover as on the UK issue, and Dick Clark referred to the record by its original title when the group appeared on his &quot;American Bandstand&quot; television program on 18 November. The US album featured an abbreviated track listing, and reached number 131 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. The UK single, &quot;See Emily Play&quot;, was substituted for &quot;Astronomy Dominé&quot;, &quot;Flaming&quot; and &quot;Bike&quot;. Released in time for the band&#x27;s US tour, &quot;Flaming&quot; was released as a single, backed with &quot;The Gnome&quot;. The Tower issue of the album also faded out &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; and broke up the segue into &quot;The Gnome&quot; to fit the re-sequencing of the songs. Later US issues on compact disc had the same title and track list as the UK version. The album was certified Gold in the US as a part of &quot;A Nice Pair&quot; with &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; on 11 March 1994.

About being handled on Tower Records, Jenner commented that: &quot;In terms of the U.K. and Europe it was always fine. America was always difficult. Capitol couldn&#x27;t see it. You know, &#x27;What is this latest bit of rubbish from England? Oh Christ, it&#x27;ll give us more grief, so we&#x27;ll put it out on Tower Records&#x27;, which was a subsidiary of Capitol Records [...] It was a very cheapskate operation and it was the beginning of endless problems The Floyd had with Capitol. It started off bad and went on being bad.&quot;

Up-and-coming society photographer Vic Singh was hired to photograph the band for the album cover. Singh shared a studio with photographer David Bailey, and he was friends with Beatles guitarist George Harrison. Singh asked Jenner and King to dress the band in the brightest clothes they could find. Singh then shot them with a prism lens that Harrison had given him. The cover was meant to resemble an LSD trip, a style that was favoured at the time. In 2017, the lens was displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum, as part of the &quot;Pink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains&quot; exhibition.

Barrett came up with the album title &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;; the album was originally titled &quot;Projection&quot; up to as late as July 1967. The title was taken from that of chapter seven of Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; which contains a visionary encounter with the god Pan, who plays his pan pipe at dawn. It was one of Barrett&#x27;s favourite books, and he often gave friends the impression that he was the embodiment of Pan. The moniker was later used in the song &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;, in which Barrett is called &quot;you Piper&quot;. The cover was one of several Pink Floyd album covers used on a series of Royal Mail stamps issued in May 2016 to commemorate 50 years of Pink Floyd.

In 2018, the album was reissued in its mono mix. With this version came with a new packaging box with the original record cover inside. This new design was done by Hipgnosis&#x27; Aubrey Powell and Peter Curzon and includes a gold-embossed version of the graphic by Syd Barrett which features on the back cover of the original LP.

=== Critical reception ===
At the time of release, both &quot;Record Mirror&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; gave the album four stars out of five. &quot;Record Mirror&quot; commented that &quot;[t]he psychedelic image of the group really comes to life, record wise, on this LP which is a fine showcase for both their talent and the recording technique. Plenty of mind blowing sound, both blatant and subtle here, and the whole thing is extremely well performed.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; called it &quot;a particularly striking collection of driving, up-to-date rock ventures&quot;. Paul McCartney and Pink Floyd&#x27;s previous producer Joe Boyd both rated the album highly. Some voiced the opinion of the underground fans, by suggesting that the album did not reflect the band&#x27;s live performances.
==Legacy==

&quot;When I first heard their music, I wasn&#x27;t terribly impressed,&quot; recalled then-EMI employee Alan Parsons. &quot;I was working at &quot;[EMI&#x27;s headquarters]&quot; Hayes and the &quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; album came to me for duplication. And I was thinking if this was to be the music of the future, I wasn&#x27;t looking forward to it. But, like a lot of stuff, you get to like bits of it over a long period.&quot;

In 1999, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5, calling it &quot;the golden achievement of Syd Barrett&quot;. In 2003, it was ranked number 347 on the magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, maintaining that rank in the 2012 update and climbing to number 253 in the 2020 reboot of the list. 

&quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; is hailed as a psychedelic masterpiece and LSD is named as a direct influence. AllMusic called it one of the greatest psychedelic albums of all-time, and described it as &quot;full of colorful, childlike, distinctly British whimsy, albeit filtered through the perceptive lens of LSD,&quot; adding that &quot;Barrett&#x27;s catchy, melodic acid pop songs are balanced with longer, more experimental pieces showcasing the group&#x27;s instrumental freak-outs.&quot;

James E. Perone says that &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; became known as a concept album in later years, because listeners wanted to play it all the way through rather than pick out a favourite song. While Beatles biographer Philip Norman agrees that &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; is a concept album, other authors contend that Pink Floyd did not start making concept albums until 1973&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. Author George Reisch called Pink Floyd the &quot;undisputed&quot; kings of the concept album, but only starting from &quot;Dark Side&quot;. In July 2006, &quot;Billboard&quot; described &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; as &quot;one of the best psychedelic rock albums ever, driven by Barrett&#x27;s oddball narratives and the band&#x27;s skill with both long jams and perfect pop nuggets&quot;.

=== Reissues ===
&quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; was reissued in the UK in 1979 as a stereo vinyl album, and on CD in the UK and US in 1985. A digitally remastered stereo CD, with new artwork, was released in the US in 1994, and in 1997 limited edition 30th anniversary mono editions were released in the UK, on CD and vinyl. The latter included a selection of art prints, and a six-track bonus CD, &quot;1967: The First Three Singles&quot;.

In 1973, the album, along with &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;, was released as a two-disc set on Capitol/EMI&#x27;s Harvest Records label, titled &quot;A Nice Pair&quot; to introduce fans to the band&#x27;s early work after the success of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. On the US release, the original four-minute studio version of &quot;Astronomy Dominé&quot; was replaced with the eight-minute live version found on &quot;Ummagumma&quot;.

For the 40th anniversary, a two-disc edition was released on 28 August 2007, and a three-disc set was released on 11 September. &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; was remastered and re-released on 26 September 2011. For Record Store Day 2018, &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; was reissued in its mono mix with a bespoke envelope package containing the original cover art.

== Live performances ==
The band promoted the album with a series of concerts. They played dates in Ireland and Scandinavia, and in late October the band was to embark on their first tour of the United States. It was unsuccessful, mainly because of the mental breakdown of Barrett. In his capacity as tour manager, Andrew King travelled to New York to begin preparations, but he ran into serious problems. Visas had not arrived, prompting the cancellation of the first six dates. The band finally flew across the Atlantic on 1 November, but work permits were not yet obtained, so they settled into a hotel in Sausalito, California, just north of San Francisco. After a number of cancellations, the first US performance was given 4 November at Winterland Ballroom, following Janis Joplin fronting Big Brother and the Holding Company.

Communication between record company and band was almost non-existent, and Pink Floyd&#x27;s relationship with Tower and Capitol was therefore poor. Barrett&#x27;s mental condition mirrored the problems that King encountered; when the band performed at Winterland, he detuned his guitar during &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; until the strings fell off. His odd behaviour grew worse in subsequent performances, and during a television recording for &quot;The Pat Boone Show&quot; he confounded the director by lip-syncing &quot;Apples and Oranges&quot; perfectly during the rehearsal, and then standing motionless during the take. King quickly curtailed the band&#x27;s US visit, sending them home on the next flight.

Shortly after their return from the US, beginning 14 November, the band supported Jimi Hendrix on a tour of England, but on one occasion Barrett failed to turn up and they were forced to replace him with singer/guitarist David O&#x27;List borrowed from the opening band the Nice. Barrett&#x27;s depression worsened the longer the tour continued. Longtime Pink Floyd psychedelic lighting designer Peter Wynne-Willson left at the end of the Hendrix tour, though he sympathised with Barrett, whose position as frontman was increasingly insecure. Wynne-Willson, who had worked for a percentage, was replaced by his assistant John Marsh, who collected a lesser wage. Pink Floyd released &quot;Apples and Oranges&quot; (recorded prior to the US tour on 26 and 27 October) but, for the rest of the band, Barrett&#x27;s condition had reached a crisis point, and they responded by adding David Gilmour to their line-up, initially to cover for Syd&#x27;s lapses during live performances.

Some songs on the album were rarely played live. &quot;Flaming&quot; and &quot;Pow R. Toc H.&quot; were performed by Pink Floyd after Barrett&#x27;s departure in 1968. After September 1967, the band played several new compositions in concert. These included &quot;One in a Million&quot;, &quot;Scream Thy Last Scream&quot;, &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot; and &quot;Reaction in G&quot;, the last of which was a song created by the band in response to crowds asking for their hit singles &quot;See Emily Play&quot; and &quot;Arnold Layne&quot;. Barrett resurrected the track &quot;Lucifer Sam&quot; with his short-lived 1972 band Stars. &quot;Astronomy Dominé&quot; was later on the live disc of &quot;Ummagumma&quot; (1969), and adopted by the post-Waters Pink Floyd during the 1994 Division Bell Tour, with a version included on the 1995 live album &quot;Pulse&quot;. David Gilmour, though not a member of Pink Floyd at the time the song was originally recorded, resurrected &quot;Astronomy Dominé&quot; for his &quot;On an Island&quot; and &quot;Rattle That Lock&quot; tours.

<doc id="203503" wikidata="Q200872" url="?curid=203503" title="Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)">
<text>Wish You Were Here is the ninth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 12 September 1975 through Harvest Records in the UK and Columbia Records in the US, their first for the label. Based on material Pink Floyd composed while performing in Europe, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; was recorded over numerous sessions throughout 1975 at EMI Studios in London.

The lyrics express alienation and criticism of the music business. The bulk of the album is taken up by &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;, a nine-part tribute to the Pink Floyd co-founder Syd Barrett, who had left seven years earlier due to his deteriorating mental health. Barrett coincidentally visited during the recording. As with their previous release, &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973), Pink Floyd employed studio effects and synthesisers. Guest singers included Roy Harper, who provided the lead vocals on &quot;Have a Cigar&quot;, and Venetta Fields, who added backing vocals to &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;. To promote the album, Pink Floyd released the double A-side single &quot;Have a Cigar&quot; / &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot;.

&quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; was certified gold in the UK and the US in its year of release and topped the charts in several European countries. By 2004, it had sold an estimated 13 million copies worldwide. It initially received mixed reviews; critics found its music uninspiring and inferior to Pink Floyd&#x27;s previous work. It was later acclaimed as one of the greatest albums of all time, appearing on lists including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums at which it was ranked at #264 in 2023. It was cited by the keyboardist, Richard Wright, and the guitarist, David Gilmour, as their favourite Pink Floyd album.

==Background==
During 1974, Pink Floyd sketched out three new compositions, &quot;Raving and Drooling&quot;, &quot;You Gotta Be Crazy&quot; and &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;. These songs were performed during a series of concerts in France and England, the band&#x27;s first tour since 1973&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. As Pink Floyd had never employed a publicist and kept themselves distant from the press, their relationship with the media began to sour. Mason said later that a critical &quot;NME&quot; review by Syd Barrett devotee Nick Kent may have had an influence in keeping the band together, as they returned to the studio in the first week of 1975.

==Concept==
&quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; is Floyd&#x27;s second album with a conceptual theme, mostly at Roger Waters&#x27; direction. It reflects his feeling that the camaraderie that had served the band was, by then, largely absent. The album begins with a long instrumental preamble and segues into the lyrics for &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;, a tribute to Syd Barrett, whose mental breakdown had forced him to leave the group seven years earlier. Barrett is fondly recalled with lines such as &quot;Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun&quot; and &quot;You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon&quot;.

&quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; is also a critique of the music business. &quot;Shine On&quot; crosses seamlessly into &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot;, a song that begins with an opening door (described by Waters as a symbol of musical discovery and progress betrayed by a music industry more interested in greed and success) and ends with a party, the latter epitomising &quot;the lack of contact and real feelings between people&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Have a Cigar&quot; scorns record industry &quot;fat-cats&quot; with the lyrics repeating a stream of cliches heard by rising newcomers in the industry, and including the question &quot;by the way, which one&#x27;s Pink?&quot; asked of the band on at least one occasion. The lyrics of the next song, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, relate both to Barrett&#x27;s condition and to the dichotomy of Waters&#x27; character, with greed and ambition battling with compassion and idealism.

&quot;I had some criticisms of &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;…&quot; noted David Gilmour. &quot;One or two of the vehicles carrying the ideas were not as strong as the ideas that they carried. I thought we should try and work harder on marrying the idea and the vehicle that carried it, so that they both had an equal magic… It&#x27;s something I was personally pushing when we made &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;.&quot;

==Recording==
Alan Parsons, EMI staff engineer for Pink Floyd&#x27;s previous studio album, &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, declined to continue working with them due to him starting his own group and working on their first album. The group had worked with engineer Brian Humphries on &quot;More&quot;, recorded at Pye Studios, and again in 1974 when he replaced an inexperienced concert engineer. Humphries was therefore the natural choice to work on the band&#x27;s new material, although, being a stranger to EMI&#x27;s Abbey Road set-up, he encountered some early difficulties. On one occasion, Humphries inadvertently spoiled the backing tracks for &quot;Shine On&quot;, a piece that Waters and drummer Nick Mason had spent many hours perfecting, with echo. The entire piece had to be re-recorded.

The sessions for &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; at EMI&#x27;s Studio Three (now Abbey Road Studios) lasted from January until July 1975, recording on four days each week from 2:30 pm until very late in the evening. The group found it difficult at first to devise any new material, especially as the success of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; had left all four physically and emotionally drained. Keyboardist Richard Wright later described these sessions as &quot;falling within a difficult period&quot;, and Waters recalled them as &quot;torturous&quot;. Mason found the process of multi-track recording drawn-out and tedious, while Gilmour was more interested in improving the band&#x27;s existing material. Gilmour was also becoming increasingly frustrated with Mason, whose failing marriage had brought on a general malaise and sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming.

Humphries gave his point of view regarding these struggled sessions in a 2014 interview: “There were days when we didn&#x27;t do anything. I don&#x27;t think they knew what they wanted to do. We had a dartboard and an air rifle and we&#x27;d play these word games, sit around, get drunk, go home and return the next day. That’s all we were doing until suddenly everything started falling into place.”

After several weeks, Waters began to visualise another concept. The three new compositions from the 1974 tours were at least a starting point for a new album, and &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; seemed a reasonable choice as a centrepiece for the new work. Mostly an instrumental 20-minute-plus piece similar to &quot;Echoes&quot;, the opening four-note guitar phrase reminded Waters of the lingering ghost of former band-member Syd Barrett. Gilmour had composed the phrase entirely by accident, but was encouraged by Waters&#x27; positive response. Waters wanted to split &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;, and sandwich two new songs between its two halves. Gilmour disagreed, but was outvoted three to one. &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot; and &quot;Have a Cigar&quot; were attacks on the music business, their lyrics working with &quot;Shine On&quot; to provide a summary of the rise and fall of Barrett; &quot;Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... that sort of indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd.&quot; &quot;Raving and Drooling&quot; and &quot;You’ve Got To Be Crazy&quot; had no place in the new concept, and were set aside until the following album, 1977&#x27;s &quot;Animals&quot;.

===Syd Barrett&#x27;s visit===

On 5 June 1975, on the eve of the second North American leg of their Wish You Were Here Tour, Gilmour married his first wife, Ginger. That day, the band were completing the mix of &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; when an overweight man with shaven head and eyebrows entered, carrying a plastic bag. Waters did not recognise him. Gilmour presumed he was an EMI staff member. Wright presumed he was a friend of Waters, but realised it was Barrett. Mason also failed to recognise him and was &quot;horrified&quot; when Gilmour identified him. In Mason&#x27;s Pink Floyd memoir &quot;Inside Out&quot;, he recalled Barrett&#x27;s conversation as &quot;desultory and not entirely sensible&quot;. Cover artist Storm Thorgerson reflected on Barrett&#x27;s presence: &quot;Two or three people cried. He sat round and talked for a bit but he wasn&#x27;t really there.&quot; According to Gilmour, Barrett &quot;came two or three days and then he didn&#x27;t come any more.&quot;

Waters was reportedly reduced to tears by the sight of his former bandmate. When fellow visitor Andrew King asked how Barrett had gained so much weight, Barrett said he had a large refrigerator in his kitchen and had been eating lots of pork chops. He mentioned that he was ready to help with the recording, but while listening to the mix of &quot;Shine On&quot;, showed no signs of understanding its relevance to him. Barrett joined Gilmour&#x27;s wedding reception in the EMI canteen, but left without saying goodbye. Apart from Waters seeing Barrett buying sweets in Harrods a couple of years later, it was the last time any member of the band saw him alive. Barrett&#x27;s appearance may have influenced the final version of &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;; a subtle refrain performed by Wright from &quot;See Emily Play&quot; is audible towards the end. Waters said later: &quot;&#x27;Shine On&#x27; is not really about Sydhe&#x27;s just a symbol for all the extremes of absence some people have to indulge in because it&#x27;s the only way they can cope with how fucking sad it is, modern life, to withdraw completely. I found that terribly sad.&quot;

===Instrumentation===
As with &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, the band used synthesizers such as the EMS VCS 3 (on &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot;), but softened with Gilmour&#x27;s acoustic guitar, and percussion from Mason. The beginning of &quot;Shine On&quot; contains remnants from a previous but incomplete studio recording by the band known as &quot;Household Objects&quot;. Wine glasses had been filled with varying amounts of fluid, and recordings were made of a wet finger circling the edge of each glass. These recordings were multi-tracked into chords.

Jazz violinist Stéphane Grappelli and classical violinist Yehudi Menuhin were performing in another studio in the building, and were invited to record a piece for the new album. Menuhin watched as Grappelli played on the song &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;; however, the band later decided his contribution was unsuitable and Mason has erroneously stated that the piece was wiped. In actuality Grappelli&#x27;s playing was included on the album, but so low in the final mix that the band presumed it would be insulting to credit him. He was paid £300 for his contribution (equivalent to £ in 2025). Saxophonist Dick Parry, who had performed on &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, performed on &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;. The opening bars of &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; were recorded from Gilmour&#x27;s car radio, with somebody turning the dial (the classical music heard is the finale of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Fourth Symphony).

===Vocals===
Recording sessions had twice been interrupted by US tours (one in April and the other in June 1975), and the final sessions, which occurred after the band&#x27;s performance at Knebworth, proved particularly troublesome for Waters. He struggled to record the vocals for &quot;Have a Cigar&quot;, requiring several takes to perform an acceptable version. His problems stemmed in part from the stresses placed upon his voice while recording the lead vocals of &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;. Gilmour was asked to sing in his place, but declined, and eventually colleague and friend Roy Harper was asked to stand in. Harper was recording his own album in another of EMI&#x27;s studios, and Gilmour had already performed some guitar licks for him. Waters later regretted the decision, believing he should have performed the song. The Blackberries recorded backing vocals for &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;.

=== Touring ===
The band played much of &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; on 5 July 1975 at the Knebworth music festival. Roy Harper, performing at the same event, on discovering that his stage costume was missing, proceeded to destroy one of Pink Floyd&#x27;s vans, injuring himself in the process. This delayed the normal setup procedure of the band&#x27;s sound system. As a pair of World War II Spitfire aircraft had been booked to fly over the crowd during their entrance, the band were not able to delay their set. The result was that a power supply problem pushed Wright&#x27;s keyboards completely out of tune, damaging the band&#x27;s performance. At one point he left the stage, but the band were able to continue with a less sensitive keyboard, a piano and a simpler light show. Following a brief intermission, they returned to perform &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, but critics displeased about being denied access backstage savaged the performance.

==Packaging and album cover art==


&quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; was sold in one of the more elaborate packages to accompany a Pink Floyd album. Storm Thorgerson had accompanied the band on their 1974 tour and had given serious thought to the meaning of the lyrics, eventually deciding that the songs were, in general, concerned with &quot;unfulfilled presence&quot;, rather than Barrett&#x27;s illness. This theme of absence was reflected in the ideas produced by his long hours spent brainstorming with the band. Thorgerson had noted that Roxy Music&#x27;s &quot;Country Life&quot; was sold in an opaque green cellophane sleeve – censoring the cover image – and he copied the idea, concealing the artwork for &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; in a black-coloured shrink-wrap (therefore making the album art &quot;absent&quot;). The concept behind &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot; and &quot;Have a Cigar&quot; suggested the use of a handshake (an often empty gesture), and George Hardie designed a sticker containing the album&#x27;s logo of two mechanical hands engaged in a handshake, to be placed on the opaque sleeve (the mechanical handshake logo would also appear on the labels of the vinyl album this time in a black and blue background).

The album&#x27;s cover images were photographed by Aubrey &quot;Po&quot; Powell, Thorgerson&#x27;s partner at the design studio Hipgnosis, and inspired by the idea that people tend to conceal their true feelings, for fear of &quot;getting burned&quot;, and thus two businessmen were pictured shaking hands, one man on fire. &quot;Getting burned&quot; was also a common phrase in the music industry, used often by artists denied royalty payments. Two stuntmen were used (Ronnie Rondell and Danny Rogers), one dressed in a fireproof suit covered by a business suit. His head was protected by a hood, underneath a wig. The photograph was taken at Warner Bros. Studios in California, known at the time as The Burbank Studios. Initially the wind was blowing in the wrong direction, and the flames were forced into Rondell&#x27;s face, burning his moustache. The two stuntmen changed positions, and the image was later reversed. The versions released on Harvest label (in Europe) and on Columbia label (among others, United States, Canada and Australia) use similar, but different photos from the photo session.

The album&#x27;s back cover depicts a faceless &quot;Floyd salesman&quot;, in Thorgerson&#x27;s words, &quot;selling his soul&quot; in the desert (shot in the Yuma Desert in California again by Powell). The absence of wrists and ankles signifies his presence as an &quot;empty suit&quot;. The inner sleeve shows a veil concealing a nude woman in a windswept Norfolk grove, and a splash-less diver at Mono Lake – titled &quot;Monosee&quot; (the German translation of Mono Lake) in the liner notes – in California (again emphasising the theme of absence). Various releases of the album on Vinyl included a postcard with this image. The decision to shroud the cover in black plastic was not popular with the band&#x27;s US record company, Columbia Records, which insisted that it be changed but was over-ruled. EMI was less concerned; the band were reportedly extremely happy with the end product, and when presented with a pre-production mockup, they accepted it with a spontaneous round of applause.

==Release==

The album was released on 12 September 1975 in the UK, and on the following day in the US. It was Pink Floyd&#x27;s first album with Columbia Records, an affiliate of CBS; the band and their manager Steve O&#x27;Rourke had been dissatisfied with the efforts of EMI&#x27;s US label Capitol Records. The band remained with EMI&#x27;s Harvest Records in Europe.

In Britain, with 250,000 advance sales, the album debuted at number three and reached number one the following week. Demand was such that EMI informed retailers that only half of their orders would be fulfilled. With 900,000 advance orders (the largest for any Columbia release) it reached number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; chart in its second week. &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; was Pink Floyd&#x27;s fastest-selling album ever. The album was certified silver and gold (60,000 and 100,000 sales respectively) in the UK on 1 August 1975, and Gold in the US on 17 September 1975. It was certified six-times platinum in the US on 16 May 1997, and by 2004 had sold an estimated 13 million copies worldwide. &quot;Have a Cigar&quot; was chosen by Columbia as the first single, with &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot; on the B-side in the US. It topped Dutch, English and Spanish charts; in Spain, it remained at number one for 20 weeks.

== Reception ==

On release, the album received mixed reviews. Ben Edmunds wrote in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that the band&#x27;s &quot;lackadaisical demeanor&quot; leaves the subject of Barrett &quot;unrealised; they give such a matter-of-fact reading of the goddamn thing that they might as well be singing about Roger Waters&#x27;s brother-in-law getting a parking ticket&quot;. Edmunds concluded the band is &quot;devoid&quot; of the &quot;sincere passion for their &#x27;art that contemporary space rock acts purportedly have. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; reviewer wrote: &quot;From whichever direction one approaches &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, it still sounds unconvincing in its ponderous sincerity and displays a critical lack of imagination in all departments.&quot; 

In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;The music is not only simple and attractive, with the synthesizer used mostly for texture and the guitar breaks for comment, but it actually achieves some of the symphonic dignity (and cross-referencing) that &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; simulated so ponderously.&quot; Years later, he wrote that &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; was his favourite Pink Floyd: &quot;It has soul [...] It&#x27;s Roger Waters&#x27;s lament for Syd, not my idea of a tragic hero but as long as he&#x27;s Roger&#x27;s that doesn&#x27;t matter.&quot; 

Paul Stump, in his 1997 &quot;History of Progressive Rock&quot;, argued that critical disappointment with &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; was likely inevitable due to the monumental expectations of what &quot;was (at the time) the most eagerly anticipated rock album ever released. Even the announcement of its issue date was headline news. These hosannas were grounded on no more than the fact that it was simply the Floyd&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;[The] Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, which represented, for many, the acme of the genre to date.&quot; He was critical of the dominance of synthesiser textures, saying it often made &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; sound like a showcase for Wright&#x27;s new equipment.

&quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; has been frequently named one of the greatest albums and one of the greatest progressive rock albums. In 2003, it was ranked at number 209 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, ranked at number 211 in a 2012 revised list, and ranked at number 264 in a 2023 revised list. In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it the fourth-greatest progressive rock album. In 2014, &quot;Prog&quot; readers voted it the seventh-greatest progressive rock album. In 1998, &quot;Q&quot; readers voted &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; the 34th-greatest album. In 2000, &quot;Q&quot; placed it at number 43 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2000, it was voted number 38 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2007, one of Germany&#x27;s largest public radio stations, WDR 2, asked its listeners to vote for the 200 best albums of all time. &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; was voted number one. In 2004, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; was ranked number 36 on the &quot;Pitchfork&quot; list of the Top 100 albums of the 1970s. &quot;IGN&quot; rated &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; as the eighth-greatest classic rock album, and &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; placed &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; as the second-best Pink Floyd album.

Wright and Gilmour cited &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; as their favourite Pink Floyd album. Wright said: &quot;It&#x27;s an album I can listen to for pleasure, and there aren&#x27;t many Floyd albums that I can.&quot; Gilmour said: &quot;The end result of all that, whatever it was, definitely has left me an album I can live with very very happily. I like it very much.&quot; Waters said &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; were the &quot;most complete&quot; Pink Floyd albums, and that &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and their next album, &quot;Animals&quot; (1977), &quot;signalled the end of the band as it had been before&quot;.

==Reissues and remastering==
&quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; has been remastered and re-released on several formats. In the UK and US the album was re-issued in quadraphonic using the SQ format in 1976, and in 1980 a special &quot;Hi-Fi Today&quot; audiophile print was released in the UK. It was released on CD in Japan in October 1982, in the US in 1983, and in the UK in 1985, and again as a remastered CD with new artwork in 1994. In the US, Columbia&#x27;s CBS Mastersound label released a half-speed mastered audiophile LP in 1981, and in 1994 Sony Mastersound released a 24-carat gold-plated CD, remastered using Super Bit Mapping, with the original artwork from the LP in both longbox and jewel case forms, the latter with a cardboard slipcover. The album was included as part of the box set &quot;Shine On&quot;, and three years later Columbia Records released an updated remastered CD, 17 seconds longer than the EMI remasters from 1994, giving a running time of 44:28.

The label was a recreation of the original machine handshake logo, with a black and blue background. The album was subsequently re-released in 2000 for its 25th anniversary, on the Capitol Records label in the US. The album was re-released and remixed in 2011. The &quot;Wish You Were Here – Immersion Box Set&quot; includes the new stereo digital remaster (2011) by James Guthrie on CD, an unreleased 5.1 Surround Mix (2009) by James Guthrie on DVD and Blu-ray, a Quad Mix (which had been released only on vinyl LP and 8-track tape) on DVD, as well as the original stereo mix (1975) on DVD and Blu-ray. This campaign also featured the 2011 stereo remaster on 180g heavyweight vinyl, as well as the 2011 stereo remaster and the 5.1 surround sound mix (2009) as a hybrid Super Audio CD (SACD). In 2016, the 180g vinyl was re-released on the band&#x27;s own Pink Floyd Records label (with distribution by Warner Music and Sony Music) this time remastered by James Guthrie, Joel Plante and Bernie Grundman.

<text>Sajida Khairallah Talfah (; born 1935) is the widow of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and mother of two sons (Uday and Qusay) and three daughters (Raghad, Rana, and Hala) with him. She is the oldest daughter of Khairallah Talfah, her husband&#x27;s maternal uncle.

==Wife of Saddam Hussein==
Sajida and Saddam had five children together. Their marriage was arranged when they were children. She was said to have been 2 years older than him. They met when Saddam was about 21 years old.

In 1964, their first son Uday was born, followed by Qusay in 1966. Their first daughter Raghad was born in 1968. Followed by a second daughter, Rana in 1969, and finally their youngest daughter Hala was born in 1972.

In 1986, Saddam married another woman, Samira Shahbandar, while still married to Sajida. Sajida was enraged, and Uday was also angry over his father&#x27;s new wife. Uday took it as an insult to his mother and also believed that his inheritance was endangered by Saddam taking a new wife. In October 1988, at a party thrown in the honor of Suzanne Mubarak, the wife of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Uday beat and stabbed Kamel Hana Gegeo to death. Uday believed that it was Kamel who had introduced Saddam and Samira, and that he had arranged their meetings. Although her husband married another woman, Sajida and Saddam never divorced. 

Sajida hardly ever appeared in public with her husband, so for many years her existence was little known to the Iraqi people. However, when rumors surfaced that Saddam had married another woman, and that his family life was now strained, more pictures and videos appeared in the Iraqi media of Saddam and Sajida, as well as them with their children. These pictures and videos were intended to make it seem as if Saddam&#x27;s family life was not strained. 

Sajida, along with many members of her family, fled Iraq in 1990 because of the Persian Gulf War, leaving Iraq before the bombings began. There are many different reports on where the Hussein family settled, but a possible location is Mauritania. The Hussein family returned to Iraq after the war was over. 

==In popular culture==
She was played by Shohreh Aghdashloo in the BBC adaptation &quot;House of Saddam&quot; in 2008, in which her character played a major role.

<text>Pictorialism is an international style and aesthetic movement that dominated photography during the later 19th and early 20th centuries. There is no standard definition of the term, but in general it refers to a style in which the photographer has somehow manipulated what would otherwise be a straightforward photograph as a means of creating an image rather than simply recording it. Typically, a pictorial photograph appears to lack a sharp focus (some more so than others), is printed in one or more colors other than black-and-white (ranging from warm brown to deep blue) and may have visible brush strokes or other manipulation of the surface. For the pictorialist, a photograph, like a painting, drawing or engraving, was a way of projecting an emotional intent into the viewer&#x27;s realm of imagination.

Pictorialism as a movement thrived from about 1885 to 1915, although it was still being promoted by some as late as the 1940s. It began in response to claims that a photograph was nothing more than a simple record of reality, and transformed into a movement to advance the status of all photography as a true art form. For more than three decades painters, photographers and art critics debated opposing artistic philosophies, ultimately culminating in the acquisition of photographs by several major art museums.

Pictorialism gradually declined in popularity after 1920, although it did not fade out of popularity until the end of World War II. During this period the new style of photographic Modernism came into vogue, and the public&#x27;s interest shifted to more sharply focused images such as seen in the work of Ansel Adams. Several important 20th-century photographers began their careers in a pictorialist style but transitioned into sharply focused photography by the 1930s.

==Overview==
Photography as a technical process involving the development of film and prints in a darkroom originated in the early 19th century, with the forerunners of traditional photographic prints coming into prominence around 1838 to 1840. Not long after the new medium was established, photographers, painters and others began to argue about the relationship between the scientific and artistic aspects of the medium. As early as 1853, English painter William John Newton proposed that the camera could produce artistic results if the photographer would keep an image slightly out of focus. Others vehemently believed that a photograph was equivalent to the visual record of a chemistry experiment. Photography historian Naomi Rosenblum points out that &quot;the dual character of the medium—its capacity to produce both art and document—[was] demonstrated soon after its discovery ... Nevertheless, a good part of the nineteenth century was spent debating which of these directions was the medium&#x27;s true function.&quot;

These debates reached their peak during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, culminating in the creation of a movement that is usually characterized as a particular style of photography: pictorialism. This style is defined first by a distinctly personal expression that emphasizes photography&#x27;s ability to create visual beauty rather than simply record facts. However, recently historians have recognized that pictorialism is more than just a visual style. It evolved in direct context with the changing social and cultural attitudes of the time, and, as such, it should not be characterized simply as a visual trend. One writer has noted that pictorialism was &quot;simultaneously a movement, a philosophy, an aesthetic and a style.&quot;

Contrary to what some histories of photography portray, pictorialism did not come about as the result of a linear evolution of artistic sensibilities; rather, it was formed through &quot;an intricate, divergent, often passionately conflicting barrage of strategies.&quot; While photographers and others debated whether photography could be art, the advent of photography directly affected the roles and livelihoods of many traditional artists. Prior to the development of photography, a painted miniature portrait was the most common means of recording a person&#x27;s likeness. Thousands of painters were engaged in this art form. But photography quickly negated the need for and interest in miniature portraits. One example of this effect was seen at the annual exhibition of the Royal Academy in London; in 1830 more than 300 miniature paintings were exhibited, but by 1870 only 33 were on display. Photography had taken over for one type of art form, but the question of whether photography itself could be artistic had not been resolved.

Some painters soon adopted photography as a tool to help them record a model&#x27;s pose, a landscape scene or other elements to include in their art. It is known that many of the great 19th-century painters, including Delacroix, Courbet, Manet, Degas, Cézanne, and Gauguin, took photographs themselves, used photographs by others and incorporated images from photographs into their work. While heated debates about the relationship between photography and art continued in print and in lecture halls, the distinction between a photographic image and a painting became more and more difficult to discern. As photography continued to develop, the interactions between painting and photography became increasingly reciprocal. More than a few pictorial photographers, including Alvin Langdon Coburn, Edward Steichen, Gertrude Käsebier, Oscar Gustave Rejlander, and Sarah Choate Sears, were originally trained as painters or took up painting in addition to their photographic skills.

It was during this same period that cultures and societies around the world were being affected by a rapid increase in intercontinental travel and commerce. Books and magazines published on one continent could be exported and sold on another with increasing ease, and the development of reliable mail services facilitated individual exchanges of ideas, techniques and, most importantly for photography, actual prints. These developments led to pictorialism being &quot;a more international movement in photography than almost any other photographic genre.&quot; Camera clubs in the U.S., England, France, Germany, Austria, Japan and other countries regularly lent works to each other&#x27;s exhibitions, exchanged technical information and published essays and critical commentaries in one another&#x27;s journals. Led by The Linked Ring in England, the Photo-Secession in the U.S., and the Photo-club de Paris in France, first hundreds and then thousands of photographers passionately pursued common interests in this multi-dimensional movement. Within the span of little more than a decade, notable pictorial photographers were found in Western and Eastern Europe, North America, Asia and Australia.

==The impact of Kodak cameras==
For the first forty years after a practical process of capturing and reproducing images was invented, photography remained the domain of a highly dedicated group of individuals who had expert knowledge of and skills in science, mechanics and art. To make a photograph, a person had to learn a great deal about chemistry, optics, light, the mechanics of cameras and how these factors combine to properly render a scene. It was not something that one learned easily or engaged in lightly, and, as such, it was limited to a relatively small group of academics, scientists and professional photographers.
All of that changed in a few years&#x27; time span. In 1888 George Eastman introduced the first handheld amateur camera, the Kodak camera. It was marketed with the slogan &quot;You press the button, we do the rest.&quot; The camera was pre-loaded with a roll of film that produced about 100 2.5&quot; round picture exposures, and it could easily be carried and handheld during its operation. After all of the shots on the film were exposed, the whole camera was returned to the Kodak company in Rochester, New York, where the film was developed, prints were made, and new photographic film was placed inside. Then the camera and prints were returned to the customer, who was ready to take more pictures.

The impact of this change was enormous. Suddenly almost anyone could take a photograph, and within the span of a few years photography became one of the biggest fads in the world. Photography collector Michael G. Wilson observed &quot;Thousands of commercial photographers and a hundred times as many amateurs were producing millions of photographs annually ... The decline in the quality of professional work and the deluge of snapshots (a term borrowed from hunting, meaning to get off a quick shot without taking the time to aim) resulted in a world awash with technically good but aesthetically indifferent photographs.&quot;

Concurrent with this change was the development of national and international commercial enterprises to meet the new demand for cameras, films and prints. At the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago, which attracted more than 27 million people, photography for amateurs was marketed at an unprecedented scale. There were multiple large exhibits displaying photographs from around the world, many camera and darkroom equipment manufacturers showing and selling their latest goods, dozens of portrait studios and even on-the-spot documentation of the Exposition itself. Suddenly photography and photographers were household commodities.

Many serious photographers were appalled. Their craft, and to some their art, was being co-opted by a newly engaged, uncontrolled and mostly untalented citizenry. The debate about art and photography intensified around the argument that if anyone could take a photograph then photography could not possibly be called art. Some of the most passionate defenders of photography as art pointed out that photography should not and cannot be seen as an &quot;either/or&quot; medium—some photographs are indeed simple records of reality, but with the right elements some are indeed works of art. William Howe Downs, art critic for the &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot;, summed up this position in 1900 by saying &quot;Art is not so much a matter of methods and processes as it is an affair of temperament, of taste and of sentiment ... In the hands of the artist, the photograph becomes a work of art ... In a word, photography is what the photographer makes it ‒ an art or a trade.&quot;

All of these elements—the debates over photography and art, the impacts of Kodak cameras, and the changing social and cultural values of the times—combined to set the stage for an evolution in how art and photography, independently and together, would appear at the turn of the century. The course that drove pictorialism was set almost as soon as photographic processes were established, but it was not until the last decade of the 19th century that an international pictorialist movement came together.

==Defining pictorialism==
In 1869 English photographer Henry Peach Robinson published a book entitled &quot;Pictorial Effect in Photography: Being Hints on Composition and Chiaroscuro for Photographers.&quot; This is the first common use of the term &quot;pictorial&quot; referring to photography in the context of a certain stylistic element, chiaroscuro ‒ an Italian term used by painters and art historians that refers to the use of dramatic lighting and shading to convey an expressive mood. In his book Robinson promoted what he called &quot;combination printing&quot;, a method he had devised nearly 20 years earlier by combining individual elements from separate images into a new single image by manipulating multiple negatives or prints. Robinson thus considered that he had created &quot;art&quot; through photography, since it was only through his direct intervention that the final image came about. Robinson continued to expand on the meaning of the term throughout his life.

Other photographers and art critics, including Oscar Rejlander, Marcus Aurelius Root, and John Ruskin, echoed these ideas. One of the primary forces behind the rise of pictorialism was the belief that straight photography was purely representational ‒ that it showed reality without the filter of artistic interpretation. It was, for all intents and purposes, a simple record of the visual facts, lacking artistic intent or merit. Robinson and others felt strongly that the &quot;usually accepted limitations of photography had to be overcome if an equality of status was to be achieved.&quot;

Robert Demachy later summarized this concept in an article entitled &quot;What Difference Is There Between a Good Photograph and an Artistic Photograph?&quot;. He wrote &quot;We must realize that, on undertaking pictorial photography, we have, unwittingly perhaps, bound ourselves to the strict observance of rules hundreds of years more ancient than the oldest formulae of our chemical craft. We have slipped into the Temple of Art by a back door, and found ourselves amongst the crowd of adepts.&quot;

One of the challenges in promoting photography as art was that there were many different opinions about how art should look. After the Third Philadelphia Salon 1900, which showcased dozens of pictorial photographers, one critic wondered &quot;whether the idea of art in anything like the true sense had ever been heard or thought by the great majority of exhibitors.&quot;

While some photographers saw themselves becoming true artists by emulating painting, at least one school of painting directly inspired photographers. During the 1880s, when debates over art and photography were becoming commonplace, a style of painting known as Tonalism first appeared. Within a few years it became a significant artistic influence on the development of pictorialism. Painters such as James McNeill Whistler, George Inness, Ralph Albert Blakelock, and Arnold Böcklin saw the interpretation of the experience of nature, as contrasted with simply recording an image of nature, as the artist&#x27;s highest duty. To these artists it was essential that their paintings convey an emotional response to the viewer, which was elicited through an emphasis on the atmospheric elements in the picture and by the use of &quot;vague shapes and subdued tonalities ... [to convey] a sense of elegiac melancholy.&quot;

Applying this same sensibility to photography, Alfred Stieglitz later stated it this way: &quot;Atmosphere is the medium through which we see all things. In order, therefore, to see them in their true value on a photograph, as we do in Nature, atmosphere must be there. Atmosphere softens all lines; it graduates the transition from light to shade; it is essential to the reproduction of the sense of distance. That dimness of outline which is characteristic for distant objects is due to atmosphere. Now, what atmosphere is to Nature, tone is to a picture.&quot;

Paul Lewis Anderson, a prolific contemporary promoter of pictorialism, advised his readers that true art photography conveyed &quot;suggestion and mystery&quot;, in which &quot;mystery consists in affording an opportunity for the exercise of the imagination, whereas suggestion involves stimulating the imagination by direct or indirect means.&quot; Science, pictorialists contended, might answer a demand for truthful information, but art must respond to the human need for stimulation of the senses. This could only be done by creating a mark of individuality for each image and, ideally, each print.

For pictorialists, true individuality was expressed through the creation of a unique print, considered by many to be the epitome of artistic photography. By manipulating the appearance of images through what some called &quot;ennobling processes&quot;, such as gum or bromoil printing, pictorialists were able to create unique photographs that were sometimes mistaken for drawings or lithographs.

Many of the strongest voices that championed pictorialism at its beginning were a new generation of amateur photographers. In contrast to its meaning today, the word &quot;amateur&quot; held a different connotation in the discussions of that time. Rather than suggesting an inexperienced novice, the word characterized someone who strived for artistic excellence and a freedom from rigid academic influence. An amateur was seen as someone who could break the rules because he or she was not bound by the then rigid rules set forth by long-established photography organizations like the Royal Photographic Society. An article in the British journal &quot;Amateur Photographer&quot; stated &quot;photography is an art ‒ perhaps the only one in which the amateur soon equals, and frequently excels, the professional in proficiency.&quot; This attitude prevailed in many countries around the world. At the 1893 Hamburg International Photographic Exhibition in Germany, only the work of amateurs was allowed. Alfred Lichtwark, then director of the Kunsthalle Hamburg believed &quot;the only good portraiture in any medium was being done by amateurs photographers, who had the economic freedom and time to experiment.&quot;

In 1948, S.D.Jouhar defined a Pictorial photograph as &quot;mainly an aesthetic symbolic record of a scene &quot;plus&quot; the artist&#x27;s personal comment and interpretation, capable of transmitting an emotional response to the mind of a receptive spectator. It should show originality, imagination, unity of purpose, a quality of repose, and have an infinite quality about it.&quot;

==Transition into Modernism==
The evolution of pictorialism from the 19th century well into the 1940s was both slow and determined. From its roots in Europe it spread to the U.S. and the rest of the world in several semi-distinct stages. Prior to 1890 pictorialism emerged through advocates who were mainly in England, Germany, Austria and France. During the 1890s the center shifted to New York and Stieglitz&#x27;s multi-faceted efforts. By 1900 pictorialism had reached countries around the world, and major exhibitions of pictorial photography were held in dozens of cities.

A culminating moment for pictorialism and for photography in general occurred in 1910, when the Albright Gallery in Buffalo bought 15 photographs from Stieglitz&#x27; 291 Gallery. This was the first time photography was officially recognized as an art form worthy of a museum collection, and it signaled a definite shift in many photographers&#x27; thinking. Stieglitz, who had worked so long for this moment, responded by indicating he was already thinking of a new vision beyond pictorialism. He wrote, It is high time that the stupidity and sham in pictorial photography be struck a solarplexus blow ... Claims of art won&#x27;t do. Let the photographer make a perfect photograph. And if he happens to be a lover of perfection and a seer, the resulting photograph will be straight and beautiful – a true photograph.

Soon after Stieglitz began to direct his attention more to modern painting and sculpture, and Clarence H. White and others took over the leadership of a new generation of photographers. As the harsh realities of World War I affected people around the world, the public&#x27;s taste for the art of the past began to change. Developed countries of the world focused more and more on industry and growth, and art reflected this change by featuring hard-edged images of new buildings, airplanes and industrial landscapes.

, a 20th-century photographer who continued to make pictorial photographs well into the 1960s, believed that pictorialism is eternal because it is based upon beauty first. He wrote &quot;There is no solution in trying to eradicate pictorialism for one would then have to destroy idealism, sentiment and all sense of art and beauty. There will always be pictorialism.&quot;

==Pictorialism by country==
===Australia===
One of the primary catalysts of pictorialism in Australia was (1864–1942), who studied photographic chemistry and printing in London, Zurich and Vienna between 1889 and 1897. When he returned to his home country in 1897, he greatly influenced his colleagues by exhibiting what one newspaper called photographs that could be &quot;mistaken for works of art.&quot; Over the next decade a core of photographer artists, including Harold Cazneaux, Frank Hurley, Cecil Bostock, Henri Mallard, Rose Simmonds, and Olive Cotton, exhibited pictorial works at salons and exhibitions across the country and published their photos in the &quot;Australian Photographic Journal&quot; and the &quot;Australasian Photo-Review&quot;.

===Austria===
In 1891 the Club der Amateur Photographen in Wien (Vienna Amateur Photographers&#x27; Club) held the first International Exhibition of Photography in Vienna. The Club, founded by Carl Sma, Federico Mallmann and , was founded to foster relationships with photographic groups in other countries. After Alfred Buschbeck became head of the club in 1893, it simplified its name to Wiener Camera-Klub (Vienna Camera Club) and began publishing a lavish magazine called &quot;Wiener Photographische Blätter&quot; that continued until 1898. It regularly featured articles from influential foreign photographers such as Alfred Stieglitz and Robert Demachy.

As in other countries, opposing viewpoints engaged a wider range of photographers in defining what pictorialism meant. Hans Watzek, Hugo Henneberg and Heinrich Kühn formed an organization called Das Kleeblatt (The Trilfolium) expressly to increase the exchange of information with other organizations in other countries, especially, France, Germany and the United States. Initially a small, informal group, Das Kleeblatt increased it influence in the Wiener Camera-Klub through its international connections, and several other organizations promoting pictorialism were created in other cities throughout the region. As in other countries, interest in pictorialism faded after World War I, and eventually most of the Austrian organization slipped into obscurity during the 1920s.

===Canada===
Pictorialism was the first distinct photographic movement in Canada. (1880–1956) was one of its first practitioners, and he was also the first Canadian to be elected to Stieglitz&#x27;s Photo-Secession group in New York. This inspired Carter to bring an exhibition of pictorial photography to Toronto in 1906, with the help of Harold Mortimer-Lamb (1872–1970) and fellow Secessionist Percy Hodgins. In 1907, Carter organized Canada&#x27;s first major exhibition of pictorial photography at Montreal&#x27;s Art Association. Carter and fellow photographer Arthur Goss attempted to introduce pictorialist principles to the members of the Toronto Camera Club, although their efforts were met with some resistance. Minna Keene (1861-1943) was a celebrated Pictorialist who had already established her presence in the movement by the time she moved from the U.K. to Canada in 1913. In the late 1910s and early 1920s, Margaret Watkins (1884-1969) produced still-life photographs that have become some of the most internationally recognized modernist images. Pictorialism in Canada continued well into the 20th century. For example, H.G. Cox (1885-1972), a B.C. photographer, didn&#x27;t begin his Pictorialist practice until the 1920s. Similarly, Vancouver photographer John Vanderpant (1884-1939) had already begun a practice of modernist photography, yet still integrated Pictorialism into his photographs.

===England===

As early as 1853 amateur photographer William J. Newton proposed the idea that &quot;a &#x27;natural object&#x27;, such as a tree, should be photographed in accordance &#x27;the acknowledged principles of fine art&#x27;&quot;. From there other early photographers, including Henry Peach Robinson and Peter Henry Emerson, continued to promote the concept of photography as art. In 1892 Robinson, along with George Davison and , established the first organization devoted specifically to the ideal of photography as art ‒ The Linked Ring. They invited like-minded photographers, including Frank Sutcliffe, Frederick H. Evans, Alvin Langdon Coburn, Frederick Hollyer, James Craig Annan, Alfred Horsley Hinton and others, to join them. Soon The Linked Ring was at the forefront of the movement to have photography regarded as an art form.

After The Linked Ring invited a select group of Americans as members, debates broke out about the goals and purpose of the club. When more American than British members were shown at their annual exhibit in 1908, a motion was introduced to disband the organization. By 1910 The Linked Ring has dissolved, and its members went their own way.

===France===
Pictorialism in France is dominated by two names, Constant Puyo and Robert Demachy. They were the most famous members of the Photo-Club de Paris, a separate organization from the Société française de photographie. They are particularly well known for their use of pigment processes, especially gum bichromate. In 1906, they published a book on the subject, &quot;Les Procédés d&#x27;art en Photographie&quot;. Both of them also wrote many articles for the &quot;Bulletin du Photo-Club de Paris&quot; (1891–1902) and &quot;La Revue de Photographie&quot; (1903–1908), a magazine which quickly became the most influential French publication dealing with artistic photography during the early 20th century. Céline Laguarde was the leading woman photographer in the field and her work was published alongside Puyo and Demachy.

===Germany===
The , Theodor and Oskar, of Hamburg were among the first to advocate for photography as art in their country. At meetings of the Society for the Promotion of Amateur Photography (Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Amateur-Photographie), other photographers, including Heinrich Beck, , and , advanced the cause of pictorialism. The Homeisters, along with Heinrich Kühn, later formed The Presidium (Das Praesidium), whose members were instrumental in major exhibitions at the Kunsthalle in Hamburg. Nowadays Karl Maria Udo Remmes represents the style of pictorialism in the field of theatrical backstage photography.

===Japan===
In 1889 photographers Ogawa Kazumasa, W. K. Burton, Kajima Seibei and several others formed the Nihon Shashin-kai (Japan Photographic Society) in order to promote &quot;geijutsu shashin&quot; (art photography) in that country. Acceptance of this new style was slow at first, but in 1893 Burton coordinated a major invitational exhibition known as &quot;Gaikoku Shashin-ga Tenrain-kai&quot; or the &quot;Foreign Photographic Art Exhibition&quot;. The 296 works that were shown came from members of the London Camera Club, including important photographs by Peter Henry Emerson and George Davison. The breadth and depth of this exhibition had a tremendous impact on Japanese photographers, and it &quot;galvanized the discourse of art photography throughout the country.&quot; After the exhibition ended Burton and Kajima founded a new organization, the Dai Nihon Shashin Hinpyō-kai (Greater Japan Photography Critique Society) to advance their particular viewpoints on art photography.

In 1904 a new magazine called &quot;Shashin Geppo&quot; (&quot;Monthly Photo Journal&quot;) was started, and for many years it was the centerpiece for the advancement of and debates about pictorialism. The meaning and direction of art photography as championed by Ogawa and others was challenged in the new journal by photographers Tarō Saitō and Haruki Egashira, who, along with Tetsusuke Akiyama and Seiichi Katō, formed a new group known as Yūtsuzu-sha. This new group promoted their own concepts of what they called &quot;the inner truth&quot; of art photography. For the next decade many photographers aligned themselves with one of these two organizations.

In the 1920s new organizations were formed that bridged the transition between pictorialism and modernism. Most prominently among these was the Shashin Geijustu-sha (Photographic Art Society) formed by Shinzō Fukuhara and his brother Rosō Fukuhara. They promoted the concept of &quot;hikari to sono kaichō&quot; (light with its harmony) that rejected an overt manipulation of an image in favor of soft-focused images using silver gelatin printing.

===Netherlands===
The first generation of Dutch pictorialists, including , Chris Schuver, and Carl Emile Mögle, began working around 1890. They initially focused on naturalistic themes and favored platinum printing. Although initially there was no Dutch equivalent of The Linked Ring or Photo-Secession, several smaller organizations collaborated to produce the First International Salon for Art Photography in 1904. Three years later Adriann Boer, Ernest Loeb, , and others founded the Dutch Club for Art Photography (Nederlandsche Club voor Foto-Kunst), which amassed an important collection of pictorial photography now housed at Leiden University. A second generation of Dutch pictorialists included Henri Berssenbrugge, Bernard Eilers and Berend Zweers.

===Russia===
Pictorialism spread to Russia first through European magazines and was championed by photography pioneers in Russia and Jan Bulhak from Poland. Soon after a new generation of pictorialists became active. These included Aleksei Mazuin, , Piotr Klepikov, Vassily Ulitin, Nikolay Andreyev, Nikolai Svishchov-Paola, , and Alexander Grinberg. In 1894 the Russian Photographic Society was established in Moscow, but differences of opinion among the members led to the establishment of a second organization, the Moscow Society of Art Photography. Both were the primary promoters of pictorialism in Russia for many years.

===Spain===
The main centers of pictorial photography in Spain were Madrid and Barcelona. Leading the movement in Madrid was Antonio Cánovas, who founded the Real Sociedad Fotográfica de Madrid and edited the magazine . Cánovas claimed to be the first to introduce artistic photography to Spain, but throughout his career he remained rooted in the allegorical style of the early English pictorialists like Robinson. He refused to use any surface manipulation in his prints, saying that style &quot;is not, cannot be and will never be photography.&quot;. Other influential photographers in the country were , Manual Renon, and a person known only as the Conde de la Ventosa. Unlike the rest of Europe, pictorialism remained popular in Spain throughout the 1920s and 1930s, and Ventosa was the most prolific pictorialist of that period. Unfortunately very few original prints remain from any of these photographers; most of their images are now known only from magazine reproductions.

===United States===
One of the key figures in establishing both the definition and direction of pictorialism was American Alfred Stieglitz, who began as an amateur but quickly made the promotion of pictorialism his profession and obsession. Through his writings, his organizing and his personal efforts to advance and promote pictorial photographers, Stieglitz was a dominant figure in pictorialism from its beginnings to its end. Following in the footsteps of German photographers, in 1892 Stieglitz established a group he called the Photo-Secession in New York. Stieglitz hand-picked the members of the group, and he tightly controlled what it did and when it did it. By selecting photographers whose vision was aligned with his, including Gertrude Käsebier, Eva Watson-Schütze, Alvin Langdon Coburn, Edward Steichen, and Joseph Keiley, Stieglitz built a circle of friends who had enormous individual and collective influence over the movement to have photography accepted as art. Stieglitz also continually promoted pictorialism through two publications he edited, &quot;Camera Notes&quot; and &quot;Camera Work&quot; and by establishing and running a gallery in New York that for many years exhibited only pictorial photographers (the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession).

While much initially centered on Stieglitz, pictorialism in the U.S. was not limited to New York. In Boston F. Holland Day was one of the most prolific and noted pictorialists of his time. Clarence H. White, who produced extraordinary pictorial photographs while in Ohio, went on to teach a whole new generation of photographers. On the West Coast the California Camera Club and Southern California Camera Club included prominent pictorialists Annie Brigman, Arnold Genthe, Adelaide Hanscom Leeson, Emily Pitchford and William Edward Dassonville. Later on, the Seattle Camera Club was started by a group of Japanese-American pictorialists, including Dr. Kyo Koike, Frank Asakichi Kunishige and Iwao Matsushita (prominent members later included Ella E. McBride and Soichi Sunami).

==Techniques==
Pictorial photographers began by taking an ordinary glass-plate or film negative. Some adjusted the focus of the scene or used a special lens to produce a softer image, but for the most part the printing process controlled the final appearance of the photograph. Pictorialists used a variety of papers and chemical processes to produce particular effects, and some then manipulated the tones and surface of prints with brushes, ink or pigments. The following is a list of the most commonly used pictorial processes. Readers can find more details in books by Crawford and in Daum, Ribemont, and Prodger. Unless otherwise noted, the descriptions below are summarized from these two books.

*Bromoil process: This is a variant on the oil print process that allows a print to be enlarged. In this process a regular silver gelatin print is made, then bleached in a solution of potassium bichromate. This hardens the surface of the print and allows ink to stick to it. Both the lighter and darker areas of a bromoil print may be manipulated, providing a broader tonal range than an oil print.
*Carbon print: This is an extremely delicate print made by coating tissue paper with potassium bichromate, carbon black or another pigment and gelatin. Carbon prints can provide extraordinary detail and are among the most permanent of all photographic prints. Due to the stability of the paper both before and after processing, carbon printing tissue was one of the earliest commercially made photographic products.
*Cyanotype: One of the earliest photographic processes, cyanotypes experienced a brief renewal when pictorialists experimented with their deep blue color tones. The color came from coating paper with light-sensitive iron salts.
*Gum bichromate: One of the pictorialists&#x27; favorites, these prints were made by applying gum arabic, potassium bichromate and one or more artist&#x27;s colored pigments to paper. This sensitized solution slowly hardens where light strikes it, and these areas remain pliable for several hours. The photographer had a great deal of control by varying the mixture of the solution, allowing a shorter or longer exposure and by brushing or rubbing the pigmented areas after exposure.
*Oil print process: Made by applying greasy inks to paper coated with a solution of gum bichromate and gelatin. When exposed through a negative, the gum-gelatin hardens where light strikes it while unexposed areas remain soft. Artist&#x27;s inks are then applied by brush, and the inks adhere only to the hardened areas. Through this process a photographer can manipulate the lighter areas of a gum print while the darker areas remain stable. An oil print cannot be enlarged since it has to be in direct contact with the negative.
*Platinum print: Platinum prints require a two-steps process. First, paper is sensitized with iron salts and exposed in contact with a negative until a faint image is formed. Then the paper is chemically developed in a process that replaces the iron salts with platinum. This produces an image with a very wide range of tones, each intensely realized.

==Pictorial photographers==
Following are two lists of prominent photographers who engaged in pictorialism during their careers. The first list includes photographers who were predominantly pictorialists for all or almost all of their careers (generally those active from 1880 to 1920). The second list includes 20th-century photographers who used a pictorial style early in the careers but who are more well known for pure or straight photography.

<doc id="203509" wikidata="Q2424863" url="?curid=203509" title="Gerard Heymans">
<text>Gerardus Heymans (; 17 April 1857 – 18 February 1930) was a Dutch philosopher and psychologist. From 1890 to 1927, he worked as a professor of philosophy at the University of Groningen (UG). He also served as rector magnificus (president) of the UG in the academic year 1908–1909. Heymans is one of the most influential philosophers of the Netherlands and the pioneer of Dutch psychology. The establishment of his psychological laboratory marked the start of experimental psychology in the Netherlands.

==Life==
Heymans was born in Friesland as the son of the municipal secretary Jan Heijmans and his wife Sara Wijsman. He went to the HBS (Hogere Burgerschool, an old form of high school education) in Leeuwarden and then studied law and philosophy at the University of Leiden. In 1880 he obtained his doctorate in political science. After that studied philosophy at the University of Freiburg, where he obtained his doctorate in 1881. In the same year he married Anthonia Barkey in Leiden. He got work as a tutor and then as a private lecturer in philosophy at the University of Leiden.

In 1890 Heymans was appointed professor at the Faculty of Arts and Philosophy at the UG. He went on to teach philosophy and psychology. He and his wife first took up residence on the Stationsstraat in Groningen, where Heymans set up his psychological laboratory in 1892. In 1894 they moved to the villa on the Ubbo Emmiussingel that they had designed by H.P. Berlage. Heymans was Rector Magnificus of the University of Groningen from 1908 to 1909. In his speech, he outlined a future of psychology with great social value. In the following year, in 1910, his wife Anthonia died.

In 1909 Heymans was allocated a large lecture hall and space for his laboratory. His lectures were popular and attracted many students from other studies, professors and other interested parties. At one point Heymans even had to give his lectures twice. Heymans continued to publish books and articles in various fields of philosophy and psychology throughout his academic career. In 1926 he was chairman of the International Congress of Psychology that was then held in Groningen. Heymans retired in 1927. Three years later, he died after his health had deteriorated rapidly.

Heymans maintained many good friendships, including with other professors. He regularly took long walks with J. C. Kapteyn and was good friends with Enno Wiersma, a professor of psychiatry and neurology, with whom he also conducted several studies. In addition, he and his wife often received visitors and guests such as and his wife, whom he had met during his studies in Leiden.

Heymans has also been a member of several associations. From 1900 he, for example, was a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW). After the First World War, however, he cancelled his membership because the Academy did not take a neutral stance toward scientists from Germany and Austria. In 1919 Heymans became the first chairman of the Study Association for Psychical Research (SPR). This is the Dutch version of the Society for Psychical Research, which was founded in Great Britain in 1882. A few years later he stopped because there was too little interest in scientific research within the association.

In his time, Heymans was famous both in and outside of the Netherlands. He, for example, was offered positions at German universities multiple times. Heymans also received many awards. He became Commander in the Order of Orange Nassau and was an honorary member of The British Psychological Society.

==Work==
Heymans wrote several books and essays and regularly wrote for &quot;De Gids&quot;, a literary magazine. Here he wrote on a variety of topics and his dissertation was also included in this.

=== Philosophy ===
Heymans wanted to build a philosophical system based on an empirical method. When he was appointed professor, he gave a talk called &quot;the experiment in philosophy&quot;. According to Heymans, facts should be the starting point for philosophical analyses. He, however, did not think that everything could be derived from experience, such as logical laws which makes that Heymans cannot be counted as an empiricist.

==== Psychic monism ====
In his metaphysics, Heymans was concerned with philosophy of the mind. His book &quot;Einführung in die Metaphysik&quot; deals with the mind–body problem. Heymans proposed a form of psychic monism; reality consists of the mind. This is in contrast to materialism, which assumes that everything is ultimately made of matter. Heymans&#x27; theory is comparable to panpsychism in which he was influenced by Gustav Fechner. Heymans argued that everything is part of one World Consciousness and that everything is connected. Here too Heymans assumed the possibility of investigating consciousness with the empirical method. His book was well-received among the general public and other philosophers. William James, for example, called it &quot;a masterpiece of clear composition.

=== Psychology ===
Heymans was appointed professor to teach the history of philosophy, logic, metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics, and psychology. Heymans himself preferred to use the term psychology when talking about psychology.

==== General psychology ====
Heymans often compared psychology to physics. He was convinced that laws could be formulated for psychology in the same way as for the natural sciences and therefore did a lot of research into general psychological processes. He was strongly influenced by German psychology. He started doing research into psychological inhibition. An example of this phenomenon is when you have mild pain in your left arm, but then feel a worse pain in your right, the pain in your left arm will disappear. He based his research on earlier results of Weber and Fechner.

Heymans also did a lot of research into visual illusions. The best-known examples are the Müller-Lyer and the Zöllner illusion. He wanted to put all the proposed explanations to the test. He designed various setups in which subjects had to indicate when they thought the lines were of equal length (Müller-Lyer) or were running parallel (Zöllner). He published both studies, that of illusions and psychological inhibition, in the &quot;Zeitschrift für Psychologie&quot;.

==== Special psychology ====
Whereas general psychology focuses on shared psychological processes, special psychology (or differential psychology) focuses on the differences between people. Here too Heymans has had a major influence. Eysenck, a British personality psychologist, called him, for example, one of the founders of personality psychology. Heymans was in fact the first psychologist to base a typology, a classification of personality types, on empirical research. This typology is known as the Heymans&#x27; Cube (see figure 1). It consists of eight types placed on three different dimensions. Heymans based his typology on the biographies of well-known people, such as Goethe and Napoleon, and survey research.

=== Parapsychology ===
At the end of the nineteenth and early twentieth century, there was also a great deal of interest within psychology in parapsychology (then psychological research). Among them were well-known psychologists such as William James, Alfred Binet, Francis Galton, and also Heymans. Between 1920 and 1923, Heymans conducted multiple experiments to investigate telepathy. Figure 2 shows the experimental set-up, in which Van Dam sat behind the curtain and had to pick up signals from the experimenter who in his mind guided the subject&#x27;s hand.

== Psychological laboratory ==

Heymans&#x27; psychological laboratory started as a room in his house on Stationsstraat in 1892. For the construction of the villa on Ubbo Emmiussingel, they made sure there was a proper place for the laboratory. It was located on the waterfront and had extra thick walls to block out as much noise as possible. Until 1909 Heymans conducted his experiments here using his wife as the primary test subject. Heymans had a large collection of devices for his experiments. They were purchased and made for education and demonstration purposes, and to make psychology education attractive. Most of these devices were intended for sensory perception research.

When in 1906 the Academy Building was largely destroyed by fire, plans for a new building were quickly drawn up. In this new building, there would also be room for Heymans&#x27; laboratory. The space that Heymans had at his disposal consisted of a large lecture hall and four workrooms. One of those rooms was specially equipped for visual and auditory experiments. From then on, practicals were also given more often and students had the chance to experiment themselves, by replicating experiments and participating as test subjects.

In 1927 Heymans handed over the management to his former lab assistant and at that time lecturer in pedagogy Henri Brugmans. Until 1956, the lab was located in the Academy Building of the University of Groningen.

== Publications ==
In his life, Heymans has written a lot of articles and multiple books. Some of the more famous are:
* 1905. &quot;Einführung in die Metaphysik, auf Grundlage der Erfahrung&quot;

<text>Social constructionism is a term used in sociology, social ontology, and communication theory. The term can serve somewhat different functions in each field; however, the foundation of this theoretical framework suggests various facets of social reality—such as concepts, beliefs, norms, and values—are formed through continuous interactions and negotiations among society&#x27;s members, rather than empirical observation of physical reality. The theory of social constructionism posits that much of what individuals perceive as &#x27;reality&#x27; is actually the outcome of a dynamic process of construction influenced by social conventions and structures.

Unlike phenomena that are innately determined or biologically predetermined, these social constructs are collectively formulated, sustained, and shaped by the social contexts in which they exist. These constructs significantly impact both the behavior and perceptions of individuals, often being internalized based on cultural narratives, whether or not these are empirically verifiable. In this two-way process of reality construction, individuals not only interpret and assimilate information through their social relations but also contribute to shaping existing societal narratives.

Examples of social constructs range widely, encompassing the assigned value of money, conceptions of concept of self, self-identity, beauty standards, gender, language, race, ethnicity, social class, social hierarchy, nationality, religion, social norms, the modern calendar and other units of time, marriage, education, citizenship, stereotypes, femininity and masculinity, social institutions, and even the idea of &#x27;social construct&#x27; itself. These constructs are not universal truths but are flexible entities that can vary dramatically across different cultures and societies. They arise from collaborative consensus and are shaped and maintained through collective human interactions, cultural practices, and shared beliefs. This articulates the view that people in society construct ideas or concepts that may not exist without the existence of people or language to validate those concepts, meaning without a society these constructs would cease to exist.

== Overview ==
A social construct or construction is the meaning, notion, or connotation placed on an object or event by a society, and adopted by that society with respect to how they view or deal with the object or event.

The social construction of target populations refers to the cultural characterizations or popular images of the persons or groups whose behavior and well-being are affected by public policy.

Social constructionism posits that the meanings of phenomena do not have an independent foundation outside the mental and linguistic representation that people develop about them throughout their history, and which becomes their shared reality. From a linguistic viewpoint, social constructionism centres meaning as an internal reference within language (words refer to words, definitions to other definitions) rather than to an external reality.

== Origins ==

In his 1922 book &quot;Public Opinion&quot;, Walter Lippmann said, &quot;The real environment is altogether too big, too complex, and too fleeting for direct acquaintance&quot; between people and their environment. Each person constructs a pseudo-environment that is a subjective, biased, and necessarily abridged mental image of the world, and to a degree, everyone&#x27;s pseudo-environment is a fiction. People &quot;live in the same world, but they think and feel in different ones.&quot; Lippman&#x27;s &quot;environment&quot; might be called &quot;reality&quot;, and his &quot;pseudo-environment&quot; seems equivalent to what today is called &quot;constructed reality&quot;.

Social constructionism has more recently been rooted in &quot;symbolic interactionism&quot; and &quot;phenomenology&quot;. With Berger and Luckmann&#x27;s &quot;The Social Construction of Reality&quot; published in 1966, this concept found its hold. More than four decades later, much theory and research pledged itself to the basic tenet that people &quot;make their social and cultural worlds at the same time these worlds make them.&quot; It is a viewpoint that uproots social processes &quot;simultaneously playful and serious, by which reality is both revealed and concealed, created and destroyed by our activities.&quot; It provides a substitute to the &quot;Western intellectual tradition&quot; where the researcher &quot;earnestly seeks certainty in a representation of reality by means of propositions.&quot;

In social constructionist terms, &quot;taken-for-granted realities&quot; are cultivated from &quot;interactions between and among social agents&quot;; furthermore, reality is not some objective truth &quot;waiting to be uncovered through positivist scientific inquiry.&quot; Rather, there can be &quot;multiple realities that compete for truth and legitimacy.&quot; Social constructionism understands the &quot;fundamental role of language and communication&quot; and this understanding has &quot;contributed to the linguistic turn&quot; and more recently the &quot;turn to discourse theory&quot;. The majority of social constructionists abide by the belief that &quot;language does not mirror reality; rather, it constitutes [creates] it.&quot;

A broad definition of social constructionism has its supporters and critics in the organizational sciences. A constructionist approach to various organizational and managerial phenomena appear to be more commonplace and on the rise.

Andy Lock and Tom Strong trace some of the fundamental tenets of social constructionism back to the work of the 18th-century Italian political philosopher, rhetorician, historian, and jurist Giambattista Vico.

Berger and Luckmann give credit to Max Scheler as a large influence as he created the idea of sociology of knowledge which influenced social construction theory.

According to Lock and Strong, other influential thinkers whose work has affected the development of social constructionism are: Edmund Husserl, Alfred Schutz, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Martin Heidegger, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Paul Ricoeur, Jürgen Habermas, Emmanuel Levinas, Mikhail Bakhtin, Valentin Volosinov, Lev Vygotsky, George Herbert Mead, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Gregory Bateson, Harold Garfinkel, Erving Goffman, Anthony Giddens, Michel Foucault, Ken Gergen, Mary Gergen, Rom Harre, and John Shotter.

== Applications ==
===Personal construct psychology===
Since its appearance in the 1950s, personal construct psychology (PCP) has mainly developed as a constructivist theory of personality and a system of transforming individual meaning-making processes, largely in therapeutic contexts. It was based around the notion of persons as scientists who form and test theories about their worlds. Therefore, it represented one of the first attempts to appreciate the constructive nature of experience and the meaning persons give to their experience. Social constructionism (SC), on the other hand, mainly developed as a form of a critique, aimed to transform the oppressing effects of the social meaning-making processes. Over the years, it has grown into a cluster of different approaches, with no single SC position. However, different approaches under the generic term of SC are loosely linked by some shared assumptions about language, knowledge, and reality.

A usual way of thinking about the relationship between PCP and SC is treating them as two separate entities that are similar in some aspects, but also very different in others. This way of conceptualizing this relationship is a logical result of the circumstantial differences of their emergence. In subsequent analyses these differences between PCP and SC were framed around several points of tension, formulated as binary oppositions: personal/social; individualist/relational; agency/structure; constructivist/constructionist. Although some of the most important issues in contemporary psychology are elaborated in these contributions, the polarized positioning also sustained the idea of a separation between PCP and SC, paving the way for only limited opportunities for dialogue between them.

Reframing the relationship between PCP and SC may be of use in both the PCP and the SC communities. On one hand, it extends and enriches SC theory and points to benefits of applying the PCP &quot;toolkit&quot; in constructionist therapy and research. On the other hand, the reframing contributes to PCP theory and points to new ways of addressing social construction in therapeutic conversations.

===Educational psychology===
Like social constructionism, social constructivism states that people work together to construct artifacts. While social constructionism focuses on the artifacts that are created through the social interactions of a group, social constructivism focuses on an individual&#x27;s learning that takes place because of his or her interactions in a group.

Social constructivism has been studied by many educational psychologists, who are concerned with its implications for teaching and learning. For more on the psychological dimensions of social constructivism, see the work of Lev Vygotsky, Ernst von Glasersfeld and A. Sullivan Palincsar.

===Systemic therapy===
Some of the systemic models that use social constructionism include narrative therapy and solution-focused therapy.

=== Poverty ===
Max Rose and Frank R. Baumgartner (2013), in &quot;Framing the Poor: Media Coverage and U.S. Poverty Policy, 1960-2008&quot;, examine how media has framed the poor in the U.S. and how negative framing has caused a shift in government spending. Since 1960, the government has decreasingly spent money on social services such as welfare. Evidence shows the media framing the poor more negatively since 1960, with more usage of words such as &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;fraud&quot;.

=== Crime ===

Potter and Kappeler (1996), in their introduction to &quot;Constructing Crime: Perspective on Making News And Social Problems&quot; wrote, &quot;Public opinion and crime facts demonstrate no congruence. The reality of crime in the United States has been subverted to a constructed reality as ephemeral as swamp gas.&quot;

Criminology has long focussed on why and how society defines criminal behavior and crime in general. While looking at crime through a social constructionism lens, there is evidence to support that criminal acts are a social construct where abnormal or deviant acts become a crime based on the views of society. Another explanation of crime as it relates to social constructionism are individual identity constructs that result in deviant behavior. If someone has constructed the identity of a &quot;madman&quot; or &quot;criminal&quot; for themselves based on a society&#x27;s definition, it may force them to follow that label, resulting in criminal behavior.

== History and development ==
===Berger and Luckmann===
Constructionism became prominent in the U.S. with Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann&#x27;s 1966 book, &quot;The Social Construction of Reality&quot;. Berger and Luckmann argue that all knowledge, including the most basic, taken-for-granted common-sense knowledge of everyday reality, is derived from and maintained by social interactions. In their model, people interact on the understanding that their perceptions of everyday life are shared with others, and this common knowledge of reality is in turn reinforced by these interactions. Since this common-sense knowledge is negotiated by people, human typifications, significations and institutions come to be presented as part of an objective reality, particularly for future generations who were not involved in the original process of negotiation. For example, as parents negotiate rules for their children to follow, those rules confront the children as externally produced &quot;givens&quot; that they cannot change. Berger and Luckmann&#x27;s social constructionism has its roots in phenomenology. It links to Heidegger and Edmund Husserl through the teaching of Alfred Schutz, who was also Berger&#x27;s PhD adviser.

===Narrative turn===
During the 1970s and 1980s, social constructionist theory underwent a transformation as constructionist sociologists engaged with the work of Michel Foucault and others as a narrative turn in the social sciences was worked out in practice. This particularly affected the emergent sociology of science and the growing field of science and technology studies. In particular, Karin Knorr-Cetina, Bruno Latour, Barry Barnes, Steve Woolgar, and others used social constructionism to relate what science has typically characterized as objective facts to the processes of social construction. Their goal was to show that human subjectivity imposes itself on the facts taken as objective, not solely the other way around. A particularly provocative title in this line of thought is Andrew Pickering&#x27;s &quot;Constructing Quarks: A Sociological History of Particle Physics&quot;. At the same time, social constructionism shaped studies of technologythe Sofield, especially on the social construction of technology, or SCOT, and authors as Wiebe Bijker, Trevor Pinch, Maarten van Wesel, etc. Despite its common perception as objective, mathematics is not immune to social constructionist accounts. Sociologists such as Sal Restivo and Randall Collins, mathematicians including Reuben Hersh and Philip J. Davis, and philosophers including Paul Ernest have published social constructionist treatments of mathematics.

===Postmodernism===

Within the social constructionist strand of postmodernism, the concept of socially constructed reality stresses the ongoing mass-building of worldviews by individuals in dialectical interaction with society at a time. The numerous realities so formed comprise, according to this view, the imagined worlds of human social existence and activity. These worldviews are gradually crystallized by habit into institutions propped up by language conventions; given ongoing legitimacy by mythology, religion and philosophy; maintained by therapies and socialization; and subjectively internalized by upbringing and education. Together, these become part of the identity of social citizens.

In the book &quot;The Reality of Social Construction&quot;, the British sociologist Dave Elder-Vass places the development of social constructionism as one outcome of the legacy of postmodernism. He writes &quot;Perhaps the most widespread and influential product of this process [coming to terms with the legacy of postmodernism] is social constructionism, which has been booming [within the domain of social theory] since the 1980s.&quot;

== Criticisms ==
Critics argue that social constructionism rejects the influences of biology on behaviour and culture, or suggests that they are unimportant to achieve an understanding of human behaviour. Scientific estimates of nature versus nurture and gene–environment interactions have shown almost always substantial influences of both genetics and social, often in an inseparable manner. Claims that genetics does not affect humans are seen as outdated by most contemporary scholars of human development.

Social constructionism has also been criticized for having an overly narrow focus on society and culture as a causal factor in human behavior, excluding the influence of innate biological tendencies. This criticism has been explored by psychologists such as Steven Pinker in &quot;The Blank Slate&quot; as well as by Asian studies scholar Edward Slingerland in &quot;What Science Offers the Humanities&quot;. John Tooby and Leda Cosmides used the term &quot;standard social science model&quot; to refer to social theories that they believe fail to take into account the evolved properties of the brain.

In 1996, to illustrate what he believed to be the intellectual weaknesses of social constructionism and postmodernism, physics professor Alan Sokal submitted an article to the academic journal &quot;Social Text&quot; deliberately written to be incomprehensible but including phrases and jargon typical of the articles published by the journal. The submission, which was published, was an experiment to see if the journal would &quot;publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors&#x27; ideological preconceptions.&quot; In 1999, Sokal, with coauthor Jean Bricmont published the book &quot;Fashionable Nonsense&quot;, which criticized postmodernism and social constructionism.

Philosopher Paul Boghossian has also written against social constructionism. He follows Ian Hacking&#x27;s argument that many adopt social constructionism because of its potentially liberating stance: if things are the way that they are only because of human social conventions, as opposed to being so naturally, then it should be possible to change them into how people would rather have them be. He then states that social constructionists argue that people should refrain from making absolute judgements about what is true and instead state that something is true in the light of this or that theory. Countering this, he states:

Woolgar and Pawluch argue that constructionists tend to &quot;ontologically gerrymander&quot; social conditions in and out of their analysis.

Alan Sokal also criticizes social constructionism for contradicting itself on the knowability of the existence of societies. The argument is that if there was no knowable objective reality, there would be no way of knowing whether or not societies exist and if so, what their rules and other characteristics are. One example of the contradiction is that the claim that &quot;phenomena must be measured by what is considered average in their respective cultures, not by an objective standard.&quot; Since there are languages that have no word for average and therefore the whole application of the concept of &quot;average&quot; to such cultures contradict social constructionism&#x27;s own claim that cultures can only be measured by their own standards. Social constructionism is a diverse field with varying stances on these matters. Some social constructionists do acknowledge the existence of an objective reality but argue that human understanding and interpretation of that reality are socially constructed. Others might contend that while the term &quot;average&quot; may not exist in all languages, equivalent or analogous concepts might still be applied within those cultures, thereby not completely invalidating the principle of cultural relativity in measuring phenomena.

<text>Social constructivism is a sociological theory of knowledge according to which human development is socially situated, and knowledge is constructed through interaction with others. Like social constructionism, social constructivism states that people work together to actively construct artifacts. But while social constructivism focuses on cognition, social constructionism focuses on the making of social reality.

A very simple example is an object like a cup. The object can be used for many things, but its shape does suggest some &#x27;knowledge&#x27; about carrying liquids (see also Affordance). A more complex example is an online course—not only do the &#x27;shapes&#x27; of the software tools indicate certain things about the way online courses should work, but the activities and texts produced within the group as a whole will help shape how each person behaves within that group. A person&#x27;s cognitive development will also be influenced by the culture that they are involved in, such as the language, history, and social context. For a philosophical account of one possible social-constructionist ontology, see the &#x27;Criticism&#x27; section of &quot;Representative realism&quot;.

==Philosophy==
Strong social constructivism as a philosophical approach tends to suggest that &quot;the natural world has a small or non-existent role in the construction of scientific knowledge&quot;. According to Maarten Boudry and Filip Buekens, Freudian psychoanalysis is a good example of this approach in action. However, Boudry and Buekens do not claim that &#x27;bona fide&#x27; science is completely immune from all socialisation and paradigm shifts, merely that the strong social constructivist claim that &quot;all&quot; scientific knowledge is constructed ignores the reality of scientific success.

One characteristic of social constructivism is that it rejects the role of superhuman necessity in either the invention/discovery of knowledge or its justification. In the field of invention it looks to contingency as playing an important part in the origin of knowledge, with historical interests and resourcing swaying the direction of mathematical and scientific knowledge growth. In the area of justification while acknowledging the role of logic and reason in testing, it also accepts that the criteria for acceptance vary and change over time. Thus mathematical proofs follow different standards in the present and throughout different periods in the past, as Paul Ernest argues.

==Education==
Social constructivism has been studied by many educational psychologists, who are concerned with its implications for teaching and learning. Social constructivism extends constructivism by incorporating the role of other actors and culture in development. In this sense it can also be contrasted with social learning theory by stressing interaction over observation. For more on the psychological dimensions of social constructivism, see the work of A. Sullivan Palincsar. Psychological tools are one of the key concepts in Lev Vygotsky&#x27;s sociocultural perspective.

Studies on increasing the use of student discussion in the classroom both support and are grounded in theories of social constructivism. There is a full range of advantages that results from the implementation of discussion in the classroom. Participating in group discussion allows students to generalize and transfer their knowledge of classroom learning and builds a strong foundation for communicating ideas orally. Many studies argue that discussion plays a vital role in increasing student ability to test their ideas, synthesize the ideas of others, and build deeper understanding of what they are learning. Large and small group discussion also affords students opportunities to exercise self-regulation, self-determination, and a desire to persevere with tasks. Additionally, discussion increases student motivation, collaborative skills, and the ability to problem solve. Increasing students’ opportunity to talk with one another and discuss their ideas increases their ability to support their thinking, develop reasoning skills, and to argue their opinions persuasively and respectfully. Furthermore, the feeling of community and collaboration in classrooms increases through offering more chances for students to talk together.

Studies have found that students are not regularly accustomed to participating in academic discourse. Martin Nystrand argues that teachers rarely choose classroom discussion as an instructional format. The results of Nystrand’s (1996) three-year study focusing on 2400 students in 60 different classrooms indicate that the typical classroom teacher spends under three minutes an hour allowing students to talk about ideas with one another and the teacher. Even within those three minutes of discussion, most talk is not true discussion because it depends upon teacher-directed questions with predetermined answers. Multiple observations indicate that students in low socioeconomic schools and lower track classrooms are allowed even fewer opportunities for discussion. Discussion and interactive discourse promote learning because they afford students the opportunity to use language as a demonstration of their independent thoughts. Discussion elicits sustained responses from students that encourage meaning-making through negotiating with the ideas of others. This type of learning “promotes retention and in-depth processing associated with the cognitive manipulation of information”.

One recent branch of work exploring social constructivist perspectives on learning focuses on the role of social technologies and social media in facilitating the generation of socially constructed knowledge and understanding in online environments.

===Academic writing===
In a constructivist approach, the focus is on the sociocultural conventions of academic discourse such as citing evidence, hedging and boosting claims, interpreting the literature to back one&#x27;s own claims, and addressing counter claims. These conventions are inherent to a constructivist approach as they place value on the communicative, interpersonal nature of academic writing with a strong focus on how the reader receives the message. The act of citing others’ work is more than accurate attribution; it is an important exercise in critical thinking in the construction of an authorial self.

<text>AbdullahI bin Al-Hussein (, 2 February 1882 – 20 July 1951) was the ruler of Jordan from 11 April 1921 until his assassination in 1951. He was the Emir of Transjordan, a British protectorate, until 25 May 1946, after which he was king of an independent Jordan. As a member of the Hashemite dynasty, the royal family of Jordan since 1921, Abdullah was a 38th-generation direct descendant of Muhammad.

Born in Mecca, Hejaz, Ottoman Empire, Abdullah was the second of four sons of Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca, and his first wife, Abdiyya bint Abdullah. He was educated in Istanbul and Hejaz. From 1909 to 1914, Abdullah sat in the Ottoman legislature, as deputy for Mecca, but allied with Britain during the First World War. During the war, he played a key role in secret negotiations with the United Kingdom that led to the Great Arab Revolt against Ottoman rule that was led by his father Sharif Hussein. Abdullah personally led guerrilla raids on garrisons.

Abdullah became emir of Transjordan in April 1921. He upheld his alliance with the British during World War II, and became king after Transjordan gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1946. In 1949, Jordan annexed the West Bank, which angered Arab countries including Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. He was assassinated in Jerusalem while attending Friday prayers at the entrance of the Al-Aqsa Mosque by a Palestinian in 1951. Abdullah was succeeded by his eldest son Talal.

==Early political career==

In 1910, Abdullah persuaded his father to stand, successfully, for Grand Sharif of Mecca, a post for which Hussein acquired British support. In the following year, he became deputy for Mecca in the parliament established by the Young Turks, acting as an intermediary between his father and the Ottoman government. In 1914, Abdullah paid a clandestine visit to Cairo to meet Lord Kitchener, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Secretary of State for War, to seek British support for his father&#x27;s ambitions in Arabia.

Abdullah maintained contact with the British throughout the First World War and in 1915 encouraged his father to enter into correspondence with Sir Henry McMahon, British high commissioner in Egypt, about Arab independence from Turkish rule (see McMahon–Hussein Correspondence). This correspondence in turn led to the Arab Revolt against the Ottomans. During the Arab Revolt of 1916–18, Abdullah commanded the Arab Eastern Army. Abdullah began his role in the Revolt by attacking the Ottoman garrison at Ta&#x27;if on 10 June 1916. The garrison consisted of 3,000 men with ten 75-mm Krupp guns. Abdullah led a force of 5,000 tribesmen, but they did not have the weapons or discipline for a full attack. Instead, he laid siege to town. In July, he received reinforcements from Egypt in the form of howitzer batteries manned by Egyptian personnel. He then joined the siege of Medina commanding a force of 4,000 men based to the east and north-east of the town. In early 1917, Abdullah ambushed an Ottoman convoy in the desert, and captured £20,000 worth of gold coins that were intended to bribe the Bedouin into loyalty to the Sultan. In August 1917, Abdullah worked closely with the French Captain Muhammand Ould Ali Raho in sabotaging the Hejaz Railway. Abdullah&#x27;s relations with the British Captain T. E. Lawrence were not good, and as a result, Lawrence spent most of his time in the Hejaz serving with Abdullah&#x27;s brother, Faisal, who commanded the Arab Northern Army.

==Founding of the Emirate of Transjordan==


On 8 March 1920, Abdullah was proclaimed King of Iraq by the Iraqi Congress but he refused the position. After his refusal, his brother Faisal who had just been defeated in Syria, accepted the position. When French forces captured Damascus after the Battle of Maysalun (24 July 1920) and expelled his brother Faisal (27 July–1 August 1920), Abdullah moved his forces from Hejaz into Transjordan with a view to liberating Damascus, where his brother had been proclaimed King in 1918. Having heard of Abdullah&#x27;s plans, Winston Churchill invited Abdullah to Cairo in 1921 for a famous &quot;tea party&quot;, where he convinced Abdullah to stay put and not attack Britain&#x27;s allies, the French. Churchill told Abdullah that French forces were superior to his and that the British did not want any trouble with the French. Abdullah headed to Transjordan and established an emirate there on 11 April 1921 after being welcomed into the country by its inhabitants.

Although Abdullah established a legislative council in 1928, its role remained advisory, leaving him to rule as an autocrat. Prime ministers under Abdullah formed 18 governments during the 23 years of the Emirate.

Abdullah set about the task of building Transjordan with the help of a reserve force headed by Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick Peake, who was seconded from the Palestine police in 1921. The force, renamed the Arab Legion in 1923, was led by John Bagot Glubb between 1930 and 1956. During World War II, Abdullah was a faithful British ally, maintaining strict order within Transjordan, and helping to suppress a pro-Axis uprising in Iraq. The Arab Legion assisted in the occupation of Iraq and Syria.

==Expansionist aspirations==

Abdullah negotiated with Britain to gain independence. On 25 May 1946, the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan (renamed the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on 26 April 1949) was proclaimed independent. On the same day, Abdullah was crowned king in Amman.

Abdullah, alone among the Arab leaders of his generation, was considered a moderate by the West. It is possible that he might have been willing to sign a separate peace agreement with Israel, but for the Arab League&#x27;s militant opposition. Because of his dream for a Greater Syria within the borders of what was then Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine under a Hashemite dynasty with &quot;a throne in Damascus,&quot; many Arab countries distrusted Abdullah and saw him as both &quot;a threat to the independence of their countries and they also suspected him of being in cahoots with the enemy&quot; and in return, Abdullah distrusted the leaders of other Arab countries.

Abdullah supported the Peel Commission in 1937, which proposed that Palestine be split up into a small Jewish state (20 percent of the British Mandate for Palestine) and the remaining land be annexed into Transjordan. The Arabs within Palestine and the surrounding Arab countries objected to the Peel Commission while the Jews accepted it reluctantly. Ultimately, the Peel Commission was not adopted. In 1947, when the UN supported partition of Palestine into one Jewish and one Arab state, Abdullah was the only Arab leader supporting the decision.

In 1946–48, Abdullah supported partition in order that the Arab allocated areas of the British Mandate for Palestine could be annexed into Transjordan. Abdullah went so far as to have secret meetings with the Jewish Agency for Israel. Future Israeli prime minister Golda Meir was among the delegates to these meetings that came to a mutually agreed upon partition plan independently of the United Nations in November 1947. On 17 November 1947, in a secret meeting with Golda Meir, Abdullah stated that he wished to annex all of the Arab parts as a minimum, and would prefer to annex all of Palestine. This partition plan was supported by British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin who preferred to see Abdullah&#x27;s territory increased at the expense of the Palestinians rather than risk the creation of a Palestinian state headed by the Mufti of Jerusalem Mohammad Amin al-Husayni.
Historian Graham Jevon discusses the Shlaim and Karsh interpretations of the critical meeting and accepts that there may not have been a &quot;firm agreement&quot; as posited by Shlaim while claiming it is clear that the parties openly discussed the possibility of a Hashemite-Zionist accommodation and further says it is &quot;indisputable&quot; that the Zionists confirmed that they were willing to accept Abdullah&#x27;s intention.

On 4 May 1948, Abdullah, as a part of the effort to seize as much of Palestine as possible, sent in the Arab Legion to attack the Israeli settlements in the Etzion Bloc. Less than a week before the outbreak of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Abdullah met with Meir for one last time on 11 May 1948. Abdullah told Meir, &quot;Why are you in such a hurry to proclaim your state? Why don&#x27;t you wait a few years? I will take over the whole country and you will be represented in my parliament. I will treat you very well and there will be no war&quot;. Abdullah proposed to Meir the creation &quot;of an autonomous Jewish canton within a Hashemite kingdom,&quot; but &quot;Meir countered back that in November, they had agreed on a partition with Jewish statehood.&quot; Depressed by the unavoidable war that would come between Jordan and the Yishuv, one Jewish Agency representative wrote, &quot;[Abdullah] will not remain faithful to the 29 November [UN Partition] borders, but [he] will not attempt to conquer all of our state [either].&quot; Abdullah too found the coming war to be unfortunate, in part because he &quot;preferred a Jewish state [as Transjordan&#x27;s neighbour] to a Palestinian Arab state run by the mufti.&quot;

The Palestinian Arabs, the neighbouring Arab states, the promise of the expansion of territory and the goal to conquer Jerusalem finally pressured Abdullah into joining them in an &quot;all-Arab military intervention&quot; on 15 May 1948. He used the military intervention to restore his prestige in the Arab world, which had grown suspicious of his relatively good relationship with Western and Jewish leaders. Abdullah was especially anxious to take Jerusalem as compensation for the loss of the guardianship of Mecca, which had traditionally been held by the Hashemites until Ibn Saud seized the Hejaz in 1925. Abdullah&#x27;s role in this war became substantial. He distrusted the leaders of the other Arab nations and thought they had weak military forces; the other Arabs distrusted Abdullah in return. He saw himself as the &quot;supreme commander of the Arab forces&quot; and &quot;persuaded the Arab League to appoint him&quot; to this position. His forces under their British commander Glubb Pasha did not approach the area set aside for the Jewish state, though they clashed with the Yishuv forces around Jerusalem, intended to be an international zone. According to Abdullah el-Tell it was the King&#x27;s personal intervention that led to the Arab Legion entering the Old City against Glubb&#x27;s wishes.

On 16 July 1951, Riad Al Solh, a former prime minister of Lebanon, had been assassinated in Amman, where rumours were circulating that Lebanon and Jordan were discussing a joint separate peace with Israel.

==Assassination==

On July 20, 1951, King Abdullah of Jordan was assassinated while visiting Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem by Mustafa Shukri Ashu, a Palestinian tailor&#x27;s apprentice associated with a group seeking an independent Palestinian state. Abdullah, who was accompanied by his grandson Prince Hussein, was shot during Friday prayers, with three fatal bullets hitting his head and chest. Prince Hussein survived when a medal he wore deflected a bullet. The assassination was attributed to a secret group linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, with political ties to the former Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. The assassin was shot dead by Abdullah&#x27;s guards, and several individuals, including Colonel Abdullah at-Tell and members of the Husseini family, were later implicated in the plot. Abdullah&#x27;s death led to his son Talal&#x27;s succession, but Talal&#x27;s mental illness meant his son Hussein effectively became king. The assassination is thought to have influenced Hussein&#x27;s decision not to pursue peace talks with Israel after the Six-Day War.

==Marriages and children==

Abdullah married three times.

In 1904, Abdullah married his first wife, Sharifa Musbah bint Nasser (1884 – 15 March 1961), at Stinia Palace, İstinye, Istanbul, Ottoman Empire. She was a daughter of Emir Nasser Pasha and his wife, Dilber Khanum. They had three children:

* Princess Haya (1907–1990). Married Abdul-Karim Ja&#x27;afar Zeid Dhaoui.
* King Talal (26 February 1909 – 7 July 1972).
* Princess Munira (1915–1987). Never married.

In 1913, Abdullah married his second wife, Suzdil Khanum (d. 16 August 1968), in Istanbul, Turkey. They had two children:
* Prince Nayef bin Abdullah (14 November 1914 – 12 October 1983; a colonel of the Royal Jordanian Land Force. Regent for his older half-brother, Talal, from 20 July to 3 September 1951). Married in Cairo or Amman on 7 October 1940 Princess Mihrimah Sultan (11 November 1922 – March 2000, Amman, and buried in Istanbul on 2 April 2000), daughter of the Ottoman prince, Şehzade Mehmed Ziyaeddin (1873–1938) and his fifth consort, Neşemend Hanım (1905–1934), and paternal granddaughter of Mehmed V through his first consort.
* Princess Maqbula (6 February 1921 – 1 January 2001); married Hussein ibn Nasser, Prime Minister of Jordan (terms 1963–64, 1967).

In 1949, Abdullah married his third wife, Nahda bint Uman, a lady from Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, in Amman. They had one child:
* Princess Naifeh (1950–); married Sameer Hilal Ashour.

<doc id="203515" wikidata="Q29217438" url="?curid=203515" title="List of prime ministers of Luxembourg">
<text>The prime minister of Luxembourg (; ; ) is the head of government of Luxembourg. The prime minister leads the executive branch, chairs the Cabinet and appoints its ministers.

Since 1989, the title of &quot;Prime Minister&quot; has been an official one, although the head of the government had been unofficially known by that name for some time. Between 1857 and 1989, the prime minister was styled the &quot;President of the Government&quot;, with the exception of the 25-day premiership of Mathias Mongenast. Before 1857, the prime minister was the &quot;President of the Council&quot;. In addition to these titles, the prime minister uses the title &quot;Minister of State&quot;, although this is usually relegated to a secondary title.

This is a list of prime ministers and governments since the post was founded, in 1848. In larger font are the dates of the prime ministers entering and leaving office. The smaller dates, during the respective premierships, are those of the prime ministers&#x27; governments. Luxembourg has a collegial governmental system; often, the government will present its resignation, only for the successor government to include many, if not most, of the previous ministers serving under the same prime minister. Each of the smaller dates reflects a change in the government without a change of prime minister.

==Era of independents (1848–1918)==
From the promulgation of the first constitution, in 1848, until the early twentieth century, Luxembourgish politics was dominated by independent politicians and statesmen. The prerogative powers of the grand duke remained undiluted, and, as such, the monarch actively chose and personally appointed the prime minister. As a result, the prime minister was often a moderate, without any strong affiliation no 
to either of the two major ideological factions in the Chamber of Deputies: the secularist liberals and the Catholic conservatives.

In the early twentieth century, the emergence of socialism as a third force in Luxembourgish politics ended the dominance of independents, and further politicised the government of the country. This did not affect the prime minister&#x27;s position until 1915, when the long-serving Paul Eyschen died in office. His death created a struggle for power between the main factions, leading to the establishment of the formalised party system.

===Prime ministers from 1848 to 1890===

The Kingdom of the Netherlands shared the same monarchs with the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg from 1815 to 1890. The Grand Duchy has had its own monarchs since 1890.

===Prime ministers from 1890 to 1918===


==Party system (1918–present)==
In 1918, towards the end of World War I, a new Chamber of Deputies was elected with the explicit ambition of reviewing the constitution. To this end, formalised parties were formed by the main political blocs, so as to increase their bargaining power in the negotiations. The revisions to the constitution introduced universal suffrage and compulsory voting, adopted proportional representation, and limited the sovereignty of the monarch.

Since the foundation of the party system, only one cabinet (between 1921 and 1925) has not included members of more than one party. Most of the time, governments are grand coalitions of the two largest parties, no matter their ideology; this has made Luxembourg one of the most stable democracies in the world. Two cabinets (between 1945 and 1947) included members of every party represented in the Chamber of Deputies.

During the occupation of Luxembourg by Nazi Germany in World War II, Luxembourg was governed by a Nazi Party official, Gustav Simon. Pierre Dupong continued to lead the government in exile in the United Kingdom until the liberation of Luxembourg in December 1944, whereupon the constitutional Luxembourg government returned to the Grand Duchy. Thus, although Luxembourg was formally annexed on 30 August 1942, the prime minister of the government in exile, Pierre Dupong, is assumed to have remained prime minister throughout.

<doc id="203523" wikidata="Q1503307" url="?curid=203523" title="Geometric Brownian motion">
<text>A geometric Brownian motion (GBM) (also known as exponential Brownian motion) is a continuous-time stochastic process in which the logarithm of the randomly varying quantity follows a Brownian motion (also called a Wiener process) with drift. It is an important example of stochastic processes satisfying a stochastic differential equation (SDE); in particular, it is used in mathematical finance to model stock prices in the Black–Scholes model.

==Technical definition: the SDE==

A stochastic process &quot;S&quot;&quot;t&quot; is said to follow a GBM if it satisfies the following stochastic differential equation (SDE):

:formula_1

where formula_2 is a Wiener process or Brownian motion, and formula_3 (&#x27;the percentage drift&#x27;) and formula_4 (&#x27;the percentage volatility&#x27;) are constants.

The former parameter is used to model deterministic trends, while the latter parameter models unpredictable events occurring during the motion.

==Solving the SDE==

For an arbitrary initial value &quot;S&quot;0 the above SDE has the analytic solution (under Itô&#x27;s interpretation):

: formula_5

The derivation requires the use of Itô calculus. Applying Itô&#x27;s formula leads to

: formula_6

where formula_7 is the quadratic variation of the SDE. 

:formula_8

When formula_9, formula_10 converges to 0 faster than formula_11, 
since formula_12. So the above infinitesimal can be simplified by 

:formula_13

Plugging the value of formula_14 in the above equation and simplifying we obtain

: formula_15

Taking the exponential and multiplying both sides by formula_16 gives the solution claimed above.

== Arithmetic Brownian Motion ==
The process for formula_17, satisfying the SDE 

: formula_18

or more generally the process solving the SDE

: formula_19

where formula_20 and formula_21 are real constants and for an initial condition formula_22, is called an Arithmetic Brownian Motion (ABM). This was the model postulated by Louis Bachelier in 1900 for stock prices, in the first published attempt to model Brownian motion, known today as Bachelier model. As was shown above, the ABM SDE can be obtained through the logarithm of a GBM via Itô&#x27;s formula. Similarly, a GBM can be obtained by exponentiation of an ABM through Itô&#x27;s formula. 

==Properties of GBM==

The above solution formula_23 (for any value of t) is a log-normally distributed random variable with expected value and variance given by

:formula_24
:formula_25

They can be derived using the fact that formula_26 is a martingale, and that

:formula_27

The probability density function of formula_23 is:
: formula_29

To derive the probability density function for GBM, we must use the Fokker-Planck equation to evaluate the time evolution of the PDF:

:formula_30

where formula_31 is the Dirac delta function. To simplify the computation, we may introduce a logarithmic transform formula_32, leading to the form of GBM:

:formula_33

Then the equivalent Fokker-Planck equation for the evolution of the PDF becomes:

:formula_34

Define formula_35 and formula_36. By introducing the new variables formula_37 and formula_38, the derivatives in the Fokker-Planck equation may be transformed as:

:formula_39

Leading to the new form of the Fokker-Planck equation:

:formula_40

However, this is the canonical form of the heat equation. which has the solution given by the heat kernel:

:formula_41

Plugging in the original variables leads to the PDF for GBM:

:formula_42

When deriving further properties of GBM, use can be made of the SDE of which GBM is the solution, or the explicit solution given above can be used. For example, consider the stochastic process log(&quot;S&quot;&quot;t&quot;). This is an interesting process, because in the Black–Scholes model it is related to the log return of the stock price. Using Itô&#x27;s lemma with &quot;f&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) = log(&quot;S&quot;) gives
:formula_43
It follows that formula_44.

This result can also be derived by applying the logarithm to the explicit solution of GBM:
:formula_45
Taking the expectation yields the same result as above: formula_46.

==Simulating sample paths==

# Python code for the plot

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

mu = 1
n = 50
dt = 0.1
x0 = 100
np.random.seed(1)

sigma = np.arange(0.8, 2, 0.2)

x = np.exp(
 (mu - sigma ** 2 / 2) * dt
 + sigma * np.random.normal(0, np.sqrt(dt), size=(len(sigma), n)).T
x = np.vstack([np.ones(len(sigma)), x])
x = x0 * x.cumprod(axis=0)

plt.plot(x)
plt.legend(np.round(sigma, 2))
plt.xlabel(&quot;$t$&quot;)
plt.ylabel(&quot;$x$&quot;)
plt.title(
 &quot;Realizations of Geometric Brownian Motion with different variances\n $\mu=1$&quot;
plt.show()
==Multivariate version==

GBM can be extended to the case where there are multiple correlated price paths.

Each price path follows the underlying process

:formula_47

where the Wiener processes are correlated such that formula_48 where formula_49.

For the multivariate case, this implies that
:formula_50

A multivariate formulation that maintains the driving Brownian motions formula_51 independent is 

:formula_52

where the correlation between formula_53 and formula_54 is now expressed through the formula_55 terms.

==Use in finance==

Geometric Brownian motion is used to model stock prices in the Black–Scholes model and is the most widely used model of stock price behavior.

Some of the arguments for using GBM to model stock prices are:
*The expected returns of GBM are independent of the value of the process (stock price), which agrees with what we would expect in reality.
*A GBM process only assumes positive values, just like real stock prices.
*A GBM process shows the same kind of &#x27;roughness&#x27; in its paths as we see in real stock prices.
*Calculations with GBM processes are relatively easy.

However, GBM is not a completely realistic model, in particular it falls short of reality in the following points:
*In real stock prices, volatility changes over time (possibly stochastically), but in GBM, volatility is assumed constant.
*In real life, stock prices often show jumps caused by unpredictable events or news, but in GBM, the path is continuous (no discontinuity).

Apart from modeling stock prices, Geometric Brownian motion has also found applications in the monitoring of trading strategies.

==Extensions==
In an attempt to make GBM more realistic as a model for stock prices, also in relation to the volatility smile problem, one can drop the assumption that the volatility (formula_56) is constant. If we assume that the volatility is a deterministic function of the stock price and time, this is called a local volatility model. A straightforward extension of the Black Scholes GBM is a local volatility SDE whose distribution is a mixture of distributions of GBM, the lognormal mixture dynamics, resulting in a convex combination of Black Scholes prices for options. If instead we assume that the volatility has a randomness of its own—often described by a different equation driven by a different Brownian Motion—the model is called a stochastic volatility model, see for example the Heston model.

Poortman studied at the universities of Hamburg, Geneva, the Sorbonne in Paris and at Vienna. From 1932 to 1938 he was member of the Council of the Dutch Society for Psychical Research. From 1958 to 1966 he was a Professor of metaphysics at the University of Leiden. After he retired his chair was successively occupied by Prof. Dubbink, Prof. van Vledder and Prof. Gerding.

Poortman was the maker of the Repertory of Dutch philosophers, Repertorium der Nederlandse Wijsbegeerte, which can be consulted on line at the site of the Leiden University.

He formulated the idea of a &quot;hylic pluralism&quot; (in Dutch &quot;hylisch pluralisme&quot;) of the plurality of matter, a model of the universe in which science and metaphysics are no longer contradictory. This vision was explained in his four volume work, &quot;Vehicles of Consciousness&quot;.

==Poortmans categories==

Poortman distinguished six different metaphysical views of the world, which he named from &quot;Alpha&quot; to &quot;Zeta&quot;.

# &quot;Alpha&quot;: monistic materialism, the view that only one kind of stuff, i.e. matter, ultimately exists in this universe.
# &quot;Beta&quot;: the view that only matter exists, but that there are different kinds of matter (hylic pluralism), specifically that God and other spiritual beings are created of a &quot;finer&quot; kind of matter, not visible to our scientific instruments.
# &quot;Gamma&quot;: that only matter exists, with the exception of one single entity which is not material. This entity may be God, Brahman, etc. This is the view held by Poortman himself.
# &quot;Delta&quot;: the view that two separate kinds of material and one kind of spiritual, immaterial entity exists, for example the early Christian and Gnostic belief that man was made of body, soul and spirit, where the first two are different forms of matter and the spirit is immaterial.
#&quot;Epsilon&quot;: a view in which matter and mind are totally separate things. This view was for example held by René Descartes in his &quot;cogito ergo sum&quot; statement, see mind dualism.
#&quot;Zeta&quot;: monistic idealism or illusionism, where matter is seen as some kind of emanation of God or another spiritual being. Especially this classification applies to the Brahman of the Hinduism.

<doc id="203542" wikidata="Q1374428" url="?curid=203542" title="List of symphonies by Joseph Haydn">
<text>There are 106 symphonies by the classical composer Joseph Haydn (1732–1809). Of these, 104 have numbers associated with them which were originally assigned by Eusebius Mandyczewski in 1908 in the chronological order that was known at the time. In the subsequent decades, numerous inaccuracies in the chronology (especially in the lower numbers) were found, but the Mandyczewski numbers were so widely used that when Anthony van Hoboken compiled his catalogue of Haydn&#x27;s works, he incorporated the Mandyczewski number into Catalogue I (e.g., Symphony No. 34 is listed as Hob. I/34). Also in that time period, two additional symphonies were discovered (which were assigned non-Mandyczewskian letters &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;), bringing the total to 106.

* Hob. I/107 in B major, often known not by a number but as &quot;Symphony A&quot; (between 1757 and 1760); arranged as string quartet op. 1, no. 5 Hob. III/5
* Hob. I/108 in B major, often known not by a number but as &quot;Symphony B&quot; (between 1757 and 1760)

Despite this, the number of &quot;symphonies&quot; by Haydn is usually given as 106.

==Extensive and complete recordings==
Several conductors recorded incomplete runs of the symphonies on LP, including two, Hermann Scherchen and Max Goberman, whose efforts have been reissued in all or part on CD. During the 1960&#x27;s, Leslie Jones conducted some fifty of Haydn&#x27;s symphonies together with The Little Orchestra of London. Although not using period instruments, Jones may have been one of the first conductors to use small scale forces. From the mid-1970s to early 1990s, Neville Marriner recorded the &quot;name&quot; symphonies (29 symphonies) with the Academy of St Martin in the Fields for Philips Classics. These include Nos. 6-8, 22, 26, 31, 43-45, 47-49, 53, 55, 59-60, 63, 69, 73, 82-83, 85, 92, 94, 96, 100-101, 103-104. They were originally released separately, then as a box set. Four conductors have recorded the complete symphonies of Joseph Haydn:

* Ernst Märzendorfer recorded a complete set with the Vienna Chamber Orchestra, but it was little known at the time due to limited US-only distribution.
* The first to make a complete recording that was widely available was the Hungarian-American conductor Antal Doráti, with the Philharmonia Hungarica for Decca during the 1970&#x27;s, issued first on LP and subsequently on CD.
* Hungarian conductor Ádám Fischer recorded a complete CD cycle between 1987 and 2001 with the Austro-Hungarian Haydn Orchestra.
* In 2009, American conductor Dennis Russell Davies completed a cycle with the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra for Sony Classical.

Christopher Hogwood was to have recorded on period instruments a complete cycle of Haydn symphonies with the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) for Decca&#x27;s L&#x27;Oiseau Lyre imprint in a total of 15 volumes, each containing 3 CDs. Between 1990 and 2000, a total of 10 of these volumes were commercially released on CD; these volumes contain Nos. 1–75, plus the two early symphonies numbered 107 and 108, and are presented in a theoretical chronological rather than numerical order. The program booklets contained in each of these 10 volumes keep a concordance to the complete contents of the 15 volumes. Prior to the commencement of this project, Hogwood and the AAM had recorded four of Haydn&#x27;s later symphonies (94, 96, 100, and 104) for L&#x27;Oiseau Lyre, which were released first on LP and later on CD. The last five of the 15-volume series were never released, although at least Nos. 76 and 77 were recorded and had a limited release on CD through &quot;BBC Music Magazine&quot;.

Between 1980 and 1986, the violinist Derek Solomons recorded on period instruments 49 symphonies with L&#x27;Estro Armonico for CBS Masterworks. These include Nos. 1-5, 10-11, 15-20, 26-27, 32-33, 35, 37-39, 41-52, 54-60, 63-69, 107-108.

Between 1989 and 1990, Trevor Pinnock recorded on period instruments the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; symphonies (19 symphonies) with The English Concert for Deutsche Grammophon&#x27;s Archiv Produktion. These include Nos. 26, 35, 38-39, 41-52, 58-59, 65. In 1987, Pinnock had already recorded Nos. 6-8.

Also, in 1990, another attempt at a complete Haydn cycle on period instruments began with the Hanover Band led from the keyboard by Roy Goodman for Hyperion Records. Unfortunately, after releasing 57 symphonies on 17 CDs, this project ran out of funds in 1994.

There are two active attempts to record the complete cycle on period instruments. As of early 2015, Thomas Fey has passed the halfway point of recording all the symphonies – 57 plus the Sinfonia Concertante in 22 volumes so far – with the Heidelberger Sinfoniker (one volume with the Schlierbacher Kammerorchester) for Hänssler. The first volumes were released in 2000. In 2014, Giovanni Antonini commenced a cycle for Alpha Records with Il Giardino Armonico (Vols. 1–4) and Kammerorchester Basel (Vols. 5 &amp; 6, to date), aiming to perform and record all of Haydn&#x27;s symphonies by 2032 (the 300th anniversary of the composer&#x27;s birth).

Conductor Michael Fendre has developed a website which contains for all symphonies, whenever available, links to the recordings by Antal Doráti, Ádám Fischer and Christopher Hogwood. The site also contains facts, analyses and a score of each symphony.

<text>The nuthatches () constitute a genus, Sitta, of small passerine birds belonging to the family Sittidae. Characterised by large heads, short tails, and powerful bills and feet, nuthatches advertise their territory using loud, simple songs. Most species exhibit grey or bluish upper parts and a black eye stripe.

Most nuthatches breed in the temperate or montane woodlands of the Northern Hemisphere, although two species have adapted to rocky habitats in the warmer and drier regions of Eurasia. However, the greatest diversity is in Southern Asia, and similarities between the species have made it difficult to identify distinct species. All members of this genus nest in holes or crevices. Most species are non-migratory and live in their habitat year-round, although the North American red-breasted nuthatch migrates to warmer regions during the winter. A few nuthatch species have restricted ranges and face threats from deforestation.

Nuthatches are omnivorous, eating mostly insects, nuts, and seeds. They forage for insects hidden in or under bark by climbing along tree trunks and branches, sometimes upside-down. They forage within their territories when breeding, but they may join mixed feeding flocks at other times. 

Their habit of wedging a large food item in a crevice and then hacking at it with their strong bills gives this group its English name.

==Taxonomy==

The nuthatch family, Sittidae, was described by René-Primevère Lesson in 1828. 

Sometimes the wallcreeper (&quot;Tichodroma muraria&quot;), which is restricted to the mountains of southern Eurasia, is placed in the same family as the nuthatches, but in a separate subfamily &quot;Tichodromadinae&quot;, in which case the nuthatches are classified in the subfamily &quot;Sittinae&quot;. However, the wallcreeper is more often placed in a separate family, the Tichodromadidae. 

The wallcreeper is intermediate in its morphology between the nuthatches and the treecreepers, but its appearance, the texture of its plumage, and the shape and pattern of its tail suggest that it is closer to the former taxon. 

The nuthatch vanga of Madagascar (formerly known as the coral-billed nuthatch) and the sittellas from Australia and New Guinea were once placed in the nuthatch family because of similarities in appearance and lifestyle, but they are not closely related. The resemblances arose via convergent evolution to fill an ecological niche.
The nuthatches&#x27; closest relatives, other than the wallcreeper, are the treecreepers, and the two (or three) families are sometimes placed in a larger grouping with the wrens and gnatcatchers. This superfamily, the Certhioidea, is proposed on phylogenetic studies using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, and was created to cover a clade of (four or) five families removed from a larger grouping of passerine birds, the Sylvioidea.

===Genus name===
The nuthatches are all in the genus &quot;Sitta&quot; Linnaeus, 1758, a name derived from : , Ancient Greek for this bird. 

The English term &quot;nuthatch&quot; refers to the propensity of some species to wedge a large insect or seed in a crack and hack at it with their strong bills.

===Species boundaries===
Species boundaries in the nuthatches are difficult to define. The red-breasted nuthatch, Corsican nuthatch and Chinese nuthatch have breeding ranges separated by thousands of kilometres, but are similar in habitat preference, appearance and song. They were formerly considered to be one species, but are now normally split into three and comprise a superspecies along with the Krüper&#x27;s and Algerian nuthatch. Unusually for nuthatches, all five species excavate their own nests.

The Eurasian, chestnut-vented, Kashmir and chestnut-bellied nuthatches form another superspecies and replace each other geographically across Asia. They are currently considered to be four separate species, but the south Asian forms were once believed to be a subspecies of the Eurasian nuthatch. A recent change in this taxonomy is a split of the chestnut-bellied nuthatch into three species, namely the Indian nuthatch, &quot;Sitta castanea&quot;, found south of the Ganges, the Burmese nuthatch, &quot;Sitta neglecta&quot;, found in southeast Asia, and the chestnut-bellied nuthatch &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, &quot;S. cinnamoventris&quot;, which occurs in the Himalayas. Mitochondrial DNA studies have demonstrated that the white-breasted northern subspecies of Eurasian nuthatch, &quot;S. (europea) arctica&quot;, is distinctive, and also a possible candidate for full species status. This split has been accepted by the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union.

A 2006 review of Asian nuthatches suggested that there are still unresolved problems in nuthatch taxonomy and proposed splitting the genus &quot;Sitta&quot;. This suggestion would move the red- and yellow-billed south Asian species (velvet-fronted, yellow-billed and sulphur-billed nuthatches) to a new genus, create a third genus for the blue nuthatch, and possibly a fourth for the beautiful nuthatch.

The fossil record for this group appears to be restricted to a foot bone of an early Miocene bird from Bavaria which has been identified as an extinct representative of the climbing Certhioidea, a clade comprising the treecreepers, wallcreeper and nuthatches. It has been described as &quot;Certhiops rummeli&quot;. Two fossil species have been described in the genus &quot;Sitta&quot;: &quot;S. cuvieri&quot; Gervais, 1852 and &quot;S. senogalliensis&quot; Portis, 1888, but they probably do not belong to nuthatches.

==Description==

Nuthatches are compact birds with short legs, compressed wings, and square 12-feathered tails. They have long, sturdy, pointed bills and strong toes with long claws. Nuthatches have blue-grey backs (violet-blue in some Asian species, which also have red or yellow bills) and white underparts, which are variably tinted with buff, orange, rufous or lilac. Although head markings vary between species, a long black eye stripe, with contrasting white supercilium, dark forehead and blackish cap is common. The sexes look similar, but may differ in underpart colouration, especially on the rear flanks and under the tail. Juveniles and first-year birds can be almost indistinguishable from adults.

The sizes of nuthatches vary, from the large giant nuthatch, at and , to the small brown-headed nuthatch and the pygmy nuthatch, both around in length and about .

Nuthatches are very vocal, using an assortment of whistles, trills and calls. Their breeding songs tend to be simple and often identical to their contact calls but longer in duration. The red-breasted nuthatch, which coexists with the black-capped chickadee throughout much of its range, is able to understand the latter species&#x27; calls. The chickadee has subtle call variations that communicate information about the size and risk of potential predators. Many birds recognise the simple alarm calls produced by other species, but the red-breasted nuthatch is able to interpret the chickadees&#x27; detailed variations and to respond appropriately.

==Species==
The species diversity for Sittidae is greatest in southern Asia (possibly the original home of this family), where about 15 species occur, but it has representatives across much of the Northern Hemisphere. The currently recognised nuthatch species are tabulated below.
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==

Members of the nuthatch family live in most of North America and Europe and throughout Asia down to the Wallace Line. Nuthatches are sparsely represented in Africa; one species lives in a small area of northeastern Algeria and a population of the Eurasian nuthatch subspecies, &quot;S. e. hispaniensis&quot;, lives in the mountains of Morocco. Most species are resident year-round. The only significant migrant is the red-breasted nuthatch, which winters widely across North America, deserting the northernmost parts of its breeding range in Canada; it has been recorded as a vagrant in Bermuda, Iceland and England.

Most nuthatches are woodland birds and the majority are found in coniferous or other evergreen forests, although each species has a preference for a particular tree type. The strength of the association varies from the Corsican nuthatch, which is closely linked with Corsican pine, to the catholic habitat of the Eurasian nuthatch, which prefers deciduous or mixed woods but breeds in coniferous forests in the north of its extensive range. However, the two species of rock nuthatches are not strongly tied to woodlands: they breed on rocky slopes or cliffs, although both move into wooded areas when not breeding. In parts of Asia where several species occur in the same geographic region, there is often an altitudinal separation in their preferred habitats.

Nuthatches prefer a fairly temperate climate; northern species live near sea level whereas those further south are found in cooler highland habitats. Eurasian and red-breasted nuthatches are lowland birds in the north of their extensive ranges, but breed in the mountains further south; for example, the Eurasian nuthatch, which breeds where the July temperature range is , is found near sea level in Northern Europe, but between altitude in Morocco. The velvet-fronted nuthatch is the sole member of the family which prefers tropical lowland forests.

==Behaviour==

===Nesting, breeding and survival===
All nuthatches nest in cavities; except for the two species of rock nuthatches, all use tree holes, making a simple cup lined with soft materials on which to rest eggs. In some species the lining consists of small woody objects such as bark flakes and seed husks, while in others it includes the moss, grass, hair and feathers typical of passerine birds.

Members of the red-breasted nuthatch superspecies excavate their own tree holes, although most other nuthatches use natural holes or old woodpecker nests. Several species reduce the size of the entrance hole and seal up cracks with mud. The red-breasted nuthatch makes the nest secure by daubing sticky conifer resin globules around the entrance, the male applying the resin outside and the female inside. The resin may deter predators or competitors (the resident birds avoid the resin by diving straight through the entrance hole). The white-breasted nuthatch smears blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and it has been suggested that the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities.

The western rock nuthatch builds an elaborate flask-shaped nest from mud, dung and hair or feathers, and decorates the nest&#x27;s exterior and nearby crevices with feathers and insect wings. The nests are located in rock crevices, in caves, under cliff overhangs or on buildings. The eastern rock nuthatch builds a similar but less complex structure across the entrance to a cavity. Its nest can be quite small but may weigh up to 32 kg (70 lb). This species will also nest in river banks or tree holes and will enlarge its nest hole if it the cavity is too small.
Nuthatches are monogamous. The female produces eggs that are white with red or yellow markings; the clutch size varies, tending to be larger for northern species. The eggs are incubated for 12 to 18 days by the female alone, or by both parents, depending on the species. The altricial (naked and helpless) chicks take between 21 and 27 days to fledge. Both parents feed the young, and in the case of two American species, brown-headed and pygmy, helper males from the previous brood may assist the parents in feeding.

For the few species on which data are available, the average nuthatch lifespan in the wild is between 2 and 3.5 years, although ages of up to 10 years have been recorded. The Eurasian nuthatch has an adult annual survival rate of 53% and the male Corsican nuthatch 61.6%. Nuthatches and other small woodland birds share the same predators: accipiters, owls, squirrels and woodpeckers. An American study showed that nuthatch responses to predators may be linked to reproductive strategies. It measured the willingness of males of two species to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, or a house wren, which destroys eggs. The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the red-breasted nuthatch, but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk. This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of their larger broods.

Cold can be a problem for small birds that do not migrate. Communal roosting in tight huddles can help conserve heat and several nuthatch species employ it—up to 170 pygmy nuthatches have been seen in a single roost. The pygmy nuthatch is able to lower its body temperature when roosting, conserving energy through hypothermia and a lowered metabolic rate.

===Feeding===

Nuthatches forage along tree trunks and branches and are members of the same feeding guild as woodpeckers. Unlike woodpeckers and treecreepers, however, they do not use their tails for additional support, relying instead on their strong legs and feet to progress in jerky hops. They are able to descend head-first and hang upside-down beneath twigs and branches. Krüper&#x27;s nuthatch can even stretch downward from an upside-down position to drink water from leaves without touching the ground. Rock nuthatches forage with a similar technique to the woodland species, but seek food on rock faces and sometimes buildings. When breeding, a pair of nuthatches will only feed within their territory, but at other times will associate with passing tits or join mixed-species feeding flocks.

Insects and other invertebrates are a major portion of the nuthatch diet, especially during the breeding season, when they rely almost exclusively on live prey, but most species also eat seeds during the winter, when invertebrates are less readily available. Larger food items, such as big insects, snails, acorns or seeds may be wedged into cracks and pounded with the bird&#x27;s strong bill. Unusually for a bird, the brown-headed nuthatch uses a piece of tree bark as a lever to pry up other bark flakes to look for food; the bark tool may then be carried from tree to tree or used to cover a seed cache.

All nuthatches appear to store food, especially seeds, in tree crevices, in the ground, under small stones, or behind bark flakes, and these caches are remembered for as long as 30 days. Similarly, the rock nuthatches wedge snails into suitable crevices for consumption in times of need. European nuthatches have been found to avoid using their caches during benign conditions in order to save them for harsher times.

==Conservation status==

Some nuthatches, such as the Eurasian nuthatch and the North American species, have extensive ranges and large populations, and few conservation problems, although locally they may be affected by woodland fragmentation. In contrast, some of the more restricted species face severe pressures.

The endangered white-browed nuthatch is found only in the Mount Victoria area of Burma, where forest up to above sea level has been almost totally cleared and habitat between is heavily degraded. Nearly 12,000 people live in the Natma Taung national park which includes Mount Victoria, and their fires and traps add to the pressure on the nuthatch. The population of the white-browed nuthatch, estimated at only a few thousand, is decreasing, and no conservation measures are in place. The Algerian nuthatch is found in only four areas of Algeria, and it is possible that the total population does not exceed 1,000 birds. Fire, erosion, and grazing and disturbance by livestock have reduced the quality of the habitat, despite its location in the Taza National Park.

Deforestation has also caused population declines for the vulnerable Yunnan and yellow-billed nuthatches. The Yunnan nuthatch can cope with some tree loss, since it prefers open pine woodland, but although still locally common, it has disappeared from several of the areas in which it was recorded in the early 20th century. The threat to yellow-billed is particularly acute on Hainan, where more than 70% of the woodland has been lost in the past 50 years due to shifting cultivation and the use of wood for fuel during Chinese government re-settlement programmes.

Krüper&#x27;s nuthatch is threatened by urbanisation and development in and around mature coniferous forests, particularly in the Mediterranean coastal areas where the species was once numerous. A law promoting tourism came into force in Turkey in 2003, further exacerbating the threats to their habitat. The law reduced bureaucracy and made it easier for developers to build tourism facilities and summer houses in the coastal zone where woodland loss is a growing problem for the nuthatch.

<doc id="203546" wikidata="Q145609" url="?curid=203546" title="Anne Hyde">
<text>Anne Hyde (12 March 1637 – 31 March 1671) was the first wife of James, Duke of York, who later became King James II and VII.

Anne was the daughter of a member of the English gentry—Edward Hyde (later created Earl of Clarendon)—and met her future husband when they were both living in exile in the Netherlands. She married James in 1660 and two months later gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first child, who had been conceived out of wedlock. Some observers disapproved of the marriage, but James&#x27;s brother, King Charles II of England, wanted the marriage to take place. Another cause of disapproval was the public affection James showed toward Anne. They had eight children, of whom six died in early childhood; the two who reached adulthood were future monarchs, Mary II and Anne. James was a known philanderer who kept many mistresses, for which Anne often reproached him, and he fathered many illegitimate children.

Originally an Anglican, Anne converted to Catholicism soon after her marriage to James. She had been exposed to Catholicism during visits to the Netherlands and France and was strongly attracted thereto. Partly due to Anne&#x27;s influence, James also converted to Catholicism, which ultimately led to the Glorious Revolution. She developed advanced breast cancer and died shortly after giving birth to her eighth child.

== Early years (1637–1660) ==

In 1629, Edward Hyde married his first wife, Anne Ayliffe of Grittenham. Six months into the marriage, Anne caught smallpox, miscarried and died. Three years later, Hyde married Frances Aylesbury. The couple&#x27;s eldest daughter was born at Cranbourne Lodge in Windsor in 1637. The parents named her Anne after Edward Hyde&#x27;s first wife. Almost nothing is known of her life before 1649, when her family fled to the Netherlands after the execution of the deposed King Charles I.

During the First English Civil War, her father was a leading advisor to Charles I, then went into exile with his son Charles II in 1646. Like many refugees, they settled in Breda, where Mary of Orange offered shelter to many English fugitives. Mary appointed Anne a maid of honour, apparently against the wishes of her mother Henrietta Maria, who loathed Hyde.

Anne became a general favourite with the people she met either at The Hague or at the Princess of Orange&#x27;s country house at Teylingen. She was attractive and stylish, and she attracted many men. One of the first men to fall in love with Anne was Spencer Compton, a son of the Earl of Northampton. However, Anne quickly fell in love with Henry Jermyn, who returned her feelings. Anne dismissed Jermyn just as quickly when she met James, Duke of York, the son of the deposed king. On 24 November 1659, two or three years after she first met him, James promised he would marry Anne, despite the opposition of many, including her father, who confined her to a room and allegedly urged Charles to execute her. Charles rejected this advice, suggesting Anne&#x27;s strong character would be a positive influence on his weak-willed brother.

==Duchess of York (1660–1671)==

=== Marriage ===
After Anne became visibly pregnant in 1660, the couple were obliged to marry. Following the Restoration of the monarchy in May 1660, they held an official but private marriage ceremony in London on 3 September 1660. The wedding took place between 11 at night and 2 in the morning at Worcester House—her father&#x27;s house in the Strand—and was solemnised by Dr. Joseph Crowther, James&#x27;s chaplain. The French Ambassador described Anne as having &quot;courage, cleverness, and energy almost worthy of a King&#x27;s blood&quot;.

The couple&#x27;s first child, Charles, was born in October of that year, but died seven months later. Seven children followed: Mary (1662–1694), James (1663–1667), Anne (1665–1714), Charles (1666–1667), Edgar (1667–1671), Henrietta (1669–1669) and Catherine (1671–1671). All of their sons and two of their daughters died in infancy.

Even well after their marriage, some observers disapproved of the prince&#x27;s decision, regardless of what he had promised beforehand. Samuel Pepys said of the marriage: &quot;... that the Duke of York&#x27;s marriage with her hath undone the kingdom, by making the Chancellor so great above reach, who otherwise would have been but an ordinary man, to have been dealt with by other people ...&quot; After Anne&#x27;s death, the royal court tried to find a new wife for James, but this new wife was not, under any circumstances, to be of humble birth. As good a father as Pepys portrayed James to be, he strangely stated that Anne and James were unaffected by the death of their firstborn son. Pepys also described Anne as &quot;not only the proudest woman in the world, but the most expensefull.&quot; Even in the minds of James&#x27;s nephew (later to become Anne&#x27;s son-in-law), William III of Orange, and that of her husband&#x27;s cousin, Sophia of Hanover, the stigma of the Hydes&#x27; lowly birth remained.

=== Domestic life ===
Anne was not popular at court, although she was well liked by her brother-in-law. Regarded as &quot;the most unguarded ogler of his time&quot;, James had a succession of mistresses throughout their marriage. These mistresses included Arabella Churchill, mother of his illegitimate son, the Duke of Berwick. Berwick had a highly successful career in the French army, while James secured a series of positions for Arabella&#x27;s brother, John Churchill.

Anne was not oblivious to her husband&#x27;s infidelities, Pepys recording that she was jealous and chided James. Pepys also claimed, however, that the pair were notorious for showing their affections publicly, kissing and leaning on each other. In another entry, Pepys wrote that when James fell in love with Lady Chesterfield, Anne complained to Charles so insistently that Lady Chesterfield had to retreat to the countryside, where she remained until she died. 

Historian John Callow claims Anne &quot;made the greatest single impact&quot; in the process that led to James becoming a Catholic. Raised in the Anglican high church tradition which was closely linked to the forms and practices of Catholicism, Anne stopped attending Anglican service in 1669. James converted around the same time, but at Charles&#x27; request delayed the announcement of his conversion until 1673. Although he later converted to Catholicism on his deathbed, Charles insisted for political reasons that his brother&#x27;s children must be raised as Protestants, so both Mary and Anne were members of the Church of England.

== Death and legacy ==

Anne was ill for 15 months after the birth of her youngest son, Edgar. She bore Henrietta in 1669 and Catherine in 1671, never recovering from Catherine&#x27;s birth. Ill with breast cancer, she died on 31 March 1671. On her deathbed, her brothers Henry and Laurence tried to bring an Anglican priest to give her communion, but Anne refused and she received &quot;viaticum&quot; of the Catholic Church. Two days after her death, her embalmed body was interred in the vault of Mary, Queen of Scots, at Westminster Abbey&#x27;s Henry VII Chapel. In June 1671, Anne&#x27;s only surviving son Edgar died of natural causes, followed by Catherine in December, leaving Mary and Anne as the Duke of York&#x27;s heirs.

After Anne Hyde&#x27;s death, a portrait of her painted by Willem Wissing was commissioned by the future Mary II; this used to hang above the door of the Queen&#x27;s Drawing Room of the Garden House at Windsor Castle. Two years after the death of his first wife, James married a Catholic princess, Mary of Modena. Mary bore James Francis Edward, James&#x27;s only son to survive to adulthood. James became king of England, Ireland and Scotland in 1685, but was deposed during the Glorious Revolution of 1688. The throne was then offered by the Parliament of England to Anne&#x27;s eldest daughter Mary and her husband William III of Orange. After Mary died in 1694 and William in 1702, Anne Hyde&#x27;s only surviving child Anne became queen of the three kingdoms and, in 1707, the first sovereign of the united Kingdom of Great Britain.

<doc id="203547" wikidata="Q246026" url="?curid=203547" title="Patrick Anson, 5th Earl of Lichfield">
<text>Thomas Patrick John Anson, 5th Earl of Lichfield (25 April 1939 – 11 November 2005), was an English photographer from the Anson family. He inherited the Earldom of Lichfield in 1960 from his paternal grandfather. In his professional practice he was known as Patrick Lichfield.

== Biography ==

Thomas Patrick John Anson was born on 25 April 1939. He was the only son of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas William Arnold Anson, Viscount Anson (1913–1958), the eldest son and heir apparent of Thomas Edward Anson, 4th Earl of Lichfield (1883–1960). His mother was born Anne Bowes-Lyon (1917–1980), a niece of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. His parents divorced in 1948, and his mother subsequently became Princess Anne of Denmark after her remarriage to Prince Georg of Denmark in 1950. He had one sister, Lady Elizabeth Georgiana Anson (1941–2020), who married Sir Geoffrey Adam Shakerley, 6th Baronet.

Lichfield was educated at two boarding independent schools: Wellesley House School in the coastal town of Broadstairs in Kent, and Harrow School in Harrow on the Hill in north-west London, followed by the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

His father died in 1958, leaving Patrick to succeed as 5th Earl of Lichfield when his grandfather died in 1960.
Lichfield joined the Grenadier Guards in 1959. On leaving the Army in 1962, he began to work as a photographer&#x27;s assistant, and built up his own reputation, partly as a result of having access to the Royal Family. He was selected to take the official photographs of the wedding of the Prince and Princess of Wales in 1981, and subsequently became one of the UK&#x27;s best-known photographers. From 1999 onwards he was a pioneer of digital photography as a professional standard. He was chosen by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh to take official pictures of her Golden Jubilee in 2002.

In 2003, he made a cameo appearance in the BBC medical drama series &quot;Casualty&quot; for a story about raising money for Children in Need. He also cameoed in the British sitcom &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;, appearing in the episode &quot;Sea Fever&quot; as a passenger on the &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;.

Lichfield resided in an apartment at the former family seat of Shugborough Hall, near Cannock Chase in Staffordshire. In 1960 he had given the estate to the National Trust in lieu of death duties arising on his grandfather&#x27;s death.

==Marriage and children==

On 8 March 1975 Lichfield married Lady Leonora Grosvenor, elder daughter of Robert Grosvenor, 5th Duke of Westminster and Hon. Viola Lyttelton. They were divorced in 1986. The Countess of Lichfield has not remarried and has retained her title. She and the Earl had one son and two daughters together:

* Lady Rose Meriel Margaret Anson (born 27 July 1976), a goddaughter of Princess Margaret
* Thomas William Robert Hugh Anson, 6th Earl of Lichfield (born 19 July 1978); he married Lady Henrietta Conyngham, daughter of Henry Conyngham, 8th Marquess Conyngham, in December 2009. They have two sons.
* Lady Eloise Anne Elizabeth Anson (born 1981); she married Louis Alexander Philip Waymouth on 7 September 2013. They have two children.

Lichfield&#x27;s most recent partner was the biographer Lady Annunziata Asquith, daughter of Julian Asquith, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Asquith.

== Death ==

On 10 November 2005, Lichfield suffered a major stroke and died the following day at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. He was 66 years old. His funeral was held on 21 November at St Michael and All Angels Church, Colwich, Staffordshire, where he was buried in the family vault.

Lichfield&#x27;s apartment at Shugborough now houses an exhibition of his work, together with a recreation of his studio.

<doc id="203548" wikidata="Q2978696" url="?curid=203548" title="Clawhammer">
<text>Clawhammer, sometimes called down-picking, overhand, or most commonly known as frailing, is a distinctive banjo playing style and a common component of American old-time music. The style likely descends from that of West African lutes, such as the akonting which are also the direct ancestors of the banjo. 
The principal difference between clawhammer style and other styles is the picking direction. Traditional picking styles (classic banjo), including those for folk, bluegrass, and classical guitar, consist of an up-picking motion by the fingers and a down-picking motion by the thumb; this is also the technique used in the Scruggs style for the banjo. Clawhammer picking, by contrast, is primarily a down-picking style. The hand assumes a claw-like shape and the strumming finger is kept fairly stiff, striking the strings by the motion of the hand at the wrist or elbow, rather than a flicking motion by the finger. In its most common form on the banjo, only the thumb and middle or index finger are used and the finger always downpicks, hitting the string with the back of the fingernail. By contrast, the thumb rests on the fifth string with the downpick motion, and is often released in a lighter up-pick to create the distinctive clawhammer sound. 

This style of down-picking is also the traditional technique used to play the akonting, called o&#x27;teck (literally, &quot;to stroke&quot;). Given that the banjo was the folk instrument of African Americans before its wider spread, the clawhammer would thus be a descendant style of o’teck and related West African techniques. 

Although much traditional clawhammer banjo playing is highly rhythmic, it typically includes elements of melody, harmony, rhythm and percussion. The varied playing styles emphasize these elements to different degrees, sometimes changing the emphasis during the performance of a single tune. The possibilities include sounding individual melodic notes, strumming harmonic chords, strumming and picking to produce rhythmic and percussive effects on the strings, as well as making percussive effects by brushing or thumping the thumb or fingers upon the banjo head or skin. This diverse range of musical sounds and effects gives clawhammer banjo its artistic solo potential in addition to its traditional role as a rhythmic accompaniment to other musicians. In particular, the duo of a fiddler playing melody alongside a driving clawhammer accompanist once served as a basic Appalachian dance band, as recalled by Ralph Stanley in his autobiography, &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;.

==Technique==
A common characteristic of clawhammer patterns is the thumb does not pick on the downbeat, as one might in typical fingerpicking patterns for guitar. For example, this is a common, basic 2/4 pattern:
# A fingerpicked melody quarter note on the downbeat,
# Other strings strummed with the fingers, for a total of roughly an eighth note starting on the upbeat,
# A thumbpicked eighth note, usually on the shorter fifth string, to complete the bar.

Here, the thumb plays the high drone on the second &quot;and&quot; of &quot;one and two &quot;and&quot;&quot;. This combined with the middle finger strumming provides a characteristic &quot;bum-ditty bum-ditty&quot; banjo sound, whether actually played on a banjo or on a guitar.

The fretting hand also comes into play in this approach to playing banjo. The fretting hand can hammer, pull off, slide and bend individual and groups of strings. This can create the illusion that the picking hand is doing something more than down-picking.

== Clawhammer vs. frailing == 
While the terms &quot;clawhammer&quot; and &quot;frailing&quot; can be used interchangeably, some old-time players draw a distinction between the two. Some players further distinguish between &quot;drop-thumb&quot; and &quot;clawhammer.&quot; The term &quot;double-thumbing&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with &quot;drop-thumbing,&quot; though double thumbing refers specifically to striking the fifth string after every beat rather than every other beat, while drop thumbing refers to dropping the thumb from the 5th drone string down to strike a melody note.

Confusing the nomenclature further are the many older traditional terms which include &quot;overhand,&quot; &quot;knockdown&quot;, &quot;hoedown,&quot; &quot;down-picking,&quot; &quot;rapping,&quot; &quot;beating,&quot; &quot;stroke style,&quot; and &quot;clubbing.&quot; This is reflective of the informality of old-time music in general, as each player develops an idiomatic style.

==On guitar==
Although both &quot;clawhammer&quot; and &quot;frailing&quot; are primarily used to refer to banjo styles, the terms do appear with reference to guitar. Jody Stecher was the first guitarist to record in the style, as accompaniment for the song &quot;Red Rocking Chair&quot; on his recording, &quot;A Song that Will Linger&quot;, with Kate Brislin.

Fingerstyle guitarist Steve Baughman distinguishes between frailing and clawhammer as follows. In frailing, the index fingertip is used for up-picking melody, and the middle fingernail is used for rhythmic downward brushing. In clawhammer, only downstrokes are used, and they are typically played with one fingernail as is the usual technique on the banjo.

Alec Stone Sweet describes the clawhammer technique in the liner notes to &quot;Tumblin&#x27; Gap: Clawhammer Guitar Solos&quot;: &quot;There are five characteristics of the way I play clawhammer. First, every specific note played by the right hand is produced either by the index finger or the thumb. Second, no note is ever plucked; each is played either with the thumb, or by striking down on a string with the nail of the index finger. Third, the index finger never plays off the beat, and the thumb never plays on the beat. This feature of clawhammer technique gives the music a heavier – and, to my ear, more natural – drive than it would have if it were played, say, as melody over an alternating bass. There is one exception to this rule: variations on a common clawhammer banjo lick (that you can hear on the climatic high notes of the second part of Polly Put the Kettle On, and the third part of Joke on the Puppy) when the thumb plays on beat. Fourth, for any piece, most of the notes are produced by the left hand, in combinations of slides, hammers, and pull-offs; slurs can occur on or off the beat. Fifth, I play in multiple tunings, and sometimes replace the sixth string bass with a high sixth string treble (of the same gauge employed for the first string). The banjo player will realize that I use my thumb on the bass strings to obtain drones, much as a clawhammer player uses the banjo’s high fifth string; indeed, when I string the guitar with a high treble in place of the sixth-string bass, it is partly to imitate the fifth string of the banjo. In many of the tunes, I keep multiple drones going, on different strings. To sum up, in my version of clawhammer guitar, the thumb plays off the beat, even when it plays harmony bass notes or bass lines; no strings are ever plucked; with respect to the right hand, only the index finger and the thumb sound notes, but never at the same time. What is incredible is how much full textured sound one finger, one thumb, and left hand slurs can generate.&quot;

Players in this down-picking style include Jody Stecher, Barbecue Bob, Ola Belle Reed, Alec Stone Sweet, Steve Baughman, and Michael Stadler.

Another usage of &quot;clawhammer&quot; in guitar circles refers to a style in which the pinky finger or the pinky and ring fingers are used to brace the hand and the index finger, middle finger, and thumb are used to pluck the strings. The index and middle fingers are held in a claw shape and they do resemble the two prongs of a claw hammer, but this is an uncommon and arguably incorrect usage of the term &quot;clawhammer&quot;. See fingerpicking.

==On ukulele==
The clawhammer banjo technique works quite well on a ukulele in the standard GCEA tuning, especially playing in the key of C or the key of G. Since, like the 5-string banjo, there is a string that is higher pitched on the opposite side, the same technique results in the same sound.

<text>USS &quot;Houston&quot; (CL/CA-30), was a of the United States Navy. She was the second Navy ship to bear the name &quot;Houston&quot;.

She was launched by Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company, Newport News, Virginia, on 7 September 1929, sponsored by Elizabeth Holcombe (daughter of Oscar Holcombe, then-mayor of Houston, Texas), and commissioned on 17 June 1930.

The ship was originally classified as a light cruiser (hull number CL-30) because of her thin armor. &quot;Houston&quot; was redesignated a heavy cruiser (CA-30) on 1 July 1931, as the provisions of the 1930 London Naval Treaty considered ships with 8-inch (20.3 cm) main guns to be heavy cruisers.

==Inter-war period==
After conducting a shakedown cruise in the Atlantic, &quot;Houston&quot; returned to the United States in October 1930. She then visited her namesake city, and joined the fleet at Hampton Roads. Steaming to New York, the cruiser departed on 10 January 1931 for the Pacific, and after stopping at the Panama Canal and the Hawaiian Islands, arrived at Manila on 22 February. &quot;Houston&quot; became flagship of the Asiatic Fleet upon arrival, and for the next year participated in training operations in the Far East.

With the outbreak of war between China and Japan in 1931, &quot;Houston&quot; got underway on 31 January for Shanghai to protect American interests. She landed Marine and Navy gun platoons to help stabilize the situation and remained in the area, with the exception of a good will cruise to the Philippines in March and one to Japan in May 1933, until being relieved by on 17 November 1933. The cruiser sailed to San Francisco to join the Scouting Force, and for the years preceding World War II participated in Fleet Problems and maneuvers in the Pacific.
During this period, &quot;Houston&quot; made several special cruises. President Franklin Roosevelt came aboard on 1 July 1934 at Annapolis, Maryland, for a cruise of almost through the Caribbean and to Portland, Oregon, by way of Hawaii. &quot;Houston&quot; also carried Assistant Secretary of the Navy Henry L. Roosevelt on a tour of the Hawaiian Islands, returning to San Diego on 15 May 1935.

After a short cruise in Alaskan waters, the cruiser returned to Seattle and embarked the President again on 3 October for a vacation cruise to Cedros Island, Magdalena Bay, Cocos Island, and Charleston, South Carolina. &quot;Houston&quot; celebrated the opening of the Golden Gate Bridge at San Francisco on 28 May 1937, and carried President Roosevelt for a Fleet Review at the same city on 14 July 1938. Roosevelt then began a 24-day cruise aboard &quot;Houston&quot; to fish the waters of the Galápagos Islands, concluding on 9 August 1938 at Pensacola, Florida.

&quot;Houston&quot; became flagship of the U.S. Fleet on 19 September, when Rear Admiral Claude C. Bloch brought his flag aboard, and maintained that status until 28 December, when she returned to the Scouting Force. Continuing the routine of training exercises, she got underway for Fleet Problem XX, on 4 January 1939 from San Francisco, sailed to Norfolk and Key West, and there embarked the President and the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral William D. Leahy, for the duration of the exercise. She arrived in Houston on 7 April for a brief visit before returning to Seattle, where she arrived on 30 May.

Assigned as flagship of the Hawaiian Detachment, the cruiser arrived in Pearl Harbor after her post-overhaul shakedown on 7 December 1939, and continued in that capacity until returning to Mare Island on 17 February 1940. Sailing to Hawaii, she departed for the Philippine Islands on 3 November. Arriving at Manila on 19 November, she became the flagship of Admiral Thomas C. Hart, Commander Asiatic Fleet.

Shortly before the war in the Pacific broke out, five quad-mount 1.1&quot;/75 caliber antiaircraft cannons were shipped to Cavite Naval Yard in the Philippines; four of these were installed aboard &quot;Houston&quot; to increase the ship&#x27;s air defense protection.

==World War II==
As the war crisis deepened, Admiral Hart deployed his fleet in readiness. On the night of the Pearl Harbor attack, &quot;Houston&quot; got underway from Panay Island with fleet units bound for Darwin, Australia, where she arrived on 28 December 1941 by way of Balikpapan and Surabaya. After patrol duty, she joined the American-British-Dutch-Australian (ABDA) naval force at Surabaya.

===Battle of Makassar Strait===
Air raids were frequent in the area, and &quot;Houston&quot;″s gunners shot down four Japanese planes in the Battle of Bali Sea (also known as the Battle of Makassar Strait) on 4 February 1942, as Admiral Karel Doorman of the Royal Netherlands Navy took his force to engage Japanese reported to be at Balikpapan. &quot;Houston&quot; took one hit, disabling the number three turret, and the cruiser was so damaged that she had to be sent out of the battle area. Doorman was forced to abandon his advance.

===Timor Convoy===

&quot;Houston&quot; arrived at Tjilatjap 5 February and stayed until 10 February, when she left for Darwin to escort a convoy carrying troops to reinforce forces already defending Timor. Escorting , , , and &quot;Tulagi&quot;, &quot;Houston&quot; with the destroyer and sloops and departed Darwin before two in the morning of 15 February for Koepang. By eleven in the morning, the convoy was being shadowed by a Japanese flying boat that dropped some bombs without causing damage before departing. The next morning another shadowing aircraft had taken position, and before noon the convoy was attacked by bombers and flying boats in two waves. During the first attack, &quot;Mauna Loa&quot; suffered slight damage and two casualties, one killed and one wounded. &quot;Houston&quot;″s fire showed no effects. During the second attack, &quot;Houston&quot; distinguished herself with a barrage which made her &quot;like a sheet of flame&quot; shooting down 7 of the 44 planes of the second wave. The convoy continued toward Timor for a few hours, with &quot;Houston&quot; launching a scout plane seeking the enemy position. ABDA suspected the presence of Japanese carriers, an imminent invasion of Timor, and a support fleet lying in wait and thus ordered the convoy back to Darwin, which it reached before noon on 18 February.

&quot;Houston&quot; and &quot;Peary&quot; departed later that day to rejoin combat forces at Tjilatjap. Shortly after departure, &quot;Peary&quot; broke off to chase a suspected submarine, and expended so much fuel in doing so that the destroyer returned to Darwin instead of continuing with &quot;Houston&quot;. &quot;Houston&quot; thus escaped the Japanese attack on Darwin on 19 February, in which &quot;Peary&quot;, &quot;Meigs&quot; and &quot;Mauna Loa&quot; were among the ships sunk and &quot;Portmar&quot; was forced to beach.

===Battle of the Java Sea===
Receiving word that the major Japanese invasion force was approaching Java protected by a formidable surface unit, Admiral Doorman decided to meet and seek to destroy the main convoy. Sailing on 26 February 1942 with the cruisers &quot;Houston&quot;, , , , and ten destroyers, he met the Japanese support force under Admiral Takeo Takagi consisting of four cruisers and 13 destroyers in the late afternoon of 27 February 1942. As Japanese destroyers laid a smokescreen, the cruisers of both fleets opened fire. After one ineffective torpedo attack, the Japanese light cruisers and destroyers launched a second and sank the destroyer . HMS &quot;Exeter&quot; and the destroyer were hit by gunfire, &quot;Electra&quot; sinking shortly after. At 17:30, Admiral Doorman turned south toward the Java coast, not wishing to be diverted from his main purpose of destroying the convoy.

The Allied fleet dodged another torpedo attack and followed the coastline, during which time the destroyer was sunk, either by mine or internal explosion. The destroyer was detached to pick up survivors from &quot;Kortenaer&quot;, and the American destroyers were ordered back to Surabaya as they had fired all their torpedoes. With no destroyer protection, Doorman&#x27;s four remaining ships turned north again in a last attempt to stop the invasion of Java. At 23:00, the cruisers again encountered the Japanese surface group. Sailing on parallel courses, the opposing units opened fire, and the Japanese launched a torpedo attack 30 minutes later. &quot;De Ruyter&quot; and &quot;Java&quot; were caught in a spread of 12 torpedoes, which resulted in their destruction. Before &quot;De Ruyter&quot; sank, Doorman ordered &quot;Houston&quot; and &quot;Perth&quot; to retire to Tanjong Priok.

Two cruisers and three destroyers of the ABDA naval force were sunk, the cruiser &quot;Exeter&quot; had been damaged, and the remaining ships were ordered back to Surabaya and Tanjong Priok.

===Battle of Sunda Strait===

&quot;Houston&quot; and &quot;Perth&quot; reached Tanjong Priok on 28 February, where they attempted to resupply, but were met with fuel shortages and no available ammunition. The two cruisers were ordered to sail to Tjilatjap with Dutch destroyer , but departed at 17:00 without &quot;Evertsen&quot;, which was delayed. The Allies believed that Sunda Strait was free of enemy vessels, with the last intelligence reports indicating that Japanese warships were no closer than , but a large Japanese force had assembled at Bantam Bay. At 23:06, the two cruisers were off St. Nicholas Point when lookouts on &quot;Perth&quot; sighted an unidentified ship; when it was realized that she was a Japanese destroyer, &quot;Perth&quot; engaged. However, as this happened, multiple Japanese warships appeared and surrounded the two Allied ships.

The two cruisers evaded the nine torpedoes launched by the destroyer . According to ABDA post-battle reports, the cruisers then reportedly sank one transport and forced three others to beach, but were blocked from passing through Sunda Strait by a destroyer squadron, and had to contend with the heavy cruisers and in close proximity. At midnight, &quot;Perth&quot; attempted to force a way through the destroyers, but was hit by four torpedoes in the space of a few minutes, then subject to close-range gunfire until sinking at 00:25 on 1 March.

On board &quot;Houston&quot;, shells were in short supply in the forward turrets, so the crew manhandled shells from the disabled number three turret to the forward turrets. &quot;Houston&quot; was struck by a torpedo shortly after midnight, and began to lose . &quot;Houston&quot;″s gunners had scored hits on three different destroyers and sunk a minesweeper, but she was struck by three more torpedoes in quick succession. Captain Albert Rooks was killed by a bursting shell at 00:30, and as the ship came to a stop, Japanese destroyers moved in, machine-gunning the decks and men in the water. A few minutes later, &quot;Houston&quot; rolled over and sank. Of the 1,061 aboard, 368 survived, including 24 of the 74-man Marine Detachment, only to be captured by the Japanese, interned in prison camps, and forced to work on the infamous Burma Railway. Of 368 Navy and Marine Corps personnel taken prisoner, 77 (21%) died in captivity from a combination of starvation, cruel treatment at the hands of Japanese soldiers, and tropical diseases.

===Aftermath===
&quot;Houston&quot;″s fate was not fully known by the world for almost nine months, and the full story of her last fight was not told until the survivors were liberated from prison camps at the end of the war. Before then, on 30 May 1942, 1,000 new recruits for the Navy, known as the Houston Volunteers, were sworn in at a dedication ceremony in downtown Houston, to replace those believed lost on &quot;Houston&quot;. On 12 October 1942 the light cruiser &quot;Vicksburg&quot; (CL-81), then under construction, was renamed &quot;Houston&quot; in honor of the old ship, President Roosevelt declaring:

Captain Rooks received posthumously the Medal of Honor for his actions. Chaplain George S. Rentz, who had surrendered his life jacket to a younger sailor after finding himself in the water, was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross. He was the only Navy Chaplain to be so honored during World War II.

The crew of &quot;Houston&quot; is honored alongside that of &quot;Perth&quot; at the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne, Australia, and in St John&#x27;s Anglican Church, Fremantle.

===The wreck===
The wreck of USS &quot;Houston&quot; has been dived by amateur scuba divers since at least the early 1970s, first on an irregular basis, but by the late 1990s on a more semi-regular basis, with multi-day scuba diving charter-vessel trips being undertaken to specifically dive the wrecks of both &quot;Houston&quot; and HMAS &quot;Perth&quot; which rests nearby, having been sunk in the same battle as &quot;Houston&quot;. There could be no doubt whatsoever which wreck they were diving as the ships bell had been &#x27;unofficially&#x27; raised from &quot;Houston&quot;″s wreck in 1973 (as was &quot;Perth&quot;″s in the late 1960s, and a book written about the &#x27;expedition&#x27; by the salvor, David Burchell), and after passing through several hands over the years, now sits atop a plinth in a park in the city of Houston, Texas, USA (while &quot;Perth&#x27;s&quot; bell is displayed at the Perth Town Hall in Western Australia). In a training evolution conducted as part of the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) 2014 exercise series, U.S. Navy divers, assisted by personnel from the Indonesian Navy, surveyed what they believed to be the wreck of &quot;Houston&quot; in June 2014. The purpose of the mission was to determine the vessel&#x27;s condition and provide real-world training to rescue-and-salvage divers in maneuvering around a sunken ship. The formal report was released in August 2014 and confirmed that the wreck is indeed that of &quot;Houston&quot;. The report also stated that the wreck had suffered illegal salvage over the years, including removal of rivets and a steel plate from the hull. The investigation also recorded active oil seepage from the ship&#x27;s fuel tanks. Another survey of &quot;Houston&quot; occurred in October 2015, with United States Navy and Indonesian Navy divers embarked aboard for a nine-day survey of &quot;Houston&quot; and &quot;Perth&quot; (which had also been subject to unauthorized salvaging). Divers documented the condition of the two shipwrecks, with this data presented to a conference in Jakarta on preserving and preventing the illegal salvage of wartime shipwrecks in the Java Sea.

<text>Materia medica (lit.: &#x27;medical material/substance&#x27;) is a Latin term from the history of pharmacy for the body of collected knowledge about the therapeutic properties of any substance used for healing (i.e., medications). The term derives from the title of a work by the Ancient Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides in the 1st century AD, , &#x27;On medical material&#x27; (Περὶ ὕλης ἰατρικῆς, &quot;Peri hylēs iatrikēs&quot;, in Greek).

The term &quot;materia medica&quot; was used from the period of the Roman Empire until the 20th century, but has now been generally replaced in medical education contexts by the term pharmacology. The term survives in the title of the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;″s &quot;Materia Non Medica&quot; column.

==Ancient civilizations==

===Ancient Egypt===
The earliest known writing about medicine was a 110-page Egyptian papyrus. It was supposedly written by the god Thoth in about 16 BC. The Ebers papyrus is an ancient recipe book dated to approximately 1552 BC. It contains a mixture of magic and medicine with invocations to banish disease and a catalogue of useful plants, minerals, magic amulets and spells. The most famous Egyptian physician was Imhotep, who lived in Memphis around 2500 B.C. Imhotep&#x27;s materia medica consisted of procedures for treating head and torso injuries, tending of wounds, and prevention and curing of infections, as well as advanced principles of hygiene.

===Ancient India===
In India, the Ayurveda is traditional medicine that emphasizes plant-based treatments, hygiene, and balance in the body&#x27;s state of being. Indian materia medica included knowledge of plants, where they grow in all season, methods for storage and shelf life of harvested materials. It also included directions for making juice from vegetables, dried powders from herb, cold infusions and extracts.

===Ancient China===
The earliest Chinese manual of materia medica, the &quot;Shennong Bencao Jing&quot; (&quot;Shennong Emperor&#x27;s Classic of Materia Medica&quot;), was compiled in the 1st century AD during the Han dynasty, attributed to the mythical Shennong. It lists some 365 medicines, of which 252 are herbs. Earlier literature included lists of prescriptions for specific ailments, exemplified by the &quot;Recipes for Fifty-Two Ailments&quot; found in the Mawangdui tomb, which was sealed in 168 BC. Succeeding generations augmented the &quot;Shennong Bencao Jing&quot;, as in the &quot;Yaoxing Lun&quot; (&quot;Treatise on the Nature of Medicinal Herbs&quot;), a 7th-century Tang dynasty treatise on herbal medicine.

== Ancient Greece ==

===Hippocrates===
In Greece, Hippocrates (born 460 BC) was a philosopher later known as the Father of Medicine. He founded a school of medicine that focused on treating the causes of disease rather than its symptoms. Disease was dictated by natural laws and therefore could be treated through close observation of symptoms. His treatises, &quot;Aphorisms&quot; and &quot;Prognostics&quot;, discuss 265 drugs, the importance of diet and external treatments for diseases.

===Theophrastus===
Theophrastus (390–280 BC) was a disciple of Aristotle and a philosopher of natural history, considered by historians as the Father of Botany. He wrote a treatise entitled &quot;Historia Plantarium&quot; about 300 BC. It was the first attempt to organize and classify plants, plant lore, and botanical morphology in Greece. It provided physicians with a rough taxonomy of plants and details of medicinal herbs and herbal concoctions.

===Galen===
Galen was a philosopher, physician, pharmacist and prolific medical writer. He compiled an extensive record of the medical knowledge of his day and added his own observations. He wrote on the structure of organs, but not their uses; the pulse and its association with respiration; the arteries and the movement of blood; and the uses of theriacs. &quot;In treatises such as &quot;On Theriac to Piso&quot;, &quot;On Theriac to Pamphilius&quot;, and &quot;On Antidotes&quot;, Galen identified theriac as a sixty-four-ingredient compound, able to cure any ill known&quot;. His work was rediscovered in the 15th century and became the authority on medicine and healing for the next two centuries. His medicine was based on the regulation of the four humors (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile) and their properties (wet, dry, hot, and cold).

===Dioscorides&#x27;s &quot;De materia medica&quot;===

The Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides, of Anazarbus in Asia Minor, wrote a five-volume treatise concerning medical matters, entitled Περὶ ὕλης ἰατρικῆς in Greek or &quot;De materia medica&quot; in Latin. This famous commentary covered about 600 plants along with therapeutically useful animal and mineral products. It documented the effects of drugs made from these substances on patients. &quot;De materia medica&quot; was the first extensive pharmacopeia, including about a thousand natural product drugs (mostly plant-based), 4,740 medicinal usages for drugs, and 360 medical properties (such as antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, stimulant). The book was heavily translated, and portrayed some of the emblematic actions of physicians and herbalists. One such page is &quot;Physician Preparing an Elixir&quot;.

Dioscorides&#x27; plant descriptions use an elementary classification, though he cannot be said to have used botanical taxonomy. Book one describes the uses for aromatic oils, salves and ointments, trees and shrubs, and fleshy fruits, even if not aromatic. Book two included uses for animals, parts of animals, animal products, cereals, leguminous, malvaceous, cruciferous, and other garden herbs. Book three detailed the properties of roots, juices, herbs and seeds used for food or medicine. Book four continued to describe the uses for roots and herbs, specifically narcotic and poisonous medicinal plants. Book five dealt with the medicinal uses for wine and metallic ores. It is a precursor to all modern pharmacopeias, and is considered one of the most influential herbal books in history. It remained in use until about 1600 AD.

==Medieval==

===Middle Eastern===
Avicenna (980–1037 AD) was a Persian philosopher, physician, and Islamic scholar. He wrote about 40 books on medicine. His two most famous books are &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot; and &quot;The Book of Healing&quot;, used in medieval universities as medical textbooks. He did much to popularize the connection between Greek and Arabic medicine, translating works by Hippocrates, Aristotle and Galen into Arabic. Avicenna stressed the importance of diet, exercise, and hygiene. He also was the first to describe parasitic infection, to use urine for diagnostic purposes and discouraged physicians from the practice of surgery because it was too base and manual.

===European===
In medieval Europe, medicinal herbs and plants were cultivated in monastery and nunnery gardens beginning about the 8th century. Charlemagne gave orders for the collection of medicinal plants to be grown systematically in his royal garden. This royal garden was an important precedent for botanical gardens and physic gardens that were established in the 16th century. It was also the beginning of the study of botany as a separate discipline. In about the 12th century, medicine and pharmacy began to be taught in universities.

Shabbethai Ben Abraham, better known as Shabbethai Donnolo, (913–&quot;c&quot;.982) was a 10th-century Italian Jew and the author of an early Hebrew text, &quot;Antidotarium&quot;. It consisted of detailed drug descriptions, medicinal remedies, practical methods for preparing medicine from roots. It was a veritable glossary of herbs and drugs used during the medieval period. Donnollo was widely travelled and collected information from Arabic, Greek and Roman sources.

In the Early and High Middle Ages Nestorian Christians were banished for their heretical views that they carried to Asia Minor. The Greek text was translated into Syriac when pagan Greek scholars fled east after Constantine’s conquest of Byzantium,
Stephanos (son of Basilios, a Christian living in Baghdad under the Khalif Motawakki) made an Arabic translation of &quot;De Materia Medica&quot; from the Greek in 854. In 948 the Byzantine Emperor Romanus II, son and co-regent of Constantine Porphyrogenitos, sent a beautifully illustrated Greek manuscript of &quot;De materia medica&quot; to the Spanish Khalif, Abd-Arrahman III. In 1250, Syriac scholar Bar Hebraeus prepared an illustrated Syriac version, which was translated into Arabic.

==Early modern==

Matthaeus Silvaticus, Avicenna, Galen, Dioscorides, Platearius and Serapio inspired the appearance of three main works printed in Mainz: In 1484 the &quot;Herbarius&quot;, the following year the &quot;Gart der Gesundheit&quot;, and in 1491 the &quot;Ortus Sanitatis&quot;. The works contain 16, 242 and 570 references to Dioscorides, respectively.

The first appearance of Dioscorides as a printed book was a Latin translation printed at Colle, Italy by Johanemm Allemanun de Mdemblik in 1478. The Greek version appeared in 1499 by Manutius at Venice.

The most useful books of botany, pharmacy and medicine used by students and scholars were supplemented commentaries on Dioscorides, including the works of Fuchs, Anguillara, Mattioli, Maranta, Cesalpino, Dodoens, Fabius Columna, Gaspard and Johann Bauhin, and De Villanueva/Servetus. In several of these versions, the annotations and comments exceed the Dioscoridean text and have much new botany. Printers were not merely printing the authentic materia medica, but hiring experts on the medical and botanical field for criticism, commentaries, that would raise the stature of the printers and the work.

Most of these authors copied each other, from previous works. It was normal to add previous commentaries and marginalia, to make the text look more enriched or thorough.

There were several De Materia Medica works noted as &quot;Anonymous A, B, C and D&quot; by the expert on Dioscorides-De Materia Medica professor John M. Riddle. The &quot;Anonymous A&quot; has to do with authors on translations of handwriting. Riddle proved &quot;Anonymous C&quot; to be Bruyerinus Champier.

During the 16th century, the most representative among them were Ermolao Barbaro, Jean Ruel, Broyeurinus, Michel de Villeneuva, Pietro Andrea Mattioli, Andres Laguna, Marcello Virgilio, Martin Mathee and Valerius Cordus.

In 1789, William Cullen published his two volume &quot;A Treatise of the Materia Medica&quot;, which was highly valued by other medical practitioners throughout Europe.

===Ermolao Barbaro===
The work of the Italian physician and humanist Ermolao Barbaro was published in 1516, 23 years after his death. Poliziano wrote to Ermalao Barbaro, forwarding a manuscript of the 1st-century pharmacologist Pedanius Dioscorides, asking him to send it back &quot;annotated by that very learned hand of yours, thus lending the volume additional value and authority.&quot; Barbaro was professor of the University of Padua in 1477 and translated many texts from Greek to Latin.
He sought to avoid mistakes by gathering as many manuscripts as he could for checking the texts. He claimed to have corrected 5000 mistakes between two editions of Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Naturalis historia&quot;, a work he found very similar to &quot;Materia Medica&quot;, for which he used at least two editions as well.

The result of Barbaro&#x27;s effort occupied no fewer than 58 pages printed in three columns of about 50 entries each. The work provides a key to over 9,000 items; all references were to pages. This was the first annotated Latin translation of Dioscorides&#x27; &quot;Materia Medica&quot;, and so Barbaro became the earliest of the Renaissance translators of Dioscorides, a practice that saw its golden age in the 16th century. Barbaro&#x27;s work was later corrected by Giovanni-Battista.

===Jean Ruel===

Jean Ruel was the dean of the Faculty of Medicine and physician to King Francis I of France. He perfected the Latin translation of the &quot;Materia Medica&quot; directly from the &quot;princeps&quot; edition. He tried to develop a translation joining philology, botany and medicine. This work, printed in 1516 by Henri Estienne/Stephano, became very popular, having 20 editions during the 16th century. He published editions until 1537, printed by Simon de Colines.

From this point, Latin was the preferred language for presenting De Materia Medica, and Ruel&#x27;s editions became the basis from which many other important authors would start to create their own Materia Medica. Ruel was also teacher of two great De Materia Medica authors: Michel de Villeneuve and Andres Laguna.

===Bruyerinus===

Bruyerinus Champier was the nephew of Symphorien Champier, and physician of Henry II of France. He was an Arabist, and translated works of Avicena. In 1550 he published his first Materia Medica, printed by Balthazar Arnoullet in Lyons. This work had a second edition in 1552 printed by Arnoullet in Lyon and Vienne. Both works were illustrated with figures by Fuchs, but in this last edition there were also 30 woodcuts by the botanist and physician Jacob Dalechamp. It seems that the reason that he used his initials, H.B.P., and not his full name in the work; it could be that he practically transcribed commentaries of Mattioli.

===Michael Servetus===

According to Spanish scholar González Echeverría in several communications in the ISHM, the John M. Riddle &quot;Anonymous B&quot; (De Materia Medica of 1543) would be Michael Servetus, and that the &quot;Anonymous D&quot; (De Materia Medica of 1554 of Mattioli plus non-signed commentaries) is two commentarians, Servetus and Mattioi, being the last one hired for editing the &quot;Lyons printers&#x27; Tribute to Michel de Villeneuve&quot; edition.
Michael Servetus, using the name &quot;Michel de Villeneuve&quot;, who already had his first death sentence from the University of Paris, anonymously published a Dioscorides-De Materia Medica in 1543, printed by Jean &amp; Francois Frellon in Lyon. It has 277 marginalia and 20 commentaries on a De Materia Medica of Jean Ruel. According to Gonzalez Echeverría, to be associated to an anonymous Pharmacopeia that &quot;Michel de Villeneuve&quot; published the same year, meant to be a single unit, which is typical when it comes to De Materia Medica-Pharmacopeia. This work had six later editions, in 1546 and 1547 by Jean Frellon, who considered Michael de Villeneuve &quot;his friend and brother&quot;, another in 1547 by Thibaut Payen, etc.

There is another Materia Medica with commentaries on a Ruel edition of 1537, printed by Simon de Colines. This work contains hundreds of manuscript marginaia, all along 420 out of 480 pages. The scholar Gonzalez Echeverria demonstrated in the ISHM with a graphological, historical and linguistic study that this task was carried out by Michel de Villeneuve. It also demonstrated that this document was written by the same hand that wrote the famous &quot;Manuscript of Paris&quot;, a work also by Michel de Villeneuve, consisting of a draft for his Christianismo Restitutio. &quot;The manuscript of the Complutense&quot; is not just a union of the ideas of the previous works by Michel de Villeneuve, Syropum Ratio, etc., but also of the later works, Enquiridion, De Materia Medica of 1543, sharing with this last many of its 20 big commentaries, for instance.

According to this theory, in 1554, after the immolation of Michael de Villeneuve/Servetus, the editors and printers that had worked with him would have decided to make a new De Materia Medica as a tribute to their colleague and friend. All the commentaries that could identify Michel de Villeneuve as the author disappeared, but the rest are copied from his work of 1543. It is a very strange edition because there exist four different kinds of copies with different covers, one per editor: Jean Frellon, Guillaume Rouillé, Antoine Vicent and Balthazar Arnoullet, who was also the printer of this unique edition, in Lyons. For developing a bigger work and to blur the mark of Michel de Villeneuve, they hired the expert on De Materia Medica, Pietro Andrea Mattioli.

===Pietro Andrea Mattioli===
Pietro Andrea Mattioli was a renowned botanist and physician. He published a translation of De Materia Medica into Italian in 1544 and ten years later published a work in Latin with all the plants of Dioscorides and 562 woodcut illustrations. It appeared in 1554, printed by Vicenzo Valgrisi, in Venice. Mattioli made a massive contribution to the original text of Pedani&#x27;s Dioscorides. In some sections Mattioli added information that exceeded 15 times the length of the original text. It resulted in a very big extension of the work, in beauty and information. It was later translated into German, French and Bohemian.

Mattioli held a post in the Imperial Court as physician to Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria, and the Emperor Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor. This position granted him an immense influence. He frequently tested the effects of poisonous plants on prisoners in order to popularize his works. He also affirmed that Jean Ruel had declared some information in the lycopsis chapter of his Materia Medica. This is false, but still Mattioli used it as a reason for attacking Ruel. He did not tolerate either rivals nor corrections. The naturalists and physicians daring to disagree with him, or who had corrected him, were attacked. The list of important characters that were admonished, rebuked, or pursued by the Inquisition contains Wieland, Anguillara, Gesner, Lusitanus and others. This made editions of Matioli&#x27;s De Materia Medica omnipresent throughout the continent, especially in northern Europe.

===Andres Laguna===
In 1554 the physician Andres Laguna published his Annotations on Dioscorides of Anazarbus printed by Guillaume Rouillé in Lyons. Laguna was the first to translate De Materia Medica into Castilian. His translation was made from one of the Latin editions of Jean Ruel. It was also based on classes Laguna took from Ruel as his pupil in Paris. Laguna points out some of his teacher&#x27;s erroneous translations, and adds many commentaries, which make up more than half of the total work.

Laguna explored many Mediterranean areas and obtained results concerning many new herbs; he also added these prescriptions and commentaries to the recipes and teachings of Pedanius&#x27; Dioscorides. He also includes some animal and mineral products but only those related to simple medicines, that is, animal and mineral products that are medicine or are parts of a medical compound. This was not an illustrated work. In 1555 he re-edited this work with woodcuts.
It was reprinted twenty-two times by the end of the 18th century; Laguna wrote very well, with explanations and practical commentaries. He refers to anecdotes, adds commentaries on the plants, provides their synonyms in different languages, and explains their uses in the 16th century. These qualities and the number of woodcuts made this work very popular and appreciated in medicine far beyond the 16th century. He had problems with Mattioli for using some of his commentaries without mentioning him.

Laguna had problems with the Inquisition, just like Michel de Villeneuve, for both were jewish-converso, a fact that could have made them limit their commentaries to avoid risks. Nevertheless, he was the physician of Charles V and the Pope Julius III, and that helped to establish his work as the last word in Materia Medica, and as the basis of Spanish botany.

===Valerius Cordus===
The physician Valerius Cordus, son of the famous botanist Euricius Cordus, went through many woods and mountains discovering hundreds of new herbs. He gave lectures on Dioscorides at the University of Wittenberg, which experts from the university attended. Cordus had no intention of publishing his work. Five years after his death, a Materia Medica with commentaries was published. It contained the index of the &quot;Botanologicon&quot;, the outstanding work of his father Euricius, who developed a scientific classification of the plants. The following pages are on Gesner&#x27;s Nomenclature, relating the different synonyms used for referring to the same plants of the Dioscorides work.

The abstracts of the lectures of Valerius Cordus go from page 449 to 553 as commentaries. This section consisted of a very refined explanation of Dioscorides&#x27; teachings with more specifics on the variety of plants and habitats, and corrections of errors. Cordus refers to both his and his father&#x27;s observations. Eucharius Rösslin&#x27;s herbal illustrations are prominent in this work, followed by 200 of Fuchs. This work and the model of botanical description and, many consider it the boldest innovation that was made by any botanist of the 16th century.

===Martin Mathee===

The French physician Martin Mathee published in 1553 the French translation of De Materia Medica, printed by Balthazar Arnoullet, in Lyons. This granted much more access for the students of medicine to the teachings.

The Greek version was reprinted in 1518, 1523 and 1529, and reprinted in 1518, 1523 and 1529. Between 1555 and 1752 there were at least 12 Spanish editions; and as many in Italian from 1542. French editions appeared from 1553; and German editions from 1546.

==&quot;Materia non medica&quot;==
The ancient phrase survives in modified form in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;″s long-established &quot;Materia Non Medica&quot; column, the title indicating non-medical material that doctors wished to report from their travels and other experiences. For example, in June 1977, the journal contained &quot;Materia Non Medica&quot; reports on an exhibition at the Whitechapel Art Gallery by a London physician, the making of matches by hand in an Indian village by a missionary general practitioner, and a cruise to Jamaica by a University of the West Indies lecturer in medicine.

<text>The Copeland or Llull method is a ranked-choice voting system based on counting each candidate&#x27;s pairwise wins and losses.

In the system, voters rank candidates from best to worst on their ballot. Candidates then compete in a round-robin tournament, where the ballots are used to determine which candidate would be preferred by a majority of voters in each matchup. The candidate is the one who wins the most matchups (with ties winning half a point).

Copeland&#x27;s method falls in the class of Condorcet methods, as any candidate who wins every one-on-one election will clearly have the most victories overall. Copeland&#x27;s method has the advantage of being likely the simplest Condorcet method to explain and of being easy to administer by hand. On the other hand, if there is no Condorcet winner, the procedure frequently results in ties. As a result, it is typically only used for low-stakes elections.

== History ==
Copeland&#x27;s method was devised by Ramon Llull in his 1299 treatise &quot;Ars Electionis,&quot; which was discussed by Nicholas of Cusa in the fifteenth century. However, it is frequently named after Arthur Herbert Copeland, who advocated it independently in a 1951 lecture.
==Voting mechanism==
=== Ballot ===
The input is the same as for other ranked voting systems: each voter must furnish an ordered preference list on candidates where ties are allowed (a strict weak order).

This can be done by providing each voter with a list of candidates on which to write a &quot;1&quot; against the most preferred candidate, a &quot;2&quot; against the second preference, and so forth. A voter who leaves some candidates&#x27; rankings blank is assumed to be indifferent between them but to prefer all ranked candidates to them.

=== Computation ===

A results matrix &quot;r&quot; is constructed as follows: &quot;rij&quot; is 

* 1 if more voters strictly prefer candidate &quot;i&quot; to candidate &quot;j&quot; than prefer &quot;j&quot; to &quot;i&quot;
* if the numbers are equal
* 0 if more voters prefer &quot;j&quot; to &quot;i&quot; than prefer &quot;i&quot; to &quot;j&quot;.

This may be called the &quot;1//0&quot; method (one number for wins, ties, and losses, respectively).

By convention, &quot;rii&quot; is 0.

The Copeland score for candidate &quot;i&quot; is the sum over &quot;j&quot; of the &quot;rij&quot;. If there is a candidate with a score of (where &quot;n&quot; is the number of candidates) then this candidate is the (necessarily unique) Condorcet and Copeland winner. Otherwise the Condorcet method produces no decision and the candidate with greatest score is the Copeland winner (but may not be unique).

An alternative (and equivalent) way to construct the results matrix is by letting &quot;rij&quot; be 1 if more voters strictly prefer candidate &quot;i&quot; to candidate &quot;j&quot; than prefer &quot;j&quot; to &quot;i&quot;, 0 if the numbers are equal, and −1 if more voters prefer &quot;j&quot; to &quot;i&quot; than prefer &quot;i&quot; to &quot;j&quot;. In this case the matrix &quot;r&quot; is antisymmetric.

===Tied preferences===
The method as initially described above is sometimes called the &quot;1//0&quot; method. Llull himself put forward a 1/1/0 method, so that two candidates with equal support would both get the same credit as if they had beaten the other.

Preference ties become increasingly unlikely as the number of voters increases.

===Use in sporting tournaments===
A method related to Copeland&#x27;s is commonly used in round-robin tournaments. Generally it is assumed that each pair of competitors plays the same number of games against each other. &quot;rij&quot; is the number of times competitor &quot;i&quot; won against competitor &quot;j&quot; plus half the number of draws between them.

It was adopted in precisely this form in international chess in the middle of the nineteenth century. It was adopted in the first season of the English Football League (1888–1889), the organisers having initially considered using a 1/0/0 system. For convenience the numbers were doubled, i.e. the system was written as 2/1/0 rather than as 1//0.

(The Borda count has also been used to judge sporting tournaments. The Borda count is analogous to a tournament in which every completed ballot determines the result of a game between every pair of competitors.)

==Rationale==
In many cases decided by Copeland&#x27;s method the winner is the unique candidate satisfying the Condorcet criterion; in these cases, the arguments for that criterion (which are powerful, but not universally accepted) apply equally to Copeland&#x27;s method.

When there is no Condorcet winner, Copeland&#x27;s method seeks to make a decision by a natural extension of the Condorcet method, combining preferences by simple addition. The justification for this lies more in its simplicity than in logical arguments. 

The Borda count is another method which combines preferences additively. The salient difference is that a voter&#x27;s preference for one candidate over another has a weight in the Borda system which increases with the number of candidates ranked between them. The argument from the viewpoint of the Borda count is that the number of intervening candidates gives an indication of the strength of the preference; the counter-argument is that it depends to a worrying degree on which candidates stood in the election.

Partha Dasgupta and Eric Maskin sought to justify Copeland&#x27;s method in a popular journal, where they compare it with the Borda count and plurality voting. Their argument turns on the merits of the Condorcet criterion, paying particular attention to opinions lying on a spectrum. The use of Copeland&#x27;s method in the first instance, and then of a tie-break, to decide elections with no Condorcet winner is presented as &quot;perhaps the simplest modification&quot; to the Condorcet method.

==Tied results==
Like any voting method, Copeland&#x27;s may give rise to tied results if two candidates receive equal numbers of votes; but unlike most methods, it may also lead to ties for causes which do not disappear as the electorate becomes larger. This may happen whenever there are Condorcet cycles in the voting preferences, as illustrated by the following example.

Suppose that there are four candidates, Able, Baker, Charlie and Drummond, and five voters, of whom two vote A-B-C-D, two vote B-C-D-A, and one votes D-A-B-C. The results between pairs of candidates are shown in the main part of the following table, with the Copeland score for the first candidate in the additional column.

No candidate satisfies the Condorcet criterion, and there is a Copeland tie between A and B. If there were 100 times as many voters, but they voted in roughly the same proportions (subject to sampling fluctuations), then the numbers of ballots would scale up but the Copeland scores would stay the same; for instance the &#x27;A&#x27; row might read:

The risk of ties is particularly concerning because the main aim of Copeland&#x27;s method is to produce a winner in cases when no candidate satisfies the Condorcet criterion. A simulation performed by Richard Darlington implies that for fields of up to 10 candidates, it will succeed in this task less than half the time.

In general, if voters vote according to preferences along a spectrum, the median voter theorem guarantees the absence of Condorcet cycles. Consequently such cycles can only arise either because voters&#x27; preferences do not lie along a spectrum or because voters do not vote according to their preferences (eg. for tactical reasons).

Nicolaus Tideman and Florenz Plassman conducted a large study of reported electoral preferences. They found a significant number of cycles in the subelections, but remarked that they could be attributed wholly or largely to the smallness of the numbers of voters. They concluded that it was consistent with their data to suppose that &quot;voting cycles will occur very rarely, if at all, in elections with many voters&quot;.

===Proposed tie breaks===
Instant runoff (IRV), minimax and the Borda count are natural tie-breaks. The first two are not frequently advocated for this use but are sometimes discussed in connection with Smith&#x27;s method where similar considerations apply.

Dasgupta and Maskin proposed the Borda count as a Copeland tie-break: this is known as the Dasgupta-Maskin method. It had previously been used in figure-skating under the name of the &#x27;OBO&#x27; (=one-by-one) rule.

The alternatives can be illustrated in the &#x27;Able-Baker&#x27; example above, in which Able and Baker are joint Copeland winners. Charlie and Drummond are eliminated, reducing the ballots to 3 A-Bs and 2 B-As. Any tie-break will then elect Able.

==Properties==
Copeland&#x27;s method has many of the standard desirable properties (see the table below). Most importantly it satisfies the Condorcet criterion, i.e. if a candidate would win against each of their rivals in a one-on-one vote, this candidate is the winner. Copeland&#x27;s method therefore satisfies the median voter theorem, which states that if views lie along a spectrum, then the winning candidate will be the one preferred by the median voter. 

Copeland&#x27;s method also satisfies the Smith criterion. 

The analogy between Copeland&#x27;s method and sporting tournaments, and the overall simplicity of Copeland&#x27;s method, has been argued to make it more acceptable to voters than other Condorcet algorithms.

===Comparison with other systems===
== Examples of the Copeland Method ==

=== Example with Condorcet winner ===
To find the Condorcet winner, every candidate must be matched against every other candidate in a series of imaginary one-on-one contests. In each pairing, each voter will choose the city physically closest to their location. In each pairing the winner is the candidate preferred by a majority of voters. When results for every possible pairing have been found they are as follows:

The wins and losses of each candidate sum as follows:

Nashville, with no defeats, is the Condorcet winner. The Copeland score under the 1/0/−1 method is the number of net wins, maximized by Nashville. Since the voters expressed a preference one way or the other between every pair of candidates, the score under the 1//0 method is just the number of wins, likewise maximized by Nashville. The &quot;r&quot; matrix for this scoring system is shown in the final column.

=== Example without Condorcet winner ===
In an election with five candidates competing for one seat, the following votes were cast using a ranked voting method (100 votes with four distinct sets):

In this example there are some tied votes: for instance 10% of the voters assigned no position to B or C in their rankings; they are therefore considered to have tied these candidates with each other while ranking them below D, A and E.

The results of the 10 possible pairwise comparisons between the candidates are as follows:

The wins and losses of each candidate sum as follows:

No Condorcet winner (candidate who beats all other candidates in pairwise comparisons) exists. Candidate A is the Copeland winner. Again there is no pair of candidates between whom the voters express no preference.

==Use for producing a tabulation in other methods==
Since Copeland&#x27;s method produces a total ordering of candidates by score and is simple to compute, it is often useful for producing a sorted list of candidates in conjunction with another voting method which does not produce a total order. For example, the Schulze and Ranked pairs methods produce a transitive partial ordering of candidates, which generally produces a single winner, but not a unique way of tabulating runner-ups. Applying Copeland&#x27;s method according to the respective method&#x27;s partial ordering will yield a total order (topological ordering) guaranteed to be compatible with the method&#x27;s partial order, and is simpler than a depth-first search when the partial order is given by an adjacency matrix. 

More generally, the Copeland score has the useful property that if there is a subset S of candidates such that every candidate in S will beat every candidate not in S, then there exists a threshold θ such that every candidate with a Copeland score above θ is in S while every candidate with a Copeland score below θ is not in S. This makes the Copeland score practical for finding various subsets of candidates that may be of interest, such as the Smith set or the dominant mutual third set.

<doc id="203556" wikidata="Q844587" url="?curid=203556" title="Prime Minister of Spain">
<text>The prime minister of Spain, officially president of the Government (), is the head of government of Spain. The prime minister nominates the ministers and chairs the Council of Ministers. In this sense, the prime minister establishes the Government policies and coordinates the actions of the Cabinet members. As chief executive, the prime minister also advises the monarch on the exercise of their royal prerogatives.

Although it is not possible to determine when the position actually originated, the office of prime minister has evolved throughout history to what it is today. The role of prime minister (then called Secretary of State) as president of the Council of Ministers, first appears in a royal decree of 1824 by King Ferdinand VII. The current office was established during the reign of Juan Carlos I, in the 1978 Constitution, which describes the prime minister&#x27;s constitutional role and powers, how the prime minister accedes to, and is removed from office, and the relationship between the prime minister and Parliament.

Upon a vacancy, the monarch nominates a candidate for a vote of confidence by the Congress of Deputies, the lower house of the . The process is a parliamentary investiture by which the head of government is elected by the Congress of Deputies. In practice, the prime minister is almost always the leader of the largest party in the Congress, although not necessarily. The prime minister&#x27;s official residence and office is Moncloa Palace in Madrid.

Pedro Sánchez, of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE), has been prime minister since 2 June 2018. He first came to power after a successful motion of no confidence against former prime minister Mariano Rajoy. Since then, Sánchez has led three governments, the most—along with Adolfo Suárez—just behind fellow socialist Felipe González, prime minister from 1982 to 1996. King Felipe VI re-appointed Sánchez for the third time on 17 November 2023 after he reached a coalition agreement with &quot;Sumar&quot; and gathered the support of other minor parties. His third government took office on 21 November 2023.

==Official title==
The Spanish head of government has been known, since 1939, as &quot;President of the Government&quot; ().

Not only is this term confusing for English speakers because Spain is not a republic, but because the parliamentary speakers are also referred to as presidents of their respective chambers. For example, both President George W. Bush and his brother, Florida governor Jeb Bush, referred to José María Aznar as &quot;president&quot; on separate occasions, and Donald Trump referred to Mariano Rajoy both as &quot;President&quot; and &quot;Mr. President&quot; during Rajoy&#x27;s 2017 White House visit. While this term of address was not incorrect, it could be misleading to English speakers so is commonly used as a culturally equivalent term to ensure clarity.

Use of the term &quot;president&quot; dates back to 1834 and the regency of Maria Christina when, styled after the head of government of the French July Monarchy (1830), the official title was the &quot;President of the Council of Ministers&quot; (). This remained until 1939, when the Second Spanish Republic ended. Before 1834 the figure was known as &quot;Secretary of State&quot; (), a denomination used today for junior ministers.

Spain was not unique in this regard: it was one of several European parliamentary systems, including France, Italy and the Irish Free State, that styled the head of government as &#x27;presidents&#x27; of the government rather than the Westminster term of &#x27;prime minister&#x27; (see President of the Council for the full list of corresponding terms). However the term &#x27;&#x27; is far older.

==Origin==

Since the 15th century, the Spanish monarchs has delegated its executive powers in relevant personalities. Two are the most important: the validos and the secretaries of state. The &quot;validos&quot;, which existed since early 15th century to the late 17th century were people of the highest confidence of the monarchs and they exercised the Crown&#x27;s power in the monarch&#x27;s name. Since the 18th century, the &quot;validos&quot; disappeared and the secretaries of state were introduced. Both positions were &quot;de facto&quot; prime ministers (as demonstrated by the fact that since the tenure of the count-duke of Olivares, &quot;valido&quot; of Felipe IV, the &quot;validos&quot; were often called by courtiers and authors already in the 17th century as &quot;principal minister or prime minister of Spain&quot;) although they can not be completely compared.

On 19 November 1823, after a brief liberal democratic period called the Liberal Triennium between 1820 and 1823, King Ferdinand VII re-established the absolute monarchy and created the Council of Ministers that continues to exist today. This council, when not chaired by the monarch, was chaired by the secretary of state for foreign affairs (), who acted as prime minister. This role was ratified by the Royal Statute of 1834, which constitutionalized for the first time the figure of the prime minister under the name of &quot;President of the Council of Ministers&quot;, invested with executive powers.

During the 19th century, the position changed names frequently. After the Glorious Revolution of 1868, it was renamed &quot;President of the Provisional Revolutionary Joint&quot; and later &quot;President of the Provisional Government&quot;. In 1869, the office resumed the name of &quot;President of the Council of Ministers&quot;. Following the abdication of King Amadeus I, during the First Republic (1873–1874) the office was known as the &quot;President of the Executive Power&quot; and was also head of state. In 1874, the office name reverted to &quot;President of the Council of Ministers&quot;.

Since its inception, the prime minister has been appointed and dismissed by the will of the monarch. Successive constitutions have confirmed this royal prerogative of the monarch in the Constitution of 1837 (article 47), article 46 of the Constitution of 1845, the Constitution of 1869 (article 68), and the Constitution of 1876 (article 54).

With the fall of the First Republic and the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty on King Alfonso XII, the office maintained its original name until the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, when it was renamed to &quot;President of the Military Directory&quot;. In 1925, the original name was restored again.The Republican Constitution of 1931 provided for the prime minister and the rest of the government to be appointed and dismissed by the President of the Republic but they were responsible before the Parliament and the Parliament could vote to dismiss the prime minister or a minister even against the will of the president of the republic. In the Civil War, the head of government among the Nationalists was called &quot;Chief of the Government of the State&quot; and since January 1938 the office acquired the current name, &quot;President of the Government,&quot; but between that date and 1973 the office was held by Francisco Franco as dictator of Spain.

In 1973, Francisco Franco separated the head of state from the head of government, and that division still exists today, with the prime minister democratically elected by the Parliament which is itself elected by universal suffrage, free and equal. Adolfo Suárez was the first democratically elected prime minister of the post-Franco government. He was originally appointed by King Juan Carlos I on 3 July 1976, and he was confirmed in the office by popular vote after the 1977 Spanish general election.

==Royal nomination and congressional confirmation==
Once a general election has been called by the monarch, political parties designate their candidates to stand for prime minister—usually the party leader. A prime minister is dismissed from office the day after the election, but remains in office as a caretaker until his/her successor is sworn in.

Following the general election and other circumstances provided for in the Constitution, the sovereign meets with the leaders of the parties represented in the Congress of Deputies, and then consults with the Speaker of the Congress of Deputies () as representative of the whole of parliament), before nominating a candidate for the prime ministership. This process is spelled out in Section 99 of the Constitution.

By political custom established by Juan Carlos I since the ratification of the 1978 Constitution, the sovereign&#x27;s nominees have usually been from parties who have a plurality of seats in the Congress (i.e. the largest party). Although there is no legal requirement for this, it is seen as a royal endorsement of the democratic process—a fundamental concept enshrined in the 1978 Constitution. The largest party can end up not ruling if rival parties form a coalition—as happened in 2018 with the election of PSOE leader Pedro Sánchez. More commonly, if neither of the two major parties (Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party or People&#x27;s Party) are able to command an absolute majority of the Congress by themselves, one will rule as a minority by adopting some aspects of the minor party platforms in an effort to attract them into parliamentary agreements to vote in the major party&#x27;s favour, or at least abstain.

The monarch&#x27;s order nominating a prime ministerial candidate is countersigned by the Speaker of the Congress, who then presents the nominee before the Congress of Deputies in a process known as a &quot;parliamentary investiture&quot; (&quot;Investidura parlamentaria&quot;). During the investiture proceedings, the candidate describes their political agenda in an &quot;Investiture Speech&quot; to be debated and submitted for a vote of confidence (&quot;Cuestión de confianza&quot;) by the Congress, effecting an indirect election of the head of government.

Confidence is awarded if the candidate receives a majority of votes in the first poll (currently 176 out of 350 MPs), but if the confidence is not granted, a second vote is scheduled forty-eight hours later in which a simple majority of votes cast (i.e., more &quot;yes&quot; than &quot;no&quot; votes) is required. Following the second vote, if confidence by the Congress is still not reached, then the monarch again meets with political leaders and the Speaker, and submits a new nominee for a vote of confidence (exceptionally, in 2016 King Felipe VI opted for not nominating more candidates and call for new elections). If, within two months, no candidate has won the confidence of the Congress then the monarch dissolves the Cortes and calls for a new general election. The monarch&#x27;s royal decree is countersigned by the Speaker of the Congress.

=== Oath of office ===

After the nominee is confirmed, the Speaker of the Congress formally reports the fact to the sovereign. The monarch then appoints the candidate as the new prime minister and this too is countersigned by the Speaker.

During the swearing-in ceremony presided over by the monarch, customarily at the Audience Hall of the Royal Palace of Zarzuela, the prime minister–designate takes an oath of office over an open Constitution and—at choice since 2014—next to a Bible and a crucifix. The prime minister must take the oath or affirmation placing the right hand on the Constitution. Currently, only one prime minister has refused to take the oath of office next to religious symbols: Pedro Sánchez, along with most of his Cabinet members. His predecessor, Mariano Rajoy, a Catholic, put his right hand on the Constitution and, at the same time, his left hand on the Bible. As per tradition, if the members of the government choose not to take the oath along with any religious symbols, they use the word &quot;prometo&quot; (&quot;I promise&quot;), whereas if the take the oath with the Bible, they use the word &quot;juro&quot; (&quot;I swear&quot;). The oath as taken by Prime Minister Zapatero on his first term in office on 17 April 2004 was:

Once appointed, the prime minister forms his government whose ministers are appointed and removed by the monarch on the prime minister&#x27;s advice. In the political life of Spain, the monarch would already be familiar with the various political leaders in a professional capacity, and perhaps less formally in a more social capacity, facilitating their meeting following a general election. Conversely, nominating the party leader whose party maintains a plurality and who are already familiar with their party manifesto facilitates a smoother nomination process. In the event of coalitions, the political leaders would customarily have met beforehand to hammer out a coalition agreement before their meeting with the Sovereign.

==Constitutional authority==
Title IV of the Constitution defines the Government and its responsibilities. The Government consists of the prime minister and the ministers. The government conducts domestic and foreign policy, civil and military administration, and the defense of the nation all in the name of the monarch on behalf of the people. Additionally, the government exercises executive authority and statutory regulations. The main collective decision-making body of the Government is the Council of Ministers, chaired by the prime minister and, after a formal request by the Prime Minister, by the monarch.

There is no provision in the Spanish Constitution for explicitly granting any emergency powers to the government. However, Section 56 of the Constitution vests the monarch as the &quot;arbitrator and moderator of the institutions&quot; of government, &quot;[The King] arbitrates and moderates the regular functioning of the institutions&quot; (&quot;arbitra y modera el funcionamiento regular de las instituciones&quot;). This provision could be understood as allowing the monarch or his government ministers to exercise emergency authority in times of national crisis, such as when the monarch used his authority to back the government of the day and call for the military to abandon the 23-F coup attempt in 1981.

The prime minister also assumes political responsibility for most acts of the sovereign. While the monarch is vested with executive power, his acts are not valid unless countersigned by a minister. Under Article 64 of the Constitution, that minister—usually the prime minister—assumes political responsibility for the act in question. In these sense, the Constitution grants the prime minister the initiative to request the monarch for calling a referendum, for calling for new elections or for dissolving any of the legislative chambers. In Spain, the government ministers cannot force the prime minister resignation and this idea is reinforced when the Constitution grants the prime minister the sole initiative to request the Congress for a vote of confidence. In constitutional matters, the primacy of the prime minister over the ministers is also evident, since the prime ministers alone is responsible for the government initiative to challenge the constitutionality of a law.

== Office of the Prime Minister ==

The Office of the Prime Minister (, ) is the combination of government departments and services that are at the service of the Prime Minister to fulfill its constitutional duties. It was established around 1834 when officials and budget began to be assigned to the personal Secretariat of the Prime Minister. Today, it acts as a ministerial department, although it is not formally one of them, and approximately 2,000 people work there.

The Prime Minister&#x27;s Office principal departments are:

* The Ministry of the Presidency.
** The Secretariat of State for Relations with the Cortes and Constitutional Affairs.
** The Secretariat of State for Democratic Memory.
* The Cabinet Office, headed by the Moncloa Chief of Staff.
** The General Secretariat of the Presidency of the Government.
** The Department of National Security.
* The Office for Economic Affairs and G20, with the rank of secretariat of state.
* The Secretariat of State for Press.

The autonomous agency Patrimonio Nacional, which manages Crown properties, depends on this Office through the Ministry of the Presidency.

=== Security and transport ===

The Cabinet Office, through the General Secretariat of the Presidency of the Government, is responsible for the protocol and security affairs. Within the General Secretariat, there is a Department of Security of the Presidency of the Government (DSPG) that coordinates the efforts of the National Police Corps and the Civil Guard in the protection of the Prime Minister and his family, as well as the infraestructure and personnel of the Moncloa Government Complex.

The vehicles used by the Prime Minister are provided by the State Vehicle Fleet (PME), an autonomous agency of the Ministry of Finance that provides the government with all type of vehicles and well-trained drivers. The air transportation of the Prime Minister and other government officials is mainly provided by the 45th Air Force Group (planes) and the 402nd Air Force Squadron (helicopters).

== Resignation and dissolution of Parliament ==
The Parliament, and thus, the Government, sit for a term no longer than four years. Before that date, the prime minister may offer his resignation to the sovereign. If the Prime Minister does so while advising the monarch to dissolve parliament, the sovereign will call for a snap election, but no sooner than a year after the prior general election. 

If a prime minister resigns without advising the monarch to call for new elections, dies or becomes incapacitated while in office, then the government as a whole resigns and the process of royal nomination and appointment takes place. The deputy prime minister, or in the absence of such office, the first minister by precedence, would then take over the day-to-day operations in the meantime as acting-prime minister, even while the deputy prime minister themselves may be nominated by the monarch and stand for a vote of confidence. Also, if at the conclusion of the four years, the prime minister has not asked for its dissolution, according to Title II Section 56, the monarch must dissolve the Parliament and call for a new general election.

Although the prime minister&#x27;s position is strengthened by constitutional limits on the Congress&#x27; right to withdraw confidence from the government, the Cortes Generales has two ways of forcing the prime minister&#x27;s resignation: passing a motion of no confidence or rejecting a motion of confidence. In the first case, and following the German model, a prime minister can only be removed by a constructive vote of no confidence. While the Congress can censure the government at any time, the censure motion must also include the name of a prospective replacement for the incumbent prime minister. If the censure motion is successful, the replacement candidate is automatically deemed to have the confidence of the Congress, and the monarch is required to appoint them as the new prime minister. As of 2023, only Pedro Sánchez managed to remove a sitting prime minister with a vote of no confidence in 2018, making him prime minister. In the second case, the prime minister, after deliberation by the Council of Ministers, can propose a vote of confidence regarding the government&#x27;s policies in Congress. If Congress does not give the prime minister its confidence, the prime minister must resign. As of 2023, only prime minister Adolfo Suárez in 1980 and Felipe González in 1990 proposed a vote of confidence, both successfully.

== Precedence, privileges and form of address ==

The Prime Minister is the second authority of the Kingdom of Spain, outranking all other State authorities except members of the royal family.

In 2023, the Prime Minister received a salary of €90,010 and additional €13,422 as member of parliament. With this salary, the prime minister is not the highest paid official of Spain, being surpassed by other State authorities such as the royal family (the King, €269,296; the Queen, €148,105; and the Queen Mother, €121,186), the president of the Congress of Deputies (€230,931), the president of the Constitutional Court (€167,169), the president of the Supreme Court (€151,186) and the president of the Court of Auditors (€130,772), among others.

The prime minister is constitutionally protected against ordinary prosecution. Although the Prime Minister does not have legal immunity like the monarch, the prime minister, as well as the members of the Royal Family, the Government, the Congress of Deputies and the Senate, can only be criminally responsible before the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court (Spanish Constitution, Part IV § 102).

Although it is not formally regulated, Spanish custom establishes that the prime minister receives the treatment of The Most Excellent (). This treatment has been customary for the government ministers since, at least, the 18th century, and in the case of the prime minister, this treatment is reinforced as member of the Order of Charles III, whose article 13 states that &quot;the Knights and the Dames of the Collar, as well as the Knights and Dames Grand Cross, will receive the treatment of Most Excellent Lord and Most Excellent Lady&quot;.

== Deputy ==

The Spanish Constitution foresee the office of deputy prime minister and also the possibility of having more than one deputy prime minister. Although the position of deputy prime minister has existed intermittently since 1840, the Constitution endorses what was established in the Organic Act of the State of 1967, which provided for the first time the possibility of appointing more than one deputy and, in 1974, this provision became effective when Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro appointed three deputies (José García Hernández, Antonio Barrera de Irimo and Licinio de la Fuente). Since then, three more prime ministers (Adolfo Suárez, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero and Pedro Sánchez) have had more than one deputy. The second government of Pedro Sánchez holds the record for most deputies, appointing four. This large number of deputy prime ministerships was interpreted as a maneuver to reduce the political weight of his second deputy prime minister and leader of the minority party in the coalition, Pablo Iglesias Turrión.

=== Succession ===
According to article 101 of the Spanish Constitution, the prime minister and its government only ceases in the cases of resignation, a failed motion of confidence, a motion of no confidence against the prime minister or the death of the prime minister. In the first three options, there is no succession, because the prime minister remains as caretaker prime minister until a new prime minister is elected by the Congress of Deputies.

If the Prime Minister dies, the 1997 Government Act provides that the Prime Minister be succeeded by the Deputy Prime Minister and, if there is more than one, by the Deputy Prime Ministers, depending on their order. If there is no deputy prime minister, the Government Act establishes that the prime minister will be replaced by the ministers, according to the order of precedence of the Departments. This means that the first in the line of succession after the deputy prime ministers would be the Minister of Foreign Affairs, followed by the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Defense and the Minister of Finance. These four ministers are the first and great offices created in 1714 by King Philip V.

== Order of Charles III ==
The Order of Charles III, officially the Royal and Distinguished Spanish Order of Charles III, was established in 1771 by King Charles III and is today the country&#x27;s highest civil honor. The current regulation of the order, established in October 2002, states that the prime minister is the Grand Chancellor of the Order (second to the Grand Master, the Monarch).

Upon taking office, the new prime minister shall be invested with the degree of Knight or Dame Grand Cross of the Order and with this rank he will act as Grand Chancellor of the same. It is responsibility of the Grand Chancellor to submit to the approval of the Council of Ministers Royal Decrees granting the degrees of Collar and Grand Cross, and all titles of the different degrees of the Royal Order must bear his signature and the monarch&#x27;s.

The last person to join the order was Sergio Mattarella, President of the Italian Republic, who was awarded the collar of the order in December 2024 on the occasion of the State visit of the Spanish monarchs to Italy.

== Retirement honours and privileges ==
Upon retirement, it is customary for the monarch to grant a prime minister some honour or dignity. The honour bestowed is commonly the Collar of the Order of Isabella the Catholic, the second highest civil honor, while the ministers receive the Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III (the highest civil distinction). This is because the prime minister is, since he is appointed as such by the sovereign, a Knight or Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III, for which he is awarded the next highest distinction.

In addition to these honors, the monarch might offer the former prime minister a peerage, being the highest marks of distinction that he may bestow in his capacity as the &quot;fons honorum&quot; in Spain. Conventionally, the &quot;Title of Concession&quot; creating the dignity must be countersigned by a government minister. When a title is created for a former prime minister, the succeeding prime minister customarily countersigns the royal decree.

Although prior to the reign of Alfonso XIII many noble titles were granted —or the rank of those who already possessed it one was raised— to prime ministers and ministers (such as the Dukedom of Prim —granted to the daughter of late prime minister Juan Prim— or the Dukedom of Castillejos —awarded to the other son of the aforementioned prime minister—), it was not until this historical period when it became customary, since King Alfonso XIII granted a total of sixteen of these dignities to former prime ministers or their relatives during his reign. Of these, four were dukedoms (granted to relatives of assassinated prime ministers), three were marquessates and two counties, as well as seven grandships were granted. Likewise, the monarch also rewarded with numerous golden fleeces. King Juan Carlos I wanted to restore this tradition and, therefore, as a reward for their service, the last noble titles granted (both with grandship) were those of Adolfo Suárez (to whom the golden fleece was also awarded in 2007), who was created Duke of Suárez in 1981 and Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, created in 2002, twenty years after holding the office. The last prime minister to be offered a noble title was Felipe González, who rejected the offer. Since then, neither King Juan Carlos I nor King Felipe VI have offered prime ministers such an honor.

=== Staff, salary and office ===
In 1983, the first government of Felipe González established the &quot;Statute of Former Prime Ministers&quot;, which granted retired prime ministers, for four years, the right to have an office composed by two civil servants, a minimum endowment of 2.5 million pesetas each year for office expenses and an official vehicle with driver.

Nine years later, the government updated the Statute, removing the time limit the prime minister would receive privileges, including diplomatic assistance abroad, security, a personal salary for two years after leaving the office and, free pass in public transportation and an undetermined endowment for office expenses.

Since 2004, the retired prime ministers are eligible for a seat in the Council of State for life. As of 2023, only Jose María Aznar (2005–2006) and José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero (2011–2015) used this privilege.

For the fiscal year 2023, each of the living prime ministers receive €74,580 for the sustenance of their respective offices.

<doc id="203565" wikidata="Q637347" url="?curid=203565" title="Polynomial interpolation">
<text>In numerical analysis, polynomial interpolation is the interpolation of a given data set by the polynomial of lowest possible degree that passes through the ordered pair of points in the dataset.

Given a set of data points formula_1, with no two formula_2 the same, a polynomial function formula_3 is said to interpolate the data if formula_4 for each formula_5.

There is always a unique such polynomial, commonly given by two explicit formulas, the Lagrange polynomials and Newton polynomials.

== Applications ==
The original use of interpolation polynomials was to approximate values of important transcendental functions such as natural logarithm and trigonometric functions. Starting with a few accurately computed data points, the corresponding interpolation polynomial will approximate the function at an arbitrary nearby point. Polynomial interpolation also forms the basis for algorithms in numerical quadrature (Simpson&#x27;s rule) and numerical ordinary differential equations (multigrid methods).

In computer graphics, polynomials can be used to approximate complicated plane curves given a few specified points, for example the shapes of letters in typography. This is usually done with Bézier curves, which are a simple generalization of interpolation polynomials (having specified tangents as well as specified points).

In numerical analysis, polynomial interpolation is essential to perform sub-quadratic multiplication and squaring, such as Karatsuba multiplication and Toom–Cook multiplication, where interpolation through points on a product polynomial yields the specific product required. For example, given &quot;a&quot; = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;a&quot;0&quot;x&quot;0 + &quot;a&quot;1&quot;x&quot;1 + ··· and &quot;b&quot; = &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;b&quot;0&quot;x&quot;0 + &quot;b&quot;1&quot;x&quot;1 + ···, the product &quot;ab&quot; is a specific value of &quot;W&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)&quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). One may easily find points along &quot;W&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) at small values of &quot;x&quot;, and interpolation based on those points will yield the terms of &quot;W&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and the specific product &quot;ab&quot;. As fomulated in Karatsuba multiplication, this technique is substantially faster than quadratic multiplication, even for modest-sized inputs, especially on parallel hardware.

In computer science, polynomial interpolation also leads to algorithms for secure multi party computation and secret sharing.

==Interpolation theorem==
For any formula_6 bivariate data points formula_7, where no two formula_2 are the same, there exists a unique polynomial formula_9 of degree at most formula_10 that interpolates these points, i.e. formula_11.

Equivalently, for a fixed choice of interpolation nodes formula_2, polynomial interpolation defines a linear bijection formula_13 between the (&quot;n&quot;+1)-tuples of real-number values formula_14 and the vector space formula_15 of real polynomials of degree at most &quot;n&quot;:
formula_16

This is a type of unisolvence theorem. The theorem is also valid over any infinite field in place of the real numbers formula_17, for example the rational or complex numbers.

===First proof===
Consider the Lagrange basis functions formula_18 given by:
formula_19

Notice that formula_20 is a polynomial of degree formula_10, and we have formula_22 for each formula_23, while formula_24. It follows that the linear combination:
formula_25
has formula_26, so formula_9 is an interpolating polynomial of degree formula_10.

To prove uniqueness, assume that there exists another interpolating polynomial formula_29 of degree at most formula_10, so that formula_31 for all formula_32. Then formula_33 is a polynomial of degree at most formula_10 which has formula_6 distinct zeros (the formula_36). But a non-zero polynomial of degree at most formula_10 can have at most formula_10 zeros, so formula_33 must be the zero polynomial, i.e. formula_40.

===Second proof===
Write out the interpolation polynomial in the form

Substituting this into the interpolation equations formula_41, we get a system of linear equations in the coefficients formula_42, which reads in matrix-vector form as the following multiplication:
formula_43

An interpolant formula_9 corresponds to a solution formula_45 of the above matrix equation formula_46. The matrix &quot;X&quot; on the left is a Vandermonde matrix, whose determinant is known to be formula_47 which is non-zero since the nodes formula_2 are all distinct. This ensures that the matrix is invertible and the equation has the unique solution formula_49; that is, formula_9 exists and is unique.

===Corollary===
If formula_51 is a polynomial of degree at most formula_10, then the interpolating polynomial of formula_51 at formula_6 distinct points is formula_51 itself.

==Constructing the interpolation polynomial==
=== Lagrange Interpolation ===
We may write down the polynomial immediately in terms of Lagrange polynomials as:
formula_56For matrix arguments, this formula is called Sylvester&#x27;s formula and the matrix-valued Lagrange polynomials are the Frobenius covariants.

=== Newton Interpolation ===
==== Theorem ====
For a polynomial formula_57 of degree less than or equal to formula_10, that interpolates formula_59 at the nodes formula_60 where formula_61. Let formula_62 be the polynomial of degree less than or equal to formula_6 that interpolates formula_59 at the nodes formula_60 where formula_66. Then formula_62 is given by:formula_68where formula_69 also known as Newton basis and formula_70.

Proof:

This can be shown for the case where formula_61:formula_72and when formula_73:formula_74By the uniqueness of interpolated polynomials of degree less than formula_6, formula_76 is the required polynomial interpolation. The function can thus be expressed as:

formula_77

==== Polynomial coefficients ====
To find formula_78, we have to solve the lower triangular matrix formed by arranging formula_79 from above equation in matrix form:
: formula_80

The coefficients are derived as
: formula_81

where

: formula_82

is the notation for divided differences. Thus, Newton polynomials are used to provide a polynomial interpolation formula of n points.

==== Newton forward formula ====
The Newton polynomial can be expressed in a simplified form when formula_83 are arranged consecutively with equal spacing.

If formula_83 are consecutively arranged and equally spaced with formula_85 for &quot;i&quot; = 0, 1, ..., &quot;k&quot; and some variable x is expressed as formula_86, then the difference formula_87 can be written as formula_88. So the Newton polynomial becomes

: formula_89

Since the relationship between divided differences and forward differences is given as:formula_90Taking formula_91, if the representation of x in the previous sections was instead taken to be formula_92, the Newton forward interpolation formula is expressed as:formula_93which is the interpolation of all points after formula_2. It is expanded as:formula_95

==== Newton backward formula ====
If the nodes are reordered as formula_96, the Newton polynomial becomes

: formula_97

If formula_98 are equally spaced with formula_99 for &quot;i&quot; = 0, 1, ..., &quot;k&quot; and formula_100, then,

: formula_101

Since the relationship between divided differences and backward differences is given as:formula_102taking formula_91, if the representation of x in the previous sections was instead taken to be formula_92, the Newton backward interpolation formula is expressed as:formula_105which is the interpolation of all points before formula_2. It is expanded as:formula_107

=== Lozenge Diagram ===
A Lozenge diagram is a diagram that is used to describe different interpolation formulas that can be constructed for a given data set. A line starting on the left edge and tracing across the diagram to the right can be used to represent an interpolation formula if the following rules are followed:
# Left to right steps indicate addition whereas right to left steps indicate subtraction
# If the slope of a step is positive, the term to be used is the product of the difference and the factor immediately below it. If the slope of a step is negative, the term to be used is the product of the difference and the factor immediately above it.
# If a step is horizontal and passes through a factor, use the product of the factor and the average of the two terms immediately above and below it. If a step is horizontal and passes through a difference, use the product of the difference and the average of the two terms immediately above and below it.

The factors are expressed using the formula:formula_108

==== Proof of equivalence ====
If a path goes from formula_109 to formula_110, it can connect through three intermediate steps, (a) through formula_111, (b) through formula_112 or (c) through formula_113. Proving the equivalence of these three two-step paths should prove that all (n-step) paths can be morphed with the same starting and ending, all of which represents the same formula.

Path (a):

formula_114

Path (b):

formula_115

Path (c):

formula_116

Subtracting contributions from path a and b:

formula_117

Thus, the contribution of either path (a) or path (b) is the same. Since path (c) is the average of path (a) and (b), it also contributes identical function to the polynomial. Hence the equivalence of paths with same starting and ending points is shown. To check if the paths can be shifted to different values in the leftmost corner, taking only two step paths is sufficient: (a) formula_118 to formula_119 through formula_120 or (b) factor between formula_118 and formula_119, to formula_119 through formula_120 or (c) starting from formula_119.

Path (a)

formula_126

Path (b)

formula_127

Path (c)

formula_119

Since formula_129, substituting in the above equations shows that all the above terms reduce to formula_119 and are hence equivalent. Hence these paths can be morphed to start from the leftmost corner and end in a common point.

==== Newton formula ====
Taking negative slope transversal from formula_131 to formula_132 gives the interpolation formula of all the formula_133 consecutively arranged points, equivalent to Newton&#x27;s forward interpolation formula:

formula_134

whereas, taking positive slope transversal from formula_135 to formula_136, gives the interpolation formula of all the formula_133 consecutively arranged points, equivalent to Newton&#x27;s backward interpolation formula:

formula_138

where formula_139 is the number corresponding to that introduced in Newton interpolation.

==== Gauss formula ====
Taking a zigzag line towards the right starting from formula_131 with negative slope, we get Gauss forward formula:

formula_141

whereas starting from formula_131 with positive slope, we get Gauss backward formula:

formula_143

==== Stirling formula ====
By taking a horizontal path towards the right starting from formula_131, we get Stirling formula:

formula_145

Stirling formula is the average of Gauss forward and Gauss backward formulas.

==== Bessel formula ====
By taking a horizontal path towards the right starting from factor between formula_131 and formula_147, we get Bessel formula:

formula_148

=== Vandermonde Algorithms ===
The Vandermonde matrix in the second proof above may have large condition number, causing large errors when computing the coefficients if the system of equations is solved using Gaussian elimination.

Several authors have therefore proposed algorithms which exploit the structure of the Vandermonde matrix to compute numerically stable solutions in O(&quot;n&quot;2) operations instead of the O(&quot;n&quot;3) required by Gaussian elimination. These methods rely on constructing first a Newton interpolation of the polynomial and then converting it to a monomial form.

=== Non-Vandermonde algorithms ===
To find the interpolation polynomial &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) in the vector space &quot;P&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) of polynomials of degree , we may use the usual monomial basis for &quot;P&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) and invert the Vandermonde matrix by Gaussian elimination, giving a computational cost of O(&quot;n&quot;3) operations. To improve this algorithm, a more convenient basis for &quot;P&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) can simplify the calculation of the coefficients, which must then be translated back in terms of the monomial basis.

One method is to write the interpolation polynomial in the Newton form (i.e. using Newton basis) and use the method of divided differences to construct the coefficients, e.g. Neville&#x27;s algorithm. The cost is O(&quot;n&quot;2) operations. Furthermore, you only need to do O(&quot;n&quot;) extra work if an extra point is added to the data set, while for the other methods, you have to redo the whole computation.

Another method is preferred when the aim is not to compute the &quot;coefficients&quot; of &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), but only a &quot;single value&quot; &quot;p&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) at a point &quot;x = a&quot; not in the original data set. The Lagrange form computes the value &quot;p&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) with complexity O(&quot;n&quot;2).

The Bernstein form was used in a constructive proof of the Weierstrass approximation theorem by Bernstein and has gained great importance in computer graphics in the form of Bézier curves.

Given a set of (position, value) data points formula_149 where no two positions formula_2 are the same, the interpolating polynomial formula_151 may be considered as a linear combination of the values formula_152, using coefficients which are polynomials in formula_153 depending on the formula_2. For example, the interpolation polynomial in the Lagrange form is the linear combination
formula_155
with each coefficient formula_156 given by the corresponding Lagrange basis polynomial on the given positions formula_2:
formula_158

Since the coefficients depend only on the positions formula_2, not the values formula_152, we can use the &quot;same coefficients&quot; to find the interpolating polynomial for a second set of data points formula_161 at the same positions:
formula_162

Furthermore, the coefficients formula_156 only depend on the relative spaces formula_164 between the positions. Thus, given a third set of data whose points are given by the new variable formula_165 (an affine transformation of formula_153, inverted by formula_167):
formula_168
we can use a transformed version of the previous coefficient polynomials:formula_169 and write the interpolation polynomial as:formula_170Data points formula_171 often have &quot;equally spaced positions&quot;, which may be normalized by an affine transformation to formula_172. For example, consider the data pointsformula_173.The interpolation polynomial in the Lagrange form is the linear combination
formula_174

For example, formula_175 and formula_176.

The case of equally spaced points can also be treated by the method of finite differences. The first difference of a sequence of values formula_177 is the sequence formula_178 defined by formula_179. Iterating this operation gives the &quot;n&quot;th difference operation formula_180, defined explicitly by:formula_181where the coefficients form a signed version of Pascal&#x27;s triangle, the triangle of binomial transform coefficients:
A polynomial formula_151 of degree &quot;d&quot; defines a sequence of values at positive integer points, formula_183, and the formula_184 difference of this sequence is identically zero: formula_185. Thus, given values formula_186 at equally spaced points, where formula_187, we have: formula_188For example, 4 equally spaced data points formula_189 of a quadratic formula_151 obey formula_191, and solving for formula_192 gives the same interpolation equation obtained above using the Lagrange method.

==Interpolation error: Lagrange remainder formula==
When interpolating a given function &quot;f&quot; by a polynomial formula_57 of degree at the nodes &quot;x&quot;0..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; we get the error
formula_194
where formula_195 is the (&quot;n&quot;+1)st divided difference of the data points formula_196.Furthermore, there is a &quot;Lagrange remainder form&quot; of the error, for a function &quot;f&quot; which is times continuously differentiable on a closed interval formula_197, and a polynomial formula_198 of degree at most that interpolates &quot;f&quot; at distinct points formula_199. For each formula_200 there exists formula_201 such that
formula_202

This error bound suggests choosing the interpolation points to minimize the product formula_203, which is achieved by the Chebyshev nodes.

=== Proof of Lagrange remainder ===
Set the error term as formula_204, and define an auxiliary function:formula_205Thus:formula_206

But since formula_198 is a polynomial of degree at most , we have formula_208, and: 
formula_209

Now, since are roots of formula_210 and formula_211, we have formula_212, which means has at least roots. From Rolle&#x27;s theorem, formula_213 has at least roots, and iteratively formula_214 has at least one root in the interval . Thus:
formula_215

and:
formula_216

This parallels the reasoning behind the Lagrange remainder term in the Taylor theorem; in fact, the Taylor remainder is a special case of interpolation error when all interpolation nodes are identical. Note that the error will be zero when formula_217 for any &quot;i&quot;. Thus, the maximum error will occur at some point in the interval between two successive nodes.

===Equally spaced intervals===
In the case of equally spaced interpolation nodes where formula_218, for formula_219 and where formula_220 the product term in the interpolation error formula can be bound as
formula_221

Thus the error bound can be given as
formula_222

However, this assumes that formula_223 is dominated by formula_224, i.e. formula_225. In several cases, this is not true and the error actually increases as (see Runge&#x27;s phenomenon). That question is treated in the section &quot;Convergence properties&quot;.

==Lebesgue constants==
We fix the interpolation nodes &quot;x&quot;0, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; and an interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] containing all the interpolation nodes. The process of interpolation maps the function &quot;f&quot; to a polynomial &quot;p&quot;. This defines a mapping &quot;X&quot; from the space &quot;C&quot;([&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]) of all continuous functions on [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] to itself. The map &quot;X&quot; is linear and it is a projection on the subspace formula_226 of polynomials of degree &quot;n&quot; or less.

The Lebesgue constant &quot;L&quot; is defined as the operator norm of &quot;X&quot;. One has (a special case of Lebesgue&#x27;s lemma):
formula_227

In other words, the interpolation polynomial is at most a factor (&quot;L&quot; + 1) worse than the best possible approximation. This suggests that we look for a set of interpolation nodes that makes &quot;L&quot; small. In particular, we have for Chebyshev nodes:
formula_228

We conclude again that Chebyshev nodes are a very good choice for polynomial interpolation, as the growth in &quot;n&quot; is exponential for equidistant nodes. However, those nodes are not optimal.

==Convergence properties==
It is natural to ask, for which classes of functions and for which interpolation nodes the sequence of interpolating polynomials converges to the interpolated function as ? Convergence may be understood in different ways, e.g. pointwise, uniform or in some integral norm.

The situation is rather bad for equidistant nodes, in that uniform convergence is not even guaranteed for infinitely differentiable functions. One classical example, due to Carl Runge, is the function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 1 / (1 + &quot;x&quot;2) on the interval . The interpolation error grows without bound as . Another example is the function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = |&quot;x&quot;| on the interval , for which the interpolating polynomials do not even converge pointwise except at the three points &quot;x&quot; = ±1, 0.

One might think that better convergence properties may be obtained by choosing different interpolation nodes. The following result seems to give a rather encouraging answer:

The defect of this method, however, is that interpolation nodes should be calculated anew for each new function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), but the algorithm is hard to be implemented numerically. Does there exist a single table of nodes for which the sequence of interpolating polynomials converge to any continuous function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)? The answer is unfortunately negative:

The proof essentially uses the lower bound estimation of the Lebesgue constant, which we defined above to be the operator norm of &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; (where &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the projection operator on Π&quot;n&quot;). Now we seek a table of nodes for which

formula_229

Due to the Banach–Steinhaus theorem, this is only possible when norms of &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; are uniformly bounded, which cannot be true since we know that

formula_230

For example, if equidistant points are chosen as interpolation nodes, the function from Runge&#x27;s phenomenon demonstrates divergence of such interpolation. Note that this function is not only continuous but even infinitely differentiable on . For better Chebyshev nodes, however, such an example is much harder to find due to the following result:

==Related concepts==
Runge&#x27;s phenomenon shows that for high values of , the interpolation polynomial may oscillate wildly between the data points. This problem is commonly resolved by the use of spline interpolation. Here, the interpolant is not a polynomial but a spline: a chain of several polynomials of a lower degree.

Interpolation of periodic functions by harmonic functions is accomplished by Fourier transform. This can be seen as a form of polynomial interpolation with harmonic base functions, see trigonometric interpolation and trigonometric polynomial.

Hermite interpolation problems are those where not only the values of the polynomial &quot;p&quot; at the nodes are given, but also all derivatives up to a given order. This turns out to be equivalent to a system of simultaneous polynomial congruences, and may be solved by means of the Chinese remainder theorem for polynomials. Birkhoff interpolation is a further generalization where only derivatives of some orders are prescribed, not necessarily all orders from 0 to a &quot;k&quot;.

Collocation methods for the solution of differential and integral equations are based on polynomial interpolation.

The technique of rational function modeling is a generalization that considers ratios of polynomial functions.

At last, multivariate interpolation for higher dimensions.

<text>The Durand Line (; ; ), also known as the Afghanistan–Pakistan border, is a international border between Afghanistan and Pakistan in South Asia. The western end runs to the border with Iran and the eastern end to the border with China.

The Durand Line was established in 1893 as the international border between the Emirate of Afghanistan and the British Indian Empire by Mortimer Durand, a British diplomat of the Indian Civil Service, and Abdur Rahman Khan, the Emir of Afghanistan, to fix the limit of their respective spheres of influence and improve diplomatic relations and trade. Britain considered Afghanistan to be an independent state at the time, although they controlled its foreign affairs and diplomatic relations.

The single-page Agreement, dated 12 November 1893, contains seven short articles, including a commitment not to exercise interference beyond the Durand Line. A joint British-Afghan demarcation survey took place starting from 1894, covering some of the border. Established towards the end of the British–Russian &quot;Great Game&quot; rivalry, the resulting line established Afghanistan as a buffer zone between British and Russian interests in the region. The line, as slightly modified by the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919, was inherited by Pakistan in 1947, following its independence.

The Durand line cuts through to demarcate Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, and the contested region of Gilgit-Baltistan of northern and western Pakistan from the northeastern and southern provinces of Afghanistan. From a geopolitical and geostrategic perspective, it has been described as one of the most dangerous borders in the world.

Although the Durand Line is internationally recognized as the western border of Pakistan, it remains largely unrecognized in Afghanistan. Sardar Mohammed Daoud Khan, former prime minister and president of Afghanistan, vigorously opposed the border and launched a propaganda war – however during his visit to Pakistan in August 1976 he softened his tone by recognising the Durand line as the border. In 2017, amid cross-border tensions, former Afghan President Hamid Karzai said that Afghanistan will &quot;never recognise&quot; the Durand Line as the border between the two countries.

== Historical background ==


The area through which the Durand Line runs has been inhabited by the indigenous Pashtuns since ancient times, at least since 500 BC. The Greek historian Herodotus mentioned a people called &quot;Pactyans&quot; living in and around Arachosia as early as the 1st millennium BC. The Baloch tribes inhabit the southern end of the line, which runs in the Balochistan region that separates the ethnic Baloch people.

Arab Muslims conquered the area in the 7th century and introduced Islam to the Pashtuns. It is believed that some of the early Arabs also settled among the Pashtuns in the Sulaiman Mountains. These Pashtuns were historically known as &quot;Afghans&quot; and are believed to be mentioned by that name in Arabic chronicles as early as the 10th century. The Pashtun area (known today as the &quot;Pashtunistan&quot; region) fell within the Ghaznavid Empire in the 10th century followed by the Ghurids, Timurids, Mughals, Hotakis, by the Durranis, and thereafter the Sikhs.

In 1839, during the First Anglo-Afghan War, British-led Indian forces invaded Afghanistan and initiated a war with the Afghan rulers. Two years later, in 1842, the British were defeated and the war ended. The British again invaded Afghanistan in 1878, during the Second Anglo-Afghan War. The British decided to accept a new Amir who was a British opponent – Abdur Rahman Khan and the Treaty of Gandamak was signed in 1880. Afghanistan ceded control of various frontier areas to India. The British failed in their objective to maintain a British resident in Kabul but having attained their other geopolitical objectives, the British withdrew.

In 1893, Mortimer Durand was dispatched to Kabul by the Government of India to sign an agreement with Amir Abdur Rahman Khan for fixing the limits of their respective spheres of influence as well as improving diplomatic relations and trade. On 12 November 1893, the Durand Line Agreement was reached. The two parties later camped at Parachinar, a small town near Khost in Afghanistan, which is now part of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of Pakistan, to delineate the frontier.

From the British-Indian side, the camp was attended by Mortimer Durand and Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum, Political Agent Khyber Agency representing the Viceroy of India and Governor General of India. The Afghan side was represented by Sahibzada Abdul Latif and a former governor of Khost Province in Afghanistan, Sardar Shireendil Khan, representing Amir Abdur Rahman Khan. The original 1893 Durand Line Agreement was written in English, with translated copies in Dari.

The resulting agreement or treaty led to the creation of a new province called the North-West Frontier Province, now known as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province of Pakistan which includes FATA and the Frontier Regions. It also led to Afghanistan receiving Nuristan and Wakhan.

=== Demarcation surveys on the Durand Line ===
The initial and primary demarcation, a joint Indo-Afghan survey and mapping effort, covered and took place from 1894 to 1896. Detailed topographic maps locating hundreds of boundary demarcation pillars were soon published and are available in the Survey of India collection at the British Library.

The complete 20-page text of these detailed joint Indo-Afghan demarcation surveys is available in several sources.

In 1896, the long stretch from the Kabul River to China, including the Wakhan Corridor, was declared demarcated by virtue of its continuous, distinct watershed ridgeline, leaving only the section near the Khyber Pass to be finally demarcated in the treaty of 22 November 1921, signed by Mahmud Tarzi, &quot;Chief of the Afghan Government for the conclusion of the treaty&quot; and &quot;Henry R. C. Dobbs, Envoy Extraordinary and Chief of the British Mission to Kabul.&quot;
A very short adjustment to the demarcation was made at Arundu (Arnawai) in 1933–34.

===Cultural impact of the Durand Line===

Shortly after demarcation of the Durand Line, the British began connecting the region on their side of the Durand Line to the North Western State Railway. Meanwhile, Abdur Rahman Khan conquered the Nuristanis and made them Muslims. Concurrently, Afridi tribesmen began rising up in arms against the British, creating a zone of instability between Peshawar and the Durand Line. Further, frequent skirmishes and wars between the Afghanistan and India starting in the 1870s made travel between Peshawar and Jalalabad almost impossible. As a result, travel across the boundary was almost entirely halted. Further, the British recruited tens of thousands of local Pashtuns into the Indian Army and stationed them throughout India and southeast Asia. Exposure to India, combined with the ease of travel eastwards into Punjab and the difficulty of travel towards Afghanistan, led many Pashtuns to orient themselves towards the heartlands of British India and away from Kabul. By the time of Indian independence, political opinion was divided into those who supported a homeland for Muslim Indians in the shape of Pakistan, those who supported reunification with Afghanistan, and those who believed that a united India would be a better option.

=== British Raj declares war on Afghanistan ===
The Durand Line triggered a long-running controversy between the governments of Afghanistan and British India, especially after the outbreak of the Third Anglo-Afghan War when Afghanistan&#x27;s capital (Kabul) and its eastern city of Jalalabad were bombed by the No. 31 and No. 114 Squadrons of the British Royal Air Force in May 1919. Afghan rulers reaffirmed in the 1919, 1921, and 1930 treaties to accept the Indo-Afghan frontier.

=== Territorial dispute between Afghanistan and British India ===

Pakistan inherited the 1893 agreement and the subsequent 1919 Treaty of Rawalpindi after the partition from the British India in 1947. There has never been a formal agreement or ratification between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan believes, and international convention under uti possidetis juris supports, the position that it should not require an agreement to set the boundary; courts in several countries around the world and the Vienna Convention have universally upheld via &quot;uti possidetis juris&quot; that binding bilateral agreements are &quot;passed down&quot; to successor states. Thus, a unilateral declaration by one party has no effect; boundary changes must be made bilaterally.

At the time of independence, the indigenous Pashtun people living on the border with Afghanistan were given only the choice of becoming a part either of India or Pakistan. Further, by the time of the Indian independence movement, prominent Pashtun nationalists such as Abdul Ghaffar Khan and his Khudai Khidmatgar movement advocated a united India, and not a united Afghanistan – highlighting the extent to which infrastructure and instability together began to erode Pashtun self-identification with Afghanistan. By the time of independence, popular opinion amongst Pashtuns was split amongst the majority who wished to join the newly formed state of Pakistan, and the minority who wished to become a part of the Dominion of India. When the idea of a united India failed, Ghaffar Khan pledged allegiance to Pakistan and started campaigning for the autonomy of Pakistan&#x27;s Pashtuns.

On 26 July 1949, when Afghan–Pakistan relations were rapidly deteriorating, a loya jirga was held in Afghanistan after a military aircraft from the Pakistan Air Force bombed a village on the Afghan side of the Durand Line in response to cross-border fire from the Afghan side. In response, the Afghan government declared that it recognised &quot;neither the imaginary Durand nor any similar line&quot; and that all previous Durand Line agreements were void. They also announced that the Durand ethnic division line had been imposed on them under coercion/duress and was a diktat. This had no tangible effect as there has never been a move in the United Nations to enforce such a declaration due to both nations being constantly busy in wars with their other neighbours (See &quot;Indo-Pakistani wars and Civil war in Afghanistan&quot;). In 1950 the House of Commons of the United Kingdom held its view on the Afghan-Pakistan dispute over the Durand Line by stating:

At the 1956 SEATO (Southeast Asia Treaty Organization) Ministerial Council Meeting held at Karachi, capital of Pakistan at the time, it was stated:

In 1976, the then president of Afghanistan, Sardar Mohammed Daoud Khan recognised Durand Line as international border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. He made this declaration while he was on an official visit to Islamabad, Pakistan.

==Geography==

The border is south of the Hindu Kush, while its eastern end by China is in the Karakoram range. These are regions of extreme high elevation, hence much of the Durand Line is bounded by mountains. The Spīn Ghar (&quot;White Mountains&quot;) range is roughly in the middle of the Line. The western part of the Line meanwhile is lower and sparse, consisting of the Registan Desert.
The highest peak, Noshaq, is located along the border between two countries, while some of the highest peaks in the world, including K2, are a short distance to the east of the Line&#x27;s end on the Pakistani side.

The Kunar River, Kabul River, Kurram River and Gomal River all cross the Durand Line. At the very western end of the line is the Godzareh Depression.

==Border regions==
The border is long. Twelve Afghan provinces are located along the border: Nimroz, Helmand, Kandahar, Zabul, Paktika, Khost, Paktia, Logar, Nangarhar, Kunar, Nuristan and Badakhshan.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, and the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan share a border with the Durand Line.

==Border crossings and economy==

The two countries are major trade partners, and therefore the various border crossings are economically important for the wider region, particularly the Torkham and Khyber Pass that is also the main land connection between Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent.

== Contemporary era ==

During Operation Cyclone, the ISI, with support and funding from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States, recruited mujahideen militant groups on the Pakistani side of the Durand line to cross into Afghanistan&#x27;s territory for missions to topple the Soviet-backed Afghan government. Afghanistan KHAD was one of two secret service agencies believed to have been conducting bombings in parts of the North West Frontier (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) during the early 1980s. U.S State Department blamed WAD (a KGB-created Afghan secret intelligence agency) for terrorist bombings in Pakistan&#x27;s cities in 1987 and 1988. It is also believed that Afghanistan&#x27;s PDPA government supported the leftist Al-Zulfiqar organization of Pakistan, the group accused of the 1981 hijacking of a Pakistan International Airlines plane from Karachi to Kabul.
After the collapse of the pro-Soviet Afghan government in 1992, Pakistan, despite Article 2 of the Durand Line Agreement which states &quot;The Government of India will at no time exercise interference in the territories lying beyond this line on the side of Afghanistan&quot;, attempted to create a puppet state in Afghanistan prior to Taliban control according to US Special Envoy on Afghanistan Peter Tomsen. According to a summer 2001 report in &quot;The Friday Times&quot;, even the Taliban leaders challenged the very existence of the Durand Line when former Afghan Interior Minister Abdur Razzaq and a delegation of about 95 Taliban visited Pakistan. The Taliban refused to endorse the Durand Line despite pressure from Islamabad, arguing that there shall be no borders among Muslims. When the Taliban government was removed in late 2001, the Afghan President Hamid Karzai also began resisting the Durand Line, and today the present Government of Afghanistan does not recognize Durand Line as its international border. No Afghan government has recognized the Durand Line as its border since 1947.

The Afghan Geodesy and Cartography Head Office (AGCHO) depicts the line on their maps as a de facto border, including naming the &quot;Durand Line 2310 km (1893)&quot; as an &quot;International Boundary Line&quot; on their home page. However, a map in an article from the Pashtun-dominated Government of Afghanistan not only refuses to recognise the Durand Line as the international border between the two countries, it claims that the Pashtun territories of Pakistan rightly belong to Afghanistan. The Durand Line Agreement makes no mention of a time limit, thus suggesting the treaty has no expiry date. In 2004, spokespersons of U.S. State Department&#x27;s Office of the Geographer and Global Issues and British Foreign and Commonwealth Office also pointed out that the Durand Line Agreement has no mention of an expiry date.

Because the Durand Line divides the Pashtun and Baloch people, it continues to be a source of tension between the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan. In August 2007, Pakistani politician and the leader of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, Fazal-ur-Rehman, urged Afghanistan to recognise the Durand Line. Press statements from 2005 to 2007 by former Pakistani President Musharraf calling for the building of a fence on the Durand Line have been met with resistance from numerous Pashtun political parties in Afghanistan. Pashtun politicians in Afghanistan strenuously object to even the existence of the Durand Line border. In 2006 Afghan President Hamid Karzai warned that &quot;Iran and Pakistan and others are not fooling anyone.&quot;

Aimal Faizi, spokesman for the Afghan President, stated in October 2012 that the Durand Line is &quot;an issue of historical importance for Afghanistan. The Afghan people, not the government, can take a final decision on it.&quot;

=== Recent border skirmishes ===
In July 2003, Pakistani and Afghan forces clashed over border posts. The Afghan government claimed that the Pakistani military established bases up to 600 meters inside Afghanistan in the Yaqubi area near bordering Mohmand District. The Yaqubi and Yaqubi Kandao (Pass) area were later found to fall within Afghanistan. In 2007, Pakistan erected fences and posts a few hundred metres inside Afghanistan near the border-straddling bazaar of Angoor Ada in South Waziristan, but the Afghan National Army quickly removed them and began shelling Pakistani positions. Leaders in Pakistan said the fencing was a way to prevent Taliban militants from crossing over between the two nations, but Afghan President Hamid Karzai believed that it is Islamabad&#x27;s plan to permanently separate the Pashtun tribes. Special Forces from the United States Army were based at Shkin, Afghanistan, seven kilometres west of Angoor Ada, from 2002. In 2009, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and American CIA began using unmanned aerial vehicles from the Afghan side to hit terrorist targets on the Pakistani side of the Durand Line.

The border area between Afghanistan and Pakistan has long been one of the most dangerous places in the world, due largely to very little government control. It is legal and common in the region to carry guns, and assault rifles and explosives are common. Many forms of illegal activities take place, such as smuggling of weapons, narcotics, lumber, copper, gemstones, marble, vehicles, and electronic products, as well as ordinary consumer goods. Kidnappings and murders are frequent.
Militants frequently cross the border from both sides to conduct attacks. In June 2011 more than 500 Taliban militants entered Upper Dir area from Afghanistan and killed more than 30 Pakistani security forces. Police said the attackers targeted a checkpost, destroyed two schools and several houses, while killing a number of civilians.

The governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan are both trying to extend the rule of law into the border areas. At the same time, the United States is reviewing the Reconstruction Opportunity Zones (ROZ) Act in Washington, D.C., which is supposed to help the economic status of the Pashtun and Baloch tribes by providing jobs to a large number of the population on both sides of the Durand Line border.

Much of the northern and central Durand line is quite mountainous, where crossing the border is often only practical in the numerous passes through the mountains. Border crossing is very common, especially among Pashtuns who cross to meet relatives or to work. The movement of people across the border has largely been unchecked or uncontrolled, although passports and visas are at times checked at official crossings. In June 2011 the United States installed a biometric system at the border crossing near Spin Boldak, aimed at improving the security situation and blocking the infiltration of insurgents into southern Afghanistan.

Throughout June and into July 2011, Pakistan Chitral Scouts and local defence militias suffered deadly cross-border raids. In response the Pakistani military shelled some Afghan villages in Afghanistan&#x27;s Nuristan, Kunar, Nangarhar, and Khost provinces resulting in a number of Afghan civilians being killed. Afghanistan&#x27;s Interior Ministry claimed that nearly 800 rockets were fired from Pakistan, hitting civilian targets inside Afghanistan. The Afghan statement claimed that attacks by Pakistan resulted in the deaths of 42 Afghan civilians, including 30 men and 12 women and girls, wounded 55 others and destroyed 120 homes. Although Pakistan claimed it was an accident and just routine anti-Taliban operations, some analysts believe that it could have been a show of strength by Islamabad. For example, a senior official at the Council on Foreign Relations explained that because the shelling was of such a large scale, it was more likely a warning from Pakistan than an accident.

The United States and other NATO states often ignored this sensitive issue, likely because of potential effects on their war strategy in Afghanistan. Their involvement could have strained relations and jeopardized their own national interests in the area. This came after the November 2011 NATO bombing in which 24 Pakistani soldiers were killed. In response to that incident, Pakistan decided to cut off all NATO supply lines as well as boost border security by installing anti-aircraft guns and radars to monitor air activity. Regarding the Durand Line, some rival maps are said to display discrepancies of as much as five kilometres.

===Trench being built alongside the border===
In June 2016, Pakistan announced that it had completed 1,100 km of trenches along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border (Durand Line) in Balochistan to check movement of terrorists and smugglers across border into Pakistan from Afghanistan. Plans to expand this trench/ berm/ fence work were announced in March 2017. The plans also included building 338 checkpoints and forts along the border by 2019.

===2017 border closure and reopening===
On 16 February, Pakistan closed the border crossings at Torkham and Chaman due to security reasons following the Sehwan blast. On 7 March, the border was reopened for two days to facilitate the return of people to their respective countries who had earlier crossed the border on valid visas. The decision was taken after repeated requests by Afghanistan&#x27;s government to avert &#x27;a humanitarian crisis&#x27;. According to a Pakistani official, 24,000 Afghans returned to Afghanistan, while 700 Pakistanis returned to Pakistan, before the border was indefinitely closed again. On 20 March, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ordered the reopening of Afghanistan–Pakistan border as a &quot;goodwill gesture&quot;, 32 days after it was closed.

On 5 May, following an attack on Pakistani census team by Afghan forces and the resulting exchange of fire between the two sides, the border was closed again.

Pakistan&#x27;s decision to close the border was to force Afghanistan to take action against militant groups who were using Afghanistan&#x27;s soil to carry out cross-border attacks against Pakistan. An Afghan diplomat at the World Trade Organization (WTO) claimed that Afghanistan suffered a loss of 90 million U.S. dollars as a result of closure of border by Pakistan. On 27 May 2017, Pakistan reopened the border after a request from Afghan authorities, marking the end of the border closure that lasted 22 days.

==Border barrier==

Pakistan has been constructing a border barrier since 2017 to prevent terrorism, drug trafficking, refugees, illegal immigration, smuggling and infiltration across the Durand Line. According to Pakistan the barrier is also necessary to block the infiltration of militants across the border. As of January 2019, 900 km has been completed. The Durand Line is marked by 235 crossing points, many of which had been susceptible to illegal immigration. The project is predicted to cost at least $532 million.

As of 21 January 2022 the interior minister of Pakistan stated that only 20 km of fencing remains and it will be completed soon.

<doc id="203574" wikidata="Q2008735" url="?curid=203574" title="Siwa Oasis">
<text>The Siwa Oasis ( ) is an urban oasis in Egypt. It is situated between the Qattara Depression and the Great Sand Sea in the Western Desert, east of the Egypt–Libya border and from the Egyptian capital city of Cairo. It is famed from its role in ancient Egypt as the home to an oracle of Amun, the ruins of which are a popular tourist attraction, giving it the ancient name Oasis of Amun-Ra, after the major Egyptian deity.

==Geography==
The Oasis is in a deep depression that reaches below sea level. To the west, the al Jaghbub Oasis rests in a similar depression and to the east, the large Qattara Depression is also below sea level. The depression is fertile due to both natural flowing artesian wells and irrigation. It is the site of about 200 natural springs. Siwa is directly adjacent to the Libyan Desert plateau. The geology is characterised by horizontal layers of porous limestones alternated with marls and clays dating back to the Miocene. The limestone plateau and inselbergs resulting from the oasis&#x27; erosion along the dunes create reliefs that the Isiwan describe as mountains (&quot;adrar&quot; in Tamizight). Two large salt lakes are fed by drainage water of agricultural origin. The oasis supports the cultivation of thousands of date palms and olives. Siwa has a temperate desert climate.

==Name==
The Ancient Egyptian name of the oasis was &quot;sḫt jꜣmw&quot;, meaning &quot;Field of Trees&quot;. The native Libyan toponym may be preserved in the Egyptian &quot;t̠ꜣ(j) n d̠rw &quot;tꜣj&quot; on the fringe&quot; where &quot;t̠ꜣ&quot; transcribed the local Palaeo-Berber name &quot;*Se&quot; or &quot;*Sa&quot;. This name survived in the works of Muslim geographers as &quot;Santariyyah.&quot; 

Siwah is the Arabic name of the oasis called &quot;Sali&quot; in Berber. The oasis is also called &quot;Isiwan&quot; in modern Berber. 

The etymology of the word سيوة Siwah is unclear. Champollion derives it from Coptic ⲥⲟⲟⲩϩ (soouh) – a corruption of Egyptian word for &quot;oasis&quot;, ⲟⲩⲁϩ (ouoh). The additional evidence of the Egyptian source of Siwa&#x27;s name is another place name in Kharga Oasis that may share the same etymology – &quot;S.t-wȝḥ,&quot; modern Deir el-Hagar). Basset links it to a Berber tribal name &quot;swh&quot; attested further west in the early Islamic period, while Ilahiane, following Chafik, links it to the Shilha Berber word &quot;asiwan&quot;, a type of bird of prey, and hence to Amun-Ra, one of whose symbols was the falcon. Some classical authors referred to the site as &quot;Ammonium&quot;. 

==History==


Although the site is known to have been settled since at least the 10th millennium BCE, the earliest evidence of any connection with Ancient Egypt is the 26th Dynasty, when a necropolis was established. Ancient Greek settlers at Cyrene made contact with the oasis around the same time (7th century BCE), and the oracle temple of Amun (Greek: &quot;Zeus Ammon&quot;), who, Herodotus was told, took the image here of a ram. Herodotus knew of a &quot;fountain of the Sun&quot; that ran coldest in the noontime heat. During his campaign to conquer the Persian Empire, Alexander the Great reached the oasis, supposedly by following birds across the desert. The oracle, Alexander&#x27;s court historians alleged, confirmed him as both a divine personage and the legitimate Pharaoh of Egypt, though Alexander&#x27;s motives in making the excursion, following his founding of Alexandria, remain to some extent inscrutable and contested. During the Ptolemaic Kingdom, its Ancient Egyptian name was &quot;sḫ.t-ỉm3w&quot;, meaning &quot;Field of Trees&quot;.

In the 12th century, Al-Idrisi mentions it as being inhabited mainly by Berbers, with an Arab minority; a century before Al-Bakri stated that only Berbers lived there. The Egyptian historian Al-Maqrizi traveled to Siwa in the 15th century and described how the language spoken there &#x27;is similar to the language of the Zenata&#x27;.

The first European to document a visit since Roman times was the English traveler William George Browne, who came in 1792 to see the ancient temple of the Oracle of Amun. Bompiani, in her description of the 19th-century explorer Luigi Robecchi Bricchetti, called this site the &quot;Oasis of Jupiter Ammon&quot;.

Siwa was annexed by Muhammad Ali of Egypt in 1820, but the Egyptian representative in Siwa was assassinated in 1838. At some point, Muhammad al-Sanusi stayed at Siwa for a few months and gathered some followers there. Later, Siwa was a base of the Sanusiyya in their fight against the British from 1915 to 1917. Meanwhile, in the spring of 1893, German explorer and photographer Hermann Burchardt took photographs of the architecture of the town of Siwa, now stored at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin.

Egyptian rule from distant Cairo was at first tenuous and marked by several revolts. Egypt began to assert firmer control after a 1928 visit to the Oasis by King Fuad I, who berated the locals for homosexual practices and specified punishments to bring Siwan behaviour in line with Egyptian morals.

Siwa was also the site of some fighting during World War I and World War II. The British Army&#x27;s Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) was based here, but Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps also took possession three times. German soldiers went skinny dipping in the lake of the oracle, contrary to local customs which prohibit public nudity. In 1942, while the Italian 136th Infantry Division Giovani Fascisti occupied the oasis, a tiny Egyptian puppet government-in-exile was set up at Siwa. The oasis makes a brief appearance as a base of the LRDG in the 1958 war film &quot;Ice Cold in Alex&quot;.

The ancient fortress of Siwa, known as the Shali Ghadi (&quot;Shali&quot; being the name of the town, and &quot;Ghadi&quot; meaning &quot;remote&quot;), was built on natural rock (an inselberg) and made of kershif (salt and mud-brick) and palm logs. After it was damaged by three days of heavy rains in 1926 it was abandoned for similar unreinforced construction housing on the plain surrounding it, and in some cases those, in turn, have been replaced by more modern cinder block and sheet metal roof buildings. Only one building in the Shali complex has been repaired and is in use, a mosque. Gradually eroded by infrequent rains and slowly collapsing, the Shali remains a prominent feature, towering five stories above the modern town and lit at night by floodlights. It is most easily approached from its southwest side, south of the end of the paved road which curves around from the north side of the Shali. Several uneven pedestrian streets lead from the southwest end of the Shali into it, and the ground is rent in places by deep cracks. Many of the unreinforced kershif buildings bordering the streets of the Shali are also split by large cracks, or they are partially collapsed.

Other local historic sites of interest include the remains of the oracle temple; the Gebel al Mawta (the Mountain of the Dead), a Roman-era necropolis featuring dozens of rock-cut tombs; and &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s Bath&quot;, an antique natural spring. The fragmentary remains of the oracle temple, with some inscriptions dating from the 4th century BCE, lie within the ruins of Aghurmi. The revelations of the oracle fell into disrepute under the Roman occupation of Egypt.

Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh), as the rest of Egypt.
==Culture==

The traditional culture of Siwa shows many unique elements, some reflecting its longstanding links with the isolated Oasis life and the fact that the inhabitants are Siwi Berbers. Until a tarmac road was built to the Mediterranean coast in the 1980s Siwa&#x27;s only links with the outside world were by arduous camel tracks through the desert. These were used to export dates and olives, bring trade goods, or carry pilgrims on the route which linked the Maghreb to Cairo and hence to Mecca.
As a result of this isolation, Siwis developed a unique natural culture manifested in its crafts of basketry, pottery, silverwork and embroidery and in its style of dress. The most visible and celebrated examples of this were the bridal silver and the ensemble of silver ornaments and beads that women wore in abundance to weddings and other ceremonies. These pieces were decorated with symbols which related to Siwa&#x27;s history and beliefs and attitudes.

The best known of these pieces is a huge silver disc called &#x27;&quot;adrim&quot;&#x27; and a round necklace, called &quot;&#x27;aghraw&#x27;,&quot; from which it hung over the breast. A girl would give up the disc at a special ceremony in the spring the day she was married. The jewelry, which was made by local silversmiths, consisted of silver necklaces, earrings, bangles, hair ornaments, pendants, and many rings. For a wealthy woman, the full ensemble could weigh as much as five or six kilos. These pieces are decorated with symbols common to Berber people across North Africa designed to promote good health, fertility and to protect the wearer from misfortune. Some of the same signs and patterns are found on the embroidery which embellishes women&#x27;s dresses, trousers, and shawls.

==Art and local customs==

The arrival of the road and of television exposed the oasis to the styles and fashions of the outside world and the traditional silver ornaments were gradually replaced by jewelry made of gold. Evidence of the old styles and traditions are however still in evidence in the women&#x27;s embroidery and costume. The material for the &quot;tarfutet&quot;, the distinctive all-enveloping shawl worn by women, are brought from outside the oasis, specifically from the town of Kirdasa, in the Giza Governorate.

===Festivals===
Siwi people are very religious so on Ramadan, they tend to close all the shops and stay at home for the whole month. Like other Muslim Egyptians, Siwis celebrate Eid al-Fitr (&quot;lʕid ahakkik&quot;,&quot;the Little Eid&quot;) and Eid al-Adha (&quot;lʕid azuwwar&quot;,&quot;the Big Eid&quot;). Unlike other Egyptians, however, on Eid al-Adha Siwis cook the skin of the sheep (along with its innards) as a festival delicacy, after removing the hair. They also eat heart of palm (&quot;agroz&quot;).

The Siyaha Festival (Eid El Solh–Eid El Hasad), in honour of the town&#x27;s traditional patron saint Sidi Sulayman, is unique to Siwa (the name is often misunderstood as a reference to &quot;tourism&quot;, but in fact predates tourism). It is known that on this occasion Siwi men meet on a mountain near the town, Gabal Al–Dakrour, to eat together, sing chants while thanking God, and reconcile with one another; all Siwi houses co-operate in preparing and cooking food, in this day Siwian people eat fattah (rice, toasted bread and meat), after Dohr prayer (12:00 PM) all Siwian youth gather to set the banquet, nobody is allowed to eat before the caller announces to start eating so they can all eat together, the women stay behind in the village, and celebrate with dancing, singing, and drums. The food for the festival is bought collectively, with funds gathered by the oasis&#x27; mosques, celebrations last for 3 Qamari days, and in the early morning of the fourth day, siwian men form a big march, while holding flags and singing spiritual songs. The march starts from Gabal El – Dakrour and ends in Sidi Solayman square – in the center of Siwa – declaring ending of festivals, and beginning of a new year without hatred or grudge, and with love, respect and reconciliation.

Siwi children traditionally also celebrated Ashura by lighting torches, singing, and exchanging sweets. Adults&#x27; celebration was limited to the preparation of a large meal.

===Relations with the Bedouins===

Siwans are preferentially endogamous, only rarely marrying non-Siwans. Nonetheless, Bedouin brides command a higher brideprice in Siwa than Siwan ones.

According to older members of the &quot;Awlad Ali&quot; Bedouins, the Bedouin relations with Siwans were traditionally mediated through a system of &quot;friendship&quot;, whereby a specific Siwan (and his descendants) would be the friend of a specific Bedouin (and his descendants). The Bedouin would stay at the Siwan&#x27;s house when he came to Siwa, and would exchange his animal products and grain for the Siwan&#x27;s dates and olive oil.

Siwa&#x27;s Berbers are close to 30,000 in number.

The hot springs are an attraction to visitors.

===Role of women===
Women have traditionally played a prominent role in Siwan households, often being in charge of a household&#x27;s financial decisions. They have also been responsible for raising children; the town&#x27;s deputy mayor said in 1985, &quot;If our children speak Siwi, it to our womenfolk that they owe it.&quot;

===Siwan pederastic tradition===

Siwa is of special interest to anthropologists and sociologists because of its historical acceptance of intergenerational male homosexuality and rituals celebrating same-sex marriage – traditions that the Egyptian authorities have sought to repress, with increasing success, since the early 20th century.

The German Egyptologist Georg Steindorff explored the Oasis in 1900 and reported that pederastic relations were common and often extended to a form of marriage: &quot;The feast of marrying a boy was celebrated with great pomp, and the money paid for a boy sometimes amounted to fifteen pounds, while the money paid for a woman was a little over one pound.&quot; Mahmud Mohammad Abd Allah, writing of Siwan customs for the Harvard Peabody Museum in 1917, commented that although Siwan men could take up to four wives, &quot;Siwan customs allow a man but one boy to whom he is bound by a stringent code of obligations.&quot;

In 1937, the anthropologist Walter Cline wrote the first detailed ethnography of the Siwans in which he noted: &quot;All normal Siwan men and boys practice sodomy...among themselves the natives are not ashamed of this; they talk about it as openly as they talk about love of women, and many if not most of their fights arise from homosexual competition...Prominent men lend their sons to each other. All Siwans know the matings which have taken place among their sheiks and their sheiks&#x27; sons...Most of the boys used in sodomy are between 12 and 18 years of age.&quot; After an expedition to Siwa, the archaeologist Count Byron de Prorok reported in 1937 &quot;an enthusiasm [that] could not have been approached even in Sodom... Homosexuality was not merely rampant, it was raging...Every dancer had his boyfriend...[and] chiefs had harems of boys&quot;.

In the late 1940s, a Siwan merchant told the visiting British novelist Robin Maugham that the Siwan women were &quot;badly neglected&quot;, but that Siwan men &quot;will kill each other for boy. Never for a woman&quot;, although as Maugham noted, marriage to a boy had become illegal by then. The Egyptian archaeologist Ahmed Fakhry, who studied Siwa for three decades, observed in 1973 that &quot;While the Siwans were still living inside their walled town, none of these bachelors was allowed to spend the night in the town and had to sleep outside the gates...Under such circumstances it is not surprising that homosexuality was common among them...Up to the year 1928, it was not unusual that some kind of written agreement, which was sometimes called a marriage contract, was made between two males; but since the visit of King Fu&#x27;ad to this oasis it has been completely forbidden...However, such agreements continued, but in great secrecy, and without the actual writing, until the end of World War II. Now the practice is not followed.&quot;

Despite the multiplicity of sources for these practices, the Egyptian authorities and even the Siwan tribal elders have attempted to repress the historical and anthropological record. When the Siwa-born anthropologist Fathi Malim included reference to Siwan homosexuality (especially a love poem from a man to a youth) in his book &quot;Oasis Siwa&quot; (2001), the tribal council demanded that he blank out the material in the current edition of the book and remove it from future editions, or be expelled from the community. Malim reluctantly agreed and physically deleted the passages in the first edition of his book, and excluded them from the second. A newer book, &quot;Siwa Past and Present&quot; (2005) by A. Dumairy, the Director of Siwa Antiquities, discreetly omits all mention of the famous historical practices of the inhabitants.

==People==
About 80 km (50 mi) in length and 20 km (12 mi) wide, Siwa Oasis is one of Egypt&#x27;s most isolated settlements, with about 25,000 people, mostly Siwi Berbers (. The municipality hosts the easternmost Berber-speaking community, whose language, called Siwi (), shares many linguistic features with the languages of Sokna and El Foqaha in Libya, partially also with the Zenati group, and which has been heavily influenced by Arabic.

While the majority of the population of Siwa is Berber, the oasis is also home to a Bedouin community related to the Awlad Ali, the Shahibaat, as well as to a growing number of other Egyptian settlers. Currently, the entire population of the oasis speaks Arabic as either a first or a second language. The Siwi Berber population is also fluent in Egyptian Arabic, which is called &quot;Masri&quot; &quot;Egyptian&quot;.

==Economy==

Siwa has been noted for its dates since ancient times, and today date palm cultivation is by far the largest component of its economy. In a distant second place, with about one-fifth of the scale as dates, is olive cultivation. Handicrafts like basketry are also of regional importance.

Tourism has in recent decades become a vital source of income. Much attention has been given to creating hotels that use local materials and display local styles.

==Archaeology==

In the mid-20th century, Egyptian archaeologist Ahmed Fakhry worked at Siwa (and elsewhere in the Western Desert).

In 1995, Greek archaeologist Liana Souvaltzi announced that she had identified the tomb of Alexander the Great in the oasis of Siwa. She made the following statement to the Greek media:
But I am speaking to every Greek all over the world. I want every one of you to feel proud because Greek hands have found this very important monument.
This statement was an answer to the, at the time, Greek prime minister Costas Simitis who urged the archaeologists to stop their research in Egypt and sent a Greek Embassy advisor to ask the Egyptian government to withdraw Mrs Souvaltzi’s permission to excavate in the area. This was the first time in human history that one country&#x27;s government intervened in another country&#x27;s internal affairs to stop an archaeological excavation. The case is still active in the Greek courts of law.

An extremely old hominid footprint was discovered in 2007 at Siwa Oasis. Egyptian scientists claimed it could be 2–3 million years old, which would make it the oldest fossilized hominid footprint ever found. However, no proof of this conjecture was ever presented.

In late 2013, an announcement was made regarding the apparent Archaeoastronomy discovery of precise spring and fall Equinox sunrise alignments over the Aghurmi mound/Amun Oracle when viewed from Timasirayn temple in the Western Desert, 12 km away across Lake Siwa. The first known recent public viewing of this event occurred on March 21, 2014, during the spring Equinox.

==In popular culture==
Siwa Oasis is an official map for &quot;&quot; which belongs to North Africa Campaign. The fifth mission from the game &quot;Sniper Elite III&quot; takes place on the Siwa Oasis. Siwa is prominently featured in the videogame &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Origins&quot; and is the birthplace and home of the protagonist Bayek of Siwa. In British author Anthony Horowitz&#x27;s &quot;Alex Rider&quot; series, the ninth and eleventh instalments &quot;Scorpia Rising&quot; and &quot;Never Say Die&quot; feature Siwa. In Australian author Matthew Reilly&#x27;s &quot;Jack West&quot; series of seven novels starting with &quot;Seven Ancient Wonders&quot; feature prominently the Oracle of Siwa.

<text>The &quot;Northampton&quot;-class cruisers were a group of six heavy cruisers built for the United States Navy, and commissioned between 1928 and 1931.

The &quot;Northampton&quot;s saw much action in World War II. Three (&quot;Northampton&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot;, and &quot;Houston&quot;) were lost during the war. The other three were decommissioned soon after the end of the war, and scrapped in 1959–1961.

==Design==
The design of the ships was heavily influenced by the Washington Naval Treaty, which limited cruisers to a maximum of 10,000 tons displacement and a maximum main battery caliber of . The &quot;Northampton&quot;s were a reaction to the weight and cost of the immediately preceding , differing in several ways. The &quot;Pensacola&quot;s mounted a main battery of 10 guns in four turrets, a twin and superfiring triple fore and aft. In contrast, the &quot;Northampton&quot;s mounted 9 guns in three triple turrets, two forward and one aft, the layout followed in all subsequent U.S. heavy cruisers.

Although armor was increased, the &quot;Northampton&quot;s turned out to be lighter than the &quot;Pensacola&quot;s, and nearly 1,000 tons below the treaty limitations. Freeboard was increased in the &quot;Northampton&quot;s by adopting a high forecastle, which was extended aft in the last three for use as flagships. These ships were also the first U.S. ships to adopt a hangar for aircraft, and bunks instead of hammocks. Their lighter-than-expected weight caused them to roll excessively, which necessitated the fitting of deep bilge keels. The immediately-following was essentially a modified &quot;Northampton&quot;.

<doc id="203582" wikidata="Q207499" url="?curid=203582" title="Syagrius">
<text>Syagrius (c. 430 – 486 or 487 or 493–4) was a Roman general and the last ruler of a Western Roman rump state in northern Gaul, now called the Kingdom of Soissons. Gregory of Tours referred to him as King of the Romans. Syagrius&#x27;s defeat by King of the Franks Clovis I is considered the end of Western Roman rule outside of Italy. He inherited his position from his father, Aegidius, the last Roman &quot;magister militum per Gallias&quot;. Syagrius preserved his father&#x27;s territory between the Somme and the Loire around Soissons after the collapse of central rule in the Western Empire, a domain Gregory of Tours called the &quot;Kingdom&quot; of Soissons. Syagrius governed this Gallo-Roman enclave from the death of his father in 464 until 486, when he was defeated in battle by Clovis I.

Historians have mistrusted the title &quot;Rex Romanorum&quot; that Gregory of Tours gave him, at least as early as Godefroid Kurth, who dismissed it as a gross error in 1893. The common consensus has been to follow Kurth, based on the historical truism that Romans hated kingship from the days of the expulsion of Tarquin the Proud; for example, Syagrius&#x27;s article in the &quot;Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire&quot; omits this title, preferring to refer to him as a &quot;Roman ruler (in North Gaul)&quot;. However, Steven Fanning has assembled a number of examples of &quot;rex&quot; being used in a neutral, if not favorable, context, and argues that &quot;the phrase &quot;Romanorum rex&quot; is not peculiar to Gregory of Tours or to Frankish sources&quot;, and that Gregory&#x27;s usage may indeed show &quot;that they were, or were seen to be, claiming to be Roman emperors.&quot;

==End of Roman Gaul==
Despite being isolated from the surviving portions of the Roman Empire, Syagrius managed to maintain a degree of Roman authority in northern Gaul for twenty years, and his state outlived the end of the Western Empire itself, the last Emperors being overthrown or killed in 476 and 480. Syagrius managed to hold off the neighboring Salian Franks, who were internally divided under kings including Childeric. However, it is known that Childeric had previously come to the aid of the Gallo-Romans, joining a certain officer named Paul in operations against Saxons who at one point seized Angers.

Upon Childeric&#x27;s death in 481 his son Clovis succeeded him. While Childeric had seen no need to overthrow the last Roman foothold in the west, Clovis assembled an army, issued a challenge, and met Syagrius&#x27;s forces. Few details are known of the subsequent clash, the Battle of Soissons, but Syagrius was decisively defeated and fled. His domain passed to the Franks.

As Edward Gibbon later wrote, &quot;It would be ungenerous, without some more accurate knowledge of his strength and resources, to condemn the rapid flight of Syagrius, who escaped after the loss of a battle to the distant court of Toulouse.&quot; Toulouse was the capital of Alaric II, king of the Visigoths. Intimidated by the victorious Franks, the Visigoths imprisoned Syagrius, then surrendered him to Clovis. He died not long after, stabbed in secret according to Gregory of Tours.

==Descendants==
Despite the assassination of Syagrius, the family evidently prospered under Frankish rule. King Guntram sent a Count Syagrius on a diplomatic mission to the Byzantine Empire in 585. A member of the family, Syagria, made a large donation of land to the monks of Novalesa Abbey in 739. &quot;The last known member of the Syagrii was an abbot of Nantua who was mentioned in 757.&quot;

<text>The North Sea Jazz Festival is a festival held annually on the second weekend of July in the Netherlands at the Ahoy venue. The festival moved to Rotterdam in 2006 after the demolition of the Statenhal in The Hague where it was originally held. As of 3 November 2017, the festival is officially known as the NN North Sea Jazz Festival.

== Biography ==

The founder of the three-day festival was Paul Acket, a businessman and jazz lover who made a fortune in the 1960s with his pop magazine publishing company. When Acket sold his company in 1975, he was able to start and sponsor the North Sea Jazz Festival. Acket wanted to present American jazz and European avant-garde jazz. In 1976 the first edition of the festival took place. It was an immediate success: six stages, thirty hours of music, and 300 performances drew over 9000 visitors. Acts included Count Basie, James Brown, Miles Davis, Billy Eckstine, Stan Getz, Dizzy Gillespie, James Taylor, Benny Goodman, and Sarah Vaughan among others.

The Edison Jazz Awards and the Bird Awards are presented at the North Sea Jazz Festival.

In 1990, two sub-festivals were introduced: North Sea Jazz Heats, a free festival performed in pubs throughout The Hague, and the more exclusive Midsummer Jazz Gala. Both take place on the evening before the festival. Musicians that have performed at the Midsummer Jazz Gala include Tony Bennett, Herbie Hancock, and Oscar Peterson. Amy Winehouse performed at the festival in 2004 and Adele performed in 2009. Luis Miguel performed in the 2013 edition held in Curacao.

The festival has grown to fifteen stages, 1,200 musicians, and about 25,000 visitors a day. The festival presents concerts in New Orleans jazz, swing, fusion, blues, gospel, funk, soul and drum and bass.

The festival is acknowledged as the &quot;biggest indoor jazz festival in the world&quot; and has a reputation for showcasing different areas of jazz from all eras.

<doc id="203584" wikidata="Q7143294" url="?curid=203584" title="Pat Clayton">
<text>Patrick Andrew Clayton DSO MBE (16 April 1896 – 17 March 1962) was a British surveyor and soldier. He was the basis for the character of Peter Madox in &quot;The English Patient&quot;.

==Career==
Clayton was born in Croydon, London, in April 1896 and, after serving as an officer with the Royal Field Artillery of the British Army during World War I, spent nearly 20 years with the Egyptian Survey department during the 1920s and 1930s extensively mapping large areas of previously unmapped desert. In 1931, Clayton was running triangulation from Wadi Halfa to Uweinat when he came across refugees fleeing from the Italian occupation of Kufra, via Uweinat and helped save many from death in the arid desert. Clayton had collaborated extensively with Ralph Bagnold in the preparation and mapping associated with Bagnold&#x27;s pre-war exploration trips.

At the start of the war Clayton was a government surveyor in Tanganyika. Bagnold had him returned to Egypt because of his detailed knowledge of the Western Desert. He was commissioned into the Intelligence Corps and served in the British Army&#x27;s Long Range Desert Group (LRDG).

Clayton was leading &quot;T&quot; Patrol in a planned attack on Kufra when the patrol was engaged by the Italian Auto-Saharan Company on 31 January 1941, near Gebel Sherif. During the action Captain Clayton was wounded and his car damaged. He along with his colleagues was taken prisoner. He was moved to the Abruzzo region in Italy where he was visited by Laszlo Almasy after Almasy&#x27;s spy mission, Operation &quot;Salaam&quot;, to transport two German spies across the Libyan desert to Cairo.

He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society&#x27;s Founder&#x27;s Medal in 1941 for his work in the Libyan desert.

==Death==
Pat Clayton died on 17 March 1962 at the age of 65 of an aneurysm.

Patrick Clayton Drive, built on the former Joint Services School of Intelligence site in Ashford, Kent, is named after him.

<text>The &quot;Pensacola&quot; class was a class of United States Navy heavy cruiser, the first &quot;treaty cruisers&quot; designed under the limitations set by the Washington Naval Treaty, which limited cruisers to a maximum of displacement and a maximum main battery caliber of .

==Description==

In an effort to remain within treaty limits, while still mounting a very heavy main battery of ten guns, the hull was of welded construction, and the armor belt was thin (varying from in thickness). This was inadequate to protect her vitals from enemy 8-inch shells and was no thicker than the armor on gun cruisers. In fact, and were classified as light cruisers due to their minimal armor, until re-designated in July 1931 as heavy cruisers in accordance with the provisions of the London Naval Treaty to designate all cruisers with guns larger than 6.1-inch as heavy cruisers.

Their main armament consisted of ten 8-inch guns, in two twin turrets on the main deck, and two triple turrets two decks above, making it one of the two US Navy ship classes (besides the s) to have different-sized turrets for main armament. All the guns in each turret were mounted in a single slide, and were unable to elevate independently of one another. Also, unlike the very few other ships with different-sized main battery turrets (&quot;Nevada&quot;-class battleships and &quot;King George V&quot;-class battleships) the &quot;Pensacolas&quot; had the larger turrets superfiring over the smaller turrets, whereas the others had the larger turrets on &quot;bottom&quot;. Placing heavier turrets above lighter ones allows for finer lines for a given length, however causing topheaviness and reducing stability.

Unfortunately, because of the rather unusual main battery layout and their heavy tripod fore-masts, they were top-heavy and prone to excessive rolling. This combined with low freeboard forward made them inferior seaboats compared to later designs. Rework in the shipyards modified the hull and superstructure in the 1930s to eliminate the rolling.

The Navy built only two ships in this class before switching to the design. Many of the deficiencies of the &quot;Pensacola&quot;s were corrected by reducing the main battery to three triple turrets (two forward, one aft) and adding another upper deck forward of amidships.

<text>The Fulda District (; ) is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the north-east of Hesse, Germany. Neighboring districts are Hersfeld-Rotenburg, Wartburgkreis, Schmalkalden-Meiningen, Rhön-Grabfeld, Bad Kissingen, Main-Kinzig, Vogelsbergkreis.

==History==
The district was created in 1821, when the duchy of Fulda became a province of Hesse, and was split into four districts. In 1866 the north of Hesse became a part of Prussia, including the Gersfeld area which previously belonged to Bavaria. In 1927 the city of Fulda left the district to become a district-free city, and in 1932 the remaining district was merged with the district of Gersfeld. In 1972, the previously small municipalities were merged into 23 bigger ones, and in 1974 the city of Fulda lost its status as district-free city and joined the district again. In 1972 the major part of the Hünfeld district was added to the district.

==Geography==

The district is located in the Rhön and Vogelsberg mountains. The main river of the district is the Fulda.

==Coat of arms==
The left side of the coat of arms shows a black cross, the sign of the monastery of Fulda. The lion on the right side is taken from the Hesse coat of arms, symbolizing that the district was part of Hesse 1821–1866, and again after 1945. The coat of arms was granted in 1936.

<doc id="203595" wikidata="Q191369" url="?curid=203595" title="Ugarit">
<text>Ugarit (; , &quot;ủgrt&quot; /ʾUgarītu/) was an ancient port city in northern Syria about 10 kilometers north of modern Latakia. At its height it ruled an area roughly equivalent to the modern Latakia Governorate. It was discovered by accident in 1928 with the Ugaritic texts. Its ruins are often called Ras Shamra after the headland where they lie.

==History==
Ugarit saw its beginnings in the Neolithic period, the site was occupied from the end of the 8th millennium BC and continued as a settlement through the Chalcolithic and Bronze Ages. It was during the late bronze age that Ugarit experienced significant growth, culminating in the establishment of the Kingdom of Ugarit.

The city had close connections to the Hittite Empire, in later times as a vassal, sent tribute to Egypt at times, and maintained trade and diplomatic connections with Cyprus (then called Alashiya), documented in the archives recovered from the site and corroborated by Mycenaean and Cypriot pottery found there. The polity was at its height from until its destruction in c. 1185 BC; this destruction was possibly caused by the purported Sea Peoples, or an internal struggle. The kingdom would be one of the many that fell during the Bronze Age Collapse. Gibala (Tell Tweini), the coastal city at the southern edge of the Ugarit kingdom was also destroyed at this time.

Based on archaeological soundings, the site was occupied beginning in the eighth millennium BC. Essentially all archaeology has focused on the Late Bronze levels, so little is known about earlier occupation.

===Middle Bronze Age===
====Middle Bronze II====
Ugarit was associated with the Great Kingdom of Yamhad (Halab, Aleppo) in Northern Syria. Ugarit is also mentioned in the Mari Archive.

In the Middle Bronze, evidence indicate that Ugarit had contacts with the Egyptian Middle Kingdom. A carnelian bead can be inscribed with the name of Senusret I. A stela and a statuette from the Egyptian pharaohs Senusret III and Amenemhet III have also been found. However, it is unclear at what time these monuments were brought to Ugarit.

===Late Bronze Age===

The city reached its golden age between 1500 BC and 1200 BC, when it ruled a trade-based coastal kingdom, trading with Egypt, Cyprus, the Aegean (primarily Crete), Syria, the Hittites, cities of the Levant (including Ashkelon), and much of the eastern Mediterranean. Five of the Amarna letters found in Akhenaten&#x27;s capital of Egypt from the mid-14th century BCE were written in Ugarit. Most of the letters were broken and their reading proved difficult, but some information was recovered. The population of Ugarit in this period is estimated to be between 7,000 and 8,000 individuals. The kingdom of Ugarit controlled about 2,000 km2 on average.

In the mid-14th century BC, Ugarit was ruled by king Ammittamru I. A letter (EA45) sent by him, probably to Amenhotep III (1388–1351 BC) expresses warm diplomatic relations between the two. During the reign of his son Niqmaddu II (c. 1350–1315 BC) Ugarit became a vassal of the Hittite Empire, mainly through the Hittite ruler&#x27;s viceroy in Karkemiš and then, with the Hititte collapse, directly under Karkemiš. Diplomatic relations with Egypt continued, as evidenced by two letters sent by Niqmaddu II (EA49) and his wife Ḫeba (EA48), probably sent to Akhenaten (1351–1334 BC). The former includes a request from the Egyptian king to send a physician to Ugarit.

===Destruction===
From the late 13th century into the early 12th century BC, the entire region, based on contemporary texts, including Hititte areas, the Levant, and the eastern Mediterranean, faced severe and widespread food shortages, potentially from plant diseases. Ugarit received a number of desperate pleas for food from other realms. The food shortage eventually reached Ugarit, previously a major supplier and transporter of food supplies. A letter from Egyptian pharaoh Merenptah referred to a missive sent by the ruler of Ugarit:
The last king of Ugarit, Ammurapi (circa 1215 to 1180 BC), was a contemporary of the last known Hittite king, Suppiluliuma II. The exact dates of his reign are unknown. However, a letter by the king is preserved, in which Ammurapi stresses the seriousness of the crisis faced by many Near Eastern states due to attacks. At this time Ugarit possessed a large army and navy and both joined with Hittite forces to try and stem the oncoming enemy, eventually having to fall back from Anatolia to the Syrian border. Ammurapi&#x27;s response to an appeal for assistance from the king of Alashiya highlights the desperate situation that Ugarit and other cities faced:

Eshuwara, the senior governor of Cyprus, responded:

At the end Ammurapi begs for forces from the Hittite viceroy at Carchemish, the enemy having captured Ugarit&#x27;s other port, Ra’šu, and was advancing on the city.
The ruler of Carchemish sent troops to assist Ugarit, but Ugarit had been sacked. A letter sent after Ugarit had been destroyed said:


By excavating the highest levels of the city&#x27;s ruins, archaeologists have studied various attributes of Ugaritic civilization just before their destruction and compared artifacts with those of nearby cultures to help establish dates. Ugarit contained many caches of cuneiform tablets inside of libraries that contained a wealth of valuable information. The destruction levels of the ruin contained Late Helladic IIIB pottery ware, but no LH IIIC (see Mycenaean period). Therefore, the date of the destruction of Ugarit is crucial for the dating of the LH IIIC phase in mainland Greece. Since an Egyptian sword bearing the name of pharaoh Merneptah was found in the destruction levels, 1190 BC was taken as the date for the beginning of the LH IIIC. A cuneiform tablet found in 1986 shows that Ugarit was destroyed sometime after the death of Merneptah (1203 BC). It is generally agreed that Ugarit had already been destroyed by the eighth year of Ramesses III (1178 BC). Recent radiocarbon work, combined with other historical dates and the eclipse of January 21, 1192, indicates a destruction date between 1192 and 1190 BC. Bay, an official of the Egyptian queen Twosret, in a tablet (RS 86.2230) found at Ras Shamra, was in communication with Ammurapi, the last ruler of Ugarit. Bay was in office from approximately 1194–1190 BC. This sets an upper limit on the destruction date of Ugarit. It is important to remember that the chronology of the ancient Near East and that of the ancient Egypt are not yet perfectly synchronized.

A large number of arrowheads were recovered from the destruction level in 2021. Their typology has not been published as yet.

==Rulers==
Early in the excavations a partial text of the Ugarit King List, in Ugaritic, was found. Later, complete renditions in Akkadian were discovered. They list twenty six rulers, all deified. Only the later rulers are supported by texts or known synchronisms. Given that Ugarit was abandoned between the Middle and Late Bronze Ages it is thought that the earliest names on the list were more on the order of tribal chiefs than kings.
==Archaeology==

After its destruction in the early 12th century BC, Ugarit&#x27;s location was forgotten until 1928 when a peasant accidentally opened an old tomb while plowing a field. At that time the region was part of the Alawite State, not in Syria. The discovered area was the necropolis of Ugarit located in the nearby seaport of Minet el-Beida. Excavations have since revealed a city with a prehistory reaching back to c. 6000 BC.

The site covers an area of about 28 hectares with a maximum height of 20 meters at the top of the acropolis. The site is surrounded by a city wall with one known fortified gate, though four gates are believed to have existed. Since the Late Bronze Age about 50 meters have been eroded from the north end of the site by the Nahr Chbayyeb river. The southern slope of the tell is covered by orange groves, preventing excavation. A brief investigation of a looted tomb at the necropolis of Minet el-Beida was conducted by Léon Albanèse in 1928, who then examined the main mound of Ras Shamra. Beginning in 1929 excavations of Ugarit were conducted by a French team called the Mission de Ras Shamra led by archaeologist Claude Schaeffer from the Musée archéologique in Strasbourg. Work continued until 1939 when it was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II.

The French excavation, now the Mission Archeologique Française de Ras Shamra-Ougarit, resumed in 1950, led again by Claude Schaeffer until 1970. At that point, directorship passed to Jean Margueron. After 44 excavation seasons all of the numerous finds and their findspots were collated. In 2005 the excavation became a joint French and Syrian effort led by Valérie Matoïan and Khozama Al-Bahloul. These continued until being ended due to the Syrian Civil War.

Archaeologists have defined a number of occupation strata at the site based on the excavations:
*Strata 1 - 500-300 BC - Helenistic up thru Arabi
*Lacuna - 900-600 BC - no occupation
*Stratum 2 - 1100-900 BC - Iron Age
*Stratum 3 - 1365-1200 BC - Late Bronze 2 = RS 1/3 = UR 3
*Stratum 4 - 1450-1365 BC - Late Bronze 1-2 = RS 1/2 = UR 2
*Stratum 5 - 1550-1450 BC - Late Bronze 1 = RS 1/1 = UR 1
*Lacuna - 1650-1550 BC - no occupation
*Stratum 6 - 1750-1650 BC - Middle Bronze &#x27;3&#x27; = RS 2/3 = UM 2
*Stratum 7 - 1900-1750 BC - Middle Bronze &#x27;2&#x27; = RS 2/2 = UM 2 = Middle Minoan 2
*Stratum 8 - 2100-1900 BC - Middle Bronze = RS 2/1 = UM 1
*Stratum 9 - 2300-2100 BC - Early Bronze 4 = RS 3/3 or III A; = UA 3
*Stratum 10 - 2500-2300 BC - Early Bronze 3 = RS 3/2 or III A 2 + 3; = UA 2
*Stratum 11 - c. 2800 BC - Early Bronze 1 - 2 = RS 3/1 or III B-C; = UA 1
*Stratum 12 - c. 3300 BC - &#x27;Ubayd chalcolithic = RS 4 A-B (with some RS 3)
*Stratum 13 - 4000 - 3400 BC - Halaf chalcolithic = RS 4-C (4 A-B)
*Stratum 14 - c. 4000 BC - Neolithic with pottery = RS 5 A-B
*Stratum 15 - c. 4500 BC - Pre-Pottery Neolithic = RS 5-C

A number of areas lay within the fortifications of Ugarit. In the northwest section was an acropolis with the temples of Dagon and Baal. In the west was the Royal Zone, including the Royal Palace. A fortress protecting the latter area was excavated, with the earliest elements dating back to the Middle Bronze Age. To the west of that lies the modern village of Ras Shamra. There were densely populated residential areas to the east of the Royal Zone and on the southern slope of the tell.

===Cuneiform tablets===
Numerous cuneiform tablets have been found. By the Late Bronze age Ugarit had a thriving dual-scribal system. Primarily it used the East Semitic Akkadian language which acted as the lingua franca throughout the region for diplomacy, business, and administrative purposes. In parallel, there was scribal activity in the local Northwest Semitic Ugaritic language. A few scribes are known to have worked in both writing systems. A number of archives were found, the largest being that of the household of Urtēnu, a merchant with trading ties as far afield as Emar. This area of the tell was under military control at the time and about 100 tablets were found in the rubble from military construction. Later excavation found several hundred tablets in the actual home. One tablet mentions the enthronement of Kassite ruler Kadashman-Harbe II (c. 1223 BC) whose rule lasted less than a year, allowing a tight synchronism. The latest datable text was from the reign of Kassite ruler Meli-Shipak II (c. 1186–1172 BC) about the time of the destruction of Ugarit. An example of the archive involving one ton of copper:
One small tablet written in Cypro-Minoan was found on the surface of the tell. While it traditionally has been assumed that syllabic texts are in the Akkadian language and alphabetic texts are in Ugaritic it has been suggested that much of the syllabic writing, especially in administrative documents, is actually in &quot;a jargon where an Akkadian dialect is hard to detect given the great amount of Ugaritic elements it contained&quot;.

===Royal palace===

The Royal Palace was constructed over several major phases between the 15th and 13th centuries BC. It comprised rooms arranged around courtyards, encompassing 6,500 square meters before the city&#x27;s destruction in the early 12th century BC. A tablet from the 14th century BC found in the Amarna archives, EA 89, Rib-Hadda of Byblos likening the palace at Tyre to the grandeur found in the palace within Ugarit&#x27;s walls. The palace was well constructed, predominantly crafted from stone, with preserved ashlar blocks reaching heights of up to 4 meters. Wooden crossbeams were also incorporated, inserted into slots within the stone masonry. A thick layer of plain plaster covered the walls. To the west of the palace was a set aside 10,000 square meter Royal Zone.
Archaeological findings within the ruins have included a variety of artifacts including ivory carvings, stone stele, figurines, and numerous tablets. These tablets were discovered in archives located across the palace; their contents encompass reports on outlying regions, judicial records—particularly from the south-central archives of the palace—and examples of practice writing by young scribes. Below ground, beneath two northern rooms, lay family tombs—three large chambers constructed with corbelled vaults—found devoid of any contents. The vanished upper floor likely accommodated the private quarters of the royal family, accessed via twelve staircases.

===Acropolis===

The Acropolis, positioned in the Ugarit&#x27;s northeastern section, housed the city&#x27;s primary temples dedicated to Baal and his father, Dagan. Though the existing remnants date to the Late Bronze Age, these temples might have their origins in the Middle Bronze Age. Stelai discovered in this area portray or name these gods, affirming their identification for the respective cults. Within the Temple of Baal, discoveries include the Baal with Thunderbolt depicting Baal holding a club aloft, portrayed in a typical Near Eastern and Egyptian artistic style as well as a stela bearing a dedication to Baal of Sapan. Numerous statues, stelai—some offered by Egyptians—and sixteen stone anchors were found as votive offerings in this vicinity.
Both temples are composed of a pronaos (porch) and a naos (sanctuary proper), aligned from north-northeast to south-southwest. The Temple of Dagan has 4–5-meter-thick foundation walls. Remnants of the Temple of Baal encompass sections of an enclosing wall, a likely courtyard altar, monumental steps leading to the elevated pronaos and naos, and another presumed altar within the naos. The temple was destroyed, possibly by an earthquake, in the mid 13th century and not rebuilt. The Temple of Dagan was also destroyed at that time but was rebuilt.

Another significant structure within the Acropolis was the House of the High Priest, situated west of the Temple of Dagan. This large, two-story residence, largely well-constructed, contained tablets containing mythological poems. Some tablets demonstrated writing exercises and included syllabic and bilingual lexicons, implying the building&#x27;s use as a center for scribe training. Its proximity to the primary temples and the discovery of bronze tools, particularly four small adzes and a dedicated hoe, hints at its potential role as the residence of the city&#x27;s chief priest. Among a cache of seventy-four bronze items uncovered beneath a doorway threshold inside the house, was an elegant tripod adorned with pomegranate-shaped pendants.

===Ras Ibn Hani and Minet el Beida===

Two nearby areas, Ras Ibn Hani and Minet el Beida, parts of the city of Ugarit, have also been excavated. Ras Ibn Hani, on a promontory overlooking the Mediterranean 5 kilometers south of the city, was discovered during commercial construction in 1977. Salvage excavation occurred in 1977 followed by regular excavation which has continued to the present by a Syrian-French team led by A. Bounni and J. Lagarce. Occupation began in the mid-13th century BC. Abandoned along with Ugarit, it was re-occupied in the Hellenistic period, including the construction of a defensive fortress. A &quot;royal palace&quot;, elite housing, and tombs were found. About 169 cuneiform tablets, most in the Ugaritic language, were also found.
One of the two ports of ancient Ugarit (the other, Ra’šu, is unlocated but suggested to be Ras Ibn Hani) was located 1.5 kilometers west of the main city, at the natural harbor of Minet el Beida (Arabic for &quot;White Harbor&quot;). The 28 hectare site was excavated between 1929 and 1935 by Claude Schaeffer. The site is currently a military port and unavailable for excavation. Its name in the Late Bronze Age is believed to have been Maʾḫadu. Archaeological excavations carried out on the southern side of the bay, now reduced in size due to alluvial fill, unveiled remnants of a settlement established in the 14th century BC, and perhaps earlier, in the late 15th century. This port town, featuring an urban layout akin to the city of Ugarit, displays irregular street formations. Dwellings were structured around courtyards with adjacent rooms, including provisions like wells, ovens, and occasionally subterranean tombs. Besides residential spaces and shrines, warehouses were present for storing diverse goods earmarked for import or export. One of them was discovered still housing eighty shipping jars that remain remarkably intact.

Artifacts discovered in the port indicate the predominance of native Ugaritians within the local populace, accompanied by a significant presence of various foreign communities such as Egyptians, Cypriots, Hittites, Hurrians, and Aegean peoples. Among the discoveries were Cypriot pottery (both imported and locally crafted), Mycenaean pottery, ivory cosmetic containers from Egypt, a terracotta depiction of Hathor, bronze tools and weaponry, cylinder seals, stone weights, remnants of banded dye-murex shells used in the production of purple dye, and inscribed tablets.

The site is thought to have been largely evacuated before it was burned (resulting in a thick ash layer) and destroyed as few valuables were found in the residences or in the southern palace. About 130 cuneiform tablets were found in the northern palace. After the destruction the site was occupied by simple residences, termed a village by the excavators. Aegean style pottery and loom weights were found in this Iron Age I level.

==Language and literature==
===Alphabet===
Scribes in Ugarit appear to have originated the &quot;Ugaritic alphabet&quot; around 1400 BC: 30 letters, corresponding to sounds, were inscribed on clay tablets. Although they are cuneiform in appearance, the letters bear no relation to Mesopotamian cuneiform signs; instead, they appear to be somehow related to the Egyptian-derived Phoenician alphabet. While the letters show little or no formal similarity to the Phoenician, the standard letter order (seen in the Phoenician alphabet as ʔ, B, G, D, H, W, Z, Ḥ, Ṭ, Y, K, L, M, N, S, ʕ, P, Ṣ, Q, R, Š, T) shows strong similarities between the two, suggesting that the Phoenician and Ugaritic systems were not wholly independent inventions. A Unicode block for Ugaritic has been defined.

===Ugaritic language===
The existence of the Ugaritic language is attested to in texts from the 14th through the 12th century BC. Ugaritic is usually classified as a Northwest Semitic language and therefore related to Hebrew, Aramaic, and Phoenician, among others. Its grammatical features are highly similar to those found in Classical Arabic and Akkadian. It possesses two genders (masculine and feminine), three cases for nouns and adjectives (nominative, accusative, and genitive); three numbers: (singular, dual, and plural); and verb aspects similar to those found in other Northwest Semitic languages. The word order in Ugaritic is verb–subject–object, subject-object-verb (VSO)&amp;(SOV); possessed–possessor (NG) (first element dependent on the function and second always in genitive case); and noun–adjective (NA) (both in the same case (i.e. congruent)).

===Ugaritic literature===

Apart from royal correspondence with neighboring Bronze Age monarchs, Ugaritic literature from tablets found in the city&#x27;s libraries include mythological texts written in a poetic narrative, letters, legal documents such as land transfers, a few international treaties, and a number of administrative lists. Fragments of several poetic works have been identified: the &quot;Legend of Keret&quot;, the &quot;Legend of Danel&quot;, the Ba&#x27;al tales that detail Baal-Hadad&#x27;s conflicts with Yam and Mot, among other fragments.
