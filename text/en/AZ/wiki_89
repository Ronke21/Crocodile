<text>Theodore Livingston (born March 5, 1963), better known as Grand Wizzard Theodore, is an American musician and DJ. He is widely credited as the inventor of the scratching technique. In addition to scratching, he gained credibility for his mastery of needle drops and other techniques which he invented or perfected.

==Early life==
Born in the Bronx, New York, Theodore&#x27;s brother, Mean Gene, was his mentor, who began teaching him the technique of DJing at an early age.

In 1975, Theodore was playing records in his bedroom with the volume all the way up. Furious with the noise, his mother entered the room and told Theodore to lower the volume, or she would turn off the music. According to Theodore, while his mother was standing in the doorway scolding him, he was still holding the record down with his hand, &quot;rubbing the record back and forth&quot;, causing a scratching sound. After his mother left, Theodore realized he liked the sound, and thought it would be a good idea to incorporate it into his DJing. After practicing for a while, he threw a party where he introduced the technique known as scratching.

A dramatization of Theodore&#x27;s invention of the record scratch was featured on Comedy Central&#x27;s television show &quot;Drunk History&quot;, narrated by Questlove.

==Career==
In the early 1980s, Theodore was a part of the group Grandwizard Theodore &amp; the Fantastic Five. They released &quot;Can I Get a Soul Clap&quot; in 1982. He was also featured in the 1983 film &quot;Wild Style&quot;, as well as contributing to the film&#x27;s soundtrack. He explains the origin of the scratch in the documentary, &quot;Scratch&quot;.

==Legacy==
Theodore&#x27;s phrase &quot;Say turn it up&quot; from his track &quot;Fantastic Freaks at the Dixie&quot; was sampled by hip hop and rap acts such as Public Enemy (on the track &quot;Bring the Noise&quot;), Bomb the Bass (on the track &quot;Megablast&quot;), and many others.

<doc id="210498" wikidata="Q1363321" url="?curid=210498" title="Professional Golfers' Association of America">
<text>The Professional Golfers&#x27; Association of America (PGA of America) is an American organization of golf professionals that was founded in 1916. Consisting of nearly 29,000 members, the PGA of America&#x27;s undertaking is to establish and elevate the standards of the profession and to grow interest and participation in the game of golf.

In 1968, the PGA Tour was spun off from the PGA of America as a separate organization to administer professional golf tours. However, the PGA of America still directly conducts several tournaments, including the PGA Championship, the Senior PGA Championship, and the Women&#x27;s PGA Championship.

On December 4, 2018, the PGA of America announced plans to relocate its headquarters from Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, to a planned 660-acre mixed-use development in Frisco, Texas. PGA Frisco is a public and private partnership between the PGA of America, Omni Hotels &amp; Resorts, the City of Frisco and the Frisco Independent School District. The 660-acre campus inaugurated in May 2023 and it includes the headquarters of PGA America, Northern Texas PGA, Fields Ranch (two world-class 18-hole championship golf courses and a state-of-the-art clubhouse), Omni PGA Frisco Resort, The Monument Realty PGA District (retail and entertainment district).

==History==
The Professional Golfers&#x27; Association of America was established on April 10, 1916, but the genesis of the first all-professional golf body in the United States was sparked by a luncheon on January 17, 1916, hosted by Rodman Wanamaker at Wanamaker&#x27;s Store on Ninth Street and Broadway in New York City. Sixty attendees were invited by the Taplow Club, which was a business group within Wanamaker&#x27;s Store and led by professional Tom McNamara of Brookline, Massachusetts, an outstanding player and talented salesman who was keenly aware of the welfare of the club professional. McNamara pressed upon Wanamaker that it was prime time to bring U.S. professionals together, and that the publicity generated would be advantageous. Locked into a retail battle with rival A.G. Spalding &amp; Bros. for the sale of golf balls, Wanamaker enthusiastically approved the initiative. He asked McNamara to arrange the luncheon inviting prominent amateur and professional golf leaders from throughout the country.

Wanamaker&#x27;s ninth floor restaurant was chosen as the site for the Monday luncheon, which attracted amateur great Francis Ouimet; noted writer, player and budding architect A.W. Tillinghast; and P.C. Pulver, the New York Evening Sun reporter and one of the first newspaper golf &quot;beat&quot; writers who later served as the first editor of The Professional Golfer, today&#x27;s PGA Magazine. The guest list also included some of America&#x27;s top professionals: Alex Smith, James Maiden, Robert White, Jack Mackie and Alex Pirie, as well as others who derived their livelihoods from their jobs at private and public golf facilities.

The Taplow Club was not an eatery or dining establishment. Instead, it was Wanamaker&#x27;s nickname for his in-store business group. He had taken the name from a palatial estate he leased on Taplow Court some 25 miles outside London. He would later stamp &quot;Taplow&quot; on his store&#x27;s lower-end, private-label golf balls. Wanamaker, who was not a golfer, was never reported to have attended the luncheon. He delegated the details to McNamara. With golf becoming more and more popular in the U.S., McNamara believed that his fellow professionals could benefit by working together. Wanamaker also believed consolidating professionals would also improve their social standing, having long been treated by club members as second-class citizens.

Toastmaster Joseph H. Appel, vice president of Wanamaker&#x27;s foundation, presented Wanamaker&#x27;s offer to conduct a match play championship for professionals, similar to Great Britain&#x27;s News of the World Tournament. Appel also broached the subject of a national association of professionals.

In addition, Wanamaker would donate a cup and $2,580 in prize money, and would ultimately pay the travel expenses of the competitors. That &quot;cup&quot; became the Rodman Wanamaker Trophy, and the tournament the PGA Championship. The inaugural PGA Championship was held October 10–14, 1916, at Siwanoy Country Club in Bronxville, New York, and won by English-born Jim Barnes.

Former British PGA Secretary James Hepburn suggested that the 32 lowest finishers in the U.S. Open would be paired for match play, following Robert White&#x27;s contention that the U.S. was too large for section qualifiers. The all-professional match play concept was in direct contrast to the United States Golf Association&#x27;s medal (stroke) play format. Wanamaker requested that the proposal for the Championship be contingent upon approval by the USGA or other governing bodies.

Tillinghast spoke up and declared that the professionals should be independent of the USGA in handling their own affairs and competitions. Tillinghast&#x27;s argument held, as a follow-up organizational meeting was planned the following day in Wanamaker&#x27;s store.

Organizers then formed a seven-person group whose primary task was to define tentative bylaws for the new association. They named Hepburn to chair an organizational committee of professionals that included Maiden, White and Mackie, as well as Gilbert Nicholls, John &quot;Jack&quot; Hobens, and Herbert Strongnone of the group was American-born. This group drafted a constitution, turning to the British PGA for assistance.

The luncheon agenda addressed giving golf professionals say when it came to the organization and staging of tournaments, among other employment issues.

The response to creating such a body was positive, and additional meetings followed. On April 10, 1916, in the second-floor boardroom of the Hotel Martinique on 32nd and Broadway, the Professional Golfers&#x27; Association of America was born. There were 78 members elected that day, including 35 PGA Charter Members, of which 28 were born outside the U.S.

The Association began with seven PGA Sections: Metropolitan, Middle States, New England, Southeastern, Central, Northwestern and Pacific. Today, there are 41 PGA Sections nationwide.

From 1934 through November 1961, the PGA of America maintained a &quot;Caucasian-only&quot; membership clause in its bylaws. The clause was removed by amending its constitution. The previous year, it had voted to retain the clause, and had gained the ire of California Attorney General Stanley Mosk, who threatened to shut down the PGA in the state until the clause was removed. The 1962 PGA Championship was scheduled for Brentwood Country Club in Los Angeles, but the PGA moved it to Philadelphia at Aronimink.

With an increase of revenue in the late 1960s due to expanded television coverage, a dispute arose between the touring professionals and the PGA of America on how to distribute the windfall. The tour players wanted larger purses, where the PGA desired the money to go to the general fund to help grow the game at the local level. Following the final major in July 1968 at the PGA Championship, several leading tour pros voiced their dissatisfaction with the venue and the abundance of club pros in the field. The increased friction resulted in a new entity in August, what would eventually become the PGA Tour. Tournament players formed their own organization, American Professional Golfers, Inc. (APG), independent of the PGA of America. After several months, a compromise was reached in December: the tour players agreed to abolish the APG and form the PGA &quot;Tournament Players Division&quot;, a fully autonomous division under the supervision of a new 10-member Tournament Policy Board. The board consisted of four tour players, three PGA of America executives, and three outside members, initially business executives. It hired its own commissioner and was renamed the &quot;PGA Tour&quot; in the mid-1970s.

Women were not allowed to be members of the PGA until 1977.

In October 2014, PGA President Ted Bishop responded to Ian Poulter&#x27;s criticism of the Ryder Cup captaincy of Nick Faldo and Tom Watson by calling Poulter a &quot;lil&#x27; girl&quot;, which led to Bishop&#x27;s firing. The PGA called Bishop&#x27;s statements &quot;unacceptable&quot; and &quot;insensitive gender-based&quot;.

==Championships==
The PGA conducts annual men&#x27;s, senior, and women&#x27;s major championships: the PGA Championship, the Senior PGA Championship, and the Women&#x27;s PGA Championship (which was renamed from the LPGA Championship in 2015 after a partnership between the LPGA and the PGA of America to heighten the event&#x27;s profile). All three tournaments feature professional golfers, but their fields also contain slots reserved for club professionals.

The PGA conducts more than 30 tournaments for its members and apprentices, including the PGA Professional Championship and the Assistant PGA Professional Championship. It also co-organizes the biennial Ryder Cup, PGA Cup and in 2019, the inaugural Women&#x27;s PGA Cup.

==Growth of the game==
In 2003, the PGA of America created the Player Development department within the Association in an endeavor to reach out to new, past and sporadic adult golfers. This is accomplished through the growth, promotion and support of instructional programs and events at PGA Member facilities that support adults and families to play golf. Included in these programs is Play Golf America, instigated in 2004 with the help of the Allied Associations (LPGA, National Golf Course Owners Association, PGA Tour, USGA, and others involved in the annual Golf 20/20 Conference).

<text>Salt-N-Pepa (sometimes stylized as Salt &#x27;N&#x27; Pepa) is an American hip hop group formed in New York City in 1985, that comprised Salt (Cheryl James), Pepa (Sandra Denton), and DJ Spinderella (Deidra Roper). Their debut album, &quot;Hot, Cool &amp; Vicious&quot; (1986), sold more than 1 million copies in the US, making them the first female rap act to achieve gold and platinum status by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album included the single, &quot;Push It&quot;, which was released in 1987 as the B-side to their single &quot;Tramp&quot;, and peaked within the top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Salt-N-Pepa&#x27;s second album &quot;A Salt with a Deadly Pepa&quot; (1988), was certified gold by the RIAA. The Trio&#x27;s third album, &quot;Blacks&#x27; Magic&quot; (1990), featured the singles &quot;Expression&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Sex&quot;. In 1993, they released the album, &quot;Very Necessary&quot;, which sold more than 7 million copies worldwide (5 million of those in the U.S.), and was the highest-selling rap album by a female act (solo or group) in history at the time. The album included the hit singles &quot;Shoop&quot; and &quot;Whatta Man&quot; with En Vogue. They won the 1995 Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for their song &quot;None of Your Business&quot;, making them one of the first female rap acts to win a Grammy Award, along with Queen Latifah, who won later during the same ceremony. In 2021, they won a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

Salt-N-Pepa have sold more than 15 million records worldwide, making them one of the best selling rap acts of all time. Their success in rap and hip hop culture has earned them the honorific title &quot;The First Ladies of Rap&quot;.

==History==
===1985–1987: Formation and &quot;Hot, Cool &amp; Vicious&quot;===
Denton worked as a telephone solicitor at a Sears in College Point. She met Cheryl James in the Sears lunchroom. They both were also enrolled as nursing students at Queensborough Community College. The pair became close friends, and also co–workers at Sears, along with future celebrities Kid N&#x27; Play and Martin Lawrence. Another co-worker Hurby &quot;Luv Bug&quot; Azor was studying music production at the Center of Media Arts and had his then-girlfriend Cheryl James, and also Sandra Denton, record a song for him as a class project he had to do. This resulted in the song &quot;The Showstopper&quot;, an answer record to Doug E. Fresh&#x27;s hit single &quot;The Show&quot; by the duo, who originally called themselves Super Nature. The song used a melody from the 1984 film &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot;. Azor passed the song along to his friend Marley Marl who hosted a weekend rap show on a New York City radio station. Marl occasionally included the song in his set rotation, and it became so popular that the station received requests to play it during Marl&#x27;s weekend rap set. The song, however, was not available in stores as it was simply a music school assignment. The independent Pop Art Records stepped in and offered to give the song an official release, and &quot;The Show Stoppa (Is Stupid Fresh)&quot; became a modest R&amp;B hit, reaching No. 46 on the US Billboard R&amp;B chart. 

After finding some success with &quot;The Show Stoppa (Is Stupid Fresh)&quot;, Azor, James, and Denton decided to focus on the group full-time, with Denton and James soon dropping out of nursing school. Azor changed the group&#x27;s name to Salt-N-Pepa, based on the song&#x27;s lyrics &quot;Right now I&#x27;m gonna show you how it&#x27;s supposed to be &#x27;Cause we, the salt and pepper MCs&quot;, which had resulted in radio stations getting phone calls requesting &quot;The Showstopper&quot; by Salt And Pepper. In September 1985, the group signed to Next Plateau Records, but the label only wanted to release a single at first; James and Denton recorded &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Your Man&quot;, produced by Azor, and the label released it. The song utilized a melody from the hit single &quot;Flash Light&quot; by funk band Parliament. Next Plateau had now requested a full-length album, and Azor felt the group should be a female trio, similar to the male rap trio Run DMC. Before starting work on a full-length album, Azor recruited DJ Latoya Hanson (called Spinderella) into Salt-N-Pepa. The ladies worked on the album and in December 1986 the trio&#x27;s debut album &quot;Hot, Cool &amp; Vicious&quot; was released, produced by Azor, Salt&#x27;s boyfriend at the time and the group&#x27;s manager. Hanson was in the group for a few months but she and Salt were not on friendly terms and Hanson departed the group after they finished the album, but just before it was distributed to stores. Soon after, in early 1987, 16-year-old high school student Deidra Roper was recruited into the group by Azor and became known as Spinderella, the DJ in the group.

&quot;Hot, Cool &amp; Vicious&quot; included some moderate rap/R&amp;B radio hits such as &quot;The Showstopper&quot;, &quot;My Mic Sound Nice&quot;, and &quot;Tramp&quot;, but when San Francisco DJ and producer Cameron Paul created a remix to &quot;Push It&quot;, the B-side of the &quot;Tramp&quot; single, it gave the group their first major hit. &quot;Push It&quot; (US #19, UK #2) became a platinum single in the United States, and a hit in several other countries, and was added to subsequent pressings of &quot;Hot, Cool &amp; Vicious&quot;. It was nominated for a Grammy Award, and the strength of that single catapulted the album to platinum sales in the U.S. with over 1 million copies sold, making Denton, James, and Roper the first female rap act to go platinum. The album ultimately sold 1.4 million copies worldwide.

The group entered the music industry at a time when hip hop was believed to be a fad, and as major record companies were very reluctant to sign hip hop artists, many early hip hop artists recorded for independent labels. Salt-N-Pepa greatly impacted hip hop by being one of the first all-female rap groups. Concerned about sexist lyrics and video clips that objectified women&#x27;s bodies in hip hop, many feminists disliked rap and hip hop because it negatively portrayed women. However, Salt-N-Pepa changed the look of hip hop. They were scantily clad in sexy clothing and were not afraid to talk about sex and their thoughts about men. Their song &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Sex&quot; was a huge hit.

===1988–1992: &quot;A Salt with a Deadly Pepa&quot; and &quot;Blacks&#x27; Magic&quot;===
Salt-N-Pepa&#x27;s next album, &quot;A Salt with a Deadly Pepa&quot;, was released on July 26, 1988, and contained the top 10 R&amp;B hit &quot;Shake Your Thang&quot;, featuring the go-go band E.U. Also, a top 20 R&amp;B hit and a minor pop hit were seen in &quot;Get Up Everybody (Get Up)&quot; and &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, respectively; with &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; becoming a major hit in the UK (#4), and several European countries. The album sold 800,000 copies globally, with 500,000 of those sold in the US, obtaining gold-status in the US.

The group&#x27;s third album &quot;Blacks&#x27; Magic&quot; was released on March 19, 1990 and saw personal moments for the trio on different levels. Pepa had become the first group member to become pregnant. Azor produced some songs on the album, but as he was producing other acts, he agreed to let the group work with different producers to finish the album. Salt and Spinderella took on some producing assignments themselves, and the trio hired different producers, such as Invincible&#x27;s producer Dana Mozie. This was the first album to feature Roper on vocals throughout much of the album as well as DJing. The result was six singles released by Next Plateau Records, several of which became hits: &quot;Expression&quot; (US #26, UK #40 in &quot;1990&quot;, UK #23 in &quot;1992&quot;), a platinum single, produced by Salt; &quot;Independent&quot;; &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot; (featuring Kid &#x27;n Play); &quot;Do You Want Me&quot; (US #21, UK #5), certified gold; &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Sex&quot; (US #13, UK #2), certified gold, and later re-recorded as &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About AIDS&quot; for an awareness promotion; and &quot;You Showed Me&quot; (US #47, UK #15). The album ultimately sold 1.6 million copies worldwide with 1 million of those sold in the U.S. A greatest hits album called &quot;A Blitz of Salt-N-Pepa Hits&quot;, featuring some remixed versions of songs from the group&#x27;s first three albums later was released.

In 1992, they appeared in the film &quot;Stay Tuned&quot;, performing the song &quot;Start Me Up&quot;.

===1993–1996: Groundbreaking success, &quot;Very Necessary&quot;===
Salt-N-Pepa&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Very Necessary&quot; was released on October 12, 1993, on London Records. The album featured songwriting and production by Salt, Pepa, Spinderella, and Azor. Buoyed by the hits &quot;Shoop&quot; (U.S. #4, UK #13), co-produced by Pepa; &quot;Whatta Man&quot; (U.S. #3, UK #7) (featuring En Vogue); and &quot;None of Your Business&quot;, a top 40 U.S. hit and a top 20 UK hit, &quot;Very Necessary&quot; eventually sold 7 million copies worldwide, with 5 million of those in the U.S. - 5× platinum status. This made them the first female rap act (solo or group) to have a multi-platinum certified album. In 1994, they co-headlined The Very Necessary 12 Play Tour with R. Kelly. The trio won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group in 1995 for the single &quot;None of Your Business&quot;, making them the first female rap act to win a Grammy, along with Queen Latifah who later won at the same ceremony. &quot;Very Necessary&quot; is the best-selling album by a female rap act. During this period, they also appeared in films. Salt co-starred in the movie &quot;Who&#x27;s the Man?&quot; (1993) and Pepa co-starred in the film &quot;Joe&#x27;s Apartment&quot; (1996). Pepa became romantically involved with Treach of the rap group Naughty By Nature.

===1997–2004: &quot;Brand New&quot; and hiatus===
By the time of their next album release, Salt-N-Pepa had gone through the legal process of completely breaking away from Azor, whom they accused of unfair royalty payments. Salt had already stopped being romantically involved with him due to their many ups-and-downs. The trio left London Records after one album and signed with Red Ant Records, though still distributed by PolyGram Records (the label that had distributed their &quot;Very Necessary&quot; album on London Records) through PolyGram&#x27;s Island Records label. Red Ant paid the trio a $15 million signing bonus when they signed their contracts. The group undertook production duties once again, but this time Azor was not involved in any part of the album. This would be the first and only album without any production from Azor. The result was the album &quot;Brand New&quot;, released on October 21, 1997. However, Red Ant was having financial difficulties and filed for bankruptcy soon after the album hit stores, halting marketing and promotion on all its releases, including Salt-N-Pepa&#x27;s album. The group toured in support of the album, but without any promotion from the bankrupt label, they only scored minor hits with &quot;R U Ready&quot; and &quot;Gitty Up&quot;. The album was certified gold in the US for sales of 500,000 copies and sold approximately another 100,000 copies internationally. Although not as big a seller as its predecessor, it kept intact an unbroken string of gold or platinum studio albums by the trio.

In March 1999, Salt-N-Pepa embarked on a tour. Pepa married Treach of Naughty by Nature on July 27 of the same year. Salt-N-Pepa&#x27;s greatest-hits album, titled &quot;The Best of Salt-N-Pepa&quot;, was released in Europe on January 25, 2000. Pepa and Treach remained married for two years, but their tumultuous marriage ended in divorce on July 31, 2001. With no albums contractually due at the time, Salt decided to quit the group, stating she had enough of the music industry and no longer wanted to be involved in it. They officially disbanded in 2002. Some time later, Salt announced that she would release a solo album, but ultimately did not do so. She was featured on the remix version of the Salt City Six&#x27;s &quot;Shine&quot; on the album &quot;Holy South Worldwide&quot;, a compilation of Christian rap and Christian R&amp;P (Rhythm &amp; Praise) songs. The album was produced by ex-Three 6 Mafia member-turned-Christian rapper Mr. Del. Salt also revealed in later interviews that she had suffered from bulimia many years ago. Pepa appeared on the fifth season of VH-1&#x27;s &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;. Spinderella became a radio personality on KKBT 100.3 in Los Angeles. She hosted &quot;The Backspin&quot; (with DJ Mo&#x27;Dav), a nationally syndicated weekly radio show featuring old school hip hop music. She also periodically DJs at various clubs. The trio was disbanded for a total of five years.

===2005–present: Reunion, other ventures and DJ Spinderella’s departure===

Salt and Pepa both appeared on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Hip Hop Honors&quot; in September 2005. All three women reunited the following year for the next &quot;Hip Hop Honors&quot; program and performed &quot;Whatta Man&quot; with En Vogue. It was the trio&#x27;s first performance in six years, and was their first performance of &quot;Whatta Man&quot; with En Vogue on stage. Salt-N-Pepa reformed in 2007. All three women now have children. Spinderella has a daughter, with former NBA player Kenny Anderson, who has appeared on MTV&#x27;s &quot;My Super Sweet Sixteen&quot; in 2008. Pepa has a son and a daughter, her daughter being fathered by rapper Treach. Salt has a daughter and a son.

On October 14, 2007, &quot;The Salt-N-Pepa Show&quot; debuted on VH1. Pepa had previously appeared on a different show on the network called &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;. &quot;The Salt-N-Pepa Show&quot; chronicled events in the lives of Pepa and Salt as they work out past issues. Spinderella has been featured in several episodes. Later in 2008, the trio performed at the BET Hip Hop Awards. That August, Pepa released an autobiography titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Pep&quot;, co-written by Karen Hunter, which features an introduction by Queen Latifah and an epilogue by Missy Elliott. To accompany the book, she launched her own social network for fans and also starred in the reality TV series &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Pep&quot; on VH1.

On May 9, 2009, Salt-N-Pepa performed at the Ladies of the 80s concert in Honolulu, which also featured SWV and Lisa Lisa. They performed at the Good Vibrations Festival in Australia in February 2010, and the South West Four Festival, Clapham Common, London on August 29, 2010. On October 12, 2010, Salt-N-Pepa received the I Am Hip Hop Award at the BET Hip Hop Awards.

On February 4, 2011, Salt-N-Pepa headed on a national tour titled Salt-N-Pepa&#x27;s Legends of Hip Hop Tour. Other acts on the tour included Whodini, Rob Base, Kurtis Blow, Doug E Fresh, Biz Markie, Naughty By Nature, MC Lyte, Big Daddy Kane, Kool Moe Dee, Slick Rick, and Chubb Rock. On November 21, 2011, Salt-N-Pepa appeared on &quot;The X Factor&quot; Australia&#x27;s third season with contestant and finalist Johnny Ruffo. They performed &quot;Push It&quot;. On July 30, 2012, Salt-N-Pepa opened for rap group Public Enemy in Brooklyn, New York as part of the Martin Luther King Jr. Concert Series. 

The trio made a November 2014 appearance in a Geico insurance commercial performing &quot;Push It&quot;. Salt-N-Pepa appeared on the December 18, 2015 episode of The Wendy Williams Show performing &quot;Push It&quot;. The performance started out with Wendy Williams pretending to be the DJ, thus Spinderella ultimately assumed the duties. This was an allusion to the fact that Roper, Williams, and several other women had auditioned for the part of DJ in the group back in 1987; the DJ role ultimately being won by Roper. The group&#x27;s hit song &quot;Shoop&quot; made a comeback on February 12, 2016, as one of the theme songs featured in the blockbuster Marvel movie &quot;Deadpool&quot;. The trio performed in Red Deer, Alberta, Canada for Westerner Days at the Enmax Centrium on July 21, 2016.

In 2017–2018, the group toured as part of the I Love the 90&#x27;s tour, performing in various locations, including in the UK Wembley Arena, Glasgow SSE, Liverpool Echo Arena and Birmingham. On October 16, 2018, Salt-N-Pepa appeared on the U.S. version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;, with Kid N Play serving as their &quot;plus one&quot; in-studio lifeline.

On May 2, 2019, the Mixtape Tour commenced in Cincinnati, Ohio. Performers on this tour include Salt-N-Pepa, Debbie Gibson, Tiffany, and Naughty by Nature, with New Kids on the Block being billed as the headline performers. The next day, DJ Spinderella announced in an Instagram post that she had been &quot;terminated&quot; from Salt-N-Pepa as of January. She broke her silence after the band hadn&#x27;t publicly announced their parting ways with her, insinuating that Salt-N-Pepa remained silent about the split in order to manipulate fans into thinking she was part of their upcoming projects. DJ Cocoa Chanelle, formerly of BET Networks and HOT 97, became the replacement DJ.

In March 2019, it was announced that Salt-N-Pepa would have a biographical miniseries coming to the Lifetime network, highlighting the rise of the group to become one of the first successful female rap groups in hip hop. On January 23, 2021, Lifetime released an eponymous biopic, directed by Mario Van Peebles, which starred GG Townson as Salt, Laila Odom as Pepa, Monique Jasmine Paul as DJ Spinderella, Cleveland Berto as Hurby Azor, and featured Daniel Keith Morrison as MC Hammer, Denver Taylor as Martin Lawrence, Bronson Phillip Lake as Christopher &quot;Kid&quot; Reid, and Devante Senior as Christopher &quot;Play&quot; Martin. Salt and Pepa served as the executive producers while Queen Latifah served as a producer. A &quot;Special Edition&quot; of the film was released on January 23, 2021.

On November 4, 2022, all three members temporarily reunited to be honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located by the Amoeba Music store on Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>Exposé is an American freestyle vocal group originally formed in 1984 in Miami, Florida.The group has primarily consisted of lead vocalists Jeanette Jurado, Ann Curless, and Gioia Bruno. The group achieved much of its success between 1984 and 1993, becoming the first group to attain four top 10 entries on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, including the 1988 number one single &quot;Seasons Change.&quot; Exposé’s seven consecutive Top 10 hits on the US Hot 100 landed them behind only The Supremes (with nine consecutive Top 10 hits) for most Top 10 hits by an all-female group. In March 2015, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine named the group the eighth most successful girl group of all time.

The group was popular in dance clubs and the mainstream Top 40, as well as adult contemporary charts in the United States. They toured and recorded music from 1984 to 1995, then retired from recording and public performances until 2003.

==History==
===Formation and original members (1984–1986)===
Exposé was formed in 1984 by Miami disc jockey and producer Lewis Martineé. Working with his partners Ismael Garcia and Frank Diaz at Pantera Productions, talent scouts hired Sandra &quot;Sandeé&quot; Casañas, Alejandra &quot;Alé&quot; Lorenzo, and Laurie Miller as the group&#x27;s original lineup, under the name X-Posed, which later became Exposé. That year, the trio recorded &quot;Point of No Return&quot; for Pantera Records. In 1985, Exposé signed with Arista Records, which re-released the song as a 12-inch vinyl single. It became a #1 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart. The song helped popularize a genre of music that became known as freestyle. Later that year, Exposé recorded and released their second single titled, &quot;Exposed to Love.&quot; Following the success, Arista approved a full-length album from the group.

=== Lineup change and &quot;Exposure&quot; (1986–1988) ===
During the recording of their first studio album &quot;Exposure&quot;, the group&#x27;s lineup changed. Accounts differ as to how these lineup changes came to be. While Martineé stated that he decided to replace the three band members, Miller maintains that each member quit by choice. Casañas and Miller went on to pursue solo careers, while Lorenzo pursued other ambitions. The new lineup was Jeanette Jurado, Gioia Bruno, and Ann Curless.

In 1987, Exposé released &quot;Exposure&quot; on Arista Records, led by the pop/dance hit &quot;Come Go with Me,&quot; which reached #5 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. A re-recorded version of &quot;Point of No Return&quot; sung by Jurado was released, and peaked at #5 on the US Hot 100. While the initial distribution of &quot;Exposure&quot; to suppliers contained the original 1984 version of the song, subsequent pressings contained the new version. &quot;Let Me Be the One,&quot; a mid-tempo R&amp;B song, reached #7 on the US Hot 100. The group&#x27;s highest-charting hit came in 1988 with the #1 US hit ballad &quot;Seasons Change&quot;.

The band received a Soul Train Award nomination for Best New Artist; made television appearances on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;Solid Gold&quot;, &quot;Showtime at the Apollo&quot;, and &quot;The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers&quot;; and performed as an opening act on the national tour for Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam. Exposé additionally provided backing vocals on Kashif&#x27;s album Love Changes. 

During this time, the group dealt with legal issues. Group members filed a lawsuit and ultimately settled the case for a renegotiated contract.

===&quot;What You Don&#x27;t Know&quot; (1989–1990)===
The group&#x27;s second album, &quot;What You Don&#x27;t Know&quot; (1989), was certified gold in the US with sales of over 500,000 copies. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;What You Don&#x27;t Know,&quot; peaked at #8. The second single &quot;When I Looked at Him&quot; rose to #10 on the US Hot 100. The next single &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; (#9) gave Exposé seven consecutive Top 10 hits on the US Hot 100. &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; addressed youth in street gangs and rewarded the group with additional praise for its socially conscious lyrics. &quot;Your Baby Never Looked Good in Blue&quot; (#9 U.S. Adult Contemporary / #17 Pop) followed soon afterwards. &quot;Stop, Listen, Look &amp; Think&quot; was released promotionally and also included in the film &quot;The Forbidden Dance&quot; (1990). Exposé also completed its first tour as headliner and appeared on &quot;Soul Train&quot;, &quot;The Pat Sajak Show&quot;, &quot;The Byron Allen Show&quot;, and the 1989 broadcast of &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot;.

In 1990, while touring with Exposé, Bruno began having throat problems, which was later linked to a benign tumor on her vocal cords. Ultimately, Bruno could not sing for several years and was replaced by Kelly Moneymaker in 1992. 

===&quot;Exposé&quot; (1991–1996)===
After Moneymaker joined Exposé, the group released its self-titled third album &quot;Exposé&quot;, which integrated more mature material into the group&#x27;s established freestyle, house, R&amp;B, pop, and love-ballad repertoire. Clive Davis took over as executive producer and Martineé contributed to its production.

The third album was not as commercially successful as their previous two, but still achieved gold status. Several singles fared well on the adult-contemporary charts. The group landed on the U.S. Top 40 pop chart with &quot;I Wish the Phone Would Ring&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Get Over You Getting Over Me&quot;, which also reached #1 on the adult contemporary chart. The group appeared on &quot;Live with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, &quot;The Les Brown Show&quot;, and the Brazilian children&#x27;s show &quot;Xuxa&quot;.

In 1995, Exposé recorded the Diane Warren-penned song &quot;I&#x27;ll Say Good-Bye for the Two of Us,&quot; which appeared on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home&quot;; that same year, the song was included in their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;.

=== Label inactivity and solo projects (1996–2003) ===
Toward the end of 1995, Arista dropped the group, and the members disbanded in 1996 to pursue other projects. In the years that followed, two greatest hits compilations and a collection of remixes were released.

After the group broke up, Jurado performed in the stage play Mad Hattan and supplied vocals for contemporary jazz guitarist Nils Lofgren and Safe Sax. Moneymaker married soap opera actor Peter Reckell and released four solo albums. Moneymaker also wrote and produced the &quot;Love Songs&quot; LP for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and had original songs placed in over 25 film, TV, and game productions including &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;, &quot;Hawaii 5-0&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and others. Curless worked in songwriting, supplied vocals to several club-dance projects, and also taught music and music business. Eventually, both Jurado and Curless married, had children and temporarily retired from performing.

In 1997, Bruno fully recovered from her throat tumor and returned to singing. After a small stint with the band Wet, she worked on a solo career focused mostly on dance-oriented material. Her first album, &quot;Expose This&quot;, was released in 2004.

=== Reformation (2003–present) ===

After a long hiatus, in 2003 Curless, Jurado, and Moneymaker reunited briefly for a reunion concert at the Mid State Fair in Paso Robles, California.

In 2006, Jurado announced that the group had signed with a major booking agency. Around the same time, Bruno announced that she was back with Exposé for the first time in 15 years. Moneymaker remains an honorary member of the group. 

Later in 2006, Exposé kicked off a tour at the American Airlines Arena in Miami for the Freestyle Explosion concert, with the lineup of Curless, Jurado, and Bruno. At the Potawatomi Bingo Casino Northern Lights Theater in Milwaukee, Exposé performed with a full band led by Steve Fansler, their first full concert together with Bruno since 1990.

Exposé recorded a 2011 version of their hit &quot;Point of No Return&quot; working with dance producer Giuseppe D. and Chris Cox, which was released that year. The group released a single for Christmas called &quot;I Believe in Christmas (Like It Used to Be)&quot; in 2011, co-written by Adam Gorgoni, Jeanette Jurado, and Shelly Peiken. Proceeds of the single went to the Wounded Warrior Project. In 2012, the group independently released the single &quot;Shine on,&quot; co-written by Ann Curless, who also sings lead vocals on the track.

In 2015, Cherry Pop Records reissued the group&#x27;s debut album. Consisting of two discs, the expanded reissue came with an extensive booklet and remixes.

==Trademark lawsuit==
In 2007, Jurado, Bruno, Curless, Moneymaker, Paradise Artists, and Walking Distance Entertainment were named as defendants in a lawsuit by Crystal Entertainment &amp; Filmworks (I &amp; II). At issue was the trademark licensing agreement for the rights to use the name Exposé. The first case was dismissed without prejudice. The second went to trial. 

During the process, both Paradise Artists and Moneymaker were dismissed as defendants, and a countersuit was filed against the plaintiffs. In 2009, the court ruled in favor of the defendants on most counts, finding them only guilty of a contractual breach with the plaintiffs. The court also ruled that the defendants showed common-law proof of ownership and the &quot;[consumer] goodwill associated with Exposé was with the members.&quot; The court awarded Jurado, Bruno, and Curless exclusive rights to the name Exposé as a trademark.

Exposé mentioned this victory and performed for the first time with Moneymaker as a guest at the Los Angeles Pride Festival in June 2009, making it the first time all four core members, Jurado, Bruno, Curless, and Moneymaker, appeared on stage together.

==History==
The Cover Girls were formed by music producer and songwriter Andy &quot;Panda&quot; Tripoli and music promoter and dance club owner Sal Abbatiello. The group was originally composed of singers Louise &quot;Angel&quot; Sabater, Caroline Jackson, and Sunshine Wright. In late 1986, they released their first album, &quot;Show Me&quot;. Five singles were released from this album, including the Top 40, &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hits &quot;Show Me&quot; and &quot;Promise Me&quot;. Sunshine Wright left the group in late 1987 after the release of the album and its second single &quot;Spring Love&quot;, and was replaced by Margo Urban. In 1988, they recorded the song &quot;Better Late Than Never&quot; for the &quot;Coming to America&quot; film soundtrack.

In 1989, their second album, &quot;We Can&#x27;t Go Wrong&quot;, was released and included the song &quot;My Heart Skips a Beat&quot; as well as the title track. The Cover Girls performed &quot;My Heart Skips a Beat&quot; and &quot;We Can&#x27;t Go Wrong&quot; on the series finale of &quot;American Bandstand&quot; in October 1989. &quot;All That Glitters Isn&#x27;t Gold&quot; was the third and final single released from the &quot;We Can&#x27;t Go Wrong&quot; album. Shortly after its release, Louise &quot;Angel&quot; Sabater left the group and was replaced on lead vocals by Evelyn Escalera.

The first song recorded with Escalera on lead was &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Now&quot;, released for the compilation album &quot;Music Speaks Louder Than Words&quot;, which was a joint collaboration between American and Soviet songwriters. The song&#x27;s music is a cover of Russian artist Viktor Reznikov&#x27;s 1988 song &quot;Domovoy&quot;, with new English lyrics written by Todd Cerney and Harold Payne. The song was released as a single in 1990 with &quot;Funk Boutique&quot; originally as the B-Side. 

In 1992, they released their third studio album, &quot;Here It Is&quot;, which features for the first time two lead singers, Escalera and Michelle Valentine, who replaced Margo Urban, who left the group a year prior. This album produced a cover version of the Rose Royce 1978 song &quot;Wishing on a Star&quot;. The second and third singles were &quot;Thank You&quot; and &quot;If You Want My Love (Here It Is)&quot;. Following the release of &quot;Thank You&quot; Caroline Jackson left the group. And Escalera and Valentine continued as a duo. In 1993, Escalera recorded vocals on a promotional single titled &quot;Can You Feel It&quot; by Fish released on Cupid Records.

In 1994, the group contributed the new song &quot;You Better Change&quot; to the soundtrack of the film &quot;I Like It Like That&quot;.

In 1996, they released their fourth and final album, titled, &quot;Satisfy&quot;. Lead and background vocals on this album was handled by Valentine, Gayle Ellis and Nicki Richards. The first single from the album, &quot;I Am Woman&quot;, was released originally with Valentine on lead vocals. But shortly after the single was released Valentine left the group. Lead vocals were then taken over by Gayle Ellis. On &quot;I Need Your Lovin&#x27;&quot;, the vocals on the album mix were by Valentine and the single remix vocals were handled by Ellis and Evelyn Escalera, whom then returned to the group from a hiatus. Nicki Richards also recorded lead vocals on some of the &quot;Satisfy&quot; album tracks, notably &quot;Whenever You Need Me&quot; and &quot;Keep on Giving Me Love&quot;.

In 2001, The Cover Girls re-grouped with Evelyn Escalera, and two new members Sabrina Nieves and Lorraine Munoz. 

In 2006, The Cover Girls contributed vocals on the Cobra Starship song &quot;The Ballad of Big Poppa and Diamond Girl&quot; from the Cobra Starship album While the City Sleeps, We Rule the Streets.

In November 2008, Evelyn Escalera released her first solo single, a cover of the Mariah Carey Christmas classic &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot;, under her new pseudonym Evelyn DeMille.

In 2010, Evelyn Escalera contributed the track &quot;Grown Up Christmas List&quot; to the album &quot;A Traditional Freestyle Christmas Vol 1&quot;.

In 2011, The &quot;Original&quot; Cover Girls featuring Louise &quot;Angel&quot; Mercado, Caroline Jackson and Margo Urban reunited with a performance at the 2011 Long Beach Pride festival. On May 17th, 2022, The &quot;Original&quot; Cover Girls, (Angel, Sunshine &amp; Margo) performed on the last episode of The Wendy Williams Show, hosted by Leah Remini and Michelle Visage. 

In 2021, original member Caroline Jackson retired from the group, and was replaced by former member Michelle Valentine. Valentine departed the group again in 2024 and was replaced by Michelle Viana.

On November 7, 2015, the Cover Girls (Escalera, Munoz, and Nieves) were featured in a documentary on freestyle music titled &quot;Legends of Freestyle&quot;, which interviewed freestyle artists and delved into the history and movement of this genre. The documentary presented by Stanulis Productions premiered at the HBO Urban Action Film Festival at the AMC Theater on November 7, 2015, in New York City.

<doc id="210508" wikidata="Q1701447" url="?curid=210508" title="World Class Wreckin' Cru">
<text>World Class Wreckin&#x27; Cru was an American electro group, during the 1980s in the Los Angeles area, that contributed to rap&#x27;s development. Two of its members, Dr. Dre and DJ Yella, attained greater fame as members of N.W.A, which pioneered gangsta rap. A song by the Cru had also featured R&amp;B singer Michel&#x27;le.

==Early career==
World Class Wreckin&#x27; Cru debuted in the nightclub Eve After Dark, owned by Alonzo Williams, an early West Coast DJ very popular in the Los Angeles area. In the 1970s, Williams had begun producing dance songs under the name Disco Construction, named after funk group Brass Construction. At his songs&#x27; popularity, Williams arranged nightclub performances. Initially directing its music program was Detroit-born Andre &quot;Unknown DJ&quot; Manuel (who would later join Comptons Most Wanted), who was influenced by East Coast sounds, like Soulsonic Force, Orbit, and Scorpio.

As the 1980s opened, electronic funk arrived, sampling drum beats and borrowing from old-school rap. Disco Construction created a subgroup, the Wreckin&#x27; Cru, which was the Lonzos&#x27; roadies. Later, this honorific prefix &quot;World Class&quot; signified a recording group. Lonzo hired two local DJs—Antoine &quot;Yella&quot; Carraby and Andre &quot;Dr. Dre&quot; Young—who became the original &quot;Mix Masters&quot; for Los Angeles radio station KDAY. The Wreckin&#x27; Cru performed in various shows elsewhere in Los Angeles, including shows promoted by Lonzo as well as opening for New Edition.

==Success and break up==
Alonzo Williams created the label &quot;Kru-cut&quot; which began releasing The Wreckin&#x27; Cru music through the mid-1980s with very minimal resources through Macola Records&quot;, a local independent record manufacturing and distributing company. The Cru released the single &quot;Slice&quot;, followed by &quot;Surgery&quot;. By 1985 Kru-Cut had produced World Class’ debut album, World Class. The success of their early releases led to a major record deal with CBS/Epic Records. With Cli-N-Tel leaving after the first album to control his own direction in life, this left Shakespeare to step up to be the prominent MC as they signed with Epic Records. With this they released a string of singles and also their second album, Rapped In Romance. 

After being signed to CBS records Lonzo was asked if he had any other acts. After seeing Dre&#x27;s cousin Jinx&#x27; group perform in a rap contest, a teenage group called C.I.A. (Cru in Action) starring O&#x27;Shea &quot;Ice Cube&quot; Jackson, Dre&#x27;s cousin Tony &quot;Sir Jinx&quot; Wheaton and Darrell &quot;K-Dee&quot; Johnson, who with Dre would record a demo tape called &quot;She&#x27;s a Skag&quot;. The group was then signed to a single deal with CBS.

After being released from CBS, in April 1986, the Wreckin’ Cru featuring Michel&#x27;le, Dre&#x27;s girlfriend, released their hit slow jam &quot;Turn off the Lights&quot; peaked at #54 on the Billboard Black Singles Charts. This was the WCWC biggest hit. WCWC which was primarily known as a dance and romance act released many locally successful songs including &quot;Surgery,&quot; &quot;Juice,&quot; &quot;Cabbage Patch,&quot; and &quot;Lovers during their tenure.

World Class&#x27;s success was building an army of fans in the underground scene and each member a valued reputation. At this stage the look of Prince and Michael Jackson&#x27;s Thriller outfits were cool, glitzy purple leather suits, sequin suits not unlike the glam-rock look running parallel to this scene, Dre was growing tired of the image and considered Lonzo&#x27;s direction to be soft and yearned to control his own expression in music. 

At this time, Dre was working on side projects for local entrepreneur Eric &quot;Eazy-E&quot; Wright in the Kru-Cut studio, and Ice Cube was ghostwriting for the World Class single &quot;House Calls/Cabbage Patch&quot; in 1986. The last time Dre was arrested and jailed for missed court appearances on multiple traffic violations was in 1986, when he owed $166, enough for an arrest warrant, and Lonzo refused to bail him out a third time. Eazy-E posted it in return for Dre&#x27;s production for E&#x27;s new record label, Ruthless Records. Eazy, Dre and Cube’s combined collaboration of talent then formed N.W.A. As a solo artist, Lonzo released another LP, titled Phases in Life, in 1990. World Class member Shakespeare sought to become a pastor.

<doc id="210518" wikidata="Q814169" url="?curid=210518" title="Executive Orders">
<text>Executive Orders is a techno-thriller novel, written by Tom Clancy and released on July 1, 1996. It picks up immediately where the final events of &quot;Debt of Honor&quot; (1994) left off, and features now-U.S. President Jack Ryan as he tries to deal with foreign and domestic threats. The book is dedicated to former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, who helped launch Clancy&#x27;s worldwide success as a novelist. The book debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list.

==Plot==
After a terrorist attack kills nearly every U.S. executive, legislative, and judicial figure, previously-confirmed Vice President Jack Ryan has been sworn in as President of the United States. As Ryan is left to represent the United States by himself, he must deal with multiple crises: reconstituting his own Cabinet, the House, the Senate, and the entire Supreme Court; a challenge to the legitimacy of his succession by former Vice President Ed Kealty, leading to press hazing; and a war brewing in the Middle East.

When the Iraqi president (implied to be Saddam Hussein) is assassinated by an Iranian deep-cover agent, Iranian leader Ayatollah Mahmoud Haji Daryaei takes advantage of the power vacuum by launching an unopposed invasion of Iraq and later uniting it with his country, calling the new entity the &quot;United Islamic Republic&quot; (UIR). Daryaei then secretly unleashes a master plan of &quot;weakening&quot; the United States through a series of terrorist attacks: a biological attack in the country using a weaponized strain of Ebola virus, a kidnapping attempt of Ryan&#x27;s youngest daughter Katie, and an assassination attempt on the President himself by a Secret Service bodyguard who is an Iranian sleeper agent.

China and India secretly assist Daryaei, first by causing a diplomatic crisis between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan when a PLAAF aircraft &quot;accidentally&quot; shoots down a Taiwanese airliner. The incident pulls a U.S. Navy carrier group from the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea and allows the Indian Navy&#x27;s carrier up to move undetected to the Strait of Hormuz, cutting off access to the only sea-bound pathway to the UIR and Saudi Arabia. Daryaei thinks that with the U.S. government and military overwhelmed by a multitude of crises, he is now free to invade Saudi Arabia and claim superpower status for the UIR.

The attack on Ryan&#x27;s daughter as well as the assassination attempt on the President are swiftly averted by the FBI and Secret Service. However, the Ebola epidemic causes Ryan to declare martial law and enforce a travel ban to contain the virus. The epidemic later burns out due to the virus being so fragile that it cannot spread effectively. Meanwhile, CIA operatives John Clark and Domingo Chavez are tasked with investigating the origin of the virus in Africa, where they later discover Daryaei&#x27;s involvement, connecting the puzzle of seemingly unrelated global crises. Ryan then deploys what is left of the United States military (the virus immobilized almost the entire military apparatus except for one fighter wing, two armored cavalry regiments, and one National Guard armor brigade that had been training at isolated Fort Irwin) to assist Saudi and Kuwaiti military forces in repelling a UIR invasion of Saudi Arabia.

The tide soon turns against the UIR, with its forces obliterated by the combined firepower of the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait. President Ryan had sent Clark and Chavez into Tehran, the de facto capital of the UIR, to target Daryaei with assistance from Russian intelligence. The Ayatollah is later killed in his residence by precision-guided munitions dropped from F-117 Nighthawks. Ryan then threatens to launch a tactical nuclear strike on Tehran unless those responsible for the attacks are immediately extradited to the U.S. to face charges, and the facility where the weaponized Ebola was cultured is neutralized. He announces a new foreign policy doctrine, the &quot;Ryan Doctrine&quot;, under which the United States will hold personally accountable any foreign leader who orders attacks on U.S. citizens, territory, or possessions in the future.

Kealty&#x27;s challenge to Ryan&#x27;s legitimacy fails in court; due to the way Kealty&#x27;s legal complaint was worded, the federal judge who hears the case inadvertently confirms that Ryan &quot;is&quot; the President. In the aftermath of the crisis, public appreciation of the unelected president grows.

==Themes==
The novel is composed of three major storylines. The first part is a realistic portrait about being the President of the United States, with &quot;a near fetishistic pleasure out of detailing the ways in which [the chief executive] is robbed of his private life every minute of the day&quot;, according to novelist Marc Cerasini&#x27;s essay on the book. The second part is about domestic critics and enemies — &quot;venal politicos, fat cats, and corrupt media types&quot;, according to Publishers Weekly&#x27;s review of the novel — that cause problems for President Ryan as he tries to rebuild the entire U.S. government with his centre-right politics and his grassroots American values. The third part features the United Islamic Republic&#x27;s quest to become a superpower, which turns the novel into a &quot;taut and harrowing&quot; medical thriller that culminates in a military confrontation on land, sea, and air that is regarded as callback to Clancy&#x27;s war novel &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; (1986).

Clancy also discusses whether political outsiders, in this case Jack Ryan himself, are better reformers than those who have worked within the system, a theme explored in movies like &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939) and &quot;Dave&quot; (1993).

==Reception==
Promoted by publishing company Putnam in an $800,000 marketing campaign that pitched Jack Ryan as running for president, &quot;Executive Orders&quot; sold 56,000 copies in its first week at Barnes &amp; Noble. It eventually sold 2.3 million copies.

The book received generally positive reviews. Publishers Weekly praised Clancy as &quot;a war-gamer without peer, and his plotting here is masterful, as is his strumming of patriotic heartstrings&quot;; they concluded: &quot;This is heavyweight entertainment, and come pub date it&#x27;s going to be the world champion of the bestseller lists.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; hailed the novel as &quot;compelling entertainment&quot;, explaining: &quot;[it] shows that, despite the end of the Cold War and the temptation to coast that conventional success may bring, Clancy has lost none of his verve. As cultural artifact, the book suggests a domestic America that is perilous and grim.&quot; In a mixed review written by Oliver Stone for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stone praised Clancy&#x27;s &quot;fiendishly inventive&quot; plotting and &quot;a technically sharp command of the realistic detail&quot;; however, he criticized its length, questioning whether Clancy&#x27;s works are edited or kept in their place: &quot;Realism comes at the expense of the story&#x27;s flow, and here I must ask whether anyone actually &quot;edits&quot; Mr. Clancy, or for that matter whether there is any living workaholic who actually reads every cybernetic paragraph, with its obligatory expressions of grief, anger, fear and that little bit of love that in Mr. Clancy&#x27;s world can be taken to mean &quot;responsibility.&quot;&quot;

<doc id="210522" wikidata="Q582577" url="?curid=210522" title="Economic policy">
<text>The economy of governments covers the systems for setting levels of taxation, government budgets, the money supply and interest rates as well as the labour market, national ownership, and many other areas of government interventions into the economy.

Most factors of economic policy can be divided into either fiscal policy, which deals with government actions regarding taxation and spending, or monetary policy, which deals with central banking actions regarding the money supply and interest rates.

Such policies are often influenced by international institutions like the International Monetary Fund or World Bank as well as political beliefs and the consequent policies of parties.

==Types of economic policy==
Almost every aspect of government has an important economic component. A few examples of the kinds of economic policies that exist include:
*Macroeconomic stabilization policy, which attempts to keep the money supply growing at a rate that does not result in excessive inflation, and attempts to smooth out the business cycle.
*Trade policy, which refers to tariffs, trade agreements and the international institutions that govern them.
*Policies designed to create economic growth
**Policies related to development economics
*Policies dealing with the redistribution of income, property and/or wealth
*As well as: regulatory policy, anti-trust policy, industrial policy and technology-based economic development policy

==Macroeconomic stabilization policy==
Stabilization policy attempts to stimulate an economy out of recession or constrain the money supply to prevent excessive inflation.
*Fiscal policy, often tied to Keynesian economics, uses government spending and taxes to guide the economy.
**Fiscal stance: The size of the deficit or surplus
**Tax policy: The taxes used to collect government income.
**Government spending on just about any area of government
*Monetary policy controls the value of currency by lowering the supply of money to control inflation and raising it to stimulate economic growth. It is concerned with the amount of money in circulation and, consequently, interest rates and inflation.
**Interest rates, if set by the Government
**Incomes policies and price controls that aim at imposing non-monetary controls on inflation
**Reserve requirements which affect the money multiplier

==Tools and goals==
Policy is generally directed to achieve particular objectives, like targets for inflation, unemployment, or economic growth. Sometimes other objectives, like military spending or nationalization are important.

These are referred to as the policy goals: the outcomes which the economic policy aims to achieve.

To achieve these goals, governments use policy tools which are under the control of the government. These generally include the interest rate and money supply, tax and government spending, tariffs, exchange rates, labor market regulations, and many other aspects of government.

===Selecting tools and goals===

Government and central banks are limited in the number of goals they can achieve in the short term. For instance, there may be pressure on the government to reduce inflation, reduce unemployment, and reduce interest rates while maintaining currency stability. If all of these are selected as goals for the short term, then policy is likely to be incoherent, because a normal consequence of reducing inflation and maintaining currency stability is increasing unemployment and increasing interest rates.

===Demand-side vs. supply-side tools===

This dilemma can in part be resolved by using microeconomic supply-side policy to help adjust markets. For instance, unemployment could potentially be reduced by altering laws relating to trade unions or unemployment insurance, as well as by macroeconomic (demand-side) factors like interest rates.

==Discretionary policy vs policy rules==
For much of the 20th century, governments adopted discretionary policies like demand management designed to correct the business cycle. These typically used fiscal and monetary policy to adjust inflation, output and unemployment.

However, following the stagflation of the 1970s, policymakers began to be attracted to policy rules. 

A discretionary policy is supported because it allows policymakers to respond quickly to events. However, discretionary policy can be subject to dynamic inconsistency: a government may say it intends to raise interest rates indefinitely to bring inflation under control, but then relax its stance later. This makes policy non-credible and ultimately ineffective.

A rule-based policy can be more credible, because it is more transparent and easier to anticipate. Examples of rule-based policies are fixed exchange rates, interest rate rules, the stability and growth pact and the Golden Rule. Some policy rules can be imposed by external bodies, for instance, the Exchange Rate Mechanism for currency. 

A compromise between strict discretionary and strict rule-based policy is to grant discretionary power to an independent body. For instance, the Federal Reserve Bank, European Central Bank, Bank of England and Reserve Bank of Australia all set interest rates without government interference, but do not adopt rules.

Another type of non-discretionary policy is a set of policies that are imposed by an international body. This can occur (for example) as a result of intervention by the International Monetary Fund.

==Economic policy through history==
The first economic problem was how to gain the resources it needed to be able to perform the functions of an early government: the military, roads and other projects like building the Pyramids.

Early governments generally relied on tax in kind and forced labor for their economic resources. However, with the development of money came the first policy choice. A government could raise money through taxing its citizens. However, it could now also debase the coinage and so increase the money supply. 

Early civilizations also made decisions about whether to permit and how to tax trade. Some early civilizations, such as Ptolemaic Egypt adopted a closed currency policy whereby foreign merchants had to exchange their coin for local money. This effectively levied a very high tariff on foreign trade.

By the early modern age, more policy choices had been developed. There was considerable debate about mercantilism and other restrictive trade practices like the Navigation Acts, as trade policy became associated with both national wealth and with foreign and colonial policy.

Throughout the 19th century, monetary standards became an important issue. Gold and silver were in supply in different proportions. Which metal was adopted influenced the wealth of different groups in society.

===The first fiscal policy===
With the accumulation of private capital in the Renaissance, states developed methods of financing deficits without debasing their coin. The development of capital markets meant that a government could borrow money to finance war or expansion while causing less economic hardship. 

This was the beginning of modern fiscal policy.

The same markets made it easy for private entities to raise bonds or sell stock to fund private initiatives.

===Business cycles===
The business cycle became a predominant issue in the 19th century, as it became clear that industrial output, employment, and profit behaved in a cyclical manner. One of the first proposed policy solutions to the problem came with the work of Keynes, who proposed that fiscal policy could be used actively to ward off depressions, recessions and slumps. The Austrian School of economics argues that central banks create the business cycle. After the dominance of monetarism and neoclassical thought that advised limiting the role of government in the economy in the second half of the twentieth century, the interventionist view has once more dominated the economic policy debate in response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis,

=== Evidence-based policy ===
A recent trend originating from medicine is to justify economic policy decisions with best available evidence. While the previous approaches have been focused on macroeconomic policymaking aimed at sustaining promoting economic development and counteracting recessions, EBP is oriented towards all types of decisions concerned not only with anti-cyclical development but primarily with the growth-promoting policies. To gather evidence for such decisions, economists conduct randomized field experiments. The work of Banerjee, Duflo, and Kremer, the 2019 Nobel Prize laureates exemplifies the gold type of evidence. However, the emphasis put on experimental evidence by the movement of evidence-based policy (and evidence-based medicine) results from the narrowly construed notion of intervention, which encompasses only policy decisions concerned with policymaking aimed at modifying causes to influence effects. In contrast to this idealized view of evidence-based policy movement, economic policymaking is a broader term that includes also institutional reforms and actions that do not require causal claims to be neutral under interventions. Such policy decisions can be grounded in, respectively, mechanistic evidence and correlational (econometric) studies.

<text>Lee Shelton (March 16, 1865 – March 11, 1912), popularly known as &quot;Stagolee&quot;, &quot;Stagger Lee&quot;, &quot;Stack-O-Lee&quot;, and other variations, was an American criminal who became a figure of folklore after murdering Billy Lyons on December 25, 1895. The murder, reportedly motivated partially by the theft of Shelton&#x27;s Stetson hat, made Shelton an icon of toughness and style in the minds of early folk and blues musicians, and inspired the popular folk song &quot;Stagger Lee&quot;. The story endures in the many versions of the song that have circulated since the late 19th century.

==Background==

The historical Lee Shelton was an African American man born in 1865 in Texas. He later worked as a carriage driver in St. Louis, Missouri, where he gained a reputation as a pimp and gambler, and evidently served as a captain in a black &quot;Four Hundred Club&quot;, a political and social club with a dubious reputation. He was not a common pimp — as described by Cecil Brown, &quot;Lee Shelton belonged to a group of pimps known in St. Louis as the &#x27;Macks.&#x27; The Macks were not just &#x27;urban strollers;&#x27; they presented themselves as objects to be observed. He was nicknamed &quot;Stag Lee&quot; or &quot;Stack Lee&quot;, possibly because he &quot;went stag&quot;, meaning he was without friends, or took the nickname from a well-known riverboat captain called &quot;Stack Lee&quot;. John and Alan Lomax claimed that the nickname came from a riverboat owned by the Lee family of Memphis called the &quot;Stack Lee,&quot; which was known for its on-board prostitution. Lee Shelton&#x27;s nickname was later corrupted into various other forms in the folk tradition.

On Christmas night in 1895, Shelton shot William &quot;Billy&quot; Lyons in a St. Louis saloon following a dispute. A story appearing in the St. Louis &quot;Globe-Democrat&quot; in 1895 read:
William Lyons, 25, a levee hand, was shot in the abdomen yesterday evening at 10 o&#x27;clock in the saloon of Bill Curtis, at Eleventh and Morgan Streets, by Lee Sheldon [sic], a carriage driver. Lyons and Sheldon were friends and were talking together. Both parties, it seems, had been drinking and were feeling in exuberant spirits. The discussion drifted to politics, and an argument was started, the conclusion of which was that Lyons snatched Sheldon&#x27;s hat from his head. The latter indignantly demanded its return. Lyons refused, and Sheldon withdrew his revolver and shot Lyons in the abdomen. When his victim fell to the floor Sheldon took his hat from the hand of the wounded man and coolly walked away. He was subsequently arrested and locked up at the Chestnut Street Station. Lyons was taken to the Dispensary, where his wounds were pronounced serious. Lee Sheldon is also known as &#x27;Stag&#x27; Lee.

Further details are preserved in trial accounts. For example, Shelton had first crushed Lyons&#x27; Derby hat, after which Lyons grabbed Shelton&#x27;s hat and demanded restitution; Shelton then drew his gun and smacked Lyons on the head with it. Lyons lunged for Shelton and Shelton shot.

Lyons eventually died of his injuries. Shelton was tried and convicted for the crime in 1897, and sentenced to 25 years in prison. He was paroled in 1909, but was imprisoned again two years later for assault and robbery. Unable to get parole, he died in the hospital of the Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson City on March 11, 1912, from tuberculosis.

Shelton is buried at the historic Greenwood Cemetery in Hillsdale, Missouri. The Killer Blues Headstone Project raised money to place a stone on his unmarked grave, and on April 14, 2013, a marker was laid during a public ceremony.

==Song and tradition==

Shortly after the event, the murder became the subject of folk song tradition, known as &quot;Stagolee&quot;, &quot;Stagger Lee&quot;, and other variants. The first evidence for it is a reference to &quot;Stack-a-Lee&quot; being performed by &quot;Prof. Charlie Lee, the piano thumper&quot; in the &quot;Kansas City Leavenworth Herald&quot; in 1897. The song was well known in African American communities along the lower Mississippi River by 1910. That year, musicologist John Lomax received a partial transcription of the song, and in 1911 two versions were published in the &quot;Journal of American Folklore&quot; by the sociologist and historian Howard W. Odum.

The song was first recorded by Waring&#x27;s Pennsylvanians in 1923, and became a hit. Another version was recorded later that year by Frank Westphal &amp; His Regal Novelty Orchestra, and Herb Wiedoeft and his band recorded the song in 1924. Also in 1924, the first version with lyrics was recorded, as &quot;Skeeg-a-Lee Blues&quot;, by Lovie Austin. Ma Rainey recorded the song the following year, with Louis Armstrong on cornet, and a notable version was recorded by Frank Hutchison in 1927.

The song tradition embellishes the story with sometimes inaccurate or fantastic details. The songs play up the importance of Stagolee&#x27;s Stetson hat as a symbol of manliness. he is often said to have received a death sentence for his crime, which he accepts stoically. Some versions add an additional section in which Stagolee goes to Hell and usurps it from the Devil. The 1995 version by Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds paints Stagger Lee as a sociopathic, bisexual sexual predator who forces a foe to perform fellatio on him before shooting the man to death.

In 2004, The Black Keys included a song on their third album, &quot;Rubber Factory&quot;, titled &quot;Stack Shot Billy&quot;, telling the tale of the infamous murder. Frontman Dan Auerbach drew inspiration from his heavy blues background, playing the song in open G tuning, finger plucking on an old telecaster.

==Impact==
Stagger Lee has become an archetype with some black people who admire the gangster type; a parallel to the glorification of the outlaw by a section of mainstream society. In this variation, he is the embodiment of a tough black man; one who is sly, streetwise, cool, lawless, amoral, potentially violent, and who defies white authority.

Within thirty years of Shelton&#x27;s death, Benjamin Botkin records stories among the superstitious of his having been born with a caul over his face (signifying one with the power to see spirits and destined for trouble), or of having sold his soul to the Devil (in exchange for the hat, said to be magic, over which he killed Billy Lyons). Additional fantastic legends credit him with the ability to transform himself into animals, of having caused the San Francisco earthquake, and of having fought a duel with Jesse James.

Author and music critic Greil Marcus explicitly ties the Stagger Lee archetype to Sly Stone and his album &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot; in his book &quot;Mystery Train: Images of America in Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Music.&quot;

From 1982 to 1984, two masked professional wrestlers were billed as Stagger Lee in the Southern US; Sylvester Ritter, better known as Junkyard Dog, played him first in Mid-South Wrestling and James Ware, who became Koko B. Ware, followed suit in the Continental Wrestling Association.

Dallas Theater Center in Dallas produced an original musical with an adaptation of the folklore around Stagger Lee and Billy Lyons. The characters explore African American history in the Northern United States, and experience racism and violence throughout multiple cities. It opened January 21, 2015 and featured Brandon Gill, J. Bernard Calloway, Tiffany Mann, Cedric Neal, and Saycon Sengbloh.

Damon Runyon references the song in his 1920’s short story &quot;Broadway Financier&quot;, where the song is called &#x27;Stacker Lee.&#x27;

In 2006, Image Comics published the graphic novel &quot;Stagger Lee,&quot; written by Derek McCulloch and illustrated by Shepherd Hendrix, examining the historical murder of Lyons by Shelton, and the folklore that came out of it, in the framing setting of a fictionalized version of the African-American community in Saint Louis.

HarperCollins published &quot;A Lush and Seething Hell&quot; by John Horner Jacobs in 2019. Consisting of two novellas, the latter – &quot;My Heart Struck Sorrow&quot; – focuses in large part on a horrific mystery connected to varied acetate recordings made in the 1930s as well as the folklore surrounding &quot;Stagger Lee&quot;.

<doc id="210524" wikidata="Q3982614" url="?curid=210524" title="Tejas and Jayhawk">
<text>Tejas was a code name for Intel&#x27;s microprocessor, which was to be a successor to the latest Pentium 4 with the Prescott core and was sometimes referred to as Pentium V. Jayhawk was a code name for its Xeon counterpart. The cancellation of the processors in May 2004 underscored Intel&#x27;s historical transition of its focus on single-core processors to multi-core processors.

==History==
In early 2003, Intel showed Tejas and a plan to release it sometime in 2004 with possible delays into 2005. Its development however, was cancelled on May 7, 2004. Analysts attribute these issues to heat and power consumption problems due to Intel&#x27;s goal of reaching ever higher clock speeds, at the detriment of work done per clock (and therefore performance per clock). This was already the case with Prescott and its mediocre performance increase over Northwood despite higher clock speeds, not to mention heavy competition from Advanced Micro Devices with their Athlon 64. Prescott was supposed to attain &gt;5 GHz speeds with ease, yet this was not possible due to physical limitations such as heat generated and power consumed at ambient temperatures (the &quot;power wall&quot;). Tejas went even further ahead with this paradigm, with Intel targeting 10 GHz clock speeds by 2011 trying to fulfill the prediction made by Andrew Grove in his keynote speech at the 1996 COMDEX/Fall. Soon enough it was clear this represented a dead end.

This cancellation reflected Intel&#x27;s intention to focus on dual-core chips for the Itanium platform. With respect to desktop processors, Intel&#x27;s development efforts shifted to the Pentium M microarchitecture (itself a derivative of the P6 microarchitecture last used in the Pentium III) used in the Centrino notebook platform, which offered greatly improved performance per watt compared to Prescott and other NetBurst designs. The result of modernizing the P6 microarchitecture was the Core processor line, and later the Core 2 line, offering Intel&#x27;s first native dual core products for desktops and laptops while regaining the performance crown back from AMD.

This defined the end for the NetBurst architecture, with Core setting the foundation and path for power efficient architectures that followed along the Tick–tock model. Although NetBurst was a dead end for the company, its concepts were later reused and repurposed in Sandy Bridge.

To bridge the gap left by Tejas&#x27; cancellation in the x86 market, Intel did one last revision to NetBurst, codenamed Cedar Mill (single core) and Presler (dual core).

==Design and microarchitecture==
Tejas and Jayhawk were to make several improvements on the Pentium 4&#x27;s NetBurst microarchitecture. Tejas was originally to be built on a 90 nm process, later moving to a 65 nm process. The 90 nm version of the processor was reported to have 1 MB L2 cache, while the 65 nm chip would increase the cache to 2 MB. There was also to be a dual core version of Tejas called &quot;Cedarmill&quot; (or &quot;Cedar Mill&quot; depending on the source). This &quot;Cedarmill&quot; should not be confused with the 65 nm Cedar Mill-based Pentium 4, which appears to be what the codename was recycled for.

The trace cache capacity would likely have been increased, and the number of pipeline stages was increased to between 40 and 50 stages. There would have been an improved version of Hyper-Threading, as well as a new version of SSE, which was later backported to the Intel Core 2 series and named SSSE3. Tejas was slated to operate at frequencies of 7 GHz or higher. However, it&#x27;s likely that Tejas wouldn&#x27;t have had linear performance scaling, as it would on average have executed fewer instructions per clock cycle due to more pipeline bubbles from branch mispredicts and data cache misses. Also, it would have run hotter as well with a TDP much higher than the Prescott core of Pentium 4. The CPU was cancelled late in its development after it had reached its tapeout phase.

Initial claims reported early samples of single core 90 nm Tejas running at 2.8 GHz and rated for 150 W TDP on the LGA 775 socket, a notable increase over single core 90 nm Prescott (Pentium 4 521, 2.8 GHz, 84 W TDP) and higher than 90 nm dual core Smithfield (Pentium D 820, 2.8 GHz, 95 W TDP). In contrast, 65 nm dual core Core 2 Duo processors had a maximum of 65 W TDP (E6850, 3.00 GHz) while being much more efficient with markedly higher performance per clock.

However, the existence of engineering samples have been challenged and no source indicates that tape-out of Tejas ever existed - the sample shown in the AnandTech article being a Prescott B0 ES. Most probably only thermal samples of Tejas were produced.

<doc id="210529" wikidata="Q902566" url="?curid=210529" title="List of Catholic dioceses in Ireland">
<text>This is a comprehensive list of Catholic dioceses in the island of Ireland. Catholicism in Ireland only maintains a Latin Church hierarchy, encompassing both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, having been unaffected by the partition of Ireland in 1920–22. There are no Eastern Catholic jurisdictions, nor other exempt ordinariates.

There are 26 dioceses in Ireland, each led by a diocesan bishop (including four Metropolitan Archdioceses). They are organised into a single all-island Episcopal Conference that is based in the primatial see of Armagh. 
The Holy See is represented by the Apostolic Nuncio to Ireland. A separate Apostolic Nunciature in London represents the Holy See in England, Wales and Scotland.

==Structural changes over the years==
The diocesan system of Christian church government in Ireland was set up by the Synod of Rathbreasail in 1111 and modified by the Synod of Kells in 1152, replacing the earlier Celtic Christian monastic model. The island of Ireland is divided into four ecclesiastical provinces each headed by a metropolitan archbishop. The provinces were almost co-extensive with their contemporary civil counterparts. After the 
Reformation in Ireland, both the Protestant Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church saw themselves as successors to the pre-Reformation church. Most bishops were non-resident during the enforcement of the Penal Laws, but the dioceses continued to exist. Whereas English Catholic dioceses were forbidden by law from having the same name as a diocese of the established Church of England, no such prohibition was made for Irish dioceses.

The Roman Catholic dioceses remained close to the original, with a few notable differences. Firstly, several dioceses with small populations were merged, and now have more than one name to represent their merger. Secondly, the Diocese of Galway was created in 1831 following the abolition of the Wardenship of Galway.

James Butler 2nd, the Archbishop of Cashel and Emly (1774–91), on being appointed by Rome moved his residence and cathedra from Cashel, favouring Thurles instead, where his successors continue to reign today. Similarly, in the Diocese of Elphin, the Cathedral, which was originally established in the County Roscommon town of Elphin, is now in Sligo.

Another change is that the ancient see of Kilfenora has been administered by the Bishop of Galway in the province of Tuam since the late 19th Century. The correct title of the Bishop is now the Bishop of Galway and Kilmacduagh and Apostolic Administrator of Kilfenora. More recently, the Diocese of Ross merged with the Diocese of Cork to form the Diocese of Cork and Ross in the 1950s.

== Geographic boundaries ==
Unlike many (European) countries, the boundaries of the Roman Catholic dioceses in Ireland do not conform with the political border between the Republic of Ireland (independent) and Northern Ireland (part of the UK). One archdiocese and three dioceses straddle the international border; two dioceses are wholly in Northern Ireland.

* Metropolitan Archdiocese of Armagh (includes parts of counties Armagh, Louth, Londonderry and Tyrone)
*Diocese of Clogher (includes parts of counties Tyrone, Fermanagh and Monaghan )
*Diocese of Derry (includes parts of counties Londonderry, Antrim, Donegal, and Tyrone)
*Diocese of Kilmore (includes parts of County Fermanagh)
*Diocese of Down and Connor (in Northern Ireland)
*Diocese of Dromore (in Northern Ireland)

== Current dioceses ==
=== Ecclesiastical province of Armagh ===
Approximating the civil province of Ulster; mainly in Northern Ireland.

* Metropolitan Archdiocese of Armagh, primatial see of all Ireland – seat Northern Ireland, part in Republic of Ireland
**Diocese of Ardagh (united with the titular bishopric Clonmacnois) – Republic of Ireland only 
**Diocese of Clogher - seat in Republic of Ireland, part in Northern Ireland
**Diocese of Derry - seat Northern Ireland, part in Republic of Ireland
**Diocese of Down and Connor - Northern Ireland only
**Diocese of Dromore - Northern Ireland only
**Diocese of Kilmore - seat Republic of Ireland, part in Northern Ireland
**Diocese of Meath - Republic of Ireland only
**Diocese of Raphoe - Republic of Ireland only

=== Ecclesiastical province of Cashel ===
Approximating the civil province of Munster.
* Metropolitan Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly
**Diocese of Cloyne
**Diocese of Cork and Ross
**Diocese of Kerry
**Diocese of Killaloe
**Diocese of Limerick
**Diocese of Waterford and Lismore

=== Ecclesiastical province of Dublin ===
Approximating the civil province of Leinster.

* Metropolitan Archdiocese of Dublin
**Diocese of Ferns
**Diocese of Kildare and Leighlin
**Diocese of Ossory

=== Ecclesiastical province of Tuam ===
Approximating the civil province of Connacht.
* Metropolitan Archdiocese of Tuam
**Diocese of Achonry
**Diocese of Clonfert
**Diocese of Elphin
**Diocese of Galway and Kilmacduagh and Kilfenora 
**Diocese of Killala

As the Diocese of Kilfenora is in the Ecclesiastical province of Cashel, the Bishop of Galway and Kilmacduagh is its apostolic administrator rather than bishop.

== Former dioceses ==
There are seventeen titular sees in Ireland (of which two are united in personal union with current sees): Ardcarne, Ardmore, Ath Truim, Ceanannus Mór, Cell Ausaille, Cill Fhionnúrach (united with Galway and Kilmacduagh), Clonmacnoise (united with Diocese of Ardagh), Cluain Iraird, Cunga Féichin, Domnach Sechnaill, Duleek, Eanach Dúin, Glenndálocha, Inis Cathaig, Louth, Mageó, Roscrea, Slebte, Árd Sratha (formerly as Ardstraw an abbey nullius becoming a diocese, merged into Diocese of Cinél nEógain and Ardstraw; territory now in diocese Derry).

<text>The following is a list of non-international armed conflicts, fought between territorial and/or intervening state forces and non-state armed groups or between non-state armed groups within the same state or country. The terms &quot;intrastate conflict&quot;, &quot;internecine conflict&quot;, &quot;internal conflict&quot; and &quot;civil war&quot; are often used interchangeably with &quot;non-international armed conflict&quot;, but &quot;internecine war&quot; can be used in a wider meaning, referring to any conflict within a single state, regardless of the participation of civil state or non-state forces. Thus, any war of succession is by definition an internecine war, but not necessarily a non-international armed conflict.

==Terminology==
The Latin term &quot;bellum civile&quot;, meaning in English, civil war, was used to describe wars within a single community beginning around 60 A.D. The term is an alternative title for the work sometimes called &quot;Pharsalia&quot; by Lucan (Marcus Annaeus Lucanus) about the Roman civil wars that began in the last third of the second century BC. The term &quot;civilis&quot; here had the very specific meaning of &#x27;Roman citizen&#x27;. Since the 17th century, the term has also been applied retroactively to other historical conflicts where at least one side claims to represent the country&#x27;s civil society (rather than a feudal dynasty or an imperial power).

Since 1949, the term &quot;non-international armed conflict&quot; has been widely used to refer to armed conflict between territorial and/or intervening state forces and non-state armed groups or between non-state armed groups within the same state or country, instead of civil war. The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)&#x27;s Arms Unit, Kathleen Lawand, stated &quot;The ICRC generally avoids using the term &#x27;civil war&#x27; when communicating with the parties to an armed conflict or publicly, and speaks instead of &#x27;non-international&#x27; or &#x27;internal&#x27; armed conflicts, as these expressions mirror the terms used in common Article 3 [of the 1949 Geneva Conventions].&quot;

==Ongoing non-international armed conflicts==

The following non-international armed conflicts are ongoing as of April 2023. Only ongoing conflicts which meet the definition of a non-international armed conflict are listed. See List of ongoing armed conflicts and lists of active separatist movements for lists with a wider scope.

<text>In biology, a nymph (from Ancient Greek &quot;nūmphē&quot; meaning &quot;bride&quot;) is the juvenile form of some invertebrates, particularly insects, which undergoes gradual metamorphosis (hemimetabolism) before reaching its adult stage. Unlike a typical larva, a nymph&#x27;s overall form already resembles that of the adult, except for a lack of wings (in winged species) and the emergence of genitalia. In addition, while a nymph moults, it never enters a pupal stage. Instead, the final moult results in an adult insect. Nymphs undergo multiple stages of development called instars.

== Species with nymph stages ==
Many species of arthropods have nymph stages. This includes the orders Orthoptera (crickets, grasshoppers and locusts), Hemiptera (cicadas, shield bugs, whiteflies, aphids, leafhoppers, froghoppers, treehoppers), mayflies, termites, cockroaches, mantises, stoneflies and Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies).

Nymphs of aquatic insects, as in the Odonata, Ephemeroptera, and Plecoptera orders, are also called &quot;naiads&quot;, an Ancient Greek name for mythological water nymphs. Some entomologists have said that the terms larva, nymph and naiad should be used according to the developmental mode classification (hemimetabolous, paurometabolous or holometabolous) but others have pointed out that there is no real confusion. In older literature, these were sometimes referred to as the heterometabolous insects, as their adult and immature stages live in different environments (terrestrial vs. aquatic).

== Second Egg Hypothesis ==
In 1628, English physician William Harvey published &quot;An Anatomical Disquisition on the Motion of the Heart and Blood in Animals.&quot; In his writing, Harvey hypothesized that the pupal stage in insects was the result of imperfect eggs. While some eggs produced smaller versions of fully-matured insects known as nymphs, others created intermediate forms. Thus, these intermediate forms must go through a second egg stage to reach their adult form. This hypothesis attempts to explain the developmental differences between hemimetabolous and holometabolous metamorphosis. Though there is little evidence supporting Harvey&#x27;s hypothesis, it is still significant to modern research in nymphs.

== Relationship with humans ==

In fly fishing with artificial flies, this stage of aquatic insects is the basis for an entire series of representative patterns for trout. They account for over half of the fishing fly patterns regularly used in the United States.

<doc id="210534" wikidata="Q23060" url="?curid=210534" title="Liberal Party (Hong Kong)">
<text>The Liberal Party (LP) is a pro-Beijing, pro-business, and conservative political party in Hong Kong. Led by Tommy Cheung and chaired by Peter Shiu, it holds four seats in the Legislative Council, and holds five seats in the District Councils.

Founded in 1993 on the basis of the Co-operative Resources Centre, the Liberal Party was founded by a group of conservative politicians, businessmen and professionals who were either appointed by the colonial governor or indirectly elected through the trade-based functional constituencies, to counter the liberal United Democrats of Hong Kong who emerged from the first Legislative Council direct election in 1991.

Led by Allen Lee, the party adopted a friendly approach with the Beijing authorities to oppose last governor Chris Patten&#x27;s constitutional reform proposal in the final colonial years. Enjoyed by the advantage in the narrowly-franchised functional constituencies, the Liberals remained a major party and a governing ally of the SAR administration in the early post-handover era, despite its chairman Allen Lee&#x27;s failed attempt in the direct election.

The Liberal popularity rose to its peak in 2003 when party chairman James Tien broke away from the government to voice against the Basic Law Article 23 which eventually brought down the proposed bill. The Liberal Party enjoyed an electoral success in the 2004 Legislative Council election where James Tien and vice chairwoman Selina Chow both won a seat in the direct election, bringing the party 10 seats in the legislature. Although the Liberal Party sits with the pro-establishment camp in the Legislative Council, it took a more ambiguous and sometimes rebellious stance against the SAR government under Tien&#x27;s more moderate leadership and was called a &quot;wall-rider&quot; party in Hong Kong political discourse for swaying between supporting the pro-Beijing SAR administration and the voters on certain issues.

The party lost both of its directly elected seats in the 2008 Legislative Council election and led to the split within the party where four of its seven legislators left the party. In the 2012 Chief Executive election, the Liberals openly opposed Leung Chun-ying who became the eventual winner with Beijing&#x27;s blessing. The party was then increasingly sidelined by the administration. In 2014, party leader James Tien was unseated from CPPCC for asking Leung to step down.

The Liberals lost their only directly elected seat when Tien retired in 2016, dwindling to four seats in the legislature. The party was divided in the 2017 Chief Executive election when the wing led by former party leader James Tien supported Financial Secretary John Tsang while the wing led by party chairman and Executive Councillor Tommy Cheung voted for Chief Secretary Carrie Lam who was Beijing&#x27;s favourite. The party became further polarized over the proposed extradition bill controversy and the 9 June protest with Tien&#x27;s faction wanting to scrap the bill and calling for Lam&#x27;s resignation while the new Liberal Party leadership expressed their support for Lam. Some members of Tien&#x27;s moderate faction founded the Hope for Hong Kong organisation to explore a middle ground between the pro-Beijing and pro-democracy camps. Tien&#x27;s faction were later forced out from the party when the central committee decided to scrap the titles of honorary chairperson in August 2022.

==Party beliefs==
Formed by businessmen and tycoons from various business sectors in Hong Kong, the Liberal Party is considered conservative and pro-business. In reference to the Liberal Party name, founding chairman Allen Lee said that &quot;liberalism&quot; would be the party&#x27;s cherished ideal, with its values being free enterprise, equal opportunity, and individual freedom, but it expounds liberal conservative economic policies such as opposition to a minimum wage, collective bargaining and antitrust legislation. The Liberals also support limited government, low taxes, a high degree of economic freedom and uphold the interests of small and medium enterprises. Early on, the Liberal Party was close to the British administration with some of the party&#x27;s founders being appointed to roles within the colonial government. However, the party shifted towards the pro-Beijing camp in the run-up to the handover of Hong Kong due to electoral reforms enacted by the British administration and the rise of the pro-democracy camp which the party claimed would threaten a smooth transition of power and economic relations with mainland China.

The party does not advocate welfare entitlements. Many of its members are from professionals, the merchant and business sectors and see preserving the current state of economic freedom as most advantageous for Hong Kong as a whole. The party adheres to social conservatism and opposes same-sex marriage. The party supported the functional constituency which represented the business interest that they should stay in the Legislative Council.

Despite being regarded as part of the pro-Beijing camp, the relations between Liberal Party and Hong Kong SAR government is not extremely friendly and the party has not shied away from criticising SAR administrations on some measures. Its chairman James Tien&#x27;s resignation from the Executive Council in 2003 forced the government to back down from legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law, which ultimately accelerated the downfall of the Tung Chee-hwa administration. It has remained critical of the government of Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying who won in the 2012 chief executive election, which the Liberal Party supported Leung&#x27;s rival Henry Tang and cast blank votes instead of voting for Leung. On some issues, the Liberal Party has either adopted a neutral stance or has swung between supporting the pro-Beijing camp and voters, prompting dissatisfied responses from both sides although the party has generally positioned itself as supportive of the SAR government. After Carrie Lam was elected as Chief Executive, the party was accused of growing closer to the government and further from the founding members of the party and the leadership of James Tien. During the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests the party was divided on whether to support the 2019 Hong Kong extradition bill, with former party leader Felix Chung arguing the SAR government should not rush into passing such a legislation while Tommy Cheung supported it. Others such as Tien argued for Lam to resign as Chief Executive. Due to its history of rebelling against the government, it is also seen as maverick in the pro-Beijing camp.

==History==

===Background===
The Liberal Party was founded on the basis of a loose political grouping Co-operative Resources Centre (CRC) in 1993. The Co-operative Resources Centre was formed by the conservative faction in the Legislative Council (LegCo) as a counter-force to the new emerged pro-democratic United Democrats of Hong Kong who won a landslide victory in the first Legislative Council direct elections in 1991. Led by the Senior Unofficial Member Allen Lee and his fellow LegCo colleagues, Steven Poon, Selina Chow and Stephen Cheong, 12 legislators appointed by the British colonial government and 8 legislators indirectly elected by the functional constituencies aligned themselves and formed the CRC as a think tank, research unit and brain trust for a future political group. Four of the legislative council members, Allen Lee, Selina Chow, Rita Fan and Edward Ho had also been appointed members of the Executive Council (ExCo). This group of conservative elites shared a dislike for the United Democrats but lacked a common philosophy and ambition. Sir Sze Yuen Chung, the former senior unofficial member of the executive and legislative councils, suggested Lee and Poon to abandon any pretense of being above politics and form a proper political party with its belief, vision, discipline and platform.

===Founding and Allen Lee chairmanship (1993–1998)===

The Liberal Party was officially launched on 6 June 1993 with Allen Lee and Ronald Arculli as the first chairman and vice-chairman. The party was originally considered close to the British colonial administration in part due to its scepticism of expanding universal suffrage, but wishing to see a smooth transition of sovereignty over Hong Kong, the Liberal Party strongly opposed Governor Chris Patten&#x27;s democratic reform as it was seen as a violation Sino-British Joint Declaration by the PRC government and began to align itself more to the pro-Beijing camp as a result. The Liberal Party offered an amendment to the reform package known as the &quot;1994 Plan&quot; which was supported by Beijing, but this was defeated in the legislative council.

The Liberal Party fielded candidates for the first time in the 1994 District Board elections, reaping 18 seats. In the 1995 Legislative Council election, Chairman Allen Lee successfully gained the party&#x27;s first seat in the New Territories North-east direct election with nine other seats gained in the indirect functional constituency elections, focused on business interests. The party has maintained its unbalanced advantages in the business sector&#x27;s indirect elections in functional constituencies while having few success in the popular direct elections in geographical constituencies. During the last years of British rule and early years of the SAR administration, the party remained one of the three largest in Legco, behind the pro-democratic Democratic Party and ahead of the Beijing-loyalist Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB).

In January 1996, Allen Lee, Lau Wong-fat, Howard Young and Ngai Shiu-kit were invited by the Beijing government to the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong SAR. Fourteen Liberal Party members including Allen Lee, Ronald Arculli and James Tien subsequently became members of the 400-member Selection Committee which was responsible for electing the first chief executive of Hong Kong and the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) in November. 10 members were elected to the Provisional Legislative Council and member Henry Tang was also appointed to the Provisional Executive Council by Chief Executive-elect Tung Chee-hwa in December 1996.

In May 1998, the Liberal Party participated in the first Legislative Council election after the handover, although the party won all of its 10 seats in the functional constituency and Election Committee indirect elections, Chairman Allen Lee lost in the New Territories East direct election. Lee decided not to run in 2000 and resigned as chairman in December. James Tien succeeded Lee as the new chairman and Arculli and Selina Chow were elected vice-chairmen.

===James Tien chairmanship and 2003 crisis (1998–2003)===
In the 1999 District Council elections, the Liberal Party won 16 elected seats, with James Tien and Howard Young elected in the Peak and Bays Area. The party also had 9 appointed seats and 2 &quot;ex officio&quot; seats, including chairman of the Tuen Mun Rural Committee Lau Wong-fat as the &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the Tuen Mun District Council. In the 2000 Legislative Council elections, 7 Liberal Party legislators were elected, with Tommy Cheung winning in the new Catering functional constituency. In September 2000, Miriam Lau became party&#x27;s vice-chairwoman after Ronald Arcullli announced that he would not run in the next legislative council elections and resigned as vice-chairman.

The Liberal Party had been the ally of the Tung Chee-hwa&#x27;s administration. In March 2000, Vice-chairwoman Selina Chow was appointed chair of the Hong Kong Tourist Association, which was later transformed into the Hong Kong Tourism Board. The Tourist Board was regarded as the fiefdom of the Liberals. After Selina Chow stepped down in 2007, James Tien was appointed by Donald Tsang to succeed her as the chair of the board. In July 2002 when chief executive Tung Chee-hwa carried out the Principal Officials Accountability System (POAS) in the beginning of his second term. Party chairman James Tien was appointed to the executive council alongside the DAB chairman Tsang Yok-sing as the coalition of the Tung administration. The former Liberal Party&#x27;s ExCo member Henry Tang was appointed Secretary for Commerce, Industry and Technology. However the governing coalition between Tung Chee-hwa the Beijing-loyalist DAB and the pro-business Liberal Party suffered from growing disunity as the popularity of Tung administration dropped. The Liberal Party was increasingly frustrated by unequal political exchange with the government and the skimpy political rewards meted out by Tung. James Tien even openly aired his displeasure and advocated power sharing with the government.

In September 2002, the SAR government issued the consultation document for the national security legislation to implement the Article 23 of the Basic Law, which outlaws treason, sedition, subversion and secession against the central government. The Liberal Party agreed the principle of safeguarding the national security but suggested amendments to the bill. After a record-breaking number of people demonstrated on 1 July 2003 against the Article 23, James Tien resigned from the executive council on 6 July 2003 to force the government to delay the legislation. Without Liberal Party&#x27;s support, the government was forced to shelve the second reading because of short of votes in the legislative council. This exception to the party&#x27;s usual pro-government policy was popular and temporarily calmed friction between pro-government and the pro-democracy forces. Some pro-Beijing leftists, however, felt that this demonstrated the opportunistic nature of the party. In September 2003, Tung Chee-hwa appointed Selina Chow to Executive Council to replace Tien&#x27;s vacancy.

===Liberal surge (2003–2008)===

In Liberal Party&#x27;s visit to Beijing in September 2003, the party expressed its opinion on Article 23 and its support to the SAR government. It subsequently changed its party logo and slogan, adding the red colour to express its patriotic sentiment. At almost the same time, the Liberal Party shifted its stance on political development from &quot;all Legislative Council members should be directly elected in 2007&quot; to &quot;Hong Kong should become more democratic.&quot; The founder and ex-chair of Liberal Party, Allen Lee, decided to leave the party since he believed the change was against public sentiment. The party&#x27;s stance on universal suffrage then became similar to that of the DAB, namely, that universal suffrage should be implemented in or after 2012 rather than in 2007/2008. The party won 14 elected seats in the District Council elections in November 2003.

The Liberal Party saw its greatest success in the 2004 Legislative Council election. With its success in gaining two seats from the geographical constituencies through direct elections, which chairman James Tien in New Territories East and Vice-chairwoman Selina Chow in New Territories West, while retaining those seats in the functional constituencies, the party increased its seats from 8 to 10, overtaking the Democratic Party for the first time since 1995 to become the second-largest political party in the legislature.

When Donald Tsang took over in November 2005, the party continued its generally pro-government stance and its warm relationship with Tsang administration. However the support for the chief executive could not be taken for granted. On 13 January 2006, the Liberal Party opposed Donald Tsang&#x27;s plan to implement a five-day working week for most civil servants, due to concerns that this would put too much pressure on small to medium-sized enterprises to follow suit. The change went ahead and was widely adopted in the private sector. There is no planned legislation to force private employers to commit to a five-day working week. The Liberal Party supported Donald Tsang in his 2007 chief executive re-election. In exchange, Tsang quickly appointed James Tien as the head of the Hong Kong Tourism Board after he was elected.

===2008 split (2008–2012)===
The fate of the party hung in the balance after its poor showing in the 2008 Legislative Council election. The party won seven seats, all in the functional constituencies, eliminating its limited public mandate; James Tien and Selina Chow both lost their geographical constituency seats, and both resigned their party functions. There were recriminations when Chow blamed the loss of her seat on Heung Yee Kuk chairman and Liberal Party member Lau Wong-fat for canvassing for the DAB during the elections. Former chairman Allen Lee said that the party was now &quot;doomed&quot; following their poll defeat because of a succession crisis and lack of funding. Miriam Lau succeeded Tien as the chairwoman of the party, while Tommy Cheung and Vincent Fang became vice-chairmen.

On 9 October 2008, three Legislative Councillors, Jeffrey Lam, Sophie Leung, and Andrew Leung, resigned from the party, citing internal party disagreements. Lam had been angling for the party leadership since Tien&#x27;s resignation and his candidacy was endorsed by all six Legislative Councillors until Miriam Lau stepped in the leadership election. These resignations, along with the resignation of Lau Wong-fat, reduced the Liberal Party from seven Legislative Councillors to three. The resigned four later formed Economic Synergy, which merged into the Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong today.

The debate over the minimum wage legislation in 2010 further caused intra-party conflicts. Vice-chairman Tommy Cheung who represented the catering employers&#x27; interests in the Catering functional constituency was under fire when he suggested that the first statutory minimum rate should just be HK$20 (US$2.5). To project its &quot;conscionable employer&quot; image, the party suggested that the statutory minimum wage should be HK$24 an hour and made a clean break with Cheung. On other hand, James Tien&#x27;s brother, Michael, split from the party after his position of backing a campaign to boycott Cafe de Coral over its plans to offer workers a pay rise if they gave up their right to a paid lunch break shocked the party ranks and was fiercely attacked by Tommy Cheung. As a result, Michael Tien split from the party in November and subsequently joined Regina Ip&#x27;s newly formed New People&#x27;s Party and Tommy Cheung also resigned as party&#x27;s vice-chairman. After Cheung&#x27;s resignation, James Tien and Selina Chow officially returned to the party leadership when Tien was appointed the honorary chairman in December 2010 and Chow succeeded Cheung as the vice-chairwoman for the second time in January 2011.

In the 2012 Chief Executive election, the Liberal Party was the high-profile supporter of Henry Tang, its former party member. After Henry Tang suffered from the illegal basement scandal, the party unanimously decided its Election Committee members could either vote for Henry Tang or cast blank votes, but not to vote for Leung Chun-ying. The party remained critical of Leung administration. In August 2013, James Tien described Leung as &quot;the worst chief executive so far&quot; on a talk show. In October 2013, the Liberal Party even joined the pan-democrats in signing a petition to urge the Leung administration to re-consider its decision to not give a free-to-air TV license to Hong Kong Television Network.

===Liberals under Leung government (2012–2017)===
The party rebounded its seats in the legislative council from 3 to 5 in the 2012 Hong Kong Legislative Council election with James Tien regained his direct elected seat in the New Territories East geographical constituency. However, Miriam Lau, who lost in her attempt in Hong Kong Island direct election, resigned as chairwoman. Following a three-month period with Vincent Fang as acting chairman, on 15 December 2012, Selina Chow was elected chairperson, unopposed. James Tien and Miriam Lau continued to serve as Honorary Chairpersons, while Fang and Felix Chung became vice-chairmen. It was also stated that a new party leader post would be created, along with three vice-chairmen to groom successors. A new post &quot;party leader&quot; was created in May 2013. James Tien was elected as the first party leader.

During the 2014 Hong Kong protests, James Tien called on Chief Executive CY Leung to resign, leading to the hearing of a call to eject him as a member of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Tien was formally stripped of his post at the meeting on 29 October, making him the first person in history to have received this sanction. Tien stepped down from his position as the leader of the Liberal Party after the removal. Tien and Selina Chow joined Miriam Lau to become the honorary chairmen in the following leadership election on 1 December while Vincent Fang and Felix Chung became the new Leader and chairman respectively and Eastern District Councillor Peter Shiu became the party&#x27;s vice-chairman. Although not holding any executive position in the party, Tien has remained the spokesman and &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Liberal Party.

In the 2016 Legislative Council election, party honorary chairman James Tien stood as a second candidate behind his young party member Dominic Lee. Both of them failed to retain the Liberals&#x27; only seat in the geographical constituencies. Although failing in ousting BPA&#x27;s Jeffrey Lam in Commercial (First), the Liberals retained other four trade-based functional constituencies with vice-chairman Peter Shiu succeeded the retiring party leader Vincent Fang&#x27;s Wholesale and Retail seat. The party&#x27;s New Territories West candidate Ken Chow Wing-kan announced he would withdraw from the race before the election due to an &quot;external force&quot; threatened him and his family.

The Liberal Party elected Felix Chung and Tommy Cheung as the new leader and chairman after the election in October, with CPPCC member Alan Hoo and Eastern District Councillor Lee Chun-keung elected as vice-chairmen along with Peter Shiu. The new leadership was seen as more moderate with less vocal anti-Leung Chun-ying stance. Cheung was subsequently appointed by Leung to the executive council. Although claiming he has gotten the endorsement from the party, Cheung&#x27;s move was criticised by Tien.

===Liberals in Lam government (2017–2022)===
In the 2017 Chief Executive election, the Liberals were split between former Chief Secretary Carrie Lam and former Financial Secretary John Tsang. The party honorary chairman James Tien was first of the few pro-Beijing electors to publicly endorse Tsang. Honorary chairwoman Selina Chow and leader Felix Chung also endorsed Tsang, making the Liberal Party the only pro-Beijing party to nominate Tsang, although some Liberal electors such as chairman Tommy Cheung nominated Lam.

The Carrie Lam administration reached out to the Liberals when she appointed two Liberal members, Joseph Chan and Mark Fu into the government as Political Assistants. The Liberal Party lost its own seat in the National People&#x27;s Congress after incumbent Miriam Lau retired from the national legislature and its candidate Nicholas Chan Hiu-fung failed to gain a seat in the 2017 election. As supplementary member, Chan became the delegate after Peter Wong Man-kong died in March 2019.

The Liberal leadership was deeply divided over the extradition bill controversy in 2019. After the 9 June protest which drew over a million people marching in the streets as the organisers claimed, the Carrie Lam administration issued a statement it was determined to resume the debate on the bill in the legislative council. The Liberal Party quickly followed and issued its own statement in support of the government. However, former party chairman and leader James Tien had been outspoken for his opposition to the bill. On 8 July when the government finally backed down as Carrie Lam declared the bill was dead, James Tien and three other honorary chairmen of the party, Selina Chow, Miriam Lau and Vincent Fang called on Tommy Cheung who was an executive councillor at Lam&#x27;s cabinet to resign as he failed to relay public opposition to the bill, but was refused by Cheung. James Tien publicly called for the resignation of Carrie Lam as chief executive.

In 2020, members of the moderate Tien faction also announced the foundation of the Hope for Hong Kong organisation after accusing the Liberal Party&#x27;s leadership of growing too close to Beijing which aimed to explore a middle ground between the pro-Beijing and pro-democracy camps.

=== Expulsion of Tien faction (2022–present) ===
In the 2021 legislative election, Felix Chung, member of the Tien faction, was defeated in his constituency of Textiles and Garment after the revamp of the electoral system, while the party retained a total of 4 seats in the parliament. On 10 May 2022, the party elected Tommy Cheung as the new leader as the position is, per custom, occupied by a LegCo member. The Liberal Party leadership also supported John Lee during his campaign as the Chief Executive and after his election victory. Cheung stayed as a member of the Executive Council.

On 10 August 2022, three honorary chairpersons, James Tien, Miriam Lau, and Selina Chow, who supported non-establishment candidate in the last year&#x27;s election, decided to resign and quit the party to protest after the Central Committee discussed removing the titles without consulting them. Tien said the leadership did not follow the party&#x27;s traditions, while Chow expressed disappointment as the decision was not sound. Angered by the &quot;disrespect&quot; from the leadership, Chow attacked Shiu, the chairman, for &quot;dictating&quot; party reform. The Central Committee agreed the abolition unanimously later that day, and thank their contributions in a statement. The shake-up of the party leadership marked the end of the Tien era, whose moderate faction started to lose power after Carrie Lam became leader and the defeat of Chung.

<text>The first USS &quot;Dixie&quot; (later AD-1) was a United States Navy auxiliary cruiser and later a destroyer tender. The &quot;Dixie&quot; was the first ship of the United States Navy to have this name.

She was built as the steam brig El Rio in 1893 by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., Newport News, Virginia for the Southern Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Morgan Line. &quot;El Rio&quot; was purchased by the Navy 15 April 1898, converted to an auxiliary cruiser by her builder, and commissioned 19 April 1898, Commander Charles Henry Davis, Jr. in command.

==Service history==

===Spanish–American War, 1898–99===
&quot;Dixie&quot; stood out of Hampton Roads, 11 June 1898, and arrived at Santiago de Cuba on 19 June. Attached to Eastern Squadron, North Atlantic Fleet, she cruised in the West Indies during the Spanish–American War on blockade duty and convoying Army transports. During 27 and 28 July, she participated in the capture of Ponce, Puerto Rico, landing an armed force which received the surrender of the towns of Ponce and La Playa. She sailed from Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, 24 August and arrived at Philadelphia 22 September, where she was placed out of commission 7 March 1899. Between 15 March and 15 July she was on loan to the War Department for use as a transport.

===Training ship, 1899–1902===
Recommissioned 15 November 1899, &quot;Dixie&quot; began service as a training ship for recruits. From 17 December 1899 to 8 August 1900, she sailed to the West Indies, the Mediterranean, through the Suez Canal to the Philippines, where she transferred men to the base at Cavite, returning to the United States by the same route. Another training cruise was made from 29 September 1900 to 28 February 1901, during which she visited the Azores, Madeira, Gibraltar, and Mediterranean ports returning by way of the West Indies and La Guaira, Venezuela, to Norfolk. She transferred men and stores to the South Atlantic Station between 7 May and 3 July 1901, then made another training cruise to northern European waters and the Mediterranean between 24 July 1901 and 7 May 1902. From 14 May to 6 June 1902 she was on special duty, transporting provisions and supplies for the relief of victims of the volcanic eruptions of La Soufrière, St. Vincent and Mount Pelée, Martinique in the West Indies. She went out of commission at New York Navy Yard on 21 July 1902.

===Caribbean Squadron, 1903–1907===
&quot;Dixie&quot; was recommissioned 1 October 1903 and joined the Caribbean Squadron, North Atlantic Fleet. She served principally as a transport on the east coast, in the Caribbean, and the Panama Canal Zone, carrying Marines, recruits for training, and drafts of men for other vessels as well as engaging in target practice for her crew and Reserves. Assigned to the Special Service Squadron she steamed from Philadelphia 26 June 1905 to carry a party of scientists to the Mediterranean to observe the solar eclipse of 30 August. She arrived at Bône, Algeria, 21 July, and established Eclipse Station No. 2 for these observations. Returning to Philadelphia 13 October, she was returned to a noncommissioned status 10 days later. In commission again from 2 June 1906 to 1 November 1907, she transported Marines and stores to the Caribbean and cruised in that area to protect American interests.

===Destroyer Tender, 1909–1922===

She remained out of commission until 2 February 1909 when she was assigned as tender to Atlantic Torpedo Flotilla and Destroyer Squadron, Atlantic Fleet. She cruised on the east coast, in the Caribbean, and in the Gulf of Mexico in this service. In addition to her tender duty, she towed submarines; transported Marines and crews for other ships; carried the Nicaraguan expeditionary force to Colón, C.Z., and took part in the operations off Mexico during April and May 1914, transporting supplies and refugees from 1914 to 1915. She returned to Philadelphia 16 December 1915.

From 18 June 1916 to 6 May 1917, &quot;Dixie&quot; served as tender for Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet; engaged in gunnery exercises with destroyers and maneuvers with the fleet; delivered stores and mail; transported refugees from Mexico to Galveston, Texas, and served as tender to Squadron 4, Patrol Force, at Key West.

With American entry into World War I, &quot;Dixie&quot; departed Philadelphia 31 May 1917 to join U.S. naval forces operating in European waters. Arriving at Queenstown, Ireland, 12 June, she served as tender for American destroyers based at that port until 15 December 1918, except for a period of similar duty at Berehaven (21 June – 27 August 1917). Returning to Philadelphia 22 February 1919, &quot;Dixie&quot; served as tender to destroyer flotillas operating on the east coast, and in the Caribbean. On 24 February 1919, &quot;Dixie&quot; ran aground shortly after putting out of Kingston, Jamaica. She was pulled free by , and was able to continue on with the destroyer force to Guantánamo Bay.

Classified AD-1 on 17 July 1920 she arrived at Philadelphia 16 July to tend the destroyers in reserve at Philadelphia Navy Yard. From 6 April 1921 to 17 May 1922 she was again tender to Destroyer Squadrons Atlantic Fleet, cruising along the east coast from New York to Charleston, South Carolina. &quot;Dixie&quot; was decommissioned 30 June 1922 and sold 25 September of the same year.

<text>A renewable resource (also known as a flow resource) is a natural resource which will replenish to replace the portion depleted by usage and consumption, either through natural reproduction or other recurring processes in a finite amount of time in a human time scale. When the recovery rate of resources is unlikely to ever exceed a human time scale, these are called perpetual resources. Renewable resources are a part of Earth&#x27;s natural environment and the largest components of its ecosphere. A positive life-cycle assessment is a key indicator of a resource&#x27;s sustainability.

Definitions of renewable resources may also include agricultural production, as in agricultural products and to an extent water resources. In 1962, Paul Alfred Weiss defined renewable resources as: &quot;The total range of living organisms providing man with life, fibres, etc...&quot;. Another type of renewable resources is renewable energy resources. Common sources of renewable energy include solar, geothermal and wind power, which are all categorized as renewable resources. Fresh water is an example of a renewable resource.

==Air, food and water==
===Water resources===
Water can be considered a &quot;renewable&quot; material when carefully controlled usage and temperature, treatment, and release are followed. If not, it would become a non-renewable resource at that location. For example, as groundwater is usually removed from an aquifer at a rate much greater than its very slow natural recharge, it is a considered non-renewable resource. Removal of water from the pore spaces in aquifers may cause permanent compaction (subsidence) that cannot be renewed. 97.5% of the water on the Earth is salt water, and 3% is fresh water; slightly over two thirds of this is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps. The remaining unfrozen freshwater is found mainly as groundwater, with only a small fraction (0.008%) present above ground or in the air.

Water pollution is one of the main concerns regarding water resources. It is estimated that 22% of worldwide water is used in industry. Major industrial users include hydroelectric dams, thermoelectric power plants (which use water for cooling), ore and oil refineries (which use water in chemical processes) and manufacturing plants (which use water as a solvent), it is also used for dumping garbage.

Desalination of seawater is considered a renewable source of water, although reducing its dependence on fossil fuel energy is needed for it to be fully renewable.

===Non agricultural food===

Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. Most food has its origin in renewable resources. Food is obtained directly from plants and animals.

Hunting may not be the first source of meat in the modernised world, but it is still an important and essential source for many rural and remote groups. It is also the sole source of feeding for wild carnivores.

===Sustainable agriculture===

The phrase sustainable agriculture was coined by Australian agricultural scientist Gordon McClymont. It has been defined as &quot;an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a site-specific application that will last over the long term&quot;. Expansion of agricultural land reduces biodiversity and contributes to deforestation. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that in coming decades, cropland will continue to be lost to industrial and urban development, along with reclamation of wetlands, and conversion of forest to cultivation, resulting in the loss of biodiversity and increased soil erosion.
Although air and sunlight are available everywhere on Earth, crops also depend on soil nutrients and the availability of water. Monoculture is a method of growing only one crop at a time in a given field, which can damage land and cause it to become either unusable or suffer from reduced yields. Monoculture can also cause the build-up of pathogens and pests that target one specific species. The Great Irish Famine (1845–1849) is a well-known example of the dangers of monoculture.

Crop rotation and long-term crop rotations confer the replenishment of nitrogen through the use of green manure in sequence with cereals and other crops, and can improve soil structure and fertility by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants. Other methods to combat lost soil nutrients are returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands (returning lost nutrients indefinitely) such as the Flooding of the Nile, the long-term use of biochar, and use of crop and livestock landraces that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests, drought, or lack of nutrients.

Agricultural practices are one of the single greatest contributor to the global increase in soil erosion rates. It is estimated that &quot;more than a thousand million tonnes of southern Africa&#x27;s soil are eroded every year. Experts predict that crop yields will be halved within thirty to fifty years if erosion continues at present rates.&quot; The Dust Bowl phenomenon in the 1930s was caused by severe drought combined with farming methods that did not include crop rotation, fallow fields, cover crops, soil terracing and wind-breaking trees to prevent wind erosion.

The tillage of agricultural lands is one of the primary contributing factors to erosion, due to mechanised agricultural equipment that allows for deep plowing, which severely increases the amount of soil that is available for transport by water erosion.
The phenomenon called &quot;peak soil&quot; describes how large-scale factory farming techniques are affecting humanity&#x27;s ability to grow food in the future. Without efforts to improve soil management practices, the availability of arable soil may become increasingly problematic.

Methods to combat erosion include no-till farming, using a keyline design, growing wind breaks to hold the soil, and widespread use of compost. Fertilizers and pesticides can also have an effect of soil erosion, which can contribute to soil salinity and prevent other species from growing. Phosphate is a primary component in the chemical fertiliser applied most commonly in modern agricultural production. However, scientists estimate that rock phosphate reserves will be depleted in 50–100 years and that &quot;Peak Phosphate&quot; will occur in about 2030.

Industrial processing and logistics also have an effect on agriculture&#x27;s sustainability. The way and locations crops are sold requires energy for transportation, as well as the energy cost for materials, labour, and transport. Food sold at a local location, such a farmers&#x27; market, have reduced energy overheads.

===Air===
Air is a renewable resource. All living organisms need oxygen, nitrogen (directly or indirectly), carbon (directly or indirectly) and many other gases in small quantities for their survival.

==Non-food resources==
An important renewable resource is wood provided by means of forestry, which has been used for construction, housing and firewood since ancient times.
 Plants provide the main sources for renewable resources, the main distinction is between energy crops and non-food crops. A large variety of lubricants, industrially used vegetable oils, textiles and fibre made e.g. of cotton, copra or hemp, paper derived from wood, rags or grasses, bioplastic are based on plant renewable resources. A large variety of chemical based products like latex, ethanol, resin, sugar and starch can be provided with plant renewables. Animal based renewables include fur, leather, technical fat and lubricants and further derived products, as e.g. animal glue, tendons, casings or in historical times ambra and baleen provided by whaling.

With regard to pharmacy ingredients and legal and illegal drugs, plants are important sources, however e.g. venom of snakes, frogs and insects has been a valuable renewable source of pharmacological ingredients. Before GMO production set in, insulin and important hormones were based on animal sources. Feathers, an important byproduct of poultry farming for food, is still being used as filler and as base for keratin in general. Same applies for the chitin produced in farming Crustaceans which may be used as base of chitosan. The most important part of the human body used for non-medical purposes is human hair as for artificial hair integrations, which is being traded worldwide.

===Historical role===

Historically, renewable resources like firewood, latex, guano, charcoal, wood ash, plant colors as indigo, and whale products have been crucial for human needs but failed to supply demand in the beginning of the industrial era. Early modern times faced large problems with overuse of renewable resources as in deforestation, overgrazing or overfishing.

In addition to fresh meat and milk, which as food items are not the topic of this section, livestock farmers and artisans used further animal ingredients as tendons, horn, bones, bladders. Complex technical constructions as the composite bow were based on combination of animal and plant based materials. The current distribution conflict between biofuel and food production is being described as Food vs. fuel. Conflicts between food needs and usage, as supposed by fief obligations were in so far common in historical times as well. However, a significant percentage of (middle European) farmers yields went into livestock, which provides as well organic fertiliser. Oxen and horses were important for transportation purposes, drove engines as e.g. in treadmills.

Other regions solved the transportation problem with terracing, urban and garden agriculture. Further conflicts as between forestry and herding, or (sheep) herders and cattle farmers led to various solutions. Some confined wool production and sheep to large state and nobility domains or outsourced to professional shepherds with larger wandering herds.

The British Agricultural Revolution was mainly based on a new system of crop rotation, the four-field rotation. British agriculturist Charles Townshend recognised the invention in Dutch Waasland and popularised it in the 18th century UK, George Washington Carver in the USA. The system used wheat, turnips and barley and introduced as well clover. Clover is able to fix nitrogen from air, a practically non exhaustive renewable resource, into fertilizing compounds to the soil and allowed to increase yields by large. Farmers opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop. Thus livestock could to be bred year-round and winter culling was avoided. The amount of manure rose and allowed more crops but to refrain from wood pasture.

Early modern times and the 19th century saw the previous resource base partially replaced respectively supplemented by large scale chemical synthesis and by the use of fossil and mineral resources respectively. Besides the still central role of wood, there is a sort of renaissance of renewable products based on modern agriculture, genetic research and extraction technology. Besides fears about an upcoming global shortage of fossil fuels, local shortages due to boycotts, war and blockades or just transportation problems in remote regions have contributed to different methods of replacing or substituting fossil resources based on renewables.

===Challenges===
The use of certain basically renewable products as in TCM endangers various species. Just the black market in rhinoceros horn reduced the world&#x27;s rhino population by more than 90 percent over the past 40 years.

===Renewables used for self sufficiency===

The success of the German chemical industry till World War I was based on the replacement of colonial products. The predecessors of IG Farben dominated the world market for synthetic dyes at the beginning of the 20th century and had an important role in artificial pharmaceuticals, photographic film, agricultural chemicals and electrochemicals.

However the former Plant breeding research institutes took a different approach. After the loss of the German colonial empire, important players in the field as Erwin Baur and Konrad Meyer switched to using local crops as base for economic autarky. Meyer as a key agricultural scientist and spatial planner of the Nazi era managed and lead Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft resources and focused about a third of the complete research grants in Nazi Germany on agricultural and genetic research and especially on resources needed in case of a further German war effort. A wide array of agrarian research institutes still existing today and having importance in the field was founded or enlarged in the time.

There were some major failures as trying to e.g. grow frost resistant olive species, but some success in the case of hemp, flax, rapeseed, which are still of current importance. During World War 2, German scientists tried to use Russian Taraxacum (dandelion) species to manufacture natural rubber. Rubber dandelions are still of interest, as scientists in the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME) announced 2013 to have developed a cultivar that is suitable for commercial production of natural rubber.

==Legal situation and subsidies==
Several legal and economic means have been used to enhance the market share of renewables. 
The UK uses Non-Fossil Fuel Obligations (NFFO), a collection of orders requiring the electricity distribution network operators in England and Wales to purchase electricity from the nuclear power and renewable energy sectors. Similar mechanisms operate in Scotland (the Scottish Renewable Orders under the Scottish Renewables Obligation) and Northern Ireland (the Northern Ireland Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation). In the US, Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), use a similar approach. German Energiewende is using feed-in tariffs. An unexpected outcome of the subsidies was the quick increase of pellet byfiring in conventional fossil fuel plants (compare Tilbury power stations) and cement works, making wood respectively biomass accounting for about half of Europe&#x27;s renewable-energy consumption.

==Examples of industrial use==

===Biorenewable chemicals===
Biorenewable chemicals are chemicals created by biological organisms that provide feedstocks for the chemical industry. Biorenewable chemicals can provide solar-energy-powered substitutes for the petroleum-based carbon feedstocks that currently supply the chemical industry. The tremendous diversity of enzymes in biological organisms, and the potential for synthetic biology to alter these enzymes to create yet new chemical functionalities, can drive the chemical industry. A major platform for creation of new chemicals is the polyketide biosynthetic pathway, which generates chemicals containing repeated alkyl chain units with potential for a wide variety of functional groups at the different carbon atoms. Polyurethane research is ongoing that specifically uses renewable resources.

===Bioplastics===

Bioplastics are a form of plastics derived from renewable biomass sources, such as vegetable fats and oils, lignin, corn starch, pea starch or microbiota. The most common form of bioplastic is thermoplastic starch. Other forms include Cellulose bioplastics, biopolyester, Polylactic acid, and bio-derived polyethylene.

The production and use of bioplastics is generally regarded as a more sustainable activity when compared to plastic production from petroleum (petroplastic); however, manufacturing of bioplastic materials is often still reliant upon petroleum as an energy and materials source. Because of the fragmentation in the market and ambiguous definitions it is difficult to describe the total market size for bioplastics, but the global production capacity is estimated at 327,000 tonnes. In contrast, global consumption of all flexible packaging is estimated at 12.3 million tonnes.

===Bioasphalt===
Bioasphalt is an asphalt alternative made from non-petroleum based renewable resources. Manufacturing sources of bioasphalt include sugar, and rice, corn and potato starches, and vegetable oil based waste. Asphalt made with vegetable oil based binders was patented by Colas SA in France in 2004.

===Renewable energy===
Renewable energy refers to the provision of energy via renewable resources which are naturally replenished as fast as they are being used. Examples are sunlight, wind, biomass, rain, tides, waves and geothermal heat. Renewable energy may replace conventional fuels in four distinct markets, namely electricity generation, hot water/space heating, motor fuels, and rural (off-grid) energy services. Manufacturing of renewable energy devices uses non-renewable resources such as mined metals and land surface.

===Biomass===

Biomass is referring to biological material from living, or recently living organisms, most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials.

Sustainable harvesting and use of renewable resources (i.e., maintaining a positive renewal rate) can reduce air pollution, soil contamination, habitat destruction and land degradation. Biomass energy is derived from six distinct energy sources: garbage, wood, plants, waste, landfill gases, and alcohol fuels. Historically, humans have harnessed biomass-derived energy since the advent of burning wood to make fire, and wood remains the largest biomass energy source today.

However, low tech use of biomass, which still amounts for more than 10% of world energy needs may induce indoor air pollution in developing nations and results in between 1.5 million and 2 million deaths in 2000.

The biomass used for electricity generation varies by region. Forest by-products, such as wood residues, are common in the United States. Agricultural waste is common in Mauritius (sugar cane residue) and Southeast Asia (rice husks). Animal husbandry residues, such as poultry litter, are common in the UK. The biomass power generating industry in the United States, which consists of approximately 11,000 MW of summer operating capacity actively supplying power to the grid, produces about 1.4 percent of the U.S. electricity supply.

===Biofuel===


A biofuel is a type of fuel whose energy is derived from biological carbon fixation. Biofuels include fuels derived from biomass conversion, as well as solid biomass, liquid fuels and various biogases.

Bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermentation, mostly from carbohydrates produced in sugar or starch crops such as corn, sugarcane or switchgrass.

Biodiesel is made from vegetable oils and animal fats. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in Europe.

Biogas is methane produced by the process of anaerobic digestion of organic material by anaerobes., etc. is also a renewable source of energy.

===Biogas===

Biogas typically refers to a mixture of gases produced by the breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen. Biogas is produced by anaerobic digestion with anaerobic bacteria or fermentation of biodegradable materials such as manure, sewage, municipal waste, green waste, plant material, and crops. It is primarily methane () and carbon dioxide () and may have small amounts of hydrogen sulphide (), moisture and siloxanes.

===Natural fibre===
Natural fibres are a class of hair-like materials that are continuous filaments or are in discrete elongated pieces, similar to pieces of thread. They can be used as a component of composite materials. They can also be matted into sheets to make products such as paper or felt. Fibres are of two types: natural fibre which consists of animal and plant fibres, and man made fibre which consists of synthetic fibres and regenerated fibres.

==Threats to renewable resources==
Renewable resources are endangered by non-regulated industrial developments and growth. They must be carefully managed to avoid exceeding the natural world&#x27;s capacity to replenish them. A life cycle assessment provides a systematic means of evaluating renewability. This is a matter of sustainability in the natural environment.

===Overfishing===
&quot;National Geographic&quot; has described ocean over fishing as &quot;simply the taking of wildlife from the sea at rates too high for fished species to replace themselves.&quot;

Tuna meat is driving overfishing as to endanger some species like the bluefin tuna. The European Community and other organisations are trying to regulate fishery as to protect species and to prevent their extinctions. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea treaty deals with aspects of overfishing in articles 61, 62, and 65.

Examples of overfishing exist in areas such as the North Sea of Europe, the Grand Banks of North America and the East China Sea of Asia.

The decline of penguin population is caused in part by overfishing, caused by human competition over the same renewable resources

===Deforestation===

Besides their role as a resource for fuel and building material, trees protect the environment by absorbing carbon dioxide and by creating oxygen. The destruction of rain forests is one of the critical causes of climate change. Deforestation causes carbon dioxide to linger in the atmosphere. As carbon dioxide accrues, it produces a layer in the atmosphere that traps radiation from the sun. The radiation converts to heat which causes global warming, which is better known as the greenhouse effect.

Deforestation also affects the water cycle. It reduces the content of water in the soil and groundwater as well as atmospheric moisture. Deforestation reduces soil cohesion, so that erosion, flooding and landslides ensue.

Rain forests house many species and organisms providing people with food and other commodities. In this way biofuels may well be unsustainable if their production contributes to deforestation.

===Endangered species===
Some renewable resources, species and organisms are facing a very high risk of extinction caused by growing human population and over-consumption. It has been estimated that over 40% of all living species on Earth are at risk of going extinct. Many nations have laws to protect hunted species and to restrict the practice of hunting. Other conservation methods include restricting land development or creating preserves. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system. Internationally, 199 countries have signed an accord agreeing to create Biodiversity Action Plans to protect endangered and other threatened species.

<text>Strand is a municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. It is located in the traditional district of Ryfylke. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Jørpeland. The municipality lies across the fjord from the city of Stavanger. The Ryfast tunnel system connects Stavanger and Strand by a very long undersea tunnel.

The villages of Sørskår and Fiskå are located in northern Strand, on the southern shore of the Årdalsfjorden. This area of Strand produces fruit, vegetables, and dairy products. The Fiskå Mølle (Fiskå Mill) is located in Fiskå. The larger village of Tau is located on the western coast of Strand. It is a transportation hub with ferry connections to the city of Stavanger and bus services to nearby Hjelmelandsvågen and deeper into the Ryfylke district. About southeast of Tau is the municipal center of Jørpeland. This town is the largest settlement in Strand with about 7,000 people.

The municipality is the 278th largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Strand is the 90th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 13,474. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has increased by 13.4% over the previous 10-year period.

Holtaheia was the mountain behind Holta farm where 34 school boys, 2 teachers and 3 crew died, when the Cunard Viking flight &#x27;Papa Mike&#x27; crashed into the mountain, en route to Stavanger.

==General information==


The parish of Strand was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). In 1865, the large district of Høgsfjord (population: 3,203) was separated from Strand to form a new municipality, leaving a much smaller Strand municipality. This left Strand with 2,228 residents. On 1 January 1965, the Sørskår-Sundgardene area (population: 121) was transferred from the neighboring municipality of Årdal to Strand. On 1 January 2020, the northwestern part of Forsand municipality was transferred to Strand (while the rest of Forsand was merged with Sandnes).

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Strand&quot; farm () since the first Strand Church was built there. The name is identical to the word which means &quot;beach&quot;, &quot;shore&quot;, or &quot;border&quot;, likely due to its location along the fjord.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 25 May 1973. The official blazon is &quot;Argent, three water wheels gules, two over one&quot; (). This means the arms have a field (background) has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The charge is a set of three water wheels (two over one). The wheels are a symbol for the hydropower, which has been of importance to the municipality, first (since 1850) by using watermills to grind corn and grains, and now using modern hydro-electric plants. The arms were designed by Odd Fjordholm. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms. 

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has two parishes () within the municipality of Strand. It is part of the Ryfylke prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Stavanger.

==Geography==
Strand is located on the mainland of Norway, on the south side of the vast Boknafjorden. The small islands of Idse and Idsal are located in the southwest part of Strand, between the Høgsfjorden and Idsefjorden. The small islands of Heng and Sør-Hidle lie in the large fjord between Strand and Stavanger. The lakes Tysdalsvatnet, Bjørheimsvatnet, and Vostervatnet are all located in Strand. The municipality of Hjelmeland lies to the north and east and Sandnes is to the south. The archipelago containing the islands of Stavanger Municipality lie to the northwest.

==Government==
Strand Municipality is responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.

There are several festivals in Strand, including &quot;Ryfylke Ungdomsfestival&quot; (Ryfylke Youth Festival), Strandadagane (Strand Days) and &quot;Melting Pot&quot; (art seminar, mostly making decorative art out of scrap-iron). The annual race between Jørpeland and Tau, &quot;Strandamila&quot;, is an event which attracts hundreds of people. The race is along the highway, either by bike or on foot. Strand also has many sport facilities. There are a lot of football pitches spread around the municipality, as well as local fitness centres. Tau also has two tennis courts, a beach-volleyball field, and a basketball court, as well as &quot;Ryfylkehallen&quot;, the largest indoor football arena in the county of Rogaland.

Strand experienced a strong influx of newcomers from Stavanger and Jæren starting in the late 1970s. The original social fabric was divided into factory workers at the iron mill, farmers, and the strong Lutheran tradition. The divides were in many ways exclusive, and only limited movement between the social groups was seen. In later years these divides have become significantly weaker.

<text>In the United States, an executive order is a directive by the president of the United States that manages operations of the federal government, guiding agencies on how to interpret and implement congressionally-passed laws. The legal or constitutional basis for executive orders has multiple sources. The theory that Article Two of the United States Constitution gives presidents broad executive and enforcement authority to use their discretion to determine how to enforce the law or to otherwise manage the resources and staff of the federal government&#x27;s executive branch is a highly contested understanding with minimal foundation in any of the country&#x27;s founding documents. The ability to make such orders is also based on expressed or implied Acts of Congress that delegate to the president some degree of discretionary power (delegated legislation). The vast majority of executive orders are proposed by federal agencies before being issued by the president.

Like both legislative statutes and the regulations promulgated by government agencies, executive orders are subject to judicial review and may be overturned if the orders lack support by statute or the Constitution. Some policy initiatives require approval by the legislative branch, but executive orders have significant influence over the internal affairs of government, deciding how and to what degree legislation will be enforced, dealing with emergencies, waging wars, and in general fine-tuning policy choices in the implementation of broad statutes. As the head of state and head of government of the United States, as well as commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces, only the president of the United States can issue an executive order.

Presidential executive orders, once issued, remain in force until they are canceled, revoked, adjudicated unlawful, or expire on their terms. At any time, the president may revoke, modify or make exceptions from any executive order, whether the order was made by the current president or a predecessor. Typically, a new president reviews in-force executive orders in the first few weeks in office.

== Basis in the United States Constitution ==
The United States Constitution does not have a provision that explicitly permits the use of executive orders. ArticleII, Section1, Clause1 of the Constitution simply states: &quot;The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.&quot; Sections2 and3 describe the various powers and duties of the president, including &quot;He shall take care that the Laws be faithfully executed&quot;.

The U.S. Supreme Court has held that all executive orders from the president of the United States must be supported by the Constitution, whether from a clause granting specific power, or by Congress delegating such to the executive branch. Specifically, such orders must be rooted in Article II of the US Constitution or enacted by the Congress in statutes. Attempts to block such orders have been successful at times, when such orders either exceeded the authority of the president or could be better handled through legislation.

The Office of the Federal Register is responsible for assigning the executive order a sequential number, after receipt of the signed original from the White House and printing the text of the executive order in the daily &quot;Federal Register&quot; and eventually in Title3 of the &quot;Code of Federal Regulations&quot;.

== History and use ==
With the exception of William Henry Harrison, all presidents since George Washington in 1789 have issued orders that in general terms can be described as executive orders. Initially, they took no set form and so they varied as to form and substance.

The first executive order was issued by Washington on June 8, 1789; addressed to the heads of the federal departments, it instructed them &quot;to impress [him] with a full, precise, and distinct general idea of the affairs of the United States&quot; in their fields.

According to political scientist Brian R. Dirck, the most famous executive order was by President Abraham Lincoln when he issued the Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, 1862, which in part contained explicit directions to the Army, the Navy, and other Executive departments:

Until the early 1900s, executive orders were mostly unannounced and undocumented, and seen only by the agencies to which they were directed.

That changed when the US Department of State instituted a numbering scheme in 1907, starting retroactively with United States Executive Order 1, issued on October 20, 1862, by President Lincoln. The documents that later came to be known as &quot;executive orders&quot; apparently gained their name from that order issued by Lincoln, which was captioned &quot;Executive Order Establishing a Provisional Court in Louisiana&quot;. That court functioned during the military occupation of Louisiana during the American Civil War, and Lincoln also used Executive Order1 to appoint Charles A. Peabody as judge and designate the salaries of the court&#x27;s officers.

President Harry Truman&#x27;s Executive Order 10340 placed all the country&#x27;s steel mills under federal control, which was found invalid in &quot;Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer&quot;, 343 US 579 (1952), because it attempted to make law, rather than to clarify or to further a law put forth by the Congress or the Constitution. Presidents since that decision have generally been careful to cite the specific laws under which they act when they issue new executive orders; likewise, when presidents believe that their authority for issuing an executive order stems from within the powers outlined in the Constitution, the order instead simply proclaims &quot;under the authority vested in me by the Constitution&quot;.

Wars have been fought upon executive order, including the 1999 Kosovo War during President Bill Clinton&#x27;s second term in office; however, all such wars have also had authorizing resolutions from Congress. The extent to which the president may exercise military power independently of Congress and the scope of the War Powers Resolution remain unresolved constitutional issues, but all presidents since the passage of the resolution have complied with its terms, while also maintaining that they are not constitutionally required to do so.

Harry S. Truman issued 907 executive orders, with 1,081 orders made by Theodore Roosevelt, 1,203 orders made by Calvin Coolidge, and 1,803 orders made by Woodrow Wilson. Franklin D. Roosevelt has the distinction of making a record 3,721 executive orders.

In 2021, President Joe Biden issued 42 executive orders in the first 100 days of his presidency, more than any other president since Harry Truman. However, in early 2025, Donald Trump surpassed his number by issuing 63 executive orders in his first 22 days in office. As of February 9, 2025, Trump is the president to issue the second-most executive orders in his first 100 days, behind only Franklin Roosevelt (who issued 99 executive orders in his first 100 days).

=== Franklin Roosevelt ===
Before 1932, uncontested executive orders had determined such issues as national mourning on the death of a president and the lowering of flags to half-staff.

President Franklin Roosevelt issued the first of his 3,721 executive orders on March 6, 1933, declaring a bank holiday, and forbidding banks to release gold coin or bullion. Executive Order 6102 forbade the hoarding of gold coin, bullion and gold certificates. A further executive order required all newly mined domestic gold be delivered to the Treasury.

By Executive Order 6581, the president created the Export-Import Bank of the United States. On March 7, 1934, he established the National Recovery Review Board (Executive Order 6632). On June 29, the president issued Executive Order 6763 &quot;under the authority vested in me by the Constitution&quot;, thereby creating the National Labor Relations Board.

In 1934, while Charles Evans Hughes was Chief Justice of the United States (the period being known as the Hughes Court), the Court found that the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) was unconstitutional. The president then issued Executive Order 7073 &quot;by virtue of the authority vested in me under the said Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935&quot;, re-establishing the National Emergency Council to administer the functions of the NIRA in carrying out the provisions of the Emergency Relief Appropriations Act. On June 15, he issued Executive Order 7075, which terminated the NIRA and replaced it with the Office of Administration of the National Recovery Administration.

In the years that followed, Roosevelt replaced outgoing justices of the Supreme Court with people more in line with his views: Hugo Black, Stanley Reed, Felix Frankfurter, William O. Douglas, Frank Murphy, Robert H. Jackson and James F. Byrnes. Historically, only George Washington has had equal or greater influence over Supreme Court appointments (as he chose all its original members).

Justices Frankfurter, Douglas, Black, and Jackson dramatically checked presidential power by invalidating the executive order at issue in &quot;Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer&quot;: in that case Roosevelt&#x27;s successor, Harry S. Truman, had ordered private steel production facilities seized in Executive Order 10340 to support the Korean War effort: the Court held that the executive order was not within the power granted to the president by the Constitution.

== Reaction ==
Large policy changes with wide-ranging effects have been implemented by executive order, including the racial integration of the armed forces under President Truman.

Two extreme examples of an executive order are Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s Executive Order 6102 &quot;forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States&quot;, and Executive Order 9066, which delegated military authority to remove any or all people in a military zone (used to target Japanese Americans, non-citizen Germans, and non-citizen Italians in certain regions). The order was then delegated to General John L. DeWitt, and it subsequently paved the way for all Japanese-Americans on the West Coast to be incarcerated in ten specially built prison camps the duration of World War II.

President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13233 in 2001, which restricted public access to the papers of former presidents. The order was criticized by the Society of American Archivists and other groups, who say it &quot;violates both the spirit and letter of existing U.S. law on access to presidential papers as clearly laid down in 44 USC 2201–07&quot;, and adding that the order &quot;potentially threatens to undermine one of the very foundations of our nation&quot;. President Barack Obama subsequently revoked Executive Order 13233 in January 2009.

The Heritage Foundation has accused presidents of abusing executive orders by using them to make laws without congressional approval and moving existing laws away from their original mandates.

=== Legal conflicts ===
In 1935, the Supreme Court overturned five of Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s executive orders (6199, 6204, 6256, 6284a and 6855).

, issued by President Bill Clinton in 1995, attempted to prevent the federal government from contracting with organizations that had strike-breakers on the payroll: a federal appeals court ruled that the order conflicted with the National Labor Relations Act and overturned the order.

Congress has the power to overturn an executive order by passing legislation that invalidates it, and can also refuse to provide funding necessary to carry out certain policy measures contained with the order or legitimize policy mechanisms.

In the case of the former, the president retains the power to veto such a decision; however, Congress may override a veto with a two-thirds majority to end an executive order. It has been argued that a congressional override of an executive order is a nearly impossible event, because of the supermajority vote required, and the fact that such a vote leaves individual lawmakers vulnerable to political criticism.

On July 30, 2014, the US House of Representatives approved a resolution authorizing Speaker of the House John Boehner to sue President Obama over claims that he exceeded his executive authority in changing a key provision of the Affordable Care Act (&quot;Obamacare&quot;) on his own and over what Republicans claimed had been &quot;inadequate enforcement of the health care law&quot;, which Republican lawmakers opposed. In particular, Republicans &quot;objected that the Obama administration delayed some parts of the law, particularly the mandate on employers who do not provide health care coverage&quot;. The suit was filed in the US District Court for the District of Columbia on November 21, 2014.

Part of President Donald Trump&#x27;s executive order Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States, which temporarily banned entry to the US of citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, including for permanent residents, was stayed by a federal court on January 28, 2017. However, on June 26, 2018, the US Supreme Court overturned the lower court order in &quot;Trump v. Hawaii&quot; and affirmed that the executive order was within the president&#x27;s constitutional authority.

The degree to which the president has the power to use executive orders to set policy for independent federal agencies is disputed. Many orders specifically exempt independent agencies, but some do not. Executive Order 12866 has been a particular matter of controversy; it requires cost-benefit analysis for certain regulatory actions.

== State executive orders ==

Executive orders issued by state governors are not the same as statutes passed by state legislatures. State executive orders are usually based on existing constitutional or statutory powers of the governor and do not require any action by the state legislature to take effect.&lt;ref name= &quot;https://www.colorado.governor/executive-orders&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;https://gov.georgia.gov/executive-orders&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;https://www.governor.wa.gov/office-governor/official-actions/executive-orders&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;https://www.flgov.com/all-executive-orders&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;https://rules.utah.gov/executive-documents&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive orders may, for example, demand budget cuts from state government when the state legislature is not in session, and economic conditions take a downturn, thereby decreasing tax revenue below what was forecast when the budget was approved. Depending on the state constitution, a governor may specify by what percentage each government agency must reduce and may exempt those that are already particularly underfunded or cannot put long-term expenses (such as capital expenditures) off until a later fiscal year. The governor may also call the legislature into special session.

There are also other uses for gubernatorial executive orders. In 2007, for example, Sonny Perdue, the governor of Georgia, issued an executive order for all its state agencies to reduce water use during a major drought. The same was demanded of its counties&#x27; water systems as well, but it was unclear whether the order would have the force of law.

== Presidential proclamation ==
According to political expert Phillip J. Cooper, a presidential proclamation &quot;states a condition, declares a law and requires obedience, recognizes an event or triggers the implementation of a law (by recognizing that the circumstances in law have been realized)&quot;. Presidents define situations or conditions on situations that become legal or economic truth. Such orders carry the same force of law as executive orders, the difference between being that executive orders are aimed at those inside government, but proclamations are aimed at those outside government.

The administrative weight of those proclamations is upheld because they are often specifically authorized by congressional statute, making them &quot;delegated unilateral powers&quot;. Presidential proclamations are often dismissed as a practical presidential tool for policy making because of the perception that proclamations are largely ceremonial or symbolic in nature. However, the legal weight of presidential proclamations suggests their importance to presidential governance.

<text>Audre Lorde ( ; born Audrey Geraldine Lorde; February 18, 1934–November 17, 1992) was an American writer, professor, philosopher, intersectional feminist, poet and civil rights activist. She was a self-described &quot;Black, lesbian, feminist, socialist, mother, warrior, poet&quot; who dedicated her life and talents to confronting different forms of injustice, as she believed there could be &quot;no hierarchy of oppressions&quot; among &quot;those who share the goals of liberation and a workable future for our children.&quot;

As a poet, she is well known for technical mastery and emotional expression, as well as her poems that express anger and outrage at civil and social injustices she observed throughout her life. She was the recipient of national and international awards and the founding member of &quot;Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press&quot;. As a spoken word artist, her delivery has been called powerful, melodic, and intense by the Poetry Foundation. Her poems and prose largely deal with issues related to civil rights, feminism, lesbianism, illness, disability, and the exploration of Black female identity.

==Early life==
Audre Lorde was born on February 18, 1934, in New York City to Caribbean immigrants Frederick Byron Lorde and Linda Gertrude Belmar Lorde. Her father, Frederick Byron Lorde (Byron), was born on April 20, 1898 in Barbados. Her mother, Linda Gertrude Belmar Lorde, was born in 1902 on the island Carriacou in Grenada. Lorde&#x27;s mother was of mixed ancestry but passed as Spanish, which was a source of pride for her family. Lorde&#x27;s father was darker than the Belmar family liked, and they only allowed the couple to marry because of Byron&#x27;s charm, ambition, and persistence. After their immigration, the new family settled in Harlem, a diverse neighborhood in upper Manhattan, New York. Lorde was the youngest of three daughters, her older sisters named Phyllis and Helen Lorde. Lorde was nearsighted to the point of being legally blind, so she grew up listening to her mother&#x27;s stories about the West Indies rather than reading them. At the age of four, she learned to talk while she learned to read, and her mother taught her to write at around the same time. She wrote her first poem when she was in eighth grade.

Born as Audrey Geraldine Lorde, she chose to drop the &quot;y&quot; from her first name while still a child, explaining in &quot;&quot; that she was more interested in the artistic symmetry of the &quot;e&quot;-endings in the two side-by-side names &quot;Audre Lorde&quot; than in spelling her name the way her parents had intended.

Lorde&#x27;s relationship with her parents was difficult from a young age. She spent very little time with her father and mother, who were both busy maintaining their real estate business in the tumultuous economy after the Great Depression. When she did see them, they were often cold or emotionally distant. In particular, Lorde&#x27;s relationship with her mother, who was deeply suspicious of people with darker skin than hers (which Lorde had) and the outside world in general, was characterized by &quot;tough love&quot; and strict adherence to family rules. Lorde&#x27;s difficult relationship with her mother figured prominently in her later poems, such as &quot;Coal&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Story Books on a Kitchen Table.&quot;

As a child, Lorde struggled with communication, and came to appreciate the power of poetry as a form of expression. She even described herself as thinking in poetry. She memorized a great deal of poetry, and would use it to communicate, to the extent that, &quot;If asked how she was feeling, Audre would reply by reciting a poem.&quot; Around the age of twelve, she began writing her own poetry and connecting with others at her school who were considered &quot;outcasts&quot;, as she felt she was.

Raised Catholic, Lorde attended parochial schools before moving on to Hunter College High School, a secondary school for intellectually gifted students. Poet Diane di Prima was a classmate and friend. While attending Hunter, Lorde published her first poem in &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine after her school&#x27;s literary journal rejected it for being inappropriate. Also in high school, Lorde participated in poetry workshops sponsored by the Harlem Writers Guild, but noted that she always felt like somewhat of an outcast from the Guild. She felt she was not accepted because she &quot;was both crazy and queer but [they thought] I would grow out of it all.&quot; Lorde graduated from Hunter College High School in 1951.

&quot;Zami&quot; places her father&#x27;s death from a stroke around New Year&#x27;s 1953.

==Career==

In 1954, she spent a pivotal year as a student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, a period she described as a time of affirmation and renewal. During this time, she confirmed her identity on personal and artistic levels as both a lesbian and a poet. On her return to New York, Lorde attended Hunter College, and graduated in the class of 1959. While there, she worked as a librarian, continued writing, and became an active participant in the gay culture of Greenwich Village. She furthered her education at Columbia University, earning a master&#x27;s degree in library science in 1961. During this period, she worked as a public librarian in nearby Mount Vernon, New York.

In 1968 Lorde was writer-in-residence at Tougaloo College in Mississippi.
Lorde&#x27;s time at Tougaloo College, like her year at the National University of Mexico, was a formative experience for her as an artist. She led workshops with her young, black undergraduate students, many of whom were eager to discuss the civil rights issues of that time. Through her interactions with her students, she reaffirmed her desire not only to live out her &quot;crazy and queer&quot; identity, but also to devote attention to the formal aspects of her craft as a poet. Her book of poems, &quot;Cables to Rage,&quot; came out of her time and experiences at Tougaloo.

From 1972 to 1987, Lorde resided on Staten Island. During that time, in addition to writing and teaching she co-founded Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press.

In 1977, Lorde became an associate of the Women&#x27;s Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.

Lorde taught in the Education Department at Lehman College from 1969 to 1970, then as a professor of English at John Jay College of Criminal Justice (both part of the City University of New York, CUNY) from 1970 to 1981. There, she fought for the creation of a black studies department. In 1981, she went on to teach at her alma mater, Hunter College (also CUNY), as the distinguished Thomas Hunter chair. As a queer Black woman, she was an outsider in a white-male dominated field and her experiences in this environment deeply influenced her work. New fields such as African American studies and women&#x27;s studies advanced the topics that scholars were addressing and garnered attention to groups that had previously been rarely discussed. With this newfound academic environment, Lorde was inspired to not only write poetry but also essays and articles about queer, feminist, and African American studies.

In 1980, together with Barbara Smith and Cherríe Moraga, she co-founded Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press, the first U.S. publisher for women of color.

In 1981, Lorde was among the founders of the Women&#x27;s Coalition of St. Croix, an organization dedicated to assisting women who have survived sexual abuse and intimate partner violence. In the late 1980s, she also helped establish Sisterhood in Support of Sisters (SISA) in South Africa to benefit black women who were affected by apartheid and other forms of injustice.

In 1985, Audre Lorde was a part of a delegation of black women writers who had been invited to Cuba. The trip was sponsored by &quot;The Black Scholar&quot; and the Union of Cuban Writers. She embraced the shared sisterhood as black women writers. They visited Cuban poets Nancy Morejon and Nicolas Guillen. They discussed whether the Cuban revolution had truly changed racism and the status of lesbians and gays there.

=== The Berlin years ===

In 1984, Lorde started a visiting professorship in West Berlin at the Free University of Berlin. She was invited by FU lecturer Dagmar Schultz who had met her at the UN &quot;World Women&#x27;s Conference&quot; in Copenhagen in 1980. During her time in Germany, Lorde became an influential part of the then-nascent Afro-German movement. Together with a group of black women activists in Berlin, Audre Lorde coined the term &quot;Afro-German&quot; in 1984 and, consequently, gave rise to the Black movement in Germany. During her many trips to Germany, Lorde became a mentor to a number of women, including May Ayim, Ika Hügel-Marshall, and Helga Emde. Instead of fighting systemic issues through violence, Lorde thought that language was a powerful form of resistance and encouraged the women of Germany to speak up instead of fight back. Her impact on Germany reached more than just Afro-German women; Lorde helped increase awareness of intersectionality across racial and ethnic lines. Audre Lorde provided a safe space for these Black German women to process and handle their emotions in any way that they seemed fit. To be othered by mainstream German society, and to be defined through others perceptions of your apparent “faults” (mixed heritage) can destroy one&#x27;s sense of self. Alongside the fact that many of these women weren&#x27;t able to fully express all facets of their being and were constantly pigeonholed into the place society decides to commit them to was immensely restrictive. Audre Lorde was able to begin to bridge the gap between these women&#x27;s perceived identity by the German public and their self actualized being. Lorde created a space for which these women could discuss their experiences and grow a Black German epistemology. This is not to say that Lorde single handedly started this identification of a pro Black German identity but more so that she offered these German women a model for kinship, self-naming, and intellectual activism.

In December 1989, the month after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Lorde wrote her poem &quot;East Berlin 1989&quot; conveying her views of this historic event. In the poem, while Lorde voices her alarm about increased violent racism against Afro-Germans and other Black people in Berlin due to the new free movement of East Germans, she also more broadly and fundamentally decries the triumph of capitalist democratic freedoms and Western influences, demonstrating her deep skepticism about, and resistance to, the &quot;Peaceful Revolution&quot; that would lead to the transition of Communist East Germany to parliamentary liberal democracy, market capitalism, and ultimately German reunification.

Lorde&#x27;s impact on the Afro-German movement was the focus of the 2012 documentary by Dagmar Schultz. &quot;Audre Lorde: The Berlin Years 1984–1992&quot; was accepted by the Berlin Film Festival, Berlinale, and had its World Premiere at the 62nd Annual Festival in 2012. The film has gone on to film festivals around the world, and continued to be viewed at festivals until 2018. The documentary has received seven awards, including Winner of the Best Documentary Audience Award 2014 at the 15th Reelout Queer Film + Video Festival, the Gold Award for Best Documentary at the International Film Festival for Women, Social Issues, and Zero Discrimination, and the Audience Award for Best Documentary at the Barcelona International LGBT Film Festival. &quot;Audre Lorde: The Berlin Years&quot; revealed the previous lack of recognition that Lorde received for her contributions towards the theories of intersectionality.

Lorde was State Poet of New York from 1991 to 1992.

==Poetry==
Lorde focused her discussion of difference not only on differences between groups of women but between conflicting differences within the individual. &quot;I am defined as other in every group I&#x27;m part of,&quot; she declared. &quot;Yet without community,&quot; Lorde wrote, &quot;there is certainly no liberation, no future, only the most vulnerable and temporary armistice between me and my oppression&quot;. She described herself both as a part of a &quot;continuum of women&quot; and a &quot;concert of voices&quot; within herself.

Her conception of her many layers of selfhood is replicated in the multi-genres of her work. Critic Carmen Birkle wrote: &quot;Her multicultural self is thus reflected in a multicultural text, in multi-genres, in which the individual cultures are no longer separate and autonomous entities but melt into a larger whole without losing their individual importance.&quot; Her refusal to be placed in a particular category, whether social or literary, was characteristic of her determination to come across as an individual rather than a stereotype. Lorde considered herself a &quot;lesbian, mother, warrior, poet&quot; and used poetry to get this message across.

===Early works===

Lorde&#x27;s poetry was published very regularly during the 1960s – in Langston Hughes&#x27; 1962 &quot;&quot;; in several foreign anthologies; and in black literary magazines. During this time, she was also politically active in civil rights, anti-war, and feminist movements.

In 1968, Lorde published &quot;The First Cities&quot;, her first volume of poems. It was edited by Diane di Prima, a former classmate and friend from Hunter College High School. &quot;The First Cities&quot; has been described as a &quot;quiet, introspective book&quot;, and Dudley Randall, a poet and critic, asserted in his review of the book that Lorde &quot;does not wave a black flag, but her Blackness is there, implicit, in the bone&quot;.

Her second volume, &quot;Cables to Rage&quot; (1970), which was mainly written during her tenure as poet-in-residence at Tougaloo College in Mississippi, addressed themes of love, betrayal, childbirth, and the complexities of raising children. It is particularly noteworthy for the poem &quot;Martha&quot;, in which Lorde openly confirms her homosexuality for the first time in her writing: &quot;[W]e shall love each other here if ever at all.&quot;

Nominated for the National Book Award for poetry in 1974, &quot;From a Land Where Other People Live&quot; (Broadside Press) shows Lorde&#x27;s personal struggles with identity and anger at social injustice. The volume deals with themes of anger, loneliness, and injustice, as well as what it means to be a black woman, mother, friend, and lover.

1974 saw the release of &quot;New York Head Shop and Museum&quot;, which gives a picture of Lorde&#x27;s New York through the lenses of both the civil rights movement and her own restricted childhood: stricken with poverty and neglect and, in Lorde&#x27;s opinion, in need of political action.

===Wider recognition===

Despite the success of these volumes, it was the release of &quot;Coal&quot; in 1976 that established Lorde as an influential voice in the Black Arts Movement, and the large publishing house behind it – Norton – helped introduce her to a wider audience. The volume includes poems from both &quot;The First Cities&quot; and &quot;Cables to Rage&quot;, and it unites many of the themes Lorde would become known for throughout her career: her rage at racial injustice, her celebration of her black identity, and her call for an intersectional consideration of women&#x27;s experiences. Lorde followed &quot;Coal&quot; up with &quot;Between Our Selves&quot; (also in 1976) and &quot;Hanging Fire&quot; (1978).

In Lorde&#x27;s volume &quot;The Black Unicorn&quot; (1978), she describes her identity within the mythos of African female deities of creation, fertility, and warrior strength. This reclamation of African female identity both builds and challenges existing Black Arts ideas about pan-Africanism. While writers like Amiri Baraka and Ishmael Reed utilized African cosmology in a way that &quot;furnished a repertoire of bold male gods capable of forging and defending an aboriginal Black universe,&quot; in Lorde&#x27;s writing &quot;that warrior ethos is transferred to a female vanguard capable equally of force and fertility.&quot;

Lorde&#x27;s poetry became more open and personal as she grew older and became more confident in her sexuality. In &quot;Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches&quot;, Lorde states, &quot;Poetry is the way we help give name to the nameless so it can be thought... As they become known to and accepted by us, our feelings and the honest exploration of them become sanctuaries and spawning grounds for the most radical and daring ideas.&quot; &quot;Sister Outsider&quot; also elaborates Lorde&#x27;s challenge to European-American traditions.

==Prose==
&quot;The Cancer Journals&quot; (1980) and &quot;A Burst of Light&quot; (1988) both use non-fiction prose, including essays and journal entries, to bear witness to, explore, and reflect on Lorde&#x27;s diagnosis, treatment, recovery from breast cancer, and ultimately fatal recurrence with liver metastases. In both works, Lorde deals with Western notions of illness, disability, treatment, cancer and sexuality, and physical beauty and prosthesis, as well as themes of death, fear of mortality, survival, emotional healing, and inner power.

Lorde&#x27;s deeply personal book &quot;&quot; (1982), subtitled a &quot;biomythography&quot;, chronicles her childhood and adulthood. The narrative deals with the evolution of Lorde&#x27;s sexuality and self-awareness.

=== &quot;Sister Outsider&quot; ===
In &quot;Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches&quot; (1984), Lorde asserts the necessity of communicating the experience of marginalized groups to make their struggles visible in a repressive society. She emphasizes the need for different groups of people (particularly white women and African-American women) to find common ground in their lived experience, but also to face difference directly, and use it as a source of strength rather than alienation. She repeatedly emphasizes the need for community in the struggle to build a better world. How to constructively channel the anger and rage incited by oppression is another prominent theme throughout her works, and in this collection in particular.

Her most famous essay, &quot;The Master&#x27;s Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master&#x27;s House&quot;, is included in &quot;Sister Outsider&quot;. Lorde questions the scope and ability for change to be instigated when examining problems through a racist, patriarchal lens. She insists that women see differences between other women not as something to be tolerated, but something that is necessary to generate power and to actively &quot;be&quot; in the world. This will create a community that embraces differences, which will ultimately lead to liberation. Lorde elucidates, &quot;Divide and conquer, in our world, must become define and empower.&quot; Also, people must educate themselves about the oppression of others because expecting a marginalized group to educate the oppressors is the continuation of racist, patriarchal thought. She explains that this is a major tool utilized by oppressors to keep the oppressed occupied with the master&#x27;s concerns. She concludes that to bring about real change, we cannot work within the racist, patriarchal framework because change brought about in that will not remain.

Also in &quot;Sister Outsider&quot; is the essay, &quot;The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action&quot;. Lorde discusses the importance of speaking, even when afraid, because otherwise silence immobilizes and chokes us. Many people fear to speak the truth because of the real risks of retaliation, but Lorde warns, &quot;Your silence does not protect you.&quot; Lorde emphasizes that &quot;the transformation of silence into language and action is a self-revelation, and that always seems fraught with danger.&quot; People are afraid of others&#x27; reactions for speaking, but mostly for demanding visibility, which is essential to live. Lorde adds, &quot;We can sit in our corners mute forever while our sisters and ourselves are wasted, while our children are distorted and destroyed, while our earth is poisoned; we can sit in our safe corners mute as bottles, and we will still be no less afraid.&quot; &quot;People are taught to respect their fear of speaking more than silence, but ultimately, the silence will choke us anyway, so we might as well speak the truth.&quot; Lorde writes that we can learn to speak even when we are afraid.

In &quot;Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference&quot;, Lorde emphasizes the importance of educating others. However, she stresses that in order to educate others, one must first be educated. Empowering people who are doing the work does not mean using privilege to overstep and overpower such groups; but rather, privilege must be used to hold door open for other allies. Lorde describes the inherent problems within society by saying, &quot;racism, the belief in the inherent superiority of one race over all others and thereby the right to dominance. Sexism, the belief in the inherent superiority of one sex over the other and thereby the right to dominance. Ageism. Heterosexism. Elitism. Classism.&quot; Lorde finds herself among some of these &quot;deviant&quot; groups in society, which set the tone for the status quo and what &quot;not to be&quot; in society. Lorde argues that women feel pressure to conform to their &quot;oneness&quot; before recognizing the separation among them due to their &quot;manyness&quot;, or aspects of their identity. She stresses that this behavior is exactly what &quot;explains feminists&#x27; inability to forge the kind of alliances necessary to create a better world.&quot;

In relation to non-intersectional feminism in the United States, Lorde famously said:
==Film==
Lorde had several films that highlighted her journey as an activist in the 1980s and 1990s.

&quot;The Berlin Years: 1984–1992&quot; documented Lorde&#x27;s time in Germany as she led Afro-Germans in a movement that would allow black people to establish identities for themselves outside of stereotypes and discrimination. After a long history of systemic racism in Germany, Lorde introduced a new sense of empowerment for minorities. As seen in the film, she walks through the streets with pride despite stares and words of discouragement. Including moments like these in a documentary was important for people to see during that time. It inspired them to take charge of their identities and discover who they are outside of the labels put on them by society. The film also educates people on the history of racism in Germany. This enables viewers to understand how Germany reached this point in history and how the society developed. Through her promotion of the study of history and her example of taking her experiences in her stride, she influenced people of many different backgrounds.

The film documents Lorde&#x27;s efforts to empower and encourage women to start the Afro-German movement. What began as a few friends meeting in a friend&#x27;s home to get to know other black people, turned into what is now known as the Afro-German movement. Lorde inspired black women to refute the designation of &quot;Mulatto&quot;, a label which was imposed on them, and switch to the newly coined, self-given &quot;Afro-German&quot;, a term that conveyed a sense of pride. Lorde inspired Afro-German women to create a community of like-minded people. Some Afro-German women, such as Ika Hügel-Marshall, had never met another black person and the meetings offered opportunities to express thoughts and feelings.

&quot;Body of a Poet&quot;: 1995 was written as a tribute biopic written to honor Lorde. The film centers on the efforts of a young group of lesbians of color. The film celebrates the life and work of Audre Lorde from her birth to her death.

==Theory==
Her writings are based on the &quot;theory of difference&quot;, the idea that the binary opposition between men and women is overly simplistic; although feminists have found it necessary to present the illusion of a solid, unified whole, the category of women itself is full of subdivisions.

Lorde identified issues of race, class, age and ageism, sex and sexuality and, later in her life, chronic illness and disability; the latter becoming more prominent in her later years as she lived with cancer. She wrote of all of these factors as fundamental to her experience of being a woman. She argued that, although differences in gender have received all the focus, it is essential that these other differences are also recognized and addressed. &quot;Lorde,&quot; writes , &quot;puts her emphasis on the authenticity of experience. She wants her difference acknowledged but not judged; she does not want to be subsumed into the one general category of &#x27;woman. This theory is today known as intersectionality.

While acknowledging that the differences between women are wide and varied, most of Lorde&#x27;s works are concerned with two subsets that concerned her primarily – race and sexuality. In Ada Gay Griffin and Michelle Parkerson&#x27;s documentary &quot;A Litany for Survival: The Life and Work of Audre Lorde&quot;, Lorde says, &quot;Let me tell you first about what it was like being a Black woman poet in the &#x27;60s, from jump. It meant being invisible. It meant being really invisible. It meant being doubly invisible as a Black feminist woman and it meant being triply invisible as a Black lesbian and feminist&quot;.

In her essay &quot;The Erotic as Power&quot;, written in 1978 and collected in &quot;Sister Outsider&quot;, Lorde theorizes the Erotic as a site of power for women only when they learn to release it from its suppression and embrace it, without the sexualized meaning it often holds in mainstream society. She proposes that the Erotic needs to be explored and experienced wholeheartedly, because it exists not only in reference to sexuality and the sexual, but also as a feeling of enjoyment, love, and thrill that is felt towards any task or experience that satisfies women in their lives, be it reading a book or loving one&#x27;s job. She dismisses &quot;the false belief that only by the suppression of the erotic within our lives and consciousness can women be truly strong. But that strength is illusory, for it is fashioned within the context of male models of power.&quot; She explains how patriarchal society has misnamed it and used it against women, causing women to fear it. Women also fear it because the erotic is powerful and a deep feeling. Women must share each other&#x27;s power rather than use it without consent, which is abuse. They should do it as a method to connect everyone in their differences and similarities. Utilizing the erotic as power allows women to use their knowledge and power to face the issues of racism, patriarchy, and our anti-erotic society. She claims that the erotic can be used as a source of power for women to live with passion in all areas of their life. With the erotic guiding life, Lorde encourages women to use the erotic as a compass to identify what holds value in women&#x27;s lives. Furthermore, Lorde criticizes the idea of compulsory heterosexuality and the idea that women&#x27;s happiness will come through marriage, god, or religion. The idea of the erotic will empower women to not settle for what is conventionally expected or safe leaning into the idea of resisting patriarchal values put in place over women and their sexuality. Lorde sees the suppression of the erotic or conformity to heterosexual norms as a form of control over women. In order to assume control over oneself, she urges women to reclaim the erotic and assert control. She erases the erotic differences that lie between varying sexualities in order to promote these desires as a creative force for revolutionary change. 

===Feminist thought===
Lorde set out to confront issues of racism in feminist thought. She maintained that a great deal of the scholarship of white feminists served to augment the oppression of black women, a conviction that led to angry confrontation, most notably in a blunt open letter addressed to the fellow radical lesbian feminist Mary Daly, to which Lorde claimed she received no reply. Daly&#x27;s reply letter to Lorde, dated four months later, was found in 2003 in Lorde&#x27;s files after she died.

This fervent disagreement with notable white feminists furthered Lorde&#x27;s persona as an outsider: &quot;In the institutional milieu of black feminist and black lesbian feminist scholars ... and within the context of conferences sponsored by white feminist academics, Lorde stood out as an angry, accusatory, isolated black feminist lesbian voice&quot;.

The criticism was not one-sided: many white feminists were angered by Lorde&#x27;s brand of feminism. In her 1984 essay &quot;The Master&#x27;s Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master&#x27;s House&quot;, Lorde attacked what she believed was underlying racism within feminism, describing it as unrecognized dependence on the patriarchy. She argued that, by denying difference in the category of women, white feminists merely furthered old systems of oppression and that, in so doing, they were preventing any real, lasting change. Her argument aligned white feminists who did not recognize race as a feminist issue with white male slave-masters, describing both as &quot;agents of oppression&quot;.

===Lorde&#x27;s comments on feminism===
Lorde held that the key tenets of feminism were that all forms of oppression were interrelated; creating change required taking a public stand; differences should not be used to divide; revolution is a process; feelings are a form of self-knowledge that can inform and enrich activism; and acknowledging and experiencing pain helps women to transcend it.

In Lorde&#x27;s &quot;Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference&quot;, she writes: &quot;Certainly there are very real differences between us of race, age, and sex. But it is not those differences between us that are separating us. It is rather our refusal to recognize those differences, and to examine the distortions which result from our misnaming them and their effects upon human behavior and expectation.&quot; More specifically she states: &quot;As white women ignore their built-in privilege of whiteness and define woman in terms of their own experience alone, then women of color become &#x27;other&#x27;.&quot; Self-identified as &quot;a forty-nine-year-old Black lesbian feminist socialist mother of two,&quot; Lorde is considered as &quot;other, deviant, inferior, or just plain wrong&quot; in the eyes of the normative &quot;white male heterosexual capitalist&quot; social hierarchy. &quot;We speak not of human difference, but of human deviance,&quot; she writes. In this respect, her ideology coincides with womanism, which &quot;allows Black women to affirm and celebrate their color and culture in a way that feminism does not.&quot;

Lorde defines racism, sexism, ageism, heterosexism, elitism and classism altogether and explains that an &quot;ism&quot; is an idea that what is being privileged is superior and has the right to govern anything else. Lorde argues that a mythical norm is what all bodies should be. According to Lorde, the mythical norm of US culture is white, thin, male, young, heterosexual, Christian, financially secure.

===Influences on black feminism===
Lorde&#x27;s work on black feminism continues to be examined by scholars today. Jennifer C. Nash examines how black feminists acknowledge their identities and find love for themselves through those differences. Nash cites Lorde, who writes: &quot;I urge each one of us here to reach down into that deep place of knowledge inside herself and touch that terror and loathing of any difference that lives there. See whose face it wears. Then the personal as the political can begin to illuminate all our choices.&quot; Nash explains that Lorde is urging black feminists to embrace politics rather than fear it, which will lead to an improvement in society for them. Lorde adds, &quot;Black women sharing close ties with each other, politically or emotionally, are not the enemies of Black men. Too frequently, however, some Black men attempt to rule by fear those Black women who are more ally than enemy.&quot;

Lorde&#x27;s 1979 essay &quot;Sexism: An American Disease in Blackface&quot; is a sort of rallying cry to confront sexism in the black community in order to eradicate the violence within it. Lorde insists that the fight between black women and men must end to end racist politics.

In 1981, Lorde and a fellow writer friend, Barbara Smith founded Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press which was dedicated to helping other black feminist writers by provided resources, guidance and encouragement. Lorde encouraged those around her to celebrate their differences such as race, sexuality or class instead of dwelling upon them, and wanted everyone to have similar opportunities.

=== Personal identity ===
Throughout Lorde&#x27;s career she included the idea of a collective identity in many of her poems and books. She did not just identify with one category but she wanted to celebrate all parts of herself equally.

She was known to describe herself as black, lesbian, political activist, feminist, poet, mother, etc. In her novel &quot;&quot;, Lorde focuses on how her many different identities shape her life and the different experiences she has because of them. She shows us that personal identity is found within the connections between seemingly different parts of one&#x27;s life, based in lived experience, and that one&#x27;s authority to speak comes from this lived experience. Personal identity is often associated with the visual aspect of a person, but as Lies Xhonneux theorizes when identity is singled down to just what you see, some people, even within minority groups, can become invisible.

Lorde&#x27;s work also focused on the importance of acknowledging, respecting and celebrating our differences as well as our commonalities in defining identity. In &quot;The Master&#x27;s Tools&quot;, she wrote that many people choose to pretend the differences between us do not exist, or that these differences are insurmountable, adding, &quot;Difference must be not merely tolerated, but seen as a fund of necessary polarities between which our creativity can spark like a dialectic.&quot;

Lorde urged her readers to delve into and discover these differences, discussing how ignoring differences can lead to ignoring any bias and prejudice that might come with these differences, while acknowledging them can enrich our visions and our joint struggles. She wrote that we need to constructively deal with the differences between people and recognize that unity does not equal identicality. In &quot;I Am Your Sister&quot;, she urged activists to take responsibility for learning this, even if it meant self-teaching, &quot;...which might be better used in redefining ourselves and devising realistic scenarios for altering the present and constructing the future.&quot;

In &quot;The Cancer Journals&quot; she wrote &quot;If I didn&#x27;t define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people&#x27;s fantasies for me and eaten alive.&quot; She stressed the idea of personal identity being more than just what people see or think of a person, but is something that must be defined by the individual, based on the person&#x27;s lived experience. &quot;The House of Difference&quot; is a phrase that originates in Lorde&#x27;s identity theories. Her idea was that everyone is different from each other and it is these collective differences that make us who we are, instead of one small aspect in isolation. Focusing on all of the aspects of one&#x27;s identity brings people together more than choosing one small piece to identify with.

Lorde&#x27;s works &quot;Coal&quot; and &quot;The Black Unicorn&quot; are two examples of poetry that encapsulates her black, feminist identity. Each poem, including those included in the book of published poems focus on the idea of identity, and how identity itself is not straightforward. Many Literary critics assumed that &quot;Coal&quot; was Lorde&#x27;s way of shaping race in terms of coal and diamonds. Lorde herself stated that those interpretations were incorrect because identity was not so simply defined and her poems were not to be oversimplified.

While highlighting Lorde&#x27;s intersectional points through a lens that focuses on race, gender, socioeconomic status/class and so on, we must also embrace one of her salient identities; Lorde was not afraid to assert her differences, such as skin color and sexual orientation, but used her own identity against toxic black male masculinity. Lorde used those identities within her work and used her own life to teach others the importance of being different. She was not ashamed to claim her identity and used it to her own creative advantages.

While highlighting Lorde&#x27;s intersectional points through a lens that focuses on race, gender, socioeconomic status/class and so on, we must also embrace one of her salient identities; lesbianism. She was a lesbian and navigated spaces interlocking her womanhood, gayness and blackness in ways that trumped white feminism, predominantly white gay spaces and toxic black male masculinity. Lorde used those identities within her work and ultimately it guided her to create pieces that embodied lesbianism in a light that educated people of many social classes and identities on the issues black lesbian women face in society.

=== Contributions to the third-wave feminist discourse ===
Around the 1960s, second-wave feminism became centered around discussions and debates about capitalism as a &quot;biased, discriminatory, and unfair&quot; institution, especially within the context of the rise of globalization.

Third-wave feminism emerged in the 1990s after calls for &quot;a more differentiated feminism&quot; by first-world women of color and women in developing nations, such as Audre Lorde, who maintained her critiques of first world feminism for tending to veer toward &quot;third-world homogenization&quot;. This term was coined by radical dependency theorist, Andre Gunder Frank, to describe the inconsideration of the unique histories of developing countries (in the process of forming development agendas). Audre Lorde was critical of the first world feminist movement &quot;for downplaying sexual, racial, and class differences&quot; and the unique power structures and cultural factors which vary by region, nation, community, etc.

Other feminist scholars of this period, like Chandra Talpade Mohanty, echoed Lorde&#x27;s sentiments. Collectively they called for a &quot;feminist politics of location, which theorized that women were subject to particular assemblies of oppression, and therefore that all women emerged with particular rather than generic identities&quot;. While they encouraged a global community of women, Audre Lorde, in particular, felt the cultural homogenization of third-world women could only lead to a disguised form of oppression with its own forms of &quot;othering&quot; women in developing nations into figures of deviance and non-actors in theories of their own development.

====Essay====
Originally published in &quot;Sister Outsider&quot;, a collection of essays and speeches, Audre Lorde cautioned against the &quot;institutionalized rejection of difference&quot; in her essay, &quot;Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference&quot;, fearing that when &quot;we do not develop tools for using human difference as a springboard for creative change within our lives[,] we speak not of human difference, but of human deviance&quot;. Lorde saw this already happening with the lack of inclusion of literature from women of color in the second-wave feminist discourse. Poetry, considered lesser than prose and more common among lower class and working people, was rejected from women&#x27;s magazine collectives which Lorde claims have robbed &quot;women of each other&#x27;s energy and creative insight&quot;. She found that &quot;the literature of women of Color [was] seldom included in women&#x27;s literature courses and almost never in other literature courses, nor in women&#x27;s studies as a whole&quot; and pointed to the &quot;othering&quot; of women of color and women in developing nations as the reason. By homogenizing these communities and ignoring their difference, &quot;women of Color become &#x27;other,&#x27; the outside whose experiences and tradition is too &#x27;alien&#x27; to comprehend&quot;, and thus, seemingly unworthy of scholarly attention and differentiated scholarship. Lorde expands on this idea of rejecting the other saying that it is a product of our capitalistic society. Psychologically, people have been trained to react to discontentment by ignoring it. When ignoring a problem does not work, they are forced to either conform or destroy. She contends that people have reacted in this matter to differences in sex, race, and gender: ignore, conform, or destroy. Instead, she states that differences should be approached with curiosity or understanding. Lorde denounces the concept of having to choose a superior and an inferior when comparing two things. In the case of people, expression, and identity, she claims that there should be a third option of equality. However, Lorde emphasizes in her essay that differences should not be squashed or unacknowledged. There is no denying the difference in experience of black women and white women, as shown through example in Lorde&#x27;s essay, but Lorde fights against the premise that difference is bad.

Audre Lorde called for the embracing of these differences. In the same essay, she proclaimed, &quot;now we must recognize difference among women who are our equals, neither inferior nor superior, and devise ways to use each other&#x27;s difference to enrich our visions and our joint struggles&quot; Doing so would lead to more inclusive and thus, more effective global feminist goals. Lorde writes that women must &quot;develop new definitions of power and new patterns of relating across difference. The old definitions have not served us&quot;. By unification, Lorde writes that women can reverse the oppression that they face and create better communities for themselves and loved ones. Lorde theorized that true development in Third World communities would and even &quot;the future of our earth may depend upon the ability of all women to identify and develop new definitions of power and new patterns of relating across differences.&quot; In other words, the individual voices and concerns of women and color and women in developing nations would be the first step in attaining the autonomy with the potential to develop and transform their communities effectively in the age (and future) of globalization.

====Speeches====

In a keynote speech at the National Third-World Gay and Lesbian Conference on October 13, 1979, titled, &quot;When will the ignorance end?&quot; Lorde reminded and cautioned the attendees, &quot;There is a wonderful diversity of groups within this conference, and a wonderful diversity between us within those groups. That diversity can be a generative force, a source of energy fueling our visions of action for the future. We must not let diversity be used to tear us apart from each other, nor from our communities that is the mistake they made about us. I do not want us to make it ourselves... and we must never forget those lessons: that we cannot separate our oppressions, nor yet are they the same&quot; In other words, while common experiences in racism, sexism, and homophobia had brought the group together and that commonality could not be ignored, there must still be a recognition of their individualized humanity.

Years later, on August 27, 1983, Audre Lorde delivered an address as part of the &quot;Litany of Commitment&quot; at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. &quot;Today we march,&quot; she said, &quot;lesbians and gay men and our children, standing in our own names together with all our struggling sisters and brothers here and around the world, in the Middle East, in Central America, in the Caribbean and South Africa, sharing our commitment to work for a joint livable future. We know we do not have to become copies of each other to be able to work together. We know that when we join hands across the table of our difference, our diversity gives us great power. When we can arm ourselves with the strength and vision from all of our diverse communities, then we will in truth all be free at last.&quot;

====Interview====

Afro-German feminist scholar and author Dr. Marion Kraft interviewed Audre Lorde in 1986 to discuss a number of her literary works and poems. In this interview, Audre Lorde articulated hope for the next wave of feminist scholarship and discourse. When asked by Kraft, &quot;Do you see any development of the awareness about the importance of differences within the white feminist movement?&quot; Lorde replied with both critiques and hope:Well, the feminist movement, the white feminist movement, has been notoriously slow to recognize that racism is a feminist concern, not one that is altruistic, but one that is part and parcel of feminist consciousness... I think, in fact, though, that things are slowly changing and that there are white women now who recognize that in the interest of genuine coalition, they must see that we are not the same. Black feminism is not white feminism in Blackface. It is an intricate movement coming out of the lives, aspirations, and realities of Black women. We share some things with white women, and there are other things we do not share. We must be able to come together around those things we share.Miriam Kraft summarized Lorde&#x27;s position when reflecting on the interview; &quot;Yes, we have different historical, social, and cultural backgrounds, different sexual orientations; different aspirations and visions; different skin colors and ages. But we share common experiences and a common goal. Our experiences are rooted in the oppressive forces of racism in various societies, and our goal is our mutual concern to work toward &#x27;a future which has not yet been&#x27; in Audre&#x27;s words.&quot;

==Lorde and womanism==
Lorde&#x27;s criticism of feminists of the 1960s identified issues of race, class, age, gender and sexuality. Similarly, author and poet Alice Walker coined the term &quot;womanist&quot; in an attempt to distinguish black female and minority female experience from &quot;feminism&quot;. While &quot;feminism&quot; is defined as &quot;a collection of movements and ideologies that share a common goal: to define, establish, and achieve equal political, economic, cultural, personal, and social rights for women&quot; by imposing simplistic opposition between &quot;men&quot; and &quot;women&quot;, the theorists and activists of the 1960s and 1970s usually neglected the experiential difference caused by factors such as race and gender among different social groups.

===Womanism and its ambiguity===
Womanism&#x27;s existence naturally opens various definitions and interpretations. Alice Walker&#x27;s comments on womanism, that &quot;womanist is to feminist as purple is to lavender&quot;, suggests that the scope of study of womanism includes and exceeds that of feminism. In its narrowest definition, womanism is the black feminist movement that was formed in response to the growth of racial stereotypes in the feminist movement.

In a broad sense, however, womanism is &quot;a social change perspective based upon the everyday problems and experiences of Black women and other women of minority demographics,&quot; but also one that &quot;more broadly seeks methods to eradicate inequalities not just for Black women, but for all people&quot; by imposing socialist ideology and equality. However, because womanism is open to interpretation, one of the most common criticisms of womanism is its lack of a unified set of tenets. It is also criticized for its lack of discussion of sexuality.

Lorde actively strove for the change of culture within the feminist community by implementing womanist ideology. In the journal &quot;Anger Among Allies: Audre Lorde&#x27;s 1981 Keynote Admonishing the National Women&#x27;s Studies Association&quot;, it is stated that her speech contributed to communication with scholars&#x27; understanding of human biases. While &quot;anger, marginalized communities, and US Culture&quot; are the major themes of the speech, Lorde implemented various communication techniques to shift subjectivities of the &quot;white feminist&quot; audience.

She further explained that &quot;we are working in a context of oppression and threat, the cause of which is certainly not the angers which lie between us, but rather that virulent hatred leveled against all women, people of color, lesbians and gay men, poor people – against all of us who are seeking to examine the particulars of our lives as we resist our oppressions, moving towards coalition and effective action.&quot;

===Womanism and sexuality===
Contrary to this, Lorde was very open to her own sexuality and sexual awakening. In &quot;Zami: A New Spelling of My Name&quot;, her &quot;biomythography&quot; (a term coined by Lorde that combines &quot;biography&quot; and &quot;mythology&quot;) she writes, &quot;Years afterward when I was grown, whenever I thought about the way I smelled that day, I would have a fantasy of my mother, her hands wiped dry from the washing, and her apron untied and laid neatly away, looking down upon me lying on the couch, and then slowly, thoroughly, our touching and caressing each other&#x27;s most secret places.&quot; According to scholar Anh Hua, Lorde turns female abjection – menstruation, sexuality, and incest with the mother – into scenes of female relationship and connection.

Lorde&#x27;s impact on lesbian society has been significant. Lorde donated some of her manuscripts and personal papers to the Lesbian Herstory Archives.

==Personal life==
In 1962, Lorde married attorney Edwin Rollins, who was a white, gay man. Audre had been living openly as a lesbian since college, however due to LGBTQ+ discrimination, they both decided to remain closeted. Audre and Edwin maintained an open relationship, allowing each other to pursue same-sex relationships. She and Rollins divorced in 1970 after having two children, Elizabeth and Jonathan. In 1966, Lorde became head librarian at Town School Library in New York City, where she remained until 1968.

During her time in Mississippi in 1968, she met Frances Clayton, a white lesbian and professor of psychology who became her romantic partner until 1989. Their relationship continued for the remainder of Lorde&#x27;s life, and they lived openly as a lesbian couple.

Lorde was briefly romantically involved with the sculptor and painter Mildred Thompson after meeting her in Nigeria at the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture (FESTAC 77). The two were involved during the time that Thompson lived in Washington, D.C.

Lorde and her life partner, black feminist Dr. Gloria Joseph, resided together on Joseph&#x27;s native land of St. Croix. Lorde and Joseph had been seeing each other since 1981 , and after Lorde&#x27;s liver cancer diagnosis, she officially left Clayton for Joseph, moving to St. Croix in 1986. The couple remained together until Lorde&#x27;s death. Together they founded several organizations such as the Che Lumumba School for Truth, Women&#x27;s Coalition of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, Sisterhood in Support of Sisters in South Africa, and Doc Loc Apiary.

==Last years==
Lorde was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 1978 and underwent a mastectomy. Six years later, she found out her breast cancer had metastasized in her liver. After her first diagnosis, she wrote &quot;The Cancer Journals,&quot; which won the American Library Association Gay Caucus Book of the Year Award in 1981. She was featured as the subject of a documentary called &quot;A Litany for Survival: The Life and Work of Audre Lorde,&quot; which shows her as an author, poet, human rights activist, feminist, lesbian, a teacher, a survivor, and a crusader against bigotry. She is quoted as saying: &quot;What I leave behind has a life of its own. I&#x27;ve said this about poetry; I&#x27;ve said it about children. Well, in a sense I&#x27;m saying it about the very artifact of who I have been.&quot;

From 1991 until her death, she was the New York State Poet laureate. When designating her as such, then-governor Mario Cuomo said of Lorde, &quot;Her imagination is charged by a sharp sense of racial injustice and cruelty, of sexual prejudice... She cries out against it as the voice of indignant humanity. Audre Lorde is the voice of the eloquent outsider who speaks in a language that can reach and touch people everywhere.&quot; In 1992, she received the Bill Whitehead Award for Lifetime Achievement from Publishing Triangle. In 2001, Publishing Triangle instituted the Audre Lorde Award to honour works of lesbian poetry.

Lorde died of breast cancer at the age of 58 on November 17, 1992, in St. Croix, where she had been living with Gloria Joseph. In an African naming ceremony before her death, she took the name Gamba Adisa, which means &quot;Warrior: She Who Makes Her Meaning Known&quot;.

The Callen-Lorde Community Health Center, an organization in New York City named for Michael Callen and Lorde, is dedicated to providing medical health care to the city&#x27;s LGBT population without regard to ability to pay. Callen-Lorde is the only primary care center in New York City created specifically to serve the LGBT community.

The Audre Lorde Project, founded in 1994, is a Brooklyn-based organization for LGBT people of color. The organization concentrates on community organizing and radical nonviolent activism around progressive issues within New York City, especially relating to LGBT communities, AIDS and HIV activism, pro-immigrant activism, prison reform, and organizing among youth of color.

In June 2019, Lorde was one of the inaugural fifty American &quot;pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes&quot; inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City&#x27;s Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall&#x27;s unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

In 2014, Lorde was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display in Chicago, Illinois, that celebrates LGBTQ history and people.

The Audre Lorde Award is an annual literary award presented by Publishing Triangle to honor works of lesbian poetry, first presented in 2001.

In June 2019, Lorde&#x27;s residence in Staten Island was given landmark designation by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.

For their first match of March 2019, the women of the United States women&#x27;s national soccer team each wore a jersey with the name of a woman they were honoring on the back; Megan Rapinoe chose the name of Lorde.

The archives of Audre Lorde are located across various repositories in the United States and Germany. The Audre Lorde Papers are held at Spelman College Archives in Atlanta. As the description in its finding aid states &quot;The collection includes Lorde&#x27;s books, correspondence, poetry, prose, periodical contributions, manuscripts, diaries, journals, video and audio recordings, and a host of biographical and miscellaneous material.&quot; Held at John F. Kennedy Institute of North American Studies at Free University of Berlin (Freie Universität), the Audre Lorde Archive holds correspondence and teaching materials related to Lorde&#x27;s teaching and visits to Freie University from 1984 to 1992. The Audre Lorde collection at Lesbian Herstory Archives in New York contains audio recordings related to the March on Washington on October 14, 1979, which dealt with the civil rights of the gay and lesbian community as well as poetry readings and speeches.

In January 2021, Audre was named an official &quot;Broad You Should Know&quot; on the podcast &quot;Broads You Should Know&quot;.
On February 18, 2021, Google celebrated her 87th birthday with a Google Doodle.

On April 29, 2022, the International Astronomical Union approved the name Lorde for a crater on Mercury.

On May 10, 2022, 68th Street and Lexington Avenue by Hunter College was renamed &quot;Audre Lorde Way.&quot;

In September 2023, the northern part of the Manteuffelstrasse located in Berlin Kreuzberg was renamed to Audre-Lorde-Straße.

Lorde is the subject of a 2024 biography titled &quot;Survival Is a Promise&quot;, by Alexis Pauline Gumbs.

<text>Industrialisation (UK) or industrialization (US) is the period of social and economic change that transforms a human group from an agrarian society into an industrial society. This involves an extensive reorganisation of an economy for the purpose of manufacturing. Industrialisation is associated with increase of polluting industries heavily dependent on fossil fuels. With the increasing focus on sustainable development and green industrial policy practices, industrialisation increasingly includes technological leapfrogging, with direct investment in more advanced, cleaner technologies.

The reorganisation of the economy has many unintended consequences both economically and socially. As industrial workers&#x27; incomes rise, markets for consumer goods and services of all kinds tend to expand and provide a further stimulus to industrial investment and economic growth. Moreover, family structures tend to shift as extended families tend to no longer live together in one household, location or place.

==Background==

The first transformation from an agricultural to an industrial economy is known as the Industrial Revolution and took place from the mid-18th to early 19th century. It began in Great Britain, spreading to Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, and France and eventually to other areas in Europe and North America. Characteristics of this early industrialisation were technological progress, a shift from rural work to industrial labour, and financial investments in new industrial structures. Later commentators have called this the First Industrial Revolution.

The &quot;Second Industrial Revolution&quot; labels the later changes that came about in the mid-19th century after the refinement of the steam engine, the invention of the internal combustion engine, the harnessing of electricity and the construction of canals, railways, and electric-power lines. The invention of the assembly line gave this phase a boost. Coal mines, steelworks, and textile factories replaced homes as the place of work.

By the end of the 20th century, East Asia had become one of the most recently industrialised regions of the world.

There is considerable literature on the factors facilitating industrial modernisation and enterprise development.

==Social consequences==

The Industrial Revolution was accompanied by significant changes in the social structure, the main change being a transition from farm work to factory-related activities. This has resulted in the concept of Social class, i.e., hierarchical social status defined by an individual&#x27;s economic power. It has changed the family system as most people moved into cities, with extended family living apart becoming more common. The movement into more dense urban areas from less dense agricultural areas has consequently increased the transmission of diseases. The place of women in society has shifted from primary caregivers to breadwinners, thus reducing the number of children per household. Furthermore, industrialisation contributed to increased cases of child labour and thereafter education systems.

===Urbanisation===
As the Industrial Revolution was a shift from the agrarian society, people migrated from villages in search of jobs to places where factories were established. This shifting of rural people led to urbanisation and an increase in the population of towns. The concentration of labour in factories has increased urbanisation and the size of settlements, to serve and house the factory workers.

=== Exploitation ===
===Changes in family structure===

Family structure changes with industrialisation. Sociologist Talcott Parsons noted that in pre-industrial societies there is an extended family structure spanning many generations who probably remained in the same location for generations. In industrialised societies the nuclear family, consisting of only parents and their growing children, predominates. Families and children reaching adulthood are more mobile and tend to relocate to where jobs exist. Extended family bonds become more tenuous. One of the most important criticisms of industrialisation is that it caused children to stay away from home for many hours and to use them as cheap workers in factories.

== Industrialisation in East Asia ==
Between the early 1960s and 1990s, the Four Asian Tigers underwent rapid industrialisation and maintained exceptionally high growth rates.

==Current situation==
 the international development community (World Bank, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), many United Nations departments, FAO WHO ILO and UNESCO, endorses development policies like water purification or primary education and co-operation amongst third world communities. Some members of the economic communities do not consider contemporary industrialisation policies as being adequate to the global south (Third World countries) or beneficial in the longer term, with the perception that they may only create inefficient local industries unable to compete in the free-trade dominated political order which industrialisation has fostered. Environmentalism and Green politics may represent more visceral reactions to industrial growth. Nevertheless, repeated examples in history of apparently successful industrialisation (Britain, Soviet Union, South Korea, China, etc.) may make conventional industrialisation seem like an attractive or even natural path forward, especially as populations grow, consumerist expectations rise and agricultural opportunities diminish.

The relationships among economic growth, employment, and poverty reduction are complex, and higher productivity can sometimes lead to static or even lower employment (see jobless recovery).
There are differences across sectors, whereby manufacturing is less able than the tertiary sector to accommodate both increased productivity and employment opportunities; more than 40% of the world&#x27;s employees are &quot;working poor&quot;, whose incomes fail to keep themselves and their families above the $2-a-day poverty line. There is also a phenomenon of deindustrialisation, as in the former USSR countries&#x27; transition to market economies, and the agriculture sector is often the key sector in absorbing the resultant unemployment.

<text>Rudolf Alexander de Wild (born 24 April 1969) is a Dutch radio host. He is also a former DJ, VJ and was one of the faces of the now-defunct television network Talpa.

On 6 May 2002, when he worked for radio station 3FM, he interviewed Pim Fortuyn. After the interview De Wild and Fortuyn stepped outside where De Wild witnessed the assassination of Fortuyn. De Wild stated that he narrowly avoided being shot himself and suffered from trauma and PTSD as a result of witnessing Fortuyn&#x27;s murder.

In 2004, De Wild started his show Ruuddewild.nl on Radio 538. He got a timeslot between 16.00 and 19.00. At that time he also worked for the television channel Talpa of John de Mol. He presented Big Brother 5 together with Bridget Maasland.

== Conflict with Radio 538 ==

In the summer of 2007, De Wild did not return to present his program on Radio 538 after his holiday. Official statements said De Wild was suffering from burnout, but rumours circulated that he had tried to break out of his contract with Radio 538 because he felt that he was not getting enough creative freedom from the station. His show Ruuddewild.nl went on without him, and was presented by Lindo Duvall, another deejay at Radio 538.

Because the show was still called Ruuddewild.nl, and Radio 538 repeatedly stated that De Wild really was ill, it appeared De Wild was going to return. But on 25 October 2007, Ruuddewild.nl disappeared from Radio 538&#x27;s schedule and was replaced by a nameless afternoon show, still presented by Lindo Duvall. Radio 538 then stated it had terminated De Wild&#x27;s contract.

== Return to Dutch radio ==

On 10 March 2008, Ruud de Wild started presenting the morning-show on Dutch radio station Q-Music, again called Ruuddewild.nl. Sidekick on this new show is Jeroen Kijk in de Vegte, who worked with De Wild before at 3FM, and producer is Martijn Zuurveen. In 2010, Ruud de Wild went back to Radio 538. His contract was terminated in April 2015, when 538 suddenly announced his slot was to be taken over by the Coen en Sander Show. De Wild now works for NPO Radio 2.

In December 2020, De Wild drew criticism for pronouncing the title of the song &quot;Niggas in Paris&quot; uncensored while presenting the &quot;Top 2000&quot;.

== Personal ==
In 2019 he had a relationship with fashion designer Olcay Gulsen. The couple separated in 2023.

<text>Waste management or waste disposal includes the processes and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal.
This includes the collection, transport, treatment, and disposal of waste, together with monitoring and regulation of the waste management process and waste-related laws, technologies, and economic mechanisms.

Waste can either be solid, liquid, or gases and each type has different methods of disposal and management. Waste management deals with all types of waste, including industrial, biological, household, municipal, organic, biomedical, radioactive wastes. In some cases, waste can pose a threat to human health. Health issues are associated with the entire process of waste management. Health issues can also arise indirectly or directly: directly through the handling of solid waste, and indirectly through the consumption of water, soil, and food. Waste is produced by human activity, for example, the extraction and processing of raw materials. Waste management is intended to reduce the adverse effects of waste on human health, the environment, planetary resources, and aesthetics.

The aim of waste management is to reduce the dangerous effects of such waste on the environment and human health. A big part of waste management deals with municipal solid waste, which is created by industrial, commercial, and household activity.

Waste management practices are not the same across countries (developed and developing nations); regions (urban and rural areas), and residential and industrial sectors can all take different approaches.

Proper management of waste is important for building sustainable and liveable cities, but it remains a challenge for many developing countries and cities. A report found that effective waste management is relatively expensive, usually comprising 20%–50% of municipal budgets. Operating this essential municipal service requires integrated systems that are efficient, sustainable, and socially supported. A large portion of waste management practices deal with municipal solid waste (MSW) which is the bulk of the waste that is created by household, industrial, and commercial activity. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), municipal solid waste is expected to reach approximately 3.4 Gt by 2050; however, policies and lawmaking can reduce the amount of waste produced in different areas and cities of the world. Measures of waste management include measures for integrated techno-economic mechanisms of a circular economy, effective disposal facilities, export and import control and optimal sustainable design of products that are produced.

In the first systematic review of the scientific evidence around global waste, its management, and its impact on human health and life, authors concluded that about a fourth of all the municipal solid terrestrial waste is not collected and an additional fourth is mismanaged after collection, often being burned in open and uncontrolled fires – or close to one billion tons per year when combined. They also found that broad priority areas each lack a &quot;high-quality research base&quot;, partly due to the absence of &quot;substantial research funding&quot;, which motivated scientists often require. Electronic waste (ewaste) includes discarded computer monitors, motherboards, mobile phones and chargers, compact discs (CDs), headphones, television sets, air conditioners and refrigerators. According to the Global E-waste Monitor 2017, India generates ~ 2 million tonnes (Mte) of e-waste annually and ranks fifth among the e-waste producing countries, after the United States, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Japan and Germany.

Effective &#x27;Waste Management&#x27; involves the practice of &#x27;7R&#x27; - &#x27;R&#x27;efuse, &#x27;R&#x27;educe&#x27;, &#x27;R&#x27;euse, &#x27;R&#x27;epair, &#x27;R&#x27;epurpose, &#x27;R&#x27;ecycle and &#x27;R&#x27;ecover. Amongst these &#x27;7R&#x27;s, the first two (&#x27;Refuse&#x27; and &#x27;Reduce&#x27;) relate to the non-creation of waste - by refusing to buy non-essential products and by reducing consumption. The next two (&#x27;Reuse&#x27; and &#x27;Repair&#x27;) refer to increasing the usage of the existing product, with or without the substitution of certain parts of the product. &#x27;Repurpose&#x27; and &#x27;Recycle&#x27; involve maximum usage of the materials used in the product, and &#x27;Recover&#x27; is the least preferred and least efficient waste management practice involving the recovery of embedded energy in the waste material. For example, burning the waste to produce heat (and electricity from heat). Certain non-biodegradable products are also dumped away as &#x27;Disposal&#x27;, and this is not a &quot;waste-&#x27;management&#x27;&quot; practice.

== Principles of waste management ==
=== Waste hierarchy ===
The waste hierarchy refers to the &quot;3 Rs&quot; Reduce, Reuse and Recycle, which classifies waste management strategies according to their desirability in terms of waste minimisation. The waste hierarchy is the bedrock of most waste minimization strategies. The aim of the waste hierarchy is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to generate the minimum amount of end waste; see: resource recovery. The waste hierarchy is represented as a pyramid because the basic premise is that policies should promote measures to prevent the generation of waste. The next step or preferred action is to seek alternative uses for the waste that has been generated, i.e., by re-use. The next is recycling which includes composting. Following this step is material recovery and waste-to-energy. The final action is disposal, in landfills or through incineration without energy recovery. This last step is the final resort for waste that has not been prevented, diverted, or recovered. The waste hierarchy represents the progression of a product or material through the sequential stages of the pyramid of waste management. The hierarchy represents the latter parts of the life-cycle for each product.

=== Life-cycle of a product ===

The life-cycle of a product, often referred to as the product lifecycle, encompasses several key stages that begin with the design phase and proceed through manufacture, distribution, and primary use. After these initial stages, the product moves through the waste hierarchy&#x27;s stages of reduce, reuse, and recycle. Each phase in this lifecycle presents unique opportunities for policy intervention, allowing stakeholders to rethink the necessity of the product, redesign it to minimize its waste potential, and extend its useful life.

During the design phase, considerations can be made to ensure that products are created with fewer resources, are more durable, and are easier to repair or recycle. This stage is critical for embedding sustainability into the product from the outset. Designers can select materials that have lower environmental impacts and create products that require less energy and resources to produce.

Manufacturing offers another crucial point for reducing waste and conserving resources. Innovations in production processes can lead to more efficient use of materials and energy, while also minimizing the generation of by-products and emissions. Adopting cleaner production techniques and improving manufacturing efficiency can significantly reduce the environmental footprint of a product.

Distribution involves the logistics of getting the product from the manufacturer to the consumer. Optimizing this stage can involve reducing packaging, choosing more sustainable transportation methods, and improving supply chain efficiencies to lower the overall environmental impact. Efficient logistics planning can also help in reducing fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the transport of goods.

The primary use phase of a product&#x27;s lifecycle is where consumers interact with the product. Policies and practices that encourage responsible use, regular maintenance, and the proper functioning of products can extend their lifespan, thus reducing the need for frequent replacements and decreasing overall waste.

Once the product reaches the end of its primary use, it enters the waste hierarchy&#x27;s stages. The first stage, reduction, involves efforts to decrease the volume and toxicity of waste generated. This can be achieved by encouraging consumers to buy less, use products more efficiently, and choose items with minimal packaging.

The reuse stage encourages finding alternative uses for products, whether through donation, resale, or repurposing. Reuse extends the life of products and delays their entry into the waste stream.

Recycling, the final preferred stage, involves processing materials to create new products, thus closing the loop in the material lifecycle. Effective recycling programs can significantly reduce the need for virgin materials and the environmental impacts associated with extracting and processing those materials.

Product life-cycle analysis (LCA) is a comprehensive method for evaluating the environmental impacts associated with all stages of a product&#x27;s life. By systematically assessing these impacts, LCA helps identify opportunities to improve environmental performance and resource efficiency. Through optimizing product designs, manufacturing processes, and end-of-life management, LCA aims to maximize the use of the world&#x27;s limited resources and minimize the unnecessary generation of waste.

In summary, the product lifecycle framework underscores the importance of a holistic approach to product design, use, and disposal. By considering each stage of the lifecycle and implementing policies and practices that promote sustainability, it is possible to significantly reduce the environmental impact of products and contribute to a more sustainable future.

===Resource efficiency===

Resource efficiency reflects the understanding that global economic growth and development can not be sustained at current production and consumption patterns. Globally, humanity extracts more resources to produce goods than the planet can replenish. Resource efficiency is the reduction of the environmental impact from the production and consumption of these goods, from final raw material extraction to the last use and disposal.

===Polluter-pays principle===
The polluter-pays principle mandates that the polluting parties pay for the impact on the environment. With respect to waste management, this generally refers to the requirement for a waste generator to pay for appropriate disposal of the unrecoverable materials.

==History==

Throughout most of history, the amount of waste generated by humans was insignificant due to low levels of population density and exploitation of natural resources. Common waste produced during pre-modern times was mainly ashes and human biodegradable waste, and these were released back into the ground locally, with minimum environmental impact. Tools made out of wood or metal were generally reused or passed down through the generations.

However, some civilizations have been more profligate in their waste output than others. In particular, the Maya of Central America had a fixed monthly ritual, in which the people of the village would gather together and burn their rubbish in large dumps.

===Modern era===

Following the onset of the Industrial Revolution, industrialisation, and the sustained urban growth of large population centres in England, the buildup of waste in the cities caused a rapid deterioration in levels of sanitation and the general quality of urban life. The streets became choked with filth due to the lack of waste clearance regulations. Calls for the establishment of municipal authority with waste removal powers occurred as early as 1751, when Corbyn Morris in London proposed that &quot;... as the preservation of the health of the people is of great importance, it is proposed that the cleaning of this city, should be put under one uniform public management, and all the filth be...conveyed by the Thames to proper distance in the country&quot;.

However, it was not until the mid-19th century, spurred by increasingly devastating cholera outbreaks and the emergence of a public health debate that the first legislation on the issue emerged. Highly influential in this new focus was the report &quot;The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population&quot; in 1842 of the social reformer, Edwin Chadwick, in which he argued for the importance of adequate waste removal and management facilities to improve the health and wellbeing of the city&#x27;s population.

In the UK, the Nuisance Removal and Disease Prevention Act 1846 began what was to be a steadily evolving process of the provision of regulated waste management in London. The Metropolitan Board of Works was the first citywide authority that centralized sanitation regulation for the rapidly expanding city, and the Public Health Act 1875 made it compulsory for every household to deposit their weekly waste in &quot;moveable receptacles&quot; for disposal—the first concept for a dustbin. In the Ashanti Empire by the 19th century, there existed a Public Works Department that was responsible for sanitation in Kumasi and its suburbs. They kept the streets clean daily and commanded civilians to keep their compounds clean and weeded.
The dramatic increase in waste for disposal led to the creation of the first incineration plants, or, as they were then called, &quot;destructors&quot;. In 1874, the first incinerator was built in Nottingham by Manlove, Alliott &amp; Co. Ltd. to the design of Alfred Fryer. However, these were met with opposition on account of the large amounts of ash they produced and which wafted over the neighbouring areas.

Similar municipal systems of waste disposal sprung up at the turn of the 20th century in other large cities of Europe and North America. In 1895, New York City became the first U.S. city with public-sector garbage management.

Early garbage removal trucks were simply open-bodied dump trucks pulled by a team of horses. They became motorized in the early part of the 20th century and the first closed-body trucks to eliminate odours with a dumping lever mechanism were introduced in the 1920s in Britain. These were soon equipped with &#x27;hopper mechanisms&#x27; where the scooper was loaded at floor level and then hoisted mechanically to deposit the waste in the truck. The Garwood Load Packer was the first truck in 1938, to incorporate a hydraulic compactor.

==Waste handling and transport==

Waste collection methods vary widely among different countries and regions. Domestic waste collection services are often provided by local government authorities, or by private companies for industrial and commercial waste. Some areas, especially those in less developed countries, do not have formal waste-collection systems.

===Waste handling and transport===
Curbside collection is the most common method of disposal in most European countries, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and many other parts of the developed world in which waste is collected at regular intervals by specialised trucks. This is often associated with curb-side waste segregation. In rural areas, waste may need to be taken to a transfer station. Waste collected is then transported to an appropriate disposal facility. 
In some areas, vacuum collection is used in which waste is transported from the home or commercial premises by vacuum along small bore tubes. Systems are in use in Europe and North America.

In some jurisdictions, unsegregated waste is collected at the curb-side or from waste transfer stations and then sorted into recyclables and unusable waste. Such systems are capable of sorting large volumes of solid waste, salvaging recyclables, and turning the rest into bio-gas and soil conditioners. 
In San Francisco, the local government established its &quot;Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance&quot; in support of its goal of &quot;Zero waste by 2020&quot;, requiring everyone in the city to keep recyclables and compostables out of the landfill. The three streams are collected with the curbside &quot;Fantastic 3&quot; bin system – blue for recyclables, green for compostables, and black for landfill-bound materials – provided to residents and businesses and serviced by San Francisco&#x27;s sole refuse hauler, Recology. The city&#x27;s &quot;Pay-As-You-Throw&quot; system charges customers by the volume of landfill-bound materials, which provides a financial incentive to separate recyclables and compostables from other discards. The city&#x27;s Department of the Environment&#x27;s Zero Waste Program has led the city to achieve 80% diversion, the highest diversion rate in North America. Other businesses such as Waste Industries use a variety of colors to distinguish between trash and recycling cans. In addition, in some areas of the world the disposal of municipal solid waste can cause environmental strain due to official not having benchmarks that help measure the environmental sustainability of certain practices.

===Waste segregation===

This is the separation of wet waste and dry waste. The purpose is to recycle dry waste easily and to use wet waste as compost. When segregating waste, the amount of waste that gets landfilled reduces considerably, resulting in lower levels of air and water pollution. Importantly, waste segregation should be based on the type of waste and the most appropriate treatment and disposal. This also makes it easier to apply different processes to the waste, like composting, recycling, and incineration. It is important to practice waste management and segregation as a community. One way to practice waste management is to ensure there is awareness. The process of waste segregation should be explained to the community.

Segregated waste is also often cheaper to dispose of because it does not require as much manual sorting as mixed waste. There are a number of important reasons why waste segregation is important such as legal obligations, cost savings, and protection of human health and the environment. Institutions should make it as easy as possible for their staff to correctly segregate their waste. This can include labelling, making sure there are enough accessible bins, and clearly indicating why segregation is so important. Labeling is especially important when dealing with nuclear waste due to how much harm to human health the excess products of the nuclear cycle can cause.

== Hazards of waste management ==
There are multiple facets of waste management that all come with hazards, both for those around the disposal site and those who work within waste management. Exposure to waste of any kind can be detrimental to the health of the individual, primary conditions that worsen with exposure to waste are asthma and tuberculosis. The exposure to waste on an average individual is highly dependent on the conditions around them, those in less developed or lower income areas are more susceptible to the effects of waste product, especially though chemical waste. The range of hazards due to waste is extremely large and covers every type of waste, not only chemical. There are many different guidelines to follow for disposing different types of waste.

The hazards of incineration are a large risk to many variable communities, including underdeveloped countries and countries or cities with little space for landfills or alternatives. Burning waste is an easily accessible option for many people around the globe, it has even been encouraged by the World Health Organization when there is no other option. Because burning waste is rarely paid attention to, its effects go unnoticed. The release of hazardous materials and CO2 when waste is burned is the largest hazard with incineration.

==Financial models==
In most developed countries, domestic waste disposal is funded from a national or local tax which may be related to income, or property values. Commercial and industrial waste disposal is typically charged for as a commercial service, often as an integrated charge which includes disposal costs. This practice may encourage disposal contractors to opt for the cheapest disposal option such as landfill rather than the environmentally best solution such as re-use and recycling.

Financing solid waste management projects can be overwhelming for the city government, especially if the government see it as an important service they should render to the citizen. Donors and grants are a funding mechanism that is dependent on the interest of the donor organization. As much as it is a good way to develop a city&#x27;s waste management infrastructure, attracting and utilizing grants is solely reliant on what the donor considers important. Therefore, it may be a challenge for a city government to dictate how the funds should be distributed among the various aspect of waste management.

An example of a country that enforces a waste tax is Italy. The tax is based on two rates: fixed and variable. The fixed rate is based on the size of the house while the variable is determined by the number of people living in the house.

The World Bank finances and advises on solid waste management projects using a diverse suite of products and services, including traditional loans, results-based financing, development policy financing, and technical advisory. World Bank-financed waste management projects usually address the entire lifecycle of waste right from the point of generation to collection and transportation, and finally treatment and disposal.

==Disposal methods==

===Landfill===

===Incineration===
Incineration is a disposal method in which solid organic wastes are subjected to combustion so as to convert them into residue and gaseous products. This method is useful for the disposal of both municipal solid waste and solid residue from wastewater treatment. This process reduces the volume of solid waste by 80 to 95 percent. Incineration and other high-temperature waste treatment systems are sometimes described as &quot;thermal treatment&quot;. Incinerators convert waste materials into heat, gas, steam, and ash.

Incineration is carried out both on a small scale by individuals and on a large scale by industry. It is used to dispose of solid, liquid, and gaseous waste. It is recognized as a practical method of disposing of certain hazardous waste materials (such as biological medical waste). Incineration is a controversial method of waste disposal, due to issues such as the emission of gaseous pollutants including substantial quantities of carbon dioxide.

Incineration is common in countries such as Japan where land is more scarce, as the facilities generally do not require as much area as landfills. Waste-to-energy (WtE) or energy-from-waste (EfW) are broad terms for facilities that burn waste in a furnace or boiler to generate heat, steam, or electricity. Combustion in an incinerator is not always perfect and there have been concerns about pollutants in gaseous emissions from incinerator stacks. Particular concern has focused on some very persistent organic compounds such as dioxins, furans, and PAHs, which may be created and which may have serious environmental consequences and some heavy metals such as mercury and lead which can be volatilised in the combustion process..

==Recycling==
Recycling is a resource recovery practice that refers to the collection and reuse of waste materials such as empty beverage containers. This process involves breaking down and reusing materials that would otherwise be gotten rid of as trash. There are numerous benefits of recycling, and with so many new technologies making even more materials recyclable, it is possible to clean up the Earth. Recycling not only benefits the environment but also positively affects the economy. The materials from which the items are made can be made into new products. Materials for recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins and collection vehicles, a procedure called kerbside collection. In some communities, the owner of the waste is required to separate the materials into different bins (e.g. for paper, plastics, metals) prior to its collection. In other communities, all recyclable materials are placed in a single bin for collection, and the sorting is handled later at a central facility. The latter method is known as &quot;single-stream recycling&quot;.
The most common consumer products recycled include aluminium such as beverage cans, copper such as wire, steel from food and aerosol cans, old steel furnishings or equipment, rubber tyres, polyethylene and PET bottles, glass bottles and jars, paperboard cartons, newspapers, magazines and light paper, and corrugated fiberboard boxes.

PVC, LDPE, PP, and PS (see resin identification code) are also recyclable. These items are usually composed of a single type of material, making them relatively easy to recycle into new products. The recycling of complex products (such as computers and electronic equipment) is more difficult, due to the additional dismantling and separation required.

The type of material accepted for recycling varies by city and country. Each city and country has different recycling programs in place that can handle the various types of recyclable materials. However, certain variation in acceptance is reflected in the resale value of the material once it is reprocessed. Some of the types of recycling include waste paper and cardboard, plastic recycling, metal recycling, electronic devices, wood recycling, glass recycling, cloth and textile and so many more. In July 2017, the Chinese government announced an import ban of 24 categories of recyclables and solid waste, including plastic, textiles and mixed paper, placing tremendous impact on developed countries globally, which exported directly or indirectly to China.

==Re-use==

===Biological reprocessing===
Recoverable materials that are organic in nature, such as plant material, food scraps, and paper products, can be recovered through composting and digestion processes to decompose the organic matter. The resulting organic material is then recycled as mulch or compost for agricultural or landscaping purposes. In addition, waste gas from the process (such as methane) can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat (CHP/cogeneration) maximising efficiencies. There are different types of composting and digestion methods and technologies. They vary in complexity from simple home compost heaps to large-scale industrial digestion of mixed domestic waste. The different methods of biological decomposition are classified as aerobic or anaerobic methods. Some methods use the hybrids of these two methods. The anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction of solid waste is more environmentally effective than landfill, or incineration. The intention of biological processing in waste management is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter. (See resource recovery).

===Energy recovery===

Energy recovery from waste is the conversion of non-recyclable waste materials into usable heat, electricity, or fuel through a variety of processes, including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, anaerobic digestion, and landfill gas recovery. This process is often called waste-to-energy. Energy recovery from waste is part of the non-hazardous waste management hierarchy. Using energy recovery to convert non-recyclable waste materials into electricity and heat, generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce methane generation from landfills. Globally, waste-to-energy accounts for 16% of waste management.

The energy content of waste products can be harnessed directly by using them as a direct combustion fuel, or indirectly by processing them into another type of fuel. Thermal treatment ranges from using waste as a fuel source for cooking or heating and the use of the gas fuel (see above), to fuel for boilers to generate steam and electricity in a turbine. Pyrolysis and gasification are two related forms of thermal treatment where waste materials are heated to high temperatures with limited oxygen availability. The process usually occurs in a sealed vessel under high pressure. Pyrolysis of solid waste converts the material into solid, liquid, and gas products. The liquid and gas can be burnt to produce energy or refined into other chemical products (chemical refinery). The solid residue (char) can be further refined into products such as activated carbon. Gasification and advanced Plasma arc gasification are used to convert organic materials directly into a synthetic gas (syngas) composed of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The gas is then burnt to produce electricity and steam.
An alternative to pyrolysis is high-temperature and pressure supercritical water decomposition (hydrothermal monophasic oxidation).

===Pyrolysis===

Pyrolysis is often used to convert many types of domestic and industrial residues into a recovered fuel. Different types of waste input (such as plant waste, food waste, tyres) placed in the pyrolysis process potentially yield an alternative to fossil fuels. Pyrolysis is a process of thermo-chemical decomposition of organic materials by heat in the absence of stoichiometric quantities of oxygen; the decomposition produces various hydrocarbon gases. During pyrolysis, the molecules of an object vibrate at high frequencies to the extent that molecules start breaking down. The rate of pyrolysis increases with temperature. In industrial applications, temperatures are above 430 °C (800 °F).

Slow pyrolysis produces gases and solid charcoal. Pyrolysis holds promise for conversion of waste biomass into useful liquid fuel. Pyrolysis of waste wood and plastics can potentially produce fuel. The solids left from pyrolysis contain metals, glass, sand, and pyrolysis coke which does not convert to gas. Compared to the process of incineration, certain types of pyrolysis processes release less harmful by-products that contain alkali metals, sulphur, and chlorine. However, pyrolysis of some waste yields gases which impact the environment such as HCl and SO2.

===Resource recovery===

Resource recovery is the systematic diversion of waste, which was intended for disposal, for a specific next use. It is the processing of recyclables to extract or recover materials and resources, or convert to energy. These activities are performed at a resource recovery facility. Resource recovery is not only environmentally important, but it is also cost-effective. It decreases the amount of waste for disposal, saves space in landfills, and conserves natural resources.

Resource recovery, an alternative approach to traditional waste management, utilizes life cycle analysis (LCA) to evaluate and optimize waste handling strategies. Comprehensive studies focusing on mixed municipal solid waste (MSW) have identified a preferred pathway for maximizing resource efficiency and minimizing environmental impact, including effective waste administration and management, source separation of waste materials, efficient collection systems, reuse and recycling of non-organic fractions, and processing of organic material through anaerobic digestion.

As an example of how resource recycling can be beneficial, many items thrown away contain metals that can be recycled to create a profit, such as the components in circuit boards. Wood chippings in pallets and other packaging materials can be recycled into useful products for horticulture. The recycled chips can cover paths, walkways, or arena surfaces.

Application of rational and consistent waste management practices can yield a range of benefits including:
# Economic – Improving economic efficiency through the means of resource use, treatment, and disposal and creating markets for recycles can lead to efficient practices in the production and consumption of products and materials resulting in valuable materials being recovered for reuse and the potential for new jobs and new business opportunities.
# Social – By reducing adverse impacts on health through proper waste management practices, the resulting consequences are more appealing to civic communities. Better social advantages can lead to new sources of employment and potentially lift communities out of poverty, especially in some of the developing poorer countries and cities.
# Environmental – Reducing or eliminating adverse impacts on the environment through reducing, reusing, recycling, and minimizing resource extraction can result in improved air and water quality and help in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
# Inter-generational Equity – Following effective waste management practices can provide subsequent generations a more robust economy, a fairer and more inclusive society and a cleaner environment.

=== Waste valorization ===
==Liquid waste-management==
Liquid waste is an important category of waste management because it is so difficult to deal with. Unlike solid wastes, liquid wastes cannot be easily picked up and removed from an environment. Liquid wastes spread out, and easily pollute other sources of liquid if brought into contact. This type of waste also soaks into objects like soil and groundwater. This in turn carries over to pollute the plants, the animals in the ecosystem, as well as the humans within the area of the pollution.

=== Industrial wastewater ===
===Sewage sludge treatment ===
==Avoidance and reduction methods==

An important method of waste management is the prevention of waste material being created, also known as waste reduction. Waste Minimization is reducing the quantity of hazardous wastes achieved through a thorough application of innovative or alternative procedures. Methods of avoidance include reuse of second-hand products, repairing broken items instead of buying new ones, designing products to be refillable or reusable (such as cotton instead of plastic shopping bags), encouraging consumers to avoid using disposable products (such as disposable cutlery), removing any food/liquid remains from cans and packaging, and designing products that use less material to achieve the same purpose (for example, lightweighting of beverage cans).

==International waste trade==
==Challenges in developing countries==
Areas with developing economies often experience exhausted waste collection services and inadequately managed and uncontrolled dumpsites. The problems are worsening. Problems with governance complicate the situation. Waste management in these countries and cities is an ongoing challenge due to weak institutions, chronic under-resourcing, and rapid urbanization. All of these challenges, along with the lack of understanding of different factors that contribute to the hierarchy of waste management, affect the treatment of waste.

In developing countries, waste management activities are usually carried out by the poor, for their survival. It has been estimated that 2% of the population in Asia, Latin America, and Africa are dependent on waste for their livelihood. Family organized, or individual manual scavengers are often involved with waste management practices with very little supportive network and facilities with increased risk of health effects. Additionally, this practice prevents their children from further education. The participation level of most citizens in waste management is very low, residents in urban areas are not actively involved in the process of waste management.

==Technologies==

Traditionally, the waste management industry has been a late adopter of new technologies such as RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags, GPS and integrated software packages which enable better quality data to be collected without the use of estimation or manual data entry. This technology has been used widely by many organizations in some industrialized countries. Radiofrequency identification is a tagging system for automatic identification of recyclable components of municipal solid waste streams.

Smart waste management has been implemented in several cities, including San Francisco, Varde or Madrid. Waste containers are equipped with level sensors. When the container is almost full, the sensor warns the pickup truck, which can thus trace its route servicing the fullest containers and skipping the emptiest ones.

== Statistics and trends ==
The &quot;Global Waste Management Outlook 2024,&quot; supported by the Environment Fund - UNEP’s core financial fund, and jointly published with the International Solid Waste Association (ISWA), provides a comprehensive update on the trajectory of global waste generation and the escalating costs of waste management since 2018. The report predicts municipal solid waste to rise from 2.3 billion tonnes in 2023 to 3.8 billion tonnes by 2050. The direct global cost of waste management was around USD 252 billion in 2020, which could soar to USD 640.3 billion annually by 2050 if current practices continue without reform. Incorporating life cycle assessments, the report contrasts scenarios from maintaining the status quo to fully adopting zero waste and circular economy principles. It indicates that effective waste prevention and management could cap annual costs at USD 270.2 billion by 2050, while a circular economy approach could transform the sector into a net positive, offering a potential annual gain of USD 108.5 billion. To prevent the direst outcomes, the report calls for immediate action across multiple sectors, including development banks, governments, municipalities, producers, retailers, and citizens, providing targeted strategies for waste reduction and improved management practices.
== Waste management by region ==

===China===
Municipal solid waste generation shows spatiotemporal variation. In spatial distribution, the point sources in eastern coastal regions are quite different. Guangdong, Shanghai and Tianjin produced MSW of 30.35, 7.85 and 2.95 Mt, respectively. In temporal distribution, during 2009–2018, Fujian province showed a 123% increase in MSW generation while Liaoning province showed only 7% increase, whereas Shanghai special zone had a decline of −11% after 2013. MSW composition characteristics are complicated. The major components such as kitchen waste, paper and rubber &amp; plastics in different eastern coastal cities have fluctuation in the range of 52.8–65.3%, 3.5–11.9%, and 9.9–19.1%, respectively. Treatment rate of consumption waste is up to 99% with a sum of 52% landfill, 45% incineration, and 3% composting technologies, indicating that landfill still dominates MSW treatment.

=== Hungary ===
Hungary&#x27;s first waste prevention program was their 2014-2020 national waste management plan. Their current program (2021-2027) is financed by European Union and international grants, domestic co-financing, product charges, and landfill taxes.

===Morocco===
Morocco has seen benefits from implementing a $300 million sanitary landfill system. While it might appear to be a costly investment, the country&#x27;s government predicts that it has saved them another $440 million in damages, or consequences of failing to dispose of waste properly.

===San Francisco===
San Francisco started to make changes to their waste management policies in 2009 with the expectation to be zero waste by 2030. Council made changes such as making recycling and composting a mandatory practice for businesses and individuals, banning Styrofoam and plastic bags, putting charges on paper bags, and increasing garbage collection rates. Businesses are fiscally rewarded for correct disposal of recycling and composting and taxed for incorrect disposal. Besides these policies, the waste bins were manufactured in various sizes. The compost bin is the largest, the recycling bin is second, and the garbage bin is the smallest. This encourages individuals to sort their waste thoughtfully with respect to the sizes. These systems are working because they were able to divert 80% of waste from the landfill, which is the highest rate of any major U.S. city. Despite all these changes, Debbie Raphael, director of the San Francisco Department of the Environment, states that zero waste is still not achievable until all products are designed differently to be able to be recycled or compostable.

===Turkey===
===United Kingdom===

Waste management policy in England is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). In England, the &quot;Waste Management Plan for England&quot; presents a compilation of waste management policies. In the devolved nations such as Scotland Waste management policy is a responsibility of their own respective departments.

===Zambia===
In Zambia, ASAZA is a community-based organization whose principal purpose is to complement the efforts of the Government and cooperating partners to uplift the standard of living for disadvantaged communities. The project&#x27;s main objective is to minimize the problem of indiscriminate littering which leads to land degradation and pollution of the environment. ASAZA is also at the same time helping alleviate the problems of unemployment and poverty through income generation and payment of participants, women, and unskilled youths.

== E-waste ==
A record 53.6 million metric tonnes (Mt) of electronic waste was generated worldwide in 2019, up 21 percent in just five years, according to the UN&#x27;s Global E-waste Monitor 2020, released today. The new report also predicts global e-waste – discarded products with a battery or plug – will reach 74 Mt by 2030, almost a doubling of e-waste in just 16 years. This makes e-waste the world&#x27;s fastest-growing domestic waste stream, fueled mainly by higher consumption rates of electric and electronic equipment, short life cycles, and few options for repair. Only 17.4 percent of 2019&#x27;s e-waste was collected and recycled. This means that gold, silver, copper, platinum, and other high-value, recoverable materials conservatively valued at US$57 billion – a sum greater than the Gross Domestic Product of most countries – were mostly dumped or burned rather than being collected for treatment and reuse. E-wasteis predicted to double by 2050.

=== Transboundary movement of e-waste ===
The Transboundary E-waste Flows Monitor quantified that 5.1 Mt (just below 10 percent of the total amount of global e-waste, 53.6 Mt) crossed country borders in 2019. To better understand the implication of transboundary movement, this study categorizes the transboundary movement of e-waste into controlled and uncontrolled movements and also considers both the receiving and sending regions.

<text>In anatomy, a fistula (: fistulas or fistulae ; from Latin &quot;fistula&quot;, &quot;tube, pipe&quot;) is an abnormal connection (i.e. tube) joining two hollow spaces (technically, two epithelialized surfaces), such as blood vessels, intestines, or other hollow organs to each other, often resulting in an abnormal flow of fluid from one space to the other. An anal fistula connects the anal canal to the perianal skin. An anovaginal or rectovaginal fistula is a hole joining the anus or rectum to the vagina. A colovaginal fistula joins the space in the colon to that in the vagina. A urinary tract fistula is an abnormal opening in the urinary tract or an abnormal connection between the urinary tract and another organ. An abnormal communication (i.e. hole or tube) between the bladder and the uterus is called a vesicouterine fistula, while if it is between the bladder and the vagina it is known as a vesicovaginal fistula, and if between the urethra and the vagina: a urethrovaginal fistula. When occurring between two parts of the intestine, it is known as an enteroenteral fistula, between the small intestine and the skin it is known as an enterocutaneous fistula, and between the colon and the skin as a colocutaneous fistula.
A fistula can result from an infection, inflammation, injury or surgery. Many result from complications during childbirth. Sometimes a fistula is deliberately surgically created as part of a treatment, for example in the case of an arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis.
The treatment for a fistula varies depending on the type, cause, and severity of the fistula, but often involves surgical intervention combined with antibiotic therapy. In some cases the fistula is temporarily covered using a fibrin glue or plug. A catheter may be required to drain a fistula.
Globally, every year between 50,000 and 100,000 women are affected by one or more fistulas relating to childbirth. Typically they are vaginal fistulas, between either the bowel or bladder and the vaginal canal, but uterine and bowel fistulas also occur.

In botany, the term is most common in its adjectival forms, where it is used in binomial names to refer to a species that is distinguished by one or more hollow or tubular structures. &quot;Monarda fistulosa&quot;, for example, has tubular flowers.

The term was first used in the 14th century.

==Definition==
A fistula is an abnormal connection between vessels or organs that do not usually connect. It can be due to a disease or trauma, or purposely surgically created.

==Classification==
Various types of fistulas include:
* Blind: Only one open end; may also be called sinus tracts.
* Complete: Both internal and external openings.
* Incomplete: An external skin opening that does not connect to any internal organ.

Although most fistulas are in forms of a tube, some can also have multiple branches.

===Location===
Types of fistula can be described by their location. Anal fistulas connect between the epithelialized surface of the anal canal and the perianal skin. Anovaginal or rectovaginal fistulas occur when a hole develops between the anus or rectum and the vagina. Colovaginal fistulas occur between the colon and the vagina. Urinary tract fistulas are abnormal openings within the urinary tract or an abnormal connection between the urinary tract and another organ such as between the bladder and the uterus in a vesicouterine fistula, between the bladder and the vagina in a vesicovaginal fistula, and between the urethra and the vagina in urethrovaginal fistula. When occurring between two parts of the intestine, it is known as an enteroenteral fistula, between the small intestine and the skin as an enterocutaneous fistula, and between the small intestine and the colon as a colocutaneous fistula.

==Causes==
* Disease: Infections including an anorectal abscess and inflammatory diseases including Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis can result in fistulas. Fistulas to the anus may occur in hidradenitis suppurativa. In women, fistulas can also occur following pelvic infection and inflammation.

* Surgical and medical treatment: Complications from gallbladder surgery can lead to biliary fistulas. As well as being congenital or resulting from trauma, arteriovenous fistulas are created purposefully for hemodialysis. Radiation therapy to the pelvis can lead to vesicovaginal fistulas. Persistent gastrocutaneous fistulas can develop after gastrostomy.
* Trauma: Prolonged childbirth can lead to fistulas in women, in whom abnormal connections may occur between the bladder and vagina, or the rectum and vagina. An obstetric fistula develops when blood supply to the tissues of the vagina and the bladder (and/or rectum) is cut off during prolonged obstructed labor. The tissues die and a hole forms through which urine and/or feces pass uncontrollably. Vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulas may also be caused by rape, in particular gang rape, and rape with foreign objects, as evidenced by the abnormally high number of women in conflict areas who have developed fistulae. In 2003, thousands of women in eastern Congo presented themselves for treatment of traumatic fistulas caused by systematic, violent gang rape, often also with sharp objects that occurred during the country&#x27;s five years of war. So many cases have been reported that the destruction of the vagina is considered a war injury and recorded by doctors as a crime of combat. Head trauma can lead to perilymph fistulas, whereas trauma to other parts of the body can cause arteriovenous fistulas.

== Treatment ==

Treatment for fistula varies depending on the cause and extent of the fistula, but often involves surgical intervention combined with antibiotic therapy. In some cases the fistula is temporarily covered, using a fibrin glue or plug. Catheters may be required to drain a fistula.

Surgery is often required to assure adequate drainage of the fistula (so that pus may escape without forming an abscess). Various surgical procedures are used, most commonly fistulotomy, placement of a seton (a cord that is passed through the path of the fistula to keep it open for draining), or an endorectal flap procedure (where healthy tissue is pulled over the internal side of the fistula to keep feces or other material from reinfecting the channel).

Management involves treating any underlying causative condition. For example, surgical treatment of fistulae in Crohn&#x27;s disease can be effective, but if the Crohn&#x27;s disease itself is not treated, the rate of recurrence of the fistula is very high (well above 50%).

== Therapeutic use ==
In people with kidney failure, requiring dialysis, a cimino fistula is often deliberately created in the arm by means of a short day surgery in order to permit easier withdrawal of blood for hemodialysis.

As a radical treatment for portal hypertension, surgical creation of a portacaval fistula produces an anastomosis between the hepatic portal vein and the inferior vena cava across the omental foramen (of Winslow). This spares the portal venous system from high pressure which can cause esophageal varices, caput medusae, and hemorrhoids.

==Epidemiology==
Globally, every year between 50,000 and 100,000 women are affected by fistula relating to childbirth.

==Botany==
In botany, the term is most common in its adjectival forms, where it is used in binomial names to refer to species that are distinguished by hollow or tubular structures. &quot;Monarda fistulosa&quot;, for example, has tubular flowers; &quot;Eutrochium fistulosum&quot; has a tubular stem; &quot;Allium fistulosum&quot; has hollow or tubular leaves, and &quot;Acacia seyal&quot; subsp. &quot;fistula&quot; is the subspecies with hollow spines.

== Society and culture ==
The term was first used in the 14th century.

A fistula plays a central role in William Shakespeares play All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well

<text>Whey is the liquid remaining after milk has been curdled and strained. It is a byproduct of the manufacturing of cheese or casein and has several commercial uses. Sweet whey is a byproduct resulting from the manufacture of rennet types of hard cheese, like cheddar or Swiss cheese. Acid whey (also known as sour whey) is a byproduct brought out during the making of acid types of dairy products, such as strained yogurt.

Whey proteins consist of β-lactoglobulin (48%–58%), α-lactalbumin (13%–19%), Glycomacropeptide (12%–20%), bovine serum albumin, heavy and light chain immunoglobulins and several minor whey proteins.

== Composition ==
Sweet whey and acid whey are similar in gross nutritional analysis. By mass both contain 93% water, about 0.8% protein, and about 5.1% carbohydrates. Sweet whey contains about 0.4% fat while sour whey contains about 0.1% fat. The carbohydrates are mainly lactose. The proteins are known as lactalbumin. Whey also contains some minerals.

== Production ==
To produce cheese, rennet or an edible acid is added to heated milk. This makes the milk coagulate or curdle, separating the milk solids (curds) from the liquid whey. Sweet whey is the byproduct of rennet-coagulated cheese, and acid whey (also called sour whey) is the byproduct of acid-coagulated cheese. Sweet whey has a pH greater than or equal to 5.6; acid whey has a pH less than or equal to 5.1.

=== Further processing ===
The fat from whey is removed and then processed for human foods (see whey butter). Processing can be done by simple drying, or the relative protein content can be increased by removing lipids and other non-protein materials. For example, spray drying after membrane filtration separates the proteins from whey.

Heat 
denatures whey proteins, causing them to coagulate into a protein gel that may be useful in some foods. Sustained high temperatures above 72 °C can denature whey proteins. Heat-denatured whey can still cause allergies in some people.

== Uses ==
Whey is used to produce whey cheeses such as ricotta, Norwegian brunost, and whey butter and many other products for human consumption. The fat content of whey is low; for example 1,000 pounds of whey are required to make a few pounds of whey butter. It is also an additive in many processed foods, including breads, crackers, and commercial pastry, and in animal feed. Whey proteins consist primarily of α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin. Sweet whey contains glycomacropeptide (GMP). It is also an abundant source of lactose which can further be used for the synthesis of lactose-based bioactive molecules.

Dairy whey remaining from home-made cheesemaking has many uses. It is a dough conditioner and can be substituted for skimmed milk in most baked good recipes that require milk (bread, pancakes, muffins, etc.).

Throughout history, whey was a popular drink in inns and coffee houses. When Joseph Priestley was at college at Daventry Academy, 1752–1755, he records that, on the morning of Wednesday, 22 May 1754, he &quot;went with a large company to drink whey.&quot; This was probably &quot;sack whey&quot; or &quot;wine whey&quot;.

Whey is also one of the main ingredients of Rivella, a carbonated drink in Switzerland.

Another use of whey is to make &quot;cream of tartar whey&quot;: &quot;Put a pint of blue milk [skim milk] over the fire, when it begins to boil, put in two tea spoonfuls of cream of tartar, then take it off the fire, and let it stand till the curd settles to the bottom of the pan, then put it into a basin to cool, and drink it milk warm.&quot; This is known as heat-acid coagulation.

In areas where cheese is made, excess whey byproduct is sometimes sprayed over hay fields as a fertilizer.

Historically whey, being a byproduct of cheese making, was considered a waste product and was pumped into rivers and streams in the U.S. Since the whey contained protein, this practice led to the growth of large concentrations of algae. These were deemed to be a hazard to the ecosystem because they prevented sunlight and oxygen from reaching the water. The government eventually prohibited this practice which led to a disposal problem for producers of other dairy products. Their first solution was to use it as a cheap filler in the production of ice cream. Whey eventually found its way into innumerable other products as a filler and ultimately into a number of health food products where it remains a popular supplement.

=== Whey protein ===
Whey protein is commonly marketed as a dietary supplement, and various health claims have been attributed to it in the alternative medicine community. Although whey proteins are responsible for some milk allergies, the major allergens in milk are the caseins.

Whey is the primary ingredient in most protein powders, which are used primarily by athletes and bodybuilders to obtain the necessary amounts of protein for muscle building/maintenance on a daily basis. Whey protein has a high level of leucine, one of the three branched-chain amino acids, making it ideal for muscle growth and repair. Whey is pasteurized to assure that no harmful bacteria are breeding in the liquid. It is heated to and is then cooled back down to . Studies have shown that this process of using extreme temperatures eliminates 99.7% of bacteria without coagulating the protein into a solid mass. Next, the whey must be filtered, and so is loaded into a massive web of ceramic filters and stainless steel turbines. These machines work to separate out the lactose as well as the fats, leaving a liquid of 90% whey protein.

Hydrolysates are whey proteins that are predigested and partially hydrolyzed for the purpose of easier metabolizing, but their cost is generally higher. Highly hydrolysed whey may be less allergenic than other forms of whey, due to the fact that the short chain peptides obtained by hydrolysis are less antigenic, because of the elimination of sequential epitopes.

Native whey protein is extracted from skim milk, not obtained as a byproduct of cheese production, and is produced as a concentrate and isolate.

===Whey cream and butter===

Cream can be skimmed from whey. Whey cream is saltier, tangier, and &quot;cheesier&quot; than (&quot;sweet&quot;) cream skimmed from milk, and can be used to make whey butter. Due to the low fat content of whey the yield is not high, with typically two to five parts of butter manufactured from the whey of 1,000 parts milk. Whey cream and butter are suitable for making butter-flavoured food, as they have a stronger flavour of their own. They are also cheaper to manufacture than sweet cream and butter.

==Health==
Liquid whey contains lactose, vitamins, protein, and minerals, along with traces of fat.

In 2005 researchers at Lund University in Sweden found that whey can help regulate and reduce spikes in blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes by increasing insulin secretion.

Dairy products produce higher insulin responses (Insulin index, II, 90–98) than expected from their comparatively low glycemic indices (GI 15–30). Insulinogenic effects from dairy products have been observed in healthy subjects, both when ingested as a single meal, and when included into a mixed meal. The insulin-releasing capacity of dairy products has been attributed to the protein fraction, particularly the whey fraction, and the subsequent release of amino acids during digestion has been proposed to underlie the insulinogenic properties of milk.

As whey contains lactose, it should be avoided by lactose intolerant individuals. When used as a food additive, whey can contribute to quantities of lactose far above the level of tolerance of most lactose-intolerant individuals. Additionally, people can be allergic to whey or other milk proteins, but as whey proteins are altered by high temperatures, whey-sensitive individuals may be able to tolerate evaporated, boiled, or sterilized milk. Hard cheeses are high in casein, but low in whey proteins, and are the least allergenic for those allergic to whey proteins. However, casein proteins (which are heat-stable) are the most important allergens in cheese, and an individual may be allergic to either or both types of protein.

=== Unsupported health claims ===
In 2010 a panel of the European Food Safety Authority examined health claims made for whey protein. For the following claims either no references were provided for the claimed effect or the provided studies did not test the claims, or reported conflicting results:
* Increase in satiety leading to a reduction in energy intake
* Contribution to the maintenance or achievement of a normal body weight
* Growth or maintenance of muscle mass (compared to other protein sources)
* Increase in lean body mass during energy restriction and resistance training (compared to other protein sources)
* Reduction of body fat mass during energy restriction and resistance training (compared to other protein sources)
* Increase in muscle strength (compared to other protein sources)
* Increase in endurance capacity during the subsequent exercise bout after strenuous exercise
* Skeletal muscle tissue repair (compared to other protein sources)
* Faster recovery from muscle fatigue after exercise (compared to other protein sources).
For the studies around muscle mass and strength whey protein was compared to other protein sources. This is important to note, since protein is necessary for building muscles and this study proved that whey protein is not better for building strength and size than other protein sources.

On the basis of the data presented, the 2010 panel concluded that a cause and effect relationship between the consumption of whey protein and these claims had not been established.

<doc id="210565" wikidata="Q481487" url="?curid=210565" title="Ton Steine Scherben">
<text>Ton Steine Scherben () was one of the first and most influential German language rock bands of the 1970s and early 1980s. Well known for the highly political and emotional lyrics of vocalist Rio Reiser, they became a musical mouthpiece of new left movements, such as the squatting movement, during that time in Germany and their hometown of West Berlin in particular. Today, after the band&#x27;s demise in 1985, and the death of Rio Reiser in 1996, Ton Steine Scherben have retained a cult following and popularity in the related scenes.
Recently, some of the remaining members have given reunion concerts.

==Etymology==

Ton Steine Scherben&#x27;s literal English translation is &quot;Clay Stones Shards&quot;; in German, &quot;Ton&quot; can mean &quot;sound&quot; as well, so the band&#x27;s name may be considered to be an amphibology. Singer Rio Reiser usually told journalists the name was taken from a description by pioneer archeologist Heinrich Schliemann of what he saw when he first came to the site of ancient Troy. Other members of the band claim in the biography &quot;Keine Macht für Niemand - Die Geschichte der Ton Steine Scherben&quot; (&quot;No power for nobody - the story of Ton Steine Scherben&quot;) that it is a play on the name of the West German labor union Bau-Steine-Erden (Construction-Stone-Earth).
The band name is also a tribute to The Rolling Stones and to &quot;Die roten Steine&quot; (The red stones), a trainee theatre group from Berlin.

==History==
Formed in 1970 by vocalist and guitarist Rio Reiser (his legal name was Ralph Christian Möbius), guitarist R. P. S. Lanrue (legally named Ralph Peter Steitz), Kai Sichtermann| on bass guitar, and drummer Wolfgang Seidel when the members were all around 20 years of age. They are nowadays considered to have been one of the first genuine German-language rock bands; coming into being after &quot;Ihre Kinder&quot; from Nuremberg, but well before Udo Lindenberg&#x27;s Panikorchester, the first widely successful, mainstream German language rock act. Their first big-stage appearance was at an Open-Air on 6 September 1970 on the Fehmarn stage where Jimi Hendrix had had his last appearance directly before. A house right next to the stage went up in flames while they were still playing; it has been alleged that it had been set on fire by the security personnel who had just received news that the event&#x27;s organizers had disappeared with all the revenues. Still many people believed that Ton Steine Scherben had set the stage on fire, which gave them tremendous credibility in the radical scene.

Die Scherben released their material through their own label. The &quot;David Volksmund Produktion&quot; (David from &quot;David and Goliath&quot;; Volksmund = the people&#x27;s voice) released not only the LPs of the Scherben but also of &quot;Caramboulage&quot;, an all-female rock group which consisted of Angie Olbrich, Elfie-Esther Steitz-Praeker (R. P. S.&#x27;s sister) and Britta Neander (died in 2005); also they were engaged in the German gay-movement, so they released two LPs of &quot;Brühwarm&quot; and a band namend &quot;Stricher&quot; [&quot;hustler&quot; or &quot;the moneyboys&quot;]; the last record of the David-Volksmund-Produktion is the LP &quot;Sternschnuppen&quot; of the singer-songwriter Misha Schoeneberg. In 2003 DVP was brought back to life.

In the middle of the 1970s the pressure on the Scherben from their anarchistic fanbase grew. The Band felt more and more like a &quot;music-box&quot;, playing for the radical scene on cue. While the band attempted a shift toward more personal lyrics, the radical scene insisted that they remain as political as before. Under this pressure the band escaped from Berlin to , a little town in Nordfriesland, where they bought an old farm, which the numerous bandmembers, about 16 in all, repaired. There they tried to make their dream of &quot;working &amp; living together&quot; come true.

After a period of being managed by Claudia Roth (later to become co-chairwoman of the German Green Party), they disbanded in 1985 when the band&#x27;s debt became unbearable and because they thought that everything that could be said was said.

Singer Rio Reiser then embarked on a solo career until his death in 1996. At that time the rest of &quot;Ton Steine Scherben&quot; reunited one more time for a farewell concert.

In 2014, 29 years after the split the band reunited and went on tour in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. R. P. S. Lanrue died on 14 July 2024 of cancer age 74.

==Musical traits, lyrical themes and influence==
Ton Steine Scherben were pioneers in German music culture. Their style has been described as rock with a &quot;renegade stance, what in later years would be dubbed &#x27;punk&#x27;.&quot;

Their lyrics were at the beginning anti-capitalist and anarchist. They did not think the socialism of the Soviet Union was anywhere near real socialism, and had connections to the squatter scene (e.g. Rauch-Haus-Song) and the German Red Army Faction during the time before the latter turned to direct guerrilla actions. Later Ton Steine Scherben toned down on political issues and explored more personal themes like freedom, love, drugs, and sadness. They also contributed to two full-length concept albums about homosexuality which were issued under the name &quot;Brühwarm&quot; (literally: boiling warm) in cooperation with a gay-revue group.

All their albums were self-published and promoted. Revenues from the albums were slim and the band was often expected by other leftists to give free &quot;solidarity concerts&quot; at political events, both of which contributed to the band&#x27;s perpetually poor financial situation and its eventual dissolution. Only few singles were released, which rarely received commercial attention. The Scherben were also on so called &quot;black lists&quot; due to their perceived left extremism, and were thus not played on Germany&#x27;s public radio stations of the time (private radio was only legalized in Germany in the late 1980s, after the band&#x27;s dissolution).

The gay rights activist and avant-garde director Rosa von Praunheim repeatedly gave Rio Reiser artistic suggestions.

<text>Joe Hill (October 7, 1879 – November 19, 1915), born Joel Emmanuel Hägglund and also known as Joseph Hillström, was a Swedish-American labor activist, songwriter, and member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, familiarly called the &quot;Wobblies&quot;). A native Swedish speaker, he learned English during the early 1900s, while working various jobs from New York to San Francisco. Hill, an immigrant worker frequently facing unemployment and underemployment, became a popular songwriter and cartoonist for the union. His songs include &quot;The Preacher and the Slave&quot; (in which he coined the phrase &quot;&quot;), &quot;The Tramp&quot;, &quot;There Is Power in a Union&quot;, &quot;The Rebel Girl&quot;, and &quot;Casey Jones—the Union Scab&quot;, which express the harsh and combative life of itinerant workers, and call for workers to organize their efforts to improve working conditions.

In 1914, John G. Morrison, a Salt Lake City area grocer and former policeman, and his son were shot and killed by two men. The same evening, Hill arrived at a doctor&#x27;s office with a gunshot wound, and briefly mentioned a fight over a woman. He refused to explain further, even after he was accused of the grocery store murders on the basis of his injury. Hill was convicted of the murders in a controversial trial. Following an unsuccessful appeal, political debates, and international calls for clemency from high-profile figures and workers&#x27; organizations, Hill was executed in November 1915. After his death, he was memorialized by several folk songs. His life and death have inspired books and poetry.

The identity of the woman and the rival who supposedly caused Hill&#x27;s injury, though frequently speculated upon, remained mostly conjecture for nearly a century. William M. Adler&#x27;s 2011 biography of Hill presents information about a possible alibi, which was never introduced at the trial. According to Adler, Hill and his friend and countryman Otto Appelquist were rivals for the attention of 20-year-old Hilda Erickson, a member of the family with whom the two men were lodging. In a recently discovered letter, Erickson confirmed her relationship with the two men and the rivalry between them. The letter indicates that when she first discovered Hill was injured, he explained to her that Appelquist had shot him, apparently out of jealousy.

==Early life==
Joel Emmanuel Hägglund was born 1879 in Gävle (then spelled Gefle), a city in the province of Gästrikland, Sweden. He was the third child in a family of nine, where three children died young. His father, Olof, worked as a conductor on the Gefle-Dala railway line. Olof (1846–1887) died at the age of 41, and his death meant economic disaster for the family. Joe&#x27;s mother Margareta Catharina (1844–1902) did, however, succeed in keeping the family together until she died when Joel was in his early twenties.

The Hägglund family home still stands in Gävle at the address Nedre Bergsgatan 28, in &quot;Gamla Stan&quot;, the Old Town. it houses a museum and the &quot;Joe Hill-gården&quot;, which hosts cultural events.

In his late teens-early twenties, Joel fell seriously ill with skin and glandular tuberculosis, and underwent extensive treatment in Stockholm. In October 1902, when nearly 23, Joel and his brother Paul Elias Hägglund (1877–1955) emigrated to the United States. Hill became an itinerant laborer, moving from New York City to Cleveland, and eventually to the west coast. He was in San Francisco at the time of the 1906 earthquake.

==IWW==

By this time using the name Joe or Joseph Hillstrom (possibly because of anti-union blacklisting), he joined the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) or Wobblies around 1910, when working on the docks in San Pedro, California. In late 1910 he wrote a letter to the IWW newspaper &quot;Industrial Worker&quot;, identifying himself as a member of the IWW local chapter in Portland, Oregon.

Hill rose in the IWW organization and traveled widely, organizing workers under the IWW banner, writing political songs and satirical poems, and making speeches. He and Harry McClintock were Spellbinders for the IWW and would show up as they did at the Tucker Utah strike on June 14, 1913 (Salt Lake Tribune). He shortened his pseudonym to &quot;Joe Hill&quot; as the pen-name under which his songs, cartoons and other writings appeared. His songs frequently appropriated familiar melodies from popular songs and hymns of the time. He coined the phrase &quot;&quot;, which appeared in his song &quot;The Preacher and the Slave&quot; (a parody of the hymn &quot;In the Sweet By-and-By&quot;). Other songs written by Hill include &quot;The Tramp&quot;, &quot;There Is Power in a Union&quot;, &quot;The Rebel Girl&quot;, and &quot;Casey Jones—the Union Scab&quot;.

==Trial==
As an itinerant worker, Hill moved around the west, hopping freight trains, going from job to job. By the end of 1913, he was working as a laborer at the Silver King Mine in Park City, Utah, not far from Salt Lake City.

On January 10, 1914, John G. Morrison and his son Arling were killed in their Salt Lake City grocery store by two armed intruders masked in red bandanas. The police first thought it was a crime of revenge, for nothing had been stolen and the elder Morrison had been a police officer, possibly creating many enemies. On the same evening, Hill appeared on the doorstep of a local doctor, with a bullet wound through the left lung. Hill said that he had been shot in an argument over a woman, whom he refused to name. The doctor reported that Hill was armed with a pistol. Considering Morrison&#x27;s past as a police officer, several men he had arrested were at first considered suspects; 12 people were arrested in the case before Hill was arrested and charged with the murder. A red bandana was found in Hill&#x27;s room. The pistol purported to be in Hill&#x27;s possession at the doctor&#x27;s office was not found. Hill resolutely denied that he was involved in the robbery and killing of Morrison. He said that when he was shot, his hands were over his head, and the bullet hole in his coat—four inches below the exit wound in his back—seemed to support this claim. Hill did not testify at his trial, but his lawyers pointed out that four other people were treated for bullet wounds in Salt Lake City that same night, and that the lack of robbery and Hill&#x27;s unfamiliarity with Morrison left him with no motive.

The prosecution, for its part, produced a dozen eyewitnesses who said that the killer resembled Hill, including 13-year-old Merlin Morrison, the victims&#x27; son, and a brother, who upon first seeing Hill said, &quot;That&#x27;s not him at all&quot; but later identified him as the murderer. The jury took just a few hours to find him guilty of murder.

An appeal to the Utah Supreme Court was unsuccessful. Orrin N. Hilton, the lawyer representing Hill during the appeal, declared: &quot;The main thing the state had on Hill was that he was a Wobbly and therefore sure to be guilty. Hill tried to keep the IWW out of [the trial] ... but the press fastened it upon him.&quot;

In a letter to the court, Hill continued to deny that the state had a right to inquire into the origins of his wound, leaving little doubt that the judges would affirm the conviction. Chief Justice Daniel Straup wrote that his unexplained wound was &quot;a distinguishing mark&quot;, and that &quot;the defendant may not avoid the natural and reasonable inferences of remaining silent.&quot; In an article for the socialist newspaper &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;, Hill wrote: &quot;Owing to the prominence of Mr. Morrison, there had to be a &#x27;goat&#x27; [scapegoat] and the undersigned being, as they thought, a friendless tramp, a Swede, and worst of all, an IWW, had no right to live anyway, and was therefore duly selected to be &#x27;the goat&#x27;.&quot;

The case turned into a major media event. President Woodrow Wilson, Helen Keller (the blind and deaf author and fellow-IWW member), the Swedish ambassador and the Swedish public all became involved in a bid for clemency. It generated international union attention, and critics charged that the trial and conviction were unfair. Despite the various petitions the governor at the time William Spry maintained Hill&#x27;s guilt. More recently, Utah Phillips considered Hill to have been a political prisoner who was executed for his political agitation through songwriting.

In a biography published in 2011, William M. Adler concludes that Hill was probably innocent of murder, but also suggests that Hill came to see himself as worth more to the labor movement as a martyr than he was alive, and that this understanding may have influenced his decisions not to testify at the trial and subsequently to spurn all chances of a pardon. Adler reports that evidence pointed to early police suspect Frank Z. Wilson, and cites Hilda Erickson&#x27;s letter, which states that Hill had told her he had been shot by her former fiancé.

==Execution==

Hill was executed by firing squad on November 19, 1915, at Utah&#x27;s Sugar House Prison. When Deputy Shettler, who led the firing squad, called out the sequence of commands preparatory to firing (&quot;Ready, aim,&quot;) Hill shouted, &quot;Fire—go on and fire!&quot;

That same day, a dynamite bomb was discovered at the Tarrytown estate of John D. Archbold, President of the Standard Oil Company. Police theorized the bomb was planted by anarchists and IWW radicals as a protest against Hill&#x27;s execution. The bomb was discovered by a gardener, who found four sticks of dynamite, weighing a pound each, half hidden in a rut in a driveway fifty feet from the front entrance of the residence. The dynamite sticks were bound together by a length of wire, fitted with percussion caps, and wrapped with a piece of paper matching the color of the driveway, a path used by Archbold in going to or from his home by automobile. The bomb was later defused by police.

Just prior to his execution, Hill had written to Bill Haywood, an IWW leader, saying, &quot;Goodbye Bill. I die like a true blue rebel. Don&#x27;t waste any time in mourning. Organize ... Could you arrange to have my body hauled to the state line to be buried? I don&#x27;t want to be found dead in Utah.&quot; Hunter S. Thompson asserted that Joe&#x27;s last words were &quot;Don&#x27;t mourn. Organize.&quot;

His last will, which was eventually set to music by Ethel Raim, founder of the group The Pennywhistlers, requested a cremation and reads:

==Aftermath==
Hill&#x27;s body was sent to Chicago, where it was cremated; in accordance with his wishes, his ashes were placed into 600 small envelopes and sent around the world to be released to the winds. Delegates attending the Tenth Convention of the IWW in Chicago received envelopes November 19, 1916, one year to the day of Hill&#x27;s execution (and not on May Day 1916 as Wobbly lore claims). The rest of the 600 envelopes were sent to IWW locals, Wobblies and sympathizers around the world on January 3, 1917.

In 1988, it was discovered that an envelope had been seized by the United States Post Office Department in 1917 because of its &quot;subversive potential&quot;. The envelope, with a photo affixed, captioned &quot;Joe Hill murdered by the capitalist class, Nov. 19, 1915&quot;, as well as its contents, was deposited at the National Archives. A story appeared in the United Auto Workers&#x27; magazine &quot;Solidarity&quot; and a small item followed it in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine. Members of the IWW in Chicago quickly laid claim to the contents of the envelope.

After some negotiations, the last of Hill&#x27;s ashes (but not the envelope that contained them) was turned over to the IWW in 1988. The weekly &quot;In These Times&quot; ran notice of the ashes and invited readers to suggest what should be done with them. Suggestions varied from enshrining them at the AFL–CIO headquarters in Washington, D.C., to Abbie Hoffman&#x27;s suggestion that they be eaten by today&#x27;s &quot;Joe Hills&quot; like Billy Bragg and Michelle Shocked. Bragg did indeed swallow a small bit of the ashes with some Union beer to wash it down, and for a time carried Shocked&#x27;s share for the eventual completion of Hoffman&#x27;s last prank. Bragg has since given Shocked&#x27;s share to Otis Gibbs. The majority of the ashes were cast to the wind in the US, Canada, Sweden, Australia, and Nicaragua. The ashes sent to Sweden were only partly cast to the wind. The main part was interred in the wall of a union office in Landskrona, a minor city in the south of the country, with a plaque commemorating Hill. That room is now the reading room of the local city library.

One small packet of ashes was scattered at a 1989 ceremony which unveiled a monument to six unarmed IWW coal miners buried in Lafayette, Colorado, who had been machine-gunned by Colorado state police in 1927 in the Columbine Mine massacre. Until 1989 the graves of five of these men were unmarked. Another Wobbly, Carlos Cortez, scattered Hill&#x27;s ashes on the graves at the commemoration.

On the night of November 18, 1990, the Southeast Michigan IWW General Membership Branch hosted a gathering of &quot;wobs&quot; in a remote wooded area at which a dinner, followed by a bonfire, featured a reading of Hill&#x27;s last will, &quot;and then his ashes were released into the flames and carried up above the trees. ... The next day ... one wob collected a bowl full of ashes from the smoldering fire pit.&quot; At that event several IWW members consumed a portion of Hill&#x27;s ashes before the rest was consigned to the fire.

To commemorate the 50th anniversary of Hill&#x27;s execution, Philip S. Foner published a book, &quot;The Case of Joe Hill&quot;, about the trial and subsequent events, which concludes that the case was a miscarriage of justice.

==Archival materials and legacy==

Hill&#x27;s handwritten last will and testament was uncovered in the first decade of the 21st century by archivist Michael Nash of the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives of New York University. Found in a box under a desk at the New York City headquarters of the Communist Party USA during a transfer of CPUSA archival materials to NYU, the document began with a couplet: &quot;My will is easy to decide / For I have nothing to divide.&quot;

Additional archival materials were donated to the Walter P. Reuther Library by Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden in 1976.

==Influence and tributes==

* Hill&#x27;s exhortation, &quot;Don&#x27;t waste any time mourning. Organize!&quot;, often shortened to &quot;Don&#x27;t mourn—organize!&quot;, has become a widely used slogan of the political Left, especially after a defeat or death.

<doc id="210569" wikidata="Q7185501" url="?curid=210569" title="Philippé Wynne">
<text>Philippé Wynne (&quot;aka&quot; Philippe Escalante Wynn; &quot;né&quot; Walker; April 3, 1941 – July 14, 1984) was an American singer, best known for his role as a lead vocalist of The Spinners (a role he shared with fellow group members Bobby Smith and Henry Fambrough). Wynne scored notable hits such as &quot;How Could I Let You Get Away&quot;, &quot;The Rubberband Man&quot;, and &quot;One of a Kind (Love Affair)&quot;. After leaving The Spinners, Wynne never regained the same success, although he was featured in hits by other artists such as &quot;(Not Just) Knee Deep&quot; by Funkadelic. Wynne died of a heart attack while performing at a nightclub.

==Life and career==
Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and raised in the New Orphanage Asylum for Colored Children in Cincinnati, Ohio, Wynne went to Detroit in the early 1960s and began his musical career with his brother Michael Walker as a gospel singer. He soon switched to R&amp;B and attained some measure of success, singing with Bootsy Collins &#x27;s Pacemakers in 1968. Wynne then spent time in Germany as the lead singer of the Afro Kings, a band from Liberia, before he replaced his cousin, G. C. Cameron, as one of the lead vocalists for The Spinners. He sang with the group until 1977, during which they achieved several successful albums and singles.

Wynne was one of three lead singers of the Spinners, but after several years with the group, he wanted the group&#x27;s name changed to Philippe Wynn and the Spinners. When this was denied, he left the group and launched a solo career, with Alan Thicke as his manager. Wynne also shifted his focus to the business end of the music industry, making a publishing group and record label. With Wynne&#x27;s departure, neither Wynne nor the Spinners would experience the level of success they had when they were together. Wynne&#x27;s first album &quot;Starting All Over&quot; was released on Cotillion Records in 1977 but had limited success and no hit singles. He was released from his Cotillion Records contract. He began working with George Clinton&#x27;s Parliament-Funkadelic in 1979. He performed with them on several recordings, and was a featured vocalist on the Funkadelic single &quot;(Not Just) Knee Deep&quot; (a No. 1 hit on the Billboard R&amp;B chart). While associated with Parliament-Funkadelic, Wynne also appeared on the Bootsy Collins album &quot;Sweat Band&quot;. Wynne released what would be his second solo album, &quot;Wynne Jammin&#x27;&quot;, in 1980 with Uncle Jam Records, a label fronted by George Clinton and Clinton&#x27;s manager Archie Ivy. However, the album was not a major seller. Wynne made a guest appearance on the song &quot;Something Inside My Head&quot; by Gene Dunlap, and in the song &quot;Whip It&quot; by the Treacherous Three. Wynne&#x27;s final album was the self-titled &quot;Philippé Wynne&quot;, released by Sugar Hill Records in 1984.

==Family==
His parents, DeGree Walker and Annie &quot;(née&quot; Wynn) divorced in November 1947 in Cincinnati, Ohio. Around 1952, Philippe and his three siblings – Annie Walker, who later became an opera singer, Michael Leon Walker, and Margaret Walker – were placed in the New Orphan Asylum for Colored Children (which closed in 1967), in the Avondale neighborhood of Cincinnati, on Van Buren Street. Their father, DeGree Walker, was granted custody after the divorce, although he worked as a contractor in construction and had to travel. Their mother, Annie, had run off to Detroit with another man.

Around 1956, Philippé and his brother, Michael, ran away from the orphanage and headed to Detroit, Michigan to find their mother. In Detroit, the two formed a gospel group called the Walker Singers. This lasted until Philippe adopted his mother&#x27;s surname, Wynn (initially without an &quot;e&quot;), and moved on to The Spinners as lead singer.

===Marriage and children===
Wynne married Ava Leflor on February 1, 1973, in Las Vegas, Nevada. They had two sons, Emmanuel Wynn (1974–2001) and Alvarez Escalante Wynn (1975–1999). He also has an older son by the name of Cedrick born in April 1973 who currently resides in Detroit, Michigan. Ava was from the Los Angeles suburb of Compton, California, and the four of them moved back to California after Philippé left The Spinners. Philippé and Ava eventually divorced. Alvarez was killed in a drive-by shooting in Compton in 1999 and Emmanuel, who was living in Daytona Beach, Florida, drowned two years later in 2001 while trying to save a man. Emmanuel was posthumously given the Carnegie Medal for his heroism.

==Death==
On July 13, 1984, Wynne suffered a heart attack while performing at a nightclub in Oakland, California. He died the next day, at the age of 43.

He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023 as a member of the Spinners.

<doc id="210583" wikidata="Q1538148" url="?curid=210583" title="Gordonstoun">
<text>Gordonstoun School ( ) is a co-educational independent school for boarding and day pupils in Moray, Scotland. It is named after the estate owned by Sir Robert Gordon in the 17th century; the school now uses this estate as its campus. It is located in Duffus to the north-west of Elgin. Pupils are accepted subject to an interview plus references and exam results.

It was founded in 1934 as the British Salem School by German-Jewish educator Kurt Hahn based on the model of Schule Schloss Salem, that he had founded in Germany in 1919. Gordonstoun has an enrolment of around 500 full boarders as well as about 100 day pupils between the ages of 5 and 18. With the number of teaching staff exceeding 100, there is a low student-teacher ratio compared to the average in the United Kingdom. There are eight boarding houses (formerly nine prior to the closure of Altyre house in summer 2016) including two 17th-century buildings that were part of the original estate. The other houses have been built or modified since the school was established.

Gordonstoun is included in The Schools Index as one of the 150 best private schools in the world and among top 30 senior schools in the UK.

==History==
===Founding===
The British Salem School of Gordonstoun was established in 1934 by Kurt Hahn, a German Jewish educationalist who, after being arbitrarily arrested after the Reichstag fire, fled Nazi Germany. Hahn was asked by friends to give a demonstration in the UK of his &quot;Salem system&quot;. He was born in Berlin in 1886 and studied at the University of Oxford. After reading Plato&#x27;s &quot;The Republic&quot; as a young man, Hahn conceived the idea of a modern school. With the help of Prince Max of Baden, he set up the Schule Schloss Salem in 1919. After the First World War, both men decided that education was key in influencing the future. They developed Salem to develop its students as community leaders. By the 1930s Salem had already become a renowned school throughout Europe. In 1932, Hahn spoke out against the Nazis and was arrested in March 1933.

He was released and exiled to Britain in the same year through the influence of the Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald, who was familiar with Hahn&#x27;s work. At the urging of British friends, Hahn decided to start a new school in Morayshire.

Gordonstoun was started in a small way and had financial difficulties in its early years. After the death in 1930 of Sir William Gordon-Cumming, 4th Baronet, his house at Gordonstoun was obtained by Kurt Hahn, whose offer for the lease was accepted on 14 March 1934. The buildings needed repair and renovation, and at the start of the first academic year, the school had only two enrolled pupils. Hahn expected Gordonstoun to operate for only a few years, as an example of his vision. The number of pupils steadily increased, and some additional pupils transferred from Salem, including Prince Philip of Greece, who later became Duke of Edinburgh. By the start of the Second World War, 135 boys were attending.

===World War II===
In June 1940 the school was evacuated and the Gordonstoun estate was taken over by the army for use as barracks. The school was relocated temporarily to quarters in Llandinam in Mid Wales when Lord Davies, a father of two pupils, allowed the school to use one of his houses, Broneirion. The buildings were insufficient, and finances and pupil numbers began to drop. In 1941 by Hahn and Lawrence Holt with the support of the Blue Funnel Line, founded Outward Bound, based on the educational approach of Gordonstoun.

The school survived the war, pupil numbers increased again, and the school became well known throughout Wales and the Midlands. Once the war ended, the school returned to the Gordonstoun estate.

===Post-war years===
By the end of 1940, the school achieved its primary target of 250 pupils and continued growing in size. It built dormitories on the estate, removing the need for maintaining a house in Altyre, Forres, many miles away from the main campus. Gordonstoun also developed its academic offerings. It arranged to admit poorer children from the surrounding areas, and to deepen the Outward Bound-type activities that were central to Hahn&#x27;s system. Skills in mountaineering and seamanship were always taught at the school. The introduction of the Moray Badge, from which the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award was borrowed, expanded the types of physical challenges for students to conquer.

From the 1950s onwards, the school administration concentrated on improving the facilities and expanding the curriculum. Major changes since then include: the founding of Round Square in 1966, an international community of schools sharing Hahn&#x27;s educational ideals; the school becoming co-educational in 1972; and the moving of Aberlour House, Gordonstoun&#x27;s preparatory school, from Speyside to a purpose-built Junior School on campus in 2004.

Former governor Lisa Kerr took over from Simon Reid as the school&#x27;s principal in 2016. She is the school&#x27;s first female principal.

==Overview==
===Ethos===
Gordonstoun&#x27;s curriculum emphasises an experiential approach, and built upon the work of educationalists, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, Johann Friedrich Herbart and John Dewey. However, unlike Herbart and Dewey, who were concerned with the cognitive benefits of out of classroom experiences, Hahn&#x27;s ethos emphasises the emotional aspects of Herbartianism and Experiential learning.

Hahn established Gordonstoun&#x27;s ethos during his tenure at Schule Schloss Salem. In a document, written in 1930, Hahn set out what he referred to as the seven laws of Salem;
# Give the children opportunities for self-discovery. 
# Make the children meet with triumph and defeat.
# Give the children the opportunity of self-effacement in the common cause.
# Provide periods of silence.
# Train the imagination. 
# Make games (i.e., competition) important but not predominant.
# Free the sons of the wealthy and powerful from the enervating sense of privilege.

Hahn blended outdoor activities and skills such as seamanship and mountaineering with a traditional private school ethos, modelled on his experiences at Eton and Oxford. Plato&#x27;s &quot;The Republic&quot; and other elements of ancient Greek history inspired Hahn&#x27;s approach. This is seen in the title &quot;Guardian&quot;, denoting the head boy and girl, the adoption of a Greek trireme as the school&#x27;s emblem, and a routine that could be described as Spartan.

Classics, and the Greek ideal that education aims to produce a complete person, intellectually, morally, physically and aesthetically had a profound influence on Hahn. Mostly, he believed that pupils should participate in activities, as opposed to sitting and absorbing information. Therefore, physical education forms much of Gordonstoun&#x27;s curriculum but achieving personal-goals and overcoming physical challenges take precedent over any competition. As part of their studies, Gordonstoun&#x27;s students complete something referred to as &quot;The Project&quot; a practical assignment of the student&#x27;s choosing. The result might be a handmade boat, a restored car or a piece of music.
Additionally, there is a chance to join one of the annual international service projects which take pupils abroad to help a foreign community, for instance, there have been projects to build schools in Africa, build wells in Thailand and help orphans in Romania.
 Hahn believed that an important part of education was to challenge a person and take them out of their areas of familiarity and comfort, improving a person&#x27;s ability to deal with difficult situations. The school requires that every pupil takes part in a series of outdoor programmes particularly expeditions in the Cairngorms and sailing training on the school&#x27;s 80-foot vessel, Ocean Spirit.
The school had a reputation for challenging conditions, with cold showers and morning runs as a matter of routine. The school still practices periods of silence, intended to give the pupils the space to reflect and glean insights from their experiences. The school no longer practices cold showers or punishment runs, although physical education and challenging outdoor activities are still an integral part of Gordonstoun&#x27;s identity. Former pupil Charles, Prince of Wales (later King Charles III) had called the school a &quot;Colditz in kilts&quot; alluding to the prisoner-of-war camp Colditz Castle.

Hahn believed that &quot;The Platonic view of education is that a nation must do all it can to make the individual citizen discover his own power and further more that the individual becomes a cripple in his or her point of view if he is not qualified by education to serve the community.&quot; The idea of service at the school is thought to encourage students to gain a feeling of responsibility to aid other people and is implemented in creating an array of services to the community in which every student becomes involved (see below).

===Alumni===

Gordonstoun has some notable alumni. Two generations of British royalty were educated at Gordonstoun, including Prince Philip and his son King Charles III. Rock musician David Bowie sent his son Duncan Jones to Gordonstoun, and Jason Connery, son of actor Sir Sean Connery, also attended. Due to Hahn&#x27;s influence, the school has had a strong connection with Germany. It is part of the Round Square Conference of Schools, a group of more than 80 schools across the globe based on the teaching of Hahn, and named after the Round Square building at Gordonstoun, where the first conference took place in 1967. Around 30% of students attending Gordonstoun come from abroad.

===Funding and fees===

Gordonstoun offers a series of grants, drawing on its investments and other funds, to support pupils who are unable to pay the full fees. In the academic year 2009/10 the school provided financial support for 163 pupils including 11 with 100% fee coverage and 95 with 50% fee reduction. The school is a registered charity: Scottish charity number SC037867.
Hahn&#x27;s views on education centred on the ability to understand different cultures. Gordonstoun incorporates this in a number of ways including its association with Round Square and in offering pupil exchanges to the different schools within the association.

In 2018, Simon Beames, senior lecturer in outdoor learning at the University of Edinburgh, co-published research the effectiveness of Gordonstoun&#x27;s ethos, and this research has formed an important part of the school&#x27;s promotional literature. A poll of alumni revealed mixed feelings about Gordonstoun&#x27;s emphasis on extra-curricular activities. Fifty-seven per cent of the former pupils surveyed agreed that outdoor activities enhanced their academic studies. At the same time, the remaining forty-three per cent felt the activities did not help their studies. However, the research by Beames et al. also found that most former pupils believe the school&#x27;s emphasis on outdoor activities had a positive effect on their careers.

===Gordonstoun Schools===
Along with the main school, two other schools form part of the greater Gordonstoun community. These are Gordonstoun&#x27;s preparatory school, Aberlour House, and a summer school that serves to promote the school outside of the academic year.

====Aberlour House====
The first preparatory school was founded in 1936 at Wester Elchies and unlike Gordonstoun, was not made to move during the war. At the start of the war, there were 40 boys and girls attending, and these numbers increased to the point that a second school was opened at Aberlour House in 1947 by which time nearly 100 pupils were attending.

Wester Elchies was pulled down in the early 1960s because of dilapidation. The prep school continued with just Aberlour, but even so, there were always problems with the that separated the main Gordonstoun campus and the school. In 2002 the running of Aberlour House was taken over by Gordonstoun, and in 2004 a purpose-built prep school was constructed on the main campus. In January 2007, the disused Aberlour House became the head offices of Walkers Shortbread, whose main factory complex at Fisherton is adjacent to the house.

Presently Aberlour House has approximately 115 pupils between the ages of 6 and 13 attending. Although they form part of the same institution, going to Aberlour is not a prerequisite for going to Gordonstoun and neither is it enforced that pupils at Aberlour House continue on into Gordonstoun. They share the school song, flag and motto with Gordonstoun.

====International Summer School====
The Gordonstoun International Summer School started in 1976, and it has catered to over 7,000 pupils since then. It opens for a four-week period every summer with the aim of giving a taste of the Gordonstoun ethos. Although for the most part, the priority is adventure, sports and creative arts, the school also teaches courses in English. Around 250 children from all over the world between the ages of 8 and 16 attend each year.

===Active revision programme=== 
The school runs a revision programme over the Easter Holidays, based on the belief that exercise improves cognition. Gordonstoun designed the programme for GCSE students, and it combines revision in English, mathematics and science with periods of gentle exercise and restricted access to electronic devices. The school also claims to serve a diet which promotes brain health throughout the programme.

===Academic curriculum===
Entrance to Gordonstoun requires the pupil to pass the Common Entrance Examination. In the Junior School (ages 8–13), pupils study a range of courses and follow the Scottish education system. In the Senior School (ages 13+) the pupils complete a year&#x27;s foundation course and then enter into the English education system by starting a two-year GCSE course followed by a two-year A Level course. Gordonstoun offers 21 GCSE courses, 27 AS Level courses and 21 A Level courses including specialised subjects such as Dance, Classical Studies and Further Mathematics.

The 2019 Education Scotland inspection of Gordonstoun rated the school as &#x27;outstanding&#x27; and &#x27;sector-leading&#x27;

The 2009 HMIE inspection evaluated Gordonstoun as being &#x27;Excellent&#x27; in its curriculum.

96% of pupils proceed to higher education with 79% going to British universities and 17% to universities abroad. Of those who do not go on to further education, many take gap years or join the armed forces.

==Activities==

===Sports===
In the beginning, Hahn expressed his view that at many schools, ball games had been given precedence over other activities and so, to start with, more focus was placed on seamanship and practical work than the playing of games. Due to this, competitive matches did not start until 1935 when Gordonstoun played and won its first rugby match against Grantown Academy. Even so, the school was still in its infancy, and there were no designated fields on which to play with conditions being so bad that during pre-match, half-time and post-match, players would clear as many pebbles off the field of play as possible. 1935 saw Gordonstoun&#x27;s cricket team win two, lose two and draw one. Hahn set up the hockey team personally, with Prince Philip humorously recalling a game against Elgin Academy&#x27;s ladies&#x27; team and saying that he &quot;hoped that soon we shall be among the best Scottish girls&#x27; teams.&quot;

As of 2013 there were playing fields for rugby, football and cricket as well as an outdoor hockey AstroTurf, outdoor tennis courts and a 400m running track. Apart from these outdoor pitches, there is a large sports centre with facilities that include a rock climbing wall, a 25m swimming pool, a weights room, squash courts and an indoor activity hall for basketball, badminton and netball.

Aside from these more traditional sports, there is the opportunity to participate in karate, horse riding, skiing, .22 rifle shooting and clay pigeon shooting, athletics, golf and many others. Clubs also form part of the activities list which is made up of cooking, debating, astronomy and film.

Sports and other physical activities are vital for an esteemed &quot;correct&quot; education at Gourdonstouns. Exercise is a key element in the everyday life at Gourdonstouns. All children subject to this physical curriculum must exercise for at least three-hour a day not to mention, much more.

====Football====
The 1st XI participate in four different competitions. The main competition is the County Schools League where Gordonstoun plays alongside nine other schools in a league system with the chance of promotion/relegation at the end of the season. The other three are Scottish Cup, North of Scotland Cup and the Scottish Independent Schools Cup where Gordonstoun plays with a mixture of independent and state schools.

===Service===
The school&#x27;s fire service works closely with the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and has a fire station on campus with two fire-fighting appliances at their disposal. It was started in 1940 while the school was based in Wales and they acquired an appliance soon after. They attend roughly fifty call-outs a year and so members have to be medically and physically fit, training to pass the practical test before becoming fire fighters. The team is split into three watches lasting a week each and are on call 24 hours a day having to carry pagers and react quickly should they be called.

===Seamanship===

Seamanship has been a main part of the curriculum since the school began. The first voyage of note was in a cutter from Hopeman to Dornoch in June 1935, a distance of . Pupils still train in cutters from the age of 13 upward at Hopeman Harbour to prepare for a voyage in the school&#x27;s sailing vessel. Most excursions take a week sailing off the West Coast of Scotland, but the school also enters into the Tall Ships&#x27; Races annually which allows pupils to take part in an international competition in European waters lasting up to a month.

===Robotics===
A student driven effort in 2023 led to the formation of VEX Robotics Team INT 46846T. The team, with their robot Carl, won its first competition, and continued their successes in their rookie campaign: won the Innovate Award at UK Nationals, qualified for the elimination round at the US Open in Council Bluffs, IA, and competed at the VEX World Championships in Dallas, Texas.

==Prefects==
In the lower school, ages 13 to 16, a boy and a girl in the sixth form (ages 16 to 18) are elected to be Captains of the lower school. They provide liaison between teachers and pupils so that any concerns can be rectified. Other roles can include organising inter-house activities, charitable events and the lower school social (&quot;social&quot; refers to social event or party).

In the Upper School, ages 16 to 18, responsibility is available through a hierarchy of positions. This starts with Captains of Sports, Service and House. In the case of Captains, no peer voting takes place, but rather a pupil is appointed by the Head of the respective department. This way it is not uncommon for some people to be re-appointed as Captain for multiple terms depending on whether or not anybody else of suitable stance is available. Captains of Sport such as the Football or Rugby Captain are chosen by the Head of that sport and will help the Head organise teams for practice and preparation off the field of play as well as on it. Similarly, Captains of Service will aid the Head of Service to organise training sessions and be a point of contact for the rest of the members.

Captains of House are slightly different though in that they play a more personal role for pupils who want to voice problems with conditions within the house and this often means that House Captains are responsible for many more pupils. This difference is more evident in their original title of &#x27;Helper&#x27;. They tend to be in close contact with the housemaster so that any issues requiring immediate attention can be dealt with as well as being able to relay any general ideas or concerns in the House Captains&#x27; Council which meet once every two weeks. At the meeting a teacher is present, and minutes are taken so that they can be passed onto the Colour Bearers (CBs).

Colour Bearers get their name from a band of purple they wear as insignia on their uniform, purple being one of the school&#x27;s colours. They are elected by the pupils and the staff, similar to Eton&#x27;s Pop, and have important roles in the school community as a whole. Unlike captains they keep their positions for a whole year unless they are demoted as a punishment for untoward behaviour. They meet every week with the Headmaster to attend to a wide range of school matters. As well as this they are responsible for minor roles which would otherwise be taken up by teaching staff such as, maintaining the refectory and the library and for serving drinks behind the bar at the weekly socials in addition to organising major school wide events that take place throughout the year.

From the CBs a boy and a girl are chosen to be Guardians for the academic term. These are the Head Pupils for the entire school and only normally 6 people a year are allowed to have this position. The term Guardian comes from the name of the supportive rulers of Plato&#x27;s ideal state. Like the staff, they are closely involved in the management and well-being of the school.

==Boarding houses==
There are seven boarding houses ranging from year 9–13, one sixth-form house, nine including the one no longer in operation, on the campus. The houses are run by a small team of teachers. The House Master (HM) has overall responsibility and is helped by the Assistant House Master (AHM). Either or both of these will be present at the daily house meeting and will oversee homework to make sure pupils are studying. The HM will organise any special house events, decide who the house captain will be for the term as well as choosing a captain to take care of other house related activities. The HM is also the person who most pupils would talk to if they had a problem although all teachers are available for help. Both the HM and the AHM normally have residences within the houses and so are very much part of the house. Each house has a matron who helps the pupils through their daily routine as well as a tutor to help the pupils in their studies. The year a pupil is in, and the number of rooms in the house decides which pupils are allowed a room of their own, although it is normally decided that younger years share whilst senior pupils get their own rooms. All pupils rotate rooms each term.

The houses are:

===Female===
*Hopeman House
*Plewlands House
*Windmill Lodge

===Male===
*Altyre House (pre-2016) 
*Bruce House 
*Cumming House 
*Duffus House
*Gordonstoun House (G-House; sixth-form only) (pre-2018) 
*Round Square

Some houses will go on house expeditions and there are many inter-house competitions that take place in the year. These competitions vary. The most common are sports such as basketball and football or simply a tug of war. All of the boarding houses throw a themed party annually, and pupils may invite guests from other houses.

==Old Gordonstounians==

For OGs there is the Gordonstoun Association which aims to promote and strengthen links between former pupils of the school and the school itself. The patron of the GA is King Charles III. The position was previously held by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

===British royal family===

During the 1960s, Charles, Prince of Wales (later King Charles III) attended the school on the recommendation of his father, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who had been one of the first pupils to attend Gordonstoun, having previously been educated at Salem in Germany. Prince Charles did not enjoy the regime, which he later characterised as &quot;Colditz in kilts&quot;, but said it taught him self-discipline and responsibility. Princes Andrew and Edward followed in their father&#x27;s and elder brother&#x27;s footsteps. Of the four princes, three (Philip, Charles and Edward) were appointed Guardian (Head Boy) during their time at the school. Princess Anne, Philip&#x27;s only daughter, was not educated at Gordonstoun, which at that time was for boys only, but she sent her two children, Peter and Zara, while also serving for some time on the school&#x27;s board of governors.

Gordonstoun also has a notable fictional alumna: the heroine of &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, Lady Lara Croft, was supposed to have attended the school in sixth year; she has also been used to advertise it.

==Controversies==
In 2010, a teacher had their teaching licence/qualification revoked by the General Teaching Council for Scotland for warning students about exam content in advance of the tests.

In 2020, the school carried out renovations which included work on principal Lisa Kerr&#x27;s living quarters. An unnamed source claimed that the renovations cost approximately £100,000 and included £8,000 for carpets and £6,000 for flooring. Speaking to the Times, the school confirmed that Kerr &quot;contributed significantly&quot; to the costs and that the renovations had &quot;become urgent in order to reconfigure classrooms and increase cleaning regimes to comply with Covid regulations&quot;.

===Child abuse===
In 2017, Gordonstoun was named as one of the schools being investigated in the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry chaired by Lady Smith. In 2021 Gordonstoun said at the inquiry that there had been 11 cases of pupil abuse and 82 claims of bullying between students, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1995 the school had started a child protection policy and in 2013 there had been &quot;significant&quot; abuse disclosures. The school issued a &quot;sincere and unreserved apology&quot; to pupils who had undergone abuse.

In 2018, ex-teacher Andrew Keir was convicted of offences including indecent assault involving thirteen-year-old pupils at the school between 1988 and 1991. He was subsequently jailed for twelve months. In June 2024 an inquiry ruled that abuse took place at the school unchecked for decades. Lady Smith, chairwoman of the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry (SCAI), said &quot;I have no difficulty in finding that children were abused at Gordonstoun and Aberlour in a variety of ways over a long period of time.&quot;

==Television appearances==
===&quot;True Stories&quot;===
In 1996, the school appeared on an episode of Channel Four&#x27;s &quot;True Stories&quot;. Filmmaker Penny Woodcock shot the documentary during the autumn term. Despite preconceptions that Gordonstoun was one of Britain&#x27;s stricter boarding schools; Woodcock&#x27;s documentary depicted a compassionate and liberal institution led at that time by the headteacher Mark Pyper. The programme gave insights into the school&#x27;s management, conflict resolution processes and day-to-day life. Highlights included technologically literate students using a modified Walkman to trigger amplified toilet flushes during the daily sermon and a candid interview with the school&#x27;s sailing instructor.

===&quot;The Crown&quot;===
In December 2017, a fictionalised depiction of the school featured in episode 9 of season 2 of the Netflix TV series &quot;The Crown&quot;. Left Bank Pictures filmed ten of the scenes on the grounds of Gloucestershire&#x27;s Woodchester Mansion.

Queen Elizabeth II reportedly felt &quot;sad and annoyed&quot; by how the episode portrayed the relationship between Charles and Philip during Charles&#x27; time at Gordonstoun. The episode states at its end that Charles later described his time at Gordonstoun as a &quot;prison sentence&quot;.

The school disputed the series&#x27; portrayal of Charles&#x27; alma mater, citing in their defence a 1970s speech he made in the House of Lords and an interview published in &quot;The Observer&quot; where he gave a nuanced recollection of the school.

==Legacy==
===Outward bound===
Gordonstoun temporarily relocated to Aberdyfi, Wales during World War II, while the British Army used the Gordonstoun estate as barracks. 
Hahn worked with friends and fellow educationalist, Lawrence Durning Holt and Jim Hogan. Holt was a partner in the Alfred Holt and Company who owned the Blue Funnel Line. Hogan was the Warden of The Blue Funnel Line&#x27;s sea school in Aberdyfi, which provided four-year character-building courses and practical training to young, prospective officers. The courses included preparations for a land-based expedition as the course&#x27; finale. Due to the necessities of World War II, Aberdyfi focused on Seamanship. However, the courses&#x27; founders later claimed that their sea school didn&#x27;t offer &quot;training for the Sea&quot;, but &quot;Training through the sea&quot;.

===Duke of Edinburgh Award===
Hahn founded the Moray Badge scheme in 1937. The scheme gave Moray&#x27;s local children training by taking part in expeditions before completing a final project to earn the award. The Duke of Edinburgh completed his Moray badge while at Gordonstoun. Hahn approached the Duke of Edinburgh after World War II about the prospect of creating a national awards scheme based on the Moray Badge. At the time a gap existed for boys leaving school aged 15 and beginning National Service aged 18. Therefore, its founders aimed the original Duke of Edinburgh award at boys aged 15 to 18.

===Influence on state education===
In the U.S., Hahn&#x27;s Outward-Bound approach inspired an English and Arts Curriculum known as EL Education. From 2009, U.S schools adopted the ELA curriculum after the formation of the Common Core State Standards Initiative.
In Britain, former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan voiced a need for a greater curricular emphasis on character building. At the same time the educational advisor John Cridland and former shadow education minister Tristram Hunt began using phrases such as &quot;rounded and grounded&quot;, &quot;resilience&quot;, &quot;team-building&quot; and &quot;communication skills&quot; when discussing education.

<text>The Skoda 150 mm Model 1918 was a heavy mountain howitzer, manufactured by Skoda Works. The design was begun during World War I, but the first prototype was completed as the war ended. After 1938, the Wehrmacht designated the few built as 15 cm GebH 18(t), although it&#x27;s uncertain if they were actually used. The gun could be transported on six carts; each cart pulled by at least two horses or mules. The barrel assembly required three towing animals.

<doc id="210589" wikidata="Q188810" url="?curid=210589" title="Emirate of Sharjah">
<text>The Emirate of Sharjah (; &quot;&quot;) is one of the emirates of the United Arab Emirates, which covers and has a population of over 1,400,000 (2015). It comprises the capital city of Sharjah, after which it is named, and other minor towns and exclaves such as Kalba, Al Dhaid, Dibba Al-Hisn and Khor Fakkan.

The emirate is an absolute monarchy. It has been ruled by Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi since 1972, except for a seven-day period during an attempted coup d&#x27;etat by his brother, Sheikh Abd al-Aziz bin Muhammad Al Qasimi.

==History==

Human settlement in the area covered by the emirate has existed for over 120,000 years, with significant finds made of early axes and stone tools as well as Copper and Iron Age implements in Al Dhaid, Al Thuqeibah, Mileiha, Tell Abraq, Muwailah, Al Madam and Jebel Faya. Archaeological finds in the Mleiha area point to human habitation consistent with the spread of humanity from Africa to the wider world, evidenced by finds displayed at the Mleiha Archaeological Centre.

Historically the emirate was one of the wealthiest towns in the region.

Around 1727, the Al Qasimi clan took control of Sharjah and declared the polity independent.

The first in a long series of maritime skirmishes between the Al Qasimi and British vessels took place in 1797, when the British-flagged snow the &quot;Bassein&quot; was seized and released two days later. The cruiser &quot;Viper &quot;was subsequently attacked off Bushire. The Al Qasimi leader, Saqr bin Rashid Al Qasimi, protested innocence in both cases.

A period of great instability followed along the coast, with a number of actions between British and Al Qasimi vessels alongside various changes of leadership and allegiances between the Rulers of Ras Al Khaimah, Ajman and Sharjah with Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi claiming sovereignty over &#x27;all the Joasmee ports&#x27; in 1823, a claim recognised by the British at the time.

On 8 January 1820, Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi signed the General Maritime Treaty with Britain, accepting protectorate status in order to resist Ottoman domination. Following the expiration of a further, ten year, treaty in 1843, on 4 May 1853 Sharjah, along with other Sheikhdoms on what was then known as the &#x27;Arabian Coast&#x27; signed the Perpetual Treaty of Peace, which gave rise to the collective name Trucial States being given to the emirates of the coast.

Like four of its neighbours, Ajman, Dubai, Ras Al Khaimah, and Umm Al Quwain, its position along trade routes to India made it important enough to be recognised as a salute state.

Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, Sharjah was an important pearl fishing port. A British marine survey of 1830 found &#x27;three to four hundred boats&#x27; fishing in the season, earning the ruler 100,000 Maria Theresa Dollars.

In 1932, Imperial Airways established a regular air service through Sharjah, which was an overnight stop on the Eastern British Empire route. The Mahatta Fort was built to house the airline&#x27;s guests.

On 2 December 1971, Sheikh Khalid bin Mohammed Al Qasimi joined Sharjah to the United Arab Emirates. On 24 January 1972 however, the former ruler Sheikh Saqr bin Sultan Al Qasimi staged a leftist coup. Having previously deposed Saqr in 1965, Sheikh Khalid had ordered the demolition of Sharjah Fort (Al Hisn Sharjah) to expunge Saqr&#x27;s memory. Saqr took over Khalid&#x27;s palace, holding him inside and in the ensuing confusion Sheikh Khalid was killed. Saqr was arrested and Khalid&#x27;s brother, Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi, an author and historian, came to power.

In 1987, Sultan&#x27;s brother Abdulaziz staged a coup while Sultan was abroad. Huge state debt was stated as the reason. Then-UAE President Zayed denounced the coup, and a deal was reached for Sultan to be restored, while Abdulaziz would become the deputy ruler. Sultan, however, dismissed Abdulaziz quite quickly. In 1999, the Crown Prince (Sultan&#x27;s eldest son) died of a drug overdose while on vacation in their palace in England. Sultan made the decision to testify in front of a UK court. The new Crown Prince, Sheikh Sultan bin Mohammed bin Sultan Al Qasimi, was appointed from a remote branch of the family.

==Geography==

Sharjah is the third largest emirate in the United Arab Emirates, and is the only one to have land on both the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. The emirate covers which is equivalent to 3.3 per cent of the UAE&#x27;s total area, excluding the islands. It has a population of over 1,800,000 (2022). The city lies away from the UAE capital city Abu Dhabi.

The emirate of Sharjah comprises the city of Sharjah (the seat of the emirate), and other minor towns and enclaves. The city of Sharjah, which overlooks the Persian Gulf, has a population of 1,600,000 (2022 census). Sharjah City borders Dubai to the south and Ajman to the north, and the three form a conurbation. Sharjah also owns three enclaves on the east coast, bordering the Gulf of Oman. These are Kalba, Dibba Al-Hisn, and Khor Fakkan, which provide Sharjah with a major east coast port. In the Persian Gulf, the island of Sir Abu Nu’ayr belongs to Sharjah, and Abu Musa is claimed by UAE, but controlled by Iran. Sharjah has an exclave containing the village of Nahwa, located inside the Omani enclave of Madha which borders Fujairah and Sharjah. The emirate also encompasses some important oasis areas, the most famous of which is the fertile Dhaid region, where a range of vegetables and fruits are cultivated.

The ruler of Sharjah appoints members of the Sharjah Executive Council and the Sharjah Consultative Council to manage the day-to-day affairs of the emirate. Sharjah has devolved some authority of local decisions to Emiri Diwans (Ruler&#x27;s Courts) in areas such Kalba and Khor Fakkan. Nevertheless, the Sharjah Executive Council retains authority to manage government departments and affairs in line with policies and decrees by the ruler of Sharjah. Collectively, the government of Sharjah has over 126 government departments and public organisations under its responsibility and control with a number of services provided through a Sharjah e-government portal.

===Commerce and Tourism Development Authority===

The Sharjah Commerce and Tourism Development Authority (SCDTA) was established by decree in 1996 to &quot;promote commercial and tourism activities&quot; in the emirate. The state-backed authority is responsible for, among other things, creating policies for local and international exhibitions and marketing Sharjah to attract foreign investment and tourists.

One such initiative, is the annual Sharjah Light Festival, which showcases the emirate&#x27;s landmarks through vibrant light shows and attracts thousands of visitors each year.
===Investment and Development Authority===
The Sharjah Investment and Development Authority (Shurooq) was established in 2009 as an independent government body to &quot;oversee the social, cultural, environmental and economic development of Sharjah in line with its Islamic identity.&quot; It focuses on three areas for the emirate; investment, development, and asset and property management. Shurooq&#x27;s developments include:
* Al Qasba – 10,000-acre project including a -long man-made canal and high observation wheel, it was made open for the public in 2005. It includes Masrah Al Qasba, a theatre, the Maraya Art Centre, the Multaqa Al Qasba meetings and conference centre and a children&#x27;s Fun Zone. The project, managed by the Al Qasba Development Authority (an affiliate of Shurooq) has an architectural design including pedestrian bridges, boats, and lagoons. It attracted two million visitors in 2011.
* Al Majaz Waterfront – Shurooq opened the Al Majaz Waterfront in December 2011 after redeveloping it. The new park, located between Jamal Abdul Nasser Street and Khalid Lagoon Corniche, covers an area of for recreation, including six new buildings with restaurants and a tall water fountain.

* The Chedi Khorfakkan Resort – The Chedi Khorfakkan, scheduled to open in 2015, is under construction an hour outside of Sharjah city centre. Shurooq has stated that once complete, the project will include a tourist resort and a fort on the Al Suwifa Mountain.

===Decency laws===
Conservative Sharjah is the only Emirate in the UAE in which the sale of alcohol is prohibited, although its consumption in one&#x27;s own home is permissible if one is in possession of a valid Alcohol Licence (as is the transportation of alcohol between the place of sale and the home). The only place this prohibition is relaxed is the members-only sporting club, the Sharjah Wanderers.

Sharjah also maintains the strictest decency laws in the UAE, introduced in 2001, with a conservative dress code required for both men and women. Mixing between unmarried men and women is illegal: &quot;A man and a woman who are not in a legally acceptable relationship should not be alone in public places, or in suspicious times or circumstances,&quot; according to a booklet published by the municipality in 2001.

==Demographics==

The 2022 census for the Emirate of Sharjah noted that the population of the emirate had reached 1.8 million, representing a 22% increase from the prior census in 2015 which had tallied a population of 1.4 million for the emirate. Emirati citizens represented 11.5% of the total population, with 208,000 citizens in the 2022 census - almost evenly divided between males and females. However, when considering non-nationals, there were 1.1 million men living the emirate compared to 500,000 women. in 2022.

Over 51% of the population were in the 20-39 age group, and Sharjah was the largest settlement with 1.6 million residents, followed by Khor Fakkan with 53,000 and Kalba with 51,000.

The Hamriyah Free Zone Authority was established by an Emiri decree issued on 12 November 1995 and consists of a port and associated logistics and trade facilities.

Also established in 1995, the SAIF Zone is adjacent to Sharjah International Airport and is currently home to some 2,500 companies.

This monument was moved to a new location at the entrance to Sharjah&#x27;s University City, where it was joined by a monument to Sharjah&#x27;s 2014 nomination as Islamic Culture Capital by the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (ISESCO), a specialised institution of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in the fields of Education, Science and Culture.

===Sharjah Art Foundation===

It was founded, built and operated from 1976 to 1989 by Frederick Pittera, an international producer of Trade &amp; Consumer Fairs. The event typically attracts hundreds of local and international publishers and thousands of titles.

==Stamps==

In 1963, Britain ceded responsibility for the Trucial States&#x27; postal systems. An American philatelic entrepreneur by the name of Finbar Kenny saw the opportunity to create a number of editions of stamps aimed at the lucrative collector&#x27;s market and in 1964 concluded a deal with a number of Trucial States to take the franchise for the production of stamps for their respective governments. Kenny had made something of a speciality out of signing these deals, also signing with the Rulers of Ajman and Fujairah in 1964—and getting involved in a bribery case in the USA over his dealings with the government of the Cook Islands. The issue of stamps from Ajman&#x27;s dependency of Manama—a tiny agrarian village in the remote plains at which a &#x27;post office&#x27; was opened—is a perfect example.

These stamps, luridly illustrated and irrelevant to the actual emirates they purported to come from (editions included &#x27;Space Research&#x27; and &#x27;Tokyo Olympic Games&#x27;) became known as &#x27;dunes&#x27;. Their proliferation quickly devalued them.

Sharjah is therefore known by many stamp collectors for these issues by the Sharjah Post Office shortly before the formation of the United Arab Emirates. Many of these items are not listed by many popular catalogues.

==Sports==

Sport establishments in Sharjah are managed by the Sharjah Sports Council.

===Cricket===
The Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium has hosted almost 200 cricket One Day Internationals, more than any other ground in UAE, and 4 Test matches. Since 2003, the increasingly crowded cricket calendar has precluded the holding of any major international matches at Sharjah although the stadium has been the venue for certain other matches, such as the 2004 ICC Intercontinental Cup. The use of the venue has declined as the new 20,000-seat Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi has become the preferred venue for cricket in the UAE.

===Football===
Football teams in Sharjah emirate:
# Sharjah FC
# Al Shaab Sports Club (defunct)
# Al Hamriyah Club
# Al Bataeh Club
# Al Dhaid SC
# Al-Ittihad Kalba SC 
# Khor Fakkan Club 
# Dibba Al-Hisn Sports Club

===Powerboat racing===
Sharjah has hosted the F1 Powerboat Race since 2000. The December event is held during the Sharjah Water Festival and attracts over 75,000 visitors to the emirate. Since 2016 the event is also combined with Aquabike World Championship (powerboating) making the Grand Prix of Sharjah the final of the two main disciplines in Powerboating World

<text>Oliver Taylor Hawkins (February 17, 1972 – March 25, 2022) was an American musician who was the drummer and a vocalist of the rock band Foo Fighters, sharing vocals with Dave Grohl. He joined the band in 1997, and remained the band&#x27;s drummer until his death in March 2022. He recorded eight studio albums with Foo Fighters between 1999 and 2021. Before joining the band, he was a touring drummer for Sass Jordan and Alanis Morissette, as well as the drummer of the progressive experimental band Sylvia.

In 2004, Hawkins formed his own side project, Taylor Hawkins and the Coattail Riders, in which he played drums and sang, releasing three studio albums between 2006 and 2019. He formed the supergroup NHC with Jane&#x27;s Addiction members Dave Navarro and Chris Chaney in 2020, where he also took on lead vocal and drumming duties.

One year before his death, Hawkins was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2021 as a member of Foo Fighters. He was voted &quot;Best Rock Drummer&quot; in 2005 by the British drumming on magazine &quot;Rhythm&quot;. After his death, the Foo Fighters and his family announced two tribute shows, which took place in September 2022.

==Early life==
Oliver Taylor Hawkins was born in Fort Worth, Texas, on February 17, 1972. His family moved to Laguna Beach, California, in 1976, where Hawkins grew up. Hawkins was the youngest of three, with an older brother and sister, Jason and Heather. He graduated from Laguna Beach High School in 1990, where he had been friends with future Yes lead vocalist Jon Davison.

==Career==
===Early career===
Hawkins played in the Orange County–based band Sylvia before he became the drummer for Sass Jordan.

From June 1995 until March 1997, Hawkins was Alanis Morissette&#x27;s drummer on the tour supporting &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; and her Can&#x27;t Not tour. He appeared in the videos for &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, &quot;All I Really Want&quot;, and &quot;You Learn&quot;. He also appeared on Morissette&#x27;s VHS/DVD &quot;Jagged Little Pill, Live&quot; (1997).

===Foo Fighters===

After touring through the spring of 1996, Foo Fighters entered a Seattle studio with producer Gil Norton to record their second album. Conflict during recording reportedly erupted between Dave Grohl and drummer William Goldsmith, eventually causing Goldsmith to leave the band. The band regrouped in Los Angeles and almost completely re-recorded the album with Grohl on drums. The album, &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot;, was released on May 20, 1997. Grohl called Hawkins, an acquaintance at the time, seeking his recommendations for a new drummer to join the band. Grohl was under the impression that Hawkins would not want to leave Morissette&#x27;s touring band, given she was a bigger act than Foo Fighters at the time. To Grohl&#x27;s surprise, however, Hawkins volunteered to join the band himself, explaining that he wanted to be a drummer in a rock band rather than for a solo act. The band announced Hawkins would be its new drummer on March 18, 1997. Hawkins first appeared with the Foo Fighters in the music video for the 1997 single &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot;, although the song was recorded before he joined the band.

In addition to his drumming with the Foo Fighters, Hawkins provided vocals, guitar, and piano to various recordings. He performed the lead vocal on a cover of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Have a Cigar&quot;. Two versions of the song were released, one as the B-side to &quot;Learn to Fly&quot; and another on the &quot;&quot; soundtrack album. He later sang lead vocals on &quot;Cold Day in the Sun&quot; from &quot;In Your Honor&quot;, which was later released as a single, as well as a cover of Cream&#x27;s &quot;I Feel Free&quot;, which appeared as the B-side of &quot;DOA&quot; and on the EP &quot;Five Songs and a Cover&quot;. Hawkins also sang lead vocals for the band&#x27;s cover of Joe Walsh&#x27;s &quot;Life of Illusion&quot;. Later, he sang lead vocals for &quot;Sunday Rain&quot;, a track on the Foo Fighters&#x27; 2017 album &quot;Concrete and Gold&quot;. He sang lead vocals on some songs during Foo Fighters live shows, particularly covers, such as Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout Love&quot; and Queen&#x27;s &quot;Somebody To Love&quot;, the latter of which he performed during what became his final concert with the band. He also contributed to the band&#x27;s songwriting, and was listed as a co-writer on at least one song on every Foo Fighters album from &quot;There Is Nothing Left to Lose&quot; to &quot;Medicine at Midnight&quot;.

Hawkins&#x27; final performance with the Foo Fighters before his death was at the Lollapalooza Argentina festival on March 20, 2022. Hawkins posthumously won three Grammys with the Foo Fighters on April 3, 2022.

=== Other projects ===

In 2000, Hawkins was contacted by Guns N&#x27; Roses to replace Josh Freese on drums. Hawkins seriously considered the offer before Roger Taylor convinced him to remain in Foo Fighters.
In 2006, Hawkins released a self-titled LP with his side project, Taylor Hawkins and the Coattail Riders. Taylor Hawkins and the Coattail Riders subsequently released two more studio albums: &quot;Red Light Fever&quot; in 2010, and &quot;Get the Money&quot; in 2019. He occasionally played with a Police cover band alternately called the Cops and Fallout. At Live Earth in 2007, Hawkins was part of SOS Allstars with Roger Taylor of Queen and Chad Smith of Red Hot Chili Peppers.

Hawkins recorded the drum tracks for the Coheed and Cambria album &quot;Good Apollo, I&#x27;m Burning Star IV, Volume Two: No World for Tomorrow&quot; as the band&#x27;s regular drummer, Chris Pennie, could not record because of contractual reasons. Hawkins also toured with Coheed and Cambria shortly during the months of the album. Hawkins can also be heard drumming on Eric Avery&#x27;s (formerly of Jane&#x27;s Addiction) first solo effort, &quot;Help Wanted&quot; and on Kerry Ellis&#x27;s album, &quot;Wicked in Rock&quot;. Hawkins and Grohl split drumming duties on &quot;Harmony &amp; Dissidence&quot;, the third album by Foo Fighters bandmate Chris Shiflett&#x27;s own side project, Jackson United.

Hawkins played on the track &quot;Cyborg&quot;, from Queen guitarist Brian May&#x27;s 1998 solo album, &quot;Another World&quot;; he also played drums at VH1&#x27;s Rock Honors 2006 while Queen performed &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;. He sang backing vocals on the Queen + Paul Rodgers single, &quot;C-lebrity&quot;.

Hawkins was commissioned to complete an unfinished recording of a song by Beach Boys&#x27; drummer Dennis Wilson titled &quot;Holy Man&quot; by writing and singing new lyrics. The recording, which also featured contributions from Brian May and Roger Taylor of Queen, was issued as a single for Record Store Day in 2019.

While the Foo Fighters were on break in 2013, Hawkins formed a rock cover band called Chevy Metal.
Hawkins appeared on Slash&#x27;s solo album &quot;Slash&quot;, released in 2010, providing backing vocals on the track &quot;Crucify the Dead&quot;, featuring Ozzy Osbourne.

In 2013, he made his acting debut in the role of Iggy Pop in the rock film &quot;CBGB&quot;. Hawkins recorded the drums on Vasco Rossi&#x27;s last song, &quot;L&#x27;uomo più semplice&quot;. This song was released on January 21, 2013, in Italy.

In March 2014, Hawkins announced his new side project called the Birds of Satan. It features Hawkins&#x27;s drum technician and bandmate from Chevy Metal, Wiley Hodgden on bass guitar and vocals as well as guitarist Mick Murphy also of Chevy Metal. The band&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released in April 2014, with a release party at &#x27;Rock n Roll Pizza&#x27; featuring the Foo Fighters guesting on some of the cover tracks.

In an interview with Radio X, Hawkins revealed that his initial idea with his solo projects was to duet with female singers.

Hawkins invited other stars to sing in the Taylor Hawkins and the Coattail Riders album &quot;Get the Money&quot;, such as LeAnn Rimes, who sang on one of his songs titled &quot;C U In Hell&quot;. &quot;Loudwire&quot; named the album one of the 50 best rock efforts of 2019. Other musicians who appeared on his projects included Roger Taylor, Brian May, Dave Grohl, Nancy Wilson, Joe Walsh, Chrissie Hynde, and many more.

In October 2021, Elton John released &quot;The Lockdown Sessions&quot;, which featured Hawkins playing drums on the song &quot;E-Ticket&quot;.

In 2021, Hawkins and Jane&#x27;s Addiction members Dave Navarro and Chris Chaney formed a supergroup called NHC. Described by Hawkins as being &quot;somewhere between Rush and the Faces&quot;, the band made its live debut in September 2021 at Eddie Vedder&#x27;s Ohana festival, with Taylor&#x27;s Foo Fighters bandmate Pat Smear on additional guitar. The band recorded an album in 2021, which released in 2022.

Along with the other members of Foo Fighters, Hawkins starred as himself in the comedy horror film &quot;Studio 666&quot;, released on February 25, 2022. He posthumously appears on select tracks on Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s 2022 album &quot;Patient Number 9&quot; and Iggy Pop&#x27;s 2023 album &quot;Every Loser&quot;.

==Influences==

Hawkins said that his drumming was chiefly influenced by classic rock drummers, including Phil Collins of Genesis; Stewart Copeland of the Police, whom he idolized and eventually befriended; Budgie of Siouxsie and the Banshees; Roger Taylor of Queen; Stephen Perkins of Jane&#x27;s Addiction; Jim Gordon of Derek and the Dominos; Neil Peart of Rush; Alex Van Halen of Van Halen; and John Bonham from Led Zeppelin.

Hawkins was once guest editor of &quot;Rhythm&quot; and interviewed Collins, Copeland, Taylor, and Perkins for the issue.
Hawkins&#x27;s first two major inspirations were Roger Taylor and Stewart Copeland. He reported that listening to these two drummers&#x27; different styles showed him a wide spectrum of drumming style. He also mentioned that he would play along with songs on the radio or records, like Queen&#x27;s &quot;News of the World&quot;, to enhance his skills when he was young.

==Equipment==
During his career, Hawkins used a variety of different brands, including Ludwig Drums, Tama Drums, and, most notably, Gretsch Drums, which he endorsed and played from 2005 until his death. He was also known to use Zildjian Cymbals.

==Personal life==
Hawkins and his wife, Alison, married in 2005. Together they had three children, including Shane Hawkins. They lived in Hidden Hills, California, after moving from Topanga Canyon in 2012.

Hawkins overdosed on heroin in August 2001, which left him in a coma for two weeks. Hawkins&#x27; bandmate and best friend, Dave Grohl, was beside his hospital bed in London for two weeks until he woke up. Grohl said he was ready to quit music while Hawkins was in the hospital. He also revealed in the 2011 documentary &quot;Foo Fighters: Back and Forth&quot;, that he wrote the song &quot;On the Mend&quot; from the band&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;In Your Honor&quot; about Hawkins while he was in a coma. Speaking to Beats 1 host Matt Wilkinson in 2018 about the incident, Hawkins said: &quot;I was partying a lot. I wasn&#x27;t a junkie, per se, but I was partying. There was a year where the partying just got a little too heavy. Thank God on some level this guy gave me the wrong line with the wrong thing one night and I woke up going, &#x27;What the fuck happened?&#x27; That was a real changing point for me.&quot; In the same interview, Hawkins also said he was sober.

Hawkins suffered from stage fright. Speaking about his health in a June 2021 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, Hawkins said: &quot;I&#x27;m healthy. I&#x27;m good... I get sinus infections really bad. And I just found out from my doctor, got all my blood tests and my heart everything checked and he goes, &#x27;Dude, you&#x27;re in amazing shape. Your heart&#x27;s big, because you exercise a lot. It&#x27;s like a runner&#x27;s heart.&#x27; And that&#x27;s fine. The only thing is, he said, &#x27;I think you have sleep apnea.&#x27; And my wife&#x27;s always saying you snore and you fucking make weird noises while you&#x27;re sleeping and stuff.&quot;

== Death ==

On March 25, 2022, Hawkins was in Bogotá, Colombia, where he was scheduled to perform with the Foo Fighters later that evening. After Hawkins complained of chest pains, emergency services were called up to his room at the Four Seasons Casa Medina hotel. Health personnel arrived and found Hawkins unresponsive; they performed CPR, but he was declared dead at the scene, aged 50. His cause of death was not immediately revealed.

It was reported that Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee was one of the last people to speak to Hawkins, just hours before his death, in a phone conversation to Hawkins&#x27; hotel room.

The following day, Colombian authorities announced that a preliminary urine toxicology test indicated that Hawkins had 10 substances in his system at the time of his death, including opioids, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and THC.

Colombia&#x27;s National Institute of Forensic Medicine stated that they would &quot;continue the medical studies to achieve total clarification of the events that led to the death of Taylor Hawkins&quot;, and the attorney general&#x27;s office would continue to investigate his cause of death in a &quot;timely manner&quot;.

A May 2022 article from Andy Greene and Kory Grow in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; made the case that Hawkins was suffering from extreme exhaustion in the period leading up to his death, and allegedly asked that no more dates be added to the scheduled tour. However, two of the interviewees, Chad Smith and Matt Cameron, have since disavowed the article, stating that they were quoted out of context and that their comments were misrepresented. Noting that official autopsy results had not, at that time, been made public, the Green–Grow article went on to state that &quot;his friends believe[d] he wasn&#x27;t using hard drugs recreationally at the time of his death&quot; and that the post-mortem forensics performed indicated that the mass of Hawkins&#x27; heart was &quot;about double... normal size&quot; (indicating cardiomegaly), raising the possibility that &quot;it could have collapsed&quot; apart from any contribution of drugs in his system.&quot;

=== Tribute concerts ===
The Foo Fighters announced the death of Hawkins in a Twitter statement on March 25, writing that &quot;His musical spirit and infectious laughter will live on with all of us forever.&quot; On March 29, the band cancelled all their upcoming shows. On the night of his death, Hawkins was scheduled to perform with the Foo Fighters at the Estéreo Picnic Festival in Bogotá as part of their ongoing South American tour. The festival stage was turned into a candlelight vigil for Hawkins.

On June 8, 2022, the Foo Fighters and the family of Hawkins announced two shows in tribute to Hawkins. The first show, played at Wembley Stadium in London, took place on September 3, 2022. The Foo Fighters were joined by Travis Barker, Nandi Bushell, Martin Chambers, Chris Chaney, Dave Chappelle, Stewart Copeland, Josh Freese, Liam Gallagher, Omar Hakim, Justin Hawkins, Joshua Homme, Chrissie Hynde, the James Gang, Alain Johannes, Brian Johnson, John Paul Jones, Greg Kurstin, Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, Brian May, Paul McCartney, Chris Rock, Nile Rodgers, Mark Ronson, Sam Ryder, Luke Spiller, Supergrass, Roger Taylor, Rufus Taylor, Lars Ulrich, and Wolfgang Van Halen, plus members of Hawkins&#x27;s cover band, Chevy Metal. His son Oliver Shane Hawkins paid tribute to his father with the band during a performance of &quot;My Hero&quot; by taking on his father&#x27;s role as drummer. The concert at Wembley Stadium was streamed live on YouTube and Paramount+, with a rerun being broadcast on CBS. Shane Hawkins was awarded the &#x27;Drum Performance of the Year&#x27; at the Drumeo Awards for this performance.

The guest list reunited, in whole or in part, several of Hawkins&#x27; favorite bands, including Queen and Rush. Some had not played together for a long time, including Grohl&#x27;s supergroup Them Crooked Vultures (12 years) and the James Gang (16 years).

The second tribute concert, at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California, took place on September 27, 2022, and featured Hawkins&#x27; bandmates as well as numerous guest artists. Returning from the London show were Barker, Copeland, Hakim, Homme, Johannes, Jones, Kurstin, Lee, Lifeson, May, Novoselic, Ronson, Smith, Spiller, Roger Taylor, Rufus Taylor, Ulrich, Van Halen, the James Gang, and Chevy Metal. Also appearing were Jack Black, Geezer Butler, Danny Carey, Phil Collen, Miley Cyrus, Joe Elliott, Joan Jett, Mark King, Tommy Lee, Taylor Momsen, Alanis Morissette, Pink, Nikki Sixx, Chad Smith, Jon Theodore, Brad Wilk, Nancy Wilson, and Patrick Wilson. Shane Hawkins has been playing with Chevy Metal in his father&#x27;s place.

<text>Dorothy Dickson (July 25, 1893 – September 25, 1995) was an American-born, London-based theater actress and singer, and a centenarian.

==Biography and career==
Dickson is known mostly for her rendition of the Jerome Kern song &quot;Look for the Silver Lining&quot;. She was also a member of the Ziegfeld Follies and made many appearances in New York and abroad. In 1922, she starred in &quot;The Cabaret Girl&quot;. In 1936, she co-starred with Ivor Novello in his &quot;Careless Rapture&quot; and, in 1937, in his &quot;Crest of the Wave&quot;.

Dickson starred in a few silent films, including &quot;Eastward Ho!&quot; (1919) and &quot;Paying the Piper&quot; (1921).

During her early days on the London stage, Dickson was introduced to (as well as centenarian) Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, later the Queen Mother. The two became close friends and their friendship lasted until Dickson&#x27;s death at age 102. Her daughter was the actress Dorothy Hyson, who was married to Sir Anthony Quayle.

During the Second World War she was involved in organising the London version of Stage Door Canteen.

In 2006, Angus McBean&#x27;s photograph of Dorothy Dickson was used on the poster for an exhibition of his photographs at the National Portrait Gallery, London, as well as on the cover of the accompanying book.

<doc id="210596" wikidata="Q838966" url="?curid=210596" title="Irritable bowel syndrome">
<text>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by a group of symptoms that commonly include abdominal pain, abdominal bloating and changes in the consistency of bowel movements. These symptoms may occur over a long time, sometimes for years. IBS can negatively affect quality of life and may result in missed school or work or reduced productivity at work. Disorders such as anxiety, major depression, and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) are common among people with IBS.
The cause of IBS is not known but multiple factors have been proposed to lead to the condition. Theories include combinations of &quot;gut–brain axis&quot; problems, alterations in gut motility, visceral hypersensitivity, infections including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, neurotransmitters, genetic factors, and food sensitivity. Onset may be triggered by a stressful life event, or an intestinal infection. In the latter case, it is called post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome.

Diagnosis is based on symptoms in the absence of worrisome features and once other potential conditions have been ruled out. Worrisome or &quot;alarm&quot; features include onset at greater than 50 years of age, weight loss, blood in the stool, or a family history of inflammatory bowel disease. Other conditions that may present similarly include celiac disease, microscopic colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, bile acid malabsorption, and colon cancer.
Treatment of IBS is carried out to improve symptoms. This may include dietary changes, medication, probiotics, and counseling. Dietary measures include increasing soluble fiber intake, or a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs). The &quot;low FODMAP&quot; diet is meant for short to medium term use and is not intended as a life-long therapy. The medication loperamide may be used to help with diarrhea while laxatives may be used to help with constipation. There is strong clinical-trial evidence for the use of antidepressants, often in lower doses than that used for depression or anxiety, even in patients without comorbid mood disorder. Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline or nortriptyline and medications from the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) group may improve overall symptoms and reduce pain. Patient education and a good doctor–patient relationship are an important part of care.
About 10–15% of people in the developed world are believed to be affected by IBS. The prevalence varies according to country (from 1.1% to 45.0%) and criteria used to define IBS; however the average global prevalence is 11.2%. It is more common in South America and less common in Southeast Asia. In the Western world, it is twice as common in women as men and typically occurs before age 45. However, women in East Asia are not more likely than their male counterparts to have IBS, indicating much lower rates among East Asian women. Similarly, men from South America, South Asia and Africa are just as likely to have IBS as women in those regions, if not more so. The condition appears to become less common with age. IBS does not affect life expectancy or lead to other serious diseases. The first description of the condition was in 1820, while the current term &quot;irritable bowel syndrome&quot; came into use in 1944.
==Signs and symptoms==
The primary symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort in association with frequent diarrhea or constipation and a change in bowel habits. Symptoms usually are experienced as acute attacks that subside within one day, but recurrent attacks are likely. There may also be urgency for bowel movements, a feeling of incomplete evacuation (tenesmus) or bloating. In some cases, the symptoms are relieved by bowel movements.

People with IBS, more commonly than others, have gastroesophageal reflux, symptoms relating to the genitourinary system, fibromyalgia, headache, backache, and psychiatric symptoms such as depression, sleep disorders, and anxiety. About a third of adults who have IBS also report sexual dysfunction, typically in the form of a reduction in libido.

== Cause ==
While the causes of IBS are still unknown, it is believed that the entire gut–brain axis is affected. Recent findings suggest that an allergy triggered peripheral immune mechanism may underlie the symptoms associated with abdominal pain in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. IBS is more prevalent in obese patients.

=== Risk factors ===
People who are younger than 50, women, and those with a family history of the condition are more likely to develop IBS. Further risk factors are anxiety, depression, and stress. The risk of developing IBS increases six-fold after having a gastrointestinal infection (gastroenteritis). This is also called &quot;post-infectious IBS&quot;. The risk of developing IBS following an infection is further increased in those who also had a prolonged fever during the illness. Antibiotic use also appears to increase the risk of developing IBS. Genetic defects in innate immunity and epithelial homeostasis increase the risk of developing both post-infectious as well as other forms of IBS.

===Stress===
The role of the brain–gut axis in IBS has been suggested since the 1990s and childhood physical and psychological abuse is often associated with the development of IBS. It is believed that psychological stress may trigger IBS in predisposed individuals.

Given the high levels of anxiety experienced by people with IBS and the overlap with conditions such as fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome, a potential explanation for IBS involves a disruption of the stress system. The stress response in the body involves the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA) and the sympathetic nervous system, both of which have been shown to operate abnormally in people with IBS. Psychiatric illness or anxiety precedes IBS symptoms in two-thirds of people with IBS, and psychological traits predispose previously healthy people to developing IBS after gastroenteritis. Individuals with IBS also report high rates of sleep disturbances such as trouble falling asleep and frequent arousal throughout the night.

=== Gastroenteritis ===

Approximately 10 percent of IBS cases are triggered by an acute gastroenteritis infection. The CdtB toxin is produced by bacteria causing gastroenteritis and the host may develop an autoimmunity when host antibodies to CdtB cross-react with vinculin. Genetic defects relating to the innate immune system and epithelial barrier as well as high stress and anxiety levels appear to increase the risk of developing post-infectious IBS. Post-infectious IBS usually manifests itself as the diarrhea-predominant subtype. Evidence has demonstrated that the release of high levels of proinflammatory cytokines during acute enteric infection causes increased gut permeability leading to translocation of the commensal bacteria across the epithelial barrier; this in turn can result in significant damage to local tissues, which can develop into chronic gut abnormalities in sensitive individuals. However, increased gut permeability is strongly associated with IBS regardless of whether IBS was initiated by an infection or not. A link between small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and tropical sprue has been proposed to be involved as a cause of post-infectious IBS.

===Bacteria===

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) occurs with greater frequency in people who have been diagnosed with IBS compared to healthy controls. SIBO is most common in diarrhea-predominant IBS but also occurs in constipation-predominant IBS more frequently than healthy controls. Symptoms of SIBO include bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation among others. IBS may be the result of the immune system interacting abnormally with gut microbiota resulting in an abnormal cytokine signalling profile.

Certain bacteria are found in lower or higher abundance when compared with healthy individuals. Generally Bacteroidota, Bacillota, and Pseudomonadota are increased and Actinomycetota, &quot;Bifidobacteria&quot;, and &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; are decreased. Within the human gut, there are common phyla found. The most common is Bacillota. This includes &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;, which is found to have a decrease in people with IBS, and &quot;Streptococcus&quot;, which is shown to have an increase in abundance. Within this phylum, species in the class Clostridia are shown to have an increase, specifically &quot;Ruminococcus&quot; and &quot;Dorea&quot;. The family Lachnospiraceae presents an increase in IBS-D patients. The second most common phylum is Bacteroidota. In people with IBS, the Bacteroidota phylum has been shown to have an overall decrease, but an increase in the genus &quot;Bacteroides&quot;. IBS-D shows a decrease for the phylum Actinomycetota and an increase in Pseudomonadota, specifically in the family Enterobacteriaceae.

=== Gut microbiota ===

Alterations of gut microbiota (dysbiosis) are associated with the intestinal manifestations of IBS, but also with the psychiatric morbidity that coexists in up to 80% of people with IBS.

===Protozoa===
Protozoal infections can cause symptoms that mirror specific IBS subtypes, e.g., infection by certain substypes of &quot;Blastocystis hominis&quot; (blastocystosis). Many people regard these organisms as incidental findings, and unrelated to symptoms of IBS.

Blastocystis and &quot;Dientamoeba fragilis&quot; colonisation occurs more commonly in IBS affected individuals but their role in the condition is unclear.

===Vitamin D===
Vitamin D deficiency is more common in individuals affected by IBS. Vitamin D is involved in regulating triggers for IBS including the gut microbiome, inflammatory processes and immune responses, as well as psychosocial factors.

===Genetics===
&quot;SCN5A&quot; mutations are found in a small number of people who have IBS, particularly the constipation-predominant variant (IBS-C). The resulting defect leads to disruption in bowel function, by affecting the Nav1.5 channel, in smooth muscle of the colon and pacemaker cells.

==Mechanism==
Genetic, environmental, and psychological factors seem to be important in the development of IBS. The condition also has a genetic component even though there is a predominant influence of environmental factors.

Dysregulated brain-gut axis, abnormal serotonin/5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) metabolism, and high density of mucosal nerve fibers in the intestines have been implicated in the mechanisms of IBS. A number of 5-HT receptor subtypes were involved in the IBS symptoms, including 5-HT3, 5-HT4, and 5-HT7 receptors. High levels of 5-HT7 receptor-expressing mucosal nerve fibers were observed in the colon of IBS patients. A role of 5-HT7 receptor in intestinal hyperalgesia was demonstrated in mouse models with visceral hypersensitivity, of which a novel 5-HT7 receptor antagonist administered by mouth reduced intestinal pain levels.

Abnormalities occur in the gut flora of individuals who have IBS, such as reduced diversity, a decrease in bacteria belonging to the phylum Bacteroidota, and an increase in those belonging to the phylum Bacillota. The changes in gut flora are most profound in individuals who have diarrhoea-predominant IBS. Antibodies against common components (namely flagellin) of the commensal gut flora are a common occurrence in IBS affected individuals.

Chronic low-grade inflammation commonly occurs in IBS affected individuals with abnormalities found including increased enterochromaffin cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes, and mast cells resulting in chronic immune-mediated inflammation of the gut mucosa. IBS has been reported in greater quantities in multigenerational families with IBS than in the regular population. It is believed that psychological stress can induce increased inflammation and thereby cause IBS to develop in predisposed individuals.

==Diagnosis==
No specific laboratory or imaging tests can diagnose irritable bowel syndrome. Diagnosis should be based on symptoms, the exclusion of worrisome features, and the performance of specific investigations to rule out organic diseases that may present similar symptoms.

The recommendations for physicians are to minimize the use of medical investigations. The Rome criteria are typically used for diagnosis. They allow the diagnosis to be based only on symptoms, but no criteria based solely on symptoms is sufficiently accurate to diagnose IBS. Worrisome features include onset at greater than 50 years of age, weight loss, blood in the stool, iron-deficiency anemia, or a family history of colon cancer, celiac disease, or inflammatory bowel disease. The criteria for selecting tests and investigations also depends on the level of available medical resources.

The Rome IV criteria for diagnosing IBS include recurrent abdominal pain, on average, at least one day/week in the last three months, associated with additional stool- or defecation-related criteria. The algorithm may include additional tests to guard against misdiagnosis of other diseases as IBS. Such &quot;red flag&quot; symptoms that may indicate other diseases as well include weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, or nocturnal symptoms. However, red flag conditions may not always contribute to accuracy in diagnosis; for instance, as many as 31% of people with IBS have blood in their stool, many possibly from hemorrhoidal bleeding.

===Investigations===
Investigations are performed to exclude other conditions:
* Stool microscopy and culture (to exclude infectious conditions)
* Blood tests: full blood examination, liver function tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serological testing for coeliac disease
* Abdominal ultrasound (to exclude gallstones and other biliary tract diseases)
* Endoscopy and biopsies (to exclude peptic ulcer disease, coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and malignancies)
* Hydrogen breath testing (to exclude fructose and lactose malabsorption)

===Differential diagnosis===
Colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, thyroid disorders (hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism), and giardiasis can all feature abnormal defecation and abdominal pain. Less common causes of this symptom profile are carcinoid syndrome, microscopic colitis, bacterial overgrowth, and eosinophilic gastroenteritis; IBS is, however, a common presentation, and testing for these conditions would yield low numbers of positive results, so it is considered difficult to justify the expense. Conditions that may present similarly include celiac disease, bile acid malabsorption, colon cancer, and dyssynergic defecation.

Ruling out parasitic infections, lactose intolerance, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and celiac disease is recommended before a diagnosis of IBS is made. An upper endoscopy with small bowel biopsies is necessary to identify the presence of celiac disease. An ileocolonoscopy with biopsies is useful to exclude Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis (Inflammatory bowel disease).

Some people, managed for years for IBS, may have non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). Gastrointestinal symptoms of IBS are clinically indistinguishable from those of NCGS, but the presence of any of the following non-intestinal manifestations suggest a possible NCGS: headache or migraine, &quot;foggy mind&quot;, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, joint and muscle pain, leg or arm numbness, tingling of the extremities, dermatitis (eczema or skin rash), atopic disorders, allergy to one or more inhalants, foods or metals (such as mites, graminaceae, parietaria, cat or dog hair/dander, shellfish, or nickel), depression, anxiety, anemia, iron-deficiency anemia, folate deficiency, asthma, rhinitis, eating disorders, neuropsychiatric disorders (such as schizophrenia, autism, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) or autoimmune diseases. An improvement with a gluten-free diet of immune-mediated symptoms, including autoimmune diseases, once having reasonably ruled out celiac disease and wheat allergy, is another way to realize a differential diagnosis.

===Misdiagnosis===
People with IBS are at increased risk of being given inappropriate surgeries such as appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and hysterectomy due to being misdiagnosed as other medical conditions. Some common examples of misdiagnosis include infectious diseases, coeliac disease, &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, parasites (non-protozoal). The American College of Gastroenterology recommends all people with symptoms of IBS be tested for coeliac disease.

Bile acid malabsorption is also sometimes missed in people with diarrhea-predominant IBS. SeHCAT tests suggest around 30% of people with D-IBS have this condition, and most respond to bile acid sequestrants.

===Comorbidities===
Several medical conditions, or comorbidities, appear with greater frequency in people with IBS.
* Neurological/psychiatric: A study of 97,593 individuals with IBS identified comorbidities such as headache, fibromyalgia, and depression. IBS occurs in 51% of people with chronic fatigue syndrome and 49% of people with fibromyalgia, and psychiatric disorders occur in 94% of people with IBS.
* Channelopathy and muscular dystrophy: IBS and functional GI diseases are comorbidities of genetic channelopathies that cause cardiac conduction defects and neuromuscular dysfunction, and result also in alterations in GI motility, secretion, and sensation. Similarly, IBS and FBD are highly prevalent in myotonic muscle dystrophies. Digestive symptoms may be the first sign of dystrophic disease and may precede the musculo-skeletal features by up to 10 years.
* Inflammatory bowel disease: IBS may be marginally associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Researchers have found some correlation between IBS and IBD, noting that people with IBD experience IBS-like symptoms when their IBD is in remission. A three-year study found that patients diagnosed with IBS were 16.3 times more likely to be diagnosed with IBD during the study period, although this is likely due to an initial misdiagnosis.
* Abdominal surgery: People with IBS were at increased risk of having unnecessary gall bladder removal surgery not due to an increased risk of gallstones, but rather to abdominal pain, awareness of having gallstones, and inappropriate surgical indications. These people also are 87% more likely to undergo abdominal and pelvic surgery and three times more likely to undergo gallbladder surgery. Also, people with IBS were twice as likely to undergo hysterectomy.
* Endometriosis: One study reported a statistically significant link between migraine headaches, IBS, and endometriosis.
* Other chronic disorders: Interstitial cystitis may be associated with other chronic pain syndromes, such as irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia. The connection between these syndromes is unknown.

=== Classification ===
IBS can be classified as diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D), constipation-predominant (IBS-C), with mixed/alternating stool pattern (IBS-M/IBS-A) or pain-predominant. In some individuals, IBS may have an acute onset and develop after an infectious illness characterized by two or more of: fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or positive stool culture. This post-infective syndrome has consequently been termed &quot;post-infectious IBS&quot; (IBS-PI).

==Management==
A number of treatments have been found to be effective, including fiber, talk therapy, antispasmodic and antidepressant medication, and peppermint oil.

===Diet===
====FODMAP====

FODMAPs are short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed in the small intestine. A 2018 systematic review found that although there is evidence of improved IBS symptoms with a low-FODMAP diet, the evidence is of very low quality. Symptoms most likely to improve on this type of diet include urgency, flatulence, bloating, abdominal pain, and altered stool output. One national guideline advises a low FODMAP diet for managing IBS when other dietary and lifestyle measures have been unsuccessful. The diet restricts various carbohydrates which are poorly absorbed in the small intestine, as well as fructose and lactose, which are similarly poorly absorbed in those with intolerances to them. Reduction of fructose and fructan has been shown to reduce IBS symptoms in a dose-dependent manner in people with fructose malabsorption and IBS.

FODMAPs are fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols, which are poorly absorbed in the small intestine and subsequently fermented by the bacteria in the distal small and proximal large intestine. This is a normal phenomenon, common to everyone. The resultant production of gas potentially results in bloating and flatulence. Although FODMAPs can produce certain digestive discomfort in some people, not only do they not cause intestinal inflammation, but they help avoid it, because they produce beneficial alterations in the intestinal flora that contribute to maintaining the good health of the colon. FODMAPs are not the cause of irritable bowel syndrome nor other functional gastrointestinal disorders, but rather a person develops symptoms when the underlying bowel response is exaggerated or abnormal.

A low-FODMAP diet consists of restricting them from the diet. They are globally trimmed, rather than individually, which is more successful than for example restricting only fructose and fructans, which are also FODMAPs, as is recommended for those with fructose malabsorption.

A low-FODMAP diet might help to improve short-term digestive symptoms in adults with irritable bowel syndrome, but its long-term follow-up can have negative effects because it causes a detrimental impact on the gut microbiota and metabolome. It should only be used for short periods of time and under the advice of a specialist. A low-FODMAP diet is highly restrictive in various groups of nutrients and can be impractical to follow in the long-term. More studies are needed to assess the true impact of this diet on health.

In addition, the use of a low-FODMAP diet without verifying the diagnosis of IBS may result in misdiagnosis of other conditions such as celiac disease. Since the consumption of gluten is suppressed or reduced with a low-FODMAP diet, the improvement of the digestive symptoms with this diet may not be related to the withdrawal of the FODMAPs, but of gluten, indicating the presence of unrecognized celiac disease, avoiding its diagnosis and correct treatment, with the consequent risk of several serious health complications, including various types of cancer.

====Fiber====
Soluble fiber supplementation (e.g., psyllium/ispagula husk) may be effective in improving symptoms. However soluble fiber does not appear to reduce pain. It acts as a bulking agent, and for many people with IBS-D, allows for a more consistent stool. For people with IBS-C, it seems to allow for a softer, moister, more easily passable stool.

However, insoluble fiber (e.g., bran) is not effective for IBS. In some people, insoluble fiber supplementation may aggravate symptoms.

Fiber might be beneficial in those who have a predominance of constipation. In people who have IBS-C, soluble fiber can reduce overall symptoms but will not reduce pain. The research supporting dietary fiber contains conflicting small studies complicated by the heterogeneity of types of fiber and doses used.

=== Physical activity ===

Physical activity can have beneficial effects on irritable bowel syndrome. In light of this, the latest British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines on the management of IBS have stated that all patients with IBS should be advised to take regular exercise (strong recommendation, weak certainty evidence), whereas the American College of Gastroenterology guidelines have suggested with a lower certainty of evidence. Physical activity could significantly improve people’s adherence and, consequently, lead to a significant clinical benefit for symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.

===Medication===
Medications that may be useful include antispasmodics such as dicyclomine and antidepressants. Both H1-antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers have shown efficacy in reducing pain associated with visceral hypersensitivity in IBS.

====Serotonergic agents====
A number of 5-HT3 antagonists or 5-HT4 agonists were proposed clinically to treat diarrhea-predominant IBS and constipation-predominant IBS, respectively. However, severe side effects have resulted in its withdrawal by food and drug administration and are now prescribed under emergency investigational drug protocol. Other 5-HT receptor subtypes, such as 5-HT7 receptor, have yet to be developed.

====Laxatives====
For people who do not adequately respond to dietary fiber, osmotic laxatives such as polyethylene glycol, sorbitol, and lactulose can help avoid &quot;cathartic colon&quot; which has been associated with stimulant laxatives. Lubiprostone is a gastrointestinal agent used for the treatment of constipation-predominant IBS.

====Antispasmodics====
The use of antispasmodic drugs (e.g., anticholinergics such as hyoscyamine or dicyclomine) may help people who have cramps or diarrhea. A meta-analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration concludes that one out of seven people benefit from treatment with antispasmodics. Antispasmodics can be divided into two groups: neurotropics and musculotropics. Musculotropics, such as mebeverine, act directly at the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract, relieving spasm without affecting normal gut motility. Since this action is not mediated by the autonomic nervous system, the usual anticholinergic side effects are absent. The antispasmodic otilonium may also be useful.

====Discontinuation of proton pump inhibitors====
Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) used to suppress stomach acid production may cause small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) leading to IBS symptoms. Discontinuation of PPIs in selected individuals has been recommended as it may lead to an improvement or resolution of IBS symptoms.

====Antidepressants====
Evidence is conflicting about the benefit of antidepressants in IBS. Some meta-analyses have found a benefit, while others have not. There is good evidence that low doses of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can be effective for IBS. With TCAs, about one in three people improve.

However, the evidence is less robust for the effectiveness of other antidepressant classes such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants (SSRIs). Because of their serotonergic effect, SSRIs have been studied in IBS, especially for people who are constipation predominant. As of 2015, the evidence indicates that SSRIs do not help. Antidepressants are not effective for IBS in people with depression, possibly because lower doses of antidepressants than the doses used to treat depression are required for relief of IBS.

====Other agents====
Magnesium aluminum silicates and alverine citrate drugs can be effective for IBS.

Rifaximin may be useful as a treatment for IBS symptoms, including abdominal bloating and flatulence, although relief of abdominal distension is delayed. It is especially useful where small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is involved.

In individuals with IBS and low levels of vitamin D, supplementation is recommended. Some evidence suggests that vitamin D supplementation may improve symptoms of IBS, but further research is needed before it can be recommended as a specific treatment for IBS.

===Psychological therapies===
There is inconsistent evidence from studies with poor methodological quality that psychological therapies can be effective in the treatment of IBS. Preliminary research shows that psychotherapeutic interventions are correlated with reductions in both autonomic nervous system dysregulation and gastrointestinal symptoms. Reducing stress may also reduce the frequency and severity of IBS symptoms. Techniques that may be helpful include regular exercise, such as swimming, walking, or running.

=== Probiotics ===
Probiotics can be beneficial in the treatment of IBS; taking 10 billion to 100 billion beneficial bacteria per day is recommended for beneficial results. However, further research is needed on individual strains of beneficial bacteria for more refined recommendations. Probiotics have positive effects such as enhancing the intestinal mucosal barrier, providing a physical barrier, bacteriocin production (resulting in reduced numbers of pathogenic and gas-producing bacteria), reducing intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation, and regulating the immune system both locally and systemically among other beneficial effects. Probiotics may also have positive effects on the gut–brain axis by their positive effects countering the effects of stress on gut immunity and gut function.

A number of probiotics have been found to be effective, including &quot;Lactobacillus plantarum&quot;, and &quot;Bifidobacteria infantis&quot;; but one review found only &quot;Bifidobacteria infantis&quot; showed efficacy. &quot;B. infantis&quot; may have effects beyond the gut via it causing a reduction of proinflammatory cytokine activity and elevation of blood tryptophan levels, which may cause an improvement in symptoms of depression. Some yogurt is made using probiotics that may help ease symptoms of IBS. A probiotic yeast called &quot;Saccharomyces boulardii&quot; has some evidence of effectiveness in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.

Certain probiotics have different effects on certain symptoms of IBS. For example, &quot;Bifidobacterium breve&quot;, &quot;B. longum,&quot; and &quot;Lactobacillus acidophilus&quot; have been found to alleviate abdominal pain. &quot;B. breve, B. infantis, L. casei&quot;, or &quot;L. plantarum&quot; species alleviated distension symptoms. &quot;B. breve, B. infantis, L. casei, L. plantarum, B. longum, L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus&quot;, and &quot;Streptococcus salivarius&quot; ssp. &quot;thermophilus&quot; have all been found to affect flatulence levels. Most clinical studies show probiotics do not improve straining, sense of incomplete evacuation, stool consistency, fecal urgency, or stool frequency, although a few clinical studies did find some benefit of probiotic therapy. The evidence is conflicting for whether probiotics improve overall quality of life scores.

Probiotics may exert their beneficial effects on IBS symptoms via preserving the gut microbiota, normalisation of cytokine blood levels, improving the intestinal transit time, decreasing small intestine permeability, and by treating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth of fermenting bacteria. A fecal transplant does not appear useful as of 2019.

=== Herbal remedies ===
Peppermint oil appears useful. In a meta-analysis it was found to be superior to placebo for improvement of IBS symptoms, at least in the short term. An earlier meta-analysis suggested the results of peppermint oil were tentative as the number of people studied was small and blinding of those receiving treatment was unclear. Safety during pregnancy has not been established, however, and caution is required not to chew or break the enteric coating; otherwise, gastroesophageal reflux may occur as a result of lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. Occasionally, nausea and perianal burning occur as side effects. Iberogast, a multi-herbal extract, was found to be superior in efficacy to placebo. A comprehensive meta-analysis using twelve random trials resulted that the use of peppermint oil is an effective therapy for adults with irritable bowel syndrome.

Research into cannabinoids as treatment for IBS is limited. GI propulsion, secretion, and inflammation in the gut are all modulated by the ECS (Endocannabinoid system), providing a rationale for cannabinoids as treatment candidates for IBS.

Only limited evidence exists for the effectiveness of other herbal remedies for IBS. As with all herbs, it is wise to be aware of possible drug interactions and adverse effects.

===Alternative medicine===
There are no benefits of acupuncture compared to placebo for IBS symptom severity or IBS-related quality of life.

==Epidemiology==
The prevalence of IBS varies by country and by age range examined. The bar graph at right shows the percentage of the population reporting symptoms of IBS in studies from various geographic regions (see table below for references). The following table contains a list of studies performed in different countries that measured the prevalence of IBS and IBS-like symptoms:

===Gender===
In Western countries, women are around two to three times more likely to be diagnosed with IBS and four to five times more likely to seek specialty care for it than men. However, women in East Asian countries are not more likely than men to have irritable bowel syndrome, and there are conflicting reports about the female predominance of the disease in Africa and other parts of Asia. People diagnosed with IBS are usually younger than 45 years old. Studies of females with IBS show symptom severity often fluctuates with the menstrual cycle, suggesting hormonal differences may play a role. Endorsement of gender-related traits has been associated with quality of life and psychological adjustment in IBS. The increase in gastrointestinal symptoms during menses or early menopause may be related to declining or low estrogen and progesterone, suggesting that estrogen withdrawal may play a role in IBS. Gender differences in healthcare-seeking may also play a role. Gender differences in trait anxiety may contribute to lower pain thresholds in women, putting them at greater risk for a number of chronic pain disorders. Finally, sexual trauma is a major risk factor for IBS, as are other forms of abuse. Because women are at higher risk of sexual abuse than men, sex-related risk of abuse may contribute to the higher rate of IBS in women.

==History==
The concept of an &quot;irritable bowel&quot; was introduced by P. W. Brown, first in &quot;The Journal of the Kansas Medical Society&quot; in 1947 and later in the &quot;Rocky Mountain Medical Journal&quot; in 1950. The term was used to categorize people who developed symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and constipation, but where no well-recognized infective cause could be found. Early theories suggested the irritable bowel was caused by a psychosomatic or mental disorder.

==Society and culture==

===Economics===
====United States====
The aggregate cost of irritable bowel syndrome in the United States has been estimated at $1.7–10 billion in direct medical costs, with an additional $20 billion in indirect costs, for a total of $21.7–30 billion. A study by a managed care company comparing medical costs for people with IBS to non-IBS controls identified a 49% annual increase in medical costs associated with a diagnosis of IBS. People with IBS incurred average annual direct costs of $5,049 and $406 in out-of-pocket expenses in 2007. A study of workers with IBS found that they reported a 34.6% loss in productivity, corresponding to 13.8 hours lost per 40 hour week. A study of employer-related health costs from a Fortune 100 company conducted with data from the 1990s found people with IBS incurred US$4527 in claims costs vs. $3276 for controls. A study on Medicaid costs conducted in 2003 by the University of Georgia College of Pharmacy and Novartis found IBS was associated in an increase of $962 in Medicaid costs in California, and $2191 in North Carolina. People with IBS had higher costs for physician visits, outpatients visits, and prescription drugs. The study suggested the costs associated with IBS were comparable to those found for people with asthma.

==Research==
Individuals with IBS have been found to have decreased diversity and numbers of Bacteroidota microbiota. Preliminary research into the effectiveness of fecal microbiota transplant in the treatment of IBS has been very favourable with a &#x27;cure&#x27; rate of between 36 percent and 60 percent with remission of core IBS symptoms persisting at 9 and 19 months follow up. Treatment with probiotic strains of bacteria has shown to be effective, though not all strains of microorganisms confer the same benefit and adverse side effects have been documented in a minority of cases.

There is increasing evidence for the effectiveness of mesalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid) in the treatment of IBS. Mesalazine is a drug with anti-inflammatory properties that has been reported to significantly reduce immune mediated inflammation in the gut of IBS affected individuals with mesalazine therapy resulting in improved IBS symptoms as well as feelings of general wellness in IBS affected people. It has also been observed that mesalazine therapy helps to normalise the gut flora which is often abnormal in people who have IBS. The therapeutic benefits of mesalazine may be the result of improvements to the epithelial barrier function. Treatment based on &quot;abnormally&quot; high IgG antibodies cannot be recommended.

Differences in visceral sensitivity and intestinal physiology have been noted in IBS. Mucosal barrier reinforcement in response to oral 5-HTP was absent in IBS compared to controls. IBS/IBD individuals are less often HLA DQ2/8 positive than in upper functional gastrointestinal disease and healthy populations.

Efficacy of mast cell directed therapies in irritable bowel syndrome is an area of ongoing research.

== In other species ==
A similar syndrome is found in rats (&quot;Rattus&quot; spp.). In rats a short-chain fatty acid receptor is involved, a free fatty acid receptor 2 subtype that is expressed in both enteroendocrine cells and mucosal mast cells. These cells then respond in an exaggerated way to the IBS rat&#x27;s own large quantity of maldigestion products.

<text>Robert Hutchings Goddard (October 5, 1882 – August 10, 1945) was an American engineer, professor, physicist, and inventor who is credited with creating and building the world&#x27;s first liquid-fueled rocket, which was successfully launched on March 16, 1926. By 1915 his pioneering work had dramatically improved the efficiency of the solid-fueled rocket, signaling the era of the modern rocket and innovation. He and his team launched 34 rockets between 1926 and 1941, achieving altitudes as high as and speeds as fast as 885 km/h (550 mph). 

Goddard&#x27;s work as both theorist and engineer anticipated many of the developments that would make spaceflight possible. He has been called the man who ushered in the Space Age. Two of Goddard&#x27;s 214 patented inventions, a multi-stage rocket (1914), and a liquid-fuel rocket (1914), were important milestones toward spaceflight. His 1919 monograph &quot;A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes&quot; is considered one of the classic texts of 20th-century rocket science. Goddard successfully pioneered modern methods such as two-axis control (gyroscopes and steerable thrust) to allow rockets to control their flight effectively.

Although his work in the field was revolutionary, Goddard received little public or financial support for his research and development work. He was a shy person, and rocket research was not considered a suitable pursuit for a physics professor. The press and other scientists ridiculed his theories of spaceflight. As a result, he became protective of his privacy and his work.

Years after his death, at the dawn of the Space Age, Goddard came to be recognized as one of the founding fathers of modern rocketry, along with Robert Esnault-Pelterie, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and Hermann Oberth. He not only recognized early on the potential of rockets for atmospheric research, ballistic missiles and space travel but also was the first to scientifically study, design, construct and fly the precursory rockets needed to eventually implement those ideas.

NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center was named in Goddard&#x27;s honor in 1959. He was also inducted into the International Aerospace Hall of Fame and National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1966, and the International Space Hall of Fame in 1976.

== Early life and inspiration ==

Goddard was born in Worcester, Massachusetts to Nahum Danford Goddard (1859–1928) and Fannie Louise Hoyt (1864–1920). Robert was their only child to survive; a younger son, Richard Henry, was born with a spinal deformity and died before his first birthday. His father Nahum was employed by manufacturers, and he invented several useful tools. Goddard had English paternal family roots in New England with William Goddard (1628–91) a London grocer who settled in Watertown, Massachusetts in 1666. This line of Goddards were previously called Goddardville. On his maternal side he was descended from John Hoyt and other settlers of Massachusetts in the late 1600s.
Shortly after his birth, the family moved to Boston. With a curiosity about nature, he studied the heavens using a telescope from his father and observed the birds flying. Essentially a country boy, he loved the outdoors and hiking with his father on trips to Worcester and became an excellent marksman with a rifle. In 1898, his mother contracted tuberculosis and they moved back to Worcester for the clear air. On Sundays, the family attended the Episcopal church, and Robert sang in the choir.

=== Childhood experiments ===

With the electrification of American cities in the 1880s, the young Goddard became interested in science—specifically, engineering and technology. When his father showed him how to generate static electricity on the family&#x27;s carpet, the five-year-old&#x27;s imagination was sparked. Robert experimented, believing he could jump higher if the zinc from a battery could be charged by scuffing his feet on the gravel walk. But, holding the zinc, he could jump no higher than usual. Goddard halted the experiments after a warning from his mother that if he succeeded, he could &quot;go sailing away and might not be able to come back.&quot;
He experimented with chemicals and created a cloud of smoke and an explosion in the house.
Goddard&#x27;s father further encouraged Robert&#x27;s scientific interest by providing him with a telescope, a microscope, and a subscription to &quot;Scientific American&quot;. Robert developed a fascination with flight, first with kites and then with balloons. He became a thorough diarist and documenter of his work—a skill that would greatly benefit his later career. These interests merged at age 16, when Goddard attempted to construct a balloon out of aluminum, shaping the raw metal in his home workshop, and filling it with hydrogen. After nearly five weeks of methodical, documented efforts, he finally abandoned the project, remarking, &quot;... balloon will not go up. ... Aluminum is too heavy. Failior crowns enterprise.&quot; However, the lesson of this failure did not restrain Goddard&#x27;s growing determination and confidence in his work. He wrote in 1927, &quot;I imagine an innate interest in mechanical things was inherited from a number of ancestors who were machinists.&quot;

===Cherry tree dream===
He became interested in space when he read H. G. Wells&#x27; science fiction classic &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; at 16 years old. His dedication to pursuing space flight became fixed on October 19, 1899. The 17-year-old Goddard climbed a cherry tree to cut off dead limbs. He was transfixed by the sky, and his imagination grew. He later wrote:

For the rest of his life, he observed October 19 as &quot;Anniversary Day&quot;, a private commemoration of the day of his greatest inspiration.

== Education and early studies ==

The young Goddard was a thin and frail boy, almost always in fragile health. He suffered from stomach problems, pleurisy, colds, and bronchitis, and he fell two years behind his classmates. He became a voracious reader, regularly visiting the local public library to borrow books on the physical sciences.

===Aerodynamics and motion===

Goddard&#x27;s interest in aerodynamics led him to study some of Samuel Langley&#x27;s scientific papers in the periodical &quot;Smithsonian&quot;. In these papers, Langley wrote that birds flap their wings with different force on each side to turn in the air. Inspired by these articles, the teenage Goddard watched swallows and chimney swifts from the porch of his home, noting how subtly the birds moved their wings to control their flight. He noted how remarkably the birds controlled their flight with their tail feathers, which he called the birds&#x27; equivalent of ailerons. He took exception to some of Langley&#x27;s conclusions and in 1901 wrote a letter to &quot;St. Nicholas&quot; magazine with his own ideas. The editor of &quot;St. Nicholas&quot; declined to publish Goddard&#x27;s letter, remarking that birds fly with a certain amount of intelligence and that &quot;machines will not act with such intelligence.&quot; Goddard disagreed, believing that a man could control a flying machine with his own intelligence.

Around this time, Goddard read Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, and found that Newton&#x27;s Third Law of Motion applied to motion in space. He wrote later about his own tests of the Law:

===Academics===
As his health improved, Goddard continued his formal schooling as a 19-year-old sophomore at South High Community School in Worcester in 1901. He excelled in his coursework, and his peers twice elected him class president. Making up for lost time, he studied books on mathematics, astronomy, mechanics and composition from the school library. At his graduation ceremony in 1904, he gave his class oration as valedictorian. In his speech, entitled &quot;On Taking Things for Granted&quot;, Goddard included a section that would become emblematic of his life:

[J]ust as in the sciences we have learned that we are too ignorant to safely pronounce anything impossible, so for the individual, since we cannot know just what are his limitations, we can hardly say with certainty that anything is necessarily within or beyond his grasp. Each must remember that no one can predict to what heights of wealth, fame, or usefulness he may rise until he has honestly endeavored, and he should derive courage from the fact that all sciences have been, at some time, in the same condition as he, and that it has often proved true that the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow.

Goddard enrolled at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1904. He quickly impressed the head of the physics department, A. Wilmer Duff, with his thirst for knowledge, and Duff took him on as a laboratory assistant and tutor. At WPI, Goddard joined the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and began a long courtship with high school classmate Miriam Olmstead, an honor student who had graduated with him as salutatorian. Eventually, she and Goddard were engaged, but they drifted apart and ended the engagement around 1909.

Goddard received his B.S. degree in physics from Worcester Polytechnic in 1908, and after serving there for a year as an instructor in physics, he began his graduate studies at Clark University in Worcester in the fall of 1909. While studying at Clark, Goddard continued working in Salisbury Labs at WPI and anecdotally caused a damaging explosion, whereupon his work was moved to the Magnetic Lab (today called Skull Tomb).

Goddard received his M.A. degree in physics from Clark University in 1910, and then stayed at Clark to complete his Ph.D. in physics in 1911. He spent another year at Clark as an honorary fellow in physics, and in 1912 he accepted a research fellowship at Princeton University&#x27;s Palmer Physical Laboratory.

===First scientific writings===
The high school student summed up his ideas on space travel in a proposed article, &quot;The Navigation of Space,&quot; which he submitted to the &quot;Popular Science News&quot;. The journal&#x27;s editor returned it, saying that they could not use it &quot;in the near future.&quot;

While still an undergraduate, Goddard wrote a paper proposing a method for balancing airplanes using gyro-stabilization. He submitted the idea to &quot;Scientific American&quot;, which published the paper in 1907. Goddard later wrote in his diaries that he believed his paper was the first proposal of a way to automatically stabilize aircraft in flight. His proposal came around the same time as other scientists were making breakthroughs in developing functional gyroscopes.

While studying physics at WPI, ideas came to Goddard&#x27;s mind that sometimes seemed impossible, but he was compelled to record them for future investigation. He wrote that &quot;there was something inside which simply would not stop working.&quot; He purchased some cloth-covered notebooks and began filling them with a variety of thoughts, mostly concerning his dream of space travel. He considered centrifugal force, radio waves, magnetic reaction, solar energy, atomic energy, ion or electrostatic propulsion and other methods to reach space. After experimenting with solid fuel rockets he was convinced by 1909 that chemical-propellant engines were the answer. A particularly complex concept was set down in June 1908: Sending a camera around distant planets, guided by measurements of gravity along the trajectory, and returning to earth.

His first writing on the possibility of a liquid-fueled rocket came on February 2, 1909. Goddard had begun to study ways of increasing a rocket&#x27;s efficiency using methods differing from conventional solid-fuel rockets. He wrote in his notebook about using liquid hydrogen as a fuel with liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. He believed that 50 percent efficiency could be achieved with these liquid propellants (i.e., half of the heat energy of combustion converted to the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases).

==First patents==
In the decades around 1910, radio was a new technology, fertile for innovation. In 1912, while working at Princeton University, Goddard investigated the effects of radio waves on insulators. In order to generate radio-frequency power, he invented a vacuum tube with a beam deflection that operated like a cathode-ray oscillator tube. His patent on this tube, which predated that of Lee De Forest, became central in the suit between Arthur A. Collins, whose small company made radio transmitter tubes, and AT&amp;T and RCA over his use of vacuum tube technology. Goddard accepted only a consultant&#x27;s fee from Collins when the suit was dropped. Eventually, the two big companies allowed the country&#x27;s growing electronics industry to use the De Forest patents freely.

===Rocket math===
By 1912 he had in his spare time, using calculus, developed the mathematics which allowed him to calculate the position and velocity of a rocket in vertical flight, given the weight of the rocket and weight of the propellant and the velocity (with respect to the rocket frame) of the exhaust gases. In effect he had independently developed the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation published a decade earlier in Russia. Tsiolkovsky, however, did not account for gravity nor drag. For vertical flight from the surface of Earth Goddard included in his differential equation the effects of gravity and aerodynamic drag. He wrote: &quot;An approximate method was found necessary ... in order to avoid an unsolved problem in the calculus of variations. The solution that was obtained revealed the fact that surprisingly small initial masses would be necessary ... &quot;provided the gases were ejected from the rocket at a high velocity,&quot; and also provided that &quot;most of the rocket consisted of propellant material.&quot;&quot;

His first goal was to build a sounding rocket with which to study the atmosphere. Not only would such investigation aid meteorology, but it was necessary to determine temperature, density and wind speed as functions of altitude in order to design efficient space launch vehicles. He was very reluctant to admit that his ultimate goal was, in fact, to develop a vehicle for flights into space, since most scientists, especially in the United States, did not consider such a goal to be a realistic or practical scientific pursuit, nor was the public yet ready to seriously consider such ideas. Later, in 1933, Goddard said that &quot;[I]n no case must we allow ourselves to be deterred from the achievement of space travel, test by test and step by step, until one day we succeed, cost what it may.&quot;

===Illness===
In early 1913, Goddard became seriously ill with tuberculosis and had to leave his position at Princeton. He then returned to Worcester, where he began a prolonged process of recovery at home. His doctors did not expect him to live. He decided he should spend time outside in the fresh air and walk for exercise, and he gradually improved. When his nurse discovered some of his notes in his bed, he kept them, arguing, &quot;I have to live to do this work.&quot;

It was during this period of recuperation, however, that Goddard began to produce some of his most important work. As his symptoms subsided, he allowed himself to work an hour per day with his notes made at Princeton. He was afraid that nobody would be able to read his scribbling should he
succumb.

===Foundational patents===
In the technological and manufacturing atmosphere of Worcester, patents were considered essential, not only to protect original work but as documentation of first discovery. He began to see the importance of his ideas as intellectual property, and thus began to secure those ideas before someone else did—and he would have to pay to use them. In May 1913, he wrote descriptions concerning his first rocket patent applications. His father brought them to a patent lawyer in Worcester who helped him to refine his ideas for consideration. Goddard&#x27;s first patent application was submitted in October 1913.

In 1914, his first two landmark patents were accepted and registered. The first, , described a multi-stage rocket fueled with a solid &quot;explosive material.&quot; The second, , described a rocket fueled with a solid fuel (explosive material) or with liquid propellants (gasoline and liquid nitrous oxide). The two patents would eventually become important milestones in the history of rocketry. Overall, 214 patents were published, some posthumously by his wife.

== Early rocketry research ==

In the fall of 1914 Goddard&#x27;s health had improved, and he accepted a part-time position as an instructor and research fellow at Clark University. His position at Clark allowed him to further his rocketry research. He ordered numerous supplies that could be used to build rocket prototypes for launch and spent much of 1915 in preparation for his first tests. Goddard&#x27;s first test launch of a powder rocket came on an early evening in 1915 following his daytime classes at Clark. The launch was loud and bright enough to arouse the alarm of the campus janitor, and Goddard had to reassure him that his experiments, while being serious study, were also quite harmless. After this incident Goddard took his experiments inside the physics lab in order to limit any disturbance.

At the Clark physics lab Goddard conducted static tests of powder rockets to measure their thrust and efficiency. He found his earlier estimates to be verified; powder rockets were converting only about two percent of the thermal energy in their fuel into thrust and kinetic energy. At this point he applied de Laval nozzles, which were generally used with steam turbine engines, and these greatly improved efficiency. (Of the several definitions of rocket efficiency, Goddard measured in his laboratory what is today called the &quot;internal efficiency&quot; of the engine: the ratio of the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases to the available thermal energy of combustion, expressed as a percentage.) By mid-summer of 1915 Goddard had obtained an average efficiency of 40 percent with a nozzle exit velocity of . Connecting a combustion chamber full of gunpowder to various converging-diverging expansion (de Laval) nozzles, Goddard was able in static tests to achieve engine efficiencies of more than 63% and exhaust velocities of over 7,000 feet (2,134 meters) per second.

Few would recognize it at the time, but this little engine was a major breakthrough. These experiments suggested that rockets could be made powerful enough to escape Earth and travel into space. This engine and subsequent experiments sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution were the beginning of modern rocketry and, ultimately, space exploration. Goddard realized, however, that it would take the more efficient liquid propellants to reach space.

Later that year, Goddard designed an elaborate experiment at the Clark physics lab and proved that a rocket would perform in a vacuum such as that in space. He believed it would, but many other scientists were not yet convinced. His experiment demonstrated that a rocket&#x27;s performance actually decreases under atmospheric pressure.

In September 1906 he wrote in his notebook about using the repulsion of electrically charged particles (ions) to produce thrust. From 1916 to 1917, Goddard built and tested the first known experimental ion thrusters, which he thought might be used for propulsion in the near-vacuum conditions of outer space. The small glass engines he built were tested at atmospheric pressure, where they generated a stream of ionized air.

===Smithsonian Institution sponsorship===
By 1916, the cost of Goddard&#x27;s rocket research had become too great for his modest teaching salary to bear. He began to solicit potential sponsors for financial assistance, beginning with the Smithsonian Institution, the National Geographic Society, and the Aero Club of America.

In his letter to the Smithsonian in September 1916, Goddard claimed he had achieved a 63% efficiency and a nozzle velocity of almost . With these performance levels, he believed a rocket could vertically lift a weight of to a height of with an initial launch weight of only . (Earth&#x27;s atmosphere can be considered to end at altitude, where its drag effect on orbiting satellites becomes minimal.)

The Smithsonian was interested and asked Goddard to elaborate upon his initial inquiry. Goddard responded with a detailed manuscript he had already prepared, entitled &quot;A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes&quot;.

In January 1917, the Smithsonian agreed to provide Goddard with a five-year grant totaling . Afterward, Clark was able to contribute and the use of their physics lab to the project. Worcester Polytechnic Institute also allowed him to use its abandoned Magnetics Laboratory on the edge of campus during this time, as a safe place for testing. WPI also made some parts in their machine shop.

Goddard&#x27;s fellow Clark scientists were astonished at the unusually large Smithsonian grant for rocket research, which they thought was not real science. Decades later, rocket scientists who knew how much it cost to research and develop rockets said that he had received little financial support.

Two years later, at the insistence of Arthur G. Webster, the world-renowned head of Clark&#x27;s physics department, Goddard arranged for the Smithsonian to publish the paper, &quot;A Method...,&quot; which documented his work.

While at Clark University, Goddard did research into solar power using a parabolic dish to concentrate the Sun&#x27;s rays on a machined piece of quartz, that was sprayed with mercury, which then heated water and drove an electric generator. Goddard believed his invention had overcome all the obstacles that had previously defeated other scientists and inventors, and he had his findings published in the November 1929 issue of &quot;Popular Science&quot;.

===Goddard&#x27;s military rocket===

Not all of Goddard&#x27;s early work was geared toward space travel. As the United States entered World War I in 1917, the country&#x27;s universities began to lend their services to the war effort. Goddard believed his rocket research could be applied to many different military applications, including mobile artillery, field weapons and naval torpedoes. He made proposals to the Navy and Army. No record exists in his papers of any interest by the Navy to Goddard&#x27;s inquiry. However, Army Ordnance was quite interested, and Goddard met several times with Army personnel.

During this time, Goddard was also contacted, in early 1918, by a civilian industrialist in Worcester about the possibility of manufacturing rockets for the military. However, as the businessman&#x27;s enthusiasm grew, so did Goddard&#x27;s suspicion. Talks eventually broke down as Goddard began to fear his work might be appropriated by the business. However, an Army Signal Corps officer tried to make Goddard cooperate, but he was called off by General George Squier of the Signal Corps who had been contacted by Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Charles Walcott. Goddard became leery of working with corporations and was careful to secure patents to &quot;protect his ideas.&quot; These events led to the Signal Corps sponsoring Goddard&#x27;s work during World War I.

Goddard proposed to the Army an idea for a tube-based rocket launcher as a light infantry weapon. The launcher concept became the precursor to the bazooka. The rocket-powered, recoil-free weapon was the brainchild of Goddard as a side project (under Army contract) of his work on rocket propulsion. Goddard, during his tenure at Clark University, and working at Mount Wilson Observatory for security reasons, designed the tube-fired rocket for military use during World War I. He and his co-worker Clarence N. Hickman successfully demonstrated his rocket to the U.S. Army Signal Corps at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, on November 6, 1918, using two music stands for a launch platform. The Army was impressed, but the Compiègne Armistice was signed only five days later, and further development was discontinued as World War I ended.

The delay in the development of the bazooka and other weapons was a result of the long recovery period required from Goddard&#x27;s serious bout with tuberculosis. Goddard continued to be a part-time consultant to the U.S. Government at Indian Head, Maryland, until 1923, but his focus had turned to other research involving rocket propulsion, including work with liquid fuels and liquid oxygen.

Later, the former Clark University researcher Clarence N. Hickman and Army officers Col. Leslie Skinner and Lt. Edward Uhl continued Goddard&#x27;s work on the bazooka. A shaped-charge warhead was attached to the rocket, leading to the tank-killing weapon used in World War II and to many other powerful rocket weapons.

== &quot;A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes&quot; ==

In 1919 Goddard thought that it would be premature to disclose the results of his experiments because his engine was not sufficiently developed. Webster realized that Goddard had accomplished a good deal of fine work and insisted that Goddard publish his progress so far or he would take care of it himself, so Goddard asked the Smithsonian Institution if it would publish the report, updated with notes, that he had submitted in late 1916.

In late 1919, the Smithsonian published Goddard&#x27;s groundbreaking work, &quot;A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes&quot;. The report describes Goddard&#x27;s mathematical theories of rocket flight, his experiments with solid-fuel rockets, and the possibilities he saw of exploring Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and beyond. Along with Konstantin Tsiolkovsky&#x27;s earlier work, &quot;The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices&quot;, Goddard&#x27;s report is regarded as one of the pioneering works of the science of rocketry, and 1750 copies were distributed worldwide. Goddard also sent a copy to individuals who requested one, until his personal supply was exhausted. Smithsonian aerospace historian Frank Winter said that this paper was &quot;one of the key catalysts behind the international rocket movement of the 1920s and 30s.&quot;

Goddard described extensive experiments with solid-fuel rocket engines burning high-grade nitrocellulose smokeless powder. A critical breakthrough was the use of the steam turbine nozzle invented by the Swedish inventor Gustaf de Laval. The de Laval nozzle allows the most efficient (isentropic) conversion of the energy of hot gases into forward motion. By means of this nozzle, Goddard increased the efficiency of his rocket engines from two percent to 64 percent and obtained supersonic exhaust velocities of over Mach 7.

Though most of this work dealt with the theoretical and experimental relations between propellant, rocket mass, thrust, and velocity, a final section, entitled &quot;Calculation of minimum mass required to raise one pound to an &#x27;infinite&#x27; altitude,&quot; discussed the possible uses of rockets, not only to reach the upper atmosphere but to escape from Earth&#x27;s gravitation altogether. He determined, using an approximate method to solve his differential equation of motion for vertical flight, that a rocket with an effective exhaust velocity (see specific impulse) of 7000 feet per second and an initial weight of 602 pounds would be able to send a one-pound payload to an infinite height. Included as a thought experiment was the idea of launching a rocket to the Moon and igniting a mass of flash powder on its surface, so as to be visible through a telescope. He discussed the matter seriously, down to an estimate of the amount of powder required. Goddard&#x27;s conclusion was that a rocket with starting mass of 3.21 tons could produce a flash &quot;just visible&quot; from Earth, assuming a final payload weight of 10.7 pounds.

Goddard eschewed publicity, because he did not have time to reply to criticism of his work, and his imaginative ideas about space travel were shared only with private groups he trusted. He did, though, publish and talk about the rocket principle and sounding rockets, since these subjects were not too &quot;far out.&quot; In a letter to the Smithsonian, dated March 1920, he discussed: photographing the Moon and planets from rocket-powered fly-by probes, sending messages to distant civilizations on inscribed metal plates, the use of solar energy in space, and the idea of high-velocity ion propulsion. In that same letter, Goddard clearly describes the concept of the ablative heat shield, suggesting the landing apparatus be covered with &quot;layers of a very infusible hard substance with layers of a poor heat conductor between&quot; designed to erode in the same way as the surface of a meteor.

===Publicity and criticism===
The publication of Goddard&#x27;s document gained him national attention from U.S. newspapers, most of it negative. Although Goddard&#x27;s discussion of targeting the moon was only a small part of the work as a whole (eight lines on the next to last page of 69 pages), and was intended as an illustration of the possibilities rather than a declaration of intent, the papers sensationalized his ideas to the point of misrepresentation and ridicule. Even the Smithsonian had to abstain from publicity because of the amount of ridiculous correspondence received from the general public. David Lasser, who co-founded the American Rocket Society (ARS), wrote in 1931 that Goddard was subjected in the press to the &quot;most violent attacks.&quot;

On January 12, 1920, a front-page story in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Believes Rocket Can Reach Moon&quot;, reported a Smithsonian press release about a &quot;multiple-charge, high-efficiency rocket.&quot; The chief application envisaged was &quot;the possibility of sending recording apparatus to moderate and extreme altitudes within the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere&quot;, the advantage over balloon-carried instruments being ease of recovery, since &quot;the new rocket apparatus would go straight up and come straight down.&quot; But it also mentioned a proposal &quot;to [send] to the dark part of the new moon a sufficiently large amount of the most brilliant flash powder which, in being ignited on impact, would be plainly visible in a powerful telescope. This would be the only way of proving that the rocket had really left the attraction of the earth, as the apparatus would never come back, once it had escaped that attraction.&quot;

====&quot;New York Times&quot; editorial====
On January 13, 1920, the day after its front-page story about Goddard&#x27;s rocket, an unsigned &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial, in a section entitled &quot;Topics of the Times&quot;, scoffed at the proposal. The article, which bore the title &quot;A Severe Strain on Credulity&quot;, began with apparent approval, but soon went on to cast serious doubt:

As a method of sending a missile to the higher, and even highest, part of the earth&#x27;s atmospheric envelope, Professor Goddard&#x27;s multiple-charge rocket is a practicable, and therefore promising device. Such a rocket, too, might carry self-recording instruments, to be released at the limit of its flight, and conceivable parachutes would bring them safely to the ground. It is not obvious, however, that the instruments would return to the point of departure; indeed, it is obvious that they would not, for parachutes drift exactly as balloons do.

The article pressed further on Goddard&#x27;s proposal to launch rockets beyond the atmosphere:

[A]fter the rocket quits our air and really starts on its longer journey, its flight would be neither accelerated nor maintained by the explosion of the charges it then might have left. To claim that it would be is to deny a fundamental law of dynamics, and only Dr. Einstein and his chosen dozen, so few and fit, are licensed to do that. ... Of course, [Goddard] only seems to lack the knowledge ladled out daily in high schools.

Thrust is however possible in a vacuum.

====Aftermath====
A week after the &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial, Goddard released a signed statement to the Associated Press, attempting to restore reason to what had become a sensational story:

Too much attention has been concentrated on the proposed flash pow[d]er experiment, and too little on the exploration of the atmosphere. ... Whatever interesting possibilities there may be of the method that has been proposed, other than the purpose for which it was intended, no one of them could be undertaken without first exploring the atmosphere.

In 1924, Goddard published an article, &quot;How my speed rocket can propel itself in vacuum&quot;, in &quot;Popular Science&quot;, in which he explained the physics and gave details of the vacuum experiments he had performed to prove the theory. But, no matter how he tried to explain his results, he was not understood by the majority. After one of Goddard&#x27;s experiments in 1929, a local Worcester newspaper carried the mocking headline &quot;Moon rocket misses target by 238,799 miles.&quot;

Though the unimaginative public chuckled at the &quot;moon man,&quot; his groundbreaking paper was read seriously by many rocketeers in America, Europe, and Russia who were stirred to build their own rockets. This work was his most important contribution to the quest to &quot;aim for the stars.&quot;

Goddard worked alone with just his team of mechanics and machinists for many years. This was a result of the harsh criticism from the media and other scientists, and his understanding of the military applications which foreign powers might use. Goddard became increasingly suspicious of others and often worked alone, except during the two World Wars, which limited the impact of much of his work. Another limiting factor was the lack of support from the American government, military and academia, all failing to understand the value of the rocket to study the atmosphere and near space, and for military applications.

Nevertheless, Goddard had some influence and was influenced by European rocketry pioneers like Hermann Oberth and his student Max Valier, at least as proponent of the idea of space rocketry and source of inspiration, although each side developed their technology and its scientific basis independently. In Europe the rocketeers were mainly theorists and visionaries. Goddard was the foremost experimenter, and his report was responsible for encouraging many to build their own rockets.

As Germany became ever more war-like, Goddard refused to communicate with German rocket experimenters, though he received more and more of their correspondence. Oberth had Goddard&#x27;s 1919 paper translated and Wernher von Braun read it. They therefore knew that efficiencies at least thirty times greater than conventional rockets were achievable with Goddard&#x27;s engine design. Via von Braun and his team joining the US post-war programs there is thus an indirect line of scientific and technology tradition from NASA back to Goddard.

====&quot;A Correction&quot;====
Forty-nine years after its editorial mocking Goddard, on July 17, 1969—the day after the launch of Apollo 11—&quot;The New York Times&quot; published a short item under the headline &quot;A Correction&quot;. The three-paragraph statement summarized its 1920 editorial and concluded:

Further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of Isaac Newton in the 17th Century and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere. The &quot;Times&quot; regrets the error.

==First liquid-fueled flight==

Goddard began considering liquid propellants, including hydrogen and oxygen, as early as 1909. He knew that hydrogen and oxygen was the most efficient fuel/oxidizer combination. Liquid hydrogen was not readily available in 1921, however, and he selected gasoline as the safest fuel to handle.

===First static tests===

Goddard began experimenting with liquid oxidizer, liquid fuel rockets in September 1921, and successfully tested the first liquid propellant engine in November 1923. It had a cylindrical combustion chamber, using impinging jets to mix and atomize liquid oxygen and gasoline.

In 1924–25, Goddard had problems developing a high-pressure piston pump to send fuel to the combustion chamber. He wanted to scale up the experiments, but his funding would not allow such growth. He decided to forgo the pumps and use a pressurized fuel feed system applying pressure to the fuel tank from a tank of inert gas, a technique that is still used today. The liquid oxygen, some of which evaporated, provided its own pressure.

On December 6, 1925, he tested the simpler pressure feed system. He conducted a static test on the firing stand at the Clark University physics laboratory. The engine successfully lifted its own weight in a 27-second test in the static rack. It was a major success for Goddard, proving that a liquid fuel rocket was possible. The test moved Goddard an important step closer to launching a rocket with liquid fuel.

Goddard conducted an additional test in December, and two more in January 1926. After that, he began preparing for a possible launch of the rocket system.

===First flight===
Goddard launched the world&#x27;s first liquid-fueled (gasoline and liquid oxygen) rocket on March 16, 1926, in Auburn, Massachusetts. Present at the launch were his crew chief Henry Sachs, Esther Goddard, and Percy Roope, who was Clark&#x27;s assistant professor in the physics department. Goddard&#x27;s diary entry of the event was notable for its understatement:

March 16. Went to Auburn with S[achs] in am. E[sther] and Mr. Roope came out at 1 p.m. Tried rocket at 2.30. It rose 41 feet &amp; went 184 feet, in 2.5 secs., after the lower half of the nozzle burned off. Brought materials to lab. ...

His diary entry the next day elaborated:

March 17, 1926. The first flight with a rocket using liquid propellants was made yesterday at Aunt Effie&#x27;s farm in Auburn. ... Even though the release was pulled, the rocket did not rise at first, but the flame came out, and there was a steady roar. After a number of seconds it rose, slowly until it cleared the frame, and then at express train speed, curving over to the left, and striking the ice and snow, still going at a rapid rate.

The rocket, which was later dubbed &quot;Nell&quot;, rose just 41 feet (12.5 meters) during a 2.5-second flight that ended 184 feet (56 meters) away in a cabbage field, but it was an important demonstration that liquid fuels and oxidizers were possible propellants for larger rockets. The launch site is now a National Historic Landmark, the Goddard Rocket Launching Site.

Viewers familiar with more modern rocket designs may find it difficult to distinguish the rocket from its launching apparatus in the well-known picture of &quot;Nell&quot;. The complete rocket is significantly taller than Goddard but does not include the pyramidal support structure which he is grasping. The rocket&#x27;s combustion chamber is the small cylinder at the top; the nozzle is visible beneath it. The fuel tank, which is also part of the rocket, is the larger cylinder opposite Goddard&#x27;s torso. The fuel tank is directly beneath the nozzle and is protected from the motor&#x27;s exhaust by an asbestos cone. Asbestos-wrapped aluminum tubes connect the motor to the tanks, providing both support and fuel transport. This layout is no longer used, since the experiment showed that this was no more stable than placing the combustion chamber and nozzle at the base. By May, after a series of modifications to simplify the plumbing, the combustion chamber and nozzle were placed in the now classic position, at the lower end of the rocket.

Goddard determined early that fins alone were not sufficient to stabilize the rocket in flight and keep it on the desired trajectory in the face of winds aloft and other disturbing forces. He added movable vanes in the exhaust, controlled by a gyroscope, to control and steer his rocket. (The Germans used this technique in their V-2.) He also introduced the more efficient swiveling engine in several rockets, basically the method used to steer large liquid-propellant missiles and launchers today.

==Lindbergh and Goddard==

After launch of one of Goddard&#x27;s rockets in July 1929 again gained the attention of the newspapers, Charles Lindbergh learned of his work in a &quot;New York Times&quot; article. At the time, Lindbergh had begun to wonder what would become of aviation (even space flight) in the distant future and had settled on jet propulsion and rocket flight as a probable next step. After checking with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and being assured that Goddard was a bona fide physicist and not a crackpot, he phoned Goddard in November 1929. Goddard met the aviator soon after in his office at Clark University. Upon meeting Goddard, Lindbergh was immediately impressed by his research, and Goddard was similarly impressed by the flier&#x27;s interest. He discussed his work openly with Lindbergh, forming an alliance that would last for the rest of his life. While having long since become reluctant to share his ideas, Goddard showed complete openness with those few who shared his dream, and whom he felt he could trust.

By late 1929, Goddard had been attracting additional notoriety with each rocket launch. He was finding it increasingly difficult to conduct his research without unwanted distractions. Lindbergh discussed finding additional financing for Goddard&#x27;s work and lent his famous name to Goddard&#x27;s work. In 1930 Lindbergh made several proposals to industry and private investors for funding, which proved all but impossible to find following the recent U.S. stock market crash in October 1929.

===Guggenheim sponsorship===
In the spring of 1930, Lindbergh finally found an ally in the Guggenheim family. Financier Daniel Guggenheim agreed to fund Goddard&#x27;s research over the next four years for a total of $100,000 (~$ today). The Guggenheim family, especially Harry Guggenheim, would continue to support Goddard&#x27;s work in the years to come. The Goddards soon moved to Roswell, New Mexico

Because of the military potential of the rocket, Goddard, Lindbergh, Harry Guggenheim, the Smithsonian Institution and others tried in 1940, before the U.S. entered World War II, to convince the Army and Navy of its value. Goddard&#x27;s services were offered, but there was no interest, initially. Two young, imaginative military officers eventually got the services to attempt to contract with Goddard just prior to the war. The Navy beat the Army to the punch and secured his services to build variable-thrust, liquid-fueled rocket engines for jet-assisted take-off (JATO) of aircraft. These rocket engines were the precursors to the larger throttlable rocket plane engines that helped launch the space age.

Astronaut Buzz Aldrin wrote that his father, Edwin Aldrin Sr. &quot;was an early supporter of Robert Goddard.&quot; The elder Aldrin was a student of physics under Goddard at Clark, and worked with Lindbergh to obtain the help of the Guggenheims. Buzz believed that if Goddard had received military support as Wernher von Braun&#x27;s team had enjoyed in Germany, American rocket technology would have developed much more rapidly in World War II.

===Lack of vision in the United States===
Before World War II there was a lack of vision and serious interest in the United States concerning the potential of rocketry, especially in Washington. Although the Weather Bureau was interested beginning in 1929 in Goddard&#x27;s rocket for atmospheric research, the Bureau could not secure governmental funding. Between the World Wars, the Guggenheim Foundation was the main source of funding for Goddard&#x27;s research. Goddard&#x27;s liquid-fueled rocket was neglected by his country, according to aerospace historian Eugene Emme, but was noticed and advanced by other nations, especially the Germans. Goddard showed remarkable prescience in 1923 in a letter to the Smithsonian. He knew that the Germans were very interested in rocketry and said he &quot;would not be surprised if the research would become something in the nature of a race,&quot; and he wondered how soon the European &quot;theorists&quot; would begin to build rockets.
In 1936, the U.S. military attaché in Berlin asked Charles Lindbergh to visit Germany and learn what he could of their progress in aviation. Although the Luftwaffe showed him their factories and were open concerning their growing airpower, they were silent on the subject of rocketry. When Lindbergh told Goddard of this behavior, Goddard said, &quot;Yes, they must have plans for the rocket. When will our own people in Washington listen to reason?&quot;

Most of the U.S.&#x27;s largest universities were also slow to realize rocketry&#x27;s potential. Just before World War II, the head of the aeronautics department at MIT, at a meeting held by the Army Air Corps to discuss project funding, said that the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) &quot;can take the Buck Rogers Job [rocket research].&quot; In 1941, Goddard tried to recruit an engineer for his team from MIT but could not find one who was interested. There were some exceptions: MIT was at least teaching basic rocketry, and Caltech had courses in rocketry and aerodynamics. After the war, Jerome Hunsaker of MIT, having studied Goddard&#x27;s patents, stated that &quot;Every liquid-fuel rocket that flies is a Goddard rocket.&quot;

While away in Roswell, Goddard was still head of the physics department at Clark University, and Clark allowed him to devote most of his time to rocket research. Likewise, the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) permitted astronomer Samuel Herrick to pursue research in space vehicle guidance and control, and shortly after the war to teach courses in spacecraft guidance and orbit determination. Herrick began corresponding with Goddard in 1931 and asked if he should work in this new field, which he named astrodynamics. Herrick said that Goddard had the vision to advise and encourage him in his use of celestial mechanics &quot;to anticipate the basic problem of space navigation.&quot; Herrick&#x27;s work contributed substantially to America&#x27;s readiness to control flight of Earth satellites and send men to the Moon and back.

==Roswell, New Mexico==

With new financial backing, Goddard eventually relocated to the Eden Valley Test Site in Roswell, New Mexico, in summer of 1930, where he worked with his team of technicians in near-isolation and relative secrecy for years. He had consulted a meteorologist as to the best area to do his work, and Roswell seemed ideal. Here they would not endanger anyone, would not be bothered by the curious and would experience a more moderate climate (which was also better for Goddard&#x27;s health). The locals valued personal privacy, knew Goddard desired his, and when travelers asked where Goddard&#x27;s facilities were located, they would likely be misdirected.

By September 1931, his rockets had the now familiar appearance of a smooth casing with tail-fins. He began experimenting with gyroscopic guidance and made a flight test of such a system in April 1932. A gyroscope mounted on gimbals electrically controlled steering vanes in the exhaust, similar to the system used by the German V-2 over 10 years later. Though the rocket crashed after a short ascent, the guidance system had worked, and Goddard considered the test a success.

A temporary loss of funding from the Guggenheims, as a result of the depression, forced Goddard in spring of 1932 to return to his much-loathed professorial responsibilities at Clark University. He remained at the university until the autumn of 1934, when funding resumed. Because of the death of the senior Daniel Guggenheim, the management of funding was taken on by his son, Harry Guggenheim. Upon his return to Roswell, he began work on his A series of rockets, 4 to 4.5 meters long, and powered by gasoline and liquid oxygen pressurized with nitrogen. The gyroscopic control system was housed in the middle of the rocket, between the propellant tanks.

The A-4 used a simpler pendulum system for guidance, as the gyroscopic system was being repaired. On March 8, 1935, it flew up to 1,000 feet, then turned into the wind and, Goddard reported, &quot;roared in a powerful descent across the prairie, at close to, or at, the speed of sound.&quot; On March 28, 1935, the A-5 successfully flew vertically to an altitude of (0.91 mi; 4,800 ft) using his gyroscopic guidance system. It then turned to a nearly horizontal path, flew 13,000 feet and achieved a maximum speed of 550 miles per hour. Goddard was elated because the guidance system kept the rocket on a vertical path so well.

In 1936–1939, Goddard began work on the K and L series rockets, which were much more massive and designed to reach very high altitude. The K series consisted of static bench tests of a more powerful engine, achieving a thrust of 624 lbs in February 1936. This work was plagued by trouble with chamber burn-through. In 1923, Goddard had built a regeneratively cooled engine, which circulated liquid oxygen around the outside of the combustion chamber, but he deemed the idea too complicated. He then used a curtain cooling method that involved spraying excess gasoline, which evaporated around the inside wall of the combustion chamber, but this scheme did not work well, and the larger rockets failed. Goddard returned to a smaller design, and his L-13 reached an altitude of 2.7 kilometers (1.7 mi; 8,900 ft), the highest of any of his rockets. Weight was reduced by using thin-walled fuel tanks wound with high-tensile-strength wire.


Goddard experimented with many of the features of today&#x27;s large rockets, such as multiple combustion chambers and nozzles. In November 1936, he flew the world&#x27;s first rocket (L-7) with multiple chambers, hoping to increase thrust without increasing the size of a single chamber. It had four combustion chambers, reached a height of 200 feet, and corrected its vertical path using blast vanes until one chamber burned through. This flight demonstrated that a rocket with multiple combustion chambers could fly stably and be easily guided. In July 1937 he replaced the guidance vanes with a movable tail section containing a single combustion chamber, as if on gimbals (thrust vectoring). The flight was of low altitude, but a large disturbance, probably caused by a change in the wind velocity, was corrected back to vertical. In an August test the flight path was corrected seven times by the movable tail and was captured on film by Mrs Goddard.

From 1940 to 1941, Goddard worked on the P series of rockets, which used propellant turbopumps (also powered by gasoline and liquid oxygen). The lightweight pumps produced higher propellant pressures, permitting a more powerful engine (greater thrust) and a lighter structure (lighter tanks and no pressurization tank), but two launches both ended in crashes after reaching an altitude of only a few hundred feet. The turbopumps worked well, however, and Goddard was pleased.

When Goddard mentioned the need for turbopumps, Harry Guggenheim suggested that he contact pump manufacturers to aid him. None were interested, as the development cost of these miniature pumps was prohibitive. Goddard&#x27;s team was therefore left on its own and from September 1938 to June 1940 designed and tested the small turbopumps and gas generators to operate the turbines. Esther later said that the pump tests were &quot;the most trying and disheartening phase of the research.&quot;

Goddard was able to flight-test many of his rockets, but many resulted in what the uninitiated would call failures, usually resulting from engine malfunction or loss of control. Goddard did not consider them failures, however, because he felt that he always learned something from a test. Most of his work involved static tests, which are a standard procedure today, before a flight test. He wrote to a correspondent: &quot;It is not a simple matter to differentiate unsuccessful from successful experiments. ... [Most] work that is finally successful is the result of a series of unsuccessful tests in which difficulties are gradually eliminated.&quot;

===General Jimmy Doolittle===
Jimmy Doolittle was introduced to the field of space science at an early point in its history. He recalls in his autobiography, &quot;I became interested in rocket development in the 1930s when I met Robert H. Goddard, who laid the foundation. ... While with Shell Oil I worked with him on the development of a type of fuel. ... &quot; Harry Guggenheim and Charles Lindbergh arranged for (then Major) Doolittle to discuss with Goddard a special blend of gasoline. Doolittle flew himself to Roswell in October 1938 and was given a tour of Goddard&#x27;s shop and a &quot;short course&quot; in rocketry. He then wrote a memo, including a rather detailed description of Goddard&#x27;s rocket. In closing he said, &quot;interplanetary transportation is probably a dream of the very distant future, but with the moon only a quarter of a million miles away—who knows!&quot; In July 1941, he wrote Goddard that he was still interested in his rocket propulsion research. The Army was interested only in JATO at this point. However, Doolittle and Lindbergh were concerned about the state of rocketry in the US, and Doolittle remained in touch with Goddard.

Shortly after World War II, Doolittle spoke concerning Goddard to an American Rocket Society (ARS) conference at which a large number interested in rocketry attended. He later stated that at that time &quot;we [in the aeronautics field] had not given much credence to the tremendous potential of rocketry.&quot; In 1956, he was appointed chairman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) because the previous chairman, Jerome C. Hunsaker, thought Doolittle to be more sympathetic than other scientists and engineers to the rocket, which was increasing in importance as a scientific tool as well as a weapon. Doolittle was instrumental in the successful transition of the NACA to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958. He was offered the position as first administrator of NASA, but he turned it down.

===Launch history===


Between 1926 and 1941, the following 35 rockets were launched:


===Analysis of results===
As an instrument for reaching extreme altitudes, Goddard&#x27;s rockets were not very successful; they did not achieve an altitude greater than 2.7 km in 1937, while a balloon sonde had already reached 35 km in 1921. By contrast, German rocket scientists had achieved an altitude of 2.4 km with the A-2 rocket in 1934, 8 km by 1939 with the A-5, and 176 km in 1942 with the A-4 (V-2) launched vertically, reaching the outer limits of the atmosphere and into space.

Goddard&#x27;s pace was slower than the Germans&#x27; because he did not have the resources they did. Simply reaching high altitudes was not his primary goal; he was trying, with a methodical approach, to perfect his liquid fuel engine and subsystems such as guidance and control so that his rocket could eventually achieve high altitudes without tumbling in the rare atmosphere, providing a stable vehicle for the experiments it would eventually carry. He had built the necessary turbopumps and was on the verge of building larger, lighter, more reliable rockets to reach extreme altitudes carrying scientific instruments when World War II intervened and changed the path of American history. He hoped to return to his experiments in Roswell after the war.

Though by the end of the Roswell years much of his technology had been replicated independently by others, he introduced new developments to rocketry that were used in this new enterprise: lightweight turbopumps, variable-thrust engine (in U.S.), engine with multiple combustion chambers and nozzles, and curtain cooling of combustion chamber.

Although Goddard had brought his work in rocketry to the attention of the United States Army, between World Wars, he was rebuffed, since the Army largely failed to grasp the military application of large rockets and said there was no money for new experimental weapons. German military intelligence, by contrast, had paid attention to Goddard&#x27;s work. The Goddards noticed that some mail had been opened, and some mailed reports had gone missing. An accredited military attaché to the US, Friedrich von Boetticher, sent a four-page report to the &quot;Abwehr&quot; in 1936, and the spy Gustav Guellich sent a mixture of facts and made-up information, claiming to have visited Roswell and witnessed a launch. The &quot;Abwehr&quot; was very interested and responded with more questions about Goddard&#x27;s work. Guellich&#x27;s reports did include information about fuel mixtures and the important concept of fuel-curtain cooling, but thereafter the Germans received very little information about Goddard.

The Soviet Union had a spy (name still not declassified as of 2009) in the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics. In 1935, she gave them a report Goddard had written for the Navy in 1933. It contained results of tests and flights and suggestions for military uses of his rockets. The Soviets considered this to be very valuable information. It provided few design details, but gave them the direction and knowledge about Goddard&#x27;s progress.

== Annapolis, Maryland ==
Navy Lieutenant Charles F. Fischer, who had visited Goddard in Roswell earlier and gained his confidence, believed Goddard was doing valuable work and was able to convince the Bureau of Aeronautics in September 1941 that Goddard could build the JATO unit the Navy desired. While still in Roswell, and before the Navy contract took effect, Goddard began in September to apply his technology to build a variable-thrust engine to be attached to a PBY seaplane. By May 1942, he had a unit that could meet the Navy&#x27;s requirements and be able to launch a heavily loaded aircraft from a short runway. In February, he received part of a PBY with bullet holes apparently acquired in the Pearl Harbor attack. Goddard wrote to Guggenheim that &quot;I can think of nothing that would give me greater satisfaction than to have it contribute to the inevitable retaliation.&quot;

In April, Fischer notified Goddard that the Navy wanted to do all its rocket work at the Engineering Experiment Station at Annapolis. Esther, worried that a move to the climate of Maryland would cause Robert&#x27;s health to deteriorate faster, objected. But the patriotic Goddard replied, &quot;Esther, don&#x27;t you know there&#x27;s a war on?&quot; Fischer also questioned the move, as Goddard could work just as well in Roswell. Goddard simply answered, &quot;I was wondering when you would ask me.&quot; Fischer had wanted to offer him something bigger—a long range missile—but JATO was all he could manage, hoping for a greater project later. It was a case of a square peg in a round hole, according to a disappointed Goddard.

Goddard and his team had already been in Annapolis a month and had tested his constant-thrust JATO engine when he received a Navy telegram, forwarded from Roswell, ordering him to Annapolis. Lt. Fischer asked for a crash effort. By August, his engine was producing 800 lbs of thrust for 20 seconds, and Fischer was anxious to try it on a PBY. On the sixth test run, with all bugs worked out, the PBY, piloted by Fischer, was pushed into the air from the Severn River. Fischer landed and prepared to launch again. Goddard had wanted to check the unit, but radio contact with the PBY had been lost. On the seventh try, the engine caught fire. The plane was 150 feet up when flight was aborted. Because Goddard had installed a safety feature at the last minute, there was no explosion and there were no deaths. The problem&#x27;s cause was traced to hasty installation and rough handling. Cheaper, safer solid fuel JATO engines were eventually selected by the armed forces. An engineer later said, &quot;Putting [Goddard&#x27;s] rocket on a seaplane was like hitching an eagle to a plow.&quot;

Goddard&#x27;s first biographer Milton Lehman notes:

In its 1942 crash effort to perfect an aircraft booster, the Navy was beginning to learn its way in rocketry. In similar efforts, the Army Air Corps was also exploring the field [with GALCIT]. Compared to Germany&#x27;s massive program, these beginnings were small, yet essential to later progress. They helped develop a nucleus of trained American rocket engineers, the first of the new breed who would follow the professor into the Age of Space.

In August 1943, President Atwood at Clark wrote to Goddard that the university was losing the acting head of the physics department, was taking on &quot;emergency work&quot; for the army, and he was to &quot;report for duty or declare the position vacant.&quot; Goddard replied that he believed he was needed by the navy, was nearing retirement age, and was unable to lecture because of his throat problem, which did not allow him to talk above a whisper. He regretfully resigned as professor of physics and expressed his deepest appreciation for all Atwood and the trustees had done for him and indirectly for the war effort. In June he had gone to see a throat specialist in Baltimore, who recommended that he not talk at all, to give his throat a rest.

The station, under Lt Commander Robert Truax, was developing another JATO engine in 1942 that used hypergolic propellants, eliminating the need for an ignition system. Chemist Ensign Ray Stiff had discovered in the literature in February that aniline and nitric acid burned fiercely immediately when mixed. Goddard&#x27;s team built the pumps for the aniline fuel and the nitric acid oxidizer and participated in the static testing. The Navy delivered the pumps to Reaction Motors (RMI) to use in developing a gas generator for the pump turbines. Goddard went to RMI to observe testing of the pump system and would eat lunch with the RMI engineers. (RMI was the first firm formed to build rocket engines and built engines for the Bell X-1 rocket plane and Viking (rocket). RMI offered Goddard one-fifth interest in the company and a partnership after the war.) Goddard went with Navy people in December 1944 to confer with RMI on division of labor, and his team was to provide the propellant pump system for a rocket-powered interceptor because they had more experience with pumps. He consulted with RMI from 1942 through 1945. Though previously competitors, Goddard had a good working relationship with RMI, according to historian Frank H. Winter.

The Navy had Goddard build a pump system for Caltech&#x27;s use with acid-aniline propellants. The team built a 3000-lb thrust engine using a cluster of four 750-lb thrust motors. They also developed 750-lb engines for the Navy&#x27;s Gorgon guided interceptor missile (experimental Project Gorgon). Goddard continued to develop the variable-thrust engine with gasoline and lox because of the hazards involved with the hypergolics.

Despite Goddard&#x27;s efforts to convince the Navy that liquid-fueled rockets had greater potential, he said that the Navy had no interest in long-range missiles. However, the Navy asked him to perfect the throttleable JATO engine. Goddard made improvements to the engine, and in November it was demonstrated to the Navy and some officials from Washington. Fischer invited the spectators to operate the controls; the engine blasted out over the Severn at full throttle with no hesitation, idled, and roared again at various thrust levels. The test was perfect, exceeding the Navy&#x27;s requirements. The unit was able to be stopped and restarted, and it produced a medium thrust of 600 pounds for 15 seconds and a full thrust of 1,000 pounds for over 15 seconds. A Navy Commander commented that &quot;It was like being Thor, playing with thunderbolts.&quot; Goddard had produced the essential propulsion control system of the rocket plane. The Goddards celebrated by attending the Army-Navy football game and attending the Fischers&#x27; cocktail party.

This engine was the basis of the Curtiss-Wright XLR25-CW-1 two-chamber, 15,000-pound variable-thrust engine that powered the Bell X-2 research rocket plane. After World War II, Goddard&#x27;s team and some patents went to Curtiss-Wright Corporation. &quot;Although his death in August 1945 prevented him from participating in the actual development of this engine, it was a direct descendent of his design.&quot; Clark University and the Guggenheim Foundation received the royalties from the use of the patents. In September 1956, the X-2 was the first plane to reach 126,000 feet altitude and in its last flight exceeded Mach 3 (3.2) before losing control and crashing. The X-2 program advanced technology in areas such as steel alloys and aerodynamics at high Mach numbers.

== The German V-2 ==
In the spring of 1945, Goddard saw a captured German V-2 ballistic missile, in the naval laboratory in Annapolis, Maryland, where he had been working under contract. The unlaunched rocket had been captured by the US Army from the Mittelwerk factory in the Harz mountains in Germany and samples began to be shipped by Special Mission V-2 on 22 May 1945.

After a thorough inspection, Goddard was convinced that the Germans had &quot;stolen&quot; his work. Though the design details were not exactly the same, the basic design of the V-2 was similar to one of Goddard&#x27;s rockets. The V-2, however, was technically far more advanced than the most successful of the rockets designed and tested by Goddard. The Peenemünde rocket group led by Wernher von Braun may have benefited from the pre-1939 contacts to a limited extent, but had also started from the work of their own space pioneer, Hermann Oberth; they also had the benefit of intensive state funding, large-scale production facilities (using slave labor), and repeated flight-testing that allowed them to refine their designs. Oberth was a space flight theorist and had never built a rocket, but he tested small liquid propellant thrust chambers in 1929–30 which were not advances in the &quot;state of the art&quot;. In 1922 Oberth asked Goddard for a copy of his 1919 paper and was sent one though Goddard was distrustful of the militaristic Germans. Later, Oberth erroneously believed that Goddard lacked vision, was interested only in studying the atmosphere, and did not comprehend the future of rocketry for space exploration.

Nevertheless, in 1963, von Braun, reflecting on the history of rocketry, said of Goddard: &quot;His rockets ... may have been rather crude by present-day standards, but they blazed the trail and incorporated many features used in our most modern rockets and space vehicles&quot;. He once recalled that &quot;Goddard&#x27;s experiments in liquid fuel saved us years of work, and enabled us to perfect the V-2 years before it would have been possible.&quot; After World War II von Braun reviewed Goddard&#x27;s patents and believed they contained enough technical information to build a large missile.

Three features developed by Goddard appeared in the V-2: (1) turbopumps were used to inject fuel into the combustion chamber; (2) gyroscopically controlled vanes in the nozzle stabilized the rocket until external vanes in the air could do so; and (3) excess alcohol was fed in around the combustion chamber walls, so that a blanket of evaporating gas protected the engine walls from the combustion heat.
The Germans had been watching Goddard&#x27;s progress before the war and became convinced that large, liquid fuel rockets were feasible. General Walter Dornberger, head of the V-2 project, used the idea that they were in a race with the U.S. and that Goddard had &quot;disappeared&quot; (to work with the Navy) as a way to persuade Hitler to raise the priority of the V-2.

== Goddard&#x27;s secrecy ==
Goddard avoided sharing details of his work with other scientists and preferred to work alone with his technicians. Frank Malina, who was then studying rocketry at the California Institute of Technology, visited Goddard in August 1936. Goddard hesitated to discuss any of his research, other than that which had already been published in &quot;Liquid-Propellant Rocket Development&quot;. Theodore von Kármán, Malina&#x27;s mentor at the time, was unhappy with Goddard&#x27;s attitude and later wrote, &quot;Naturally we at Caltech wanted as much information as we could get from Goddard for our mutual benefit. But Goddard believed in secrecy. ... The trouble with secrecy is that one can easily go in the wrong direction and never know it.&quot; However, at an earlier point, von Kármán said that Malina was &quot;highly enthusiastic&quot; after his visit and that Caltech made changes to their liquid-propellant rocket, based on Goddard&#x27;s work and patents. Malina remembered his visit as friendly and that he saw all but a few components in Goddard&#x27;s shop.

Goddard&#x27;s concerns about secrecy led to criticism for failure to cooperate with other scientists and engineers. His approach at that time was that independent development of his ideas without interference would bring quicker results even though he received less technical support. George Sutton, who became a rocket scientist working with von Braun&#x27;s team in the late 1940s, said that he and his fellow workers had not heard of Goddard or his contributions and that they would have saved time if they had known the details of his work. Sutton admits that it may have been their fault for not looking for Goddard&#x27;s patents and depending on the German team for knowledge and guidance; he wrote that information about the patents was not well distributed in the U.S. at that early period after World War II, though Germany and the Soviet Union had copies of some of them. (The Patent Office did not release rocket patents during World War II.) However, the Aerojet Engineering Corporation, an offshoot of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at Caltech (GALCIT), filed two patent applications in Sep 1943 referencing Goddard&#x27;s for the multistage rocket.

By 1939, von Kármán&#x27;s GALCIT had received Army Air Corps funding to develop rockets to assist in aircraft take-off. Goddard learned of this in 1940, and openly expressed his displeasure at not being considered. Malina could not understand why the Army did not arrange for an exchange of information between Goddard and Caltech since both were under government contract at the same time. Goddard did not think he could be of that much help to Caltech because they were designing rocket engines mainly with solid fuel, while he was using liquid fuel.

Goddard was concerned with avoiding the public criticism and ridicule he had faced in the 1920s, which he believed had harmed his professional reputation. He also lacked interest in discussions with people who had less understanding of rocketry than he did, feeling that his time was extremely constrained. Goddard&#x27;s health was frequently poor, as a result of his earlier bout of tuberculosis, and he was uncertain about how long he had to live. He felt, therefore, that he hadn&#x27;t the time to spare arguing with other scientists and the press about his new field of research, or helping all the amateur rocketeers who wrote to him. In 1932 Goddard wrote to H. G. Wells:

How many more years I shall be able to work on the problem, I do not know; I hope, as long as I live. There can be no thought of finishing, for &quot;aiming at the stars&quot;, both literally and figuratively, is a problem to occupy generations, so that no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.

Goddard spoke to professional groups, published articles and papers and patented his ideas; but while he discussed basic principles, he was unwilling to reveal the details of his designs until he had flown rockets to high altitudes and thus proven his theory. He tended to avoid any mention of space flight, and spoke only of high-altitude research, since he believed that other scientists regarded the subject as unscientific. GALCIT saw Goddard&#x27;s publicity problems and that the word &quot;rocket&quot; was &quot;of such bad repute&quot; that they used the word &quot;jet&quot; in the name of JPL and the related Aerojet Engineering Corporation.

Many authors writing about Goddard mention his secrecy, but neglect the reasons for it. Some reasons have been noted above. Much of his work was for the military and was classified. There were some in the U.S. before World War II that called for long-range rockets, and in 1939 Major James Randolph wrote a &quot;provocative article&quot; advocating a 3000-mile range missile. Goddard was &quot;annoyed&quot; by the unclassified paper as he thought the subject of weapons should be &quot;discussed in strict secrecy.&quot;

However, Goddard&#x27;s tendency to secrecy was not absolute, nor was he totally uncooperative. In 1945 GALCIT was building the WAC Corporal for the Army. But they were having trouble with their liquid propellant rocket engine&#x27;s performance (timely, smooth ignition and explosions). Frank Malina went to Annapolis in February and consulted with Goddard and Stiff, and they arrived at a solution to the problem (hypergolic propellant: nitric acid and aniline), which resulted in the successful launch of the high-altitude research rocket in October 1945.

During the First and Second World Wars, Goddard offered his services, patents, and technology to the military, and made some significant contributions. Just before the Second World War several young Army officers and a few higher-ranking ones believed Goddard&#x27;s research was important but were unable to generate funds for his work.

Toward the end of his life, Goddard, realizing he was no longer going to be able to make significant progress alone in his field, joined the American Rocket Society and became a director. He made plans to work in the budding US aerospace industry (with Curtiss-Wright), taking most of his team with him.

==Personal life==
On June 21, 1924, Goddard married Esther Christine Kisk (March 31, 1901 – June 4, 1982), a secretary in Clark University&#x27;s President&#x27;s office, whom he had met in 1919. She became enthusiastic about rocketry and photographed some of his work as well as aided him in his experiments and paperwork, including accounting. They enjoyed going to the movies in Roswell and participated in community organizations such as the Rotary and the Woman&#x27;s Club. He painted the New Mexican scenery, sometimes with the artist Peter Hurd, and played the piano. She played bridge, while he read. Esther said Robert participated in the community and readily accepted invitations to speak to church and service groups. The couple did not have children. After his death, she sorted out Goddard&#x27;s papers, and secured 131 additional patents on his work.

Concerning Goddard&#x27;s religious views, he was raised as an Episcopalian, though he was not outwardly religious. The Goddards were associated with the Episcopal church in Roswell, and he attended occasionally. He once spoke to a young people&#x27;s group on the relationship of science and religion.

Goddard&#x27;s serious bout with tuberculosis weakened his lungs, affecting his ability to work, and was one reason he liked to work alone, in order to avoid argument and confrontation with others and use his time fruitfully. He labored with the prospect of a shorter than average life span. After arriving in Roswell, Goddard applied for life insurance, but when the company doctor examined him he said that Goddard belonged in a bed in Switzerland (where he could get the best care). Goddard&#x27;s health began to deteriorate further after moving to the humid climate of Maryland to work for the Navy. He was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1945. He continued to work, able to speak only in a whisper until surgery was required, and he died in August of that year in Baltimore, Maryland. He was buried in Hope Cemetery in his home town of Worcester, Massachusetts.

==Legacy==
===Influence===
* Goddard was credited with 214 patents for his work; 131 of these were awarded after his death.
* Goddard influenced many people who went on to do significant work in the U.S. space program, such as Robert Truax (USN), Milton Rosen (Naval Research Laboratory and NASA), astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Jim Lovell, NASA flight controller Gene Kranz, astrodynamicist Samuel Herrick (UCLA), and General Jimmy Doolittle (US Army and NACA). Buzz Aldrin took a miniature sized biography of Goddard on his historic voyage to the Moon aboard Apollo 11.
* Goddard received the Langley Gold Medal from the Smithsonian Institution in 1960, and the Congressional Gold Medal on September 16, 1959.
* The Goddard Space Flight Center, a NASA facility in Greenbelt, Maryland, was established in 1959.
* The crater Goddard on the Moon is named in his honor.
* The Dr. Robert H. Goddard Collection and the Robert Goddard Exhibition Room are housed in the Archives and Special Collections area of Clark University&#x27;s Robert H. Goddard Library.
* Robert H. Goddard High School was completed in 1965 in Roswell, New Mexico, and dedicated by Esther Goddard; the school&#x27;s mascot is titled &quot;Rockets&quot;.

* The Goddard Rocket Launching Site in Auburn, Massachusetts, is a National Historic Landmark. The location was formerly the Asa Ward Farm, and is now a golf course.
* New Goddard prototype experimental reusable vertical launch and landing rocket from Blue Origin is named after Goddard.
* The Dr. Robert H. Goddard Award, also known as the Achievement 7 Award, is an award given to cadets of the Civil Air Patrol who reach the rank of Cadet Chief Master Sergeant. The promotion and the award are always given concurrently and in unison with one another.

===In popular culture===
* Children&#x27;s author Isabel Hornibrook, in her novel &quot;Pemrose Lorry: Campfire Girl&quot; (Little, Brown and Company, 1921) claimed in the preface to have been the first to exploit Goddard&#x27;s rocket as a plot device. In the last chapter, she wrote, &quot;And never–oh! never since the history of Mother Earth and her satellite began did such a spectacular traveler start on such a flaming trip as when the hand of a Camp Fire Girl of America threw the switch and the steel explorer, twenty feet long, leaped from its platform high into the air, pointed directly for the moon, with a great inventor’s mathematical precision,–trailing its two-hundred-foot, rosy trail of fire. There was not breath–not breath, even, to cry: “Watch it tear!”&quot;
* In &quot;F.L.A.S.H.!&quot;, episode 10 of season 11 of the Canadian television period drama Murdoch Mysteries (January 8, 2018), Goddard is played by Andrew Robinson and is described as a rocket scientist and chief scientist for a fictional pneumatic tube public transport system in early 1900s Toronto, Canada.
* Rocket, an American pale ale made by the Wormtown Brewery of Worcester, Massachusetts is named in Goddard&#x27;s honor.

===Patents of interest===
Goddard received 214 patents for his work, of which 131 were awarded after his death. Among the most influential patents were:

* – &quot;Rocket apparatus&quot;
* – &quot;Rocket apparatus&quot;
* – &quot;Mechanism for feeding combustion liquids to rocket apparatus&quot;
* – &quot;Control mechanism for rocket apparatus&quot;
* – &quot;Control mechanism for rocket apparatus&quot;
* – &quot;Vacuum tube transportation system&quot; – E. C. Goddard
The Guggenheim Foundation and Goddard&#x27;s estate filed suit in 1951 against the U.S. government for prior infringement of three of Goddard&#x27;s patents. In 1960, the parties settled the suit, and the U.S. armed forces and NASA paid out an award of $1 million: half of the award settlement went to his wife, Esther. At that time, it was the largest government settlement ever paid in a patent case. The settlement amount exceeded the total amount of all the funding that Goddard received for his work, throughout his entire career.

=== Important firsts ===
* First American to explore mathematically the practicality of using rocket propulsion to reach high altitudes and to traject to the Moon (1912)
* First to receive a U.S. patent on the idea of a multistage rocket (1914)
* First to static test a rocket in a systematic, scientific manner, measuring thrust, exhaust velocity and efficiency. He obtained the highest efficiency of any heat engine at the time. (1915-1916)
* First to prove that rocket propulsion operates in a vacuum (which was doubted by some scientists of that time), that it needs no air to push against. He actually obtained a 20% increase in efficiency over that determined at ground-level atmospheric pressure (1915–1916).
* First to prove that an oxidizer and a fuel could be mixed using injectors and burned controllably in a combustion chamber, also doubted by physicists.
* First to develop suitable lightweight centrifugal pumps for liquid-fuel rockets and also gas generators to drive the pump turbine (1923).
* First to attach a DeLaval type of nozzle to the combustion chamber of a solid-fuel engine and increase efficiency by more than ten times. The exhaust flow became supersonic at the narrowest cross-sectional area (throat) of the nozzle.
* First to develop the liquid propellant feed system using a high-pressure gas to force the propellants from their tanks into the thrust chamber (1923).
* First to develop and successfully fly a liquid-propellant rocket (March 16, 1926)
* First to launch a scientific payload (a barometer, a thermometer, and a camera) in a rocket flight (1929)
* First to use vanes in the rocket engine exhaust for guidance (1932)
* First to develop gyroscopic control apparatus for guiding rocket flight (1932)
* First to launch and successfully guide a rocket with an engine pivoted by moving the tail section (as if on gimbals) controlled by a gyro mechanism (1937)
* Built lightweight propellant tanks out of thin sheets of steel and aluminum and used external high-strength steel wiring for reinforcement. He introduced baffles in the tanks to minimize sloshing which changed the center gravity of the vehicle. He used insulation on the very cold liquid-oxygen components.
* First in U.S. to design and test a variable-thrust rocket engine.
* First to fly a rocket with an engine having multiple (four) thrust chambers.
* First to test regenerative cooling of the thrust chamber in March 1923 (first suggested by Tsiolkovsky but unknown to Goddard).

<text>Lance Corporal Ian Malone (8 December 1974 – 6 April 2003) from Dublin, Ireland, was a member of the British Army&#x27;s Irish Guards. He was the first person born in Ireland to be killed in the Iraq War. Malone&#x27;s funeral in Dublin was the first funeral with a uniformed British military presence in the Republic of Ireland.

==Background==
Twenty-eight-year-old Ian Malone came from a working class background in the Dublin suburb of Ballyfermot. The eldest of a family of five, Malone was educated by the De La Salle Christian Brothers Catholic school. He served in FCA, the Irish reserve defence force. It is claimed that he applied to join the Irish Army but was rejected due to his age. When he joined the Irish Guards in 1997, a regiment of the British Army created in 1900 by Queen Victoria, he was 23 years old and the age limits for the Irish Army at that time was over 17 years and under 21 years of age (with the age limit extended to a max of 25 years if the recruit held a 3rd Level Degree) .

==Military service==
Malone was promoted to lance corporal in October 2000 and served on Operation Agricola in Kosovo. He completed a piper&#x27;s course in April 1999, and was a member of the pipe band. He also served with the Battle Group in Poland, Canada, Oman and Germany.

In November 2002 Lance Corporal Malone was one of a number of British soldiers interviewed on a Radio Telefís Éireann documentary series, &quot;True Lives&quot;. Regarding his membership of the British Army, he said:
:&quot;At the end of the day I am just abroad doing a job. People go on about Irishmen dying for freedom and all that. That&#x27;s a fair one. They did. But they died to give men like me the freedom to choose what to do.&quot;

Malone was deployed on Operation Telic in an armoured infantry section with Number 1 Company, Irish Guards, as part of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards Battle Group within 7 Armoured Brigade. Lance Corporal Malone was shot in the head by a sniper on 6 April in Iraq during the Irish Guards&#x27; advance on the country&#x27;s second largest city, Basra.

==Funeral==
The removal of Lance Corporal Malone&#x27;s body to Our Lady of the Assumption Catholic church in Ballyfermot was attended by hundreds of people, including Charlie O&#x27;Connor, a local TD, whose father had served in the Irish Guards. His funeral on 24 April 2003 was celebrated by Fr. Dave Lumsden and drew large crowds, including senior politicians from the opposition such as Gay Mitchell, TD. An honour guard of the Irish Guards in their full dress uniform was provided, though the coffin was not draped in the Union flag. One piper from the Irish Guard and one piper from the Irish Defence Forces, 2inf bn Cq C o&#x27;Dywer PM, played at the funeral, Oft in the stilly night. Mass. His funeral was the first time since 1922, that uniformed British Army soldiers had been seen in Dublin.

<text>Robert William Goddard (born 13 November 1954 in Fareham, Hampshire) is an English novelist.

==Life and career==
Goddard was educated at Bathampton County Primary School then Wallisdean County Junior School and Price&#x27;s Grammar School in Fareham, before going on to study history at Peterhouse, Cambridge. After unsuccessful attempts at careers in both journalism and teaching, he worked for a time as an educational administrator in Devon before becoming a full-time novelist. His thrillers usually have a historical element and settings in English towns and cities, and many plot twists. They usually involve the lead character gradually uncovering a secret or conspiracy which has long been kept secret, by means of historical documents such as diaries or by means of word-of-mouth accounts that have been handed down from one person to another. Goddard&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Past Caring&quot;, was published in 1986. He has since written more than twenty novels; the majority have been &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Top Ten best-sellers in the UK.

==Awards==
Goddard&#x27;s 1990 book &quot;Into the Blue&quot; was the inaugural winner of the W H Smith Thumping Good Read Award, presented to the best new fiction author of the year.

Goddard&#x27;s 1997 book &quot;Beyond Recall&quot; was nominated for the Edgar Award Best Novel prize but lost out to &quot;Mr. White&#x27;s Confession&quot; by Robert Clark.

Goddard&#x27;s book &quot;Long Time Coming&quot; won the 2011 Edgar Award for Best Original Paperback and was nominated for the 2011 Anthony award in the same category.

In 2019, Goddard was awarded the Cartier Diamond Dagger by the Crime Writers&#x27; Association for his outstanding lifetime contribution to the crime fiction genre.

==Harry Barnett==
The books &quot;Into the Blue&quot;, &quot;Out of the Sun&quot; and &quot;Never Go Back&quot;, although distinct books in their own right, form a chronological series featuring the central character of Harry Barnett. Harry Barnett also appears in both of Goddard&#x27;s two published short stories, one of which, &quot;Toupee for a Bald Tyre&quot;, is set in 1970 before the events of the books.

&quot;Into the Blue&quot; was adapted for television in 1997 and starred John Thaw in the lead role of Harry Barnett. Robert Goddard was not impressed with the adaptation. In an interview, he said &quot;The TV version of &quot;Into the Blue&quot; was a travesty of the story I wrote and I am determined that any future adaptations should be more faithful to the original&quot;.

==Personal life==
Robert Goddard is married and lives with his wife Vaunda in Truro, Cornwall. Several of the recent books published in his name have identified Vaunda as a joint holder of the copyright.
