<text>Kia Corporation (, , formerly known as Kyungsung Precision Industry (京城精密工業) and Kia Motors Corporation) is a South Korean multinational automobile manufacturer headquartered in Seoul, South Korea. It is South Korea&#x27;s second largest automobile manufacturer, after its parent company, Hyundai Motor Company, with sales of over 2.8 million vehicles in 2019. Kia is owned by Hyundai, which holds a 33.88% stake valued at just over US$6 billion. Kia in turn is a minority owner of more than twenty Hyundai subsidiaries ranging from 4.9% up to 45.37%, totaling more than US$8.3 billion.

== Etymology ==
According to the company, &quot;Kia&quot; derives from the Hanja (, &#x27;to arise&#x27;) and (, which stands for , meaning &#x27;Asia&#x27;); it is roughly translated as &quot;Rising from (East) Asia&quot;.

== History ==

===Origins and the early expansion===
Kia was founded on June 9, 1944, as Kyungsung Precision Industry, a manufacturer of steel tubing and bicycle parts, eventually producing Korea&#x27;s first domestic bicycle, the Samchuly, in 1951. In 1952, Kyungsung Precision Industry changed its name to Kia Industries, and later built Honda-licensed small motorcycles (starting in 1957) and Mazda-licensed trucks (1962) and cars (1974). The company opened its first integrated automotive assembly plant in 1973, the Sohari Plant. Kia built the small Mazda-based Brisa range of cars until 1981, when production came to an end after the new military dictator Chun Doo-hwan enforced industry consolidation. This forced Kia to give up passenger cars and focus entirely on light trucks. Kia assembled a few hundred more cars in 1982 and 1983, after the ban had taken effect, but no passenger cars were built in 1984 and 1985.

Prior to the forced 1981 shutdown, Kia had rounded out its passenger car lineup with two other foreign models assembled under license: the Fiat 132 and the Peugeot 604. The import of these knock-down kits was permitted as long as Kia exported five cars for every single Fiat or Peugeot brought in (Hyundai had to meet the same requirement).

Starting in 1986 (when only 26 cars were manufactured, followed by over 95,000 the next year), Kia rejoined the automobile industry in partnership with Ford. Kia produced several Mazda-derived vehicles for both domestic sales in South Korea and for export into other countries - where they were positioned at the budget end of the market. These models included the Kia Pride, based on the Mazda 121 and the Avella, which were sold in North America and Australasia as the Ford Festiva and Ford Aspire. In 1992, Kia Motors America was incorporated in the United States. The first Kia-branded vehicles in the United States were sold from four dealerships in Portland, Oregon, in 1993. Since then, Kia methodically expanded one region at a time. Dealers in 1994 sold the Sephia and a few years later the United States segment expanded their line with the Sportage. Over one hundred Kia dealerships existed across thirty states by 1995, selling a record 24,740 automobiles.

===Hyundai Motor Company takeover===
Kia declared bankruptcy in 1997, during the Asian financial crisis, and in 1998 reached an agreement with Hyundai Motor Company to diversify by exchanging ownership between the two companies. Hyundai Motor Company acquired 51% of the company, outbidding Ford Motor Company, which had owned an interest in Kia Motors since 1986. After subsequent divestments, Hyundai Motor Company owns about one third of Kia Motor Corporation. While Hyundai Motor Company remains Kia&#x27;s largest stakeholder, Kia Motor Company also retains ownership in some 22 Hyundai Motor Company subsidiaries.

===Later development===

Since 2005, Kia has focused on the European market and has identified design as its &quot;core future growth engine&quot; – leading to the hiring of Peter Schreyer in 2006 as chief design officer and his subsequent creation of a new corporate grille known as the &#x27;Tiger Nose&#x27;. In October 2006, Kia Motors America broke ground for Kia Motors Manufacturing Georgia in West Point, Georgia, representing a US$1 billion investment for the company. Kia Motors Manufacturing Georgia opened in February 2010, after Kia recorded its 15th consecutive year of increased U.S. market share.

Kia started using an angular &quot;KIA&quot; wordmark logo in early 2021.

Kia&#x27;s Tasman pickup truck made its global debut at the Jeddah International Motor Show in Saudi Arabia on 29 Oct. 2024.

== Affiliates and subsidiaries ==
=== Hyundai Motor Company ===
, the Hyundai Motor Company owns a 33.88% stake in Kia Motors. Likewise, , Kia Motors is a part owner of 22 Hyundai companies. Its ownership percentages range from 4.9% to 45.37%.

=== Kia America ===


Kia Motors America (KMA), now known as Kia America, Inc., was incorporated in California on October 21, 1992, and became the American sales, marketing, and distribution arm of Kia Corporation. Kia America is based in Irvine, California, and currently offers a complete line of vehicles through more than 755 dealers throughout the United States. The first two models that were introduced to the U.S. market in 1993 were KIA Sephia and Kia Sportage 4x4. In the United States, sales began in late 1993 for the 1994 model year, at four dealerships in Portland, Oregon. The two models most recently introduced to the U.S. market have both been highly awarded during the short time since their launch: the 2018 Stinger performance sedan gained recognition with J.D. Power&#x27;s inaugural &quot;Engineering Award for Highest Rated All-New Vehicle&quot; as well as Business Insider&#x27;s &quot;Car of the Year Award&quot;, then the 2020 Telluride made its mark several times over by winning major awards from review organizations like Kelley Blue Book, MotorTrend, Hispanic Motor Press also awarded the Telluride as the best SUV for 2020, and most recently Edmunds.

As a brand, KMA has continued to improve over the years as well; in 2013, Kia Motors America recorded its 18th consecutive year of increased U.S. market share, and for the past five consecutive years (2015–2019) it has been recognized by J.D. Power as the highest ranked mass market brand in initial quality.

In November 2009, Kia started production at the first U.S. Kia Motors plant, Kia Motors Manufacturing Georgia, in West Point. Though the Kia Sorento crossover vehicle was the only model to be assembled there at first, the facility has since expanded its production lines to include the Kia Optima mid-size sedan, now sold as the K5, in 2011 and the just-launched Kia Telluride crossover SUV in January 2019. As of September 2019, the location has successfully built over 3 million units of these three models altogether, and shortly after celebrated another milestone by reaching its 10th year of production in November 2019. Currently, the facility has a production capacity of 340,000 vehicles per year (largely dedicated to the Telluride and Sorento crossover SUVs) and is responsible for distributing them to hundreds of dealerships in the U.S. and Canada, as well as fulfilling shipments across North America and even overseas.

=== Kia Canada ===

Kia Canada was formed in 1999 as a subsidiary of Kia Motors Corporation serving the Canadian market. It is headquartered in Mississauga, Ontario, where it employs approximately 180 people. Kia Canada is best known for its mid-market lineup of sport utility vehicles and crossovers, which are midway in size between SUVs and ordinary sedans, and increasingly for its electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. In 2021, Kia Canada introduced a new logo and slogan, &quot;Movement that inspires&quot;. As of 2021, Kia Canada sold nearly 80,000 vehicles a year.

=== Kia Central &amp; South America Corp. ===
Kia Central &amp; South America Corp. is an incorporated division of Kia Corporation in charge of sales and marketing in 43 countries across Central and South America (including Brazil), and the Caribbean. The regional headquarters is located in Miami, Florida (US).

=== Kia Europe ===
Kia Europe is the European sales and marketing division of Kia Corporation. It has been selling cars in Europe since the first half of 1991.

Kia Motors Europe is formally founded in 1995, in Neu Wulmstorf (near Hamburg). In 1997, Kia moves its European headquarters from Neu Wulmstorf to Bremen, and due to logistical reasons since around 2005, Kia moved its European headquarters to Eschborn (near Frankfurt).

In 2007, KME moved from its previous location at Hauptstrasse 185, Eschborn (near Frankfurt), to a new purpose-built facility adjacent to the Messe, in Frankfurt city centre.

When Kia launched in Europe during 1991, it initially sold only the Pride supermini – a rebadged version of the late 1980s Mazda 121. It initially proved popular with buyers. By the end of 1991, Kia had sold nearly 1,800 Prides in the United Kingdom. The first full year, 1992, saw that figure double, and, in 1993, it increased again to nearly 5,500 units. However, sales fell towards the end of the decade, and the end of production was finally announced in May 2000, with its successor – the Rio – not going on sale for another year.

From 1995 to 1999, Kia produced left- and right-hand drive versions of the first generation Sportage SUV at the Karmann factory in Osnabrück, Germany. These have been popular across Europe, but, since 2002, Kia has gained more sales in this market thanks to the launch of the larger Sorento. From 1999 until production of the model ceased in 2003, all Sportage production reverted to South Korea.

The European range also expanded in the spring of 1994 when Kia began importing the larger Mentor, a range of medium-sized hatchbacks and sedans which were marketed as inexpensive and well-equipped alternatives to the likes of the Ford Escort and the Vauxhall/Opel Astra.

A facelift in 1999 saw the Mentor name retained for the saloon (sedan), but the hatchback was renamed Shuma. These models remained on sale until 2004, when the newer Cerato was launched and gave Kia one of its first serious competitors against mainstream brands. The Clarus saloon and Sedona MPV were also launched onto the UK market during 1999, helping Kia begin its rise in popularity.

Despite Kia&#x27;s range increasing from one car as late as 1993, to three cars by the end of 1995, British sales actually decreased in that period, from nearly 5,500 in 1993 to less than 4,000 the following year. In 1998, Kia&#x27;s future in Britain was thrown into serious doubt when it sold less than 3,000 of its whole range – the worst in any full year on the British market. Kia did not enter Europe&#x27;s large family car market until the launch of its Clarus four-door sedan in 1999 – a year behind schedule due to the financial difficulties that Kia was facing before it was taken over by Hyundai. This car was similar in size to the Ford Mondeo and the Opel/Vauxhall Vectra, but, on its launch, was actually less expensive to buy than the smaller Focus and the Astra. It had a spacious interior, large boot, competitive asking price, and high equipment levels, but it had little more appeal to sway buyers away from established European brands like Ford, Vauxhall/Opel and Peugeot.

Its successor, the Magentis, launched in 2001, was still nowhere near as popular as Kia might have hoped it would be, although with a sub-£14,000 asking price it offered the cheapest V6-engined car in the UK, by which time it was rare enough for a six-cylinder car to be priced at less than £20,000.

Kia entered the MPV market in 1999 with the Sedona. On its launch, it was the lowest-priced, full-size people carrier on sale in the United Kingdom. With the range expanded by 1999, sales for that year reached almost 6,400 – more than double the previous year&#x27;s total. That annual sales figure had almost been matched in 2000 by the end of May, reflecting Kia&#x27;s growing popularity with British buyers. By 2009, Kia was firmly established as a popular brand in Britain, when sales broke the 50,000 barrier for the first time and the brand now had a share of more than 2% in the new car market. The Picanto was the most popular single model with nearly 17,000 sales.

In late 2006, Kia opened its first own plant in Europe at a cost of approximately EUR 1.7 billion in Žilina, Slovakia, in the village of Teplička nad Váhom, after construction between October 2004 and December 2005. It has since produced over 2.5 million units of the Kia Cee&#x27;d, Kia Sportage and Kia Venga, as well as seven types of engines. In 2016, 339,500 cars and 612,915 engines were manufactured. The area of the plant is 166 ha and Mobis Slovakia, the largest supplier, is situated right on the carmaker&#x27;s premises. As of December 31, 2016, 3,625 employees worked in the facility, while their average age was 35. The relatively low number of employees working in three shifts is related to a high degree of automation as well as high integration with Mobis Slovakia. In 2016, Kia Motors Slovakia recorded revenue of EUR 5.56 billion. Although the European car market knew significant difficulties, Kia announced increased sales in 2013.

=== Kia Mexico ===
The company has built a $1 billion manufacturing plant in the northern Mexican state of Nuevo León, which produces 300,000 cars a year. Details of the factory, built in the city of Pesquería, were revealed in a joint press conference given by Kia CEO Hyoung-Keun Lee and the President of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto in Mexico City on August 28, 2014. The plant was expected to be completed in the first half of 2016. This factory is involved in controversies because it was built on unevenly purchased land, and the construction agreement was made with advantage conditions and out of the local dispositions to Kia.

=== Kia India ===

The company entered the Indian market in July 2019 with their &#x27;Made for India&#x27; SUV- SP2 Concept now announced as the global mid-sized SUV Kia Seltos. N. Chandrababu Naidu is lauded to have signed an MOU for the government of Andhra Pradesh which came to be one of the biggest FDI&#x27;s with a total investment of Rs.12,900 crore. The company has built a production facility on a Greenfield land in Anantpur district, Andhra Pradesh near Penukonda. The annual production capacity is 350,000 units.

Kia has appointed Kookhyun Shim as MD &amp; CEO for its Indian arm. In his new role, Shim will be responsible for leading the carmaker&#x27;s expansion in the Indian market. He also oversaw the construction of Kia&#x27;s first manufacturing facility in India, to help strengthen the company&#x27;s position in the fifth largest global automotive market. Kia has committed to investments of $1.1 billion to develop operations in India including investing in a network of over 250 customer touch-points that include service, sales and spares establishments.

On 31 July 2020, Kia crossed 100,000 car sales in India becoming the fastest car manufacturer to do so.

=== Lucky Motor Corporation ===

Lucky Motor Corporation (LMC) is an automobile assembler and distributor in Pakistan owned by the Yunus Brothers Group. Originally known as Kia Lucky Motors Pakistan, the company began selling cars in 2018 when they launched their All New Grand Carnival in Pakistan. In quarter 4 2019, Kia Lucky Motors Pakistan introduced two new locally manufactured products known as the Kia Sportage and Kia Picanto.

=== Kia Russia ===
Kia holds a 30% stake in the Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Rus plant in St. Petersburg which is being sold in December 2023 following the problems associated with the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The contract includes a two year buy back clause. In 2022, the company&#x27;s revenue amounted to 111 billion rubles.

=== Kia Defense ===

Kia Motors has specialized in the production of military vehicles with variants and other transportation equipment and by supplying them as a sole maker of military vehicles designated by the South Korean Government since 1976, when Kia Heavy Industry Co. Ltd. (now known as Hyundai Wia) was established. Kia is currently designing a Kaiser Jeep M715-type vehicle named the KM450 for the South Korean Army on license from the U.S. Government. Kia is also the owner of the former ex-Asia Motors factory in Gwangju.

== Design emphasis ==
Beginning in 2006 Kia identified design as its &quot;core future growth engine&quot; – leading to the 2006 hiring of Peter Schreyer and to the 2005 hiring Tom Kearns as Chief Design Officer. Schreyer had previously worked at Audi (designing the Audi TT) and Volkswagen and had won the Design Award of the Federal Republic of Germany. Kearns had previously worked at Cadillac as Chief Design Officer and was responsible for influencing Cadillac&#x27;s direction of hard angles and sharp lines within their design. Schreyer has since been central to a complete restyling of Kia&#x27;s line-up, overseeing design activities at Kia&#x27;s design centers in Frankfurt, Los Angeles, Tokyo, and the Namyang Design Center in South Korea.

With the Kee concept vehicle, shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2007, Kia introduced a new corporate grille to create a recognizable &#x27;face&#x27; for the brand. Known as the &quot;Tiger Nose&quot;, Schreyer indicated he wanted &quot;a powerful visual signal, a seal, an identifier. The front of a car needs this recognition, this expression. A car needs a face and I think the new Kia face is strong and distinctive. Visibility is vital and that face should immediately allow you to identify a Kia even from a distance.&quot; Schreyer described how the Kia Tiger Nose came to be as he explained, &quot;I was just working on the car and just thinking about different possibilities, and suddenly I found it.&quot; Commenting on the new signature grille in 2009: &quot;From now on, we&#x27;ll have it on all our cars&quot;. Kia has since featured the Tiger Nose on all of their vehicles, ranging from the compact Kia Soul, on to the new design of the Kia Optima, and to the larger SUV, the Kia Telluride. Kia cars won the &quot;Road &amp; Travel Magazine&quot; International Car of the Year award in 2013, 2014 and 2015.

== Controversies ==

=== United States Environmental Protection Agency ===
In late 2012, Kia Motors was forced to admit error in inflating its United States Environmental Protection Agency mileage claims and had to reduce its fuel economy claims in the U.S. by about 3 percent across the board and to offer compensation to previous vehicle buyers.

=== Nuevo León plant ===
Since 2014, Kia Motors has been involved in controversies in Mexico due to alleged irregularities in the construction of one of its manufacturing plants, located in the municipality of Pesquería, Nuevo León. The construction of the plant was done in an irregularly purchased land agreement between Kia Motors Mexico and the State of Nuevo León, then headed by Rodrigo Medina de la Cruz, was signed with unfairly advantageous conditions, such as bigger tax incentives than those allowed by Mexican law (tax exemptions for 20 years when the standard is 5), extended to the Mexican providers of Kia.

A copy of the full agreement was published on Facebook by current Nuevo León governor, Jaime Rodríguez Calderón, as part of a prosecution case against Medina and he declared that the signed agreement with his predecessor would be cancelled. A new agreement was then reached with Rodriguez&#x27;s administration in June 2016. Former governor Medina de la Cruz and 30 other officials of the former state administration were investigated by an anti-corruption prosecutor for alleged embezzlement, improper exercise of public functions and damage to Nuevo León State assets. Medina was then taken into custody on January 26, 2017, in relation to this case and others in which he is involved.

=== Kia Challenge ===

In 2022, a trend known as the Kia Challenge went viral on the social media platform TikTok. The TikTok challenge involves stealing certain models of Kia and Hyundai cars manufactured from 2010 to 2021. Certain Kia and Hyundai were reportedly manufactured without immobilizers making the vehicles easier to steal. Kia responded by offering a free software update to affected models which requires the vehicle to have a key in the ignition in order for it to start. They also distributed over 26,000 steering wheel locks to law enforcement agencies to provide to owners of affected models. In February 2023, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported that the challenge had resulted in at least 14 crashes and eight deaths.

In May 2023, following a class action lawsuit, Kia and Hyundai agreed to pay $200 million settlement to consumers who suffered losses as a result of the security flaws. However, on August 16, 2023, a federal judge rejected the proposed settlement.

<text>Bryne (, ) is a town in Time municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. The town is the administrative centre of the municipality of Time and it is also one of the 50 largest towns/cities in Norway. Bryne&#x27;s location in the region of Stavanger/Sandnes and its road and rail links have made Bryne a popular area for commuters. The town is expanding rapidly and there have been reports of problems with schooling capacity. Bryne Church is located in the centre of the town and Time Church is located east of the town .

Bryne is located on the southern shores of the lake Frøylandsvatnet, about 30 minutes south of the city of Stavanger by train. The town has a population (2021) of 12,465 and a population density of . The town&#x27;s urban area crosses over the municipal border to Klepp Municipality, with and 1,800 residents living in the neighboring municipality.

==History==
The village of Bryne was founded as &quot;Thime Stasjon&quot;, since this was the location of the Thime Station along the Jærbanen railroad going from Stavanger to Egersund. The small village was one of many popping up around the new stations on the railroad that was completed in 1878. A new chapel was soon built, as well as a store, a wool-processing factory and a dairy farm.

Several industries related to agriculture also emerged, producing ploughs, mowers and harvesting equipment. Many years later in 1949, the first excavator in Europe with complete hydraulic transmission of power, the &quot;Brøyt&quot;, was introduced by the two brothers Kristian and Ingebret Søyland. Also the company Tralfa developed the world&#x27;s first spray-paint robot. Today, Tralfa is part of ABB.

Gradually, Bryne developed into a regional education center, with a dairy school established in 1906, the National Grammar School (&quot;Rogaland Landsgymnas&quot;) in 1924, and later a vocational school was also established. In 1921, the name of &quot;Thime Station&quot; was changed to &quot;Bryne&quot; by referendum. Bryne has since grown rapidly to become Jæren&#x27;s most densely populated rural area and a regional trade center. On 1 January 2001, the municipality granted Bryne town status, the 49th largest settlement in Norway at the time.

==Shopping==
Bryne has three shopping malls. They are &quot;Torgsenteret&quot;, &quot;Brynetorget&quot;, and &quot;M44&quot; which is the newest and second largest in Rogaland. There is also a shopping street called &quot;Storgata&quot; (&quot;Main Street&quot;) where there are several clothing shops, book shops, and sports wear shops, including special designer clothes shops that sell wares that can only be found in here.

==Culture==
===Fritz Røed Park===
The Fritz Røed Park was officially opened 1 October 2004. It is a collection of sculptures made by the sculptor Fritz Røed, who was born in Bryne. The sculptures are all placed in and around the river which flows through the park.

===Garborg Centre===
The Garborg Centre () opened in 2012. It is a museum and educational centre dedicated to the author couple Arne Garborg and Hulda Garborg. It aims to encourage people&#x27;s interest for the ideas and visions of the two authors. The centre will encourage visitors to take a more active part in today&#x27;s society, and inspire them to read and develop their own creativity.

===Bryne Mølle===
 &quot;Bryne Mølle&quot; (Bryne Mill) is an old mill now used for concerts and art exhibitions. The original mill burnt down in 1928. Today&#x27;s building is dated from 1929. Ranglerock Festival is an annual rockfestival that has been arranged in there since 2005.

===Kaizers Orchestra===
The rock band Kaizers Orchestra originated in Bryne. The two founders of the band, vocalist Janove Ottesen and guitarist Geir Zahl are from Bryne.

==Sport==
Bryne FK played in the Norwegian premier league from 1976 to 1988, and from 2000 to 2003, and now plays in 1. divisjon, the second tier of Norwegian football. In 1987 the team won the National Football Cup and reached the final again in 2001.

Bryne is the childhood home of renowned striker Erling Haaland, where he grew up and learned to play football.

The football clubs Kåsen IL and Rosseland BK are also based in Bryne.

Bryne also has a karate club. The club has produced both national victories and international victories. It is among the biggest karate clubs in Norway.

<text>A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.

Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated. Crushing is the process of transferring a force amplified by mechanical advantage through a material made of molecules that bond together more strongly, and resist deformation more, than those in the material being crushed do. Crushing devices hold material between two parallel or tangent solid surfaces, and apply sufficient force to bring the surfaces together to generate enough energy within the material being crushed so that its molecules separate from (fracturing), or change alignment in relation to (deformation), each other. The earliest crushers were hand-held stones, where the weight of the stone provided a boost to muscle power, used against a stone anvil. Querns and mortars are types of these crushing devices.

==Background history==

In industry, crushers are machines which use a metal surface to break or compress materials into small fractional chunks or denser masses. Throughout most of industrial history, the greater part of crushing and mining part of the process occurred under muscle power as the application of force concentrated in the tip of the miners pick or sledge hammer driven drill bit. Before explosives came into widespread use in bulk mining in the mid-nineteenth century, most initial ore crushing and sizing was by hand and hammers at the mine or by water powered trip hammers in the small charcoal fired smithies and iron works typical of the Renaissance through the early-to-middle Industrial Revolution. It was only after explosives, and later early powerful steam shovels produced large chunks of materials, chunks originally reduced by hammering in the mine before being loaded into sacks for a trip to the surface, chunks that were eventually also to lead to rails and mine railways transporting bulk aggregations that post-mine face crushing became widely necessary. The earliest of these were in the foundries, but as coal took hold the larger operations became the coal breakers that fueled industrial growth from the first decade of the 1600s to the replacement of breakers in the 1970s through the fuel needs of the present day. The gradual coming of that era and displacement of the cottage industry based economies was itself accelerated first by the utility of wrought and cast iron as a desired materials giving impetus to larger operations, then in the late-sixteenth century by the increasing scarcity of wood lands for charcoal production to make the newfangled window glass material that had become—along with the chimney—&quot; &#x27;all the rage&#x27;  &quot; among the growing middle-class and affluence of the sixteenth-and-seventeenth centuries;and as always, the charcoal needed to smelt metals, especially to produce ever larger amounts of brass and bronze, pig iron, cast iron and wrought iron demanded by the new consumer classes. Other metallurgical developments such as silver and gold mining mirrored the practices and developments of the bulk material handling methods and technologies feeding the burgeoning appetite for more and more iron and glass, both of which were rare in personal possessions until the 1700s. 
Things only became worse when the English figured out how to cast the more economical iron cannons (1547), following on their feat of becoming the armorers of the European continent&#x27;s powers by having been leading producers of brass and bronze guns, and eventually by various acts of Parliament, gradually banned or restricted the further cutting of trees for charcoal in larger and larger regions in the United Kingdom. In 1611, a consortium led by courtier Edward Zouch was granted a patent for the reverberatory furnace, a furnace using coal, not precious national timber reserves, which was immediately employed in glass making. An early politically connected and wealthy Robber Baron figure Sir Robert Mansell bought his way into the fledgling furnace company and wrested control of it, and by 1615 managed to have James I issue a proclamation forbidding the use of wood to produce glass, giving his family&#x27;s extensive coal holdings a monopoly on both source and means of production for nearly half-a-century. Abraham Darby a century later relocated to Bristol where he had established a building brass and bronze industry by importing Dutch workers and using them to raid Dutch techniques. Both materials were considered superior to iron for cannon, and machines as they were better understood. But Darby would change the world in several key ways.
Where the Dutch had failed in casting iron, one of Darby&#x27;s apprentices, John Thomas succeeded in 1707 and as Burke put it: &quot;&quot;had given England the key to the Industrial Revolution&quot;&quot;. At the time, mines and foundries were virtually all small enterprises except for the tin mines (driven by the price and utility of brass) and materials came out of the mines already hammered small by legions of miners who had to stuff their work into carry sacks for pack animal slinging. Concurrently, mines needed drainage resulting in Savery and Newcomen&#x27;s early steam driven pumping systems. The deeper the mines went, the larger the demand became for better pumps, the greater the demand for iron, the greater the need for coal, the greater the demand for each. Seeing ahead clearly, Darby, sold off his brass business interests and relocated to Coalbrookdale with its plentiful coal mines, water power and nearby ore supplies. Over that decade his foundries developed iron casting technologies and began to supplant other metals in many applications. He adapted Coking of his fuel by copying Brewers practices. In 1822, the pumping industries needs for larger cylinders met up with Darby&#x27;s ability to melt sufficient quantities of pig iron to cast large inexpensive iron cylinders instead of costly brass ones, reducing the cost of cylinders by nine-tenths. 
With gunpowder being increasingly applied to mining, rock chunks from a mining face became much larger, and the blast dependent mining itself had become dependent upon an organized group, not just an individual swinging a pick. Economies of scale gradually infused industrial enterprises, while transport became a key bottleneck as the volume of moved materials continued to increase following demand. This spurred numerous canal projects, inspired laying first wooden, then iron protected rails using draft animals to pull loads in the emerging bulk goods transportation dependent economy. In the coal industry, which grew as coal became the preferred fuel for smelting ores, crushing and preparation (cleaning) was performed for over a hundred years in coal breakers, massive noisy buildings full of conveyors, belt-powered trip-hammer crushing stages and giant metal grading/sorting grates. Like mine pumps, the internal conveyors and trip-hammers were housed within these 7—11 storey buildings.

==Industrial use==
Mining operations use crushers, commonly classified by the degree to which they fragment the starting material, with primary and secondary crushers handling coarse materials, and tertiary and quaternary crushers reducing ore particles to finer gradations. Each crusher is designed to work with a certain maximum size of raw material, and often delivers its output to a screening machine which sorts and directs the product for further processing. As well as size, machines designed for each of these stages must take into account the basic methods of material size reduction; impact, compression, attrition, and cutting. Depending on the material properties and desired outcome some methods of crushing and thus machines designs may be more appropriate for the use case.

Typically, crushing stages are followed by milling stages if the materials need to be further reduced. Additionally rock breakers are typically located next to a crusher to reduce oversize material too large for a crusher. Crushers are used to reduce particle size enough so that the material can be processed into finer particles in a grinder. A typical processing line at a mine might consist of a crusher followed by a SAG mill followed by a ball mill. In this context, the SAG mill and ball mill are considered grinders rather than crushers.

In operation, the raw material (of various sizes) is usually delivered to the primary crusher&#x27;s hopper by dump trucks, excavators or wheeled front-end loaders. A feeder device such as an apron feeder, conveyor or vibrating grid controls the rate at which this material enters the crusher, and often contains a preliminary screening device which allows smaller material to bypass the crusher itself, thus improving efficiency. Primary crushing reduces the large pieces to a size which can be handled by the downstream machinery.

Some crushers are mobile and can crush rocks as large as 1.5 meter (60 inches). Primarily used in-pit at the mine face these units are able to move with the large infeed machines (mainly shovels) to increase the tonnage produced. In a mobile road operation, these crushed rocks are directly combined with concrete, and asphalt which are then deposited on to a road surface. This removes the need for hauling oversized material to a stationary crusher and then back to the road surface. Additionally, Small/Mini Crushers (approx 6,000 to 60,000 pound range) are portable crushers typically used by travelling from jobsite-to-jobsite. These small crusher may be track or wheel mounted, gas, diesel, or electrically powered, but are primarily of the Jaw Crusher variety.

==Types of crushers==
 
The following table describes typical uses of commonly used crushers:
===Jaw crusher===
A jaw crusher uses compressive force for breaking of particle. This mechanical pressure is achieved by the two jaws of the crusher of which one is fixed while the other reciprocates. A jaw or toggle crusher consists of a set of vertical jaws, one jaw is kept stationary and is called a fixed jaw while the other jaw called a swing jaw, moves back and forth relative to it, by a cam or pitman mechanism, acting like a class II lever or a nutcracker. The volume or cavity between the two jaws is called the crushing chamber. The movement of the swing jaw can be quite small, since complete crushing is not performed in one stroke. The inertia required to crush the material is provided by a flywheel that moves a shaft creating an eccentric motion that causes the closing of the gap.

Jaw crushers are heavy duty machines and hence need to be robustly constructed. The outer frame is generally made of cast iron or steel. The jaws themselves are usually constructed from cast steel. They are fitted with replaceable liners which are made of manganese steel, or Ni-hard (a Ni-Cr alloyed cast iron). Jaw crushers are usually constructed in sections to ease the process transportation if they are to be taken underground for carrying out the operations.

Jaw crushers are classified on the basis of the position of the pivoting of the swing jaw
# Blake crusher-the swing jaw is fixed at the lower position
# Dodge crusher-the swing jaw is fixed at the upper position
# Universal crusher-the swing jaw is fixed at an intermediate position

The Blake crusher was patented by Eli Whitney Blake in 1858. The Blake type jaw crusher has a fixed feed area and a variable discharge area. Blake crushers are of two types- single toggle and double toggle jaw crushers.

In the single toggle jaw crushers, the swing jaw is suspended on the eccentric shaft which leads to a much more compact design than that of the double toggle jaw crusher. The swing jaw, suspended on the eccentric, undergoes two types of motion- swing motion towards the fixed jaw due to the action of toggle plate and vertical movement due to the rotation of the eccentric. These two motions, when combined, lead to an elliptical jaw motion. This motion is useful as it assists in pushing the particles through the crushing chamber. This phenomenon leads to higher capacity of the single toggle jaw crushers but it also results in higher wear of the crushing jaws. These type of jaw crushers are preferred for the crushing of softer particles.

In the double toggle jaw crushers, the oscillating motion of the swing jaw is caused by the vertical motion of the pitman. The pitman moves up and down. The swing jaw closes, i.e., it moves towards the fixed jaw when the pitman moves upward and opens during the downward motion of the pitman. This type is commonly used in mines due to its ability to crush tough and abrasive materials.

In the Dodge type jaw crushers, the jaws are farther apart at the top than at the bottom, forming a tapered chute so that the material is crushed progressively smaller and smaller as it travels downward until it is small enough to escape from the bottom opening. The Dodge jaw crusher has a variable feed area and a fixed discharge area which leads to choking of the crusher and hence is used only for laboratory purposes and not for heavy duty operations.

===Gyratory crusher===

A gyratory crusher is similar in basic concept to a jaw crusher, consisting of a concave surface and a conical head; both surfaces are typically lined with manganese steel surfaces. The inner cone has a slight circular movement, but does not rotate; the movement is generated by an eccentric arrangement. As with the jaw crusher, material travels downward between the two surfaces being progressively crushed until it is small enough to fall out through the gap between the two surfaces.

A gyratory crusher is one of the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore processing plant. Gyratory crushers are designated in size either by the gape and mantle diameter or by the size of the receiving opening. Gyratory crushers can be used for primary or secondary crushing. The crushing action is caused by the closing of the gap between the mantle line (movable) mounted on the central vertical spindle and the concave liners (fixed) mounted on the main frame of the crusher. The gap is opened and closed by an eccentric on the bottom of the spindle that causes the central vertical spindle to gyrate. The vertical spindle is free to rotate around its own axis. The crusher illustrated is a short-shaft suspended spindle type, meaning that the main shaft is suspended at the top and that the eccentric is mounted above the gear. The short-shaft design has superseded the long-shaft design in which the eccentric is mounted below the gear.

===Cone crusher===
With the rapid development of mining technology, the cone crusher can be divided into four types: compound cone crusher, spring cone crusher, hydraulic cone crusher and gyratory crusher. According to different models, the cone crusher is divided into vertical shaft cone (VSC) series cone crusher (compound cone crusher), Symons cone crusher, PY cone crusher, single cylinder hydraulic cone crusher, multi-cylinder hydraulic cone crusher, gyratory crusher, etc.

A cone crusher is similar in operation to a gyratory crusher, with less steepness in the crushing chamber and more of a parallel zone between crushing zones. A cone crusher breaks rock by squeezing the rock between an eccentrically gyrating spindle, which is covered by a wear-resistant mantle, and the enclosing concave hopper, covered by a manganese concave or a bowl liner. As rock enters the top of the cone crusher, it becomes wedged and squeezed between the mantle and the bowl liner or concave. Large pieces of ore are broken once, and then fall to a lower position (because they are now smaller) where they are broken again. This process continues until the pieces are small enough to fall through the narrow opening at the bottom of the crusher.

A cone crusher is suitable for crushing a variety of mid-hard and above mid-hard ores and rocks. It has the advantage of reliable construction, high productivity, better granularity and shape of finished products, easy adjustment and lower operational costs. The spring release system of a cone crusher acts an overload protection that allows tramp to pass through the crushing chamber without damage to the crusher.

==== Compound cone crusher ====
Compound cone crusher (VSC series cone crusher) can crush materials of over medium hardness. It is mainly used in mining, chemical industry, road and bridge construction, building, etc. As for VSC series cone crusher, there are four crushing cavities (coarse, medium, fine and superfine) to choose. Compared with the same type, VSC series cone crusher, whose combination of crushing frequency and eccentricity is the best, can make materials have higher comminution degree and higher yield. In addition, VSC series cone crusher&#x27;s enhanced laminating crushing effect on material particles makes the cubic shape of crushed materials better, which increases the selling point.

==== Symons cone crusher ====
Symons cone crusher (spring cone crusher) can crush materials of above medium hardness. And it is widely used in metallurgy, building, hydropower, transportation, chemical industry, etc. When used with jaw crusher, it can be used as secondary, tertiary or quaternary crushing. Generally speaking, the standard type of Symons cone crusher is applied to medium crushing. The medium type is applied to fine crushing. The short head type is applied to coarse fine crushing. As casting steel technique is adopted, the machine has good rigidity and large high strength.

==== Single cylinder hydraulic cone crusher ====
Single cylinder hydraulic cone crusher is mainly composed of main frame, transmission device, eccentric shaft, bowl-shaped bearing, crushing cone, mantle, bowl liner, adjusting device, adjusting sleeve, hydraulic control system, hydraulic safety system, dust-proof ring, feed plate, etc. It is applied to cement mill, mining, building construction, road &amp;bridge construction, railway construction and metallurgy and some other industries.

==== Multi-cylinder hydraulic cone crusher ====
Multi-cylinder hydraulic cone crusher is mainly composed of main frame, eccentric shaft, crushing cone, mantle, bowl liner, adjusting device, dust ring, transmission device, bowl-shaped bearing, adjusting sleeve, hydraulic control system, hydraulic safety system, etc. The electric motor of the cone crusher drives the eccentric shaft to make periodic swing movement under the shaft axis, and consequently surface of mantle approaches and leaves the surface of bowl liner now and then, so that the material is crushed due to squeezing and grinding inside the crushing chamber. The safety cylinder of the machine can ensure safety as well as lift supporting sleeve and static cone by a hydraulic system and automatically remove the blocks in the crushing chamber when the machine is suddenly stuffy. Thus the maintenance rate is greatly reduced and production efficiency is greatly improved as it can remove blocks without disassembling the machine.

===Impact crusher===
Impact crushers involve the use of impact rather than pressure to crush material. The material is contained within a cage, with openings on the bottom, end, or side of the desired size to allow pulverized material to escape. There are two types of impact crushers: horizontal shaft impactor and vertical shaft impactor.

====Horizontal shaft impactor (HSI) / hammermill====
The HSI crushers break rock by impacting the rock with hammers that are fixed upon the outer edge of a spinning rotor. HSI machines are sold in stationary, trailer mounted and crawler mounted configurations. HSI&#x27;s are used in recycling, hard rock and soft materials. In earlier years the practical use of HSI crushers is limited to soft materials and non abrasive materials, such as limestone, phosphate, gypsum, weathered shales, however improvements in metallurgy have changed the application of these machines.

====Mobile crusher====

Mobile crushers are versatile and efficient machines designed for on-site crushing in mining and construction, offering flexibility and mobility to process materials directly at the job site. Mobile crushers are available in various types and configurations:

Mobile Jaw Crushers: These crushers feature a stationary jaw and a movable jaw, enabling primary crushing of materials with varying hardness and abrasiveness.

Mobile Impact Crushers: Impact crushers utilize the principle of rapid impact to crush materials, making them suitable for secondary and tertiary crushing of various rocks and minerals.
Mobile Cone Crushers: Cone crushers employ a cone-shaped crushing chamber, ideal for producing finely crushed aggregates and sands for construction and mining applications.

Mobile Vertical Shaft Impact (VSI) Crushers: VSI crushers utilize a high-speed rotor with wear-resistant tips to crush materials, offering superior shaping capabilities for producing high-quality aggregates with excellent particle shape.

Mobile Jaw and Cone Combination Crushers: These crushers combine the features of jaw and cone crushers, offering versatility and efficiency for processing diverse materials in various applications.

====Vertical shaft impactor (VSI)====
VSI crushers use a different approach involving a high speed rotor with wear resistant tips and a crushing chamber designed to &#x27;throw&#x27; the rock against. The VSI crushers utilize velocity rather than surface force as the predominant force to break rock. In its natural state, rock has a jagged and uneven surface. Applying surface force (pressure) results in unpredictable and typically non-cubical resulting particles. Utilizing velocity rather than surface force allows the breaking force to be applied evenly both across the surface of the rock as well as through the mass of the rock. Rock, regardless of size, has natural fissures (faults) throughout its structure. As rock is &#x27;thrown&#x27; by a VSI rotor against a solid anvil, it fractures and breaks along these fissures. Final particle size can be controlled by 1) the velocity at which the rock is thrown against the anvil and 2) the distance between the end of the rotor and the impact point on the anvil. The product resulting from VSI crushing is generally of a consistent cubical shape such as that required by modern Superpave highway asphalt applications. Using this method also allows materials with much higher abrasiveness to be crushed than is capable with an HSI and most other crushing methods.

VSI crushers generally utilize a high speed spinning rotor at the center of the crushing chamber and an outer impact surface of either abrasive resistant metal anvils or crushed rock. Utilizing cast metal surfaces &#x27;anvils&#x27; is traditionally referred to as a &quot;shoe and anvil VSI&quot;. Utilizing crushed rock on the outer walls of the crusher for new rock to be crushed against is traditionally referred to as &quot;rock on rock VSI&quot;. VSI crushers can be used in static plant set-up or in mobile tracked equipment.

===Mineral sizers===

Mineral sizers are a variety of &quot;roll crushers&quot; which use two rotors with large teeth, on small diameter shafts, driven at a low speed by a direct high torque drive system. This design produced three-stage breaking action which all interact when breaking materials using sizer technology.

* The gripping: at the first stage, the material is gripped by the leading faces of opposed rotor teeth. These subject the rock to multiple point loading, inducing stress into the material to exploit any natural weaknesses. At the second stage, material is broken in tension by being subjected to a three-point loading, applied between the front tooth faces on one rotor, and rear tooth faces on the other rotor. Any lumps of material that still remain oversize, are broken as the rotors chop through the fixed teeth of the breaker bar, thereby achieving a three dimensional controlled product size.
* The rotating screen effect: The interlaced toothed rotor design allows free flowing undersize material to pass through the continuously changing gaps generated by the relatively slow moving shafts.
* The deep scroll tooth pattern: The deep scroll conveys the larger material to one end of the machine and helps to spread the feed across the full length of the rotors. This feature can also be used to reject oversize material from the machine.

Their primary advantage is a compact geometry and size which is valuable in mining industry, .e.g. in underground hard-rock mining.

===Crusher bucket===

A crusher bucket is an attachment for hydraulic excavators. Its way of working consists on a bucket with two crushing jaws inside, one of them is fixed and the other one moves back and forth relative to it, as in a jaw crusher. They are manufactured with a high inertia power train, circular jaw movement and an anti-stagnation plate, which prevents large shredding pieces from getting stuck in the bucket&#x27;s mouth, not allowing them to enter the crushing jaws. They have also the crushing jaws placed in a cross position. This position together with its circular motion gives these crusher buckets the faculty of grinding wet material.
==Technology==
For the most part advances in crusher design have moved slowly. Jaw crushers have remained virtually unchanged for sixty years. More reliability and higher production have been added to basic cone crusher designs that have also remained largely unchanged. Increases in rotating speed have provided the largest variation. For instance, a 48-inch (120 cm) cone crusher manufactured in 1960 may be able to produce 170 tons/h of crushed rock, whereas the same size crusher manufactured today may produce 300 tons/h. These production improvements come from speed increases and better crushing chamber designs.

The largest advance in cone crusher reliability has been seen in the use of hydraulics to protect crushers from being damaged when uncrushable objects enter the crushing chamber. Foreign objects, such as steel, can cause extensive damage to a cone crusher, and additional costs in lost production. The advance of hydraulic relief systems has greatly reduced downtime and improved the life of these machines.

Due to safety requirements and the weight of the jaws, many companies and OEM providers have produced a suite of lifting tools to safely install and fit these tools into the crusher. In many countries, the lifting tool is mandatory due to legislative and policy-based safety requirements.

<text>Bryne Fotballklubb () is a professional football club located in Bryne, Norway, which competes in the Eliteserien, the top tier of Norwegian football. Founded on 10 April 1926 as Bryne Fotball-lag, the club joined the Norwegian Football Federation in 1929 and has played its home matches at Bryne Stadion since 1945.

==History==
===Foundation and early years (1926–1946)===
Prior to 1937, the club did not maintain formal records, resulting in limited documentation of its early history. The team&#x27;s activities initially consisted of private matches until 1929, when Bryne played its first official fixture against the neighboring club Klepp, ending in a 4–4 draw.

During its early years, Bryne played its home matches on various pastures throughout the Jæren region, with the location of the playing fields often determined by grazing conditions. For much of the 1930s and early 1940s, the club used a small, rented field next to Bryne Mill. Towards the end of the 1930s, the club acquired the site that would become its permanent home, Bryne Stadion. In 1945, after years of playing on borrowed grounds, the club completed the construction of its own stadium. Upon its inauguration in September 1946, Bryne Stadion featured a grass pitch that was among the largest in Norway, a marked improvement from the dimensions of the Bryne Mill field, which measured just 85 by 55 meters.

In 1937, Bryne secured the district championship by defeating Vard Haugesund 3–1 in the final. Notable players from this period included Leonard Lura, brothers Sigurd, Ingvar, and Bjarne Løge, Kåre Hansen, and Bjarne Thu.

Football activities were largely suspended during World War II, though some matches were played clandestinely. Following the war, Bryne experienced renewed success. In 1946, the junior team claimed the Western Norway championship with a 2–1 victory over Pallas in Bergen. Many players from this junior team would go on to form the backbone of the senior squad for years to come. Key players from this era included Laurits B. and Odd H. Sirevaag, Karl Vaaland, and Martin and Kåre Thu, with Laurits B. Sirevaag emerging as a particularly significant figure in the team&#x27;s development.

=== Local league and rise to national top tier (1949–1975) ===
In 1949, Bryne won the local third tier, earning promotion to the local second tier. The club continued to progress, achieving promotion to the local first tier in 1964 after several near misses. Key players during this era included Kjell Lura, Kristian Hamre, Olav Sigbjørnsen, Gaute Skrudland, Per Undheim, Tor Jan Skretting, Aasbjørn Aasland, Reidar Omdal, Torbjørn Reime, Magnus Grødem, Bjarne Undheim, and Johannes Vold. Since then, Bryne has consistently competed at the middle and top levels of Norwegian football.

In the early 1970s, Bryne faced relegation to the third division for a season, necessitating a period of renewal. A promising youth team emerged during this time, winning the county championship with a decisive 10–1 victory over Sola in the final. Many of these young talents later became pivotal members of the squad that achieved promotion to the top division in 1975.

Although Bryne had come close to reaching the national first division on multiple occasions, they often faltered in the final stages. Ahead of the 1975 season, the club set a clear goal of securing direct promotion to the first division. To achieve this, Gustav Hult returned as head coach, training sessions increased from three to four per week, and funds were allocated for a summer training camp for players and their families. The squad was further bolstered by the addition of three new players: Charles Tjessem from Figgjo, Arild Aadnesen from Nærbø, and Nils Steinsland from Orre. Additionally, three junior players—Kjell Tjåland, Gunnar Orre, and Jan Øvernes—were promoted to the first team, further strengthening the team.

The 1975 season began strongly for Bryne, with victories over Ålesund, Frigg, and Lyn. By the midway point of the season, Bryne led the league with 16 points. Their closest competitors were Vard Haugesund, featuring players Arne Larsen Økland and Rune Ottesen, with 13 points, and Steinkjer with 12 points. As the season progressed, Vard Haugesund and Lyn maintained a strong run of form, closing in on Bryne with only two matches remaining.

In the penultimate round, Bryne faced Vard Haugesund at Haugesund Stadium in what was effectively a promotion decider. Bryne, leading the league by a single point, needed a win to secure their position. The match, witnessed by a crowd of over 12,000 spectators, ended in a 1–0 victory for Bryne, with Nils Steinsland scoring the decisive goal through a header midway through the first half.

The season concluded the following weekend with Bryne hosting Hødd. A commanding 3–0 victory sealed the team&#x27;s promotion. Bryne finished the season with 32 points from 18 games, achieving 15 wins, 2 draws, and only 1 loss, with an impressive goal difference of 41–10. Vard Haugesund finished second with 29 points and earned promotion through qualification matches.

=== Years in top tier and cup win (1976–1987) ===
Bryne had a successful run in the 1970s and 1980s. In the first season of the top division in 1976, Gustav Hult served as coach and managed to keep the team in the league, finishing 9th. The following three seasons were led by Kjell Schou-Andreassen, who had previously achieved success with Viking and as a national team coach. Under his leadership, Bryne steadily improved and finished in 4th place in the league in 1979, just two points behind the bronze medal position.

In 1980, Englishman Brian Green took over as coach and brought with him a new training and football philosophy that emphasized lighter training sessions and more ball play. He led Bryne to two silver medals in the league in 1980 and 1982 and subsequent European Cup appearances. While Green played a significant role in these successes, it was built upon the foundation laid by Schou-Andreassen in the previous years.

In 1983, Kent Karlsson from Sweden took over as coach and led the team for three seasons, achieving a 4th place finish in the league in 1984.

Before the 1986 season, Bjarne Berntsen was appointed as the new coach on a long-term contract. In his first year, Bryne finished 6th in the league and made it to the 4th round of the cup. The following year, the team seemed poised for great success, with three rounds left in the league they were still in contention for the title and had already secured a place in the cup final. However, they faltered in the last few matches and ultimately finished in 5th place behind Moss, Molde, Kongsvinger, and Rosenborg.

After trailing 0–2 against Rosenborg in the semi-finals of the cup at Lerkendal, Bryne managed to turn the game in their favor. Bryne eventually won 2–3 and the club was ready for their first cup final.

Their opponent was Brann, and Bryne lost the draw for jersey colors, and had to play with white tops. The game ended 0–0 after regular time. The first extra time was almost over when Bryne defender Kolbjørn Ekker put the ball behind Brann goalkeeper Bjarni Sigurðsson. The second extra time ended goalless and Bryne could celebrate the club&#x27;s first title in its 61-year history.

=== Relegation from top tier (1988–1998) ===
1988 turned out to be a disastrous year. The reigning cup champions were knocked out in the third round. There was also relegation from Eliteserien after a qualification match against Start. The match was played at Stavanger Stadion with thousands of Viking fans in the stands dressed in yellow and black, as Bryne Stadium was under renovation. Although Berntsen had a long-term contract, his coaching engagement was terminated after the 1988 season.

In 1989, Arne Larsen Økland was hired as coach, with Trond Sirevåg as assistant coach. Although neither of them had extensive coaching experience, it was expected that with their playing experience and experience from several talented coaches, they would be a good choice. The season was reasonably good, almost earning a qualification spot. The same two continued into the following season, which resulted in a qualification spot, but with a loss to Lillestrøm in the final qualifying match, and remained in the 1. divisjon.

There was now a change of coach, with Kjell Tennfjord being hired. He had coaching experience from the Eliteserien. Trond Sirevåg continued as assistant coach. This duo coached the team in 1991 and 1992, with a qualification spot in 1991 being the best result. However, a loss to Brann in the final and decisive match meant they missed out. In 1993, there was another change of coach, with Gary Goodchild being appointed with Birk Engstrøm as assistant coach. They achieved a qualification spot, but again lost in the final and decisive match away against Strømsgodset. After this season, some key players left. The following season Bryne gained few points, and towards the end of the season they were close to relegation. The coach and assistant coach were replaced, with Trond Sirevåg becoming the head coach and Tor Fosse the assistant coach. The place in the division was saved in the final match against Vidar in Stavanger. Trond Sirevåg continued in 1995 and 1996, the first year with Geir Olsen and Svein Enersen as assistant coaches and the last year with Geir Olsen as assistant coach. The first year was not particularly successful, but in 1996, they achieved a 3rd place, one spot below qualification.

In 1997, it was time for a new foreigner, Kenneth Rosén was appointed as coach, having experience from a relatively high level both in Sweden and Norway. Rosèn stayed at Bryne until the end of the 2000 season. During his time there, Rosèn achieved good results. The first season was a bit mixed, with the team being close to both the qualifying and relegation places. The second season was a bit better, with the team doing well until August, when they suffered a collapse and ended up in the lower half of the table.

=== Return to top tier and cup final loss (1999–2001) ===
1999 was a successful year, with Bryne being promoted to Eliteserien after an absence of 11 years. The spring season was average, but the fall season was better, securing the team a second-place finish in a dramatic match against Lyn at home. The second-place finish gave Bryne direct promotion to Eliteserien. The first season in Eliteserien was challenging for Bryne. The team was expected to lose from the start and throughout the season, but managed to avoid relegation in the last match against Odd at home.

Before the 2001 season, Rosèn left Bryne and Erik Brakstad was hired as the new coach. Brakstad was an experienced coach with good results from Eliteserien, and optimism was high. However, it was a troubled season in many ways, and Brakstad left the club before the halfway point. Assistant coach Hans Olav Frette took over together with former Bryne player Gabriel Høyland, until the Swede Reine Almqvist with coaching experience from both Norway and Sweden was hired. Hans Olav Frette continued as assistant coach.

The season was a struggle, with the club being a bottom team for most of the year. It was not until the last match of the season that they secured a place in the qualification round, and through the qualification, they secured a spot in Eliteserien. However, the team did much better in the cup competition, reaching the final, which they lost 3–0 to Viking.

=== Return to second tier (2002–2015) ===
Almqvist continued as coach in 2002 and 2003. The first of these years was good, with a 9th place finish in Eliteserien and reaching the 4th round of the cup. The 2003 season was another disaster, with the team not winning any away matches, finishing last in Eliteserien and being knocked out in the 3rd round of the cup. This meant another relegation from Eliteserien after four seasons.

Hans Olav Frette took over as head coach in 2004 with Asle Andersen and Gabriel Høyland as assistants. The team started with a clean slate and many new local players. They were reasonably satisfied with a 7th place finish in the league and reaching the quarterfinals of the cup. Frette continued as coach with Andersen as assistant in 2005, resulting in a 5th place finish in the league and reaching the 4th round of the cup. After this season, Frette resigned and a new Swede, Magnus Johanson, took over as coach, with Andersen continuing as assistant. He was later replaced by Kenneth Eidsaunet during the season. The season resulted in a 3rd place finish and a qualification round for Eliteserien, as well as reaching the 4th round of the cup. However, they lost both qualification matches against Odd.

The 2007 season did not go as expected. Coach Magnus Johannson resigned after the spring season, and Hans Olav Frette took over. Kenneth Eidsaunet continued as assistant coach. The team ended up in 6th place in the league and reached the 3rd round of the cup.

Before the 2008 season, Rolf Teigen was hired as coach, with Mathias Haugaasen as analyst and assistant, Erik Fuglestad as player developer, and Kurt Hegre as goalkeeper coach. Despite the investment, the season was not successful. The team finished 11th in the league and reached the 3rd place in the cup.

The 2009 season began with the same coaching team. After a poor start with lackluster results (last place) and dull play, the coaching duo of Teigen and Haugaasen were dismissed in May. During a transitional period, the team was led by Trond Sirevåg and Gabriel Høyland. Mons Ivar Mjelde was hired as head coach in August, with Øystein Tveit as assistant coach. After Mons Ivar Mjelde&#x27;s arrival, the team gained momentum and steadily collected points, eventually finishing in 8th place. In the cup, they were eliminated in the 4th round after beating Viking in a dramatic 3rd round match that was decided on penalties. Mons Ivar Mjelde&#x27;s role as coach ended after the end of the season.

Before the 2010 season, former Bryne player Tommy Bergersen was hired as head coach, with Erik Fuglestad as assistant coach and Kurt Hegre as goalkeeper coach. Since Bergersen lacked coaching experience in the top divisions and had limited financial resources at his disposal, expectations for the season were not too high. The season started well, but as time went on, the team struggled to collect points. They were in the relegation battle throughout the autumn, but some late wins secured a safe 9th place finish.

=== Relegation from second tier and return (2016–present) ===
The 2016 season can be described as extremely turbulent. During this time, the academy player Erling Haaland was promoted to the first team and played 16 games, emerging as a positive contributor to the team&#x27;s performance. After six points in six games, head coach Gaute Larsen was released from his contract. In came Alf Ingve Berntsen. Berntsen led the team in nine games, during which the team picked up five points. Berntsen resigned and was replaced by Ole Hjelmhaug and assistant coach Even Sel. By that time, the team had played 15 games and had only accumulated 11 points. The summer transfer window offered two solid reinforcements. Bajram Ajeti and Marius Helle resolved what had been the team&#x27;s Achilles&#x27; heel throughout the season, namely scoring goals. In addition, Marius Lode was once again ready to play after being banned for illegal use of methylphenidate.

Despite being written off, Bryne fought to stay in the 1. divisjon until the very end. But when the referee blew the final whistle on the final match of the season on 30 October at home against Fredrikstad, relegation was a fact. For the first time since 1973, Bryne was outside of the elite company of the top two levels of Norwegian football.

Ole Hjelmhaug remained as Bryne coach until the end of the 2018 season, but failed to secure promotion. Ahead of the 2019 season, he was replaced by Jan Halvor Halvorsen, while Even Sel continued as assistant coach. Halvorsen initiated a squad overhaul and implemented a 4–3–3 formation, which led to significant changes in the team&#x27;s dynamics. However, Bryne&#x27;s performance in the 2019 season was far from satisfactory, and they ended up in a disappointing 10th place with only 28 points.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a delay in the 2020 league season, eventually leading to an abbreviated season with a single round-robin system followed by a play-off. Bryne emerged as champions, finishing 7 points clear of the second-place team. They managed to win all their home games, securing their promotion to the second tier after spending four seasons in the third tier. Halvorsen continued as coach for the following season, successfully securing a place in the second tier with a 10th place finish. Upon the expiry of Halvorsen&#x27;s contract ahead of the 2021 season, Kevin Knappen was appointed as his replacement. 

Bryne concluded the 2024 season by achieving direct promotion to the Eliteserien. Although their early form was inconsistent, a run of crucial victories during the summer propelled the club into a strong position in the league table. Defensive stability and steady goal-scoring proved decisive in sustaining their momentum through the final rounds of competition.

Promotion was officially secured on 2 November in a home win against local rivals Egersunds IK, a result that guaranteed Bryne second place in the table.

Bryne has spent a total of 17 seasons in the top flight of Norwegian football since their debut in 1976. Their longest spell was 13 consecutive top tier seasons, from 1976 until 1988. The club&#x27;s last period in the top division lasted for four seasons from 2000 until the 2003 season.

==Stadium==

Bryne Stadion currently has a capacity of 4,000, out of which 2,507 are seating arrangements. The record attendance for the stadium was on 26 May 1980, when Bryne defeated Viking, and 13,621 paying spectators were in attendance. However, an earlier game between the two rivals on 9 October 1977 was estimated to have been witnessed by as many as 14,500 individuals. Although the club considers 13,621 to be the official record, as the earlier fixture had only 12,236 paying spectators.

In recent years, Bryne has been exploring the possibility of redeveloping their home ground or constructing a new stadium elsewhere to increase revenue and comply with the Norwegian Football Association&#x27;s regulations for hosting top-tier football matches. On 14 February 2006, the club unveiled plans for the Jæren Arena, an 8,688-capacity stadium designed by the same architects who created Viking Stadion. The project was estimated to cost 150 million NOK, and on 12 December 2006, the club announced that it had secured financing for the stadium.

Initially, the stadium was planned to be located on the border between Time and Klepp. However, obtaining a construction permit for the site proved difficult due to its agricultural zoning, and the club eventually settled for a new location approximately 900 meters south of the current stadium. Bryne intended to have the stadium completed in time for the 2008 season, but unfortunately, the project hit a snag in 2010 when developer Jæren Arena AS went bankrupt, and the plans were abandoned. As a result, Bryne is currently planning to redevelop their current stadium.

<doc id="203929" wikidata="Q2438391" url="?curid=203929" title="Chuck E. Cheese">
<text>Chuck E. Cheese (formerly known as Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s Pizza Time Theatre, Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s Pizza, and simply Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s) is an American entertainment restaurant chain founded in May 1977. Headquartered in Irving, Texas, each location features arcade games, amusement rides and musical shows in addition to serving pizza and other food items; former mainstays included ball pits, crawl tubes, and animatronic shows. The chain&#x27;s name is taken from its main character and mascot, Chuck E. Cheese. The first location opened as Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s Pizza Time Theatre in San Jose, California on May 17, 1977. It was the first family restaurant to integrate food with arcade games and animated entertainment, thus being one of the pioneers for the &quot;family entertainment center&quot; concept.

After filing for bankruptcy in 1984, the chain was acquired in 1985 by Brock Hotel Corporation, the parent company of competitor ShowBiz Pizza Place. The merger formed a new parent company, ShowBiz Pizza Time, Inc., which began unifying the two brands in 1990, renaming every location Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s Pizza. It was later shortened to Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s in 1994 and Chuck E. Cheese in 2019. The parent company, ShowBiz Pizza Time also became CEC Entertainment in 1998.

==History==
===Pizza Time Theatre===
Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s Pizza Time Theatre was founded by Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, who sought to expand video-game arcades beyond adult locations like pool halls to family-friendly venues. His experience in the amusement park industry, and his fondness for the Enchanted Tiki Roomand the Country Bear Jamboree at Disneyland, influenced his concept for Pizza Time Theatre. He has said, &quot;It was my pet project ... I chose pizza because of the wait time and the build schedule—very few components, and not too many ways to screw it up.&quot; 

Prior to founding Atari, Bushnell would drive around the Bay Area with Atari co-founder Ted Dabney looking at different pizza parlors and restaurants to brainstorm concepts. &quot;Chuck E. Cheese was always his (Nolan&#x27;s) passion project, even before Atari was a thing,&quot; said Dabney. &quot;He wanted to start a business of family-friendly restaurants with amusement park midway games. I think initially it made no fiscal sense, so he shelved it for a while, but then when Atari took off, he had the means to pursue it, plus a built-in distribution model for Atari&#x27;s new releases.&quot;

When his first animatronic show was being assembled, Bushnell learned the costume he had bought for his main character, a coyote, was actually a rat, prompting him to suggest changing the name from &quot;Coyote Pizza&quot; to &quot;Rick Rat&#x27;s Pizza&quot;. His marketing team believed this name would not be appealing to customers and proposed &quot;Chuck E. Cheese&quot; instead. The company adopted the rat as their mascot.

The first Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s Pizza Time Theatre opened in San Jose, California, in 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;mercurynews/chuck-e-cheese-history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, when Atari&#x27;s then-corporate parent, Warner Communications refused to open additional locations, Bushnell purchased the rights to the concept and characters from Warner for $500,000. Gene Landrum then resigned from Atari and was made the restaurants&#x27; president and chief operating officer. By the end of December 1979, there were seven PTT locations, six in California and one in Nevada (Sparks). Its &quot;Cyberamics&quot; animatronics were produced fully in-house by PTT employees.

===ShowBiz Pizza Place===

To expand beyond California and the west coast, Bushnell began to franchise, resulting in a co-development agreement between himself and Robert Brock of Topeka Inn Management in June 1979. The agreement handed Brock exclusive franchising rights for opening Pizza Time Theatres in sixteen states across the Southern and Midwestern United States, while also forming a company subdivision, &quot;Pizza Show Biz&quot;, to develop the Pizza Time Theatres.

Late in 1979, Brock became aware of Aaron Fechter of Creative Engineering, Inc. and his work in animatronics. In November 1979, he scouted Fechter&#x27;s business and concluded that Creative Engineering&#x27;s animatronics would be too strong a competition for Bushnell&#x27;s work. Brock therefore requested that Bushnell release him from their co-development agreement, wishing to develop with Fechter instead. 

In December 1979 Brock and Fechter formed ShowBiz Pizza Place Inc., and Brock gave notice to sever his development relationship with Bushnell. ShowBiz Pizza Place was conceptually identical to Pizza Time Theatre in all aspects except for animation, which would be provided by Creative Engineering. ShowBiz Pizza Place opened its first location on March 3, 1980, in Kansas City, Missouri.

Upon the opening of ShowBiz Pizza Place, Bushnell sued Brock and Topeka Inn Management over a breach of contract. Brock immediately issued a counter-suit against Bushnell, citing misrepresentation. The court case began in March 1980, and the courts ruled in favor of Bushnell after he successfully argued that ShowBiz was imitating his unique concepts. The ruling forced Brock to pay Bushnell a percentage of annual revenues from the first 160 locations he opened. Topeka Inn Management later changed its name to Brock Hotel Corporation, and in 1982 moved its headquarters to Irving, Texas. Both restaurants experienced increased success as the video game industry became more robust. To maintain competition, both franchises continually modified and diversified their animatronic shows.

===Decline, bankruptcy, and merger===
Pizza Time Theatre went public in 1981. Unlike ShowBiz, Pizza Time focused less on food quality, which was being offered at premium prices. The company placed more attention on the video game aspect of the business, but the popularity of arcades was beginning to decline in the United States. As a result, Chuck E. Cheese revenues began to fall by the end of 1982. The video game market crashed in 1983, and by the middle of the year, Pizza Time was operating in the red. Bushnell&#x27;s debts became insurmountable, and Pizza Time Theatre Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on March 28, 1984, reporting a loss of $58 million incurred in 1983.

The floundering company was then purchased by Brock in May 1985, merging the two restaurant companies into ShowBiz Pizza Time Inc. Both restaurant chains continued to operate under their respective titles, while major financial restructuring had begun.

In January 1989, ShowBiz Pizza Time became a public company, trading on Nasdaq with the ticker symbol SHBZ. Beginning in June 1990, ShowBiz restaurants began converting their stage shows and rebranding their storefronts to Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s Pizza. By September 1990, Creative Engineering officially cut ties with SPT. By 1994, all ShowBiz restaurants had rebranded into Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s restaurants. The name was then shortened to Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s by March 1994 after a redesigned concept. 

During the mid-1990s, the character Chuck E. Cheese began to see significant design changes. His vest (or tuxedo suit) and derby hat were changed for a baseball cap, casual shirt, and optional sneakers in an attempt to appeal to a younger audience.

In 1998, ShowBiz Pizza Time renamed itself CEC Entertainment, Inc. to reflect the remaining chain brand, alongside moving their stock to the NYSE with the ticker symbol CEC. CEC Entertainment has since acquired additional family restaurant properties, including 13 locations of the now-defunct Discovery Zone in 1999, and all locations of Peter Piper Pizza in October 2014. Peter Piper Pizza still operates under that name.

===International expansion===
In 1981, the restaurant opened its first international franchise in Australia under the name Charlie Cheese&#x27;s Pizza Playhouse. The name change had to do with the common meaning of the word &quot;chuck,&quot; which in Australia is a reference to the phrase &quot;to throw up.&quot;. The first location, located in Surfer&#x27;s Paradise, Queensland, relocated in 1982 to a location in Carina, Queensland. In January 2024, it was announced that Chuck E. Cheese would be making its return to Australia with a multi-unit franchise partnership with Royale Hospitality Group. Consecutively, Pizza Time Theatre, Inc. also opened at least one restaurant in Hong Kong and Singapore, which both closed shortly thereafter as a result of the initial company&#x27;s 1984 bankruptcy. Two locations in Puerto Rico franchised by Santa Rosa Enterprises would open in 1983: one in San Juan, Condado in September of that year, and one in the Santa Rosa Mall in Bayamón which would open in either November or December of that year. Both stores would be short-lived and would approximately close by the end of 1985. Pizza Time Theatre also opened a location in Creteil, France in 1984 and planned to open a location in Ealing, England in the mid &#x27;80s, but the plan failed. In December 2024, it was announced that Chuck E. Cheese would be making its official debut in the United Kingdom with target cities including Glasgow, Scotland, Manchester, England, and Bristol, England.

In 1994, nine years after ShowBiz Pizza Time was formed, the first new international location would open in Lo Barnechea, Santiago, Chile. More restaurants would open in the country, with 13 total stores as of 2023. In the late 90&#x27;s, there was a plan to expand to Israel, 1998 saw the plan of expanding to Japan first opening in Tokyo. These never materialized. An expansion for the Philippines was planned, and the first location would have opened by 2000. However, these plans (like Pizza Time Theatre&#x27;s plans for future expansion) never materialized. In the Middle East, locations would open in Saudi Arabia beginning in 2001, the United Arab Emirates in 2008, Jordan in 2019, Bahrain in 2021, Qatar in 2022, and Kuwait in 2024. Three new locations would open in Puerto Rico between 2003 and 2008. Another plan to open in the Glorietta mall complex of Makati City, Philippines, was greenlit in January 2013 but that also never happened.

On March 6, 2012, the first Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s in Mexico would officially open in Monterrey. &quot;Ratón Chito,&quot; an unofficial character, previously represented Chuck E. in the country during the 1980&#x27;s. This unique incarnation appeared throughout the ShowBiz (and later, Boomis) Pizza Fiesta chain of establishments, conceived as a result of closing Pizza Time Theatres in the United States. Assets from several store closures were shipped to the Mexican franchisees, with the intention of retrofitting the Pizza Time Players to better suit the country&#x27;s market demographic. Sally Industries of Jacksonville provided the controller equipment for these retrofits, as the animatronics arrived without their original control systems required for operation. The Ratón Chito aspect of ShowBiz Pizza Fiesta was later spun off into Boomis, separating itself from the rest of the company. These stores managed to successfully remain in operation until the 2000s, with one in Aguascalientes auctioning off equipment (including the retrofitted Chuck E. Cheese animatronics) as late as October 2018. 

In August 2022, it was announced that the first Chuck E. Cheese in Egypt would open in Sheik Zayed&#x27;s Royal Mall, with the location opening in February 2024.

In February 2023, a third Chuck E. Cheese location opened in Port of Spain, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, after the Chaguanas location in 2014, and the San Fernando location in 2016, although the San Fernando location closed sometime in January 2023.

At the time of the Port of Spain, Trinidad &amp; Tobago opening, Chuck E. Cheese had planned additional international locations to open in Jamaica in late 2023, Guyana in 2024, and another in Jamaica by 2025. 

In December 2024, CEC Entertainment announced the first Chuck E. Cheese in Guyana would open in a multi-unit franchise agreement.

As of October 2024, CEC Entertainment owns and operates approximately 465 Chuck E. Cheese locations in the United States and Canada, with 96 franchised locations in the US, Puerto Rico, and 16 countries around the world, as well as 96 Peter Piper Pizza restaurants in the US, and 13 in Mexico. The company also owns and operates Fun Spot Arcade, a chain of mall arcades that has 2 locations in the United States. In February 2025, Fun Spot Arcade would be rebranded to “Chuck’s Arcade” to give reference to Chuck E., and to acknowledge the brands history, the first such location opening at the Mall of Georgia in Buford, Georgia, with a second location opening at the Pheasant Lane Mall in Nashua, New Hampshire. The company&#x27;s locations are located in 45 states domestically and in 16 foreign countries and territories around the world. As of 2024, franchising is only available for markets outside of the United States.

===Buyout and modern redesign===
By 2012, CEC was struggling with decreasing revenue. They ran a rebranding campaign, changing the Chuck E. Cheese mascot into a slimmer rock star mouse who plays electric guitar. Voice actor Duncan Brannan, who for 18 years had characterized Chuck E. as a hip and young mouse, was replaced with Jaret Reddick, the frontman and guitarist for the pop punk band Bowling for Soup.

In February 2014, Apollo Global Management acquired CEC Entertainment, Inc. for $54 per share, or about $950 million. In October 2014, under Apollo Global Management, CEC Entertainment announced that they would purchase their Phoenix-based competitor, Peter Piper Pizza from ACON Investments.

In August 2017, the company began to pilot a new design concept at seven remodelled locations (three in Kansas City, three in San Antonio, one in Selma, Texas), branded as Chuck E. Cheese Pizzeria &amp; Games (also known as the Chuck E. Cheese 2.0 remodel by fans). These locations feature more upscale decor with a &quot;muted&quot; interior color scheme, an open kitchen, the &quot;Play Pass&quot; card system to replace arcade tokens, and the animatronic stage show replaced by a dance floor area. These changes, along with expansions to food offerings, were intended to help the chain be more appealing to adults and encourage family dining as opposed to primarily hosting parties.

In 2019, the corporation announced it would go public on the New York Stock Exchange through a shell company, Leo Holdings Corporation, of which Apollo will still own 51%. &quot;Bloomberg&quot; also reported that after going public, Chuck E. Cheese would no longer have animatronics as part of the entertainment. The proposed merger between CEC Entertainment and Leo Holdings Corporation was terminated on July 29, 2019.

In April 2023, the company began testing a small trampoline zone for children at the Brooklyn, New York location. As of 2024 it is installed in most of the company-owned United States and Canada locations.

In June 2024, the company began testing a small obstacle course called the “Ninja Run” at the Grand Prairie, Texas location. Beginning in 2025 it will be installed in more locations in the US.

In August 2024, the company announced a national tiered membership program.

===Financial trouble and second buyout===
The COVID-19 pandemic had been financially damaging to the parent company during 2020, and with an estimated $1–2 billion in debt, the possibility exists of all CEC properties being forced to close if bankruptcy refinancing fails. CEC Entertainment solicited $200 million in loans to finance a restructuring under bankruptcy protection. CEC Entertainment and its subsidiaries also filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas on June 25, 2020. In December 2020, CEC Entertainment, Inc, the owners of Chuck E. Cheese and Peter Piper Pizza chains, emerged from its June bankruptcy under the ownership and selling of its lenders led by Monarch Alternative Capital, reorganized under CEC Entertainment Holdings, LLC. On January 16, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court closed 15 of 16 of the affiliate debtor&#x27;s cases, while future matters of each debtor would be administered and heard in CEC Entertainment Holdings, LLC Chapter 11 case.
==Entertainment==

=== Films and series ===
In 1983, Pizza Time Theatre would create a Christmas TV special, titled &quot;The Christmas That Almost Wasn&#x27;t&quot;, produced by animation company Kadabrascope, a Pizza Time Theatre subsidiary. The special centers around Chuck E. Cheese and Jasper T. Jowls as they travel to the North Pole to save Christmas.

In 1999, Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s would release a direct-to-video film, titled &quot;Chuck E. Cheese in the Galaxy 5000&quot;, produced by FUNimation Entertainment. The movie follows Chuck E. Cheese and his friends as they travel to a distant planet to win money to fix Charlie Rockit&#x27;s aunt and uncle&#x27;s tractor engine.

In September 2020, CEO David McKillips would say that the company had recently launched an entertainment division, the goal being to produce movies and TV shows featuring the CEC cast of characters.

In January 2024, CEC Entertainment would announce a game show, being developed by Magical Elves. The series will feature adults competing with larger versions of classic Chuck E. Cheese arcade games, such as pinball, air hockey, and Skee-Ball.

===Video arcade===

Since the company&#x27;s inception, one of the primary draws for the business has been its video arcade offering inside restaurants. Within the arcade, customers can play card-operated video games or redemption games, the latter of which involves games of skill that reward players in the form of tickets based on score. Tickets can be redeemed later for merchandise, such as candy and toys. In late 2020, paper tickets were retired and replaced with electronic tickets, which are stored on the Play Pass cards.

The coin-op games originally accepted brass tokens issued by the company, stamped with various logos and branding that evolved over time. The company experimented with a card access method as a replacement for tokens in the late 2000s, which allowed customers to load credits onto a card that could then be swiped for access at arcade games and refilled later. It was tested under different names, including &quot;Chuck E.&#x27;s Super Discount Card&quot; and &quot;Chuck E. Token Card.&quot;. In late 2016, a new card system known as &quot;Chuck E.&#x27;s Play Pass&quot; was introduced to replace tokens throughout the chain, utilizing a similar method of gameplay as the Token Card.

In September 2024, the company launched a chain of mall arcades called Fun Spot Arcade at the Trumbull Mall in Trumbull, Connecticut. The arcade lacks Chuck E. Cheese branding, although it uses the Play Pass card system and electronic tickets like the Chuck E. Cheese restaurants. In February 2025, Fun Spot Arcade would rebrand to &quot;Chuck&#x27;s Arcade&quot; to acknowledge the company&#x27;s history and utilize the Chuck E. Cheese character.

===Animatronics===
Another primary draw for the centers since their beginning through the mid-2010s has been their animatronic shows. There have historically been several different styles of animatronic shows in use within the company, details of which would vary depending on when the location opened, whether it was renovated, available room for animatronic stages, and other factors. Over the years, these animatronics have often been supplemented by (and in recent years been completely &quot;replaced&quot; by) costumed characters.

When the first location opened in 1977, the animatronic characters were featured as busts in framed portraits hanging on the walls of the main dining area. The original show featured Crusty the Cat (the first character to face retirement as he was soon replaced with Mr. Munch in 1978), Pasqually the Singing Chef, Jasper T. Jowls, the Warblettes, and the main focus of the show, Chuck E. Cheese. By 1979, many restaurants had also added &quot;cabaret&quot; shows in separate rooms of each restaurant. One of the early Cabaret characters was Dolli Dimples, a hippopotamus who played the piano and sang in the blues/jazz style of performer Pearl Bailey. The in-house control system, which consisted of a 6502-based controller in a card cage with various driver boards, was called &quot;Cyberamics&quot;.

While Fechter separately produced the Rock-afire Explosion animatronics for ShowBiz Pizza through the early 1980s, Bushnell and Pizza Time Theatre continued work on characters for their portrait format and newer Balcony Stage shows under the umbrella of the Pizza Time Players. Development on Cabaret concepts slowed greatly after Pizza Time Theatre Inc.&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1984 and its purchase by ShowBiz a year later. From 1985 to 1990, the merged company kept their brands (and their respective animatronic shows) mostly separate.
After Fechter refused to sign over the rights to the Rock-afire Explosion to Showbiz Pizza Time, Inc., &quot;Concept Unification&quot; was undertaken beginning between 1989 and 1990 and continuing through 1993 to eliminate Fechter&#x27;s characters from ShowBiz locations and replace them with that of the Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s characters. The animatronics built by Creative Engineering for their Rock-afire Explosion band were retrofitted as &quot;Munch&#x27;s Make Believe Band&quot;, with new costumes and cosmetics. The exact year of when Concept Unification started is debated by fans. At first, the existing Pizza Time Theatre Cyberamics did not coincide with the character update, but they were later reconfigured and costumed to reflect the updated Munch&#x27;s Make Believe Band character designs.

In November 1990, ShowBiz Pizza Time debuted a new stage show for future CEC locations called the &quot;Road Stage&quot;, being the first Cyberamic stage to use the Munch&#x27;s Make Believe Band format to coincide with Concept Unification. The Road Stage featured a full-bodied Chuck E. Cheese Cyberamic standing on a platform, while the rest of the half-bodied band characters were set on buildings. The first location to install this stage opened in Jonesboro, Georgia in November 1990, and the last Road Stage location opened in June 1992 in Sun Valley, California. In February 1992, the Cyberamic 2-Stage debuted at the White Settlement, Texas location, featuring Chuck E. and the band on two separate stages. The last location to install a 2-Stage was in Florence, Kentucky between 2002 and 2003. In March 1992, the 1-Stage debuted at the Waldorf, Maryland location, featuring all characters together on one stage. The last location to install a 1-Stage was in Citrus Heights, California, between 2014 and 2015.

In August 1996, a test stage at the Valley View Mall/Montfort Drive location in Dallas, Texas, was created—the first attempt at a single-character animatronic stage, The Awesome Adventure Machine. This animatronic show consisted of neon flashy lights and items around the show. This stage took over what is commonly referred to as a &quot;3-Stage&quot; (an animatronic show converted from a former Rock-afire Explosion show from Showbiz Pizza Place). This animatronic show was never installed in any other location and was removed by late 1997 or early 1998 and replaced by Studio C.
Beginning in December 1997 with the Brookfield, Wisconsin location, a new animatronic show began being installed in new stores, referred to as &quot;Studio C&quot;, consisting of a single 32-movement Chuck E. Cheese animatronic character created by Garner Holt alongside large television monitors, lighting effects, and interactive elements. Studio C eventually served as the replacement for Munch&#x27;s Make Believe Band stages, with the last MMBB location opening in Mentor, Ohio in July 1998. Following the discontinuation of MMBB shows, the Studio C series of stages continued to evolve, starting with the Small-Town Studio C 2000 in early 2000, the &quot;Studio C 2000&quot; in late 2000, and the Small-Town Studio C 2003 in July 2003. The last new Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s location to receive a new Studio C 2000 stage opened in Concepción, Chile in August 2012, and the last existing Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s location to receive a Studio C 2000 was in Cincinnati, Ohio around 2014.

In late 2009, a new single-character stage was conceptualized by Westerville, Ohio-based brand agency Chute Gerdeman for Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s, and this idea became the &quot;Star Stage&quot;. The Star Stage debuted in April 2010 as a test stage at the new Valley View Mall/Montfort Drive location in Dallas, Texas, replacing their Studio C 2000 stage. The Montfort Drive location&#x27;s Star Stage reused the 32-movement Chuck E. Cheese animatronic, and the scenery included 2 side vertical video walls, curtains for the main stage, a cut out background, and 2 lowering recording studio and sports stadium backdrops. Chuck E.&#x27;s stage and the &quot;APPLAUSE&quot; and &quot;ON THE AIR&quot; signs were recycled from Montfort Drive&#x27;s Studio C 2000 stage. The stage curtains would be removed by late April 2010 and side video walls would be replaced with flatscreen TVs in early 2012. Former CEC entertainment director Jeremy Blaido ordered for the show be removed in 2012 due to internal controversy with new entertainment director Robert Gotcher at the time, leading to Gotcher being fired that year. The Star Stage at the Dallas, Texas Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s location ended up being removed in August 2012 after over 2 years in operation.

In September 2010, a new stage titled the &quot;Chuck E.&#x27;s Make Believe Band&quot; stage (also known as Concept Unification 1-Stage by fans) was tested at the Whitehall, Pennsylvania location. It reused the Concept Unification animatronics from the 3-Stage and put them all together on a single stage with new backdrops. On this show, Munch&#x27;s Make Believe Band would be renamed to Chuck E.&#x27;s Make Believe Band, likely as an attempt to make Chuck E. Cheese more of the star. 2 more CU 1-Stage shows would be installed at the Springfield, Illinois and Columbus, Georgia locations in 2011 before it was retired. The Chuck E.&#x27;s Make Believe Band stage is Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s latest stage featuring the full band to date.

On April 26, 2011, a new test stage titled the &quot;Galaxy Stage&quot; debuted at the new Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s location in West Melbourne, Florida. The Galaxy Stage was themed around a futuristic city, and was the first stage not to use the Studio C name. It did not expand beyond its test location, and was removed in April 2023 during the West Melbourne location&#x27;s 2.0 remodel renovations.

Following the removal the Dallas, Texas (Montfort Drive) location&#x27;s Star Stage in August 2012, a new stage premiered at that location, referred to as &quot;Circles of Light&quot;, utilizing the animatronic Chuck E. Cheese produced by Garner Holt for the previous Studio C series of stages. The stages were manufactured by Corman &amp; Associates and the control system for the new stage type was produced by Weigl Controls, developing a custom version of their ProCommander series of controllers for CEC.

In July 2020, the Darien, Illinois location replaced their 3-Stage animatronics and props with the Studio C 2000 backdrops and 16-movement animatronic from the Joliet, Illinois location which had remodeled in early 2020. Another installation of this unique stage would be installed in November 2020 at the Chicago, Illinois location on Kedzie Avenue. The Darien location would remove their stage during their remodel in June 2023, and the Chicago (Kedzie) location would remodel and remove their stage in August 2024.

For stores still featuring animatronics, updated programs for Munch’s Make Believe Band stages were generally distributed on DVD between 2007 and 2022. Studio ‘C’ stores ran off of 3 DVDs and a floppy disk from 1999 to 2022, previously having used LaserDisc. Weigl (Circles of Light stages and Dance Floors) stores use a USB and a MicroSD card.

In mid-2022, a new system for running the animatronic shows (3-Stage, Cyberamics, and all Studio ‘C’ and Weigl shows) was introduced that would, instead of using physical media such as DVDs, function using the store&#x27;s Wi-Fi connection. The implementation of said device caused a problem for the Studio C shows, as their previous show system(s) had special file formats for programming signals; therefore the switch to the new system would cause no animatronic movements to happen, except for a &quot;Random Movements&quot; program. The Munch&#x27;s Make Believe Band stages (CEI and Cyberamics shows) were not affected by this change of systems, although programming of new songs would cease in 2023 due to budget cuts.

====Elimination of animatronics====
In 2002, Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s opened three locations, two in Waco and Lake Jackson, Texas, and one in Dover, Delaware, experimenting with a new type of format featuring a smaller layout, a buffet, no play structures, no animatronic stage (albeit featuring a &quot;blue screen&quot; from the Studio &#x27;C&#x27; stages), and a constant presence of the Chuck E. Cheese costumed character. All three &quot;Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s Buffet&quot; locations would remodel to standard Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s and receive &quot;Small-Town Studio &#x27;C&#x27;&quot; stages with an animatronic between 2003 and 2006.

In September 2012, The &quot;Circles of Light&quot; stage at the Montfort Drive location in Dallas, Texas removed their animatronic, initially using the stage platform for costumed character performances. Beginning in early 2013, Circles of Light stages began being installed in newly opened stores without an animatronic, although a few Circles of Light stores would open with an animatronic from 2012 to 2018. In 2014, the Montfort Drive location would test a prototype of the &quot;Chuck E. Live Stage&quot; in their gameroom.

In August 2013, the newly opened Montgomery, Alabama location was the first Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s in 11 years to open without any animatronics, as it opened with a Circles of Light stage with no Chuck E. animatronic. Circles of Light would also replace 4 older animatronic stages in CEC locations between March 2014 and September 2017. The first being a 3-Stage in San Antonio, Texas in March 2014, a 1-Stage in Rohnert Park, California between late 2014 and early 2015, another 3-Stage in Matteson, Illinois in February 2015, and another 3-Stage in Wilmington, Delaware in September 2017. The last existing Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s location to receive a COL stage was in San Jose, California in December 2018, while the last new location to receive a COL stage was in Port of Spain, Trinidad &amp; Tobago in February 2023.

By May 2015, the &quot;Chuck E. Live Stage,&quot; also known as &quot;Stage V2&quot; or commonly referred to as the &quot;Dance Floor,&quot; which featured no animatronics at all, a modernized dance floor, and performances only with costumed characters, had been created. In 2017, the chain announced that animatronic shows would be removed entirely in favor of this design in seven pilot locations. After the pilot locations showed promise, retirement of animatronics at Chuck E. Cheese locations accelerated and continued through 2019, by which time 80 of its stores were expected to be retrofitted to the new design.

However, in November 2023, the company announced one location in Northridge, California as the first &quot;legacy and new&quot; store location that would keep their animatronic stage, which is a 2-Stage Cyberamics show. The grand reopening for this store after the remodel was held on November 10 with Nolan Bushnell attending. They would go back on this stance in May 2024 with a &quot;New York Times&quot; article announcing a location in Nanuet, New York as the second &quot;legacy and new&quot; store. Nanuet has a Studio &#x27;C&#x27; 2000, 16M stage. The grand reopening was held on July 18.

In May 2024, the animatronic shows were reported to have been set to be phased out by the end of 2024, with all but two venues discontinuing their performances, the Northridge, California and Nanuet, New York locations. The decision aligned with Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s strategic transformation towards modernization since 2020, including the introduction of digital entertainment features such as screens, digital dance floors, and trampoline gym areas. After a negative response from the public, the company subsequently announced on May 24 that three additional locations would be keeping their animatronic stages: Charlotte, North Carolina, which has a 3-Stage; Hicksville, New York, which has a Cyberamics 1-Stage; and Springfield, Illinois, which has a CU 1-Stage. Hicksville held their grand reopening on July 19, Springfield held their grand reopening on July 25, and Charlotte held their grand reopening on July 26.

On February 9, 2025, the CEO of the company, David McKillips, confirmed that the location in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada on Dixie Road would be keeping their animatronic stage. Mississauga has a Road Stage.

As of February 2025, approximately 49 locations remain with the animatronic shows and that number is expected to decline over the next year.

== Food ==
Pizza is the main focus of the restaurant portion of the business, but the menu features other items as well including cold-cut sandwiches, chicken wings, salad bar access, and desserts. In addition, some Chuck E. Cheese locations offer alcoholic beverages.

In March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the restaurant began selling pizza, wings, desserts and more through food delivery services under the ghost kitchen Pasqually&#x27;s Pizza &amp; Wings. The Pasqually name comes from Pasqually P. Pieplate, who is a member of Munch&#x27;s Make Believe Band, the Chuck E Cheese animatronic band. While food sold under this brand comes from the same brick-and-mortar kitchens as Chuck E. Cheese, the company claims to use different ingredients and recipes that cater to a more mature audience. Practically all of the Chuck E. Cheese stores in the United States are selling and delivering food under this virtual brand.

In October 2024, the company announced a partnership with Thrifty Ice Cream for a birthday cake ice cream flavor inspired by Chuck E. Cheese, to be sold at 34 Chuck E. Cheese fun centers and 350 Rite-Aid locations in Southern California.

== Subsidiaries ==
Incorporated subsidiaries of CEC Entertainment include Peter Piper Pizza, LLC, a similar family entertainment center chain based in Phoenix, Arizona which was acquired in October 2014; CEC Entertainment Concepts, L.P., which holds the company&#x27;s trademarks; and SPT Distribution Company, Inc., which serves as the distribution center for the company, including a parts department, technical support, and game refurbishing center, and is based in a warehouse at the Forbes Industrial Park in Topeka, Kansas In 2013, the warehouse lease would be extended due to the company&#x27;s long-time presence in Topeka dating back to 1980, as well to keep jobs in the city.

<text>The theory of constraints (TOC) is a management paradigm that views any manageable system as being limited in achieving more of its goals by a very small number of constraints. There is always at least one constraint, and TOC uses a focusing process to identify the constraint and restructure the rest of the organization around it. TOC adopts the common idiom &quot;a chain is no stronger than its weakest link&quot;. That means that organizations and processes are vulnerable because the weakest person or part can always damage or break them, or at least adversely affect the outcome.

== History ==
The theory of constraints is an overall management philosophy, introduced by Eliyahu M. Goldratt in his 1984 book titled &quot;The Goal&quot;, that is geared to help organizations continually achieve their goals. Goldratt adapted the concept to project management with his book &quot;Critical Chain&quot;, published in 1997.

An earlier propagator of a similar concept was Wolfgang Mewes in Germany with publications on &quot;power-oriented management theory&quot; (Machtorientierte Führungstheorie, 1963) and following with his &quot;Energo-Kybernetic System (EKS, 1971)&quot;, later renamed &quot;Engpasskonzentrierte Strategie&quot; (Bottleneck-focused Strategy) as a more advanced &quot;theory of bottlenecks&quot;. The publications of Wolfgang Mewes are marketed through the FAZ Verlag, publishing house of the German newspaper &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;. However, the paradigm &quot;Theory of constraints&quot; was first used by Goldratt.

===Key assumption===
The underlying premise of the theory of constraints is that organizations can be measured and controlled by variations on three measures: throughput, operational expense, and inventory. Inventory is all the money that the system has invested in purchasing things which it intends to sell. Operational expense is all the money the system spends in order to turn inventory into throughput. Throughput is the rate at which the system generates money through sales.

Before the goal itself can be reached, necessary conditions must first be met. These typically include safety, quality, legal obligations, etc. For most businesses, the goal itself is to make profit. However, for many organizations and non-profit businesses, making money is a necessary condition for pursuing the goal. Whether it is the goal or a necessary condition, understanding how to make sound financial decisions based on throughput, inventory, and operating expense is a critical requirement.

===The five focusing steps===
TOC is based on the premise that the rate of goal achievement by a goal-oriented system (i.e., the system&#x27;s throughput) is limited by at least one constraint.

The argument by reductio ad absurdum is as follows: If there was nothing preventing a system from achieving higher throughput (i.e., more goal units in a unit of time), its throughput would be infinite – which is impossible in a real-life system.

Only by increasing flow through the constraint can overall throughput be increased.

Assuming the goal of a system has been articulated and its measurements defined, the steps are:

# &quot;Identify&quot; the system&#x27;s constraint(s).
# Decide how to &quot;exploit&quot; the system&#x27;s constraint(s).
# &quot;Subordinate&quot; everything else to the above decision.
# &quot;Elevate&quot; the system&#x27;s constraint(s).
# &quot;Warning!&quot; If in the previous steps a constraint has been broken, go back to step 1, but do not allow inertia to cause a system&#x27;s constraint.

The goal of a commercial organization is: &quot;Make more money now and in the future&quot;, and its measurements are given by throughput accounting as: throughput, inventory, and operating expenses.

The five focusing steps aim to ensure ongoing improvement efforts are centered on the organization&#x27;s constraint(s). In the TOC literature, this is referred to as the &quot;process of ongoing improvement&quot; (POOGI).

These focusing steps are the key steps to developing the specific applications mentioned below.

===Constraints===
A constraint is anything that prevents the system from achieving its goal. There are many ways that constraints can show up, but a core principle within TOC is that there are not tens or hundreds of constraints. There is at least one, but at most only a few in any given system. Constraints can be internal or external to the system. An internal constraint is in evidence when the market demands more from the system than it can deliver. If this is the case, then the focus of the organization should be on discovering that constraint and following the five focusing steps to open it up (and potentially remove it). An external constraint exists when the system can produce more than the market will bear. If this is the case, then the organization should focus on mechanisms to create more demand for its products or services.

Types of (internal) constraints
* Equipment: The way equipment is currently used limits the ability of the system to produce more salable goods/services.
* People: Lack of skilled people limits the system. Mental models held by people can cause behaviour that becomes a constraint.
* Policy: A written or unwritten policy prevents the system from making more.

The concept of the constraint in Theory of Constraints is analogous to but differs from the constraint that shows up in mathematical optimization. In TOC, the constraint is used as a focusing mechanism for management of the system. In optimization, the constraint is written into the mathematical expressions to limit the scope of the solution (X can be no greater than 5).

Please note: organizations have many problems with equipment, people, policies, etc. (A breakdown is just that – a breakdown – and is not a constraint in the true sense of the TOC concept). The constraint is the limiting factor that is preventing the organization from getting more throughput (typically, revenue through sales) even when nothing goes wrong.

===Breaking a constraint===
If a constraint&#x27;s throughput capacity is elevated to the point where it is no longer the system&#x27;s limiting factor, this is said to &quot;break&quot; the constraint. The limiting factor is now some other part of the system, or may be external to the system (an external constraint). This is not to be confused with a breakdown.

===Buffers===
Buffers are used throughout the theory of constraints. They often result as part of the exploit and subordinate steps of the five focusing steps. Buffers are placed before the governing constraint, thus ensuring that the constraint is never starved. Buffers are also placed behind the constraint to prevent downstream failure from blocking the constraint&#x27;s output. Buffers used in this way protect the constraint from variations in the rest of the system and should allow for normal variation of processing time and the occasional upset (Murphy) before and behind the constraint.

Buffers can be a bank of physical objects before a work center, waiting to be processed by that work center. Buffers ultimately buy you time, as in the time before work reaches the constraint and are often verbalized as time buffers. There should always be enough (but not excessive) work in the time queue before the constraint and adequate offloading space behind the constraint.

Buffers are &quot;not&quot; the small queue of work that sits before every work center in a kanban system although it is similar if you regard the assembly line as the governing constraint. A prerequisite in the theory is that with one constraint in the system, all other parts of the system must have sufficient capacity to keep up with the work at the constraint and to catch up if time was lost. In a balanced line, as espoused by kanban, when one work center goes down for a period longer than the buffer allows, then the entire system must wait until that work center is restored. In a TOC system, the only situation where work is in danger is if the constraint is unable to process (either due to malfunction, sickness or a &quot;hole&quot; in the buffer – if something goes wrong that the time buffer can not protect).

Buffer management, therefore, represents a crucial attribute of the theory of constraints. There are many ways to apply buffers, but the most often used is a visual system of designating the buffer in three colors: green (okay), yellow (caution) and red (action required). Creating this kind of visibility enables the system as a whole to align and thus subordinate to the need of the constraint in a holistic manner. This can also be done daily in a central operations room that is accessible to everybody.

===Plant types===
There are four primary types of plants in the TOC lexicon. Draw the flow of material from the bottom of a page to the top, and you get the four types. They specify the general flow of materials through a system, and also provide some hints about where to look for typical problems. This type of analysis is known as VATI analysis as it uses the bottom-up shapes of the letters V, A, T, and I to describe the types of plants. The four types can be combined in many ways in larger facilities, e.g. &quot;an A plant feeding a V plant&quot;.
* V-plant: The general flow of material is one-to-many, such as a plant that takes one raw material and can make many final products. Classic examples are meat rendering plants or a steel manufacturer. The primary problem in V-plants is &quot;robbing,&quot; where one operation (A) immediately after a diverging point &quot;steals&quot; materials meant for the other operation (B). Once the material has been processed by A, it cannot come back and be run through B without significant rework.
* A-plant: The general flow of material is many-to-one, such as in a plant where many sub-assemblies converge for a final assembly. The primary problem in A-plants is in synchronizing the converging lines so that each supplies the final assembly point at the right time.
* T-plant: The general flow is that of an I-plant (or has multiple lines), which then splits into many assemblies (many-to-many). Most manufactured parts are used in multiple assemblies and nearly all assemblies use multiple parts. Customized devices, such as computers, are good examples. T-plants suffer from both synchronization problems of A-plants (parts aren&#x27;t all available for an assembly) and the robbing problems of V-plants (one assembly steals parts that could have been used in another).
* I-plant: Material flows in a sequence, such as in an assembly line. The primary work is done in a straight sequence of events (one-to-one). The constraint is the slowest operation.

From the above list, one can deduce that for non-material systems one could draw the flow of work or the flow of processes, instead of physical flows, and arrive at similar basic V, A, T, or I structures. A project, for example, is an A-shaped sequence of work, culminating in a delivered product (&quot;i.e., the intended outcome of the project&quot;).

==Applications==
The focusing steps, this process of ongoing improvement, have been applied to manufacturing, project management, supply chain/distribution generated specific solutions. Other tools (mainly the &quot;thinking process&quot;) also led to TOC applications in the fields of marketing and sales, and finance. The solution as applied to each of these areas are listed below.

===Operations===
Within manufacturing operations and operations management, the solution seeks to pull materials through the system, rather than push them into the system. The primary methodology used is drum-buffer-rope (DBR) and a variation called simplified drum-buffer-rope (S-DBR).

Drum-buffer-rope is a manufacturing execution methodology based on the fact the output of a system can only be the same as the output at the constraint of the system. Any attempt to produce more than what the constraint can process just leads to excess inventory piling up. The method is named for its three components. The &quot;drum&quot; is the rate at which the physical constraint of the plant can work: the work center or machine or operation that limits the ability of the entire system to produce more. The rest of the plant follows the beat of the drum. Schedule at the drum decides what the system should produce, in what sequence to produce and how much to produce. They make sure the drum has work and that anything the drum has processed does not get wasted.

The &quot;buffer&quot; protects the drum, so that it always has work flowing to it. Buffers in DBR provide the additional lead time beyond the required set up and process times, for materials in the product flow. Since these buffers have time as their unit of measure, rather than quantity of material, this makes the priority system operate strictly based on the time an order is expected to be at the drum. Each work order will have a remaining buffer status that can be calculated. Based on this buffer status, work orders can be color coded into Red, Yellow and Green. The red orders have the highest priority and must be worked on first, since they have penetrated most into their buffers followed by yellow and green. As time evolves, this buffer status might change and the color assigned to the particular work order change with it.

Traditional DBR usually calls for buffers at several points in the system: the constraint, synchronization points and at shipping. S-DBR has a buffer at shipping and manages the flow of work across the drum through a load planning mechanism.

The &quot;rope&quot; is the work release mechanism for the plant. Orders are released to the shop floor at one &quot;buffer time&quot; before they are due to be processed by the constraint. In other words, if the buffer is 5 days, the order is released 5 days before it is due at the constraint. Putting work into the system earlier than this buffer time is likely to generate too-high work-in-process and slow down the entire system.

===High-speed automated production lines===
Automated production lines achieve high throughput rates and output quantities by deploying automation solutions that are highly task-specific. Depending on their design and construction, these machines operate at different speeds and capacities and therefore have varying efficiency levels.

A prominent example is the use of automated production lines in the beverage industry. Filling systems usually have several machines executing parts of the complete bottling process, from filling primary containers to secondary packaging and palletisation.

To be able to maximize the throughput, the production line usually has a designed constraint. This constraint is typically the slowest and often the most expensive machine on the line. The overall throughput of the line is determined by this machine. All other machines can operate faster and are connected by conveyors.

The conveyors usually have the ability to buffer product. In the event of a stoppage at a machine other than the constraint, the conveyor can buffer the product enabling the constraint machine to keep on running.

A typical line setup is such that in normal operation the upstream conveyors from the constraint machine are always run full to prevent starvation at the constraint and the downstream conveyors are run empty to prevent a back up at the constraint. The overall aim is to prevent minor stoppages at the machines from impacting the constraint.

For this reason as the machines get further from the constraint, they have the ability to run faster than the previous machine and this creates a V curve.

===Supply chain and logistics===
In general, the solution for supply chains is to create flow of inventory so as to ensure greater availability and to eliminate es.

The TOC distribution solution is effective when used to address a single link in the supply chain and more so across the entire system, even if that system comprises many different companies. The purpose of the TOC distribution solution is to establish a competitive advantage based on extraordinary availability by reducing the damages caused when the flow of goods is interrupted by shortages and surpluses.

This approach uses several new rules to protect availability with less inventory than is conventionally required.

# Inventory is held at an aggregation point(s) as close as possible to the source. This approach ensures smoothed demand at the aggregation point, requiring proportionally less inventory. The distribution centers holding the aggregated stock are able to ship goods downstream to the next link in the supply chain much more quickly than a make-to-order manufacturer can.
# Following this rule may result in a make-to-order manufacturer converting to make-to-stock. The inventory added at the aggregation point is significantly less than the inventory reduction downstream.
# In all stocking locations, initial inventory buffers are set which effectively create an upper limit of the inventory at that location. The buffer size is equal to the maximum expected consumption within the average Replenishment Time (&quot;RT&quot;), plus additional stock to protect in case a delivery is late. In other words, there is no advantage in holding more inventory in a location than the amount that might be consumed before more could be ordered and received. Typically, the sum of the on hand value of such buffers are 25–75% less than currently observed average inventory levels
##Replenishment Time (RT) is the sum of the delay, after the first consumption following a delivery, before an order is placed plus the delay after the order is placed until the ordered goods arrive at the ordering location.
# Once buffers have been established, no replenishment orders are placed as long as the quantity inbound (already ordered but not yet received) plus the quantity on hand are equal to or greater than the buffer size. Following this rule causes surplus inventory to be bled off as it is consumed.
# For any reason, when on hand plus inbound inventory is less than the buffer, orders are placed as soon as practical to increase the inbound inventory so that the relationship on Hand + Inbound = Buffer is maintained.
# To ensure buffers remain correctly sized even with changes in the rates of demand and replenishment, a simple recursive algorithm called Buffer Management is used. When the on hand inventory level is in the upper third of the buffer for a full RT, the buffer is reduced by one third (and don&#x27;t forget rule 3). Alternatively, when the on hand inventory is in the bottom one third of the buffer for too long, the buffer is increased by one third (and don&#x27;t forget rule 4). The definition of &quot;too long&quot; may be changed depending on required service levels, however, a rule of thumb is 20% of the RT. Moving buffers up more readily than down is supported by the usually greater damage caused by shortages as compared to the damage caused by surpluses.

Once inventory is managed as described above, continuous efforts should be undertaken to reduce RT, late deliveries, supplier minimum order quantities (both per SKU and per order) and customer order batching. Any improvements in these areas will automatically improve both availability and inventory turns, thanks to the adaptive nature of Buffer Management.

A stocking location that manages inventory according to the TOC should help a non-TOC customer (downstream link in a supply chain, whether internal or external) manage their inventory according to the TOC process. This type of help can take the form of a vendor managed inventory (VMI). The TOC distribution link simply extends its buffer sizing and management techniques to its customers&#x27; inventories. Doing so has the effect of smoothing the demand from the customer and reducing order sizes per SKU. VMI results in better availability and inventory turns for both supplier and customer. The benefits to the non-TOC customers are sufficient to meet the purpose of capitalizing on the competitive edge by giving the customer a reason to be more loyal and give more business to the upstream link. When the end consumers buy more, the whole supply chain sells more.

One caveat should be considered. Initially and only temporarily, the supply chain or a specific link may sell less as the surplus inventory in the system is sold. However, the sales lift due to improved availability is a countervailing factor. The current levels of surpluses and shortages make each case different.

===Finance and accounting===
Holistic thinking applied to the finance application has been termed throughput accounting. Throughput accounting suggests that one examine the impact of investments and operational changes in terms of the impact on the throughput of the business. It is an alternative to cost accounting.

The primary measures for a TOC view of finance and accounting are: throughput, operating expense and investment. Throughput is calculated from sales minus &quot;totally variable cost&quot;, where totally variable cost is usually calculated as the cost of raw materials that go into creating the item sold.

===Project management===
Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) are utilized in this area. CCPM is based on the idea that all projects look like A-plants: all activities converge to a final deliverable. As such, to protect the project, there must be internal buffers to protect synchronization points and a final project buffer to protect the overall project.

===Marketing and sales===
While originally focused on manufacturing and logistics, TOC has expanded into sales management and marketing. Its role is explicitly acknowledged in the field of sales process engineering. For effective sales management one can apply Drum Buffer Rope to the sales process similar to the way it is applied to operations (see Reengineering the Sales Process book reference below). This technique is appropriate when your constraint is in the sales process itself, or if you just want an effective sales management technique which includes the topics of funnel management and conversion rates.

==Thinking processes==

The thinking processes are a set of tools to help managers walk through the steps of initiating and implementing a project. When used in a logical flow, they help walk through a process:
# Gain agreement on the problem
# Gain agreement on the direction for a solution
# Gain agreement that the solution solves the problem
# Agree to overcome any potential negative ramifications
# Agree to overcome any obstacles to implementation

TOC practitioners sometimes refer to these in the negative as working through &quot;layers of resistance&quot; to a change.

Recently, the &quot;current reality tree&quot; (CRT) and &quot;future reality tree&quot; (FRT) have been applied to an argumentative academic paper.

Despite its origins as a manufacturing approach (Goldratt &amp; Cox, The Goal: A process of Ongoing Improvement, 1992), Goldratt&#x27;s Theory of Constraints (TOC) methodology is now regarded as a systems methodology with strong foundations in the hard sciences (Mabin, 1999). Through its tools for convergent thinking and synthesis, the &quot;Thinking processes&quot;, which underpin the entire TOC methodology, help identify and manage constraints and guide continuous improvement and change in organizations (Dettmer H., 1998).

The process of change requires the identification and acceptance of core issues; the goal and the means to the goal. This comprehensive set of logical tools can be used for exploration, solution development and solution implementation for individuals, groups or organizations. Each tool has a purpose and nearly all tools can be used independently (Cox &amp; Spencer, 1998). Since these thinking tools are designed to address successive &quot;layers of resistance&quot; and enable communication, it expedites securing &quot;buy in&quot; of groups. While CRT (current reality tree) represents the undesirable effects of the current situation, the FRT (the future reality tree), NBR (negative branch) help people plan and understand the possible results of their actions. The PRT (prerequisite tree) and TRT (transition tree) are designed to build collective buy in and aid in the Implementation phase. The logical constructs of these tools or diagrams are the necessary condition logic, the sufficient cause logic and the strict logic rules that are used to validate cause-effect relationships which are modelled with these tools (Dettmer W., 2006).

A summary of these tools, the questions they help answer and the associated logical constructs used is presented in the table below.
TOC Thinking Process Tools:
Use of these tools are based on the fundamental beliefs of TOC that organizations a) are inherently simple (interdependencies exist in organizations) b) desire inherent harmony (win – win solutions are possible) c) are inherently good (people are good) and have inherent potential (people and organizations have potential to do better) (Goldratt E., 2009). In the book &quot;Through the clouds to solutions&quot; Jelena Fedurko (Fedurko, 2013) states that the major areas for application of TP tools as:
* To create and enhance thinking and learning skills
* To make better decisions
* To develop responsibility for one&#x27;s own actions through understanding their consequences
* To handle conflicts with more confidence and win-win outcomes
* To correct behavior with undesirable consequences
* Assist in evaluating conditions for achieving a desired outcome
* To assist in peer mediation
* To assist in relationship between subordinates and bosses

==Development and practice==
TOC was initiated by Goldratt, who until his death was still the main driving force behind the development and practice of TOC. There is a network of individuals and small companies loosely coupled as practitioners around the world. TOC is sometimes referred to as &quot;constraint management&quot;. TOC is a large body of knowledge with a strong guiding philosophy of growth.

==Criticism==
Criticisms that have been leveled against TOC include:

===Claimed suboptimality of drum-buffer-rope===
While TOC has been compared favorably to linear programming techniques, D. Trietsch from University of Auckland argues that DBR methodology is inferior to competing methodologies. Linhares, from the Getulio Vargas Foundation, has shown that the TOC approach to establishing an optimal product mix is unlikely to yield optimum results, as it would imply that P=NP.

===Unacknowledged debt===
Duncan (as cited by Steyn)
says that TOC borrows heavily from systems dynamics developed by Forrester in the 1950s and from statistical process control which dates back to World War II. And Noreen Smith and Mackey, in their independent report on TOC, point out that several key concepts in TOC &quot;have been topics in management accounting textbooks for decades.&quot; It is also claimed that Goldratt&#x27;s books fail to acknowledge that TOC borrows from more than 40 years of previous management science research and practice, particularly from program evaluation and review technique/critical path method (PERT/CPM) and the just in time strategy.

A rebuttal to these criticisms is offered in Goldratt&#x27;s &quot;What is the &quot;Theory of Constraints&quot; and How Should it be Implemented?&quot;, and in his audio program, &quot;Beyond The Goal&quot;. In these, Goldratt discusses the history of disciplinary sciences, compares the strengths and weaknesses of the various disciplines, and acknowledges the sources of information and inspiration for the thinking processes and critical chain methodologies. Articles published in the now-defunct Journal of &quot;Theory of Constraints&quot; referenced foundational materials. Goldratt published an article and gave talks with the title &quot;Standing on the Shoulders of Giants&quot; in which he gives credit for many of the core ideas of Theory of Constraints. Goldratt has sought many times to show the correlation between various improvement methods.

Goldratt has been criticized on lack of openness in his theories, an example being him not releasing the algorithm he used for the Optimum Performance Training system. Some view him as unscientific with many of his theories, tools and techniques not being a part of the public domain, rather a part of his own framework of profiting on his ideas.
According to Gupta and Snyder (2009), despite being recognized as a genuine management philosophy nowadays, TOC has yet failed to demonstrate its effectiveness in the academic literature and as such, cannot be considered academically worthy to be called a widely recognized theory. TOC needs more case studies that prove a connection between implementation and improved financial performance.
Nave (2002) argues that TOC does not take employees into account and fails to empower them in the production process. He also states that TOC fails to address unsuccessful policies as constraints.
In contrast, Mukherjee and Chatterjee (2007) state that much of the criticism of Goldratt&#x27;s work has been focused on the lack of rigour in his work, but not of the bottleneck approach, which are two different aspects of the issue.

==Certification and education==
The Theory of Constraints International Certification Organization (TOCICO) is an independent not-for-profit incorporated society that sets exams to ensure a consistent standard of competence. It is overseen by a board of academic and industrial experts. It also hosts an annual international conference. The work presented at these conferences constitutes a core repository of the current knowledge.

<doc id="203934" wikidata="Q1190247" url="?curid=203934" title="Fuso (company)">
<text>The is a Japanese manufacturer of trucks and buses. It is headquartered in Kawasaki, Kanagawa and owned by Germany-based Daimler Truck.

&quot;Fuso&quot; derives from the ancient Chinese term &quot;fusang&quot; (), for a sacred tree said to grow at the spot in the east where the sun rises, and has been used to refer to Japan itself. The actual fuso tree is a hibiscus.

==History==

=== Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. ===
In 1932, the first B46 bus (the &quot;Fuso&quot;) was built at the Mitsubishi Shipbuilding Company&#x27;s Kobe Works. Two years later (1934), the Mitsubishi Shipbuilding Company was renamed Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI). Three years after that (1937), the MHI motor-vehicle operations at the Kobe Works were transferred to the Tokyo Works. In 1949, the Fuso Motors Sales Company was established.

In 1950, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was split into three companies:

* West Japan Heavy Industries. 
* Central Japan Heavy Industries.
* East Japan Heavy Industries.

Two years later (1952):

* West Japan Heavy Industries was renamed to Mitsubishi Shipbuilding and Engineering Company.
* Central Japan Heavy Industries was renamed to Shin Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
* East Japan Heavy Industries was renamed to Mitsubishi Nippon Heavy Industries (MNHI). 
* Fuso Motor Sales Company was renamed to the Mitsubishi Fuso Motors Sales Company.

Products from the companies were distributed by Mitsubishi Fuso Motor Sales because of brand recognition.

=== Mitsubishi Fuso Heavy Industries. ===
In 1957, MNHI integrated the Tokyo and Kawasaki Works into the Tokyo Motor Vehicle Works. Seven years later (1964), these three companies merged to form Mitsubishi Fuso Heavy Industries;

=== Distribution ===
Mitsubishi Fuso Motors Sales split into two divisions: Shin and Fuso Motors Sales Company.

Sharing a logo, they split the distribution of heavy and light machinery; Shin distributed light machinery branded as Mitsubishi, and Fuso distributed heavy machinery branded as Fuso.

=== Mitsubishi Motor Company ===
In 1970, MFHI signed a joint-venture agreement with Chrysler Corporation, establishing the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation (MMC), and MFHI transferred its motor-vehicle operations to MMC.

In 1975, MMC opened the Nakatsu Plant at its Tokyo Motor Vehicle Works; five years later, it opened the Kitsuregawa Proving Grounds. Four years after that, MMC merged with Mitsubishi Motor Sales Company.

In 1985, MMC and Mitsubishi Corporation established the joint-equity company Mitsubishi Trucks of America in the United States. Eight years later, MMC and Chrysler dissolved their equity partnership. The following year, MMC and Mitsubishi joined to design, build, and distribute the Mitsubishi Lancer.

In 1999, MMC and Volvo joined their truck and bus operations, and Volvo acquired 5% of MMC. Two years later, DaimlerChrysler, formed after Chrysler had merged with Mercedes-Benz owners Daimler-Benz, replaced Volvo as MMC&#x27;s truck and bus partner and MMC renamed the Tokyo Plant the Truck and Bus Production Office (also known as the Kawasaki Plant).

===Daimler Truck===

In 2003, the Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation (MFTBC) was established. DaimlerChrysler, Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, and other Mitsubishi companies acquired 43, 42. and 15% shares, respectively, in MFTBC.

In 2005, Mitsubishi Motors Corporation transferred its MFTBC shares to DaimlerChrysler as part of their compensation agreement for financial damages resulting from quality problems and recalls at MFTBC. DaimlerChrysler and the Mitsubishi companies hold shares of 89 and 11%, respectively. In 2006, MFTBC moved its headquarters from Tokyo to Kawasaki-shi, Kanagawa; the following year, DaimlerChrysler sold its majority stake in Chrysler Corporation to Cerberus Capital Management. The corporation was renamed Daimler AG (now the Mercedes-Benz Group) and the DaimlerChrysler Truck Group was renamed Daimler Truck, with MFTBC part of the it.

On May 27, 2020, Mitsubishi Fuso Truck of America announced it is discontinuing new truck sales. The move is a result of a re-evaluation by Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corp. of its business situation in the United States and Canada, according to the announcement, as the company shifts to a service-focused operation in these markets.

In May 2023, Fuso and its parent Daimler Truck signed a memorandum of understanding with Hino and its parent Toyota for a plan of merging Hino and Fuso into a publicly traded holding company with &quot;equal investment&quot; from both Toyota and Daimler Truck.

==Facilities==
Fuso trucks are developed and built primarily at these Japanese facilities:
* Kitsuregawa Proving Ground
* Kawasaki Plant and Research and Development Center
* Nakatsu Plant, Aikawa, Kanagawa
* Mitsubishi Fuso Bus Manufacturing Company in Toyama, Toyama

Mitsubishi Fuso Canter work-trucks are manufactured in Indonesia, Egypt, Tramagal (Portugal), the Philippines, Venezuela, Turkey, and Russia. They are marketed in Japan, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and a number of other Asian countries, as well as in the United States.

Fuso trucks are also manufactured in India at the Daimler India Commercial Vehicles plant in Oragadam, near Chennai. Those vehicles are sold in East Africa and Southeast Asia. Mitsubishi Fuso&#x27;s European marketing and sales headquarters is in Stuttgart.

== Products ==


=== Van ===
* Canter Van (OEM Nissan Caravan, export only)

=== Trucks ===
* Canter aka FE/FF/FG/FH, formerly also rebadged and sold as the Sterling 360
* Canter Guts (Canter Mini FA/FB/FC/FD)
* Canter Eco Hybrid
* Fighter aka FH/FK/FM/FL
* The Great
* Super Great/Heavy Duty aka FP/FS/FV
* Fuso Shogun (manufactured in New Zealand)
* Fuso FJ (manufactured in India by BharatBenz for export)
* Fuso TV (manufactured in Malaysia and Thailand)
* Fuso FI

=== Buses and chassis ===
* Rosa
* Aero Midi MK/MJ/ME
* Aero Star MP
* Aero King
* Aero Ace/Bus/Queen MS
* Mitsubishi Cruiser
* Mitsubishi Eagle
* Fuso BK125L (Bus chassis)
* Fuso BM115/116/117/118 (Bus chassis)
* Fuso FE84G (Bus chassis)
* Fuso RK (Bus chassis)
* Fuso RM (Bus chassis)
* Fuso RP (Bus chassis)

==Electric transport==
The Mitsubishi Fuso Aero Star diesel-electric bus is being tested in Japan. According to the company, it can reduce fuel consumption by as much as 30%. The Aero Star uses a series hybrid drive, where its diesel engine drives an electric generator to recharge lithium-ion batteries connected to the two electric motors with a combined output of 158 kW, which propel the vehicle. Series hybrids are efficient on urban buses. Opposed to the buses the Mitsubishi Fuso Canter Eco Hybrid uses a parallel hybrid system with an electric Motor-generator on the transmission input shaft. This system maintains better efficiency gains at higher speeds.

==Global distribution==
Outside Japan, vehicles manufactured by the corporation are sold in:
* Latin America by Mitsubishi Motors, Daimler, and independent dealers (in Mexico, some Fuso vehicles are offered in Freightliner trademark, to replace the Sterling Trucks image that previously badged some trucks such as Canter and Super Great)
* Asia by Mitsubishi Motors, Mitsubishi Fuso Company, and Daimler independent dealers
* Middle East by Mitsubishi Motors and independent dealers
* Africa by Mitsubishi and independent dealers in Rwanda by Akagera Business Group
* Oceania by Daimler-Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi Motors, Fuso, and independent dealers
* Europe by Daimler Trucks and dealers

<text>Nano (symbol n) is a unit prefix meaning one billionth. Used primarily with the metric system, this prefix denotes a factor of 10−9 or . It is frequently encountered in science and electronics for prefixing units of time and length.

;Examples:
* Three gold atoms lined up are about one nanometer (nm) long.
* If a toy marble were scaled down to one nanometer wide, Earth would scale to about wide.
* One nanosecond (ns) is about the time required for light to travel 30 cm in air, or 20 cm in an optical fiber. 
* One nanometer per second (nm/s) is approximately the speed that a fingernail grows.

The prefix derives from the Greek (Latin ), meaning &quot;dwarf&quot;. The General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) officially endorsed the usage of &quot;nano&quot; as a standard prefix in 1960.

When used as a prefix for something other than a unit of measure (as for example in words like &quot;nanoscience&quot;), nano refers to nanotechnology, or means &quot;on a scale of nanometres&quot; (nanoscale).

== Nanometre ==
X-rays have a wavelength ranging from the size of 0.01 nm to 10 nm. 

Human fingernails grow at approximately one nanometer per second.

<text>Deca- (and dec-), sometimes deka-, is a common English-language numeral prefix derived from the Late Latin (&quot;(set of) ten&quot;), from Ancient Greek , from (déka, &quot;ten&quot;). It is used in many words.

It is also a decimal unit prefix in the International System of Units (SI) denoting a factor of ten, with symbol da and spelled &quot;deca&quot; internationally (or &quot;deka&quot; in American spelling).

==SI==
The prefix was a part of the original metric system in 1795. It is not in very common usage, although the decapascal is occasionally used by audiologists. The decanewton is also encountered occasionally, probably because it is an SI approximation of the kilogram-force. 
Its use is more common in Central Europe. In German, Polish, Czech, Slovak, and Hungarian, &quot;deka&quot; (or &quot;deko&quot;) is common, and used in self-standing form, always meaning &quot;decagram&quot;. 
A runway number typically indicates its magnetic azimuth in decadegrees.

Before the symbol as an SI prefix was standardized as &quot;da&quot; with the introduction of the International System of Units in 1960, various other symbols were more common, such as &quot;dk&quot; (e.g., UK and Austria), &quot;D&quot; (e.g., Germany, Eastern Europe), and &quot;Da&quot;. For syntactical reasons, the HP 48, 49, 50 series, as well as the HP 39gII and Prime calculators use the unit prefix &quot;D&quot;.

* 1 decametre = 10 metres
* 1 decalitre = 10 litres
* 1 decare = 10 ares

Examples:
* The blue whale is approximately 30 metres or 3 decametres in length.
==As an English prefix==
The prefix is used in many words.

===General===
* Decathlon, a combined event in athletics consisting of ten track and field events.
* Decennial, ten-yearly or a celebration of ten years.

===Mathematics===
* Decimal based on the number ten.
* Decagon a plane figure with ten sides
* Decahedron a polyhedron with ten faces

===Chemistry===
* Decane, a hydrocarbon with 10 carbon atoms

===Biology===
* Decapoda, an order of crustaceans with ten feet

===Religion===
* The Decalogue, the &quot;Ten Commandments&quot;

<text>Deci- (symbol d) is a decimal unit prefix in the metric system denoting a factor of one tenth. Proposed in 1793, and adopted in 1795, the prefix comes from the Latin , meaning &quot;tenth&quot;. Since 1960, the prefix is part of the International System of Units (SI).

A frequent use of the prefix is in the unit deciliter (dl), common in food recipes; many European homes have a deciliter measure for flour, water, etc. A common measure in engineering is the unit decibel for measuring ratios of power and root-power quantities, such as sound level and electrical amplification.

Example
*The diameter of a compact disc is about 12 centimetres or 1.2 decimetres.

<text>Hecto (symbol: h) is a decimal unit prefix in the metric system denoting a factor of one hundred. It was adopted as a multiplier in 1795, and comes from the Greek , meaning &quot;hundred&quot;. In 19th century English it was sometimes spelled &quot;hecato&quot;, in line with a puristic opinion by Thomas Young. Its unit symbol as an SI prefix in the International System of Units (SI) is the lower case letter h.

The prefix is rarely used in general, but has certain specific applications:
* hectopascal (hPa), in meteorology, for atmospheric pressure, the modern equivalent of the traditional millibar.
* hectolitre (hl or hL), in agriculture, for liquids (notably milk and alcoholic beverages) and bulk commodities (e.g., grain).
* hectogram (hg), in agronomy, for quantities of animal feed (hectogram/animal) and for measures of agricultural productivity (hectogram/hectare); also used in Italy abbreviated as , and in Canada, New Zealand and Sweden simply as 100 g, for retail sale of cold cuts and meat.
* hectometre (hm), in radio astronomy, occasionally used to indicate a radio band by wavelength
* In surveying, a square hectometre is called a hectare (ha, or 100 &quot;ares&quot; = 1 hm2 = 10,000 m2).

<doc id="203956" wikidata="Q1567213" url="?curid=203956" title="Inverse problem">
<text>An inverse problem in science is the process of calculating from a set of observations the causal factors that produced them: for example, calculating an image in X-ray computed tomography, source reconstruction in acoustics, or calculating the density of the Earth from measurements of its gravity field. It is called an inverse problem because it starts with the effects and then calculates the causes. It is the inverse of a forward problem, which starts with the causes and then calculates the effects.

Inverse problems are some of the most important mathematical problems in science and mathematics because they tell us about parameters that we cannot directly observe. They can be found in system identification, optics, radar, acoustics, communication theory, signal processing, medical imaging, computer vision, geophysics, oceanography, astronomy, remote sensing, natural language processing, machine learning, nondestructive testing, slope stability analysis and many other fields.

==History==
Starting with the effects to discover the causes has concerned physicists for centuries. A historical example is the calculations of Adams and Le Verrier which led to the discovery of Neptune from the perturbed trajectory of Uranus. However, a formal study of inverse problems was not initiated until the 20th century.

One of the earliest examples of a solution to an inverse problem was discovered by Hermann Weyl and published in 1911, describing the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues of the Laplace–Beltrami operator. Today known as &quot;Weyl&#x27;s law&quot;, it is perhaps most easily understood as an answer to the question of whether it is possible to hear the shape of a drum. Weyl conjectured that the eigenfrequencies of a drum would be related to the area and perimeter of the drum by a particular equation, a result improved upon by later mathematicians.

The field of inverse problems was later touched on by Soviet-Armenian physicist, Viktor Ambartsumian.

While still a student, Ambartsumian thoroughly studied the theory of atomic structure, the formation of energy levels, and the Schrödinger equation and its properties, and when he mastered the theory of eigenvalues of differential equations, he pointed out the apparent analogy between discrete energy levels and the eigenvalues of differential equations. He then asked: given a family of eigenvalues, is it possible to find the form of the equations whose eigenvalues they are? Essentially Ambartsumian was examining the inverse Sturm–Liouville problem, which dealt with determining the equations of a vibrating string. This paper was published in 1929 in the German physics journal &quot;Zeitschrift für Physik&quot; and remained in obscurity for a rather long time. Describing this situation after many decades, Ambartsumian said, &quot;If an astronomer publishes an article with a mathematical content in a physics journal, then the most likely thing that will happen to it is oblivion.&quot;

Nonetheless, toward the end of the Second World War, this article, written by the 20-year-old Ambartsumian, was found by Swedish mathematicians and formed the starting point for a whole area of research on inverse problems, becoming the foundation of an entire discipline.

Then important efforts have been devoted to a &quot;direct solution&quot; of the inverse scattering problem especially by Gelfand and Levitan in the Soviet Union. They proposed an analytic constructive method for determining the solution. When computers became available, some authors have investigated the possibility of applying their approach to similar problems such as the inverse problem in the 1D wave equation. But it rapidly turned out that the inversion is an unstable process: noise and errors can be tremendously amplified making a direct solution hardly practicable.
Then, around the seventies, the least-squares and probabilistic approaches came in and turned out to be very helpful for the determination of parameters involved in various physical systems. This approach met a lot of success. Nowadays inverse problems are also investigated in fields outside physics, such as chemistry, economics, and computer science. Eventually, as numerical models become prevalent in many parts of society, we may expect an inverse problem associated with each of these numerical models.

==Conceptual understanding==
Since Newton, scientists have extensively attempted to model the world. In particular, when a mathematical model is available (for instance, Newton&#x27;s gravitational law or Coulomb&#x27;s equation for electrostatics), we can foresee, given some parameters that describe a physical system (such as a distribution of mass or a distribution of electric charges), the behavior of the system. This approach is known as mathematical modeling and the above-mentioned physical parameters are called the model parameters or simply the model. To be precise, we introduce the notion of state of the physical system: it is the solution of the mathematical model&#x27;s equation. In optimal control theory, these equations are referred to as the state equations. In many situations we are not truly interested in knowing the physical state but just its effects on some objects (for instance, the effects the gravitational field has on a specific planet). Hence we have to introduce another operator, called the observation operator, which converts the state of the physical system (here the predicted gravitational field) into what we want to observe (here the movements of the considered planet). We can now introduce the so-called forward problem, which consists of two steps:
* determination of the state of the system from the physical parameters that describe it
* application of the observation operator to the estimated state of the system so as to predict the behavior of what we want to observe.
This leads to introduce another operator formula_1 (&quot;F&quot; stands for &quot;forward&quot;) which maps model parameters formula_2 into formula_3, the data that model formula_2 predicts that is the result of this two-step procedure. Operator formula_1 is called forward operator or forward map.
In this approach we basically attempt at predicting the effects knowing the causes.

The table below shows, the Earth being considered as the physical system and for different physical phenomena, the model parameters that describe the system, the physical quantity that describes the state of the physical system and observations commonly made on the state of the system. 

In the inverse problem approach we, roughly speaking, try to know the causes given the effects.

==General statement of the inverse problem==
The inverse problem is the &quot;inverse&quot; of the forward problem: instead of determining the data produced by particular model parameters, we want to determine the model parameters that produce the data formula_6 that is the observation we have recorded (the subscript obs stands for observed).
Our goal, in other words, is to determine the model parameters formula_2 such that (at least approximately)
formula_8
where formula_1 is the forward map. We denote by formula_10 the (possibly infinite) number of model parameters, and by formula_11 the number of recorded data.
We introduce some useful concepts and the associated notations that will be used below:
* The space of models denoted by formula_12: the vector space spanned by model parameters; it has formula_10 dimensions;
* The space of data denoted by formula_14: formula_15 if we organize the measured samples in a vector with formula_11 components (if our measurements consist of functions, formula_14 is a vector space with infinite dimensions);
* formula_3: the response of model formula_2; it consists of the data predicted by model formula_2;
* formula_21: the image of formula_12 by the forward map, it is a subset of formula_14 (but not a subspace unless formula_1 is linear) made of responses of all models;
* formula_25: the data misfits (or residuals) associated with model formula_2: they can be arranged as a vector, an element of formula_14.
The concept of residuals is very important: in the scope of finding a model that matches the data, their analysis reveals if the considered model can be considered as realistic or not. Systematic unrealistic discrepancies between the data and the model responses also reveals that the forward map is inadequate and may give insights about an improved forward map.

When operator formula_1 is linear, the inverse problem is linear. Otherwise, that is most often, the inverse problem is nonlinear.
Also, models cannot always be described by a finite number of parameters. It is the case when we look for distributed parameters (a distribution of wave-speeds for instance): in such cases the goal of the inverse problem is to retrieve one or several functions. Such inverse problems are inverse problems with infinite dimension.

==Linear inverse problems==
In the case of a linear forward map and when we deal with a finite number of model parameters, the forward map can be written as a linear system
formula_29
where formula_1 is the matrix that characterizes the forward map. The linear system can be solved by means of both regularization and Bayesian methods. 

===An elementary example: Earth&#x27;s gravitational field===
Only a few physical systems are actually linear with respect to the model parameters. One such system from geophysics is that of the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field. The Earth&#x27;s gravitational field is determined by the density distribution of the Earth in the subsurface. Because the lithology of the Earth changes quite significantly, we are able to observe minute differences in the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field on the surface of the Earth. From our understanding of gravity (Newton&#x27;s Law of Gravitation), we know that the mathematical expression for gravity is:
formula_31
here formula_32 is a measure of the local gravitational acceleration, formula_33 is the universal gravitational constant, formula_2 is the local mass (which is related to density) of the rock in the subsurface and formula_35 is the distance from the mass to the observation point.

By discretizing the above expression, we are able to relate the discrete data observations on the surface of the Earth to the discrete model parameters (density) in the subsurface that we wish to know more about. For example, consider the case where we have measurements carried out at 5 locations on the surface of the Earth. In this case, our data vector, formula_32 is a column vector of dimension (5×1): its formula_37-th component is associated with the formula_37-th observation location. We also know that we only have five unknown masses formula_39 in the subsurface (unrealistic but used to demonstrate the concept) with known location: we denote by formula_40 the distance between the formula_37-th observation location and the formula_42-th mass. Thus, we can construct the linear system relating the five unknown masses to the five data points as follows:
formula_43
formula_44
formula_45

To solve for the model parameters that fit our data, we might be able to invert the matrix formula_1 to directly convert the measurements into our model parameters. For example:
formula_47
A system with five equations and five unknowns is a very specific situation: our example was designed to end up with this specificity. In general, the numbers of data and unknowns are different so that matrix formula_1 is not square.

However, even a square matrix can have no inverse: matrix formula_1 can be rank deficient (i.e. has zero eigenvalues) and the solution of the system formula_50 is not unique. Then the solution of the inverse problem will be undetermined. This is a first difficulty. Over-determined systems (more equations than unknowns) have other issues.
Also noise may corrupt our observations making formula_32 possibly outside the space formula_21 of possible responses to model parameters so that solution of the system formula_50 may not exist. This is another difficulty.

==== Tools to overcome the first difficulty ====
The first difficulty reflects a crucial problem: Our observations do not contain enough information and additional data are required. Additional data can come from physical prior information on the parameter values, on their spatial distribution or, more generally, on their mutual dependence. It can also come from other experiments: For instance, we may think of integrating data recorded by gravimeters and seismographs for a better estimation of densities. 
The integration of this additional information is basically a problem of statistics. This discipline is the one that can answer the question: How to mix quantities of different nature? We will be more precise in the section &quot;Bayesian approach&quot; below.

Concerning distributed parameters, prior information about their spatial distribution often consists of information about some derivatives of these distributed parameters. Also, it is common practice, although somewhat artificial, to look for the &quot;simplest&quot; model that reasonably matches the data. This is usually achieved by penalizing the formula_54 norm of the gradient (or the total variation) of the parameters (this approach is also referred to as the maximization of the entropy). One can also make the model simple through a parametrization that introduces degrees of freedom only when necessary.

Additional information may also be integrated through inequality constraints on the model parameters or some functions of them. Such constraints are important to avoid unrealistic values for the parameters (negative values for instance). In this case, the space spanned by model parameters will no longer be a vector space but a subset of admissible models denoted by formula_55 in the sequel.

==== Tools to overcome the second difficulty ====
As mentioned above, noise may be such that our measurements are not the image of any model, so that we cannot look for a model that produces the data but rather look for the best (or optimal) model: that is, the one that best matches the data. This leads us to minimize an objective function, namely a functional that quantifies how big the residuals are or how far the predicted data are from the observed data. Of course, when we have perfect data (i.e. no noise) then the recovered model should fit the observed data perfectly. A standard objective function, formula_56, is of the form:
formula_57
where formula_58 is the Euclidean norm (it will be the formula_59 norm when the measurements are functions instead of samples) of the residuals. This approach amounts to making use of ordinary least squares, an approach widely used in statistics. However, the Euclidean norm is known to be very sensitive to outliers: to avoid this difficulty we may think of using other distances, for instance the formula_54 norm, in replacement of the formula_59 norm.

==== Bayesian approach ====
Very similar to the least-squares approach is the probabilistic approach: If we know the statistics of the noise that contaminates the data, we can think of seeking the most likely model m, which is the model that matches the maximum likelihood criterion. If the noise is Gaussian, the maximum likelihood criterion appears as a least-squares criterion, the Euclidean scalar product in data space being replaced by a scalar product involving the co-variance of the noise. Also, should prior information on model parameters be available, we could think of using Bayesian inference to formulate the solution of the inverse problem. This approach is described in detail in Tarantola&#x27;s book.

==== Numerical solution of our elementary example ====
Here we make use of the Euclidean norm to quantify the data misfits. As we deal with a linear inverse problem, the objective function is quadratic. For its minimization, it is classical to compute its gradient using the same rationale (as we would to minimize a function of only one variable). At the optimal model formula_62, this gradient vanishes which can be written as:
formula_63
where &quot;F&quot;T denotes the matrix transpose of &quot;F&quot;. This equation simplifies to:
formula_64

This expression is known as the normal equation and gives us a possible solution to the inverse problem. 
In our example matrix formula_65 turns out to be generally full rank so that the equation above makes sense and determines uniquely the model parameters: we do not need integrating additional information for ending up with a unique solution.

=== Mathematical and computational aspects ===

Inverse problems are typically ill-posed, as opposed to the well-posed problems usually met in mathematical modeling. Of the three conditions for a well-posed problem suggested by Jacques Hadamard (existence, uniqueness, and stability of the solution or solutions) the condition of stability is most often violated. In the sense of functional analysis, the inverse problem is represented by a mapping between metric spaces. While inverse problems are often formulated in infinite dimensional spaces, limitations to a finite number of measurements, and the practical consideration of recovering only a finite number of unknown parameters, may lead to the problems being recast in discrete form. In this case the inverse problem will typically be &quot;ill-conditioned&quot;. In these cases, regularization may be used to introduce mild assumptions on the solution and prevent overfitting. Many instances of regularized inverse problems can be interpreted as special cases of Bayesian inference.

==== Numerical solution of the optimization problem ====
Some inverse problems have a very simple solution, for instance, when one has a set of unisolvent functions, meaning a set of functions such that evaluating them at distinct points yields a set of linearly independent vectors. This means that given a linear combination of these functions, the coefficients can be computed by arranging the vectors as the columns of a matrix and then inverting this matrix. The simplest example of unisolvent functions is polynomials constructed, using the unisolvence theorem, so as to be unisolvent. Concretely, this is done by inverting the Vandermonde matrix. But this a very specific situation.

In general, the solution of an inverse problem requires sophisticated optimization algorithms. When the model is described by a large number of parameters (the number of unknowns involved in some diffraction tomography applications can reach one billion), solving the linear system associated with the normal equations can be cumbersome. The numerical method to be used for solving the optimization problem depends in particular on the cost required for computing the solution formula_66 of the forward problem. Once chosen the appropriate algorithm for solving the forward problem (a straightforward matrix-vector multiplication may be not adequate when matrix formula_1 is huge), the appropriate algorithm for carrying out the minimization can be found in textbooks dealing with numerical methods for the solution of linear systems and for the minimization of quadratic functions (see for instance Ciarlet or Nocedal).

Also, the user may wish to add physical constraints to the models: In this case, they have to be familiar with constrained optimization methods, a subject in itself. In all cases, computing the gradient of the objective function often is a key element for the solution of the optimization problem. As mentioned above, information about the spatial distribution of a distributed parameter can be introduced through the parametrization. One can also think of adapting this parametrization during the optimization.

Should the objective function be based on a norm other than the Euclidean norm, we have to leave the area of quadratic optimization. As a result, the optimization problem becomes more difficult. In particular, when the formula_54 norm is used for quantifying the data misfit the objective function is no longer differentiable: its gradient does not make sense any longer. Dedicated methods (see for instance Lemaréchal) from non differentiable optimization come in.

Once the optimal model is computed we have to address the question: &quot;Can we trust this model?&quot; The question can be formulated as follows: How large is the set of models that match the data &quot;nearly as well&quot; as this model? In the case of quadratic objective functions, this set is contained in a hyper-ellipsoid, a subset of formula_69 (formula_10 is the number of unknowns), whose size depends on what we mean with &quot;nearly as well&quot;, that is on the noise level. The direction of the largest axis of this ellipsoid (eigenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue of matrix formula_71) is the direction of poorly determined components: if we follow this direction, we can bring a strong perturbation to the model without changing significantly the value of the objective function and thus end up with a significantly different quasi-optimal model. We clearly see that the answer to the question &quot;can we trust this model&quot; is governed by the noise level and by the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the objective function or equivalently, in the case where no regularization has been integrated, by the singular values of matrix formula_1. Of course, the use of regularization (or other kinds of prior information) reduces the size of the set of almost optimal solutions and, in turn, increases the confidence we can put in the computed solution.

==== Stability, regularization and model discretization in infinite dimension ====

We focus here on the recovery of a distributed parameter.
When looking for distributed parameters we have to discretize these unknown functions. Doing so, we reduce the dimension of the problem to something finite. But now, the question is: is there any link between the solution we compute and the one of the initial problem? Then another question: what do we mean with the solution of the initial problem? Since a finite number of data does not allow the determination of an infinity of unknowns, the original data misfit functional has to be regularized to ensure the uniqueness of the solution. Many times, reducing the unknowns to a finite-dimensional space will provide an adequate regularization: the computed solution will look like a discrete version of the solution we were looking for. For example, a naive discretization will often work for solving the deconvolution problem: it will work as long as we do not allow missing frequencies to show up in the numerical solution. But many times, regularization has to be integrated explicitly in the objective function.

In order to understand what may happen, we have to keep in mind that solving such a linear inverse problem amount to solving a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind: 
formula_73

where formula_74 is the kernel, formula_75 and formula_76 are vectors of formula_77, and formula_78 is a domain in formula_77. This holds for a 2D application. For a 3D application, we consider formula_80. Note that here the model parameters formula_2 consist of a function and that the response of a model also consists of a function denoted by formula_82. This equation is an extension to infinite dimension of the matrix equation formula_83 given in the case of discrete problems.

For sufficiently smooth formula_74 the operator defined above is compact on reasonable Banach spaces such as the formula_59. F. Riesz theory states that the set of singular values of such an operator contains zero (hence the existence of a null-space), is finite or at most countable, and, in the latter case, they constitute a sequence that goes to zero. In the case of a symmetric kernel, we have an infinity of eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors constitute a hilbertian basis of formula_59. Thus any solution of this equation is determined up to an additive function in the null-space and, in the case of infinity of singular values, the solution (which involves the reciprocal of arbitrary small eigenvalues) is unstable: two ingredients that make the solution of this integral equation a typical ill-posed problem! However, we can define a solution through the pseudo-inverse of the forward map (again up to an arbitrary additive function). When the forward map is compact, the classical Tikhonov regularization will work if we use it for integrating prior information stating that the formula_59 norm of the solution should be as small as possible: this will make the inverse problem well-posed. Yet, as in the finite dimension case, we have to question the confidence we can put in the computed solution. Again, basically, the information lies in the eigenvalues of the Hessian operator. Should subspaces containing eigenvectors associated with small eigenvalues be explored for computing the solution, then the solution can hardly be trusted: some of its components will be poorly determined. The smallest eigenvalue is equal to the weight introduced in Tikhonov regularization.

Irregular kernels may yield a forward map which is not compact and even unbounded if we naively equip the space of models with the formula_59 norm. In such cases, the Hessian is not a bounded operator and the notion of eigenvalue does not make sense any longer. A mathematical analysis is required to make it a bounded operator and design a well-posed problem: an illustration can be found in. Again, we have to question the confidence we can put in the computed solution and we have to generalize the notion of eigenvalue to get the answer.

Analysis of the spectrum of the Hessian operator is thus a key element to determine how reliable the computed solution is. However, such an analysis is usually a very heavy task. This has led several authors to investigate alternative approaches in the case where we are not interested in all the components of the unknown function but only in sub-unknowns that are the images of the unknown function by a linear operator. These approaches are referred to as the &quot; Backus and Gilbert method&quot;, Lions&#x27;s sentinels approach, and the SOLA method: these approaches turned out to be strongly related with one another as explained in Chavent Finally, the concept of limited resolution, often invoked by physicists, is nothing but a specific view of the fact that some poorly determined components may corrupt the solution. But, generally speaking, these poorly determined components of the model are not necessarily associated with high frequencies.

===Some classical linear inverse problems for the recovery of distributed parameters===
The problems mentioned below correspond to different versions of the Fredholm integral: each of these is associated with a specific kernel formula_74.

====Deconvolution====
The goal of deconvolution is to reconstruct the original image or signal formula_90 which appears as noisy and blurred on the data formula_82.
From a mathematical point of view, the kernel formula_92 here only depends on the difference between formula_75 and formula_76.

====Tomographic methods====
In these methods we attempt at recovering a distributed parameter, the observation consisting in the measurement of the integrals of this parameter carried out along a family of lines. We denote by formula_95 the line in this family associated with measurement point formula_75. The observation at formula_75 can thus be written as:
formula_98
where formula_99 is the arc-length along formula_100 and formula_101 a known weighting function. Comparing this equation with the Fredholm integral above, we notice that the kernel formula_92 is kind of a delta function that peaks on line formula_100. With such a kernel, the forward map is not compact.

===== Computed tomography =====
In X-ray computed tomography the lines on which the parameter is integrated are straight lines: the tomographic reconstruction of the parameter distribution is based on the inversion of the Radon transform. Although from a theoretical point of view many linear inverse problems are well understood, problems involving the Radon transform and its generalisations still present many theoretical challenges with questions of sufficiency of data still unresolved. Such problems include incomplete data for the x-ray transform in three dimensions and problems involving the generalisation of the x-ray transform to tensor fields. Solutions explored include Algebraic Reconstruction Technique, filtered backprojection, and as computing power has increased, iterative reconstruction methods such as iterative Sparse Asymptotic Minimum Variance.

===== Diffraction tomography =====
Diffraction tomography is a classical linear inverse problem in exploration seismology: the amplitude recorded at one time for a given source-receiver pair is the sum of contributions arising from points such that the sum of the distances, measured in traveltimes, from the source and the receiver, respectively, is equal to the corresponding recording time. In 3D the parameter is not integrated along lines but over surfaces. Should the propagation velocity be constant, such points are distributed on an ellipsoid. The inverse problems consists in retrieving the distribution of diffracting points from the seismograms recorded along the survey, the velocity distribution being known. A direct solution has been originally proposed by Beylkin and Lambaré et al.: these works were the starting points of approaches known as amplitude preserved migration (see Beylkin and Bleistein). Should geometrical optics techniques (i.e. rays) be used for the solving the wave equation, these methods turn out to be closely related to the so-called least-squares migration methods derived from the least-squares approach (see Lailly, Tarantola).

===== Doppler tomography (astrophysics) =====

If we consider a rotating stellar object, the spectral lines we can observe on a spectral profile will be shifted due to Doppler effect. Doppler tomography aims at converting the information contained in spectral monitoring of the object into a 2D image of the emission (as a function of the radial velocity and of the phase in the periodic rotation movement) of the stellar atmosphere. As explained by Tom Marsh this linear inverse problem is tomography like: we have to recover a distributed parameter which has been integrated along lines to produce its effects in the recordings.

==== Inverse heat conduction ====

Early publications on inverse heat conduction arose from determining surface heat flux during atmospheric re-entry from buried temperature sensors.
Other applications where surface heat flux is needed but surface sensors are not practical include: inside reciprocating engines, inside rocket engines; and, testing of nuclear reactor components. A variety of numerical techniques have been developed to address the ill-posedness and sensitivity to measurement error caused by damping and lagging in the temperature signal.

==Non-linear inverse problems==

Non-linear inverse problems constitute an inherently more difficult family of inverse problems. Here the forward map formula_1 is a non-linear operator. Modeling of physical phenomena often relies on the solution of a partial differential equation (see table above except for gravity law): although these partial differential equations are often linear, the physical parameters that appear in these equations depend in a non-linear way of the state of the system and therefore on the observations we make on it.

=== Some classical non-linear inverse problems ===

==== Inverse scattering problems ====

Whereas linear inverse problems were completely solved from the theoretical point of view at the end of the nineteenth century , only one class of nonlinear inverse problems was so before 1970, that of inverse spectral and (one space dimension) inverse scattering problems, after the seminal work of the Russian mathematical school (Krein, Gelfand, Levitan, Marchenko). A large review of the results has been given by Chadan and Sabatier in their book &quot;Inverse Problems of Quantum Scattering Theory&quot; (two editions in English, one in Russian).

In this kind of problem, data are properties of the spectrum of a linear operator which describe the scattering. The spectrum is made of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, forming together the &quot;discrete spectrum&quot;, and generalizations, called the continuous spectrum. The very remarkable physical point is that scattering experiments give information only on the continuous spectrum, and that knowing its full spectrum is both necessary and sufficient in recovering the scattering operator. Hence we have invisible parameters, much more interesting than the null space which has a similar property in linear inverse problems. In addition, there are physical motions in which the spectrum of such an operator is conserved as a consequence of such motion. This phenomenon is governed by special nonlinear partial differential evolution equations, for example the Korteweg–de Vries equation. If the spectrum of the operator is reduced to one single eigenvalue, its corresponding motion is that of a single bump that propagates at constant velocity and without deformation, a solitary wave called a &quot;soliton&quot;.

A perfect signal and its generalizations for the Korteweg–de Vries equation or other integrable nonlinear partial differential equations are of great interest, with many possible applications. This area has been studied as a branch of mathematical physics since the 1970s. Nonlinear inverse problems are also currently studied in many fields of applied science (acoustics, mechanics, quantum mechanics, electromagnetic scattering - in particular radar soundings, seismic soundings, and nearly all imaging modalities).

A final example related to the Riemann hypothesis was given by Wu and Sprung, the idea is that in the semiclassical old quantum theory the inverse of the potential inside the Hamiltonian is proportional to the half-derivative of the eigenvalues (energies) counting function &quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

====Permeability matching in oil and gas reservoirs====
The goal is to recover the diffusion coefficient in the parabolic partial differential equation that models single phase fluid flows in porous media. This problem has been the object of many studies since a pioneering work carried out in the early seventies. Concerning two-phase flows an important problem is to estimate the relative permeabilities and the capillary pressures.

==== Inverse problems in the wave equations ====

The goal is to recover the wave-speeds (P and S waves) and the density distributions from seismograms. Such inverse problems are of prime interest in seismology and exploration geophysics.
We can basically consider two mathematical models:
* The acoustic wave equation (in which S waves are ignored when the space dimensions are 2 or 3)
* The elastodynamics equation in which the P and S wave velocities can be derived from the Lamé parameters and the density.
These basic hyperbolic equations can be upgraded by incorporating attenuation, anisotropy, ...

The solution of the inverse problem in the 1D wave equation has been the object of many studies. It is one of the very few non-linear inverse problems for which we can prove the uniqueness of the solution. The analysis of the stability of the solution was another challenge. Practical applications, using the least-squares approach, were developed.
Extension to 2D or 3D problems and to the elastodynamics equations was attempted since the 80&#x27;s but turned out to be very difficult ! This problem often referred to as Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), is not yet completely solved: among the main difficulties are the existence of non-Gaussian noise into the seismograms, cycle-skipping issues (also known as phase ambiguity), and the chaotic behavior of the data misfit function. Some authors have investigated the possibility of reformulating the inverse problem so as to make the objective function less chaotic than the data misfit function.

==== Travel-time tomography ====

Realizing how difficult is the inverse problem in the wave equation, seismologists investigated a simplified approach making use of geometrical optics. In particular they aimed at inverting for the propagation velocity distribution, knowing the arrival times of wave-fronts observed on seismograms. These wave-fronts can be associated with direct arrivals or with reflections associated with reflectors whose geometry is to be determined, jointly with the velocity distribution.

The arrival time distribution formula_105 (formula_75 is a point in physical space) of a wave-front issued from a point source, satisfies the Eikonal equation:
formula_107
where formula_108 denotes the slowness (reciprocal of the velocity) distribution. The presence of formula_58 makes this equation nonlinear. It is classically solved by shooting rays (trajectories about which the arrival time is stationary) from the point source.

This problem is tomography like: the measured arrival times are the integral along the ray-path of the slowness. But this tomography like problem is nonlinear, mainly because the unknown ray-path geometry depends upon the velocity (or slowness) distribution. In spite of its nonlinear character, travel-time tomography turned out to be very effective for determining the propagation velocity in the Earth or in the subsurface, the latter aspect being a key element for seismic imaging, in particular using methods mentioned in Section &quot;Diffraction tomography&quot;.

=== Mathematical aspects: Hadamard&#x27;s questions ===

The questions concern well-posedness: Does the least-squares problem have a unique solution which depends continuously on the data (stability problem)? It is the first question, but it is also a difficult one because of the non-linearity of formula_1. 
In order to see where the difficulties arise from, Chavent proposed to conceptually split the minimization of the data misfit function into two consecutive steps (formula_55 is the subset of admissible models):
* projection step: given formula_6 find a projection on formula_113 (nearest point on formula_113 according to the distance involved in the definition of the objective function)
* given this projection find one pre-image that is a model whose image by operator formula_1 is this projection.
Difficulties can - and usually will - arise in both steps:
# operator formula_1 is not likely to be one-to-one, therefore there can be more than one pre-image,
# even when formula_1 is one-to-one, its inverse may not be continuous over formula_21,
# the projection on formula_113 may not exist, should this set be not closed,
# the projection on formula_113 can be non-unique and not continuous as this can be non-convex due to the non-linearity of formula_1.
We refer to Chavent for a mathematical analysis of these points.

=== Computational aspects ===

==== A non-convex data misfit function ====
The forward map being nonlinear, the data misfit function is likely to be non-convex, making local minimization techniques inefficient. Several approaches have been investigated to overcome this difficulty: 
* use of global optimization techniques such as sampling of the posterior density function and Metropolis algorithm in the inverse problem probabilistic framework, genetic algorithms (alone or in combination with Metropolis algorithm: see for an application to the determination of permeabilities that match the existing permeability data), neural networks, regularization techniques including multi scale analysis;
* reformulation of the least-squares objective function so as to make it smoother (see for the inverse problem in the wave equations.)

==== Computation of the gradient of the objective function ====

Inverse problems, especially in infinite dimension, may be large size, thus requiring important computing time. When the forward map is nonlinear, the computational difficulties increase and minimizing the objective function can be difficult. Contrary to the linear situation, an explicit use of the Hessian matrix for solving the normal equations does not make sense here: the Hessian matrix varies with models. Much more effective is the evaluation of the gradient of the objective function for some models. Important computational effort can be saved when we can avoid the very heavy computation of the Jacobian (often called &quot;Fréchet derivatives&quot;): the adjoint state method, proposed by Chavent and Lions, is aimed to avoid this very heavy computation. It is now very widely used.
==Applications==
Inverse problem theory is used extensively in weather predictions, oceanography, hydrology, and petroleum engineering. Another application is inversion of elastic waves for non-destructive characterization of engineering structures.

Inverse problems are also found in the field of heat transfer, where a surface heat flux is estimated outgoing from temperature data measured inside a rigid body; and, in understanding the controls on plant-matter decay. The linear inverse problem is also the fundamental of spectral estimation and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in signal processing.

Inverse lithography is used in photomask design for semiconductor device fabrication.

== Academic journals ==
Four main academic journals cover inverse problems in general:
*&quot;Inverse Problems&quot;
*&quot;Journal of Inverse and Ill-posed Problems&quot;
*&quot;Inverse Problems in Science and Engineering&quot;

<doc id="203958" wikidata="Q160092" url="?curid=203958" title="Rubus chamaemorus">
<text>Rubus chamaemorus is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. Its English common names include cloudberry, Nordic berry, bakeapple (in Newfoundland and Labrador), knotberry and knoutberry (in England), aqpik or low-bush salmonberry (in Alaska – not to be confused with salmonberry, &quot;Rubus spectabilis&quot;), and averin or evron (in Scotland).&lt;ref name=&quot;foodb.ca/00161&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A herbaceous perennial, it produces amber-colored, edible fruit similar to the blackberry. It is native to cool temperate regions, alpine and Arctic tundra, and boreal forest. 

==Description==

Unlike most &quot;Rubus&quot; species, the cloudberry is dioecious, and fruit production by a female plant requires pollination from a male plant.

The cloudberry grows to high. The leaves alternate between having five and seven soft, handlike lobes on straight, branchless stalks. After pollination, the white (sometimes reddish-tipped) flowers form raspberry-sized aggregate fruits, which are more plentiful in wooded rather than sun-exposed habitats. Consisting of between five and 25 drupelets, each fruit is initially pale red, ripening into an amber color in early autumn.

=== Chemistry ===
Cloudberries are rich in vitamin C and ellagic acid, citric acid, malic acid, , anthocyanins, and the provitamin A carotenoid, in contents that differ across regions of Finland due to sunlight exposure, rainfall, or temperature. The ellagitannins lambertianin C and sanguiin H-6 are also present. Genotype of cloudberry variants may also affect polyphenol composition, particularly for ellagitannins, sanguiin , anthocyanins and quercetin.

==Distribution and habitat==
Cloudberries are a circumpolar boreal plant, occurring naturally throughout the Northern Hemisphere from 78°N, south to about 55°N, and are scattered south to 44°N mainly in mountainous areas and moorlands. In Europe, they grow in the Nordic countries, but are rare in the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) and Poland. They are present in the English Pennines and the Scottish Highlands, while a single, fragile site exists in the Sperrin Mountains of Northern Ireland. They occur across northern Russia east towards the Pacific Ocean as far south as Japan in the island of Hokkaido.

In North America, cloudberries grow wild across Greenland, most of northern Canada, Alaska, northern Minnesota, New Hampshire, Maine, and New York.

Wide distribution occurs due to the excretion of the indigestible seeds by birds and mammals. Further distribution arises through its rhizomes, which are up to long and grow about below the soil surface, developing extensive and dense berry patches. Cuttings of these taken in May or August are successful in producing a genetic clone of the parent plant. The cloudberry grows in bogs, marshes, wet meadows, and tundra, and at elevations of above sea level in Norway, requiring acidic ground (between 3.5 and 5.0 pH).

==Ecology==
Cloudberry leaves are food for caterpillars of several Lepidoptera species. The moth &quot;Coleophora thulea&quot; has no other known food plants.

==Conservation==
Due to peatland drainage and peat exploitation, they are considered endangered and are under legal protection in Germany&#x27;s Weser and Elbe Valleys.

==Cultivation==

Despite great demand as a delicacy (particularly in Sweden, Norway, and Finland), the cloudberry is not widely cultivated and is primarily a wild plant. Wholesale prices vary widely based on the size of the yearly harvest, but cloudberries have gone for as little as €10/kg (in 2004).

Since the middle of the 1990s, however, the species has formed part of a multinational research project. Beginning in 2002, selected cultivars have been available to farmers, notably &#x27;Apolto&#x27; (male), &#x27;Fjellgull&#x27; (female), and &#x27;Fjordgull&#x27; (female). Finnish self-pollinated &#x27;Nyby&#x27; variety is monoecious, i.e. the female and male flowers are located in the same plant unit. The cloudberry can be cultivated in Arctic areas where few other crops are possible, for example along the northern coast of Norway.

==Uses==


When ripe, cloudberry fruits are golden-yellow, soft, and juicy, and are rich in vitamin C. When eaten fresh, cloudberries have a distinctive tart taste. When over-ripe, they have a creamy texture somewhat like yogurt and a sweet flavor.&lt;ref name=&quot;farmflavor/cloudberries&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They are often made into jams, juices, tarts, and liqueurs. In Finland, the berries are eaten with heated (a local cheese; the name translates to &quot;bread-cheese&quot;), as well as cream and sugar. In Sweden, cloudberries (, also known in northern Sweden as &quot;snattren&quot;) and cloudberry jam are used as a topping for ice cream, pancakes, and waffles. Cloudberry &quot;filmjölk&quot; (soured milk) is available in supermarkets.

In Norway, they are often mixed with whipped cream and sugar to be served as a dessert called (cloudberry cream), as a jam or as an ingredient in homemade ice cream. Cloudberry yoghurt— or —is a supermarket item in Norway.

In Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, cloudberries are used to make &quot;bakeapple pie&quot; or jam. Arctic Yup&#x27;ik mix the berries with seal oil, reindeer or caribou fat (which is diced and made fluffy with seal oil) and sugar to make &quot;Eskimo ice cream&quot; or &quot;akutaq&quot;. The recipes vary by region. Along the Yukon and Kuskokwim River areas, white fish (pike) along with shortening and sugar are used. The berries are an important traditional food resource for the Yup&#x27;ik.

Due to its high vitamin C content, the berry is valued both by Nordic seafarers and Northern indigenous peoples. Its polyphenol content, including flavonoid compounds such as ellagic acid, appears to naturally preserve food preparations of the berries. Cloudberries can be preserved in their own juice without added sugar, if stored cool.

Extract of cloudberries is also used in cosmetics such as shower gels, hand creams&#x27; and body lotions.

===Alcoholic drinks===
In Nordic countries, traditional liqueurs such as (Finland) are made of cloudberry,&lt;ref name=&quot;aaflora/roruch&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; having a strong taste and high sugar content. Cloudberry is used as a flavouring for making &quot;akvavit&quot;. In northeastern Quebec, a cloudberry liqueur known as (Innu-aimun name) is made.

Polyphenol extracts from cloudberries have improved storage properties when microencapsulated using maltodextrin . At least 14 volatile compounds, including vanillin, account for the aroma of cloudberries.

===Harvesting on public property===
In some northern European countries such as Norway, a common-use policy on non-wood forest products allows anyone to pick cloudberries on public property and eat them on location, but only local residents may transport them from that location. Transporting ripe cloudberries from the harvest location is permitted in many counties.

Harvesting unripe cloudberries in Norway was illegal between 1970 and 2004. Many people believe that it is still illegal to harvest unripe cloudberries in Norway, but that law is no longer in effect.

==In culture==

The cloudberry appears on the Finnish version of the 2 euro coin. The name of the hill in Breadalbane in the Scottish Highlands means &quot;Hill of the Cloudberries&quot; in Scottish Gaelic. Transactions of Camden&#x27;s Britain (1637 edition) indicate the etymological origins of &#x27;cloud-berry&#x27;, the plant&#x27;s name in old Lancashire dialect: &#x27;Pendelhill [in Lancashire] advenceth itselfe up the skie ... and in the very top thereof bringeth forth a peculiar plant which, as though it came out of the clowdes, they tearme clowdes-berry&#x27;. In Norrland cloudberries are known as Norrland&#x27;s gold.

<text>The New Zealand Wars () took place from 1845 to 1872 between the New Zealand colonial government and allied Māori on one side, and Māori and Māori-allied settlers on the other. Though the wars were initially localised conflicts triggered by tensions over disputed land purchases (by European settlers from Māori), they escalated dramatically from 1860 as the government became convinced it was facing united Māori resistance to further land sales and a refusal to acknowledge Crown sovereignty. The colonial government summoned thousands of British troops to mount major campaigns to overpower the Kīngitanga (Māori King) movement and also conquest of farming and residential land for British settlers. Later campaigns were aimed at quashing the Pai Mārire religious and political movement, which was strongly opposed to the conquest of Māori land and eager to strengthen Māori identity. Māori religious movements that promoted pan-Māori identity played a major role in the Wars.

At the peak of hostilities in the 1860s, 18,000 British Army troops, supported by artillery, cavalry and local militia, battled about 4,000 Māori warriors in what became a gross imbalance of manpower and weaponry. Although outnumbered, the Māori were able to withstand their enemy with techniques that included anti-artillery bunkers and the use of carefully placed pā (fortified villages) that allowed them to block their enemy&#x27;s advance and often inflict heavy losses, yet quickly abandon their positions without significant loss. Guerrilla-style tactics were used by both sides in later campaigns, often fought in dense bush. Over the course of the Taranaki and Waikato campaigns, the lives of about 1,800 Māori and 800 Europeans were lost, and total Māori losses over the course of all the wars may have exceeded 2,100.

Violence over land ownership broke out first in the Wairau Valley in the South Island in June 1843, but rising tensions in Taranaki eventually led to the involvement of British military forces at Waitara in March 1860. The war between the government and Kīngitanga Māori spread to other areas of the North Island, with the biggest single campaign being the invasion of the Waikato in 1863–1864, before hostilities concluded with the pursuits of Riwha Tītokowaru in Taranaki (1868–1869) and Rangatira (chief) Te Kooti Arikirangi Te Turuki on the east coast (1868–1872).

Although Māori were initially fought by British Army forces, the New Zealand government developed its own military force, including local militia, rifle volunteer groups, the specialist Forest Rangers and kūpapa (pro-government Māori). As part of broader Australian involvement in the wars, the Colony of Victoria deployed its naval forces, and at least 2,500 volunteers formed contingents that crossed the Tasman Sea and integrated with the New Zealand militia. The government also responded with legislation to imprison Māori opponents and confiscate expansive areas of the North Island for sale to settlers, with the funds used to cover war expenses; punitive measures that on the east and west coasts provoked an intensification of Māori resistance and aggression.

The New Zealand Wars were previously referred to as the Land Wars or the Māori Wars, and an earlier Māori-language name for the conflict was (&quot;the white man&#x27;s anger&quot;). Historian James Belich popularised the name &quot;New Zealand Wars&quot; in the 1980s, although according to Vincent O&#x27;Malley, the term was first used by historian James Cowan in the 1920s.

==Background==
The 1840 English language version of the Treaty of Waitangi guaranteed that individual Māori (tribes) should have undisturbed possession of their lands, forests, fisheries and other in return for becoming British subjects, selling land to the government only (the right of pre-emption) and surrendering sovereignty to the British Crown. In the Māori language version of the Treaty, however, the word &quot;sovereignty&quot; was translated as which was a new word meaning &quot;governance&quot;. This led to considerable disagreement over the meaning of the Treaty. Some Māori wanted to sign to consolidate peace and in hopes of ending the long intertribal Musket Wars (1807–1845) others wanted to keep their , such as Tūhoe in Te Urewera.

All pre-treaty colonial land-sale deals had taken place directly between two parties. In the early period of contact, Māori had generally sought trade with Europeans. The British and the French had established mission stations, and missionaries had received land from iwi for houses, schools, churches, and farms.

Traders, Sydney businessmen and the New Zealand Company had bought large tracts of land before 1840. The Treaty of Waitangi included the right of Crown pre-emption on land sales, and the New Zealand colonial government, pressured by immigrant European settlers, tried to speed up land sales to provide farmland. This met resistance from the Kīngitanga (Māori King) movement that emerged in the 1850s and opposed further European encroachment.

Governor Thomas Gore Browne&#x27;s provocative purchase of a disputed block of land at Waitara in 1859 set the government on a collision course with the Kīngitanga movement, and the government interpreted the response as a challenge to the Crown&#x27;s authority. Governor Gore Browne succeeded in bringing 3,500 Imperial troops from the Australian colonies to quash this perceived challenge, and within four years a total of 9,000 British troops had arrived in New Zealand, assisted by more than 4,000 colonial and (pro-government Māori) fighters as the government sought a decisive victory over the &quot;rebel&quot; Māori.

The use of a punitive land confiscation policy from 1865, depriving &quot;rebel&quot; Māori of the means of living, fuelled further Māori anger and resentment, fanning the flames of conflict in Taranaki (1863–1866) and on the east coast (1865–1866).

==History==

===Conflicts===

The various conflicts of the New Zealand wars span a considerable period, and the causes and outcomes differ widely. The earliest conflicts in the 1840s happened at a time when Māori were still the predominant power, but by the 1860s settler numbers and resources were much greater. From about 1862 British troops began arriving in much greater number, summoned by Governor George Grey for his Waikato invasion, and in March 1864 total troop numbers peaked at about 14,000 (9,000 Imperial troops, more than 4,000 colonial and a few hundred &quot;kūpapa&quot;).

====Wairau Affray====

The first armed conflict between Māori and the European settlers took place on 17 June 1843 in the Wairau Valley, in the north of the South Island. The clash was sparked when settlers led by a representative of the New Zealand Company—which held a false title deed to a block of land—attempted to clear Māori off the land ready for surveying. The party also attempted to arrest Ngāti Toa chiefs Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata. Fighting broke out and 22 Europeans were killed, as well as four to six Māori. Nine of the Europeans were slain after being captured. In early 1844, the new governor, Robert FitzRoy, investigated the incident and declared the settlers were at fault. The Wairau Affray—described as the Wairau Massacre in early texts—was the only armed conflict of the New Zealand Wars to take place in the South Island.

====Northern War====

The Flagstaff War took place in the far north of New Zealand, around the Bay of Islands, between March 1845 and January 1846, and was the first major conflict between the British and Māori people. In 1845 George Grey arrived in New Zealand to take up his appointment as governor. At this time Hōne Heke challenged the authority of the British, beginning by cutting down the flagstaff on Flagstaff Hill at Kororāreka. The flagstaff had previously flown the colours of United Tribes of New Zealand but now carried the Union Jack and therefore symbolised the grievances of Heke and his ally Te Ruki Kawiti, as to changes that had followed the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.

There were many causes of the Flagstaff War and Heke had a number of grievances in relation to the Treaty of Waitangi. While land acquisition by the Church Missionary Society (CMS) had been controversial, the rebellion led by Heke was directed against the colonial forces with the CMS missionaries trying to persuade Heke to end the fighting. Despite the fact that Tāmati Wāka Nene and most of Ngāpuhi sided with the government, the small and ineptly led British force had been beaten at the Battle of Ōhaeawai. Grey, with the financial support and far more troops armed with 32-pounder cannons that had been denied to FitzRoy, attacked and occupied Kawiti&#x27;s fortress at Ruapekapeka, forcing Kawiti to retreat. Heke&#x27;s confidence waned after he was wounded in battle with Tāmati Wāka Nene and his warriors, and by the realisation that the British had far more resources than he could muster, including some Pākehā Māori, who supported the colonial forces.

After the Battle of Ruapekapeka, Heke and Kawiti were ready for peace. They approached Tāmati Wāka Nene to act as the intermediary to negotiate with Governor Grey, who accepted the advice of Nene that Heke and Kawiti should not be punished for their rebellion. The fighting in the north ended and there was no punitive confiscation of Ngāpuhi land.

====Hutt Valley and Wanganui campaigns====

The Hutt Valley campaign of 1846 came as a sequel to the Wairau Affray. The causes were similar—dubious land purchases by the New Zealand Company and the desire of the settlers to move on to land before disputes over titles were resolved—and the two conflicts shared many of the same protagonists. The campaign&#x27;s most notable clashes were the Māori dawn raid on an imperial stockade at Boulcott&#x27;s Farm on 16 May 1846 in which eight British soldiers and an estimated two Māori died, and the Battle of Battle Hill from 6–13 August as British troops, local militia and &quot;kūpapa&quot; pursued a Ngāti Toa force led by chief Te Rangihaeata through steep and dense bushland. Ngāti Toa chief Te Rauparaha was also taken into custody during the campaign; he was detained without charge in Auckland for two years.

The bloodshed heightened settlers&#x27; fears in nearby Wanganui, which was given a strong military force to guard against attack. In April 1847 an accidental shooting of a minor Wanganui Māori chief led to a bloody revenge attack on a settler family; when the perpetrators were captured and hanged, a major raid was launched on the town as a reprisal, with homes plundered and burned and livestock stolen. Māori besieged the town before mounting a frontal attack in July 1847. A peace settlement was reached in early 1848.

====First Taranaki War====

The catalyst for the First Taranaki War was the disputed sale to the Crown of a 240 hectare block of land at Waitara, despite a veto by the paramount chief of Te Āti Awa tribe, Wiremu Kīngi Te Rangitāke, and a &quot;solemn contract&quot; by local Māori not to sell. Governor Browne accepted the purchase with full knowledge of the circumstances and tried to occupy the land, anticipating it would lead to armed conflict, and a demonstration of the substantive sovereignty the British believed they had gained in the Treaty of Waitangi. Hostilities began on 17 March 1860. The war was fought by more than 3,500 imperial troops brought in from Australia, as well as volunteer soldiers and militia, against Māori forces that fluctuated between a few hundred and about 1,500. In response to a call from Governor Browne for reinforcements, the Victorian Government sent its first and only warship, HMVS &quot;Victoria&quot;, to supply men and perform shore bombardments and coastal patrols, while maintaining supply routes between ports. Sailors from the crew served ashore in combat, and in August 1860, the &quot;Victoria&quot; rescued 100 civilians from the besieged town of New Plymouth. The ship&#x27;s service in the First Taranaki War marks the first time an Australian military unit committed to active service overseas, and is today recognised by the Royal Australian Navy as its earliest battle honour.

After a series of battles and actions the war ended in a ceasefire, with neither side explicitly accepting the peace terms of the other. Total losses among the imperial, volunteer and militia troops are estimated to have been 238, while Māori casualties totalled about 200. Though there were claims by the British that they had won the war, there were widely held views at the time they had suffered an unfavourable and humiliating result. Historians have also been divided on the result. Historian James Belich has claimed that Māori succeeded in thwarting the British bid to impose sovereignty over them, and had therefore been victorious. Belich also states that the Māori victory was a hollow one, leading to the invasion of the Waikato.

====Invasion of the Waikato====
Browne began making arrangements for a Waikato campaign to destroy the Kīngitanga stronghold at the close of the First Taranaki War. Preparations were suspended in December 1861 when he was replaced by Sir George Grey, but Grey revived plans for an invasion in June 1863. He persuaded the Colonial Office in London to send more than 10,000 Imperial troops to New Zealand and General Sir Duncan Cameron was appointed to lead the campaign. Cameron used soldiers to build the 18 km-long Great South Road to the border of Kīngitanga territory and on 9 July 1863 Grey ordered all Māori living between Auckland and the Waikato take an oath of allegiance to Queen Victoria or be expelled south of the Waikato River; when his ultimatum was rejected the vanguard of the army crossed the frontier into Kīngitanga territory and established a forward camp. A long series of bush raids on his supply lines forced Cameron to build an extensive network of forts and redoubts through the area. In a continual buildup of force, Cameron eventually had 14,000 British and colonial soldiers at his disposal, including 2,500 volunteers from Australia who were integrated into the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Waikato militia regiments; as well as steamers and armoured vessels for use on the Waikato River. They fought a combined Māori contingent of about 4,000.

Cameron and his Kīngitanga foe engaged in several major battles including the Battle of Rangiriri and a three-day siege at Orakau, capturing the Kīngitanga capital of Ngāruawāhia in December 1863, before completing their Waikato conquest in April 1864. The Waikato campaign cost the lives of 700 British and colonial soldiers and about 1,000 Māori.

The Kīngitanga Māori retreated into the rugged interior of the North Island and in 1865 the New Zealand Government confiscated about 12,000 km2 of Māori land (4% of New Zealand&#x27;s land area) for white settlement—an action that quickly provoked the Second Taranaki War.

====Tauranga campaign====

The six-month long Tauranga campaign of 1864 was initially launched by Cameron to disrupt Māori supply lines and secure the Bay of Plenty for European settlement. It was marked by strategic maneuvering and intense battles between British Imperial forces and local Māori tribes, primarily Ngāi Te Rangi. The campaign faced internal political divisions early on with Premier Frederick Whitaker supporting an aggressive approach, while Governor Grey advocated a defensive stance to prevent wider rebellion. The conflict culminated in the Battle of Gate Pā in April, where Māori defenders, under the leadership of Rawiri Puhirake, successfully repelled a British assault, inflicting significant casualties and earning a reputation as a humiliating defeat for the British.

Following the setback, efforts to negotiate peace intensified, with Governor Grey seeking to limit land confiscations and reduce Māori resistance, leading to a temporary cessation of hostilities. However, in June, Māori forces, reinforced and commanded by Hoera te Mataatai, chose to engage the British again at Te Ranga. In a decisive battle, the British forces, led by Brigadier George Carey, overcame Māori entrenchments, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides. The Tauranga campaign concluded with the surrender of Ngāi Te Rangi warriors, marking a turning point in the New Zealand Wars and shaping subsequent negotiations between Māori and the colonial government.

====Second Taranaki War====

Between 1863 and 1866 there was a resumption of hostilities between Māori and the New Zealand Government in Taranaki, which is sometimes referred to as the Second Taranaki War. The conflict, which overlapped the wars in Waikato and Tauranga, was fuelled by a combination of factors: lingering Māori resentment over the sale of land at Waitara in 1860 and government delays in resolving the issue; a large-scale land confiscation policy launched by the government in late 1863; and the rise of the so-called Hauhau movement, an extremist part of the Pai Marire syncretic religion, which was strongly opposed to the alienation of Māori land and eager to strengthen Māori identity. The Hauhau movement became a unifying factor for Taranaki Māori in the absence of individual Māori commanders.

The style of warfare after 1863 differed markedly from that of the 1860–1861 conflict, in which Māori had taken set positions and challenged the army to an open contest. From 1863, the army, working with greater numbers of troops and heavy artillery, systematically took possession of Māori land by driving off the inhabitants, adopting a &quot;scorched earth&quot; strategy of laying waste to Māori villages and cultivations, with attacks on villages, whether warlike or otherwise. Historian Brian Dalton noted: &quot;The aim was no longer to conquer territory, but to inflict the utmost &#x27;punishment&#x27; on the enemy; inevitably there was a great deal of brutality, much burning of undefended villages and indiscriminate looting, in which loyal Maoris often suffered.&quot; As the troops advanced, the Government built an expanding line of redoubts, behind which settlers built homes and developed farms. The effect was a creeping confiscation of almost of land, with little distinction between the land of loyal or rebel Māori owners. The outcome of the armed conflict in Taranaki between 1860 and 1869 was a series of enforced confiscations of Taranaki tribal land from Māori blanketed as being in rebellion against the Government.

====East Cape War====
East coast hostilities erupted in April 1865 and, as in the Second Taranaki War, sprang from Māori resentment of punitive government land confiscations coupled with the embrace of radical Pai Marire expression. The religion arrived on the east coast from Taranaki in early 1865. The subsequent ritual killing of missionary Carl Volkner by Pai Mārire (or Hauhau) followers at Ōpōtiki on 2 March 1865 sparked settler fears of an outbreak of violence and later that year the New Zealand government launched a lengthy expedition to hunt for Volkner&#x27;s killers and neutralise the movement&#x27;s influence. Rising tensions between Pai Mārire followers and conservative Māori led to a number of wars between and within Māori &quot;iwi&quot;, with &quot;kūpapa&quot; armed by the government in a bid to exterminate the movement.

Major conflicts within the campaign included the cavalry and artillery attack on Te Tarata pā near Ōpōtiki in October 1865 in which about 35 Māori were killed, and the seven-day siege of Waerenga-a-Hika in November 1865. The government confiscated northern parts of Urewera land in January 1866 in a bid to break down supposed Māori support for Volkner&#x27;s killers and confiscated additional land in Hawke&#x27;s Bay a year later after a rout of a Māori party it deemed a threat to the settlement of Napier.

====Tītokowaru&#x27;s War====

War flared again in Taranaki in June 1868 as Riwha Tītokowaru, chief of Ngāruahine, responded to the continued surveying and settlement of confiscated land with well-planned and effective attacks on settlers and government troops in an effort to block the occupation of Māori land. Coinciding with a violent raid on a European settlement on the East Coast by Te Kooti, the attacks shattered what European colonists regarded as a new era of peace and prosperity, creating fears of a &quot;general uprising of hostile Māoris&quot;.

Tītokowaru, who had fought in the Second Taranaki War, was the most skilful West Coast Māori warrior. He also assumed the roles of a priest and prophet of the extremist Hauhau movement of the Pai Mārire religion, reviving ancient rites of cannibalism and propitiation of Māori gods with the human heart torn from the first slain in a battle. Although Tītokowaru&#x27;s forces were numerically small and initially outnumbered in battle twelve to one by government troops, the ferocity of their attacks provoked fear among settlers and prompted the resignation and desertion of many militia volunteers, ultimately leading to the withdrawal of most government military forces from South Taranaki and giving Tītokowaru control of almost all territory between New Plymouth and Wanganui. Although Tītokowaru provided the strategy and leadership that had been missing among tribes that had fought in the Second Taranaki War and his forces never lost a battle during their intensive campaign, they mysteriously abandoned a strong position at Tauranga-ika Pā and Tītokowaru&#x27;s army immediately began to disperse. Kimble Bent, who lived as a slave with Tītokowaru&#x27;s &quot;hapū&quot; after deserting from the 57th Regiment, told Cowan 50 years later the chief had lost his &quot;mana tapu&quot;, or sacred power, after committing adultery with the wife of another chief.

Once Tītokowaru was defeated and the East Coast threat minimised, the alienation of Māori land, as well as the political subjugation of Māori, continued at an even more rapid pace.

====Te Kooti&#x27;s War====

Te Kooti&#x27;s War was fought in the East Coast region and across the heavily forested central North Island and Bay of Plenty between government military forces and followers of spiritual leader Te Kooti Arikirangi Te Turuki. The conflict was sparked by Te Kooti&#x27;s return to New Zealand after two years of internment on the Chatham Islands, from where he had escaped with almost 200 Māori prisoners of war and their families. Te Kooti, who had been held without trial on the island for two years, asked that he and his followers be left in peace, but within two weeks they were being pursued by a force of militia, government troops and Māori volunteers. The pursuit turned into a four-year guerrilla war, involving more than 30 expeditions by colonial and Māori troops against Te Kooti&#x27;s dwindling number of warriors.

Although initially fighting defensively against pursuing government forces, Te Kooti went on the offensive from November 1868, starting with the so-called Poverty Bay massacre, a well-organised lightning strike against selected European settlers and Māori opponents in the Matawhero district, in which 51 men, women and children were slaughtered and their homes set alight. The attack prompted another vigorous pursuit by government forces, which included a siege at Ngatapa pā that came to a bloody end: although Te Kooti escaped the siege, Māori forces loyal to the government caught and executed more than 130 of his supporters, as well as prisoners he had earlier seized. Dissatisfied with the Māori King Movement&#x27;s reluctance to continue its fight against European invasion and confiscation, Te Kooti offered Māori an Old Testament vision of salvation from oppression and a return to a promised land. Wounded three times in battle, he gained a reputation for being immune to death and uttered prophecies that had the appearance of being fulfilled. In early 1870 Te Kooti gained refuge from Tūhoe tribes, which consequently suffered a series of damaging raids in which crops and villages were destroyed, after other Māori &quot;iwi&quot; were lured by the promise of a £5,000 reward for Te Kooti&#x27;s capture. Te Kooti was finally granted sanctuary by the Māori king in 1872 and moved to the King Country, where he continued to develop rituals, texts and prayers of his Ringatū faith. He was formally pardoned by the government in February 1883 and died in 1893.

A 2013 Waitangi Tribunal report said the action of Crown forces on the East Coast from 1865 to 1869—the East Coast Wars and the start of Te Kooti&#x27;s War—resulted in the deaths of proportionately more Māori than in any other district during the New Zealand wars. It condemned the &quot;illegal imprisonment&quot; on the Chatham Islands of a quarter of the East Coast region&#x27;s adult male population and said the loss in war of an estimated 43 percent of the male population, many through acts of &quot;lawless brutality&quot;, was a stain on New Zealand&#x27;s history and character.

==Participants==
The New Zealand campaigns involved Māori warriors from a range of &quot;iwi&quot;, most of which were allied with the Kīngitanga movement, fighting a mix of Imperial troops, local militia groups, the specialist Forest Rangers and kūpapa, or &quot;loyalist&quot; Māori.

===Imperial===

In 1855 just 1,250 Imperial troops, from two under-strength British regiments, were in New Zealand. Although both were scheduled to depart at the end of the year, Browne succeeded in retaining one of them for use in New Plymouth, where settlers feared the spread of intertribal violence. At the outbreak of Taranaki hostilities in 1860, reinforcements were brought from Auckland to boost the New Plymouth garrison, raising the total force of regulars to 450 and for many months the total number of Māori under arms exceeded the number of troops in Taranaki. In mid-April the arrival of three warships and about 400 soldiers from Australia marked the beginning of the escalation of imperial troop numbers.

The buildup increased rapidly under Grey&#x27;s term as governor: when the second round of hostilities broke out in Taranaki in May 1863 he applied to the Secretary of State in London for the immediate dispatch of three more regiments and also wrote to the Australian governors asking for whatever British troops that could be made available. Lieutenant-General Duncan Cameron, the Commander-in-Chief of the British troops in New Zealand, began the Waikato invasion in July with fewer than 4,000 effective troops in Auckland at his disposal, but the continuous arrival of regiments from overseas rapidly swelled the force.

The Colonial Defence Force, a cavalry unit of about 100 men, was formed by Colonel Marmaduke Nixon in May 1863 and served in Waikato and militia forces were also used throughout the New Zealand wars. The Militia Ordinance 1845 provided for the compulsory training or service within 40 km of their town by all able-bodied European men aged between 18 and 60; the Auckland Militia and Volunteers reached a peak of about 1650 on active service in the early stages of the Waikato campaign; and the last force—the Taranaki Militia—was released from service in 1872.
A special 65-man bush-scouring corps, the Forest Rangers, composed of local farmers who were familiar with the bush, had proven guerrilla techniques and were capable of &quot;roughing it&quot;, was formed in August 1863; the Forest Rangers split into two separate companies in November, with the second led by Gustavus von Tempsky and both served in Waikato and Taranaki. Other rangers corps during the New Zealand wars included the Taranaki Bush Rangers, Patea Rangers, Opotiki Volunteer Rangers, Wanganui Bush Rangers and Wellington Rangers. From September 1863 the first contingents of what was planned as 5,000 military settlers—recruited on the goldfields of Australia and Otago with promises of free grants of land confiscated from &quot;rebel&quot; Māori—also began service in the Waikato. By the end of October the number of military settlers, known as the Waikato Militia, had reached more than 2,600, the majority having come from Australia. By March 1864 troop numbers peaked at 9,000 Imperial troops, 4,000 Colonial troops (3,600 of them Australians), a few hundred &quot;kūpapa&quot; (Māori that fought for the British) for a combined force of about 14,000.

In November 1864 Premier Frederick Weld introduced a policy of &quot;self-reliance&quot; for New Zealand, which included the gradual but complete withdrawal of Imperial troops, who would be replaced by a colonial force of 1,500. The move came at a time of rising conflict between Grey, who sought more extensive military operations to &quot;pacify&quot; the west coast of the North Island between Taranaki and Wanganui, and Cameron, who regarded such a campaign as unnecessary, impractical and contrary to Imperial policy. Grey blocked Cameron&#x27;s attempts to dispatch the first regiments from New Zealand in May 1865 and the first regiment finally embarked in January 1866. By May 1867 only the 2/18th Regiment remained in the country, their departure delayed by political pressure over the &quot;peril&quot; still facing settlers; the last soldiers finally left in February 1870.

===Māori===

About 15 of the 26 major North Island tribal groups sent contingents to join the Waikato campaign, although sometimes they represented a single &quot;hapū&quot; (clan) within the tribe. Continual presence on battlefields remained difficult for most, however, because of the constant need for tribal labour in their home community, so there was a constant turnover of small tribal groups. At Meremere, Paterangi, Hangatiki and Maungatatauri, between August 1863 and June 1864 Māori maintained forces of between 1,000 and 2,000 men, but troops were forced to disperse after each campaign because of labour and domestic needs at home. Belich has estimated that the total Māori mobilisation was at least 4,000 warriors, representing one-third of the total manpower available.

Although they were not part of a structured command system, Māori generally followed a consistent strategic plan, uniting to build skilfully engineered defensive lines up to long. Māori united under proven military commanders, including Rewi Maniapoto and Tikaokao of Ngāti Maniapoto and Wiremu Tamihana of Ngāti Hauā.

==Strategy and tactics==
Campaigners on both sides of the New Zealand wars had developed distinctive war strategies and tactics. The British set out to fight a European-style war, based on engaging with the opposing forces, besieging and then capturing fortified positions. The British Army were professional soldiers who had experience fighting in various parts of the Empire, many from India and Afghanistan and were led by officers who were themselves trained by men who had fought at Waterloo.

Many of the Māori fighters had been raised during the Musket Wars, the decades-long bitter intertribal fighting during which warriors had perfected the art of building defensive fortifications around a &quot;pā&quot;. During the Flagstaff War, Kawiti and Heke appear to have followed a strategy of drawing the colonial forces into attacking a fortified pā, from which the warriors could fight from a strong defensive position that was secure from cannon fire.

The word &quot;pā&quot; means a fortified strong point near a Māori village or community. They were built with a view to defence, but primarily they were built to safely store food. The &quot;pā&quot; at Puketutu and Ōhaeawai were the first of the so-called &quot;gunfighter &quot;pā&quot;&quot;, built to engage enemies armed with muskets and cannons. A strong, wooden palisade was fronted with woven flax leaves (&quot;Phormium tenax&quot;) whose tough, stringy foliage absorbed much of the force of the ammunition. The palisade was lifted a few centimetres from the ground so muskets could be fired from underneath rather than over the top. Sometimes there were gaps in the palisade, which led to killing traps. There were trenches and rifle pits to protect the occupants and, later, very effective artillery shelters. They were usually built so that they were almost impossible to surround completely, but usually presented at least one exposed face to invite attack from that direction. They were cheap and easily built—the L-Pa at Waitara was constructed by 80 men overnight—and they were completely expendable. The British repeatedly mounted often lengthy expeditions to besiege a &quot;pā&quot;, which would absorb their bombardment and possibly one or two attacks, and then be abandoned by the Māori. Shortly afterwards, a new &quot;pā&quot; would appear in another inaccessible site. &quot;Pā&quot; like these were built in the dozens, particularly during the First Taranaki War, where they eventually formed a cordon surrounding New Plymouth and in the Waikato campaign.
For a long time, the modern &quot;pā&quot; effectively neutralised the overwhelming disparity in numbers and armaments. At Ōhaeawai Pā in 1845, at Rangiriri in 1863 and again at Gate Pā in 1864, British and colonial forces discovered that frontal attacks on a defended &quot;pā&quot; were extremely costly. At Gate Pā, during the 1864 Tauranga Campaign, Māori withstood a day-long bombardment in their underground shelters and trenches. The palisade destroyed, the British troops rushed the &quot;pā&quot;, whereupon Māori fired on them from hidden trenches, killing 38 and injuring many more in the most costly battle for the Pākehā of the New Zealand Wars. The troops retired and Māori abandoned the &quot;pā&quot;.

While the British could defeat Māori in battle, the defeats were often not decisive. For example, the capture of Ruapekapeka Pā can be considered a British tactical victory, but it was purpose-built as a target for the British, and its loss was not damaging; Heke and Kawiti managed to escape with their forces intact.

However the British force consisted of professional soldiers supported by an economic system capable of sustaining them in the field almost indefinitely, in contrast, the Māori warrior was a part-time fighter who also needed to work on producing food. The biggest problem for the Māori was that their society was ill-adapted to support a sustained campaign. A long campaign would disrupt food supplies and epidemics resulted in significant numbers of deaths among the Māori.

The British soon realised this was an easier way to neutralise a &quot;pā&quot;. Although cheap and easy to build, a gunfighter &quot;pā&quot; required a significant input of labour and resources. The destruction of the Māori economic base in the area around the &quot;pā&quot; made it difficult for the &quot;hapū&quot; to support the fighting men. This was the reasoning behind the bush-scouring expeditions of Chute and McDonnell in the Second Taranaki War.

==Weapons==
The main weapon used by the British forces in the 1860s was the Pattern 1853 Enfield. Properly described as a rifled musket, it was loaded down the barrel like a conventional musket but the barrel was rifled. While muskets were accurate to about 60–80 m, an 1853 Enfield was accurate to about 300 m to 400 m in the hands of an experienced soldier; at 100 m an experienced soldier could easily hit a human target. The rifle was 1.44 m long, weighed 4 kg and had a 53 cm socket bayonet. This rifle was also commonly used in the American Civil War by both sides.

The Calisher and Terry carbine (short rifle) was ordered by the New Zealand Government from Calisher and Terry, Birmingham gunsmiths in 1861 after earlier fighting against Māori showed the need for a carbine suited to fighting in heavy bush. This was the favoured weapon of the New Zealand Forest Rangers because of its shortness, its lightness, and its ability to be reloaded while the marksman lay down—unlike the Enfield, which required the soldier to stand to load the powder—and could be loaded on the run. This feature led to a decisive victory for the Forest Rangers at Orakau: several groups of soldiers harried the fleeing Māori but only the Forest Rangers, equipped with carbines, were able to follow them 10 km to the Puniu River shooting as they went.

Revolvers were mainly used by officers but were a general issue for the Forest Rangers. The most common revolver appears to have been the five-shot Beaumont–Adams .44 percussion revolver. Other revolvers in use were the Colt Navy .36 1851 model with open top frame. The Colt was favoured by the Forest Rangers because it was light and accurate being a single-action revolver. Von Tempsky&#x27;s second company of the Forest Rangers also used the Bowie knife.

== Aftermath ==

Large areas of land were confiscated from the Māori by the government under the New Zealand Settlements Act in 1863, purportedly as punishment for rebellion. In reality, land was confiscated from both &quot;loyal&quot; and &quot;rebel&quot; tribes alike. More than of land was confiscated. Although about half of this was subsequently paid for or returned to Māori control, it was often not returned to its original owners. The confiscations had a lasting impact on the social and economic development of the affected tribes.

In the immediate aftermath of the wars in Taranaki, and land confiscations, a new town Parihaka was founded by Te Whiti o Rongomai, based on principles of non-violent resistance. Parihaka&#x27;s population grew to over 2,000 before the government sent the constabulary to arrest Te Whiti and his supporters on 5 November 1881. Another incident in the aftermath of the New Zealand Wars was the so-called Dog Tax War of 1898.

The legacy of the New Zealand Wars continues, but these days the battles are mostly fought in courtrooms and around the negotiation table. Numerous reports by the Waitangi Tribunal have criticised Crown actions during the wars, and also found that the Māori, too, had breached the treaty. As part of the negotiated out-of-court settlements of tribes&#x27; historical claims (Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements), as of 2011 the Crown is making formal apologies to tribes.

== Commemoration ==

The National Day of Commemoration for the New Zealand Wars was inaugurated in 2017 and is held on 28 October. In 2019, a commemorative plaque was unveiled for the New Zealand Wars in the New Zealand House of Representatives.

==The New Zealand history curriculum==

The Day of Commemoration came about after a group of students from Otorohanga College in New Zealand had presented a petition to parliament in 2015 asking for more recognition of the Wars as an example of New Zealand history that should be taught in the country&#x27;s schools. This was agreed to by the government and Jacinda Ardern, the Prime Minister announced in 2019 that within a revised curriculum, the teaching of history would be compulsory in New Zealand. A draft curriculum document was developed and trialled in 2021, and in March 2022 Aotearoa New Zealand Histories and Te Takanga o te Wa, English- and Māori-medium were officially launched.

<text>Ben Cheese (1955 – 21 January 2001) was a British engineer who worked on Sinclair&#x27;s ZX Microdrives. Authors Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy, in their book &quot;Sinclair and the &quot;Sunrise&quot; Technology&quot;, write that &quot;it seems only fair to note that it was the tenacity and imagination of R&amp;D staffer Ben Cheese that got the product [i.e., the Microdrive] to the market&quot;.

When Sinclair was sold, Cheese formed a company called Flare Technology with two other former Sinclair engineers, John Mathieson and Martin Brennan. Brennan and Mathieson went on to form Flare II, and to develop the Atari Jaguar console. Meanwhile, Cheese worked with Argonaut Software and Nintendo to develop the Super FX chip used in Super Nintendo Entertainment System games such as &quot;Star Fox&quot;.

Besides his engineering work, Ben Cheese also drew some mildly subversive cartoons for the Sinclair in-house newsletter called &quot;WHAM!&quot;, or &quot;What&#x27;s Happening At Milton&quot;.

Ben Cheese died from cancer at age 46.

<text>In mathematics, Itô&#x27;s lemma or Itô&#x27;s formula is an identity used in Itô calculus to find the differential of a time-dependent function of a stochastic process. It serves as the stochastic calculus counterpart of the chain rule. It can be heuristically derived by forming the Taylor series expansion of the function up to its second derivatives and retaining terms up to first order in the time increment and second order in the Wiener process increment. The lemma is widely employed in mathematical finance, and its best known application is in the derivation of the Black–Scholes equation for option values.

This result was discovered by Japanese mathematician Kiyoshi Itô in 1951.

== Motivation ==
Suppose we are given the stochastic differential equation
formula_1
where is a Wiener process and the functions formula_2 are deterministic (not stochastic) functions of time. In general, it&#x27;s not possible to write a solution formula_3 directly in terms of formula_4 However, we can formally write an integral solution
formula_5

This expression lets us easily read off the mean and variance of formula_3 (which has no higher moments). First, notice that every formula_7 individually has mean 0, so the expected value of formula_3 is simply the integral of the drift function:
formula_9

Similarly, because the formula_10 terms have variance 1 and no correlation with one another, the variance of formula_3 is simply the integral of the variance of each infinitesimal step in the random walk:
formula_12

However, sometimes we are faced with a stochastic differential equation for a more complex process formula_13 in which the process appears on both sides of the differential equation. That is, say
formula_14
for some functions formula_15 and formula_16 In this case, we cannot immediately write a formal solution as we did for the simpler case above. Instead, we hope to write the process formula_17 as a function of a simpler process formula_3 taking the form above. That is, we want to identify three functions formula_19 and formula_20 such that formula_21 and formula_22 In practice, Ito&#x27;s lemma is used in order to find this transformation. Finally, once we have transformed the problem into the simpler type of problem, we can determine the mean and higher moments of the process.

== Derivation ==

We derive Itô&#x27;s lemma by expanding a Taylor series and applying the rules of stochastic calculus.

Suppose formula_3 is an Itô drift-diffusion process that satisfies the stochastic differential equation

:formula_24

where is a Wiener process.

If is a twice-differentiable scalar function, its expansion in a Taylor series is

:formula_25

:formula_26

Then use the total derivative and the definition of the partial derivative formula_27:

:formula_28

Substituting formula_29 and therefore formula_30, we get

:formula_31

In the limit formula_32, the terms formula_33 and formula_34 tend to zero faster than formula_35. formula_36 is formula_37 (due to the quadratic variation of a Wiener process which says formula_38), so setting formula_39 and formula_40 terms to zero and substituting formula_35 for formula_36, and then collecting the formula_35 terms, we obtain

:formula_44

as required.

Alternatively,

:formula_45

== Geometric intuition ==

Suppose we know that formula_46 are two jointly-Gaussian distributed random variables, and formula_47 is nonlinear but has continuous second derivative, then in general, neither of formula_48 is Gaussian, and their joint distribution is also not Gaussian. However, since formula_49 is Gaussian, we might still find formula_50 is Gaussian. This is not true when formula_35 is finite, but when formula_35 becomes infinitesimal, this becomes true.

The key idea is that formula_53 has a deterministic part and a noisy part. When formula_47 is nonlinear, the noisy part has a deterministic contribution. If formula_47 is convex, then the deterministic contribution is positive (by Jensen&#x27;s inequality).

To find out how large the contribution is, we write formula_56, where formula_57 is a standard Gaussian, then perform Taylor expansion. formula_58We have split it into two parts, a deterministic part, and a random part with mean zero. The random part is non-Gaussian, but the non-Gaussian parts decay faster than the Gaussian part, and at the formula_59 limit, only the Gaussian part remains. The deterministic part has the expected formula_60, but also a part contributed by the convexity: formula_61.

To understand why there should be a contribution due to convexity, consider the simplest case of geometric Brownian walk (of the stock market): formula_62. In other words, formula_63. Let formula_64, then formula_65, and formula_3 is a Brownian walk. However, although the expectation of formula_3 remains constant, the expectation of formula_68 grows. Intuitively it is because the downside is limited at zero, but the upside is unlimited. That is, while formula_3 is normally distributed, formula_68 is log-normally distributed.

== Mathematical formulation of Itô&#x27;s lemma ==
In the following subsections we discuss versions of Itô&#x27;s lemma for different types of stochastic processes.

=== Itô drift-diffusion processes (due to: Kunita–Watanabe)===
In its simplest form, Itô&#x27;s lemma states the following: for an Itô drift-diffusion process

:formula_71

and any twice differentiable scalar function of two real variables and , one has

:formula_72

This immediately implies that is itself an Itô drift-diffusion process.

In higher dimensions, if formula_73 is a vector of Itô processes such that

:formula_74

for a vector formula_75 and matrix formula_76, Itô&#x27;s lemma then states that

:formula_77

where formula_78 is the gradient of w.r.t. , is the Hessian matrix of w.r.t. , and is the trace operator.

=== Poisson jump processes ===
We may also define functions on discontinuous stochastic processes.

Let be the jump intensity. The Poisson process model for jumps is that the probability of one jump in the interval is plus higher order terms. could be a constant, a deterministic function of time, or a stochastic process. The survival probability is the probability that no jump has occurred in the interval . The change in the survival probability is

:formula_79

So

:formula_80

Let be a discontinuous stochastic process. Write formula_81 for the value of &quot;S&quot; as we approach &quot;t&quot; from the left. Write formula_82 for the non-infinitesimal change in as a result of a jump. Then

:formula_83

Let &quot;z&quot; be the magnitude of the jump and let formula_84 be the distribution of &quot;z&quot;. The expected magnitude of the jump is

:formula_85

Define formula_86, a compensated process and martingale, as

:formula_87

Then

:formula_88

Consider a function formula_89 of the jump process . If jumps by then jumps by . is drawn from distribution formula_90 which may depend on formula_91, &quot;dg&quot; and formula_81. The jump part of formula_93 is

:formula_94

If formula_95 contains drift, diffusion and jump parts, then Itô&#x27;s Lemma for formula_89 is

:formula_97

Itô&#x27;s lemma for a process which is the sum of a drift-diffusion process and a jump process is just the sum of the Itô&#x27;s lemma for the individual parts.

=== Non-continuous semimartingales ===
Itô&#x27;s lemma can also be applied to general -dimensional semimartingales, which need not be continuous. In general, a semimartingale is a càdlàg process, and an additional term needs to be added to the formula to ensure that the jumps of the process are correctly given by Itô&#x27;s lemma.
For any cadlag process , the left limit in is denoted by , which is a left-continuous process. The jumps are written as . Then, Itô&#x27;s lemma states that if is a -dimensional semimartingale and &quot;f&quot; is a twice continuously differentiable real valued function on then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is a semimartingale, and

:formula_98

This differs from the formula for continuous semi-martingales by the additional term summing over the jumps of &quot;X&quot;, which ensures that the jump of the right hand side at time is Δ&quot;f&quot;(&quot;Xt&quot;).

==== Multiple non-continuous jump processes ====
There is also a version of this for a twice-continuously differentiable in space once in time function f evaluated at (potentially different) non-continuous semi-martingales which may be written as follows:
:formula_99 denotes the continuous part of the &quot;i&quot;th semi-martingale.

== Examples ==

=== Geometric Brownian motion ===
A process S is said to follow a geometric Brownian motion with constant volatility &quot;σ&quot; and constant drift &quot;μ&quot; if it satisfies the stochastic differential equation formula_100, for a Brownian motion &quot;B&quot;. Applying Itô&#x27;s lemma with formula_101 gives

:formula_102

It follows that

:formula_103

exponentiating gives the expression for &quot;S&quot;,

:formula_104

The correction term of corresponds to the difference between the median and mean of the log-normal distribution, or equivalently for this distribution, the geometric mean and arithmetic mean, with the median (geometric mean) being lower. This is due to the AM–GM inequality, and corresponds to the logarithm being concave (or convex upwards), so the correction term can accordingly be interpreted as a convexity correction. This is an infinitesimal version of the fact that the annualized return is less than the average return, with the difference proportional to the variance. See geometric moments of the log-normal distribution for further discussion.

The same factor of appears in the &quot;d&quot;1 and &quot;d&quot;2 auxiliary variables of the Black–Scholes formula, and can be interpreted as a consequence of Itô&#x27;s lemma.

=== Doléans-Dade exponential ===
The Doléans-Dade exponential (or stochastic exponential) of a continuous semimartingale &quot;X&quot; can be defined as the solution to the SDE with initial condition . It is sometimes denoted by .
Applying Itô&#x27;s lemma with &quot;f&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;) = log(&quot;Y&quot;) gives

:formula_105

Exponentiating gives the solution

:formula_106

=== Black–Scholes formula ===

Itô&#x27;s lemma can be used to derive the Black–Scholes equation for an option. Suppose a stock price follows a geometric Brownian motion given by the stochastic differential equation . Then, if the value of an option at time is &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;, &quot;St&quot;), Itô&#x27;s lemma gives

:formula_107

The term represents the change in value in time &quot;dt&quot; of the trading strategy consisting of holding an amount of the stock. If this trading strategy is followed, and any cash held is assumed to grow at the risk free rate &quot;r&quot;, then the total value &quot;V&quot; of this portfolio satisfies the SDE

:formula_108

This strategy replicates the option if &quot;V&quot; = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;,&quot;S&quot;). Combining these equations gives the celebrated Black–Scholes equation

:formula_109

=== Product rule for Itô processes ===
Let formula_110 be a two-dimensional Ito process with SDE:
:formula_111

Then we can use the multi-dimensional form of Ito&#x27;s lemma to find an expression for formula_112.

We have formula_113 and formula_114.

We set formula_115 and observe that formula_116 and formula_117

Substituting these values in the multi-dimensional version of the lemma gives us:

:formula_118

This is a generalisation of Leibniz&#x27;s product rule to Ito processes, which are non-differentiable.

Further, using the second form of the multidimensional version above gives us

:formula_119

so we see that the product formula_120 is itself an Itô drift-diffusion process.

== Itô&#x27;s formula for functions with finite quadratic variation ==
Hans Föllmer provided a non-probabilistic proof of the Itô formula and showed that it holds for all functions with finite quadratic variation.

Let formula_121 be a real-valued function and formula_122 a right-continuous function with left limits and finite quadratic variation formula_123. Then
:formula_124

where the quadratic variation of $x$ is defined as a limit along a sequence of partitions formula_125 of formula_126 with step decreasing to zero:

formula_127

== Higher-order Itô formula==

Rama Cont and Nicholas Perkowski extended the Ito formula to functions with finite p-th variation:. For a continuous function with finite p-th variation

formula_128

the change of variable formula is:

formula_129

where the first integral is defined as a limit of compensated left Riemann sums along a sequence of partitions formula_125:

formula_131

== Infinite-dimensional formulas ==
There exist a couple of extensions to infinite-dimensional spaces (e.g. Pardoux, Gyöngy-Krylov, Brzezniak-van Neerven-Veraar-Weis).

<text>Hephaestion ( &quot;Hēphaistíōn&quot;; c. 356 BC  –  October 324 BC), son of Amyntor, was an ancient Macedonian nobleman of probable &quot;Attic or Ionian extraction&quot; and a general in the army of Alexander the Great. He was &quot;by far the dearest of all the king&#x27;s friends; he had been brought up with Alexander and shared all his secrets.&quot; This relationship lasted throughout their lives, and was compared, by others as well as themselves, to that of Achilles and Patroclus.

His military career was distinguished. A member of Alexander the Great&#x27;s personal bodyguard, he went on to command the Companion cavalry and was entrusted with many other tasks throughout Alexander&#x27;s ten-year campaign in Asia, including diplomatic missions, the bridging of major rivers, sieges and the foundation of new settlements. Besides being a soldier, engineer and diplomat, he corresponded with the philosophers Aristotle and Xenocrates and actively supported Alexander in his attempts to integrate the Greeks and Persians. Alexander formally made him his second-in-command when he appointed him Chiliarch of the empire. Alexander also made him part of the royal family when he gave him as his bride Drypetis, sister to his own second wife Stateira, both daughters of Darius III of Persia.

When Hephaestion died suddenly at Ecbatana around age thirty-two, Alexander was overwhelmed with grief. He petitioned the oracle at Siwa to grant Hephaestion divine status and thus Hephaestion was honoured as a &quot;Divine Hero&quot;. Hephaestion was cremated and his ashes taken to Babylon. At the time of his own death a mere eight months later, Alexander was still planning lasting monuments to Hephaestion&#x27;s memory.

==Youth and education==

Hephaestion&#x27;s exact age is not known. No concise biography has ever been written about him, likely stemming from the fact that he died before Alexander and none of those among Alexander&#x27;s companions who survived him would have had a need to promote someone other than themselves. Many scholars cite Hephaestion&#x27;s age as being similar to Alexander&#x27;s so it is fair to assume that he was born about 356 BC. He is said to have become a page in 343 BC, a role common to adolescent boys of the aristocratic class in Macedon. As a member of the court, he may have met Alexander around this time.

The only surviving anecdote from Hephaestion&#x27;s youth comes courtesy of the &quot;Alexander Romance&quot;. According to this tale, &quot;one day when Alexander was 15 years old ... sailing with Hephaestion, his friend, he easily reached Pisa ... and he went off to stroll with Hephaestion.&quot; That Alexander&#x27;s exact age is given provides another clue to Hephaestion&#x27;s upbringing because at fifteen Alexander and his companions were at Mieza studying under Aristotle. Hephaestion has never been named among those who attended the lectures at Mieza, but his close friendship with Alexander at that age suggests strongly that he was numbered among them. More telling is Hephaestion&#x27;s name being found in a catalogue of Aristotle&#x27;s correspondences. The letters themselves no longer exist, but for them to have found their way into an official catalogue, their content must have been of some significance. It implies that Hephaestion received a good education and shows that Aristotle was impressed enough by his alleged pupil to send letters throughout Alexander&#x27;s expanding empire to converse with him.

A few years after the lectures at Mieza, Hephaestion&#x27;s presence was notably absent when several of Alexander&#x27;s close friends were exiled as a result of the Pixodarus affair. Among those exiled by Philip II after Alexander&#x27;s failed attempt to offer himself as groom to the Carian princess were Ptolemy, Nearchus, Harpalus, Erigyius and Laomedon. The reason for Hephaestion&#x27;s absence from this list could be the fact that all of the exiled men were older friends of Alexander, Erigyius himself roughly 24 years older than the prince. Hephaestion was a contemporary of Alexander and it is likely that his influence might have been seen as less of a threat than these more mature companions. Whatever Hephaestion&#x27;s opinion had been on the whole affair, like many of Alexander&#x27;s other childhood companions he was not exiled in its aftermath.

While it is true that very little detail of Hephaestion&#x27;s childhood and education can be found, that which remains gives credence to what is known about his later life. His friendship with Alexander was long-lasting, as was his tenure in the court at Pella; he even shared the same education as the future Great King of Greece and Asia. With such a promising start, age and experience would have helped mould Hephaestion Amyntoros into the man who would one day be the second most powerful man in Alexander&#x27;s empire, second only to the king himself.

==Career==
Sharing Alexander&#x27;s upbringing, Hephaestion would have learned to fight and to ride well from an early age. His first taste of military action was probably the campaign against the Thracians while Alexander was regent, followed by Philip II&#x27;s Danube campaign (342 BC) and the battle of Chaeronea (338 BC) while he was still in his teens. His name is not mentioned in lists of high-ranking officers during the early battles of Alexander&#x27;s Danube campaign (335 BC) or the invasion of Persia. Nor are the names of Alexander&#x27;s other close friends and contemporaries listed, suggesting that their promotions, when they achieved them, were earned by merit.

===Wars in Persia===

Hephaestion&#x27;s career was never solely a military one. Right from the start he was also engaged in special missions, sometimes diplomatic, sometimes technical. The first mention of his career in the sources is a diplomatic mission of some importance. After the battle of Issus (333 BC) when Alexander was proceeding south down the Phoenician coast and had received the capitulation of Sidon, Hephaestion was &quot;authorised to appoint to the throne the Sidonian he considered most deserving of that high office&quot;. Hephaestion took local advice and chose a man distantly related to the royal family, but whose honesty had reduced him to working as a gardener. The man, Abdalonymus, had a successful royal career, fully justifying Hephaestion&#x27;s choice.

After the siege of Tyre (332 BC) Alexander entrusted his fleet to Hephaestion, who had orders to skirt the coast and head for Gaza, their next objective, while Alexander himself led the army overland. Hephaestion&#x27;s task was not an easy one for this was not the Athenian fleet with which Alexander had started and had earlier disbanded, but a motley collection of semi-reluctant allies of many nationalities who would need holding together with patience and strength. Furthermore, on arrival at Gaza the cargo of siege engines had to be unloaded, transported across difficult terrain and reassembled.

Plutarch, while writing about Alexander&#x27;s correspondence, reveals an occasion when Hephaestion was away on business and Alexander wrote to him. The subject matter suggests that this took place while they were in Egypt. What business Hephaestion was attending to we do not know, but Andrew Chugg has suggested that it was concerned either with his command of the fleet or Athenian diplomacy. He quotes sources which suggest that Hephaestion had been approached by Aristion of Athens to effect a reconciliation between Alexander and Demosthenes and, certainly, Athens&#x27; inaction during the revolt of the Spartan king Agis would seem to support this idea. As Chugg says, &quot;If he did persuade Alexander to reach an accommodation with Demosthenes at this critical juncture, as would seem likely from the circumstances, then he was significantly responsible for saving the situation for Macedon in Greece by preventing the revolt of Agis spreading to Athens and her allies.&quot;

It is likely, though not certain, that it was Hephaestion who led the advance army from Egypt to bridge the Euphrates river. Darius of Persia sent Mazaeus to hold the opposite bank while the bridging work was in progress. This Mazaeus was the commander who threw away what looked like certain victory on the Persian right at the battle of Gaugamela (331 BC) and later became Alexander&#x27;s governor of Babylon. Robin Lane Fox has suggested that a conversation with Hephaestion may have won Mazaeus over: &quot;It is conceivable that the battle of Gaugamela was partly won on the banks of the Euphrates and that Mazaeus&#x27; reinstatement was less a sign of magnanimity than of a prearranged reward.&quot;

It is at Gaugamela that mention is first made of Hephaestion&#x27;s rank. He is called the &quot;commander of the bodyguards (somatophylakes)&quot;. This is not the Royal Squadron, whose duties also included guarding the king in battle and which was at that time commanded by Cleitus—a man of the older generation—but a small group of close companions specifically designated to fight alongside the king. Hephaestion was certainly in the thick of things with Alexander for Arrian tells us he was wounded and Curtius specifically mentions that it was a spear wound in the arm.

After Gaugamela there is the first indication that Alexander intended reconciliation with the Persians and that Hephaestion supported him in this unpopular policy. One evening in Babylon Alexander noticed a high-born woman obliged to dance as part of the entertainment. Curtius explains:
&quot;The following day, he (Alexander) instructed Hephaestion to have all the prisoners brought to the royal quarters and there he verified the lineage of each of them.&quot;
Alexander had realized that people from noble families were being treated with little dignity and wanted to do something about it. That he chose Hephaestion to help him shows that he could rely on Hephaestion&#x27;s tact and sympathy. Yet Alexander could also rely on Hephaestion for firmness and resolve. When his policies had led to a plot against his life, the possible involvement of a senior officer, Philotas, caused much concern. It was Hephaestion, along with Craterus and Coenus, who insisted on, and actually carried out, the customary torture.

After the execution of Philotas (330 BC), Hephaestion was appointed joint commander—with Cleitus—of the Companion cavalry, Philotas&#x27; former position. This dual appointment was a way of satisfying two divergent shades of opinion now hardening throughout the army: one, like Hephaestion, broadly supportive of Alexander&#x27;s policy of integration, and the other, that of Philip&#x27;s older veterans in particular, whose implacable resentment of Persian ways was well represented by Cleitus. The cavalry prospered under this command, showing itself equal to learning new tactics necessary against Scythian nomads and to counter-insurgency measures such as those deployed in the spring of 328 BC. The army set out from Balkh in five columns to spread through the valleys between the Oxus and Tanais rivers to pacify Sogdiana. Hephaestion commanded one of the columns and, after arriving at Marakanda, he set out again to establish settlements in the region.

===Expedition into India===

In spring 327 BC the army headed into India and Alexander divided his forces. He led his section north into the Swat Valley, while Hephaestion and Perdiccas took a sizeable contingent through the Khyber Pass. Hephaestion&#x27;s orders were to &quot;take over either by force or agreement all places on their march and upon reaching the Indus to make suitable preparations for crossing&quot;. They were in unknown territory, whose political and geographical landscapes were unfamiliar, and Hephaestion would have had to make decisions on the spot and act accordingly. He reached the Indus with the land behind him conquered, including the successful siege of Peuceolatis, which took thirty days, and proceeded to organize the construction of boats for the crossing.

Alexander often had to divide his forces and command was given to a variety of senior officers on different occasions. For example, a few weeks before this mission of Hephaestion&#x27;s, Craterus had been sent with a large force to subdue the last two remaining Bactrian rebels. It seems that Hephaestion was chosen when the objectives were far from clear-cut, and Alexander needed a commander on whom he could rely to do what he would have done himself without needing instructions.

Hephaestion took part in a notable cavalry charge at the battle of the Hydaspes river (326 BC). Then when the army began its homeward journey he was again entrusted with half the army, including the elite troops and two hundred elephants, as they travelled south-west along the banks of the Hydaspes. Some of the army, including Alexander himself, travelled in boats which had been provided by the sponsorship of leading courtiers. Arrian lists Hephaestion first among these &quot;honorary trierarchs&quot;, indicating his leading position at this time. On entering hostile territory Alexander split his forces into three. Hephaestion&#x27;s section marched &quot;five days in advance, with the object of intercepting and capturing any native troops which ... might be rapidly moving forward&quot;. Again, Hephaestion was called upon when initiative was required. After Alexander had taken a detour to subdue a hostile tribe, in which he was seriously injured, Hephaestion took command of the greater part of the army as they travelled down the Indus to the sea. At the coast he organized the construction of a fortress and a harbour for the fleet at Pattala.

Hephaestion was in command at Pattala while Alexander advanced. When he rejoined Alexander at Rhambacia he established a city there also. Hephaestion crossed the Gedrosian desert with Alexander, sharing the torments of that journey and, when the army was safely back in Susa, he was decorated for bravery. He was to take part in no further fighting; he had only months to live. But, having ended his military career as Alexander&#x27;s de facto second-in-command, he was also his second in the political sphere. Alexander had made that official by naming him Chiliarch. Photius mentions Perdiccas being appointed &quot;to command the chiliarchy which Hephaestion had originally held&quot;.

==Relationships==
===Alexander===
Little is known of Hephaestion&#x27;s personal relationships beyond his close friendship with Alexander. Alexander was an outgoing, charismatic man who had many friends but his dearest and closest friend and confidant was Hephaestion. Theirs was a friendship which had been forged in boyhood. It endured through adolescence, through Alexander&#x27;s becoming king, and through the hardships of campaigning and the flatteries of court life and their marriages.

Their tutor Aristotle described friendship in general as &quot;one soul abiding in two bodies&quot;. That they themselves considered their friendship to be of such a kind is shown by the stories of the morning after the Battle of Issus. Diodorus, Arrian and Curtius all describe the scene—perhaps a legend— when Alexander and Hephaestion went together to visit the captured Persian royal family. Its senior member, the queen Sisygambis, knelt to Hephaestion to plead for their lives, having mistaken him for Alexander because he was taller, and both young men were wearing similar clothes. When she realized her mistake she was acutely embarrassed, but Alexander pardoned her, saying &quot;You were not mistaken, Mother; this man too is Alexander.&quot; Their affection for each other was no secret, as is borne out by their own words. Hephaestion, when replying to a letter to Alexander&#x27;s mother, Olympias, said &quot;you know that Alexander means more to us than anything&quot;. Arrian says that Alexander, after Hephaestion&#x27;s death, described him as &quot;the friend I valued as my own life&quot;. Paul Cartledge describes their closeness when he says: &quot;Alexander seems actually to have referred to Hephaestion as his alter ego.&quot;
Aside from their strong personal bond, theirs was also a working partnership in that all that Alexander undertook, Hephaestion was at his side. It is possible to discern a pattern, when studying Hephaestion&#x27;s career, of Alexander&#x27;s constant trust in, and increasing reliance on, Hephaestion. By the time of the advance into India, after the deaths of senior generals from the older generation, there had been worrying instances among senior officers of their own generation of treachery, a lack of sympathy with Alexander&#x27;s aims of further integration of Persians into the army, and of sheer incompetence. Time after time, when Alexander needed to divide his forces he entrusted half to Hephaestion, knowing that in him he had a man of unquestionable loyalty who understood and sympathized with his aims and, above all, who got the job done.

Hephaestion played a full part in Alexander&#x27;s regular consultations with senior officers, but he was the one to whom Alexander would also talk in private, sharing his thoughts, hopes, and plans. Curtius states that Hephaestion was the sharer of all his secrets; and Plutarch describes an occasion when Alexander had a controversial change to impose and implies that Hephaestion was the one with whom Alexander discussed it and who arranged for the change to be implemented. According to the painting done by Aetion of Alexander&#x27;s first wedding, Hephaestion was his torch-bearer (best man), showing by this not only his friendship, but also his support for Alexander&#x27;s policies as Alexander&#x27;s choice of an Asian bride had not been a popular one among the Macedonians.

By the time they returned to Persia, Hephaestion was officially, by title, Alexander&#x27;s second-in-command, as he had long been in practice, and also his brother-in-law (their wives were sisters). Hammond sums up their public relationship as follows: &quot;It is not surprising that Alexander was as closely attached to Hephaestion as Achilles was to Patroclus&quot;, and &quot;At the time of his death Hephaestion held the highest single command, that of the Companion Cavalry; and had been repeatedly second in command to Alexander in the hierarchy of the Asian court, holding the title of Chiliarch, which had been held by Nabarzanes under Darius. Thus Alexander honoured Hephaestion both as the closest of his friends and the most distinguished of his Field Marshals.&quot;

It has been suggested by some modern scholars that as well as being close friends Alexander and Hephaestion were also lovers, though hardly any &quot;of Alexander&#x27;s extant ancient Greek or Roman biographers ever refers to Hephaestion as anything but Alexander&#x27;s friend&quot;, conforming with Hephaestion&#x27;s epithet &quot;Philalexandros&quot; which was given to him by Alexander himself. It has been observed, however, that the ancient Greek word &quot;&quot; (philos), besides meaning &quot;friend&quot;, was also applied to lovers in the homo-erotic or sexual sense.

Furthermore, Arrian and Plutarch describe the occasion when Alexander and Hephaestion publicly identified themselves with the Homeric figures of Achilles and Patroclus. At the onset of the campaign in Asia, Alexander led a contingent of the army to visit Troy, scene of the events in his beloved &quot;Iliad&quot;. He encircled the tomb of Achilles with a garland and Hephaestion did the same with the tomb of Patroclus, and they ran a race, naked, to honour their dead heroes. Arrian and Plutarch draw no conclusions from this; however, according to Thomas R. Martin and Christopher W. Blackwell, by no means does the identification of Alexander and Hephaestion with Achilles and Patroclus equate to their being in a homosexual relationship as Homer, author of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, never suggested that Achilles and Patroclus had sexual relations. Martin and Blackwell further suggest this concept was theorized by unspecified &quot;later authors&quot;, who include, however, such eminent writers as Aeschylus and Plato that had lived before Alexander and Hephaestion&#x27;s time. Attic orator Aeschines, who was contemporary with them (albeit somewhat older), explicitly addressed the question in these terms: &quot;...Homer, though he often speaks of Patroclus and Achilles, is silent about love and gives no name to their friendship; he thinks that the remarkable strength of their affection is obvious to the cultivated among his audience.&quot; Thus, according to Robin Lane Fox quite different conclusions can be drawn from Martin and Blackwell&#x27;s:

&quot;It was a remarkable tribute, uniquely paid, and it is also Hephaestion&#x27;s first mention in Alexander&#x27;s career. Already the two were intimate, Patroclus and Achilles even to those around them; the comparison would remain to the end of their days and is proof of their life as lovers, for by Alexander&#x27;s time, Achilles and Patroclus were agreed to have enjoyed the relationship which Homer himself had never directly mentioned.&quot;

Thomas R. Martin and Christopher W. Blackwell claim &quot;homosexual affairs&quot; in the time of Alexander and Hephaestion were seen as &quot;abnormal&quot; by majority Greek standards of their time. But Andrew Chugg, Robin Lane Fox, Paul Cartledge, and others show very different views. According to Eva Cantarella, male bisexuality was widely permitted and ruled by law, and generally not frowned upon by the public to the extent to which it remained within the preset limits. For the Greeks &quot;homosexuality was not an exclusive choice. Loving another man was not an option out of the norm, different, somehow deviant. It was just a part of life experience; it was the show of an either sentimental or sexual drive that, over a lifetime, alternated and was associated (sometimes at the very same time) with love for a woman&quot;. The pattern that same-sex love affairs followed, however, was not the same in every city-state.

The assumption has persisted to the present day, with writers of fiction such as Mary Renault and the film director Oliver Stone among its proponents, as well as modern historians such as Paul Cartledge, who says: &quot;Rumour had it – and rumour was for once surely correct – that he [Hephaestion] and Alexander had once been more than just good friends.&quot; Cartledge further writes that any attempt to &quot;expunge all trace, or taint, of homosexuality&quot; from Alexander and Hephaestion&#x27;s relationship are &quot;seriously misguided.&quot; Moreover, he notes that there was no stigma attached to homoerotic attachments in ancient Greece, and &quot;almost certainly&quot; Alexander and Hephaestion&#x27;s love was physically expressed at one or more stages in their lives. But, he notes, if Hephaestion was Alexander&#x27;s &quot;catamite&quot;, the stigma attached to being the passive sexual partner is not something that Hephaestion would have wished to boast about.

However, what was the case in Athens was not necessarily the case in Macedon. As Robin Lane Fox says, &quot;descendants of the Dorians were considered and even expected to be openly homosexual, especially among their ruling class, and the Macedonian kings had long insisted on their pure Dorian ancestry&quot;. This was no fashionable affectation; this was something that belonged at the heart of what it was to be Dorian, and therefore Macedonian, and had more in common with the Theban Sacred Band than with Athens. Lucian, writing in his book &quot;On Slips of the Tongue&quot;, describes an occasion when Hephaestion&#x27;s conversation one morning implied that he had been in Alexander&#x27;s tent all night, and Plutarch describes the intimacy between them when he tells how Hephaestion was in the habit of reading Alexander&#x27;s letters with him, and of a time when he showed that the contents of a letter were to be kept secret by touching his ring to Hephaestion&#x27;s lips. There also exists a letter, spuriously attributed to Diogenes of Sinope, heavily hinting at Alexander&#x27;s yielding to &quot;Hephaestion&#x27;s thighs&quot;.

No other circumstance shows better the nature and length of their relationship than Alexander&#x27;s overwhelming grief at Hephaestion&#x27;s death. As Andrew Chugg says, &quot;it is surely incredible that Alexander&#x27;s reaction to Hephaestion&#x27;s death could indicate anything other than the closest relationship imaginable&quot;. The many and varied ways, both spontaneous and planned, by which Alexander poured out his grief are detailed below. In the context of the nature of their relationship however, one stands out as remarkable. Arrian says that Alexander &quot;flung himself on the body of his friend and lay there nearly all day long in tears, and refused to be parted from him until he was dragged away by force by his Companions&quot;.

===Others===

Among Alexander&#x27;s other officers, it is possible that Hephaestion was closest to Perdiccas, because it was with Perdiccas that he went on the mission to take Peuceolatis and bridge the Indus. By that time, as Alexander&#x27;s effective second-in-command, he could doubtless have chosen any officer he cared to name. They accomplished everything they set out to do with great success, which indicates that the two of them worked well together, and that Hephaestion found the irrepressible Perdiccas a congenial companion. It is notable that their two cavalry regiments in particular were selected by Alexander for the dangerous crossing of the river Hydaspes before the battle with the Indian king, Porus. On that occasion superb teamwork would have been of paramount importance.

However, outside the close-knit coterie of the Macedonian high command, he was not universally admired. This is clear from Arrian&#x27;s comment about Alexander&#x27;s grief: &quot;All writers have agreed that it was great, but personal prejudice, for or against both Hephaestion and Alexander himself, has coloured the accounts of how he expressed it.&quot;

Yet given the factions and jealousies that arise in any court and that Hephaestion was supremely close to the greatest monarch the Western world had yet seen, it is remarkable how little enmity he inspired. Arrian mentions a quarrel with Alexander&#x27;s secretary Eumenes but, because of a missing page in the text, the greater part of the detail is missing, leaving only the conclusion that something persuaded Hephaestion, though against his will, to make up the quarrel. However, Plutarch, who wrote about Eumenes in his series of &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, mentions that it was about lodgings and a flute-player, so perhaps this was an instance of some deeper antagonism breaking out into a quarrel over a triviality. What that antagonism might have been, it is not possible to know, but someone with the closeness to the king of a secretary might well have felt some jealousy for Hephaestion&#x27;s even greater closeness.

In only one instance is Hephaestion known to have quarrelled with a fellow officer and that was with Craterus. In this instance it is easier to see that resentment might have been felt on both sides, for Craterus was one of those officers who vehemently disliked Alexander&#x27;s policy of integrating Greek and Persian, whereas Hephaestion was very much in favour. Plutarch tells the story: &quot;For this reason a feeling of hostility grew and festered between the two and they often came into open conflict. Once on the expedition to India they actually drew their swords and came to blows ...&quot; Alexander, who also valued Craterus highly as a most competent officer, was forced to intervene and had stern words for both. It is a measure of how high feelings were running over this contentious issue that such a thing should have happened and also an indication of how closely Hephaestion identified Alexander&#x27;s wishes with his own.
Hephaestion gave perhaps the ultimate proof of this in the summer of 324 BC, when he accepted as his wife Drypetis, daughter of Darius and sister to Alexander&#x27;s own second wife Stateira. Of his short married life nothing is known, except that at the time of Alexander&#x27;s own death, eight months after Hephaestion&#x27;s, Drypetis was still mourning the husband to whom she had been married for only four months.

For Alexander to marry a daughter of Darius made good political sense, allying himself firmly with the Persian ruling class, but for Hephaestion to marry her sister shows the high esteem in which Alexander held him, bringing him into the royal family itself. They became brothers-in-law, and yet there was more to it than that. Arrian says that Alexander &quot;wanted to be uncle to Hephaestion&#x27;s children&quot;. Thus it is possible to imagine Alexander and Hephaestion hoping that their respective offspring might unite their lines and that, ultimately, the crown of Macedon and Persia might be worn by one who was a descendant of them both.

==Death and funeral==
===Death===
In spring 324 BC Hephaestion left Susa, where he had been married, and accompanied Alexander and the rest of the army as they travelled towards Ecbatana. They arrived in the autumn and it was there, during games and festivals, that Hephaestion fell ill with a fever. Arrian says that after the fever had run for seven days, Alexander had to be summoned from the games to Hephaestion, who was seriously ill. He did not arrive in time; by the time he got there, Hephaestion was dead. Plutarch says that being a young man and a soldier, Hephaestion had ignored medical advice. As soon as his doctor, Glaucias, had gone off to the theatre, he ate a large breakfast, consisting of a boiled fowl and a cooler of wine, and then fell sick and died.

Piecing the accounts together, it seems as if Hephaestion&#x27;s fever had run its course for seven days, after which time he was sufficiently recovered for his doctor, and Alexander himself, to feel it was safe to leave him, and for Hephaestion to feel hungry. His meal, however, seems to have caused a relapse that led to his rapid death. Precisely why this should have happened is not known. As Mary Renault says, &quot;This sudden crisis in a young, convalescent man is hard to account for.&quot; The explanation that fits most of the facts is that the fever was typhoid and that solid food perforated the ulcerated intestine that the typhoid would have caused. This would have led to internal bleeding, though it would be unusual in that case for death to follow quite as swiftly as it seems to have done here. For that reason, it is not possible altogether to discount other possible explanations.

Following Hephaestion&#x27;s death his body was either cremated (and the ashes later taken to Babylon) or embalmed and conveyed there, where an enormous funeral pyre was erected for him. The general Eumenes suggested that divine honors be given to Hephaestion; this was later done.

Hephaestion&#x27;s death is dealt with at greater length by the ancient sources than any of the events of his life, because of its profound effect upon Alexander. Plutarch says that &quot;Alexander&#x27;s grief was uncontrollable&quot; and adds that he ordered many signs of mourning, notably that the manes and tails of all horses should be shorn, the demolition of the battlements of the neighbouring cities and the banning of flutes and every other kind of music. Besides the account reported in a previous section about the immediate manifestations of despair by Alexander on his friend&#x27;s body, Arrian also relates that &quot;until the third day after Hephaestion&#x27;s death, Alexander neither tasted food nor paid any attention to his personal appearance, but lay on the ground either bewailing or silently mourning,&quot; and that he had the doctor, Glaucias, hanged for his lack of care. Arrian also mentions Alexander ordering the shrine of Asclepios in Ecbatana to be razed to the ground, and that he cut his hair short in mourning, this last a poignant reminder of Achilles&#x27; last gift to Patroclus on his funeral pyre:
: &quot;Thus o&#x27;er Patroclus while the hero prayed,&quot;
: &quot;on his cold hand the sacred lock he laid.&quot;
: &quot;Once more afresh the Grecian sorrows flow:&quot;
: &quot;And now the sun had set upon their woe.&quot;

Another hint that Alexander looked to Achilles to help him to express his grief may be found in the campaign, shortly following these events, against a tribe called the Cossaeans. Plutarch says they were massacred as an offering to the spirit of Hephaestion, and it is quite possible to imagine that to Alexander this might have followed in spirit with Achilles&#x27; killing of &quot;twelve high-born youths&quot; beside Patroclus&#x27; funeral pyre.

Alexander ordered a period of mourning throughout the empire and &quot;many of the Companions, out of respect for Alexander, dedicated themselves and their arms to the dead man&quot;. The army, too, remembered him; Alexander did not appoint anyone to take Hephaestion&#x27;s place as commander of the Companion cavalry; he &quot;wished Hephaestion&#x27;s name to be preserved always in connection with it, so Hephaestion&#x27;s Regiment it continued to be called, and Hephaestion&#x27;s image continued to be carried before it&quot;.

Messengers were sent to the oracle at Siwa to ask if Amon would permit Hephaestion to be worshipped as a god. When the reply came saying he might be worshipped not as a god, but as a divine hero, Alexander was pleased and &quot;from that day forward saw that his friend was honoured with a hero&#x27;s rites&quot;. He saw to it that shrines were erected to Hephaestion&#x27;s memory, and evidence that the cult took hold can be found in a simple votary plaque now in Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki, inscribed, &quot;To the Hero Hephaestion&quot;.

===Funeral===

Hephaestion was given a magnificent funeral. Its cost is variously given in the sources as 10,000 talents or 12,000 talents, about $200,000,000 or $240,000,000 in the early 21st century&#x27;s money. Alexander himself drove the funeral carriage part of the way back to Babylon with some of the driving entrusted to Hephaestion&#x27;s friend Perdiccas. At Babylon, funeral games were held in Hephaestion&#x27;s honour. The contests ranged from literature to athletics and 3,000 competitors took part, the festival eclipsing anything that had gone before both in cost and in number of participants. Plutarch says that Alexander planned to spend ten thousand talents on the funeral and the tomb. He employed Stasicrates, &quot;as this artist was famous for his innovations, which combined an exceptional degree of magnificence, audacity and ostentation&quot;, to design the pyre for Hephaestion.

The pyre was sixty metres high, square in shape and built in stepped levels. The first level was decorated with two hundred and forty ships with golden prows, each of these adorned with armed figures with red banners filling the spaces between. On the second level were torches with snakes at the base, golden wreaths in the middle and at the top, flames surmounted by eagles. The third level showed a hunting scene, and the fourth a battle of centaurs, all done in gold. On the fifth level, also in gold, were lions and bulls, and on the sixth the arms of Macedon and Persia. The seventh and final level bore sculptures of sirens, hollowed out to conceal a choir who would sing a lament. It is possible that the pyre was not burnt, but that it was actually intended as a tomb or lasting memorial; if so, it is likely that it was never completed, as there are references to expensive, uncompleted projects at the time of Alexander&#x27;s own death.

One final tribute remained, and it is compelling in its simplicity and in what it reveals about the high esteem in which Hephaestion was held by Alexander. On the day of the funeral, he gave orders that the sacred flame in the temple should be extinguished. Normally, this was only done on the death of the Great King himself.

=== Amphipolis Tomb ===

Based on a monogram found in the Amphipolis Tomb in northern Greece, the lead archaeologist, Katerina Peristeri, claims that the whole tumulus was a funerary monument for Hephaestion, built between 325 and 300 BC.

===Hamadan Stone Lion===

The Hamadan Stone Lion is a historical monument in Hamadan, Iran. In 1968 Heinz Luschey demonstrated that the lion is a Hellenistic sculpture and that the lion monument at Chaeronea (erected in 338 BC) is comparable. His interpretation that it was built by the orders of Alexander the Great to commemorate the death of Hephaestion in 324 BC, has been adopted by Iran&#x27;s Cultural Heritage Organization

<doc id="203964" wikidata="Q2739031" url="?curid=203964" title="Shergar">
<text>Shergar (3 March 1978 – ) was an Irish-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse. After a very successful season in 1981 he was retired to the Ballymany Stud in County Kildare, Ireland. In 1983 he was stolen from the stud, and a ransom of £2 million was demanded; it was not paid, and negotiations were soon broken off by the thieves. In 1999 a supergrass, formerly in the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), stated they stole the horse. The IRA has never admitted any role in the theft.

The Aga Khan, Shergar&#x27;s owner, sent the horse for training in Britain in 1979 and 1980. Shergar began his first season of racing in September 1980 and ran two races that year, where he won one and came second in the other. In 1981 he ran in six races, winning five of them. In June that year he won the 202nd Epsom Derby by ten lengths—the longest winning margin in the race&#x27;s history. Three weeks later he won the Irish Sweeps Derby by four lengths; a month after that he won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes by four lengths. In his final race of the year he came in fourth, and the Aga Khan decided to retire him to stud in Ireland.
After Shergar&#x27;s Epsom Derby win, the Aga Khan sold 40 shares in the horse, valuing it at £10 million. Retaining six shares, he created an owners&#x27; syndicate with the remaining 34 members. Shergar was stolen from the Aga Khan&#x27;s stud farm by an armed gang on 8 February 1983. Negotiations were conducted with the thieves, but the gang broke off all communication after four days when the syndicate did not accept as true the proof provided that the horse was still alive. In 1999 Sean O&#x27;Callaghan, a former member of the IRA, published details of the theft and stated that it was an IRA operation to raise money for arms. He said that very soon after the theft, Shergar had panicked and damaged his leg, which led to him being killed by the gang. An investigation by &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; concluded that the horse was shot four days after the theft. No arrests have ever been made in relation to the theft. Shergar&#x27;s body has never been recovered or identified; it is likely that the body was buried near Aughnasheelin, near Ballinamore, County Leitrim.

In honour of Shergar, the Shergar Cup was inaugurated in 1999. His story has been made into two screen dramatisations, several books and two documentaries.
==Background and early training==
Shergar was a Thoroughbred bay colt with a white blaze, four white socks and a wall (blue) eye. He was foaled on 3 March 1978 at Sheshoon—the private stud of the Aga Khan IV—near the Curragh Racecourse in County Kildare, Ireland. Shergar was sired by Great Nephew, a British stallion whose wins included the Prix du Moulin and Prix Dollar in France in 1967. Great Nephew&#x27;s other progeny included Grundy, Mrs Penny and Tolmi. Shergar&#x27;s dam was Sharmeen, a seventh-generation descendant of Mumtaz Mahal, a horse that is described by the National Sporting Library as &quot;one of the most important broodmares of the 20th Century&quot;.
In 1978 the Aga Khan—the leader of Nizari Ismailism, philanthropist and horse owner—announced he would send some of his yearlings for training in England. For a trainer, he chose Michael Stoute, who was based at Newmarket. Stoute had a good year in 1978, and had trained the winners of the Oaks, Irish Oaks and Yorkshire Oaks with Fair Salinia, and the Gold Cup with Shangamuzo. Shergar was sent into training with Stoute in 1979, as the Aga Khan&#x27;s second year of sending horses to England.
According to Stoute and Ghislain Drion—the manager of the Aga Khan&#x27;s Irish studs—Shergar was easy to break, and had a good temperament. He responded very well to training, particularly in September 1980, when the jockey Lester Piggott rode him in the run-up to Shergar&#x27;s debut race.

==Racing career==

===1980: two-year-old season===

On 19 September 1980 Shergar ran his first race, the Kris Plate, with Piggott as his jockey. The race was open to two-year-old colts and geldings over a straight at Newbury. Listed as favourite with odds of 11–8, he kept in behind the leaders before opening up and winning by lengths. Richard Baerlein, the racing correspondent for &quot;The Observer&quot;, thought Shergar&#x27;s run was the best from a two-year-old that season. After the race Stoute said the horse would run one more race that year to gain experience, before resting until the following year.
Shergar&#x27;s second race was the William Hill Futurity Stakes at Doncaster, run on 25 October 1980. He was again ridden by Piggott, with odds of 5–2 in a very experienced field of seven. Shergar sat behind the pace-setting leader for much of the race; when that horse faded, the running was taken up by Beldale Flutter. Shergar challenged for the lead, but Beldale Flutter pulled away and won by lengths; Shergar came in second. After the race, Michael Seely, the racing correspondent of &quot;The Times&quot;, thought Shergar&#x27;s run was significant, and that he was &quot;a magnificent stamp of a horse&quot;, whose odds of 25–1 for the next year&#x27;s Derby were worth considering.

===1981: three-year-old season===
In late 1980 and early 1981, Shergar filled out; by April he was stronger. Stoute had decided that Shergar should run in that year&#x27;s Derby, and planned the season accordingly. The first race to prepare him was the Guardian Newspaper Classic Trial, run at Sandown on 25 April 1981, where he was ridden by Walter Swinburn. In a 9-horse, -mile (2.0 km) race, Shergar raised his pace after a mile and won by 10 lengths. Baerlein had written in his column before the race that at 25–1, the odds for Shergar to win the Derby were excellent. After the win, he noted them shortening to 8–1, where, &quot;the bet is still worth pressing&quot;; he continued &quot;If ... [Shergar] wins his next race at Chester or the Ladbroke Lingfield Trial as easily, he will be down to less than 4–1. Surely this is the time to bet like men.&quot;
As further training for the Derby, Stoute decided that Shergar needed practice on a left-hand cornered course; he selected Chester, where the Chester Vase was run on 5 May 1981. After keeping pace with the leaders, with half a mile to go, Swinburn urged Shergar to increase speed, and he did, overtaking the leaders and going clear to win by 12 lengths.

On 3 June 1981 Shergar ran in the Derby. Set over a  mile (2.4 km) course at the Epsom Downs Racecourse in Surrey, the Derby is a Group 1 flat race open to three-year-old Thoroughbred colts and fillies. After the top of the uphill straight start of the course, Shergar was well-placed and moving through the other runners. At Tattenham Corner—the final bend of the course—Shergar took the front of the race and opened up a lead over the others. Commentating on the race, Peter Bromley informed listeners that &quot;there&#x27;s only one horse in it—you need a telescope to see the rest!&quot; Swinburn eased off the pace with two furlongs to go, and won by ten lengths. It was the largest winning margin of any Epsom Derby. John Matthias, the jockey of the second-placed horse Glint of Gold, said that &quot;I thought I&#x27;d achieved my life&#x27;s ambition. Only then did I discover there was another horse on the horizon.&quot; In the light of Shergar&#x27;s run of wins, particularly the Derby, Baerlein wrote that the horse was one of the finest he had seen.
While out on the gallops on 15 June, Shergar threw his rider, ran through a hedge onto the road and trotted along to the local village. He was spotted by a local resident, who followed the horse until it stopped to graze on a hedge, and then led him back to the stables. Shergar was unharmed during the event, and Stoute recalled &quot;it&#x27;s very lucky nothing happened to him; there&#x27;s a crossing there, and it&#x27;s a difficult thing&quot;.
By the time the Irish Derby was run at the Curragh, on 27 June 1981, Swinburn was suspended following an infringement at Royal Ascot, so Piggott returned to ride Shergar. At the half-way point in the race, Shergar was in third place, but increased his pace to take the lead with three furlongs to go. He slowed during the last furlong, and won by four lengths. As the horse approached the line, Michael O&#x27;Hehir, the commentator, informed viewers that &quot;He&#x27;s winning it so easily; it&#x27;s Shergar first and the rest are nowhere&quot;. After the race Piggott told reporters that he had no doubt that Shergar would win as the horse never struggled in the race. He also said that Shergar was one of the best horses he had ever raced on.

Following Shergar&#x27;s Epsom Derby win, a group of US horse owners had offered $40 million to syndicate the horse. The Aga Khan turned down the offer, and instead decided to syndicate Shergar for £10 million at £250,000 for each of the forty shares—a record price at the time; the Aga Khan kept six shares for himself and the others were sold individually to buyers from nine countries. The shareholders had the option each year of selecting a mare to be covered—or of selling that option on. The stud fees were £60,000–80,000 per cover, which meant that shareholders could expect to make a profit from stud within four years.
Shergar had a break of almost a month until he ran in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot on 25 July 1981. The race was slow-paced to start and Shergar was boxed in by other horses, but found a way out by the time the leaders had reached the final straight, and accelerated to win by four lengths. For Baerlein, the race showed that Shergar was the best horse he had ever seen race; Michael Phillips, the racing correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot;, wrote that the win &quot;proved that Shergar is a cut above the average but not exceptional&quot;. Phillips continued that Shergar &quot;failed to fill me, and many more besides, with the magic that was in the air after Nijinsky and Mill Reef had won the same race&quot;.
The Aga Khan and Stoute considered entering Shergar into the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe that autumn, but decided that he needed one more race to prepare. They entered him into what would be his final race, the St Leger Stakes at Doncaster on 12 September 1981, with Swinburn as the jockey. Ten days before the race, a story was published in the racing newspaper &quot;Sporting Life&quot; that Shergar had not been practising well and had become &quot;mulish&quot;; Stoute stated that the rumours were untrue. Shergar was running well in the race, although the soft ground was not to his liking, but on the final straight, when Swinburn tried to get him to accelerate to the front, the horse would not respond. Shergar came in fourth, lengths behind Cut Above, the winner.
Surprised by the manner of the loss, Stoute and the Aga Khan ran a series of tests on Shergar. All showed the horse was in good health, and he worked well in training after the race. Unwilling to risk the horse without knowing what had happened at the St Leger, the Aga Khan did not enter him into the Arc, and instead retired him to the Ballymany Stud, near the Curragh. He later explained to a racing journalist:
He was just an exceptional athlete. All through the spring and summer he completely dominated European racing in a very dramatic manner, and after he had run so uncharacteristically in the St. Leger, we knew something had gone wrong, but we didn&#x27;t know what it was, so it was an easy decision to retire him before the Arc.

==Stud career==
The Aga Khan turned down large offers to put Shergar to stud in the US, and instead chose to stand him at the Ballymany Stud in Ireland. He arrived in October 1981, and was paraded down the main street of Newbridge, County Kildare. Milton Toby, the writer on Thoroughbred racing and equine law, judges Shergar to have been &quot;a national hero in Ireland. ... one of the most recognizable sports personalities—horse or human—in Ireland.&quot;
In 1982—his only rutting season—Shergar covered 44 mares, from which 36 foals were produced: 17 colts and 19 fillies. Of these, three won Group races, and the most successful of his progeny was Authaal. When sold as a weanling (between six months and a year) Authaal reached 325,000 guineas. He was sold a year later, where he fetched 3.1 million guineas. In 1986 he won the Irish St. Leger by five lengths. Toby considers that Shergar&#x27;s progeny were &quot;perhaps not a disappointing first crop, but certainly below expectations for a horse with Shergar&#x27;s racing prowess.&quot;
At the start of February 1983 Shergar&#x27;s second stud season was about to begin, and he was in high demand, and had a full book of 55 mares to cover. He was expected to earn £1 million for the season.

==February 1983 onwards==
===Theft===

On 8 February 1983, at around 8:30 pm, three men—all armed and wearing masks—entered the house of Jim Fitzgerald, the head groom at Ballymany. They were part of a group of at least six, and possibly up to nine men. One of the men said to him &quot;We have come for Shergar. We want £2 million for him.&quot; Fitzgerald said the men were not rough, although one of them who carried a pistol was very aggressive. Fitzgerald&#x27;s family were locked into a room while he was taken, at gunpoint, out to Shergar&#x27;s stable and was told to put the horse in the back of a horsebox.
After the horsebox was driven away Fitzgerald was told to lie on the floor of a van, and his face was covered with a coat. He was driven around for four hours before being released near the village of Kilcock, approximately from Ballymany. He was told not to contact the Garda Síochána (Gardaí)—the Irish police—or he and his family would be killed, but to wait for the gang to contact him. He was given the code phrase &quot;King Neptune&quot;, which the gang would use to identify themselves. The men did not say that they were from the IRA, or give any other indication as to who they were, although one of the men spoke with a Northern Irish accent, and another seemed to be experienced with horses.
Fitzgerald walked on to the next village and called his brother to pick him up. On arrival back at Ballymany, he rang Ghislain Drion to inform him of the theft, and urged him not to call the police because of the threats that had been made. Drion attempted to reach the Aga Khan in Switzerland to inform him, then rang Stan Cosgrove, Shergar&#x27;s vet, who was also a shareholder. Cosgrove contacted a retired Irish Army captain, Sean Berry, who was manager of the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association. Berry contacted Alan Dukes, a friend of his who was the serving Minister for Finance, who suggested that Berry speak to Michael Noonan, the Minister for Justice. Noonan and Dukes told him to call the Gardaí. By 4:00 am Drion had managed to contact the Aga Khan, who told him to phone the Gardaí straight away. The force were then contacted, but it was eight hours after Shergar had been stolen and any possible trail had already gone cold.
The Aga Khan had several reasons for non-payment of the ransom, including that he was only one of 35 members, and could not negotiate or pay on behalf of the others. He was unsure whether Shergar would be returned even if the money was paid, and concerned that, if the kidnappers&#x27; demands were met, it would make every high-value horse in Ireland a target for future thefts. The shareholders were divided on the approach. Brian Sweeney, a veteran of the American horseracing industry thought that &quot;if you ask a mother who has had a child that has been kidnapped if a ransom should be paid, I think the answer would be &#x27;yes, and quickly&#x27;&quot;; another shareholder, Lord Derby, disagreed and said &quot;if ransom money is paid for this horse, then there is a danger of other horses being kidnapped in the years to come—and that simply cannot be tolerated&quot;.

===First approach by the thieves===

The first phone call from the thieves was on the night Shergar was stolen; Fitzgerald was not back at Ballymany by that time, and had not had the chance to tell the news of the theft to anyone. The call was to Jeremy Maxwell, a horse trainer based in Northern Ireland. The caller demanded £40,000, although this figure was later raised to £52,000. Maxwell was told that the negotiations would only be with three British horse racing journalists, Derek Thompson and John Oaksey of ITV and Peter Campling from &quot;The Sun&quot;. The men were told to be at the Europa Hotel in central Belfast by the Thursday evening; the Europa was known as the most bombed hotel in Europe after having suffered multiple bomb attacks during the Troubles.
When the three sports journalists arrived at the Europa, they were contacted by phone and told to go to the Maxwells&#x27; house to await further calls. On orders from the police, Thompson kept the person talking for as long as possible, but the caller rang off at 80 seconds—before the call could be traced. There were a series of calls to the Maxwells&#x27; house later that night, and at 1:30 am Thompson managed to keep the caller talking for over 90 seconds, which would have been enough to trace the call; he was told that the person who was doing the call intercepts had finished his shift at midnight and gone home. At 7:00 am on 12 February another call was put through to the Maxwells&#x27; house, which said that things had gone wrong, and that Shergar was dead.
Although a committee put together by the syndicate to co-ordinate their response later considered that this was a hoax, Toby argues that as the call about the theft preceded Fitzgerald&#x27;s return to Ballymany—i.e. before anyone knew about the theft—and as the callers used the code phrase &quot;King Neptune&quot; in their communications, it is more likely that the calls, and the ensuing focus on the high-profile activity in Belfast, were undertaken to distract the authorities from what was happening with Shergar elsewhere.

===Second approach by the thieves===
On 9 February the thieves opened a second line of negotiation, contacting Ballymany Stud directly and speaking to Drion. The call, which came in at 4:05 pm, was short. Drion was not a fluent speaker of English and struggled to understand the Irish accent of the caller; the caller similarly had problems with Drion&#x27;s heavy French pronunciation. Ninety minutes later, the caller tried again, with Drion asking him to speak slowly. A demand of £2 million was made for the return of Shergar, and for a contact number in France, through which further negotiations could be made. Drion provided the number of the Aga Khan&#x27;s French office.

The syndicate which owned Shergar brought in the risk and strategic consulting firm Control Risks to handle the negotiations. They negotiated from the Paris office, with a series of telephone calls over four days. On Friday 11 February the negotiators demanded proof that Shergar was still alive, as there had been some speculation in the press that Shergar was dead. The thieves said that a representative of the syndicate should go to the Crofton Hotel in Dublin and ask for any messages for &quot;Johnny Logan&quot;—the name of an Irish singer. Stan Cosgrove went to the hotel and asked for any messages. Armed members of the Special Detective Unit—the domestic security agency of the Gardaí—were present in an undercover role. No message was delivered, and Cosgrove returned home after waiting. Shortly afterwards the negotiators received a phone call from the thieves, angry at the presence of the police, and threatening that if any members of the gang were captured or killed, the negotiators and police would be murdered in retribution.
On Saturday 12 February the thieves contacted the negotiators and said that proof had been left at the Rosnaree Hotel. When this was picked up, it contained several polaroid pictures showing Shergar; some of the pictures showed the horse&#x27;s head next to a copy of &quot;The Irish News&quot;, dated 11 February. Cosgrove saw the photograph and confirmed that &quot;it definitely was him&quot;, although he added &quot;It wasn&#x27;t proof that the horse was alive ... at that point ... you&#x27;d want to get much more definite evidence ... if you&#x27;d have seen the complete horse it would have been different, but this was just the head.&quot;
In a telephone call from the thieves to the negotiators at 10:40 pm on 12 February, it was explained that the syndicate were not satisfied with the pictures of the horse, which, they explained, did not constitute enough proof. The caller told the negotiators &quot;If you&#x27;re not satisfied, that&#x27;s it&quot;. The call was ended, and the thieves never made any further contact. The syndicate attempted to re-establish contact with the gang, but there was no response to newspaper requests to do so.

====Negotiations examined====
The syndicate committee put together a report for the full syndicate, which examined the possible motives behind the theft. They concluded that the theft of Shergar was either undertaken to create confusion and publicity, rather than obtaining money, or that the negotiations were undertaken with naivety. They reached this conclusion after taking a number of factors into account. Many of the demands were physically impossible: the ransom demand included £100 sterling notes, which did not exist. In one call at 5:45 pm to Drion in Ballymany, he was told to deliver the £2 million to Paris before noon the following day. In a call at 5:00 pm, the Paris negotiators were told to get £2 million by the end of the night—after the Parisian banks had closed. In another call, the negotiator in Paris was told to get agreement for a ransom, but told he should not contact anyone in Ireland, despite some of the shareholders being there. It also became clear during the course of the negotiations that the gang thought that the Aga Khan was the sole owner of Shergar; they had no knowledge of the other shareholders, and did not take into account the complexity of liaising and organising all 35 shareholders into a position of agreement.

===Police investigation===
The initial police investigation was hindered by the eight-hour lapse before the crime was reported, and by a local Thoroughbred auction, which meant several horseboxes were travelling in the area. Leading the investigation was Chief Superintendent James Murphy, a highly experienced detective. In his first press conference Murphy described how he was &quot;slightly concerned&quot; about the theft, and told reporters that &quot;I have no leads&quot;. His comment about a lack of leads was not truthful, as Murphy withheld much information from the media, including the police finding the magazine for a Steyr MPi 69 submachine gun, which suggested a link to an IRA active service unit in South Armagh.
Murphy had a strong Irish brogue, wore a trilby hat and had a self-effacing sense of humour. At one press conference, he announced &quot;A clue? That is something we haven&#x27;t got&quot;. Several people claiming to have paranormal powers contacted the Gardaí with their thoughts; Murphy reported that &quot;diviners, clairvoyants and psychic persons—they&#x27;re in three different categories—they must be running into the fifties now&quot;. During one press conference, six photographers turned up wearing similar trilbies to the policeman; &quot;The Times&quot; called him a &quot;stage Irishman&quot;. One reviewer of a documentary in 2004 called Murphy &quot;the most richly comic copper since Inspector Clouseau&quot;. After eight days with no progress, he was replaced as the public figure of the investigation, but continued to lead it.
On 16 February a description of the horsebox used by the thieves—from a description given by Fitzgerald—was released. It was either light green or light blue with no working lights and no licence plates. The huge police search of possible hiding places for Shergar—by the Gardaí in the Irish Republic and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in Northern Ireland—found no trace of the horse or horsebox, but several IRA caches of arms and explosives were uncovered, leading to the loss of several safe houses. Up to 70 detectives were working on the case at one point. Two weeks after Shergar was stolen, the police search was scaled down, although the investigation continued.

===Speculation and hoaxes===
With no definite news of Shergar&#x27;s whereabouts, and with the Gardaí limiting the information they released to the press, the media took to speculation to cover the story. Baerlein observes that in reporting the Shergar case, &quot;the press speculation was remarkable for its enthusiasm and its inaccuracy over a long period of time&quot;. Such media claims included that Shergar had been stolen by Colonel Gaddafi as part of a deal to supply arms to the IRA; that, according to the tabloid newspaper &quot;Sunday Sport&quot;, Shergar was spotted being ridden by the missing Lord Lucan; that a Middle Eastern horse breeder had stolen him for stud; and that the Mafia had undertaken the act to punish the Aga Khan over a previous sale of a horse which had gone badly.
Eight weeks after Shergar was stolen, Stan Cosgrove was approached by senior detectives within the Gardaí who introduced him to Dennis Minogue, a horse trainer. Minogue claimed to have a contact within the IRA who had shown him a photograph of Shergar, and that he could help get Shergar released for a ransom of IR£80,000. The Gardaí asked Cosgrove to assist them in a sting operation to lure the thieves out. Cosgrove agreed, and on 20 July 1983 Detective Garda Martin Kenirons assisted the operation. He put the money in the boot of his car in a remote village, which Minogue was to collect once the horse had been released. The following day Kenirons found the boot of his car forced open and the money missing. Minogue had also disappeared, and the money was never recovered.
A subsequent internal Gardaí enquiry dismissed Kenirons from the force for breaching Gardaí regulations. In an interview in 2018 he reiterated his long-stated innocence and said &quot;when it all went wrong, everyone jumped for the high ground. They [the senior Gardaí officers] all denied that they had anything to do with the ransom.&quot;

===Insurance===
Shergar was insured through several insurance companies. The Lloyd&#x27;s of London insurance brokers Hodgson McCreedy covered £3,625,000 of the total, and added a theft clause to the policy. Other shareholders—accountable for £1.5 million worth of shares—had insurance that did not include a theft clause; Cosgrove was one of the mortality-only insured members. Shareholders accounting for £3 million did not take out insurance; the Aga Khan was one of the uninsured members of the syndicate. Cosgrove was insured with Norwich Union (now part of Aviva), who refused to pay, even when it became clear that Shergar was probably dead; the company&#x27;s liability was £144,000.
The 20 policies that included a theft clause were all settled in full in June 1983, even though there was a question of whether there was a need to. Terry Hall, an animal insurance insurer with Lloyd&#x27;s of London, observes that while theft was clear cut, the demand of a ransom meant that the action was considered extortion, rather than theft, which meant the mortality and theft policies did not have to be paid out. Legal advice was sought by Lloyd&#x27;s of London, who were told that although it was a grey area, payment was advised.

==Possible identification of the criminals==
Police and intelligence sources considered the IRA as the most likely suspects behind the theft. During the 1980s, the Irish republican movement followed the Armalite and ballot box strategy, in which electoral success was chased by Sinn Féin, while an armed struggle was continued by the IRA. The strategy was expensive, requiring payment for arms and explosives for the IRA, and for political activity, advertising and salaries for Sinn Féin. The annual budget for the movement was estimated at between £2 million and £5 million, and it was always under financial pressure.
In October 1981 the IRA Army Council—the leadership group of the organisation—approved the kidnapping of Ben Dunne, then head of the chain of Dunnes Stores. Dunne was released unharmed after a week; both the Dunne family and the Gardaí deny a ransom of £300,000 was paid. According to intelligence subsequently received by the intelligence sources, after the success of the operation, it was decided to undertake another ransom—through kidnapping or theft—this time of Shergar.
In 1999 Sean O&#x27;Callaghan, a former member of the IRA who had been working within the organisation as a supergrass for the Gardaí since 1980, published his autobiography. In it, he states that the plot to steal and ransom Shergar was devised by Kevin Mallon, a leading IRA member who sat on the Army Council; Mallon came up with the idea while serving time in Portlaoise Prison. Mallon was put in charge of a Special Operations unit with orders to raise several million pounds, and several IRA men were taken from under O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s control in IRA Southern Command and put into Mallon&#x27;s unit. These included the IRA members Gerry Fitzgerald, Paul Stewart, Rab Butler and Nicky Kehoe.
Two weeks after Shergar&#x27;s kidnap, Gerry Fitzgerald told O&#x27;Callaghan that he had been involved in the theft, and that Shergar had been killed early on in the process after the horse panicked and no-one present could cope with him. In the process the horse damaged its left leg and the decision was made to kill it. In his 1999 autobiography O&#x27;Callaghan states that Shergar &quot;was killed within days&quot; of the theft; in an interview for RTÉ, the Irish broadcaster, in 2004, he stated that Gerry Fitzgerald &quot;strongly suggested that Shergar had been killed within hours of his kidnap&quot;. The IRA then kept up a deception that the horse was still alive and in their care.
Kevin O&#x27;Connor, a journalist with RTÉ, identifies three parts of the gang: a section to undertake high-profile activity in Belfast, to focus media attention in the north; one part negotiating discreetly with the Aga Khan; and one part guarding the horse.
According to O&#x27;Callaghan, in August 1983, in an effort to raise the money that they failed to do with the Shergar theft, Fitzgerald and his group attempted to kidnap the businessman Galen Weston at his home in County Wicklow. The Gardaí had been forewarned, and took over the house while Weston was in the UK. After a gun battle, Gerry Fitzgerald, Kehoe and three others were arrested. They received long prison sentences. O&#x27;Callaghan stated that &quot;Essentially the same team that went to kidnap Shergar went to kidnap Galen Weston&quot;.
No arrests have ever been made in relation to Shergar&#x27;s theft. The IRA have never admitted any role in the theft or its aftermath. Mallon and Kehoe deny any involvement in the events. Toby raises a query over O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s story, saying the IRA informant was &quot;a confessed informer whose life depending on his ability to weave a convincing web of lies. Without more evidence, O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s story ... [is] just that, an interesting story.&quot;
In 2008 a special investigation by &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; obtained information from another IRA member who said that O&#x27;Callaghan had not been told the full story &quot;because the gang was so embarrassed by what happened&quot;: a vet that the IRA had arranged to look after Shergar did not turn up because his wife threatened to leave him if he did. Once the IRA realised that the Aga Khan was not going to pay, the Army Council ordered the horse to be released. The extensive search by the Gardaí hampered any release, and Mallon thought he was under close surveillance, and that releasing the horse was too risky, so, four days after the kidnapping, he ordered that it should be killed. The IRA source told the newspaper that two men went into the stable where Shergar was being held; one carried a machine gun:
Shergar was machine gunned to death. There was blood everywhere and the horse even slipped on his own blood. There was lots of cussin&#x27; and swearin&#x27; because the horse wouldn&#x27;t die. It was a very bloody death.

==Remains==

Shergar&#x27;s body has never been recovered or identified. Several sources, including O&#x27;Callaghan, &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot; consider it likely that the body was buried near Aughnasheelin, near Ballinamore, County Leitrim. O&#x27;Callaghan said that as far as he knew, the remains had been buried on the farm of an IRA veteran from the 1940s, and that it would be difficult to get permission to dig on the land. Ballinamore is a town of strong republicanism, once nicknamed the &quot;Falls Road of the South&quot;—a reference to the Falls Road, Belfast, a highly republican area during the Troubles.
There have been several claims of equine skeletons being that of Shergar. Des Leadon, a specialist horse vet with knowledge of equine pathology, has assisted the Gardaí in several instances where a horse&#x27;s remains may have been those of Shergar. He retains some strands of hair from Shergar&#x27;s mane and tail which, he says, may contain sufficient DNA to confirm an identification.

==Legacy==
In 1999, in honour of Shergar, the Shergar Cup was inaugurated at Goodwood Racecourse, in a format that put a European team of jockeys against one from the Middle East. The race was later moved to Ascot Racecourse and is a competition between four teams, Great Britain and Ireland, Europe, the rest of the world and an all-women team. The winners of the competition are presented with a trophy showing Shergar; this was donated by the Aga Khan.
On the twentieth anniversary of Shergar&#x27;s Derby win, a bronze statuette of the horse was presented to the winning jockey. A statue of Shergar stands in the grounds of Gilltown Stud, one of the Aga Khan&#x27;s Irish stud farms.
The story of Shergar&#x27;s theft was made into a television play with Stephen Rea and Gary Waldhorn, broadcast in March 1986 as part of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Screen Two&quot; anthology series. The play was based on the few facts known, plus a backstory described as plausible by Hugh Hebert, reviewing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;. The theft was also dramatised as the film &quot;Shergar&quot;, directed by Dennis Lewiston and starring Ian Holm and Mickey Rourke. There have been two television documentaries, &quot;Who Kidnapped Shergar?&quot;, broadcast on RTÉ in March 2004, and &quot;Searching for Shergar&quot;, broadcast on BBC One in June 2018.

<text>The Battle of Plattsburgh, also known as the Battle of Lake Champlain, ended the final British invasion of the northern states of the United States during the War of 1812. Two British forces, an army under Lieutenant General Sir George Prévost and a naval squadron under Captain George Downie converged on the lakeside town of Plattsburgh, New York. Plattsburgh was defended by New York and Vermont militia and detachments of regular troops of the United States Army, all under the command of Brigadier General Alexander Macomb, and ships commanded by Master Commandant Thomas Macdonough.

Downie&#x27;s squadron attacked shortly after dawn on 11 September 1814, but was defeated after a hard fight in which Downie was killed. Prévost then abandoned the attack by land against Macomb&#x27;s defences and retreated to Canada, stating that even if Plattsburgh was captured, any British troops there could not be supplied without control of the lake.

When the battle took place, American and British delegates were meeting at Ghent in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, attempting to negotiate a treaty acceptable to both sides to end the war. The American victory at Plattsburgh, and the successful defense at the Battle of Baltimore, which began the next day and halted British advances in the Mid-Atlantic states, denied the British negotiators leverage to demand any territorial claims against the United States on the basis of &quot;uti possidetis&quot;, i.e., retaining territory they held at the end of hostilities. The Treaty of Ghent, in which captured or occupied territories were restored on the basis of &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;, i.e., the situation as it existed before the war, was signed three months after the battle. However, this battle may have had little or no impact in advancing the objectives of either side.

==Background==

===British plans===
In 1814, most of Britain&#x27;s army was engaged in the Peninsular War in Iberia. Then in April, Napoleon I abdicated the throne of France. This provided Britain the opportunity to send 16,000 veteran troops from the Peninsula and other garrisons to North America. Several experienced Major-Generals were also detached from the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s army to command them.

The Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, the Earl of Bathurst, sent instructions to Lieutenant-General Sir George Prévost, the Commander-in-Chief in Canada and Governor General of the Canadas, authorizing him to launch offensives into American territory, but cautioning him against advancing too far and thereby risking being cut off. Bathurst suggested that Prévost should give first priority to attacking Sackett&#x27;s Harbor on Lake Ontario, where the American fleet on the lake was based, and seize control of Lake Champlain as a secondary objective. Prévost lacked the means to transport the troops necessary for an attack on Sackett&#x27;s Harbor and the supplies for them up the Saint Lawrence River. Furthermore, the American ships controlled Lake Ontario, making an attack impossible until the British launched the first-rate ship of the line HMS &quot;St. Lawrence&quot; on 15 October, too late in the year for major operations to be undertaken.

Prévost therefore prepared to launch his major offensive to Lake Champlain, up the Richelieu River. (Since the Richelieu was the only waterway connecting Lake Champlain to the ocean, trade on the lake naturally went through Canada.) Prévost&#x27;s choice of route on reaching the lake was influenced by the attitude of the American state of Vermont, on the eastern side of the lake. The state had shown itself to be less than wholeheartedly behind the war and its inhabitants readily traded with the British, supplying them with all the cattle consumed by the British army, and even military stores such as masts and spars for the British warships on Lake Champlain. To spare Vermont from becoming a seat of war, Prévost therefore determined to advance down the western, New York State, side of the lake. The main American position on this side was at Plattsburgh.

Prévost organized the troops which were to carry out the invasion into a division commanded by Major General Sir Francis de Rottenburg, the Lieutenant Governor of Lower Canada. The division consisted of the 1st Brigade of veterans of the Peninsular War under Major General Frederick Philipse Robinson (the 3/27th, 39th, 76th and 88th Regiments of Foot); the 2nd Brigade of troops already serving in Canada under Major General Thomas Brisbane (the 2/8th, 13th, and 49th Regiments of Foot, the Regiment de Meuron, the Canadian Voltigeurs, and the Canadian Chasseurs); and the 3rd Brigade of troops from the Peninsula and various garrisons under Major General Manley Power (the 3rd, 5th, 1/27th, and 58th Regiments of Foot). Each brigade was supported by a battery of five 6-pounder guns and one 5.5-inch howitzer of the Royal Artillery. A squadron of the 19th Light Dragoons was attached to the force. There was also a small &quot;siege train&quot; of artillery, consisting of two 24-pounder brass field guns, an 8-inch brass howitzer, and three 24-pounder naval carronades mounted on field carriages, and a Congreve rocket detachment. The force numbered 11,000 in total. However, some units were detached and some sick men did not take part, so the actual number of troops present at Plattsburgh was just over 8,000.

There was some tension within the force between the brigade and regimental commanders who were veterans of the Peninsular War or of earlier fighting in Upper Canada, and Prévost and his staff. Prévost had not endeared himself by complaining about the standards of dress of the troops from the Peninsular Army, where the Duke of Wellington had emphasized musketry and efficiency above turnout. Furthermore, neither Prévost, nor de Rottenburg, nor Prévost&#x27;s Adjutant General (Major General Edward Baynes) had the extensive experience of battle gained by their brigade commanders, and had already gained a reputation for caution and hesitancy. Prévost&#x27;s Quartermaster General, Major General Thomas Sydney Beckwith, was a veteran of the early part of the Peninsular campaign and of operations in Chesapeake Bay in 1813, but even he was to be criticized, mainly for failures in the intelligence.

===American defenses===
On the American side of the frontier, Major General George Izard was the commander of the Northern Army, deployed along the Northeast frontier. In late August, Secretary of War John Armstrong ordered Izard to take the majority of his force, about 4,000 troops, to reinforce Sackett&#x27;s Harbor. Izard&#x27;s force departed on 23 August, leaving Brigadier General Alexander Macomb in command at Plattsburgh with only 1,500 American regulars. Most of these troops were recruits, invalids or detachments of odds and ends.

Macomb ordered General Benjamin Mooers to call out the New York militia and appealed to the governor of Vermont for militia volunteers. 2,000 troops eventually reported to Plattsburgh under the command of Major General John Strong. Macomb put these recent volunteers to work digging trenches and building fortifications.

Macomb&#x27;s main position was a ridge on the south bank of the Saranac River. Its fortifications had been laid out by Major Joseph Gilbert Totten, Izard&#x27;s senior Engineer officer, and consisted of three redoubts and two blockhouses, linked by other fieldworks. The position was reckoned to be well enough supplied and fortified to withstand a siege for three weeks, even if the American ships on the lake were defeated and Plattsburgh was cut off. After Izard&#x27;s division departed, Macomb continued to improve his defences. He even created an invalid battery on Crab Island, where his hospital was sited, that was to be manned by sick or wounded soldiers who were at least fit to fire the cannon. The townspeople of Plattsburgh had so little faith in Macomb&#x27;s efforts to repulse the invasion that by September nearly all 3,000 inhabitants had fled the city. Plattsburgh was left occupied only by the American army.

===Naval background===
The British had gained naval superiority on Lake Champlain on 1 June 1813, when two American sloops pursued British gunboats into the Richelieu River, and were forced to surrender when the wind dropped and they were trapped by British artillery on the banks of the river. They were taken into the British naval establishment at Ile aux Noix, under Commander Daniel Pring. Their crews, and those of several gunboats, were temporarily reinforced by seamen drafted from ships of war lying at Quebec under Commander Thomas Everard who, being senior to Pring, took temporary command. They embarked 946 troops under Lieutenant Colonel John Murray of the 100th Regiment of Foot, and raided several settlements on both the New York and Vermont shores of Lake Champlain during the summer and autumn of 1813. The losses they inflicted and the restriction they imposed on the movement of men and supplies to Plattsburgh contributed to the defeat of Major General Wade Hampton&#x27;s advance against Montreal, which finally ended with the Battle of the Chateauguay.

Lieutenant Thomas Macdonough, commanding the American naval forces on the Lake, established a secure base at Otter Creek (Vermont), and constructed several gunboats. He had to compete with Commodore Isaac Chauncey, commanding on Lake Ontario, for seamen, shipwrights and supplies, and was not able to begin constructing larger fighting vessels until his second-in-command went to Washington to argue his case to the Secretary of the Navy, William Jones. Naval architect Noah Brown was sent to Otter Creek to superintend construction.

In April 1814, the Americans launched the corvette of 26 guns and the schooner of 14 guns (originally a part-completed steam vessel). Together with the existing sloop-rigged of 7 guns, they gave the Americans naval superiority, and this allowed them to establish and supply a substantial base at Plattsburgh. Only a few days before the Battle of Plattsburgh, the Americans also completed the 20-gun brig .

The loss of their former supremacy on Lake Champlain prompted the British to construct the 36-gun frigate at Ile aux Noix. Captain George Downie was appointed to command soon after the frigate was launched on 25 August, replacing Captain Peter Fisher, who in turn had superseded Pring. Like Macdonough, Downie had difficulty obtaining men and materials from the senior officer on Lake Ontario (Commodore James Lucas Yeo) and Macdonough had intercepted several spars which had been sold to Britain by unpatriotic Vermonters. (By tradition, Midshipman Joel Abbot destroyed several of these in a daring commando-type raid.) Downie could promise to complete &quot;Confiance&quot; only on 15 September, and even then the frigate&#x27;s crew would not have been exercised. Prévost was anxious to begin his campaign as early as possible, to avoid the bad weather of late autumn and winter, and continually pressed Downie to prepare &quot;Confiance&quot; for battle more quickly.

==Invasion==
On 31 August, Prévost began marching south. Macomb sent forward 450 regulars under Captain Sproul and Major John E. Wool, 110 riflemen under Major Daniel Appling, 700 New York militia under Major General Benjamin Mooers and two 6-pounder guns under Captain Leonard to fight a delaying action. At Chazy, New York, they first made contact with the British. Slowly falling back, the Americans set up road blocks, burned bridges and mislabelled streets to slow down the British. The British nevertheless advanced steadily, not even deploying out of column of march or returning fire, except by flank guards.

When Prévost reached Plattsburgh on 6 September, the American rearguards retired across the Saranac, tearing up the planks from the bridges. Prévost did not immediately attack. On 7 September, he ordered Major General Robinson to cross the Saranac, but to Robinson&#x27;s annoyance, Prévost had no intelligence on the American defences or even the local geography. Some tentative attacks across the bridges were repulsed by Wool&#x27;s regulars.

Prévost abandoned his efforts to cross the river for the time being and instead began constructing batteries. The Americans responded by using cannonballs heated red-hot to set fire to sixteen buildings in Plattsburgh which the British were using as cover, forcing the British to withdraw farther away. On 9 September, a night raid across the Saranac River by 50 Americans led by Captain George McGlassin destroyed a British Congreve rocket battery only from Fort Brown, one of the three main American fortifications. McGlassin and his fellow raiders also killed one British officer and six British troops while wounding several others. Once all of the British artillery equipment was destroyed, they withdrew safely, having suffered no casualties.

While skirmishing and exchanges of artillery fire continued, the British located a ford (Pike&#x27;s Ford) across the Saranac above Macomb&#x27;s defences. Prévost planned that, once Downie&#x27;s ships arrived, they would attack the American ships in Plattsburgh Bay. Simultaneously, Major General Brisbane would make a feint attack across the bridges over the Saranac while Major General Robinson&#x27;s brigade (less two of its battalions but reinforced by the light infantry companies of several other battalions) would cross the ford to make the main attack against the American left flank, supported by Major General Power&#x27;s brigade. Once the American ships had been defeated, Brisbane would make his feint attack into a real one.

==Naval battle==

===Prelude===

Macdonough had sent some of his gunboats to harass Prévost&#x27;s advance, but he knew that his fleet was outgunned, particularly in long guns. He therefore withdrew into Plattsburgh Bay, where the British would be forced to engage at close range, at which the American and British squadrons would be roughly even in numbers and weight of short-range carronades. He used the time before Downie arrived to drill his sailors, and make preparations to fight at anchor. The ships were anchored in line from north to south in the order &quot;Eagle&quot;, &quot;Saratoga&quot;, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and &quot;Preble&quot;. They all had both bow and stern anchors, with &quot;springs&quot; attached to the anchor cables to allow the ships to be slewed through a wide arc. Macdonough also laid out extra kedge anchors from the quarters of his flagship &quot;Saratoga&quot;, which would allow him to spin the ship completely around. The ten American gunboats were anchored in the intervals between the larger vessels.

Although the British sloops and gunboats under Commander Pring were already on the Lake and at anchor near Chazy, and had set up a battery on Isle La Motte, Vermont, it took two days to tow the frigate &quot;Confiance&quot; up the Sorel River from Ile aux Noix, against both wind and current. Downie finally joined the squadron on 9 September. Carpenters and riggers were still at work on the frigate, and the incomplete crew was augmented by a company of the 39th Foot. To Prévost&#x27;s fury, Downie was unable to attack on 10 September because the wind was unfavourable. During the night the wind shifted to the northeast, making an attack feasible.

The British squadron sailed in the early hours of 11 September, and announced their presence to Prévost&#x27;s army by &quot;scaling&quot; the guns i.e. firing them without shot to clear scale or rust from the barrels. Shortly after dawn, Downie reconnoitred the American dispositions from a rowing boat, before ordering the British squadron to attack. Addressing his crew, he told them that the British Army would storm Plattsburgh as soon as the ships engaged, &quot;and mind don&#x27;t let us be behind&quot;.

===Battle===
At about 9 am, the British squadron rounded Cumberland Head close-hauled in line abreast, with the large ships to the north initially in the order &quot;Chubb&quot;, &quot;Linnet&quot;, &quot;Confiance&quot; and &quot;Finch&quot;, and the gunboats to the south. It was a fine autumn day, but the wind was light and variable, and Downie was unable to manoeuvre &quot;Confiance&quot; to the place he intended, across the head of Macdonough&#x27;s line. As &quot;Confiance&quot; suffered increasing damage from the American ships, he was forced to drop anchor between 300 and 500 yards from Macdonough&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Saratoga&quot;. He then proceeded deliberately, securing everything before firing a broadside which killed or wounded one fifth of &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s crew. Macdonough was stunned but quickly recovered; and a few minutes later Downie was killed, crushed by a cannon flung from its carriage by a shot from &quot;Saratoga&quot;.
Elsewhere along the British line, the sloop &quot;Chubb&quot; was badly damaged and drifted into the American line, where her commander surrendered. The brig &quot;Linnet&quot;, commanded by Pring, reached the head of the American line and opened a raking fire against &quot;Eagle&quot;. At the tail of the line, the sloop &quot;Finch&quot; failed to reach station and anchor, and although hardly hit at all, &quot;Finch&quot; drifted aground on Crab Island, and surrendered under fire from the 6-pounder gun of the battery manned by the invalids from Macomb&#x27;s hospital.

Half the British gunboats were also hotly engaged at this end of the line. Their fire forced the weakest American vessel, &quot;Preble&quot; to cut its anchors and drift out of the fight. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; was able to fight them off, although it was engaged too heavily to support Macdonough&#x27;s flagship. The rest of the British gunboats apparently held back from action, and their commander later deserted.

After about an hour, &quot;Eagle&quot; had the springs to one of her anchor cables shot away, and was unable to bear to reply to &quot;Linnet&quot;″s raking fire. &quot;Eagle&quot;″s commander cut the remaining anchor cable and allowed the brig to drift down towards the tail of the line, before anchoring again astern of &quot;Saratoga&quot; and engaging &quot;Confiance&quot;, but allowing &quot;Linnet&quot; to rake &quot;Saratoga&quot;. Both flagships had fought each other to a standstill. After Downie and several of the other officers had been killed or injured, &quot;Confiance&quot;″s fire had become steadily less effective, but aboard &quot;Saratoga&quot;, almost all the starboard-side guns were dismounted or put out of action.

Macdonough ordered the bow anchor cut, and hauled in the kedge anchors he had laid out earlier to spin &quot;Saratoga&quot; around. This allowed &quot;Saratoga&quot; to bring its undamaged port battery into action. &quot;Confiance&quot; was unable to return the fire. The frigate&#x27;s surviving Lieutenant, James Robertson, tried to haul in on the springs to his only anchor to make a similar manoeuvre, but succeeded only in presenting the vulnerable stern to the American fire. Helpless, &quot;Confiance&quot; could only surrender. Macdonough hauled in further on his kedge anchors to bring his broadside to bear on &quot;Linnet&quot;. Pring sent a boat to &quot;Confiance&quot;, to find that Downie was dead and &quot;Confiance&quot; had struck its colours. &quot;Linnet&quot; also could only surrender, after being battered almost into sinking. The British gunboats withdrew, unmolested.

The surviving British officers boarded &quot;Saratoga&quot; to offer their swords (of surrender) to Macdonough. When he saw the officers, Macdonough replied, &quot;Gentlemen, return your swords to your scabbards, you are worthy of them&quot;. Commander Pring and the other surviving British officers later testified that Macdonough showed every consideration to the British wounded and prisoners.

Many of the British dead, not including the officers, were buried in an unmarked mass grave on nearby Crab Island, the site of the military hospital during the battle, where they remain today.

===The False Nile===

Both commanders would have seen the parallels of Macdonough&#x27;s anchorage on Lake Champlain to that of the French under Vice Admiral Francois-Paul Brueys, opposing British Rear Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson, at the Battle of the Nile in Aboukir Bay on 1 August 1798. A study of Nelson&#x27;s battles was part of the professional knowledge expected of naval commanders. But Macdonough did all that Brueys did not. He expected to take advantage of the prevailing winds on Lake Champlain that constrained Downie&#x27;s axis of approach. &quot;Because nearly every circumstance that worked to Nelson&#x27;s advantage proved disadvantageous to Downie, the Battle of Lake Champlain is sometimes called the &quot;False Nile&quot; by the English.&quot; The British naval historian William Laird Clowes regarded Macdonough&#x27;s &quot;False Nile&quot; victory as &quot;a most notable feat, one which, on the whole, surpassed that of any other captain of either navy in this war.&quot;

==Land battle==
Although Prévost&#x27;s attack was supposed to coincide with the naval engagement, it was slow to get under way. Orders to move were not issued until 10 a.m, when the battle on the lake had been under way for over an hour. The American and British batteries settled down to a duel in which the Americans gained a slight advantage, while Brisbane&#x27;s feint attack at the bridges was easily repulsed.

When a messenger arrived and notified Prévost that Downie&#x27;s ship had been defeated on the lake he realized that without the navy to supply and support his further advance, any military advantage gained by storming Plattsburgh would have been worthless. Prévost considered he therefore had no option but to retreat, and called off the assault. Bugle calls ordering the retreat sounded out along the British lines.

Robinson&#x27;s brigade had been misdirected by some British staff officers and missed the ford which was their objective. Once they had retraced their steps, Robinson&#x27;s brigade, led by eight companies of light infantry soon drove the defenders back, and the British had crossed the ford and were preparing to advance, when the orders arrived from Prévost to call off the attack. The light company of the British 76th Regiment of Foot had been skirmishing in advance of the main body. When the bugle calls to retire were heard it was too late and they were surrounded and cut off by overwhelming numbers of American militia. Captain John Purchas, commanding the company, was killed in the act of waving a flag of truce (his white waistcoat). Three officers and 31 other ranks of the 76th were made prisoner. The 76th also suffered one other man killed and three wounded.

Major General Brisbane protested the order to retreat but complied. The British began their retreat to Canada after dark. Although the British soldiers were ordered to destroy ammunition and stores they could not easily remove, large quantities of these were left intact. There had been little or no desertion from the British army during the advance and the skirmishing along the Saranac, but during the retreat at least 234 soldiers deserted. Very few of these desertions were from the Peninsular War veterans or the two Canadian units in Prévost&#x27;s force; most were from the Regiment de Meuron, which was a mixed bag of several nationalities, the 2/8th Regiment, which was a second-rate unit decimated by sickness in the Walcheren Campaign, and the 1/27th Foot, which had been stationed in Malta and had seen action in the abortive Siege of Tarragona.

The British casualties during the land engagement from 6–11 September were 37 killed, 150 wounded and 57 missing. Macomb reported 37 killed, 62 wounded and 20 missing but these losses were for the regular U.S. Army troops only. Historian William James remarked that the &quot;general return of loss among the militia and volunteers, no where appears&quot;. General Macomb wrote to his father that the American loss &quot;in the land battle&quot; was 115 killed and 130 wounded, a figure which suggests considerable casualties among the militia and volunteers.

==Results==

Macdonough&#x27;s victory had stopped the British offensive in its tracks. Also, Prévost had achieved what the U.S. government had been unable to do for the entire war up to that point: to bring the state of Vermont into the war.

The British had used their victories at the Battle of Bladensburg and the Burning of Washington to counter any American demands during the peace negotiations up to this point, despite the Americans&#x27; successful defense at the Battle of Baltimore in the days after this battle, and which ended British activities in the Mid-Atlantic region. American negotiators used the repulse at Plattsburgh to demand exclusive rights to Lake Champlain and denied Britain&#x27;s claim of exclusive rights to the Great Lakes. Thus, American actions at Plattsburgh and Baltimore denied the British any advantage they could use to make demands for territorial gains in the Treaty of Ghent, such as 
a pro-British Indian barrier state in the Midwest and the &quot;New Ireland&quot; colony established in the District of Maine.

The failure at Plattsburgh, with other complaints about his conduct of active operations, resulted in Sir George Prévost being relieved of command in Canada. When he returned to Britain his version of events was accepted at first. As was customary after the loss of a ship or a defeat, Commander Pring and the surviving officers and men of the squadron faced a court martial, which was held aboard HMS &quot;Gladiator&quot; at Portsmouth, between 18 and 21 August 1815. The court commended Pring and honorably acquitted all of those charged. The dispatches of Sir James Yeo were published about the same time, and emphatically placed the blame for the defeat on Prévost for forcing the British squadron into action prematurely. Prévost in turn demanded a court martial to clear his name, but died in 1816 before it could be held.

Alexander Macomb was promoted to Major General and became commanding general of the United States Army in 1828. Thomas Macdonough was promoted to Captain (and given the honorary rank of Commodore for his command of multiple ships in the battle) and is remembered as the &quot;Hero of Lake Champlain&quot;. To honor the American commanders, Congress struck four Congressional Gold Medals, a record number for the time. These were awarded to Captain Thomas Macdonough, Captain Robert Henley, and Lieutenant Stephen Cassin of the U.S. Navy, and to Alexander Macomb (20 October 1814 3 Stat. 245–247). Macomb and his men were also formally given the thanks of Congress.

Seven currently active regular battalions of the United States Army (4-1 FA, 1-2 Inf, 2-2 Inf, 1-5 Inf, 2-5 Inf, 1-6 Inf and 2-6 Inf) perpetuate the lineages of American units that were present at the battle (Brooks&#x27;s Company, Corps of Artillery, and the 6th, 13th and 29th Infantry Regiments).

<text>Bilberries () are Eurasian low-growing shrubs in the genus &quot;Vaccinium&quot; in the flowering plant family Ericaceae that bear edible, dark blue berries. They resemble but are distinct from North American blueberries.

The species most often referred to is &quot;Vaccinium myrtillus&quot; L., but the term describes several other closely related species.

== Etymology and regional names ==
The name &quot;bilberry&quot; appears to have a Scandinavian origin, possibly from as early as 1577, being similar to the Danish word &quot;bølle&quot; for whortleberry with the addition of &quot;berry&quot;. In Scandinavian languages, terms for bilberries have names that carry the meaning &quot;blueberry&quot;: e.g. &quot;blåbär&quot; in Swedish and &quot;blåbær&quot; in Danish and Norwegian.

The bilberry (especially &quot;Vaccinium myrtillus&quot;) is generally known as blaeberry in Scottish and Northern English regional dialects, and whortleberry in southern England.

== Description ==


Bilberries—which are native to Europe—are different from North American blueberries, although the species are closely related and belong to the same genus, &quot;Vaccinium&quot;.

Bilberry are non-climacteric fruits with a smooth, circular outline at the end opposite the stalk, whereas blueberries retain persistent sepals there, leaving a rough, star-shaped pattern of five flaps. Bilberries grow singly or in pairs rather than in clusters, as blueberries do, and blueberries have more evergreen leaves. Bilberries are dark in color, and often appear near black with a slight shade of purple.

Bilberries and blueberries contain diverse anthocyanins, specifically anthocyanidins, including delphinidin and cyanidin glycosides. While blueberry fruit pulp is light green, &quot;V. myrtillus&quot; bilberry pulp is red or purple and &quot;V. uliginosum&quot; bog bilberry pulp is pale-colored. The high anthocyanin content of &quot;V. myrtillus&quot; may cause staining of the fingers, lips, and tongue.

==Species==
The term &quot;bilberries&quot; can describe several closely related species, which (except for &quot;V. uliginosum&quot;) are part of section &quot;Myrtillus&quot;:
* &quot;Vaccinium myrtillus&quot; L. (bilberry)
* &quot;Vaccinium uliginosum&quot; L. (bog bilberry, bog blueberry, bog whortleberry, bog huckleberry, northern bilberry, ground hurts)
* &quot;Vaccinium cespitosum&quot; Michx. (dwarf bilberry)
* &quot;Vaccinium deliciosum&quot; Piper (Cascade bilberry)
* &quot;Vaccinium membranaceum&quot; (mountain bilberry, black mountain huckleberry, black huckleberry, twin-leaved huckleberry)
* &quot;Vaccinium ovalifolium&quot; (oval-leafed blueberry, oval-leaved bilberry, mountain blueberry, high-bush blueberry).

== Ecology ==
Bilberry plants can suffer from bilberry blight, caused by &quot;Phytophthora kernoviae&quot;. There have been severe outbreaks in Staffordshire, England.

Bilberry is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species.

== Harvesting ==

Bilberries are found in acidic, nutrient-poor soils throughout the temperate and subarctic regions of the world. They are difficult to grow and the fruit is small, so they are seldom cultivated. Fruits are mostly collected from wild plants growing on publicly accessible lands throughout northern and central Europe where they are plentiful; for example, up to a fifth (17–21%) of the land area of Sweden contains bilberry bushes, where it is called blåbär (lit. &quot;blueberry&quot;, which is a source of confusion with the American blueberry). Bilberries can be picked by a berry-picking rake like lingonberries, but are more susceptible to damage. They are softer and juicier than blueberries, making them difficult to transport. Because of these factors, fresh bilberries are only available from markets and gourmet stores. Frozen bilberries, however, are available year round in many parts of Europe.

In Iceland, bilberries (known as &quot;aðalbláber&quot;, or &quot;prime blueberry&quot;) grow predominantly in Westfjords and the surrounding area. In most of the country, the closely related bláber occupy the same habitat. Both species are commonly found growing with dwarf birch and crowberries. Wild growth is vast compared to the population of Iceland and wild harvesting is legal, and a popular activity in August when the berry season peaks.

== Uses ==

The fruits are eaten fresh or made into jams, fools, juices, or pies. In France and Italy, they are used as a base for liqueurs and are a popular flavouring for sorbets and other desserts. In Brittany, they are often used as a flavouring for crêpes. In the Vosges and the Massif Central, bilberry tart (&quot;tarte aux myrtilles&quot;) is a traditional dessert. In Romania, they are used as a base for a liqueur called &quot;afinată&quot; – the name of the fruit in Romanian is &quot;afină&quot;. In Nordic countries, they are eaten fresh or made into jams and other dishes, including bilberry pie (Finnish &quot;mustikkapiirakka&quot;, Swedish &quot;blåbärspaj&quot;) and &quot;blåbärssoppa&quot;, a bilberry soup served hot or cold. In Iceland they are popularly eaten with skyr (a cultured dairy product similar to yoghurt). In Poland, they are eaten fresh (often mixed with sugar), as a filling in a sweet yeast-leavened bun known as &quot;jagodzianka&quot;, in jams (known for their health benefits in the treatment of diarrhoea) and with śmietana (a soured cream) or unsoured cream as a sauce for rice or pasta for a light summertime meal.

===Research===
One review of low-quality clinical research concluded there was no evidence that consuming bilberries improves night vision. Although bilberries have been used in traditional medicine, there are no proven health benefits or anti-disease effects from consuming them.

== In culture ==
In Ireland, the fruit is known as &quot;fraughan&quot;, from the Irish &quot;fraochán&quot;, and is traditionally gathered on the last Sunday in July, known as &quot;Fraughan Sunday&quot;. Bilberries were also collected at the Celtic festival of Lughnasadh in August, the first traditional harvest festival of the year. The crop of bilberries was said to indicate how well the rest of the crops would fare in their harvests later in the year.

<text>Atari Panther was the codename for a cancelled video game console from Atari Corporation planned as the successor to the Atari 7800 and the Atari XEGS. It was developed by Flare Technology, the same ex-Sinclair team who worked on the cancelled Flare One and Konix Multisystem consoles. It was planned to be a 16-bit console and was slated at one point to be 32-bit.

Work started in 1988 with a planned 1991 release to compete with the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Genesis. The Panther was never commercially released as the design was abandoned for the Atari Jaguar.

==Hardware==
The system has three primary chips:
#A Motorola 68000 running at 16 MHz
#An object processor called the &quot;Panther&quot;
#An Ensoniq sound processor, nicknamed &quot;Otis&quot;, with 32 channels (presumably an ES5505)

<doc id="203970" wikidata="Q20977" url="?curid=203970" title="Hoopoe">
<text>Hoopoes () are colourful birds found across Africa, Asia, and Europe, notable for their distinctive &quot;crown&quot; of feathers which can be raised or lowered at will. Three living and one extinct species are recognized, though for many years all of the extant species were lumped as a single species—&quot;Upupa epops&quot;. In fact, some taxonomists still consider all three species conspecific. Some authorities also keep the African and Eurasian hoopoe together but split the Madagascar hoopoe. The Eurasian hoopoe is common in its range and has a large population, so it is evaluated as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, their numbers are declining in Western Europe. Conversely, the hoopoe has been increasing in numbers at the tip of the South Sinai, Sharm el-Sheikh. There are dozens of nesting pairs that remain resident all year round.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Upupa&quot; was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The type species is the Eurasian hoopoe (&quot;Upupa epops&quot;). &quot;Upupa&quot; and ἔποψ (&quot;epops&quot;) are respectively the Latin and Ancient Greek names for the hoopoe; both, like the English name, are onomatopoeic forms which imitate the cry of the bird.

The hoopoe was classified in the clade Coraciiformes, which also includes kingfishers, bee-eaters, and rollers. A close relationship between the hoopoe and the wood hoopoes is also supported by the shared and unique nature of their stapes. In the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, the hoopoe is separated from the Coraciiformes as a separate order, the Upupiformes. Some authorities place the wood hoopoes in the Upupiformes as well. Now the consensus is that both hoopoe and the wood hoopoes belong with the hornbills in the Bucerotiformes.

The fossil record of the hoopoes is very incomplete, with the earliest fossil coming from the Quaternary. The fossil record of their relatives is older, with fossil wood hoopoes dating back to the Miocene and those of an extinct related family, the Messelirrisoridae, dating from the Eocene.

===Species===
Formerly considered a single species, the hoopoe has been split into three separate species: the Eurasian hoopoe, Madagascar hoopoe and the resident African hoopoe. One accepted separate species, the Saint Helena hoopoe, lived on the island of St Helena but became extinct in the 16th century, presumably due to introduced species.

The genus &quot;Upupa&quot; was created by Linnaeus in his &quot;Systema naturae&quot; in 1758. It then included three other species with long curved bills:

*&quot;U. eremita&quot; (now &quot;Geronticus eremita&quot;), the northern bald ibis
*&quot;U. pyrrhocorax&quot; (now &quot;Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax&quot;), the red-billed chough
*&quot;U. paradisea&quot;

Formerly, the greater hoopoe-lark was also considered to be a member of this genus (as &quot;Upupa alaudipes&quot;).

====Extant species====
==Distribution and habitat==


Hoopoes are widespread in Europe, Asia, and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. Most European and north Asian birds migrate to the tropics in winter. In contrast, the African populations are sedentary all year. The species has been a vagrant in Alaska; &quot;U. e. saturata&quot; was recorded there in 1975 in the Yukon Delta. Hoopoes have been known to breed north of their European range, and in southern England during warm, dry summers that provide plenty of grasshoppers and similar insects, although as of the early 1980s northern European populations were reported to be in the decline, possibly due to changes in climate.

The hoopoe has two basic requirements of its habitat: bare or lightly vegetated ground on which to forage and vertical surfaces with cavities (such as trees, cliffs or even walls, nestboxes, haystacks, and abandoned burrows) in which to nest. These requirements can be provided in a wide range of ecosystems, and as a consequence the hoopoe inhabits a wide range of habitats such as heathland, wooded steppes, savannas and grasslands, as well as forest glades. The Madagascar species also makes use of more dense primary forest. The modification of natural habitats by humans for various agricultural purposes has led to hoopoes becoming common in olive groves, orchards, vineyards, parkland and farmland, although they are less common and are declining in intensively farmed areas. Hunting is of concern in southern Europe and Asia.

Hoopoes make seasonal movements in response to rain in some regions such as in Ceylon and in the Western Ghats. Birds have been seen at high altitudes during migration across the Himalayas. One was recorded at about by the first Mount Everest expedition.

==Behaviour and ecology==
In what was long thought to be a defensive posture, hoopoes sunbathe by spreading out their wings and tail low against the ground and tilting their head up; they often fold their wings and preen halfway through. They also enjoy taking dust and sand baths. Adults may begin their moult after the breeding season and continue after they have migrated for the winter.

===Diet and feeding===

The diet of the hoopoe is mostly composed of insects, although small reptiles, frogs and plant matter such as seeds and berries are sometimes taken as well. It is a solitary forager which typically feeds on the ground. More rarely they will feed in the air, where their strong and rounded wings make them fast and manoeuverable, in pursuit of numerous swarming insects. More commonly their foraging style is to stride over relatively open ground and periodically pause to probe the ground with the full length of their bill. Insect larvae, pupae and mole crickets are detected by the bill and either extracted or dug out with the strong feet. Hoopoes will also feed on insects on the surface, probe into piles of leaves, and even use the bill to lever large stones and flake off bark. Common diet items include crickets, locusts, beetles, earwigs, cicadas, ant lions, bugs and ants. These can range from in length, with a preferred prey size of around . Larger prey items are beaten against the ground or a preferred stone to kill them and remove indigestible body parts such as wings and legs.

===Breeding===
Hoopoes are monogamous, although the pair bond apparently only lasts for a single season. They are also territorial. The male calls frequently to advertise his ownership of the territory. Chases and fights between rival males (and sometimes females) are common and can be brutal. Birds will try to stab rivals with their bills, and individuals are occasionally blinded in fights. The nest is in a hole in a tree or wall, and has a narrow entrance. It may be unlined, or various scraps may be collected. The female alone is responsible for incubating the eggs. Clutch size varies with location: Northern Hemisphere birds lay more eggs than those in the Southern Hemisphere, and birds at higher latitudes have larger clutches than those closer to the equator. In central and northern Europe and Asia the clutch size is around 12, whereas it is around four in the tropics and seven in the subtropics. The eggs are round and milky blue when laid, but quickly discolour in the increasingly dirty nest. They weigh . A replacement clutch is possible. When food is bountiful, the female will lay a few extra eggs for the purpose of providing food for chicks that have already hatched. In a study done in Spain, it was found that nests with a higher incidence of cannibalism successfully fledged more chicks than in nests where hatchlings weren&#x27;t fed to older chicks.

Hoopoes have well-developed anti-predator defences in the nest. The uropygial gland of the incubating and brooding female is quickly modified to produce a foul-smelling liquid, and the glands of nestlings do so as well. These secretions are rubbed into the plumage. The secretion, which smells like rotting meat, is thought to help deter predators, as well as deter parasites and possibly act as an antibacterial agent. The secretions stop soon before the young leave the nest. From the age of six days, nestlings can also direct streams of faeces at intruders, and will hiss at them in a snake-like fashion. The young also strike with their bill or with one wing.

The incubation period for the species is between 15 and 18 days, during which time the male feeds the female. Incubation begins as soon as the first egg is laid, so the chicks are born asynchronously. The chicks hatch with a covering of downy feathers. By around day three to five, feather quills emerge which will become the adult feathers. The chicks are brooded by the female for between 9 and 14 days. The female later joins the male in the task of bringing food. The young fledge in 26 to 29 days and remain with the parents for about a week more.

==Relationship with humans==
The diet of the hoopoe includes many species considered by humans to be pests, such as the pupae of the processionary moth, a damaging forest pest which few other birds will eat because of its irritating hairs. For this reason the species is afforded protection under the law in many countries.

===In folklore, myth and religion===
Hoopoes are distinctive birds and have made a cultural impact over much of their range. They were considered sacred in Ancient Egypt, and were &quot;depicted on the walls of tombs and temples&quot;. At the Old Kingdom, the hoopoe was used in the iconography as a symbolic code to indicate the child was the heir and successor of his father. They achieved a similar standing in Minoan Crete.

In the Torah, Leviticus 11:13–19, hoopoes were listed among the animals that are detestable and should not be eaten. They are also listed in Deuteronomy as not kosher.

The Hoopoe, known as the (), also appears with King Solomon in the Quran in Surah 27 (The Ant):
The connection of the hoopoe with Solomon and the Queen of Sheba in the Qur&#x27;anic tradition is mentioned in passing in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Just So&quot; story &quot;The Butterfly that Stamped&quot;.

In the pre-Islamic Vainakh religion of Chechnya, Ingushetia and Dagestan the hoopoe was sacred to the goddess Tusholi and known as &quot;Tusholi&#x27;s hen&quot;. As her bird, it could only be hunted with the express permission of the goddess&#x27;s high priest, and even then only for strictly medicinal purposes.

Hoopoes were seen as a symbol of virtue in Persia. A hoopoe was a leader of the birds in the Persian book of poems &quot;The Conference of the Birds&quot; ( by Attar) and when the birds seek a king, the hoopoe points out that the Simurgh was the king of the birds.

Hoopoes were thought of as thieves across much of Europe, and harbingers of war in Scandinavia. In Estonian tradition, hoopoes are strongly connected with death and the underworld; their song is believed to foreshadow death for many people or cattle. In medieval ritual magic, the hoopoe was thought to be an evil bird. The &quot;Munich Manual of Demonic Magic&quot;, a collection of magical spells compiled in Germany frequently requires the sacrifice of a hoopoe to summon demons and perform other magical intentions.

Tereus, transformed into the hoopoe, is the king of the birds in the Ancient Greek comedy &quot;The Birds&quot; by Aristophanes. In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, book 6, King Tereus of Thrace rapes Philomela, his wife Procne&#x27;s sister, and cuts out her tongue. In revenge, Procne kills their son Itys and serves him as a stew to his father. When Tereus sees the boy&#x27;s head, which is served on a platter, he grabs a sword but just as he attempts to kill the sisters, they are turned into birds—Procne into a swallow and Philomela into a nightingale. Tereus himself is turned into an &quot;epops&quot; (6.674), translated as &quot;lapwing&quot; by Dryden and &quot;lappewincke&quot; (&quot;lappewinge&quot;) by John Gower in his &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot;, or &quot;hoopoe&quot; in A.S. Kline&#x27;s translation. The bird&#x27;s crest indicates his royal status, and his long, sharp beak is a symbol of his violent nature. English translators and poets probably had the northern lapwing in mind, considering its crest.

===As emblem===
The Eurasian hoopoe was chosen as the national bird of Israel in May 2008 in conjunction with the country&#x27;s 60th anniversary, following a national survey of 155,000 citizens, outpolling the white-spectacled bulbul. The hoopoe appears on the logo of the University of Johannesburg and is the official mascot of the university&#x27;s sports teams. The municipalities of Armstedt and Brechten, Germany, have a hoopoe in their coats of arms, as does Mārupe Municipality since 2021.

===Use in folk medicine===
In Morocco, hoopoes are traded live and as medicinal products in the markets, primarily in herbalist shops. This trade is unregulated and a potential threat to local populations.

In Manipur, one of the states comprising Northeast India, the hoopoe is still used by traditional Muslim healers in a variety of preparations believed locally to benefit a number of conditions both medical and spiritual.
Manipur abuts upon Myanmar and has been a cultural crossroads and melting pot of cultures for over 2,500 years. Its traditional medicine may thus reflect influences from an unusually wide area, including not only the Indian subcontinent but also Central Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia and even the further-flung regions of Siberia, the Arctic, Micronesia and Polynesia. Ibopishak and Bimola record four Manipuri folk medicinal uses of the hoopoe which specify neither the body part of the bird used nor its method of preparation: 
*as a tranquilizer
*in the treatment of abdominal pain, 
*in the treatment of kidney and bladder disorders
*in the &quot;prevention of leprosy&quot;
More specifically, it is believed that if an essence (method of preparation unspecified) prepared from the bird is dropped into the eye, it will remove superfluous eyelashes and strengthen the memory.

Furthermore the authors record the following local Manipuri beliefs concerning specific body parts of the hoopoe:
*that its meat prevents frequent urination; 
*that its feathers have the insecticidal property of killing ants and fleas 
*that its blood banishes fairies (jinn) and nightmares
*that its heart cures (unspecified) diseases 
*that its claws can be used to cure speech disorders.

While Ibopishak and Bimola are unable to find any discernible effect of hoopoe tissue alone upon the dissolution of kidney stones, they do note that their experiments reveal that hoopoe tissue potentiates the effects of the Manipuri medicinal plant &quot;Cissus javana&quot;, when employed to treat such calculi (local healers use bird and plant in just such a combination for this purpose). Since, however, there was no control used involving the tissues of any other bird species, it remains unclear whether there are any medicinal properties peculiar to hoopoe tissue deriving from a distinctive chemistry.

===In popular culture===
Harrison Tordoff, a World War II fighter ace and later a noted ornithologist, named his P-51 Mustang &quot;Upupa epops&quot;, the scientific name of the hoopoe bird.

A talking hoopoe named Almost Brilliant is a character in Nghi Vo&#x27;s &quot;Singing Hills Cycle&quot;, first appearing in &quot;The Empress of Salt and Fortune&quot;.

<text>The League of Gentlemen is a 1960 British heist action comedy film directed by Basil Dearden and starring Jack Hawkins, Nigel Patrick, Roger Livesey and Richard Attenborough. It is based on John Boland&#x27;s 1958 novel of the same name, and features a screenplay written by Bryan Forbes, who also co-starred in the film.

==Plot==
A manhole opens at night in an empty street, and out climbs Lieutenant-Colonel Norman Hyde in a dinner suit. He gets into a Rolls-Royce and drives home. There, Hyde prepares seven envelopes, each containing an American crime paperback titled &quot;The Golden Fleece&quot;, one half of each of ten £5-notes, and an invitation to a lunch at the Cafe Royal hosted by &quot;Co-Operative Removals Ltd.&quot;

Hyde sends the envelopes to former army officers, each of whom is in desperate or humiliating circumstances, and they all turn up at the lunch to get the other halves of their £5-notes. When Hyde asks their opinion of the novel, which is about a robbery, the men show little enthusiasm for it, but their interest is piqued when he reveals his knowledge of the misdeeds that led each man to leave or be kicked out of the military. Although he has no criminal record himself, Hyde holds a grudge for being made redundant by the army after 25 years of service and intends to rob a bank using the skills of the gathered men, each of whom is to get an equal share of £100,000 or more.

The gang meet again to discuss the plan in greater detail under the guise of an amateur dramatic society rehearsing &quot;Journey’s End&quot;. After agreeing to Hyde&#x27;s plan, they move into his house, where they live like a military unit, complete with a regimen of duties and discipline in the form of monetary fines. Hyde reveals that he has spent the past year collecting details about the regular delivery of approximately a million pounds in used banknotes to a City of London bank.

To get weapons for the robbery, the gang raid an army training camp in Dorset. Hyde, Race, Mycroft, and Porthill create a distraction by posing as senior officers on an unscheduled food inspection, while Lexy and Stevens pose as telephone repairmen to infiltrate the camp and then steal the weapons, aided by Rutland-Smith and Weaver. The thieves speak in Irish accents to make it seem as though the IRA is responsible for the raid.

In Hyde’s basement, the gang studies maps, models, and surveillance footage to prepare for the bank robbery. Hyde also rents a warehouse, where the men modify the cars and lorry that Race steals, such as by fitting them with false number plates. One day, their work is interrupted by a passing policeman, who has noticed the warehouse is in use and offers to keep an eye on it as he patrols his beat, but the gang does not think he could have seen anything suspicious. On the eve of the bank robbery, Hyde destroys the plans and makes a speech thanking the men for their hard work.

The robbery is bloodless and precise. Using smoke bombs, Sterling submachine guns, and radio jamming equipment, the gang raids a bank near St Paul&#x27;s, seizes the money, and escapes. Back at Hyde’s house, their celebration is interrupted by the unexpected arrival of Hyde&#x27;s former military commander, &quot;Bunny&quot; Warren. As Bunny recalls the old days and Hyde gets him drunk, the members of the gang leave one by one, each taking a suitcase filled with his share of the loot.

When everyone is gone but Race, the telephone rings—it is Superintendent Wheatlock. Race tells Hyde, who sends Race to try to escape out the back, while he talks with Wheatlock. Hyde learns that a small boy had been collecting car registration numbers (a common hobby at the time) outside the bank just before the robbery, and he gave his list to the police, who discovered a number that matched one noted by the policeman who visited the warehouse. The policeman had also noted the number of Hyde&#x27;s own car, which was parked outside the warehouse, thus establishing a link between the robbery and Hyde.

Defeated, Hyde walks out his front door with Bunny and is met by searchlights and a small army of police officers and soldiers. He is escorted to a police van and finds the rest of his gang already inside, as they had each been captured as soon as they left the house.

==Cast==
==Production==
Allied Film Makers was a short-lived production company founded by Dearden; actors Hawkins, Forbes, and Attenborough; and producer Michael Relph. Forbes contributed many of the company&#x27;s scripts.

The portrait of Hyde&#x27;s wife is a close copy of a portrait of Deborah Kerr that was created for &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; (1943), which stars Roger Livesey (who plays Mycroft in &quot;The League&quot;) in the title role. Forbes points out in his DVD commentary for &quot;The League&quot; that, in most films of the time, Hyde&#x27;s wife would be described as dead, rather than dismissed with a comment such as Hyde&#x27;s that &quot;I regret to say the bitch is still going strong.&quot;

After Hyde leaves the lunch party, there are two scenes in the script that did not make it into the finished film. In the first, Weaver, although reminded by Lexy that he is a teetotaler, drinks some brandy. In the second, Hyde, followed by Race, visits a teenage girl at school, who, as her photo is also on Hyde&#x27;s desk, is implied to be his daughter.

Cary Grant was offered the part of Hyde, but turned it down. Richard Todd claims he also turned down a lead role.

Queens Gate Place Mews, SW7, was used as the filming location for Lexy&#x27;s repair shop.

The erotic magazines in Mycroft&#x27;s suitcase at the beginning of the film were borrowed from the set of &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; (1960), which was being filmed at Pinewood Studios at the same time as &quot;The League&quot;.

&quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot; was mentioned in the film &quot;The Wrong Arm of the Law&quot; (1963) as one of the films that &quot;Pearly&quot; Gates (Peter Sellers) was going to show his gang of crooks as a part of his training programme.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was a financial success. It was the sixth most popular film at the UK box office in 1960, and it had earned a profit of £250,000 by 1971. Over 20 years later, Bryan Forbes estimated the profit at between £300,000 and £400,000.

===Critical===
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: Given a slightly different approach, this film might have developed into an ironic study of the decline of the officer class in peacetime; a valid enough subject, especially when one considers the varying shifts in social status to be encountered in the post-war British scene. Instead, the film concentrates on suspense rather than character investigation. Each of the Gentlemen is introduced by a little establishing scene, after which the script fails to develop their idiosyncracies and, in fact, weakens its own possibilities by making them all basically shady characters. Bryan Forbes (as in his script for &quot;The Angry Silence&quot; (1960)) brings a lively surface edge to the dialogue, but tends to overdo the slick, ripe repartee as well as imposing on his characters a variety of fashionable perversions. As a study of a certain strata of society, then, the film lacks a strong centre and a firm point of view – one is never quite sure how seriously the parody of the officer code is intended, especially in the ambiguous, obligatorily moral ending. Judged as a thriller, it is more successful: the two big set-pieces (the army camp robbery and the raid itself) are quite skilfully put together, although the former suffers from an overdose of tired Army humour. The handling of these scenes and the extensive location shooting suggest that, for Basil Dearden, the film&#x27;s interest (and challenge) was mainly a technical one. In any case, it is his sharpest, most alive film for several years with rather less of his customary, mechanical shockcutting. The players, on the other hand, are often forced by the script&#x27;s limitations to fall back on familiar mannerisms – Jack Hawkins is altogether too smooth and heavy and Nigel Patrick&#x27;s oily bounder brings no revelation. Roger Livesey has some dry moments as a spurious officer doing the rounds whilst Robert Coote&#x27;s drunken intervention enlivens the somewhat anti-climactic climax.

At the time of its American release, Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;neatly written and expertly played&quot;, and said it features &quot;a devilishly inventive and amusing screen play by Mr. Forbes&quot; and &quot;is directed crisply and spinningly by Basil Dearden&quot;.

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; has called the film &quot;a masterpiece of British cinema&quot;. Dennis Schwartz called it &quot;a fine example of old-fashioned English humor: droll and civil.&quot; &quot;Time Out&quot; called it &quot;A terrific caper movie ... with typically excellent character playing from a lovable set of old lags.&quot;

&quot;The Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; gave the film 4/5 stars, writing: &quot;This was the first feature from the Allied Film Makers company, with most of its founder members – producer Michael Relph, director Basil Dearden, screenwriter Bryan Forbes and actors Jack Hawkins and Richard Attenborough – making solid contributions to this rousing crime caper. Dating from a time when every third word a crook said didn&#x27;t begin with an &#x27;f&#x27;, this distant ancestor of such bungled heist pics as &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; gets off to a rather stodgy start, but, once Hawkins has assembled his far from magnificent seven and his intricate plan begins to unravel, the action really hots up.&quot;

Leslie Halliwell said: &quot;Delightfully handled comedy adventure, from the days (alas) when crime did not pay; a lighter ending would have made it a classic.&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot; was included, along with three other Dearden films, in The Criterion Collection&#x27;s 2010 Eclipse Series box set &quot;Basil Dearden’s London Underground&quot;.

In 2006, a restored version of the film was released as a special edition DVD in the UK. The extras on this release include a &quot;South Bank Show&quot; documentary on Attenborough and a PDF version of Forbes&#x27; original script. An audio commentary for the film was provided by Forbes and his wife, Nanette Newman, who portrays Major Rutland-Smith&#x27;s wife in the film.

<text>A Bayesian network (also known as a Bayes network, Bayes net, belief network, or decision network) is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). While it is one of several forms of causal notation, causal networks are special cases of Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks are ideal for taking an event that occurred and predicting the likelihood that any one of several possible known causes was the contributing factor. For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases.

Efficient algorithms can perform inference and learning in Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables (&quot;e.g.&quot; speech signals or protein sequences) are called dynamic Bayesian networks. Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.

==Graphical model==
Formally, Bayesian networks are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) whose nodes represent variables in the Bayesian sense: they may be observable quantities, latent variables, unknown parameters or hypotheses. Each edge represents a direct conditional dependency. Any pair of nodes that are not connected (i.e. no path connects one node to the other) represent variables that are conditionally independent of each other. Each node is associated with a probability function that takes, as input, a particular set of values for the node&#x27;s parent variables, and gives (as output) the probability (or probability distribution, if applicable) of the variable represented by the node. For example, if formula_1 parent nodes represent formula_1 Boolean variables, then the probability function could be represented by a table of entries, one entry for each of the possible parent combinations. Similar ideas may be applied to undirected, and possibly cyclic, graphs such as Markov networks.

==Example==
Let us use an illustration to enforce the concepts of a Bayesian network. Suppose we want to model the dependencies between three variables: the sprinkler (or more appropriately, its state - whether it is on or not), the presence or absence of rain and whether the grass is wet or not. Observe that two events can cause the grass to become wet: an active sprinkler or rain. Rain has a direct effect on the use of the sprinkler (namely that when it rains, the sprinkler usually is not active). This situation can be modeled with a Bayesian network (shown to the right). Each variable has two possible values, T (for true) and F (for false).

The joint probability function is, by the chain rule of probability,

: formula_3

where &quot;G&quot; = &quot;Grass wet (true/false)&quot;, &quot;S&quot; = &quot;Sprinkler turned on (true/false)&quot;, and &quot;R&quot; = &quot;Raining (true/false)&quot;.

The model can answer questions about the presence of a cause given the presence of an effect (so-called inverse probability) like &quot;What is the probability that it is raining, given the grass is wet?&quot; by using the conditional probability formula and summing over all nuisance variables:

: formula_4

Using the expansion for the joint probability function formula_5 and the conditional probabilities from the conditional probability tables (CPTs) stated in the diagram, one can evaluate each term in the sums in the numerator and denominator. For example,

: formula_6

Then the numerical results (subscripted by the associated variable values) are

: formula_7

To answer an interventional question, such as &quot;What is the probability that it would rain, given that we wet the grass?&quot; the answer is governed by the post-intervention joint distribution function

: formula_8

obtained by removing the factor formula_9 from the pre-intervention distribution. The do operator forces the value of G to be true. The probability of rain is unaffected by the action:

: formula_10

To predict the impact of turning the sprinkler on:

: formula_11

with the term formula_12 removed, showing that the action affects the grass but not the rain.

These predictions may not be feasible given unobserved variables, as in most policy evaluation problems. The effect of the action formula_13 can still be predicted, however, whenever the back-door criterion is satisfied. It states that, if a set &quot;Z&quot; of nodes can be observed that &quot;d&quot;-separates (or blocks) all back-door paths from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; then

: formula_14

A back-door path is one that ends with an arrow into &quot;X&quot;. Sets that satisfy the back-door criterion are called &quot;sufficient&quot; or &quot;admissible.&quot; For example, the set &quot;Z&quot; = &quot;R&quot; is admissible for predicting the effect of &quot;S&quot; = &quot;T&quot; on &quot;G&quot;, because &quot;R&quot; &quot;d&quot;-separates the (only) back-door path &quot;S&quot; ← &quot;R&quot; → &quot;G&quot;. However, if &quot;S&quot; is not observed, no other set &quot;d&quot;-separates this path and the effect of turning the sprinkler on (&quot;S&quot; = &quot;T&quot;) on the grass (&quot;G&quot;) cannot be predicted from passive observations. In that case &quot;P&quot;(&quot;G&quot; | do(&quot;S&quot; = &quot;T&quot;)) is not &quot;identified&quot;. This reflects the fact that, lacking interventional data, the observed dependence between &quot;S&quot; and &quot;G&quot; is due to a causal connection or is spurious
(apparent dependence arising from a common cause, &quot;R&quot;). (see Simpson&#x27;s paradox)

To determine whether a causal relation is identified from an arbitrary Bayesian network with unobserved variables, one can use the three rules of &quot;&quot;do&quot;-calculus&quot; and test whether all &quot;do&quot; terms can be removed from the expression of that relation, thus confirming that the desired quantity is estimable from frequency data.

Using a Bayesian network can save considerable amounts of memory over exhaustive probability tables, if the dependencies in the joint distribution are sparse. For example, a naive way of storing the conditional probabilities of 10 two-valued variables as a table requires storage space for formula_15 values. If no variable&#x27;s local distribution depends on more than three parent variables, the Bayesian network representation stores at most formula_16 values.

One advantage of Bayesian networks is that it is intuitively easier for a human to understand (a sparse set of) direct dependencies and local distributions than complete joint distributions.

==Inference and learning==
Bayesian networks perform three main inference tasks:

===Inferring unobserved variables===
Because a Bayesian network is a complete model for its variables and their relationships, it can be used to answer probabilistic queries about them. For example, the network can be used to update knowledge of the state of a subset of variables when other variables (the &quot;evidence&quot; variables) are observed. This process of computing the &quot;posterior&quot; distribution of variables given evidence is called probabilistic inference. The posterior gives a universal sufficient statistic for detection applications, when choosing values for the variable subset that minimize some expected loss function, for instance the probability of decision error. A Bayesian network can thus be considered a mechanism for automatically applying Bayes&#x27; theorem to complex problems.

The most common exact inference methods are: variable elimination, which eliminates (by integration or summation) the non-observed non-query variables one by one by distributing the sum over the product; clique tree propagation, which caches the computation so that many variables can be queried at one time and new evidence can be propagated quickly; and recursive conditioning and AND/OR search, which allow for a space–time tradeoff and match the efficiency of variable elimination when enough space is used. All of these methods have complexity that is exponential in the network&#x27;s treewidth. The most common approximate inference algorithms are importance sampling, stochastic MCMC simulation, mini-bucket elimination, loopy belief propagation, generalized belief propagation and variational methods.

===Parameter learning===
In order to fully specify the Bayesian network and thus fully represent the joint probability distribution, it is necessary to specify for each node &quot;X&quot; the probability distribution for &quot;X&quot; conditional upon &quot;X&quot; parents. The distribution of &quot;X&quot; conditional upon its parents may have any form. It is common to work with discrete or Gaussian distributions since that simplifies calculations. Sometimes only constraints on distribution are known; one can then use the principle of maximum entropy to determine a single distribution, the one with the greatest entropy given the constraints. (Analogously, in the specific context of a dynamic Bayesian network, the conditional distribution for the hidden state&#x27;s temporal evolution is commonly specified to maximize the entropy rate of the implied stochastic process.)

Often these conditional distributions include parameters that are unknown and must be estimated from data, e.g., via the maximum likelihood approach. Direct maximization of the likelihood (or of the posterior probability) is often complex given unobserved variables. A classical approach to this problem is the expectation-maximization algorithm, which alternates computing expected values of the unobserved variables conditional on observed data, with maximizing the complete likelihood (or posterior) assuming that previously computed expected values are correct. Under mild regularity conditions, this process converges on maximum likelihood (or maximum posterior) values for parameters.

A more fully Bayesian approach to parameters is to treat them as additional unobserved variables and to compute a full posterior distribution over all nodes conditional upon observed data, then to integrate out the parameters. This approach can be expensive and lead to large dimension models, making classical parameter-setting approaches more tractable.

===Structure learning===

In the simplest case, a Bayesian network is specified by an expert and is then used to perform inference. In other applications, the task of defining the network is too complex for humans. In this case, the network structure and the parameters of the local distributions must be learned from data.

Automatically learning the graph structure of a Bayesian network (BN) is a challenge pursued within machine learning. The basic idea goes back to a recovery algorithm developed by Rebane and Pearl and rests on the distinction between the three possible patterns allowed in a 3-node DAG:

The first 2 represent the same dependencies (formula_17 and formula_18 are independent given formula_19) and are, therefore, indistinguishable. The collider, however, can be uniquely identified, since formula_17 and formula_18 are marginally independent and all other pairs are dependent. Thus, while the &quot;skeletons&quot; (the graphs stripped of arrows) of these three triplets are identical, the directionality of the arrows is partially identifiable. The same distinction applies when formula_17 and formula_18 have common parents, except that one must first condition on those parents. Algorithms have been developed to systematically determine the skeleton of the underlying graph and, then, orient all arrows whose directionality is dictated by the conditional independences observed.

An alternative method of structural learning uses optimization-based search. It requires a scoring function and a search strategy. A common scoring function is posterior probability of the structure given the training data, like the BIC or the BDeu. The time requirement of an exhaustive search returning a structure that maximizes the score is superexponential in the number of variables. A local search strategy makes incremental changes aimed at improving the score of the structure. A global search algorithm like Markov chain Monte Carlo can avoid getting trapped in local minima. Friedman et al. discuss using mutual information between variables and finding a structure that maximizes this. They do this by restricting the parent candidate set to &quot;k&quot; nodes and exhaustively searching therein.

A particularly fast method for exact BN learning is to cast the problem as an optimization problem, and solve it using integer programming. Acyclicity constraints are added to the integer program (IP) during solving in the form of cutting planes. Such method can handle problems with up to 100 variables.

In order to deal with problems with thousands of variables, a different approach is necessary. One is to first sample one ordering, and then find the optimal BN structure with respect to that ordering. This implies working on the search space of the possible orderings, which is convenient as it is smaller than the space of network structures. Multiple orderings are then sampled and evaluated. This method has been proven to be the best available in literature when the number of variables is huge.

Another method consists of focusing on the sub-class of decomposable models, for which the MLE have a closed form. It is then possible to discover a consistent structure for hundreds of variables.

Learning Bayesian networks with bounded treewidth is necessary to allow exact, tractable inference, since the worst-case inference complexity is exponential in the treewidth k (under the exponential time hypothesis). Yet, as a global property of the graph, it considerably increases the difficulty of the learning process. In this context it is possible to use K-tree for effective learning.

==Statistical introduction==

Given data formula_24 and parameter formula_25, a simple Bayesian analysis starts with a prior probability (&quot;prior&quot;) formula_26 and likelihood formula_27 to compute a posterior probability formula_28.

Often the prior on formula_25 depends in turn on other parameters formula_30 that are not mentioned in the likelihood. So, the prior formula_26 must be replaced by a likelihood formula_32, and a prior formula_33 on the newly introduced parameters formula_30 is required, resulting in a posterior probability

: formula_35

This is the simplest example of a &quot;hierarchical Bayes model&quot;.

The process may be repeated; for example, the parameters formula_30 may depend in turn on additional parameters formula_37, which require their own prior. Eventually the process must terminate, with priors that do not depend on unmentioned parameters.

===Introductory examples===
Given the measured quantities formula_38each with normally distributed errors of known standard deviation formula_39,

: formula_40

Suppose we are interested in estimating the formula_41. An approach would be to estimate the formula_41 using a maximum likelihood approach; since the observations are independent, the likelihood factorizes and the maximum likelihood estimate is simply

: formula_43

However, if the quantities are related, so that for example the individual formula_41have themselves been drawn from an underlying distribution, then this relationship destroys the independence and suggests a more complex model, e.g.,

: formula_45
: formula_46

with improper priors formula_47, formula_48. When formula_49, this is an &quot;identified model&quot; (i.e. there exists a unique solution for the model&#x27;s parameters), and the posterior distributions of the individual formula_41 will tend to move, or &quot;shrink&quot; away from the maximum likelihood estimates towards their common mean. This &quot;shrinkage&quot; is a typical behavior in hierarchical Bayes models.

===Restrictions on priors===
Some care is needed when choosing priors in a hierarchical model, particularly on scale variables at higher levels of the hierarchy such as the variable formula_51 in the example. The usual priors such as the Jeffreys prior often do not work, because the posterior distribution will not be normalizable and estimates made by minimizing the expected loss will be inadmissible.

==Definitions and concepts==

Several equivalent definitions of a Bayesian network have been offered. For the following, let &quot;G&quot; = (&quot;V&quot;,&quot;E&quot;) be a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and let &quot;X&quot; = (&quot;X&quot;&quot;v&quot;), &quot;v&quot; ∈ &quot;V&quot; be a set of random variables indexed by &quot;V&quot;.

===Factorization definition===
&quot;X&quot; is a Bayesian network with respect to &quot;G&quot; if its joint probability density function (with respect to a product measure) can be written as a product of the individual density functions, conditional on their parent variables:

: formula_52

where pa(&quot;v&quot;) is the set of parents of &quot;v&quot; (i.e. those vertices pointing directly to &quot;v&quot; via a single edge).

For any set of random variables, the probability of any member of a joint distribution can be calculated from conditional probabilities using the chain rule (given a topological ordering of &quot;X&quot;) as follows:

: formula_53

Using the definition above, this can be written as:

: formula_54

The difference between the two expressions is the conditional independence of the variables from any of their non-descendants, given the values of their parent variables.

===Local Markov property===
&quot;X&quot; is a Bayesian network with respect to &quot;G&quot; if it satisfies the &quot;local Markov property&quot;: each variable is conditionally independent of its non-descendants given its parent variables:

:formula_55

where de(&quot;v&quot;) is the set of descendants and &quot;V&quot; \ de(&quot;v&quot;) is the set of non-descendants of &quot;v&quot;.

This can be expressed in terms similar to the first definition, as

:formula_56

The set of parents is a subset of the set of non-descendants because the graph is acyclic.

===Marginal independence structure===
In general, learning a Bayesian network from data is known to be NP-hard. This is due in part to the combinatorial explosion of enumerating DAGs as the number of variables increases. Nevertheless, insights about an underlying Bayesian network can be learned from data in polynomial time by focusing on its marginal independence structure: while the conditional independence statements of a distribution modeled by a Bayesian network are encoded by a DAG (according to the factorization and Markov properties above), its marginal independence statements—the conditional independence statements in which the conditioning set is empty—are encoded by a simple undirected graph with special properties such as equal intersection and independence numbers.

===Developing Bayesian networks===
Developing a Bayesian network often begins with creating a DAG &quot;G&quot; such that &quot;X&quot; satisfies the local Markov property with respect to &quot;G&quot;. Sometimes this is a causal DAG. The conditional probability distributions of each variable given its parents in &quot;G&quot; are assessed. In many cases, in particular in the case where the variables are discrete, if the joint distribution of &quot;X&quot; is the product of these conditional distributions, then &quot;X&quot; is a Bayesian network with respect to &quot;G&quot;.

===Markov blanket===
The Markov blanket of a node is the set of nodes consisting of its parents, its children, and any other parents of its children. The Markov blanket renders the node independent of the rest of the network; the joint distribution of the variables in the Markov blanket of a node is sufficient knowledge for calculating the distribution of the node. &quot;X&quot; is a Bayesian network with respect to &quot;G&quot; if every node is conditionally independent of all other nodes in the network, given its Markov blanket.

====&quot;d&quot;-separation====

This definition can be made more general by defining the &quot;d&quot;-separation of two nodes, where d stands for directional. We first define the &quot;d&quot;-separation of a trail and then we will define the &quot;d&quot;-separation of two nodes in terms of that.

Let &quot;P&quot; be a trail from node &quot;u&quot; to &quot;v&quot;. A trail is a loop-free, undirected (i.e. all edge directions are ignored) path between two nodes. Then &quot;P&quot; is said to be &quot;d&quot;-separated by a set of nodes &quot;Z&quot; if any of the following conditions holds:

*&quot;P&quot; contains (but does not need to be entirely) a directed chain, formula_57 or formula_58, such that the middle node &quot;m&quot; is in &quot;Z&quot;,
*&quot;P&quot; contains a fork, formula_59, such that the middle node &quot;m&quot; is in &quot;Z&quot;, or
*&quot;P&quot; contains an inverted fork (or collider), formula_60, such that the middle node &quot;m&quot; is not in &quot;Z&quot; and no descendant of &quot;m&quot; is in &quot;Z&quot;.

The nodes &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are &quot;d&quot;-separated by &quot;Z&quot; if all trails between them are &quot;d&quot;-separated. If &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are not d-separated, they are d-connected.

&quot;X&quot; is a Bayesian network with respect to &quot;G&quot; if, for any two nodes &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;:

: formula_61

where &quot;Z&quot; is a set which &quot;d&quot;-separates &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot;. (The Markov blanket is the minimal set of nodes which &quot;d&quot;-separates node &quot;v&quot; from all other nodes.)

===Causal networks===
Although Bayesian networks are often used to represent causal relationships, this need not be the case: a directed edge from &quot;u&quot; to &quot;v&quot; does not require that &quot;Xv&quot; be causally dependent on &quot;Xu&quot;. This is demonstrated by the fact that Bayesian networks on the graphs:

:formula_62

are equivalent: that is they impose exactly the same conditional independence requirements.

A causal network is a Bayesian network with the requirement that the relationships be causal. The additional semantics of causal networks specify that if a node &quot;X&quot; is actively caused to be in a given state &quot;x&quot; (an action written as do(&quot;X&quot; = &quot;x&quot;)), then the probability density function changes to that of the network obtained by cutting the links from the parents of &quot;X&quot; to &quot;X&quot;, and setting &quot;X&quot; to the caused value &quot;x&quot;. Using these semantics, the impact of external interventions from data obtained prior to intervention can be predicted.

==Inference complexity and approximation algorithms==
In 1990, while working at Stanford University on large bioinformatic applications, Cooper proved that exact inference in Bayesian networks is NP-hard. This result prompted research on approximation algorithms with the aim of developing a tractable approximation to probabilistic inference. In 1993, Paul Dagum and Michael Luby proved two surprising results on the complexity of approximation of probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks. First, they proved that no tractable deterministic algorithm can approximate probabilistic inference to within an absolute error &quot;ɛ&quot; &lt; 1/2. Second, they proved that no tractable randomized algorithm can approximate probabilistic inference to within an absolute error &quot;ɛ&quot; &lt; 1/2 with confidence probability greater than 1/2.

At about the same time, Roth proved that exact inference in Bayesian networks is in fact #P-complete (and thus as hard as counting the number of satisfying assignments of a conjunctive normal form formula (CNF)) and that approximate inference within a factor 2&quot;n&quot;1−&quot;ɛ&quot; for every &quot;ɛ&quot; &gt; 0, even for Bayesian networks with restricted architecture, is NP-hard.

In practical terms, these complexity results suggested that while Bayesian networks were rich representations for AI and machine learning applications, their use in large real-world applications would need to be tempered by either topological structural constraints, such as naïve Bayes networks, or by restrictions on the conditional probabilities. The bounded variance algorithm developed by Dagum and Luby was the first provable fast approximation algorithm to efficiently approximate probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks with guarantees on the error approximation. This powerful algorithm required the minor restriction on the conditional probabilities of the Bayesian network to be bounded away from zero and one by formula_63 where formula_64 was any polynomial of the number of nodes in the network, formula_65.

==Software==

Notable software for Bayesian networks include:
* Just another Gibbs sampler (JAGS) – Open-source alternative to WinBUGS. Uses Gibbs sampling.
* OpenBUGS – Open-source development of WinBUGS.
* SPSS Modeler – Commercial software that includes an implementation for Bayesian networks.
* Stan (software) – Stan is an open-source package for obtaining Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS), a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.
* PyMC – A Python library implementing an embedded domain specific language to represent bayesian networks, and a variety of samplers (including NUTS)
* WinBUGS – One of the first computational implementations of MCMC samplers. No longer maintained.

==History==
The term Bayesian network was coined by Judea Pearl in 1985 to emphasize:

*the often subjective nature of the input information
*the reliance on Bayes&#x27; conditioning as the basis for updating information
*the distinction between causal and evidential modes of reasoning

In the late 1980s Pearl&#x27;s &quot;Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems&quot; and Neapolitan&#x27;s &quot;Probabilistic Reasoning in Expert Systems&quot; summarized their properties and established them as a field of study.

<text>In mathematics, particularly graph theory, and computer science, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a directed graph with no directed cycles. That is, it consists of vertices and edges (also called &quot;arcs&quot;), with each edge directed from one vertex to another, such that following those directions will never form a closed loop. A directed graph is a DAG if and only if it can be topologically ordered, by arranging the vertices as a linear ordering that is consistent with all edge directions. DAGs have numerous scientific and computational applications, ranging from biology (evolution, family trees, epidemiology) to information science (citation networks) to computation (scheduling).

Directed acyclic graphs are also called acyclic directed graphs or acyclic digraphs.

== Definitions ==
A graph is formed by vertices and by edges connecting pairs of vertices, where the vertices can be any kind of object that is connected in pairs by edges. In the case of a directed graph, each edge has an orientation, from one vertex to another vertex. A path in a directed graph is a sequence of edges having the property that the ending vertex of each edge in the sequence is the same as the starting vertex of the next edge in the sequence; a path forms a cycle if the starting vertex of its first edge equals the ending vertex of its last edge. A directed acyclic graph is a directed graph that has no cycles.

A vertex of a directed graph is said to be reachable from another vertex when there exists a path that starts at and ends at . As a special case, every vertex is considered to be reachable from itself (by a path with zero edges). If a vertex can reach itself via a nontrivial path (a path with one or more edges), then that path is a cycle, so another way to define directed acyclic graphs is that they are the graphs in which no vertex can reach itself via a nontrivial path.

=== Reachability relation, transitive closure, and transitive reduction ===

The reachability relation of a DAG can be formalized as a partial order on the vertices of the DAG. In this partial order, two vertices and are ordered as exactly when there exists a directed path from to in the DAG; that is, when can reach (or is reachable from ). However, different DAGs may give rise to the same reachability relation and the same partial order. For example, a DAG with two edges and has the same reachability relation as the DAG with three edges , , and . Both of these DAGs produce the same partial order, in which the vertices are ordered as .

The transitive closure of a DAG is the graph with the most edges that has the same reachability relation as the DAG. It has an edge for every pair of vertices (, ) in the reachability relation of the DAG, and may therefore be thought of as a direct translation of the reachability relation into graph-theoretic terms. The same method of translating partial orders into DAGs works more generally: for every finite partially ordered set , the graph that has a vertex for every element of and an edge for every pair of elements in is automatically a transitively closed DAG, and has as its reachability relation. In this way, every finite partially ordered set can be represented as a DAG.
The transitive reduction of a DAG is the graph with the fewest edges that has the same reachability relation as the DAG. It has an edge for every pair of vertices (, ) in the covering relation of the reachability relation of the DAG. It is a subgraph of the DAG, formed by discarding the edges for which the DAG also contains a longer directed path from to .
Like the transitive closure, the transitive reduction is uniquely defined for DAGs. In contrast, for a directed graph that is not acyclic, there can be more than one minimal subgraph with the same reachability relation. Transitive reductions are useful in visualizing the partial orders they represent, because they have fewer edges than other graphs representing the same orders and therefore lead to simpler graph drawings. A Hasse diagram of a partial order is a drawing of the transitive reduction in which the orientation of every edge is shown by placing the starting vertex of the edge in a lower position than its ending vertex.

=== Topological ordering ===
A topological ordering of a directed graph is an ordering of its vertices into a sequence, such that for every edge the start vertex of the edge occurs earlier in the sequence than the ending vertex of the edge. A graph that has a topological ordering cannot have any cycles, because the edge into the earliest vertex of a cycle would have to be oriented the wrong way. Therefore, every graph with a topological ordering is acyclic. Conversely, every directed acyclic graph has at least one topological ordering. The existence of a topological ordering can therefore be used as an equivalent definition of a directed acyclic graphs: they are exactly the graphs that have topological orderings.
In general, this ordering is not unique; a DAG has a unique topological ordering if and only if it has a directed path containing all the vertices, in which case the ordering is the same as the order in which the vertices appear in the path.

The family of topological orderings of a DAG is the same as the family of linear extensions of the reachability relation for the DAG, so any two graphs representing the same partial order have the same set of topological orders.

=== Combinatorial enumeration ===
The graph enumeration problem of counting directed acyclic graphs was studied by .
The number of DAGs on labeled vertices, for (without restrictions on the order in which these numbers appear in a topological ordering of the DAG) is
:1, 1, 3, 25, 543, 29281, 3781503, … .
These numbers may be computed by the recurrence relation
:formula_1
Eric W. Weisstein conjectured, and proved, that the same numbers count the (0,1) matrices for which all eigenvalues are positive real numbers. The proof is bijective: a matrix is an adjacency matrix of a DAG if and only if is a (0,1) matrix with all eigenvalues positive, where denotes the identity matrix. Because a DAG cannot have self-loops, its adjacency matrix must have a zero diagonal, so adding preserves the property that all matrix coefficients are 0 or 1.

=== Related families of graphs ===

A &quot;multitree&quot; (also called a &quot;strongly unambiguous graph&quot; or a &quot;mangrove&quot;) is a DAG in which there is at most one directed path between any two vertices. Equivalently, it is a DAG in which the subgraph reachable from any vertex induces an undirected tree.

A &quot;polytree&quot; (also called a &quot;directed tree&quot;) is a multitree formed by orienting the edges of an undirected tree.

An &quot;arborescence&quot; is a polytree formed by orienting the edges of an undirected tree away from a particular vertex, called the &quot;root&quot; of the arborescence.

== Computational problems ==
=== Topological sorting and recognition ===

Topological sorting is the algorithmic problem of finding a topological ordering of a given DAG. It can be solved in linear time. Kahn&#x27;s algorithm for topological sorting builds the vertex ordering directly. It maintains a list of vertices that have no incoming edges from other vertices that have not already been included in the partially constructed topological ordering; initially this list consists of the vertices with no incoming edges at all. Then, it repeatedly adds one vertex from this list to the end of the partially constructed topological ordering, and checks whether its neighbors should be added to the list. The algorithm terminates when all vertices have been processed in this way. Alternatively, a topological ordering may be constructed by reversing a postorder numbering of a depth-first search graph traversal.

It is also possible to check whether a given directed graph is a DAG in linear time, either by attempting to find a topological ordering and then testing for each edge whether the resulting ordering is valid or alternatively, for some topological sorting algorithms, by verifying that the algorithm successfully orders all the vertices without meeting an error condition.

=== Construction from cyclic graphs ===
Any undirected graph may be made into a DAG by choosing a total order for its vertices and directing every edge from the earlier endpoint in the order to the later endpoint. The resulting orientation of the edges is called an acyclic orientation. Different total orders may lead to the same acyclic orientation, so an -vertex graph can have fewer than acyclic orientations. The number of acyclic orientations is equal to , where is the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.
Any directed graph may be made into a DAG by removing a feedback vertex set or a feedback arc set, a set of vertices or edges (respectively) that touches all cycles. However, the smallest such set is NP-hard to find. An arbitrary directed graph may also be transformed into a DAG, called its condensation, by contracting each of its strongly connected components into a single supervertex. When the graph is already acyclic, its smallest feedback vertex sets and feedback arc sets are empty, and its condensation is the graph itself.

=== Transitive closure and transitive reduction ===
The transitive closure of a given DAG, with vertices and edges, may be constructed in time by using either breadth-first search or depth-first search to test reachability from each vertex. Alternatively, it can be solved in time where is the exponent for matrix multiplication algorithms; this is a theoretical improvement over the bound for dense graphs.

In all of these transitive closure algorithms, it is possible to distinguish pairs of vertices that are reachable by at least one path of length two or more from pairs that can only be connected by a length-one path. The transitive reduction consists of the edges that form length-one paths that are the only paths connecting their endpoints. Therefore, the transitive reduction can be constructed in the same asymptotic time bounds as the transitive closure.

=== Closure problem ===

The closure problem takes as input a vertex-weighted directed acyclic graph and seeks the minimum (or maximum) weight of a closure – a set of vertices &quot;C&quot;, such that no edges leave &quot;C&quot;. The problem may be formulated for directed graphs without the assumption of acyclicity, but with no greater generality, because in this case it is equivalent to the same problem on the condensation of the graph. It may be solved in polynomial time using a reduction to the maximum flow problem.

=== Path algorithms ===
Some algorithms become simpler when used on DAGs instead of general graphs, based on the principle of topological ordering. For example, it is possible to find shortest paths and longest paths from a given starting vertex in DAGs in linear time by processing the vertices in a topological order, and calculating the path length for each vertex to be the minimum or maximum length obtained via any of its incoming edges. In contrast, for arbitrary graphs the shortest path may require slower algorithms such as Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm or the Bellman–Ford algorithm, and longest paths in arbitrary graphs are NP-hard to find.

== Applications ==
=== Scheduling ===
Directed acyclic graph representations of partial orderings have many applications in scheduling for systems of tasks with ordering constraints.
An important class of problems of this type concern collections of objects that need to be updated, such as the cells of a spreadsheet after one of the cells has been changed, or the object files of a piece of computer software after its source code has been changed.
In this context, a dependency graph is a graph that has a vertex for each object to be updated, and an edge connecting two objects whenever one of them needs to be updated earlier than the other. A cycle in this graph is called a circular dependency, and is generally not allowed, because there would be no way to consistently schedule the tasks involved in the cycle.
Dependency graphs without circular dependencies form DAGs.

For instance, when one cell of a spreadsheet changes, it is necessary to recalculate the values of other cells that depend directly or indirectly on the changed cell. For this problem, the tasks to be scheduled are the recalculations of the values of individual cells of the spreadsheet. Dependencies arise when an expression in one cell uses a value from another cell. In such a case, the value that is used must be recalculated earlier than the expression that uses it. Topologically ordering the dependency graph, and using this topological order to schedule the cell updates, allows the whole spreadsheet to be updated with only a single evaluation per cell. Similar problems of task ordering arise in makefiles for program compilation and instruction scheduling for low-level computer program optimization.
A somewhat different DAG-based formulation of scheduling constraints is used by the program evaluation and review technique (PERT), a method for management of large human projects that was one of the first applications of DAGs. In this method, the vertices of a DAG represent milestones of a project rather than specific tasks to be performed. Instead, a task or activity is represented by an edge of a DAG, connecting two milestones that mark the beginning and completion of the task. Each such edge is labeled with an estimate for the amount of time that it will take a team of workers to perform the task. The longest path in this DAG represents the critical path of the project, the one that controls the total time for the project. Individual milestones can be scheduled according to the lengths of the longest paths ending at their vertices.

=== Data processing networks ===
A directed acyclic graph may be used to represent a network of processing elements. In this representation, data enters a processing element through its incoming edges and leaves the element through its outgoing edges.

For instance, in electronic circuit design, static combinational logic blocks can be represented as an acyclic system of logic gates that computes a function of an input, where the input and output of the function are represented as individual bits. In general, the output of these blocks cannot be used as the input unless it is captured by a register or state element which maintains its acyclic properties. Electronic circuit schematics either on paper or in a database are a form of directed acyclic graphs using instances or components to form a directed reference to a lower level component. Electronic circuits themselves are not necessarily acyclic or directed.

Dataflow programming languages describe systems of operations on data streams, and the connections between the outputs of some operations and the inputs of others. These languages can be convenient for describing repetitive data processing tasks, in which the same acyclically-connected collection of operations is applied to many data items. They can be executed as a parallel algorithm in which each operation is performed by a parallel process as soon as another set of inputs becomes available to it.

In compilers, straight line code (that is, sequences of statements without loops or conditional branches) may be represented by a DAG describing the inputs and outputs of each of the arithmetic operations performed within the code. This representation allows the compiler to perform common subexpression elimination efficiently. At a higher level of code organization, the acyclic dependencies principle states that the dependencies between modules or components of a large software system should form a directed acyclic graph.

Feedforward neural networks are another example.

=== Causal structures ===

Graphs in which vertices represent events occurring at a definite time, and where the edges always point from the early time vertex to a late time vertex of the edge, are necessarily directed and acyclic. The lack of a cycle follows because the time associated with a vertex always increases as you follow any path in the graph so you can never return to a vertex on a path. This reflects our natural intuition that causality means events can only affect the future, they never affect the past, and thus we have no causal loops. An example of this type of directed acyclic graph are those encountered in the causal set approach to quantum gravity though in this case the graphs considered are transitively complete. In the version history example below, each version of the software is associated with a unique time, typically the time the version was saved, committed or released. In the citation graph examples below, the documents are published at one time and can only refer to older documents.

Sometimes events are not associated with a specific physical time. Provided that pairs of events have a purely causal relationship, that is edges represent causal relations between the events, we will have a directed acyclic graph. For instance, a Bayesian network represents a system of probabilistic events as vertices in a directed acyclic graph, in which the likelihood of an event may be calculated from the likelihoods of its predecessors in the DAG. In this context, the moral graph of a DAG is the undirected graph created by adding an (undirected) edge between all parents of the same vertex (sometimes called &quot;marrying&quot;), and then replacing all directed edges by undirected edges. Another type of graph with a similar causal structure is an influence diagram, the vertices of which represent either decisions to be made or unknown information, and the edges of which represent causal influences from one vertex to another. In epidemiology, for instance, these diagrams are often used to estimate the expected value of different choices for intervention.

The converse is also true. That is in any application represented by a directed acyclic graph there is a causal structure, either an explicit order or time in the example or an order which can be derived from graph structure. This follows because all directed acyclic graphs have a topological ordering, i.e. there is at least one way to put the vertices in an order such that all edges point in the same direction along that order.

=== Genealogy and version history ===

Family trees may be seen as directed acyclic graphs, with a vertex for each family member and an edge for each parent-child relationship. Despite the name, these graphs are not necessarily trees because of the possibility of marriages between relatives (so a child has a common ancestor on both the mother&#x27;s and father&#x27;s side) causing pedigree collapse. The graphs of matrilineal descent (mother-daughter relationships) and patrilineal descent (father-son relationships) are trees within this graph. Because no one can become their own ancestor, family trees are acyclic.

The version history of a distributed revision control system, such as Git, generally has the structure of a directed acyclic graph, in which there is a vertex for each revision and an edge connecting pairs of revisions that were directly derived from each other. These are not trees in general due to merges.

In many randomized algorithms in computational geometry, the algorithm maintains a &quot;history DAG&quot; representing the version history of a geometric structure over the course of a sequence of changes to the structure. For instance in a randomized incremental algorithm for Delaunay triangulation, the triangulation changes by replacing one triangle by three smaller triangles when each point is added, and by &quot;flip&quot; operations that replace pairs of triangles by a different pair of triangles. The history DAG for this algorithm has a vertex for each triangle constructed as part of the algorithm, and edges from each triangle to the two or three other triangles that replace it. This structure allows point location queries to be answered efficiently: to find the location of a query point in the Delaunay triangulation, follow a path in the history DAG, at each step moving to the replacement triangle that contains . The final triangle reached in this path must be the Delaunay triangle that contains .

=== Citation graphs ===
In a citation graph the vertices are documents with a single publication date. The edges represent the citations from the bibliography of one document to other necessarily earlier documents. The classic example comes from the citations between academic papers as pointed out in the 1965 article &quot;Networks of Scientific Papers&quot; by Derek J. de Solla Price who went on to produce the first model of a citation network, the Price model. In this case the citation count of a paper is just the in-degree of the corresponding vertex of the citation network. This is an important measure in citation analysis. Court judgements provide another example as judges support their conclusions in one case by recalling other earlier decisions made in previous cases. A final example is provided by patents which must refer to earlier prior art, earlier patents which are relevant to the current patent claim. By taking the special properties of directed acyclic graphs into account, one can analyse citation networks with techniques not available when analysing the general graphs considered in many studies using network analysis. For instance transitive reduction gives new insights into the citation distributions found in different applications highlighting clear differences in the mechanisms creating citations networks in different contexts. Another technique is main path analysis, which traces the citation links and suggests the most significant citation chains in a given citation graph.

The Price model is too simple to be a realistic model of a citation network but it is simple enough to allow for analytic solutions for some of its properties. Many of these can be found by using results derived from the undirected version of the Price model, the Barabási–Albert model. However, since Price&#x27;s model gives a directed acyclic graph, it is a useful model when looking for analytic calculations of properties unique to directed acyclic graphs. For instance,
the length of the longest path, from the n-th node added to the network to the first node in the network, scales as formula_2.

=== Data compression ===
Directed acyclic graphs may also be used as a compact representation of a collection of sequences. In this type of application, one finds a DAG in which the paths form the given sequences. When many of the sequences share the same subsequences, these shared subsequences can be represented by a shared part of the DAG, allowing the representation to use less space than it would take to list out all of the sequences separately. For example, the directed acyclic word graph is a data structure in computer science formed by a directed acyclic graph with a single source and with edges labeled by letters or symbols; the paths from the source to the sinks in this graph represent a set of strings, such as English words. Any set of sequences can be represented as paths in a tree, by forming a tree vertex for every prefix of a sequence and making the parent of one of these vertices represent the sequence with one fewer element; the tree formed in this way for a set of strings is called a trie. A directed acyclic word graph saves space over a trie by allowing paths to diverge and rejoin, so that a set of words with the same possible suffixes can be represented by a single tree vertex.

The same idea of using a DAG to represent a family of paths occurs in the binary decision diagram, a DAG-based data structure for representing binary functions. In a binary decision diagram, each non-sink vertex is labeled by the name of a binary variable, and each sink and each edge is labeled by a 0 or 1. The function value for any truth assignment to the variables is the value at the sink found by following a path, starting from the single source vertex, that at each non-sink vertex follows the outgoing edge labeled with the value of that vertex&#x27;s variable. Just as directed acyclic word graphs can be viewed as a compressed form of , binary decision diagrams can be viewed as compressed forms of decision trees that save space by allowing paths to rejoin when they agree on the results of all remaining decisions.

<text>Near passerines and higher land-bird assemblage are terms of traditional, pre-cladistic taxonomy that have often been given to tree-dwelling birds or those most often believed to be related to the true passerines (order Passeriformes) owing to morphological and ecological similarities; the group corresponds to some extent with the Anomalogonatae of Alfred Henry Garrod.

==Biology==
All near passerines are land birds. However, molecular data does not support the traditional arrangement; it is now clear that &quot;near passerines&quot; and &quot;higher landbirds&quot; are not synonymous.

Per Ericson and colleagues, analyzing genomic DNA revealed a lineage comprising Passeriformes, Psittaciformes and Falconiformes.

==Orders==

Pterocliformes (sandgrouse), Columbiformes (pigeons), Cuculiformes (cuckoos), Caprimulgiformes (nightjars), and Apodiformes (swifts, hummingbirds) are no longer recognized as near passerines. The true near-passerine families are the Psittaciformes (parrots), the Falconiformes (falcons), and the Cariamiformes (seriemas). These three orders, together with the Passeriformes make up the Australaves. Sister to the Australaves are the Afroaves (see Telluraves).

The phylogenetic relationships between the orders are:

<text>Notting Hill is a 1999 romantic comedy film directed by Roger Michell. The screenplay was written by Richard Curtis, and the film was produced by Duncan Kenworthy. It stars Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, with Rhys Ifans, Emma Chambers, Tim McInnerny, Gina McKee, and Hugh Bonneville in supporting roles. The story is of a romance between a British bookshop keeper (Grant) and a famous American actress (Roberts) who happens to walk into his shop in London&#x27;s Notting Hill district.

Released on 21 May 1999, &quot;Notting Hill&quot; was well received by critics and was the highest-grossing British film of all time. At the 57th Golden Globe Awards, the film received three nominations – Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (Roberts) and Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (Grant). It also earned two BAFTA nominations, and won a British Comedy Award and a Brit Award for its soundtrack.

==Plot==
William Thacker owns a travel book store in Notting Hill, London. Divorced from his wife who left him for another man, he shares a flat with Spike, a flaky and sloppy Welshman. 

One day, famous Hollywood actress Anna Scott enters the shop and buys a book. Shortly after she leaves, Will goes to buy his colleague Martin a juice, but bumps into Anna while rounding a street corner, spilling it on her. He takes her to his flat across the street so she can change. When leaving, she impulsively kisses him.

Anna later invites Will to visit her at the Ritz Hotel. Upon his arrival, he is mistaken for a reporter and ushered into a press event for her new film. When asked, Will says he writes for &quot;Horse &amp; Hound&quot; magazine. Anna asks to be William&#x27;s date at his sister Honey&#x27;s birthday party later that evening. Though his friends and family are surprised, she gets on well with everyone and enjoys herself. Later, the two enter a private neighbourhood park, where Anna again kisses Will.

At a restaurant the next day, Will and Anna overhear a party of men at a nearby table discussing her, first praising and then disparaging her and equating actresses to prostitutes. He confronts them, then she introduces herself and calmly insults the stunned men.

Anna invites Will to her hotel room, but after discovering that her movie star boyfriend, Jeff, has unexpectedly arrived from America, he leaves. Over the next six months, Will&#x27;s friends Max, Bella, Bernie and Tony arrange a series of dates for him, but Will, heartsick over Anna, is uninterested in another relationship.

One day, a distraught Anna appears at Will&#x27;s doorstep, needing to hide due to a tabloid scandal. She apologises about Jeff and says their relationship is over. They discover shared interests, and discuss Will&#x27;s print of Marc Chagall&#x27;s 1950 painting , with Anna saying it shows &quot;how love should be&quot; and that &quot;happiness isn’t happiness without a violin-playing goat&quot; as depicted in the painting. They make love that night. The next morning paparazzi, inadvertently tipped off by Spike, besiege the house and take photos of Will, Anna, and a half-dressed Spike at the front door. Furious, she blames Will and leaves.

Several seasons pass, and Will remains miserable. When he discovers Anna is back in London making a film based on a Henry James novel, something he had suggested, he visits the set unannounced. She asks him to wait until shooting is done, but he leaves after overhearing her being dismissive about him to another actor. 

Anna comes to the bookshop the next day, bringing a wrapped gift. Will says he overheard what she said about him to her co-star. Anna explains that she was merely trying to keep her personal life private. She proclaims that she loves him, and pleads to rekindle their relationship. Will says no, explaining that he would not recover if she left him again.

Will meets his friends and sister at a restaurant with Anna&#x27;s partly opened gift: Chagall&#x27;s original &quot;La Mariée&quot; (&quot;The Bride&quot;). They halfheartedly support his decision about Anna until Spike arrives and calls him a &quot;daft prick&quot;. Will admits his mistake, and everyone races across London to find Anna, who is holding a press conference at the Savoy Hotel. They arrive just as her publicist announces that Anna is taking a year off and is leaving the UK that night.

A reporter asks about the embarrassing photographs taken at Will&#x27;s flat, and Anna says they are just friends. Will asks her if she would consider being more than friends if he begs her forgiveness. She says she would, then requests that the reporter repeat his question, &quot;How long are you intending to stay here in Britain?&quot; Smiling, she answers &quot;Indefinitely&quot;.

Anna and Will marry, their wedding cake featuring the violin-playing goat from &quot;La Mariée&quot;. Spike and Honey also marry. Anna is pregnant as she and Will spend time in the private park that they visited on their first date.

Casting notes
* Julia Roberts was the &quot;one and only&quot; choice for the role of Anna Scott, although Roger Michell and Duncan Kenworthy did not expect her to accept. Her agent told her it was &quot;the best romantic comedy she had ever read&quot;. Roberts said that after reading the script she decided she was &quot;going to have to do this&quot;.
* The decision to cast Hugh Grant as William Thacker was unanimous, as he and Richard Curtis had a &quot;writer/actor marriage made in heaven&quot;. Michell said that &quot;Hugh does Richard better than anyone else, and Richard writes Hugh better than anyone else&quot;, and that Grant is &quot;one of the only actors who can speak Richard&#x27;s lines perfectly&quot;.
* Mischa Barton appears as the child actor whom Will interviews for &quot;Horse &amp; Hound&quot;.
* The casting of Bonneville, McInnerny, McKee, Chambers, and Ifans as Will&#x27;s friends was &quot;rather like assembling a family&quot;. Michell explained, &quot;When you are casting a cabal of friends, you have to cast a balance of qualities, of types and of sensibilities. They were the jigsaw that had to be put together all in one go, and I think we&#x27;ve got a very good variety of people who can realistically still live in the same world.&quot;
* Sanjeev Bhaskar has a cameo role as a loud and offensive restaurant patron (who refers to Meg Ryan as &quot;the actress who has an orgasm every time she&#x27;s taken out for a cup of coffee&quot;) in the restaurant Anna and Will visit.
* Omid Djalili makes an uncredited cameo as the vendor who sells Will the orange juice that Will accidentally spills on Anna moments later.
* Science fiction author China Miéville was cast as an extra in the film, which he humorously described as a dystopian alternative history of an ethnically-cleansed city.

==Production==

Richard Curtis developed the film from thoughts while lying awake at night. He described the starting point as &quot;the idea of a very normal person going out with an unbelievably famous person and how that impinges on their lives&quot;. In an interview with &quot;GQ&quot; in 2018, Hugh Grant claimed the film was based on real life and loosely followed a friend of Richard&#x27;s who fell in love with an &#x27;extremely world-famous person who [Grant wasn&#x27;t] allowed to mention&#x27;. Much like the film, Curtis&#x27;s friend was an everyday person who met the well known celebrity in a shop (Harrods) and they ended up having a relationship.

The film has been likened to &quot;a 90&#x27;s London-set version of &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;&quot;. However, Curtis has said that he had not seen the 1953 film.

&quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; director Mike Newell was approached but rejected it to work on &quot;Pushing Tin&quot;. He said that in commercial terms he had made the wrong decision, but did not regret it. The producer, Duncan Kenworthy, then turned to Roger Michell, saying that &quot;Finding someone as good as Roger, was just like finding the right actor to play each role. Roger shone out.&quot;

Roberts originally didn&#x27;t want to play the role as she thought the pitch sounded terrible.

Curtis chose Notting Hill as he lived there and knew the area, saying &quot;Notting Hill is a melting pot and the perfect place to set a film&quot;. This left the producers to film in a heavily populated area. Kenworthy noted &quot;Early on, we toyed with the idea of building a huge exterior set. That way we would have more control, because we were worried about having Roberts and Grant on public streets where we could get thousands of onlookers.&quot; In the end they decided to film in the streets. Michell was worried &quot;that Hugh and Julia were going to turn up on the first day of shooting on Portobello Road, and there would be gridlock and we would be surrounded by thousands of people and paparazzi photographers who would prevent us from shooting&quot;. The location team and security personnel prevented this, as well as preventing problems the presence of a film crew might have caused the residents of Notting Hill, who Michell believes were &quot;genuinely excited&quot; about the film. Location manager Sue Quinn described finding locations and getting permission to film as &quot;a mammoth task&quot;. Quinn and the rest of her team had to write to thousands of people in the area, promising to donate to each person&#x27;s favourite charity, resulting in 200 charities receiving money.
Stuart Craig, the production designer, was pleased to do a contemporary film, saying, &quot;We&#x27;re dealing with streets with thousands of people, market traders, shop owners and residents, which makes it really complex&quot;. Filming began on 17 April 1998 in West London and at Shepperton Studios. Will&#x27;s bookshop was on Portobello Road, one of the main areas where filming took place. Other locations in Notting Hill included Westbourne Park Road, Golborne Road, Landsdowne Road and the Coronet Cinema. Will&#x27;s house, 280 Westbourne Park Road, was owned by Richard Curtis and behind the entrance there is a grand house, not the flat in the film that was made up in the studios. The blue door was auctioned for charity. The current door is blue again. The Travel Book Store is located at 142 Portobello Road. After filming for six weeks in Notting Hill, filming moved to the Ritz Hotel, where it had to take place at night. Other locations were Savoy Hotel, the Nobu Restaurant, the Zen Garden of the Hempel Hotel, and Kenwood House.

One of the final scenes takes place at a film premiere, which presented difficulties. Michell wanted to film at Leicester Square but was declined. Police had found fans at a Leonardo DiCaprio premiere problematic and were concerned the same might occur at the staged premiere. Through a health and safety act, the production received permission to film and constructed the scene in 24 hours. Interior scenes were the last to be filmed, at Shepperton Studios.

The final cut was 3.5 hours long; 90 minutes were edited out for release.

The film features the 1950 Marc Chagall painting (&quot;The Bride&quot;). Anna sees a print of the painting in William&#x27;s home and later gives him the original. Michell said in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that the painting was chosen because Curtis was a fan of Chagall&#x27;s work and because &quot;depicts a yearning for something that&#x27;s lost.&quot; The producers had a reproduction made for the film, created by British artist Thomasina Smith, but first had to get permission from the owner as well as clearance from the Design and Artists Copyright Society. Finally, according to Kenworthy, &quot;we had to agree to destroy it. They were concerned that if our fake was too good, it might float around the market and create problems.&quot; 

The film features the book &quot;Istanbul: The Imperial City&quot; (1996) by John Freely. William recommends this book to Anna, commenting that (unlike another book in the store) the author has at least been to Istanbul. Indeed, Freely taught at Boğaziçi University in Istanbul and was the author of nine books about the city.

==Soundtrack==

Original music was composed by Trevor Jones. A main score was written, and excerpts were used throughout the film. The score was broken down into two songs for the soundtrack (Will and Anna/Notting Hill). Several additional songs written by other artists include Elvis Costello&#x27;s cover of the Charles Aznavour song &quot;She&quot;. Charles Aznavour&#x27;s original version can be heard during the opening credits while Elvis Costello&#x27;s version is played at the end of the movie (before the end credits). Other songs are Shania Twain&#x27;s remixed version of &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Way&quot;, as well as Ronan Keating&#x27;s specially recorded cover of &quot;When You Say Nothing at All&quot;; the song reached number one in the British charts. Pulp recorded a new song &quot;Born to Cry&quot;, which was released on the European version of the soundtrack album.

The song played when Will strides down Portobello Road is &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine&quot; by Bill Withers. Tony and Bernie play &quot;Blue Moon&quot; on the piano at Tony&#x27;s restaurant on the night it closes. Originally, Charles Aznavour&#x27;s version of &quot;She&quot; was used in the film, but American test screening audiences did not respond to it. Costello was then brought in by Richard Curtis to record a cover version of the song. Both versions of the song appear in non-US releases.

The soundtrack album was released by Island Records.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Notting Hill&quot; received critical approval upon release. On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 84% based on 105 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;A rom-com with the right ingredients, &quot;Notting Hill&quot; proves there&#x27;s nothing like a love story well told—especially when Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts are your leads.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s Derek Elley said that &quot;It&#x27;s slick, it&#x27;s gawky, it&#x27;s 10 minutes too long, and it&#x27;s certainly not &quot;&quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; Part 2&quot; in either construction or overall tone&quot;, giving it an overall positive review. &quot;Cranky Critic&quot; called it &quot;Bloody damned good&quot;, as well as saying that it was &quot;A perfect date flick.&quot; &quot;Nitrate&quot; said that &quot;&quot;Notting Hill&quot; is whimsical and light, fresh and quirky&quot;, with &quot;endearing moments and memorable characters&quot;. In his review of the film&#x27;s DVD John J. Puccio writes, &quot;The movie is a fairy tale, and writer Richard Curtis knows how much the public loves a fairy tale&quot;, calling it &quot;a sweet film&quot;. Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave the film a very positive review, particularly praising Rhys Ifans&#x27; performance as Spike. James Sanford gave &quot;Notting Hill&quot; three and a half stars, saying that &quot;Curtis&#x27; dialogue may be much snappier than his sometimes dawdling plot, but the first hour of &quot;Notting Hill&quot; is so beguiling and consistently funny it seems churlish to complain that the rest is merely good.&quot; Sue Pierman of the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Notting Hill&quot; is clever, funny, romantic—and oh, yes, reminiscent of &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;&quot;, but that the film &quot;is so satisfying, it doesn&#x27;t pay to nitpick.&quot; Roger Ebert praised the film, saying &quot;The movie is bright, the dialogue has wit and intelligence, and Roberts and Grant are very easy to like.&quot; Kenneth Turan gave a good review, concluding that &quot;the film&#x27;s romantic core is impervious to problems&quot;. CNN reviewer Paul Clinton said that &quot;Notting Hill&quot; &quot;stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds&quot;.

Widgett Walls of Needcoffee.com gave the film &quot;three and a half cups of coffee&quot;, stating, &quot;The humor of the film saves it from a completely trite and unsatisfying (nay, shall I say enraging) ending&quot;, but criticising the soundtrack. Dennis Schwartz gave the film a negative review with a grade of &quot;C−&quot;, writing, &quot;This film was pure and unadulterated balderdash&quot;. Some criticised the film for giving a &quot;sweetened unrealistic view of London life and British eccentricity&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; derided the film as &quot;unrealistic&quot;. It was also criticised for failing to reflect the area&#x27;s demographic: &quot;Only Curtis could write a movie about Notting Hill, London&#x27;s most diverse borough, and not feature a single black face in it.&quot;

===Lists===
&quot;Notting Hill&quot; was 95th on the British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;list of the all-time top 100 films&quot;, based on estimates of each film&#x27;s British cinema admissions.

===Box office===
The film opened over the Memorial Day weekend in the United States and Canada, the same weekend as &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;, and opened at #2 for the four-day weekend, grossing US$27.7million, the biggest opening for a romantic comedy film, beating &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (which also starred Julia Roberts). It made another US$15million the following week. One month after its release, it lost its record for highest-grossing opening weekend for a romantic comedy film to &quot;Runaway Bride&quot; (again starring Roberts). &quot;Notting Hill&quot; grossed £31 million in the United Kingdom (the second highest-grossing film of 1999 behind &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;) and US$116,089,678 in the United States and Canada (the 16th highest-grossing film of 1999), with a worldwide gross of US$363,889,678, making it the highest-grossing British film of all time, surpassing the record set by &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; in 1994 (also starring Hugh Grant), and the seventh highest-grossing film of 1999.

===Awards and nominations===
&quot;Notting Hill&quot; won the Audience Award for Most Popular Film at the BAFTAs in 2000, and was nominated in the categories of The Alexander Korda Award for Outstanding British Film of the Year, and Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role for Rhys Ifans. It won Best Comedy Film at the British Comedy Awards. Its soundtrack won Best Soundtrack at the 2000 Brit Awards. It won Best British Film, Best British Director for Roger Michell, and Best British Actor for Hugh Grant at the Empire Awards.
It received three nominations at the Golden Globes, in the categories Best Motion Picture– Comedy/Musical, Best Motion Picture Actor– Comedy/Musical for Hugh Grant, and Best Motion Picture Actress– Comedy/Musical for Julia Roberts.

<text>Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi (; 25 January 1743 – 10 March 1819) was a German philosopher, writer and socialite. He is best known for popularizing the concept of nihilism. He promoted the idea that it is the necessary result of Enlightenment thought and the philosophical systems of Baruch Spinoza, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling.

Jacobi advocated &quot;Glaube&quot; (variously translated as faith or &quot;belief&quot;) and revelation instead of speculative reason. According to one view, Jacobi can be seen to have anticipated present-day writers who criticize secular philosophy as relativistic and dangerous for religious faith. His aloofness from the &quot;Sturm and Drang&quot; movement was the basis of a brief friendship with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. However, belief can also be understood in terms of a commonsense realism or as a proto-phenomenolgical approach to the given, aimed at avoiding the pitfalls of dogmatic foundationism on the one hand and a pure subjectivism on the other. These interpretative debates around Jacobi&#x27;s thought continue to this day. 

He was the younger brother of poet Johann Georg Jacobi and the father of the great psychiatrist Maximilian Jacobi.

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born at Düsseldorf, the second son of a wealthy sugar merchant, and was educated for a commercial career, which included a brief apprenticeship at a merchant house in Frankfurt-am-Main during 1759. Following, he was sent to Geneva for general education. Jacobi, of a retiring, meditative disposition, associated himself at Geneva mainly with the literary and scientific circle (of which the most prominent member was Georges-Louis Le Sage).

He studied closely the works of Charles Bonnet, as well as the political ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire. In 1763 he was recalled to Düsseldorf, and in the following year he married Elisbeth von Clermont and took over the management of his father&#x27;s business.

After a short time, he gave up his commercial career, and in 1770 he became a member of the council for the duchies of Jülich and Berg. He distinguished himself by his ability in financial affairs and his zeal in social reform. Jacobi kept up his interest in literary and philosophic matters by an extensive correspondence. His mansion at Pempelfort, near Düsseldorf, was the centre of a distinguished literary circle. He helped to found a new literary journal with Christoph Martin Wieland. Some of his earliest writings, mainly on practical or economic subjects, were published in &quot;Der Teutsche Merkur.&quot;

Here too appeared in part the first of his philosophic works, &quot;Edward Allwill&#x27;s Briefsammlung&quot; (1776), a combination of romance and speculation. This was followed in 1779 by &quot;Woldemar&quot;, a philosophic novel, of very imperfect structure, but full of genial ideas, and giving the most complete picture of Jacobi&#x27;s method of philosophizing.

In 1779, he visited Munich following his appointment as minister and privy councillor for the Bavarian department of customs and commerce. He opposed the mercantilistic policies of Bavaria and intended to liberalize local customs and taxes; but, after a short stay there, differences with his colleagues and with the authorities of Bavaria, as well as his unwillingness to engage in a power struggle, drove him back to Pempelfort. The experience as well as its aftermath led to the publication of two essays in which Jacobi defended Adam Smith&#x27;s theories of political economy. These essays were followed in 1785 by the work which first brought Jacobi into prominence as a philosopher.

===Pantheism controversy===
A conversation with Gotthold Lessing in 1780 in which Lessing avowed that he knew no philosophy in the true sense of that word, save Spinozism, led him to a protracted study of Spinoza&#x27;s works. After Lessing&#x27;s death, just a couple of months later, Jacobi continued to engage with Spinozism in an exchange of letters with Lessing&#x27;s close friend Moses Mendelssohn, which began in 1783. These letters, published with commentary by Jacobi as &quot;Briefe über die Lehre Spinozas&quot; (1785; 2nd ed., much enlarged and with important Appendices, 1789), expressed sharply and clearly Jacobi&#x27;s strenuous objection to a dogmatic system in philosophy, and drew upon him the vigorous enmity of the Aufklärer.

Jacobi was ridiculed for trying to reintroduce into philosophy the antiquated notion of unreasoning belief, was denounced as an enemy of reason, as a pietist, and as a Jesuit in disguise, and was especially attacked for his use of the ambiguous term &quot;belief&quot;. His next important work, &quot;David Hume über den Glauben, oder Idealismus und Realismus&quot; (1787), was an attempt to show not only that the term &quot;&quot; had been used by the most eminent writers to denote what he had employed it for in the &quot;Letters on Spinoza&quot;, but that the nature of the cognition of facts as opposed to the construction of inferences could not be otherwise expressed. In this writing, and especially in the Appendix, Jacobi came into contact with the critical philosophy, and subjected the Kantian view of knowledge to searching examination.

In 1787, Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi addressed, in his book On Faith, or Idealism and Realism, Kant&#x27;s concept of &quot;thing-in-itself.&quot; Jacobi agreed that the objective thing-in-itself cannot be directly known. However, he stated, it must be taken on faith. A subject must believe that there is a real object in the external world that is related to the representation or mental idea that is directly known. This faith or belief is a result of revelation or immediately known, but logically unproved, truth. The real existence of a thing-in-itself is revealed or disclosed to the observing subject. In this way, the subject directly knows the ideal, subjective representations that appear in the mind, and strongly believes in the real, objective thing-in-itself that exists outside of the mind. By presenting the external world as an object of faith, Jacobi legitimized belief and its theological associations. Schopenhauer would later state: &quot;…[B]y reducing the external world to a matter of faith, he wanted merely to open a little door for faith in general….&quot;

Ironically, the Pantheism Controversy led later German philosophers and writers to take an interest in pantheism and Spinozism. Jacobi&#x27;s fideism remained unpopular, and instead his critique of Enlightenment rationalism led more German philosophers to explore atheism and wrestle with the perceived loss of philosophical foundations for theism, myth, and morality. Jacobi and the Pantheism Controversy he ignited remain important in European intellectual history, because he formulated (albeit critically) one of the first systematic statements of nihilism and represents an early example of the death of God discourse.

===Later life===
The Pempelfort era came to an end in 1794 when the French Revolution spilled over into Germany following the outbreak of war with the French Republic. The occupation of Düsseldorf by French Troops forced him to resettle and for nearly ten years live in Holstein. There he became intimately acquainted with Karl Leonhard Reinhold (in whose Beitrage his important work, &quot;Uber das Unternehmen des Kriticismus, die Vernunft zu Verstande zu bringen&quot;, was first published), and with Matthias Claudius, the editor of the &quot;Wandsbecker Bote&quot;.

==== Atheism dispute ====

Gottlieb Fichte was dismissed from Jena in 1799 as a result of a charge of atheism. He was accused of this in 1798, after publishing his essay &quot;Ueber den Grund unsers Glaubens an eine göttliche Weltregierung&quot; (&quot;On the Ground of Our Belief in a Divine World-Governance&quot;), which he had written in response to Friedrich Karl Forberg&#x27;s essay &quot;Development of the Concept of Religion&quot;, in his &quot;Philosophical Journal&quot;. For Fichte, God should be conceived primarily in moral terms: &quot;The living and efficaciously acting moral order is itself God. We require no other God, nor can we grasp any other&quot; (&quot;On the Ground of Our Belief in a Divine World-Governance&quot;). Fichte&#x27;s intemperate &quot;Appeal to the Public&quot; (&quot;Appellation an das Publikum&quot;, 1799) as well as a more thoughtful response entitled “From a Private Letter” (1799), provoked F. H. Jacobi to publish &quot;Letter to Fichte&quot; (1799), in which he equated philosophy in general and Fichte&#x27;s transcendental philosophy in particular with nihilism and the relation of his own philosophic principles to theology.

==== President of Academy of sciences and retirement ====
Soon after his return to Germany, Jacobi received a call to Munich in connection with the new academy of sciences just founded there. The loss of a considerable portion of his fortune induced him to accept this offer; he settled in Munich in 1804, and in 1807 became president of the academy.

In 1811 appeared his last philosophic work, directed against Friedrich Schelling specially (&quot;Von den göttlichen Dingen und ihrer Offenbarung&quot;), the first part of which, a review of the &quot;Wandsbecker Bote&quot;, had been written in 1798. A bitter reply from Schelling was left without answer by Jacobi, but gave rise to an animated controversy in which Fries and Baader took prominent part.

In 1812 Jacobi retired from the office of president, and began to prepare a collected edition of his works. He died before this was completed. The edition of his writings was continued by his friend F. Koppen, and was completed in 1825. The works fill six volumes, of which the fourth is in three parts. To the second is prefixed an introduction by Jacobi, which is at the same time an introduction to his philosophy. The fourth volume has also an important preface.

==Philosophical work==
Jacobi&#x27;s philosophy is essentially unsystematic. A fundamental view which underlies all his thinking is brought to bear in succession upon those systematic doctrines which appear to stand most sharply in contradiction to it, and any positive philosophic results are given only occasionally. The leading idea of the whole is that of the complete separation between understanding [comprehension] and apprehension of real fact. For Jacobi, Understanding, or the logical faculty, is purely formal or elaborative, and its results never transcend the given material supplied to it. From the basis of immediate experience or perception thought proceeds by comparison and abstraction, establishing connections among facts, but remaining in its nature mediate and finite.

The principle of reason and consequent, the necessity of thinking each given fact of perception as conditioned, impels understanding towards an endless series of identical propositions, the records of successive comparisons and abstractions. The province of the understanding is therefore strictly the region of the conditioned; to it the world must present itself as a mechanism. If, then, there is objective truth at all, the existence of real facts must be made known to us otherwise than through the logical faculty of thought; and, as the regress from conclusion to premises must depend upon something not itself capable of logical grounding, mediate thought implies the consciousness of immediate truth.

It is impossible that there should be a God, for if so he would of necessity be finite. But a finite God, a God that is known, is no God. It is impossible that there should be liberty, for if so the mechanical order of phenomena, by means of which they are comprehensible, would be disturbed, and we should have an unintelligible world, coupled with the requirement that it shall be understood. Cognition, then, in the strict sense, occupies the middle place between sense perception, which is belief in matters of sense, and reason, which is belief in supersensuous fact.

*The passage presents a one-sided portrayal of Jacobi, emphasizing his advocacy for Glaube (faith or belief) and revelation over speculative reason while aligning him with contemporary critics of secular philosophy. However, this interpretation is reductive and lacks nuance. Jacobi&#x27;s philosophical contributions cannot be reduced to a binary opposition between faith and reason; his work also engaged deeply with Enlightenment thought, challenging its premises without wholly rejecting its intellectual rigor.

*For instance, while Jacobi critiqued pure rationalism, he did not dismiss reason outright but rather sought to balance it with other dimensions of human experience. This nuanced position is often overlooked, leading to an oversimplified narrative that portrays him as solely a precursor to modern critiques of secularism. Moreover, the passage&#x27;s selective emphasis on his relationships—such as his brief friendship with Goethe or his familial connections—overshadows the complexity of his philosophical legacy.

*A more balanced account would acknowledge not only Jacobi&#x27;s critique of Enlightenment rationalism but also his contributions to existential questions and his influence on thinkers like Kierkegaard. By omitting these facets, the text risks portraying Jacobi as an emblem of anti-secularism rather than as a multifaceted thinker grappling with the tensions between reason, faith, and revelation.

== Reception ==
According to Stefan Schick, Jacobi was always &quot;defamed as an apologist of religious faith and an enemy of reason&quot; in both the 19th and 20th century. It was not until 1990s and 2000s, that the work of scholars such as Dieter Henrich, and specially Birgit Sandkaulen in her book &quot;Grund und Ursache&quot; (2000) revitalized the systematic reading of Jacobi for the first time. Moreover influential works such as Frederick Beiser&#x27;s &quot;Fate of Reason&quot; (1987) still portray Jacobi as an anti-enlightenment, religious thinker.

<text>Allodontidae (from ancient Greek &quot;ἄλλος&quot; &quot;ὀδούς&quot;, &quot;different tooth&quot;) is a family of extinct multituberculate mammal that lived in what is now North America during the Upper Jurassic period. They were relatively early mammals and are within the informal suborder of &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot;. The family was named by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1889. Two genera are recognized: &quot;Ctenacodon&quot; and &quot;Psalodon&quot;.

After studying philology and especially ancient classics and Sanskrit at Bonn and Berlin (1830–1835), he took the degree of doctor of philosophy and established himself in 1837 at Bonn as &quot;privatdozent&quot; for classical philology. He had already, in his &quot;Goethes Faust in seiner Einheit und Ganzheit&quot; (1836) and &quot;Goethe als Dramatiker&quot; (1837), advocated a new critical method in interpreting the German classics, which he wished to see treated like the ancient classics.

He subsequently turned his attention almost exclusively to the poets of the German classical period, notably Goethe and Schiller. Düntzer&#x27;s method met with much opposition and he consequently failed to obtain the professorship he coveted. From 1846 up to the time of his death in 1901 he maintained the post of librarian at the Roman Catholic gymnasium in Cologne. In 1849 he was awarded with the title of professor.

==Evaluation==
Düntzer was a painstaking and accurate critic, but lacking in inspiration and finer literary taste, consequently his work as a biographer and commentator has, to a great extent, been superseded and discredited.

==Works==
Among his philological writings may be mentioned:
*&quot;Die Lehre von der lateinischen Wortbildung&quot; (1836).
*&quot;Die Deklination der indogermanischen Sprachen&quot; (1839).
*&quot;Homer und der epische Kyklos&quot; (1839).
*&quot;Die homerischen Beiwörter des Götter- und Menschengeschlechts&quot; (1859).

Of his works on the German classical poets, especially Goethe, Schiller and Herder, the following are particularly worthy of note:
*&quot;Erläuterungen zu den deutschen Klassikern&quot; (1853–1892).
*&quot;Goethes Prometheus und Pandora&quot; (1850).
*&quot;Goethes Faust&quot; (2 vols., 1850–1851; 2nd edition 1857).
*&quot;Goethes Götz und Egmont&quot; (1854).
*&quot;Aus Goethes Freundeskreise&quot; (1868).
*&quot;Abhandlungen zu Goethes Leben und Werken&quot; (2 vols, 1885).
*&quot;Goethes Tagebücher der sechs ersten weimarischen Jahre&quot; (1889).
*&quot;Goethes Leben&quot; (1880; 2nd edition 1883; Engl. transl. by T Lyster, London, 1884): &quot;Life of Goethe&quot;, Vol.1, &quot;Life of Goethe&quot;, Vol.2.
*&quot;Schillers Leben&quot; (1881); translated into English and published as: The Life of Schiller (1883).
*&quot;Schiller und Goethe&quot; (1859).
*&quot;Übersicht und Erläuterung zum Briefwechsel zwischen Schiller und Goethe&quot; (1859).

<text>3C 273 is a quasar located at the center of a giant elliptical galaxy in the constellation of Virgo. It was the first quasar ever to be identified and is the visually brightest quasar in the sky as seen from Earth, with an apparent visual magnitude of 12.9. The derived distance to this object is . The mass of its central supermassive black hole is approximately 886 million times the mass of the Sun.

== Observation ==
3C 273 is visible from March to July in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Situated in the Virgo constellation, it is bright enough to be observed by eye with a amateur telescope. Due in part to its radio luminosity and its discovery as the first identified quasar, 3C 273&#x27;s right ascension in the Fifth Fundamental Catalog (FK5) is used to standardize the positions of 23 extragalactic radio sources used to define the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS).

Given its distance from Earth and visual magnitude, 3C 273 is the most distant celestial object average amateur astronomers are likely to see through their telescopes.

==Properties==

This is the optically brightest quasar in the sky from Earth with an apparent visual magnitude of ~12.9, and one of the closest with a redshift, &quot;z&quot;, of 0.158. A luminosity distance of DL = may be calculated from &quot;z&quot;. Using parallax methods with the Very Large Telescope interferometer yields a distance estimate of  ().

It is one of the most luminous quasars known, with an absolute magnitude of −26.7, meaning that if it were only as distant as Pollux (~10 parsecs) it would appear nearly as bright in the sky as the Sun. Since the Sun&#x27;s absolute magnitude is 4.83, it means that the quasar is over 4 trillion times more luminous than the Sun at visible wavelengths.

The luminosity of 3C 273 is variable at nearly every wavelength from radio waves to gamma rays on timescales of a few days to decades. Polarization with coincident orientation has been observed with radio, infrared, and optical light being emitted from a large-scale jet; these emissions are therefore almost certainly synchrotron in nature. The radiation is created by a jet of charged particles moving at relativistic speeds. VLBI radio observations of 3C 273 have revealed proper motion of some of the radio emitting regions, further suggesting the presence of relativistic jets of material.

This is a prototype of an Active Galactic Nucleus, demonstrating that the energy is being produced through accretion by a supermassive black hole (SMBH). No other astrophysical source can produce the observed energy. The mass of its central SMBH has been measured to be million solar masses through broad emission-line reverberation mapping.

===Large-scale jet===
The quasar has a large-scale visible jet, which measures ~ long, having an apparent size of 23″. Such jets are believed to be created by the interaction of the central black hole and the accretion disk. In 1995, optical imaging of the jet using the Hubble Space Telescope revealed a structured morphology evidenced by repeated bright knots interlaced by areas of weak emission. The viewing angle of the jet is about 6° as seen from Earth. The jet was observed to abruptly change direction by an intrinsic angle of 2° in 2003, which is larger than the jet&#x27;s intrinsic opening angle of 1.1°. An expanding cocoon of heated gas is being generated by the jet, which may be impacting an inclined disk of gas within the central .

===Host galaxy===
3C 273 lies at the center of a giant elliptical galaxy with an apparent magnitude of 16 and an apparent size of 29 arcseconds. The morphological classification of the host galaxy is E4, indicating a moderately flattened elliptical shape. The galaxy has an estimated mass of .

==History==
The name signifies that it was the 273rd object (ordered by right ascension) of the Third Cambridge Catalog of Radio Sources (3C), published in 1959. After accurate positions were obtained using lunar occultation by Cyril Hazard at the Parkes Radio Telescope, the radio source was quickly associated with an optical counterpart, an unresolved &quot;stellar object&quot;. In 1963, Maarten Schmidt and Bev Oke published a pair of papers in &quot;Nature&quot; reporting that 3C 273 has a substantial redshift of 0.158, placing it several billion light-years away.

Prior to the discovery of 3C 273, several other radio sources had been associated with optical counterparts, the first being 3C 48. Also, many active galaxies had been misidentified as variable stars, including the famous BL Lac, W Com and AU CVn. However, it was not understood what these objects were, since their spectra were unlike those of any known stars. Its spectrum did not resemble that of any normal stars with typical stellar elements. 3C 273 was the first object to be identified as a quasar—an extremely luminous object at an astronomical distance.

3C 273 is a radio-loud quasar, and was also one of the first extragalactic X-ray sources discovered in 1970.
However, even to this day, the process which gives rise to the X-ray emissions is controversial.

<text>The magpie-lark (Grallina cyanoleuca), also known as wee magpie, peewee, peewit, mudlark or Murray magpie, is a passerine bird native to Australia, Timor and southern New Guinea. The male and female both have black and white plumage, though with different patterns. John Latham described the species in 1801. Long thought to be a member of the mudnest builder family Corcoracidae, it has been reclassified in the family Monarchidae (the monarch flycatchers). Two subspecies are recognized.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The magpie-lark was originally described by the English ornithologist John Latham in the genus &quot;Corvus&quot; in 1801 (as &quot;Corvus cyanoleucus&quot;). Its species name is derived from the Ancient Greek words &quot;cyanos&quot; &quot;dark blue&quot; and &quot;leukos&quot; &quot;white&quot; despite the black and white plumage. However, there can be a bluish sheen to the black back. In the same publication, Latham described the same species as &quot;Gracula picata&quot;. In 1843, Hugh Edwin Strickland proposed using the second name as it was the more accurate, resulting in &quot;Grallina picata&quot;. Formerly, some authorities have classified the magpie-lark as belonging to a genus of bee-eaters, &quot;Merops&quot;.

Latham gave the species the common names of blue and white crow and pied grackle, based on the scientific names. John Gould likewise called it the pied grallina in 1848, though he noted that it was called magpie-lark by the early settlers. Gould noted similarities to the British pied wag-tail, and its flight to that of the European common pewit. Alternate names for the magpie-lark include the mudlark (more common in southeastern Australia) or pugwall (pug &quot;clay&quot;), from its nest, and peewee (more common in northeastern Australia), peewit, from its call. Unlike many species in southwestern Australia, the magpie-lark was given names by the local indigenous people that were onomatopoeic (sounding like the calls they make). Names recorded include &quot;byoolkolyedi&quot; (Perth and lowlands), &quot;dilabot&quot; (mountains and interior), and &quot;koolyibarak&quot;. Indigenous people in the Sydney region called it &quot;birrarik&quot;.

Additional common names used regionally include Murray magpie in South Australia.
In 1977, the RAOU settled on Australian magpie-lark as the official name, noting that the names magpie lark and, less commonly, mudlark were used in guidebooks at the time.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;G. c. cyanoleuca&quot; – : Found in western, central, eastern and southern Australia
* &quot;G. c. neglecta&quot; – : Found in northern Australia

Long thought to be a member of the mudnest builder family Corcoracidae, the magpie-lark and the closely related torrent lark (&quot;Grallina brujini&quot;) have been reclassified in the family Monarchidae (the monarch flycatchers). The two make up a lineage that split off early from other monarchs and has no close relatives within the family.

==Description==

The magpie-lark is a small to medium size bird, reaching long when fully grown, or about the same size as a European common blackbird, and boldly pied in black and white; the weight range is for males, and for females. The sexes are similar from a distance but easy to tell apart: the female has a white throat, the male a black throat and a white &quot;eyebrow&quot;. Juveniles and immatures of either sex have the white throat of the female and the black eyestripe of the male, and a white belly.

==Distribution and habitat==
The magpie-lark is a common and very widespread bird both in urban and rural areas, occupying all parts of Australia except for Tasmania and some of the inland desert in the far north-west of Western Australia, and appears to have adapted well to the presence of humans. It is also found in southern New Guinea and on the island of Timor. In 1924 it was introduced onto Lord Howe Island which lies to the east of Australia in the Tasman Sea. It is now widespread on the island. The magpie-lark is a familiar sight around Australia; sitting on telephone wires either alone or in pairs, or patrolling patches of bare ground, especially foreshores or swamps. It has been recorded as a vagrant to New Zealand once.

==Behaviour and ecology==

A primarily carnivorous species that eats all sorts of small creatures, the magpie-lark can adapt to an enormous range of different habitats, requiring only some soft, bare ground for foraging, a supply of mud for making a nest, and a tree to make it in. It has benefited greatly from agriculture: both the clearing of dense forest in fertile zones and the provision of artesian water in arid areas—although a disaster for other species—have been a boon for bare-ground and short-grass feeders like magpies and magpie-larks.

Group gatherings of magpie-larks have been observed, with loose &quot;flocks&quot; comprising dozens of individuals being observed perched on vantage points. They sit near houses and on fences to mark their territory and look for mates. This behaviour can be frustrating to residents in suburban areas because of their excessive high pitch shrieks. Such behaviour is common, particularly in rural and suburban environments. This behaviour may be pairing or breeding related or simply indicate a bountiful feeding area. 
The magpie-lark is aggressively territorial, and will fearlessly defend its territory against larger species such as magpies, ravens, kookaburras, and even the wedge-tailed eagle.
They are also known to attack people to defend their nesting area. 
Although their attacks on people are not as aggressive as those of masked lapwings and magpies, they can still result in surprise or minor injury to the recipient.

They are also known to attack mirrors, windows and other reflective surfaces in which they mistake their reflection for an intruder into their territory.

===Breeding===

Birds generally pair for life (though divorce is not unknown) and defend a territory together. The nest is round, about 150 mm in diameter with vertical sides and is usually placed on a flat branch somewhere near water or on a horizontal beam of a telephone pole. It is made of grass and plant material thickly plastered together with mud, and generously lined with grass, feathers and fur. Breeding is opportunistic, usually from August to February in the fertile south, anytime after rain in drier areas, and multiple broods are common when conditions allow. Both parents incubate a clutch of between three and five eggs. Incubation of eggs takes up to eighteen days, and the young birds fledge about three weeks after hatching. It is quite common for only some of the chicks to survive because sometimes the nest is not big enough for all of the baby birds, therefore one baby will sometimes push another out of the nest and it is most likely that the chick will not survive the fall.

With climate change, Australia is seeing warmer summer temperatures and milder winters. Magpie-larks are breeding for longer cycles during the year as a result.

===Duet singing===

Magpie-larks are one of the 200-odd species of bird around the world that are known to sing in duet; each partner producing about one note a second, but a half-second apart, so that humans find it difficult to tell that there are actually two birds singing, not one.

Traditionally, it has been thought that the function of duet singing (not just in magpie-larks but birds more generally and indeed in mammals, insects and frogs) was to defend a territory or to maintain the pair-bond. More recently it has been proposed that it serves to guard against infidelity—that the male sings to attract a mate, and the female joins in to let her rivals know that this particular male is already taken.

Duet singing remains fairly poorly understood as a great deal of the existing research on birdsong has been carried out in the northern Hemisphere, where a fairly small number of female birds sing.

In the case of the magpie-lark, the duet singing is now known to be cooperative: pairs sing together to defend their territory. Magpie-larks sing more vigorously in response to duet calls from other birds than they do to the call of a single rival, and more vigorously still if the callers are strangers rather than established and familiar birds from a neighbouring territory. A pair of neighbours calling from the &quot;wrong&quot; place, however, (as when calls are recorded and played back by an experimenter) bring forth a powerful reaction: clearly, they know exactly who their neighbours are. Magpie-larks also engage in pseudo-duets when nesting. In this, one individual mimicks the contribution of a missing partner, sustaining the impression to other birds that two are present.

<text>Christoph Martin Wieland (; ; 5 September 1733 – 20 January 1813) was a German poet and writer, representative of literary Rococo. He is best-remembered for having written the first &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; (&quot;Geschichte des Agathon&quot;), as well as the epic &quot;Oberon&quot;, which formed the basis for both Friederike Sophie Seyler&#x27;s opera of the same name and Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s opera of the same name. His thought was representative of the cosmopolitanism of the German Enlightenment, exemplified in his remark: &quot;Only a true cosmopolitan can be a good citizen.&quot; He was a key figure of Weimar Classicism and a collaborator of Abel Seyler&#x27;s theatre company.

==Biography==
Christoph Martin Wieland was born in Oberholzheim (now part of Achstetten), half of which then belonged to the Free Imperial City of Biberach an der Riss and the other half to Gutenzell Abbey in the south-east of the modern-day state of Baden-Württemberg.

His father, who was pastor in Oberholzheim and subsequently in Biberach, took great pains with his son&#x27;s education. From the town school of Biberach he passed on at the age of twelve to the Kloster Berge &quot;gymnasium&quot;, near Magdeburg. He was a precocious child, and when he left school in 1749 was widely read in the Latin classics and the leading contemporary French writers; amongst German poets his favourites were Brockes and Klopstock.

During the summer of 1750, he fell in love with a cousin, Sophie Gutermann, and this love affair inspired him to plan his first ambitious work, &quot;Die Natur der Dinge&quot; (The Nature of Things, 1752), a didactic poem in six books. In 1750 he went to the University of Tübingen as a student of law, but his time was mainly taken up with literary studies. The poems he wrote at the university—&quot;Hermann&quot;, an epic (published by F. Muncker, 1886), &quot;Zwölf moralische Briefe in Versen&quot; (Twelve Moral Letters in Verse, 1752), &quot;Anti-Ovid&quot; (1752)—are pietistic in tone and dominated by the influence of Klopstock.
Wieland&#x27;s poetry attracted the attention of the Swiss literary reformer, J. J. Bodmer, who invited Wieland to visit him in Zürich in the summer of 1752. After a few months however, he felt little sympathy with Wieland as, two years earlier, he had felt himself with Klopstock, and the friends parted; but Wieland remained in Switzerland until 1760, spending the last year, at Bern where he obtained a position as private tutor. Here he became intimate with Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s friend Julie de Bondeli.
Wieland&#x27;s tastes had changed; the writings of his early Swiss years—&quot;Der geprüfte Abraham&quot; (The Trial of Abraham&#x27;s Faith, 1753), &quot;Sympathien&quot; (1756), &quot;Empfindungen eines Christen&quot; (1757)—were still in the manner of his earlier writings, but with the tragedies, &quot;Lady Johanna Gray&quot; (1758), and &quot;Clementina von Porretta&quot; (1760)—the latter based on Samuel Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Sir Charles Grandison&quot;—the epic fragment &quot;Cyrus&quot; (first five cantos, 1759), and the &quot;moral story in dialogues&quot;, &quot;Araspes und Panthea&quot; (1760), Wieland, as Gotthold Lessing said, &quot;forsook the ethereal spheres to wander again among the sons of men.&quot; In &quot;Cyrus&quot;, he had been inspired by the deeds of Frederick the Great to write a poem exhibiting the ideal of a hero. &quot;Araspes und Panthea&quot; is based on an episode from the &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; of Xenophon.

Wieland&#x27;s conversion was completed at Biberach, having returned in 1760 as director of the chancery. The monotony of his life here was relieved by the friendship of a Count Stadion, whose library in the castle of Warthausen, not far from Biberach, was well stocked with French and English literature. Wieland met again his early love Sophie Gutermann, who had become the wife of Hofrat La Roche, then manager of Count Stadion&#x27;s estates.

In &quot;Don Sylvio von Rosalva&quot; (1764), a romance in imitation of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, he held his earlier faith up to ridicule and in the &quot;Comische Erzählungen&quot; (1765) he gave his extravagant imagination only too free a rein.
More important is the novel &quot;Geschichte des Agathon&quot; (1766–1767), in which, under the guise of a Greek fiction, Wieland described his own spiritual and intellectual growth. This work, which Lessing recommended as &quot;a novel of classic taste&quot;, marks an epoch in the development of the modern psychological novel. Of equal importance was Wieland&#x27;s translation of twenty-two of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays into prose (8 vols., 1762–1766); it was the first attempt to present the English poet to the German people in something approaching entirety. With the poems &quot;Musarion oder die Philosophie der Grazien&quot; (1768), &quot;Idris&quot; (1768), &quot;Combabus&quot; (1770), &quot;Der neue Amadis&quot; (1771), Wieland opened the series of light and graceful romances in verse which appealed so irresistibly to his contemporaries and acted as an antidote to the sentimental excesses of the subsequent Sturm und Drang movement. &quot;Musarion&quot; advocates a rational unity of the sensual and spiritual; &quot;Amadis&quot; celebrates the triumph of intellectual over physical beauty.
Wieland married Anna Dorothea von Hillenbrand (July 8, 1746 – November 9, 1801) on October 21, 1765. They had 14 children. Wieland&#x27;s daughter Sophia Catharina Susanna Wieland (October 19, 1768 – September 1, 1837) married philosopher Karl Leonhard Reinhold (1757–1823) on May 18, 1785.

Between 1769 and 1772, Wieland was a professor of philosophy at the University of Erfurt. In his &quot;Verklagter Amor&quot; (&quot;Cupid Accused&quot;) he defended amatory poetry; and in the &quot;Dialogen des Diogenes von Sinope&quot; (1770) he gave a general vindication of his philosophical views.

In 1772 he published &quot;Der goldene Spiegel oder die Könige van Scheschian&quot;, a pedagogic work in the form of oriental stories; this attracted the attention of Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, and resulted in his appointment as tutor to her two sons, the Duke Karl August and his brother Prince Constantin, at Weimar. With the exception of some years spent at Ossmannstedt, where in later life he bought an estate, Weimar remained Wieland&#x27;s home until his death. Turning his attention to dramatic poetry, he wrote opera librettos such as &quot;Wahl des Hercules&quot; (&quot;Choice of Hercules&quot;) and &quot;Alceste&quot; by Anton Schweitzer.

In 1773, he founded &quot;Der teutsche Merkur&quot;, which under his editorship (1773–1789) became the most influential literary review in Germany. His views, as exhibited therein, however, showed so much of the narrow conventional spirit of French criticism, that he was attacked by Goethe in the satire &quot;Götter, Helden und Wieland&quot; (&quot;Gods, Heroes and Wieland&quot;). This Wieland answered with great good nature, recommending it to all who were fond of wit and sarcasm. Goethe and Johann Gottfried Herder were soon drawn to Weimar, where the Duchess Anna Amalia formed a circle of talent and genius, later also joined by Friedrich Schiller.

Politically, Wieland was a moderate liberal who advocated a constitutional monarchy, a free press, and a middle path between extremes of left and right. At least three of his works, &quot;Geschichte des Agathon&quot;, &quot;Der goldene Spiegel oder die Könige van Scheschian&quot;, and &quot;Beiträge zur geheimen Geschichte des menschlichen Verstandes und Herzens&quot;, found themselves on the official Bavarian Illuminati reading list.

He was also a librettist for the Seyler theatrical company of Abel Seyler. Of his later writings the most important are the admirable satire on German provinciality — the most attractive of all his prose writings — &quot;Die Abderiten, eine sehr wahrscheinliche Geschichte&quot; (A very probable history of the Abderites, 1774), (translated into French by Antoine Gilbert Griffet de Labaume) and the charming poetic romances, &quot;Das Wintermärchen&quot; (1776), &quot;Das Sommermärchen&quot; (1777), &quot;Geron der Adelige&quot; (1777), &quot;Pervonte oder die Wünsche&quot; (1778), a series culminating with Wieland&#x27;s poetic masterpiece, the romantic epic of &quot;Oberon&quot; (1780). In 1780 he created the singspiel &quot;Rosamunde&quot; with the composer Anton Schweitzer.

In Wieland&#x27;s later novels, such as the &quot;Geheime Geschichte des Philosophen Peregrinus Proteus&quot; (1791) and &quot;Aristipp und einige seiner Zeitgenossen&quot; (1800–1802), a didactic and philosophic tendency obscures the small literary interest they possess. He also translated Horace&#x27;s &quot;Satires&quot; (1786), Lucian&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot; (1788–1789), Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Letters&quot; (1808 ff.), and from 1796 to 1803 he edited the &quot;Attisches Museum&quot; which did valuable service in popularizing Greek studies. Wieland was also strongly influenced by the French fairy-tale vogue of the 18th century, he published a collection of tales entitled &quot;Dschinnistan&quot; (1786–1789), which included three original tales, &#x27;Der Stein der Weisen&#x27; (&#x27;The Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&#x27;), &#x27;Timander und Melissa&#x27;, and &#x27;Der Druide oder die Salamanderin und die Bildsäule&#x27; (&#x27;The Druid or the Salamander and the Painted Pillar&#x27;). Wieland had a strong influence on the German literature of his time.

He died in Weimar.

<text>Johann Gottfried Gruber (29 November 1774 – 7 August 1851) was a German critic and literary historian.

==Biography==
Gruber was born at Naumburg on the Saale, in the Electorate of Saxony.

He received his education at the town school of Naumburg and the University of Leipzig, after which he resided successively at Göttingen, Leipzig, Jena and Weimar, occupying himself partly in teaching and partly in various literary enterprises, and enjoying in Weimar the friendship of Herder, Wieland and Goethe.

In 1811 he was appointed professor at the University of Wittenberg, and after the division of Saxony he was sent by the senate to Berlin to negotiate the union of the University of Wittenberg with that of Halle. After the union was effected he became in 1815 professor of philosophy at Halle. He was associated with Johann Samuel Ersch in the editorship of the great work &quot;Allgemeine Encyclopädie der Wissenschaften und Künste&quot;; and after the death of Ersch he continued the first section from vol. xviii. to vol. liv. He also succeeded Ersch in the editorship of the &quot;Allgemeine Literaturzeitung&quot;.

Gruber was the author of a large number of works, the principal of which are &quot;Charakteristik Herders&quot; (Leipzig, 1805), in conjunction with Johann T. L. Danz (1769–1851), afterwards professor of theology at Jena; &quot;Geschichte des menschlichen Geschlechts&quot; (2 volumes, Leipzig, 1806); &quot;Wörterbuch der altklassischen Mythologie&quot; (3 volumes, Weimar, 1810–1815); a life of Christoph Martin Wieland (&quot;Wielands Leben&quot;, 2 parts, Weimar, 1815–1816), and of Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock (&quot;Klopstocks Leben&quot;, Weimar, 1832). He also edited Wieland&#x27;s collected works (&quot;Wielands sämmtliche Werke&quot;, Leipzig, 1818–1828).

<doc id="204042" wikidata="Q5457185" url="?curid=204042" title="Flameless ration heater">
<text>A flameless ration heater (FRH), colloquially an MRE heater, is a form of self-heating food packaging included in U.S. military Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE) rations since 1993.

The heater is a plastic bag filled with magnesium and iron powders and table salt. When a meal pouch is placed in the bag and water is added, an exothermic reaction occurs which rapidly boils the water to heat the food.

The U.S. Army began research into a chemical method to heating meals in 1973. The FRH was first issued in May 1990, and an FRH was included with each MRE since 1993.

== History ==
Before the development of the FRH, service members heated their meals by boiling the food pouches in a canteen cup heated over a lit Sterno gel or portable stove. This was slow, especially in cold weather, and was made more difficult in windy or wet conditions. It also produced a visible flame that was undesirable at night. Sometimes they heated the pouches by placing them on a hot vehicle&#x27;s engine block or exhaust manifold. Because of these problems, service members frequently ate their meals cold either due to a lack of a heating source, a lack of time, or both.

The research and development into a flameless ration heater began in 1973 by the U.S. Army Natick Research, Development, and Engineering Center in Natick, Massachusetts. A patented water-activated magnesium-carbon chemical heating product was investigated. In 1980, Natick learned that the U.S. Navy had developed a magnesium-iron alloy powder for buoyancy devices and heated diving vests. This was more cost efficient, so the University of Cincinnati was contracted to develop it into a prototype MRE heater, which was called the Dismounted Ration Heating Device (DRHD). The inventors later incorporated under the name Zesto-Therm Inc. and patented the meal heating product (now called the ZT Energy Pad), and began selling it for civilian use.

In 1986 the U.S. Army evaluated the ZT Energy Pad and found that it did not always heat the food adequately and left a messy residue on the outside of the food pouches. A focus group of 26 soldiers was surveyed to compare heating an MRE with a Zesto-Therm pad compared to the canteen cup method heated with a trioxane fuel bar. 100% preferred the flameless ration heater: it was compact, disposable, and didn&#x27;t require equipment to carry and clean. However, it was about twice as expensive as a trioxane fuel bar. Although, it was discovered that in cold climates, two or even three trioxane bars would be needed to adequately heat the meal, making the FRH cheaper overall.

Other prototypes were developed, such as the Mounted Ration Heating Device (MRHD), an electrical device that could be powered from a vehicle&#x27;s power supply and used to heat up to four rations at once. The MRHD was generally preferred over the Zesto-Therm pads, but not all vehicles had the proper connections to power the device, and having a single device meant service members needed to take turns using it.

A package needed to be developed to safely cook the food in while the chemical reaction was activated. Zesto-Therm already had a line of insulated cooking pouches on the market, but they were found to be too expensive and impractical to be issued with each MRE. A high-density polyethylene bag was developed that was food safe, would protect the chemical from accidental activation when stored, could withstand the temperatures required during cooking, and was transparent so the service member could easily measure a quantity of water by filling it to a line printed on the bag.

Once the design was finalized, the acquisition process was quickly completed. In May 1990, the FRH was approved for bulk issue. A process that normally takes four to six years to award contracts was instead completed in one year so the FRH could be used in Operation Desert Storm. 51 million FRHs were purchased for $25 million, and approximately 4.5 million FRHs were shipped to Southwest Asia for the Gulf War. Beginning in 1993, one FRH was packaged with each MRE.

== Usage ==

The flameless ration heater is issued in a plastic bag with instructions printed on it. Inside the bag is a small quantity of metallic powders, which does the actual heating. To heat a meal, the bag is first torn open, and a sealed food pouch is placed inside. About of water is then added to the bag, using the line printed on the bag as a marker. The chemical reaction begins immediately, and takes about 12 to 15 minutes to heat a food pouch to about . It is recommended to place the bag within the cardboard carton the MRE is issued with to prevent injury, and to prop it upright so the water does not leak out and prematurely stop the reaction.

== Chemical reaction ==
Ration heaters generate heat in an electron-transfer process called an oxidation-reduction reaction. Water oxidizes magnesium metal, according to the following chemical reaction:

: Mg + 2H2O → Mg(OH)2 + H2 [+ heat (q)]

This reaction is analogous to iron being rusted by oxygen, and proceeds at about the same slow rate, which is too slow to generate usable heat. To accelerate the reaction, metallic iron particles and table salt (NaCl) are mixed with the magnesium particles.

Iron and magnesium metals, when suspended in an electrolyte, form a galvanic cell that can generate electricity. When water is added to a ration heater, it dissolves the salt to form a salt-water electrolyte, thereby turning each particle of magnesium and iron into a tiny battery. Because the magnesium and iron particles are in contact, they essentially become thousands of tiny short-circuited batteries which quickly burn out, producing heat in a process the patent holders call &quot;supercorroding galvanic cells&quot;.

One brand of self-heating rations uses 7.5 grams of a powdered magnesium-iron alloy, consisting of 95% magnesium and 5% iron by weight, 0.5 grams of salt, in addition to an inert filler and anti-foaming agent. Upon adding of water, this mixture can raise the temperature of a meal packet by in about 10 minutes, releasing approximately of heat energy at about 80 watts.

The main disadvantage of the magnesium-based heaters is the production of hydrogen gas. While it is not often a risk when used in the field, it may pose a fire hazard for consumer use. Alternative formulations have been developed to eliminate the hydrogen gas, such as the combination of aluminum chloride with calcium oxide (AlCl3/CaO) and diphosphorous pentoxide with calcium oxide (P2O5/CaO).

== Confined space hazard ==

The United States Department of Transportation (DOT) Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducted testing and released a report which in summary states &quot;... the release of hydrogen gas from these flameless ration heaters is of a sufficient quantity to pose a potential hazard on board a passenger aircraft.&quot; This testing was performed on commercial grade &#x27;heater meals&#x27; which consisted of an unenclosed flameless heat pouch, a bag of salt water, a styrofoam saucer/tray and a meal in a sealed, microwavable/boilable bowl.

== Disposal ==

MRE heaters that have not been properly activated must be disposed of as hazardous waste. Disposing of an
un-activated MRE heater in a solid waste container is against United States law. Un-activated MRE heaters pose a
potential fire hazard if they become wet when turned in at a landfill site. MRE heaters must be disposed of in
approved solid waste containers aboard the installation after they have been properly activated. The FRH can be disposed of as household waste after it is activated and cools down.

<text>The C-ration (officially Field Ration, Type C) was a United States military ration consisting of prepared, canned wet foods. They were intended to be served when fresh or packaged unprepared food was unavailable, and survival rations were insufficient. It was replaced by the similarly canned Meal, Combat, Individual (MCI) in 1958; its modern successor is the retort pouch-based Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE), introduced in 1980.

Development of the C-ration began in 1938. The first rations were field-tested in 1940, and wide-scale adoption followed soon after. Operational conditions often caused the C-ration to be standardized for field issue regardless of environmental suitability or weight limitations. Though the C-ration was replaced in 1958, the new MCI was very similar to the C-ration, and was indeed still nicknamed the &quot;C-ration&quot; until its replacement by the MRE in the late 1970s.

The C-ration differs from other American alphabetized rations such as the A-ration, consisting of fresh food; B-ration, consisting of packaged, unprepared food; D-ration, consisting of military chocolate; K-ration, consisting of three balanced meals; and emergency rations, intended for emergencies when other food or rations are unavailable.

==Background and development==
===Iron Ration (1907–1922)===
The first American attempt to make an individual ration for issue to soldiers in the field was the Iron Ration, introduced in 1907. It contained three 3-ounce cakes (made from a concoction of beef bouillon powder and parched, cooked wheat), three 1-ounce bars of sweetened chocolate, and packets of salt and pepper. The ration was issued in a sealed tin packet that weighed one pound, to be carried in an infantryman&#x27;s top tunic pocket, and was designed for emergency use when the troops were unable to be supplied with food. It was later discontinued by the adoption of the &quot;Reserve Ration&quot;, but findings from the development and use of the Iron Ration went into the development of the emergency D-ration.

===Reserve Ration (1917–1937)===
The Reserve Ration was issued during the later part of World War I to feed troops who were away from a garrison or field kitchen. It originally consisted of of bacon or of meat (usually canned corned beef), two cans of hard bread or hardtack biscuits, a packet of of pre-ground coffee, a packet of of granulated sugar, and a packet of of salt. There was also a separate &quot;tobacco ration&quot; of of tobacco and 10 cigarette rolling papers, later replaced by brand-name machine-rolled cigarettes.

After the war, there were attempts to improve the ration based on input from the field. In 1922, the ration was reorganized to consist of of meat (usually beef jerky), of canned corned beef or chocolate, of hard bread or hardtack biscuits, coffee and sugar. In 1925, the meat ration was replaced with canned pork and beans. In 1936, there was an attempt at variety by having an &quot;A&quot;-menu of corned beef and a &quot;B&quot;-menu of pork and beans. This was cancelled upon introduction of the new C-ration in 1938.

==Field ration, Type C (1938–1945)==
The original Type C ration, commonly known as the C-ration, was intended to replace the Reserve Ration as a short-term individual ration designed for short use, to be supplemented by the D-ration emergency ration.

Development of a replacement for the Reserve Ration was undertaken by the newly formed Quartermaster Subsistence Research and Development Laboratory in Chicago in 1938 with the aim of producing a ration that was more palatable, nutritionally balanced, and had better keeping qualities.

The first C-ration consisted of a &#x27;meat&#x27; unit (M-unit) (reduced to after being field tested during the 1940 Louisiana maneuvers). In the initial C-ration, there were only three variations of the main course: meat and beans, meat and potato hash, or meat and vegetable stew. Also issued was one bread-and-dessert can, or B-unit. Each daily ration (i.e. enough food for one soldier for one day) consisted of six cans (three M-units and three B-units), while an individual meal consisted of one M-unit and one B-unit. The original oblong can was replaced with the more common cylindrical design in June 1939 due to mass production problems with the former shape of can.

The C-ration can was about tall and in diameter. It was made of non-corrugated tinplate, had a visible tin solder seam, and incorporated an opening strip. A key for use on the opening strip was soldered to the base of every B unit can.

The first C-ration cans had an aluminized finish, but in late 1940, this was changed to a gold lacquer finish to improve corrosion resistance. There was noticeable variation in the depth of gold color in World War II vintage cans, because of the large number of suppliers involved. Late in the war this was changed to drab green paint, which remained standard through the remainder of the C-ration&#x27;s service life, as well as that of the MCI.

During the war, soldiers frequently requested that the cylindrical cans be replaced with flat, rectangular ones (similar to a sardine can), comparable to those used in the earliest versions of contemporary K rations, because of their compactness and packability; but this was deemed impractical because of the shortage of commercial machinery available to produce rectangular cans. After 1942 the K ration too, reverted to the use of small round cans.

Initially, C-ration cans were marked only with paper labels, which soon fell off and made a guessing game out of evening meals; US Soldiers and Marines receiving an unpopular menu item several nights in a row often found themselves powerless to bargain for a more palatable one.

The C-ration was, in general, not well liked by U.S. Army or Marine forces in World War II, who found the cans heavy and cumbersome, and the menu monotonous after a short period of time. There were also inevitable problems with product consistency given the large number of suppliers involved and the pressures of wartime production. When issued to British or other Commonwealth forces formerly issued hardtack and bully beef-type rations, the C-ration was initially accepted, but monotony also became a chief complaint after a few days of consumption. Australian forces tended to dislike the C-ration, finding the canned food items generally bland, overly soft in texture, and unappealing. Originally intended only for infrequent use, the exigencies of combat sometimes forced supply authorities to make the C-ration the only source of sustenance for several weeks in succession. In 1943, a ration board reviewing medical examinations of soldiers after long-term use of C-rations recommended that they be restricted to a maximum of five continuous days in the absence of supplementation with other rations.

While the initial specification was officially declared obsolete in 1945, and production of all Type C rations ended in 1958, existing stockpiles of both original and revised Type C rations continued to be issued to troops serving in Korea and even as late as the Vietnam War. A Marine tank commander serving in Vietnam in 1968 noted his unit was frequently supplied with older stocks of C-rations, complete with early 1950s dates on the cans.

===&quot;M&quot; Unit===
The M-unit contained a canned entrée originally made of stew meat (a mixture of beef and pork) seasoned with salt, various spices, and chopped onions. They initially came in three varieties: Meat Stew with Beans, Meat with Vegetable Hash, and Meat Stew with Vegetables (carrots and potatoes). The commonplace nature of the menu was intentional, and designed to duplicate the menu items (e.g., hash, stews, etc.) soldiers were normally served as A- or B-rations in Army mess halls.

Another new menu item, &quot;Meat &amp; Spaghetti in Tomato Sauce&quot;, was added in 1943. In late 1944 &quot;Chopped Ham, Egg, and Potato&quot;, &quot;Meat and Noodles&quot;, &quot;Pork and Rice&quot;, &quot;Frankfurters and Beans&quot;, &quot;Pork and Beans&quot;, &quot;Ham and Lima Beans&quot;, and &quot;Chicken and Vegetables&quot; were introduced in an attempt to increase the C-rations&#x27; period of continuous use. The unpopular Meat Hash and equally unpopular experimental &quot;Mutton Stew with Vegetables&quot; meal were dropped. In the final revision, &quot;Beef Stew with Vegetables&quot; was added in 1945. By all accounts, after the meat hash and mutton stew, the Ham and Lima Beans entrée was the most unpopular; despite continued negative field reports, it inexplicably remained a standard entrée item not only during World War II, but also during the Korean War and Vietnam War.

===&quot;B&quot; Unit===
The B-unit (bread and dessert portion) contained several calorie-dense crackers, 3 sugar tablets, 3 dextrose energy tablets, and a packet or small can of beverage mix (instant coffee; powdered synthetic lemon drink, containing the rations&#x27; main source of vitamin C; or bouillon soup powder). Later revisions added orange drink powder (1944), sweetened cocoa powder (1944), and grape drink powder (1945), all enriched with vitamin C, to the list of beverages. In 1941, the energy tablets were replaced with loose candy, such as candy-coated peanuts or raisins, Charms hard candy, or Brachs chocolate or vanilla caramels. Due to spoilage, the loose candy was replaced in 1944 with a chocolate disk (e.g., Brachs fudge disk) or a cookie sandwich (e.g., Jim Dandee), and the number of biscuits was reduced to 4.

Another B-unit, consisting of pre-mixed oatmeal cereal, was introduced in 1944 as a breakfast ration that was usually paired with the &quot;Ham, Egg, and Potato&quot; Meal.

The inclusion of additional accessories and condiments led to the development of an accessory package.

The brown butcher paper accessory pack contained sugar tablets, halazone water purification tablets (for a brief period in 1945), a flat wooden spoon, a piece of candy-coated chewing gum, 3 &quot;short&quot; sample 3-packs or one &quot;long&quot; sample 9-pack of commercial-grade cigarettes and a book of 20 cardboard moisture-resistant matches, a paper-wrapped P-38 can opener printed with instructions for its proper use, and typically 22.5 sheets of toilet paper (compared to 3 sheets for the British Army). The P-38 can openers were generally worn on the GI&#x27;s &quot;dog tag&quot; chain to facilitate opening the next meal&#x27;s cans.

In 1945, the accessory pack was modified. Per the order of the Surgeon General, the halazone tablets were removed and salt tablets were added. Also, feedback from the field revealed that some soldiers opened up accessory packs just to get the cigarettes and threw away the rest of the items. To reduce waste, the accessory pack was now divided into the short pack with cigarettes and matches, and the long pack containing the other accessories.

Cigarette brands issued included Camel, Chelsea, Chesterfield, Craven A, Lucky Strike, Old Gold, Philip Morris, Player&#x27;s, Raleigh, and Wings.

===Crates===
The rations came packed in a small rectangular wooden crate that weighed 40 lbs. and had a volume of 1.12 cubic feet. Each crate contained 8 daily rations of 3 meals each for a total of 24 M-units, 24 B-units, and 24 accessory packs.

Early rations came with a variety of 8 &quot;Meat and Beans&quot;, 8 &quot;Meat &amp; Vegetable Hash&quot;, and 8 &quot;Meat &amp; Vegetable Stew&quot; M-units and 24 B-units. Later rations (c. 1944–1945) added a breakfast meal of 8 &quot;Chopped Ham, Egg, &amp; Potato&quot; M-units and 8 &quot;Compressed Cereal&quot; B-units in place of the &quot;Meat and Vegetable Hash&quot;. Alternate M-unit menu items came packed in cases of 24 M-units (and 24 B-units) rather than a mixed 8-8-8 menu like the main items.

==Field ration, Type E (1946–1948)==
After World War II there was an attempt to combine the best features of the C-ration and the K-ration into a new individual ration. Called the E-ration, it was for all intents and purposes the same canned C-ration, with the addition of some new components. In field testing, the bread component of the E-ration was found to be so unpalatable that the E-ration was quickly dropped from classification and inventory.

==Ration, Individual, Combat, Type C (Revised) (1948–1958)==
After the failure of the E-ration, ration planners decided to save costs by returning to the basic C-ration designation, intermittently revised with new menus and item specifications.

===Type C-2 ration (1948–1951)===
The C-2 ration was described in TB-QM-53, Department of the Army, dated March 1948, as an individual ration which consisted of packaged pre-cooked foods which could be eaten hot or cold. It replaced the World War II C-ration, and later, the short-lived E-ration. It could be carried and prepared by the individual soldier. The revised C-ration was now intended for feeding combat troops continuously, up to three weeks (21 days). Due to the required individual portability of this ration, maximum nourishment had to be provided in the smallest physical unit. The components of this ration were prepared in five different menus.

Each menu included an accessory packet which consisted of essential toilet articles, tobacco, and confections.

===Type C-3 ration (1951–1953)===
In 1951, a new C-3 menu for the C-ration was introduced. The C-3 ration was composed of the same five menus of the C-2, but offered greater variety. In addition to new and improved “B” (bread) and “M” (meat) units, each menu contained an accessory packet, fruit, and cigarettes. The ration was very heavy, weighing 5 lbs. 8.5 oz. [2.5 kg.], and was packed in 8 small cans in a cardboard box. There were 6 daily ration boxes per cardboard case.
*Three “M” (meat) components, which offered 10 different varieties of meat entrées.
**Chopped Eggs and Ham
**Pork and Beans
**Meat Chunks and Beans
*Three “B” (bread) components consisting of:
**B-1: a unit of 5 crackers, a packet of soluble coffee, a packet of powdered milk, a packet of granulated sugar, a cocoa disc, and a tin of jam.
**B-2: a unit of 5 crackers, a packet of soluble coffee, a packet of powdered milk, a packet of granulated sugar, 1 cookie sandwich, and 1 chocolate fudge disc.
**B-3: a unit of 5 crackers, a packet of soluble coffee, a packet of powdered milk, a packet of granulated sugar, 2 cookie sandwiches, and a tin of jam.
**B-4: a unit of pre-mixed and compressed cereal.
*One can of fruit.
*One sundries can containing the accessory packet (chewing gum, toilet paper, a P-38 can opener, granulated salt, and a flat wooden spoon) and the cigarette packet (one 9-pack of cigarettes and a book of matches).

Field cooking equipment was not required for the preparation of this ration. The C-3 ration was more adequate than the original C-ration in respect to its nutritional value.

===Type C-4 ration (1954–1958)===
In 1954, the C-4 ration was developed as a modification of the C-3 ration, and was called Ration, Combat, Individual. It included the issue of two cans of fruit for 2 meals to replace the one can issued for one meal in the C-3 ration.

A sample C-4 ration (stamped March 1954) contained:
*1 instruction sheet
*2 cheese bars (1.5 net ounces/43 g net)
*2 cereal class 5 bars (1.5 net ounces/43 g net)
*3 type XII style 1 enriched chocolate bars (1 ounce/28 g)
*1 jelly bar (2 ounces/56 g)
*2 fruit cake bars (2 ounces/56 g)
*3 sticks Topps peppermint chewing gum
*3 Domino sugar packets
*3 Nestea &quot;soluble tea product&quot; packets
*1 packet of pure soluble sugar
*1 packet of soluble cream product
*1 bottle water purification tablets (iodine)
*1 plastic bag

==End of the C-ration==
At its introduction, the QMC stated that the C-ration was intended for short-term use for periods not to exceed three days. After the war, in light of field evaluation reports of monotony, the QMC Food Services Branch used this limitation as a defense to the largely negative response to the C-ration during the war, while at the same time advocating standardization on the C-ration as the sole individual packaged ration for U.S. troops. Not only did the QMC decide not to develop or introduce new alternative lightweight individual rations, it successfully campaigned for the elimination of alternatives, including the K-ration, Mountain ration, Jungle ration, and the 10-in-1 group ration (which had proven somewhat useful in boosting nourishment and alleviating complaints of monotony for men living for extended periods on C-rations or K-rations).

Instead, the C-ration, still designated as a packaged ration intended for infrequent or short-term use, went through a series of largely unsuccessful minor revisions. This decision resulted in limiting troops in the field to a single class of packaged ration that despite meal variances was neither suited to varied field environments nor for long-term use. Troops continued to complain of the monotony of a single class of field ration with one or more unpalatable menu items, especially where A and B rations were not available for extended periods.

Primarily implemented due to cost concerns, the selection of a heavy canned wet ration resulted in a severe weight penalty for troops marching on foot and forced to carry a multi-day supply of rations. The overuse of the canned wet ration reached an extreme during the Vietnam War, where American troops resorted to placing stacked ration cans in socks to save bulk and reduce noise on patrol, while their enemy increased their mobility by carrying lightweight rations of dry rice. The Quartermaster Branch&#x27;s insistence on canned wet rations for all postwar field issue and the failure to develop a suitable lightweight dehydrated or other dry ration for jungle and other extreme environments led directly to the hurried development of the LRP ration or Long Range Patrol ration in 1966.

Starting in 1958, C-rations were slowly replaced by the nearly identical canned Meal, Combat, Individual ration.
These rations were issued for most of the next two plus decades, until they were replaced by Meal Ready to Eat or MREs in the Mid 1980s.

==Influence==
The C-rations during the Korean War led later to the introduction of instant coffee to South Korea.

<text>Johann Jakob Bodmer (19 July 16982 January 1783) was a Swiss author, academic, critic and poet.

==Life==
Born at Greifensee, near Zürich, and first studying theology and then trying a commercial career, he finally found his vocation in letters. In 1725 he was appointed professor of Helvetian history at the &quot;Carolinum&quot; academy in Zürich, a chair which he held for half a century, and in 1735 became a member of the Cantonal Council. He died at Zürich in 1783.

==Works==
His major writings are the treatises &quot;Von dem Wunderbaren in der Poesie&quot; (1740; this and following years link to corresponding &quot;[year] in poetry&quot; articles) and &quot;Kritische Betrachtungen über die poetischen Gemählde der Dichter&quot; (1741), in which he pleaded for the freedom of the imagination from the restriction imposed upon it by French pseudo-classicism. Bodmer&#x27;s epics &quot;Die Sundflutz&quot; and &quot;Noah&quot; (both 1751) are imitations of Klopstock&#x27;s &quot;Messias&quot;, and his plays are entirely deficient in dramatic qualities. He also issued editions of the &quot;Minnesingers&quot; and part of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;.

He published (1721–1723), in conjunction with Johann Jakob Breitinger and others, &quot;Die Discourse der Mahlern&quot;, a weekly journal after the model of &quot;The Spectator&quot;. In it, German poetry was severely criticised for its servility to French models. Through his prose translation of Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (&quot;Johann Miltons Episches Gedichte von dem Verlohrnen Paradiese&quot;, 1742), he tried to make English literature accessible in Germany.

He formed a German literary school in opposition to Johann Christoph Gottsched of Leipzig, with whom he carried on a prolonged controversy. 

The controversy between Johann Jakob Bodmer and Johann Christoph Gottsched was one of the most significant literary disputes of the 18th century in Germany. It centered on differing views about the nature and purpose of poetry and literature or Imagination vs. Rationalism.

Bodmer’s View: He championed the freedom of imagination in literature. Bodmer believed that poetry should evoke wonder and engage the emotions, allowing writers creative freedom to explore the sublime and fantastical. He admired English literature, particularly Milton’s Paradise Lost, for its imaginative depth.

Gottsched’s View: Gottsched, based in Leipzig, adhered to French neo-classicism and rationalist principles. He argued that poetry should serve as a tool for moral instruction and adhere to strict rules of form, clarity, and logical structure. He sought to impose order and rationality on German literature, rejecting excesses of imagination.

Bodmer: Advocated for the revival and appreciation of German medieval literature, including the Minnesingers and the Nibelungenlied. He sought to elevate uniquely.

Gottsched: Believed in modeling German literature after French classical ideals, considering them superior to older German works.
Criticism of French Influence

Bodmer and his colleague Johann Jakob Breitinger criticized German poetry for its imitation of French styles and advocated for German writers to break free from this influence.

Gottsched, on the other hand, defended French classicism as a model for literary refinement.

The rivalry was fueled by public debates, pamphlets, and letters exchanged between the two camps, with each accusing the other of misguiding German literature. Gottsched denounced Bodmer’s focus on imagination as promoting chaos and irrationality, while Bodmer criticized Gottsched for stifling creativity and originality with his rigid adherence to rules.

This intellectual clash ultimately helped shape the course of German literature. While Gottsched initially held sway with his rationalist approach, Bodmer’s ideas gradually gained prominence, especially as they resonated with the later Sturm und Drang and Romantic movements, which embraced emotion, imagination, and the sublime in art and literature.

<text>Johann Christoph Gottsched (2 February 1700 – 12 December 1766) was a German philosopher, author, critic and grammarian of the Enlightenment.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
He was born at Juditten (renamed Mendeleyevo in 1947) near Königsberg (Kaliningrad), Brandenburg-Prussia, the son of a Lutheran clergyman, and was baptised in St. Mary&#x27;s Church. He studied philosophy and history at the University of Königsberg, but immediately on taking the degree of &quot;Magister&quot; in 1723, he fled to Leipzig to avoid being drafted into the Prussian army. In Leipzig, he enjoyed the protection of Johann Burckhardt Mencke, who, under the name of &quot;Philander von der Linde&quot;, was a well-known poet and president of the &quot;Deutschübende poetische Gesellschaft&quot; in Leipzig. Of this society, Gottsched was elected &quot;Senior&quot; in 1726, and in the next year reorganised it under the title of the &quot;Deutsche Gesellschaft&quot;.

=== Career ===
As editor of the weeklies &quot;Die vernünftigen Tadlerinnen&quot; (1725–26) and &quot;Der Biedermann&quot; (1727), Gottsched started a lifelong career of untiring critical activity. Directing his criticism at first chiefly at the bombast and absurd affectations of the Second Silesian School, he proceeded to lay down strict laws for the composition of poetry. He insisted German literature be subordinated to the laws of French classicism. He enunciated rules by which the playwright must be bound (such as the &quot;Ständeklausel&quot;), and abolished bombast and buffoonery from the serious stage. He insisted on the observance of the dramatic unities.

In his efforts toward the reformation of the German drama, Gottsched was aided by his wife, Luise, a prolific writer and translator, and had the cooperation of the theatrical manager Johann Neuber and his wife, Caroline. They succeeded in bringing about a considerable change in the condition of the German stage by substituting for the prevailing operatic performances translations of French dramas and original plays, and by banishing from it the coarse buffooneries of Hanswurst (Jack Pudding).

In 1730, Gottsched was appointed an extraordinary professor of poetry, and, in 1734, ordinary professor of logic and metaphysics at the University of Leipzig. He was also a corresponding member of the first learned society of the Habsburg monarchy, the &quot;Societas eruditorum incognitorum&quot; in Olmütz (Olomouc), and was published in the Society&#x27;s journal, which was the first scientific journal in the Habsburg monarchy.

Eventually, Gottsched went too far in his criticism. He refused to recognise the work of Klopstock and Lessing. In 1740, he came into conflict with the Swiss writers Johann Jakob Bodmer and Johann Jakob Breitinger, who, under the influence of Addison and contemporary Italian critics, demanded that the poetic imagination should not be hampered by artificial rules. As examples, they pointed to English poets, especially Milton. Gottsched, although not blind to the beauties of the English writers, clung tenaciously to his principle that poetry must be the product of rules and, in the fierce controversy which for a time raged between Leipzig and Zürich, he was ultimately defeated.

In 1741, he fell out with Caroline Neuber regarding practical stage matters, and even placed himself in opposition to his wife. His influence speedily declined, and before his death his name became proverbial for pedantic folly. He died in Leipzig on 12 December 1766.

==Works==
Gottsched&#x27;s chief work was his &quot;Versuch einer kritischen Dichtkunst für die Deutschen&quot; (1730), the first systematic treatise in German on the art of poetry from the standpoint of Boileau. His &quot;Ausführliche Redekunst&quot; (1728) and his &quot;Grundlegung einer deutschen Sprachkunst&quot; (1748) were of importance for the development of German style and the purification of the language. He wrote several plays, of which &quot;Der sterbende Cato&quot; (1732), an adaptation of Joseph Addison&#x27;s tragedy and a French play on the same theme, was long popular on the stage. His &quot;Deutsche Schaubühne&quot; (6 volumes, 1740–45) contained mainly translations from the French, but also some works written by himself, his wife, and others. With this, he provided the German stage with a classical repertory. His bibliography of the German drama, &quot;Nötiger Vorrat zur Geschichte der deutschen dramatischen Dichtkunst&quot; (1757–65), intended to contain an account of all previous German plays, though not complete is still valuable. He was also the editor of several journals devoted to literary criticism.

Gottsched wrote the texts of two secular cantatas by Johann Sebastian Bach: &quot;Laß, Fürstin, laß noch einen Strahl&quot; (BWV 198) and &quot;Willkommen! Ihr herrschenden Götter der Erden&quot; (BWV Anh. 13, music lost).

==Family==

His first wife, Luise Kulmus, was also a prominent author. She died in 1762. After a three-year mourning period, in 1765 in Camburg, Saale, Gottsched married his 19-year-old second wife, Ernestine Susanne Katharina Neunes (1746–1811).

<text>The huff and puff apparatus is used in school biology labs to demonstrate that carbon dioxide is a product of respiration. A pupil breathes in and out of the middle tube. The glass tubing is arranged in such a way that one flask bubbles as the pupils breathes in, the other as the pupil breathes out. A suitable carbon dioxide indicator, such as limewater or bicarbonate indicator shows the increased presence of carbon dioxide in the outgoing breath. This turns the limewater into milky white substance.

<text>Barthold Heinrich Brockes (September 22, 1680 – January 16, 1747) was a German poet.
He was born in Hamburg and educated at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums. He studied jurisprudence at Halle, and after extensive travels in Italy, France and the Netherlands, settled in Hamburg in 1704. In 1720 he was appointed a member of the Hamburg senate, and entrusted with several important offices. Six years (from 1735 to 1741) he spent as &quot;Amtmann&quot; (bailiff) at Ritzebüttel. He died in Hamburg.

Brockes&#x27; poetic works were published in a series of nine volumes under the fantastic title &quot;Irdisches Vergnügen in Gott&quot; (1721–1748); he also translated Giambattista Marino&#x27;s &quot;La Strage degli innocenti&quot; (1715), Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;Essay on Man&quot; (1740) and James Thomson&#x27;s &quot;The Seasons&quot; (1745). His poetry has small intrinsic value, but it is symptomatic of the change which came over German literature at the beginning of the 18th century. His libretto &quot;Der für die Sünden der Welt gemarterte und sterbende Jesus&quot; (1712), also known as the Brockes Passion, was one of the first passion oratorios—a free, poetic meditation on the passion. It was quite popular and was set to music by Reinhard Keiser (1712), Georg Philipp Telemann (1716), George Frideric Handel (1716), Johann Mattheson (1718), Johann Friedrich Fasch (1723), Gottfried Heinrich Stölzel (1725), and Johann Caspar Bachofen (1759), among others.

He was one of the first German poets to substitute for the bombastic imitations of Marini, to which he himself had begun by contributing, a clear and simple diction. He was also a pioneer in directing the attention of his countrymen to the new poetry of nature which originated in England. His verses, artificial and crude as they often are, express a reverential attitude towards nature and a religious interpretation of natural phenomena which was new to German poetry and prepared the way for Klopstock.

<text>() was an anti-British slogan coined by German poet Ernst Lissauer in 1917 during World War I. The slogan immediately gained widespread popularity in the German Empire, which had been at war with Britain since 1914, and was widely reproduced in Germany&#x27;s popular culture. The Imperial German Army also adopted the slogan as a motto for its soldiers.

== History ==
In August 1914, after the outbreak of World War I, German poet Ernst Lissauer published the anti-British poem &quot;Hassgesang gegen England&quot; (&quot;Song of hate against England&quot;), which in the words of Austrian writer Stefan Zweig &quot;fell like a shell into a munitions depot&quot;. The poem became an instance success in the German Empire as a result of &quot;the rhetorical power with which it encapsulated a national emotional response to the outbreak of war&quot;. Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria, the commander of the Imperial German Army&#x27;s 6th Army, ordered copies of the poem to be distributed to his troops, and Wilhelm II conferred the Order of the Red Eagle upon Lissauer.

Three years after writing the poem, Lissauer coined the slogan &quot;Gott strafe England&quot; (&quot;May God punish England&quot;), which achieved similar levels of popularity in Germany, appearing in popular culture such as cufflinks and postcards and being adopted as a motto by the German army. The slogan, which was commonly chanted by jingoistic crowds in German cities, was met with disapproval among some in the German intelligentsia, with Helmut Herzfeld anglicising his name to John Heartfield in protest. The German government was accused of issuing a stamp with the slogan, which they denied, though a number of unofficial stamps bearing the slogan were produced by non-governmental organisations such as the Federation of the Germans in Lower Austria.

The slogan was humorously adopted by English-speakers to create the term &quot;strafing&quot;, which refers to the military practice of attacking ground targets from low-flying aircraft using automatic weapons; British Army officer William Gott, who served in World War I and World War II, was nicknamed &quot;Strafer&quot; by his comrades after they were exposed to the slogan.

In 1946, British occupational authorities in Hamburg issued eviction orders to make room for a new headquarters. In response, 4,000 residents of the city gathered in protest, singing the outlawed &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot; and knocking the hats off fellow Hamburgers who kept their heads covered. The crowd chanted a variety of slogans, including &quot;We’re not Indians, not coolies, we must be treated like Germans&quot;, antisemitic slogans and &quot;Gott strafe England&quot;. The final slogan led the Royal Military Police to arrest eleven members of the crowd.

== In popular culture ==
Czech writer Jaroslav Hašek made derisive references on the phrase several times in his 1921 novel &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot;: 

English poet J. C. Squire satirizes the phrase in his poem &quot;God Heard the Embattled Nations&quot;:

American artist George Bellows, who made several anti-German works during the war, created a lithograph titled &quot;Gott Strafe (England)&quot; depicting German troops crucifying Allied soldiers.
Louis Raemaekers created a cartoon titled &quot;Gott strafe England&quot;.

<text>Peter Gregg Arnett (born 13 November 1934) is a New Zealand-born American journalist. He is known for his coverage of the Vietnam War and the Gulf War. He was awarded the 1966 Pulitzer Prize in International Reporting for his work in Vietnam from 1962 to 1965, mostly reporting for the Associated Press.

Arnett also worked for &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine, and later for various television networks, most notably for nearly two decades at CNN. Arnett published a memoir, &quot;Live from the Battlefield: From Vietnam to Baghdad, 35 Years in the World&#x27;s War Zones&quot; (1994). In March 1997, Arnett interviewed Osama bin Laden, leader of Al-Qaeda. The journalism school at the Southern Institute of Technology in New Zealand was named for Arnett.

==Early life==
Arnett was born in 1934 in Riverton, in New Zealand&#x27;s Southland region. His first job as a journalist was with &quot;The Southland Times&quot;.

==Vietnam==
During his early years in journalism, Arnett worked in Southeast Asia, largely based in Bangkok. In 1960 he started publishing a small English-language newspaper in Laos. Eventually, he made his way to Vietnam, which the French had abandoned after being defeated at Dien Bien Phu by communists from North Vietnam.

Arnett became a reporter for the Associated Press, based in Saigon in the South, in the years when the United States began to get involved in the civil conflict and through the Vietnam War. On 7 July 1963, in what became known as the Double Seven Day scuffle, he was injured in a widely reported physical altercation between a group of western journalists and South Vietnamese undercover police. The reporters were trying to cover Buddhist protests against the South Vietnamese government. His articles, such as &quot;Death of Supply Column 21,&quot; about an event during Operation Starlite in August 1965, resulted in raising the ire of the American government, which had been increasing the number of forces in the region.

Arnett accompanied troops on dozens of missions, including the battle of Hill 875, in November 1967. An American detachment was sent to rescue another unit that was stranded in hostile territory, and the rescuers were nearly killed during the operation. In September 1972, Arnett joined a group of U.S. peace activists, including William Sloane Coffin and David Dellinger, on a trip to Hanoi, North Vietnam, to accept three American prisoners of war for return to the United States.

Arnett wrote in an unvarnished manner when reporting stories of ordinary soldiers and civilians. Arnett&#x27;s writing was often criticised by administration spokesmen as negative, who wanted to keep reporting of the war positive. General William Westmoreland, President Lyndon B. Johnson and others in power put pressure on the AP to get rid of or transfer Arnett from the region.

In what is considered one of his iconic dispatches, published on 7 February 1968, Arnett wrote about the Battle of Bến Tre: &quot;&#x27;It became necessary to destroy the town to save it,&#x27; a United States major said today. He was talking about the decision by allied commanders to bomb and shell the town regardless of civilian casualties, to rout the Vietcong.&quot; The quotation was gradually altered in subsequent publications, eventually becoming the more familiar, &quot;We had to destroy the village in order to save it.&quot; The accuracy of the original quotation and its source have often been called into question. Arnett never revealed his source, except to say that it was one of four officers he interviewed that day. US Army Major Phil Cannella, the senior officer present at Bến Tre, suggested the quotation might have been a distortion of something he said to Arnett. &quot;The New Republic&quot; at the time attributed the quotation to US Air Force Major Chester L. Brown. In Walter Cronkite&#x27;s 1971 book, &quot;Eye on the World&quot;, Arnett reasserted the quotation was something &quot;one American major said to me in a moment of revelation.&quot;

Arnett was one of the last western reporters remaining in Saigon after its fall and capture by the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam. Occupying soldiers showed him how they had entered the city.

Arnett wrote the 26-part mini-series documentary, &quot;&quot; (1980), produced by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).

==Soviet invasion of Afghanistan==
At the time of the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan, Arnett was working for &quot;Parade&quot; magazine. With a contact named Healy, he entered Afghanistan illegally from Pakistan; both men were dressed in traditional clothing as natives and led by Mujahideen guides. They continued to a Jalalabad hideaway of approximately fifty rebels. The trip came to an end when Healy fell into the Kunar River, ruining the pair&#x27;s cameras. Later, Arnett would recount the story to journalist Artyom Borovik, who was covering the Soviet side of the war.

==Gulf War==
Beginning in 1981, Arnett worked for CNN for 18 years, ending in 1999. During the Gulf War, he became a household name worldwide as the only reporter to have live coverage directly from Baghdad, especially during the first 16 hours. His dramatic reports often were accompanied by the sound of air raid sirens blaring and US bombs exploding in the background. Together with two other CNN journalists, Bernard Shaw and John Holliman, Arnett brought continuous coverage from Baghdad for the 16 initial intense hours of the war (17 January 1991). Although 40 foreign journalists were present at the Al-Rashid Hotel in Baghdad at the time, only CNN possessed the means — a private phone line connected to neighbouring Amman, Jordan — to communicate to the outside world. CNN broadcast Arnett&#x27;s extended call live for several hours, with a picture of Arnett as video. Soon the other journalists left Iraq, including the two CNN colleagues, which left Arnett as the sole remaining reporter.

His accounts of civilian damage caused by the bombing were not well received by the coalition war administration. Its spokesmen had emphasized terms such as &quot;smart bombs&quot; and &quot;surgical precision&quot; in their public statements, in an effort to project keeping civilian casualties would be at a minimum. White House sources would later attack Arnett, saying that he was being used as a tool for Iraqi disinformation.

Two weeks into the war, Arnett was able to obtain an exclusive, uncensored interview with Saddam Hussein. Due to Arnett&#x27;s reporting from the &quot;other side&quot;, for a period of five weeks, the Gulf War was the first to be broadcast live on TV.

About halfway through the war, representatives of the CIA approached Arnett. They believed that the Iraqi military was operating a high-level communication network from the basement of the Al Rashid Hotel, which is where Arnett and other staff from CNN were staying. The CIA wanted him out so the Air Force could bomb the hotel, but Arnett refused. He said he had been given a tour of the hotel and denied there was such a facility.

==Interview with Osama Bin Laden==
In March 1997, Arnett of CNN interviewed Osama bin Laden, leader of Al-Qaeda, after Bin Laden declared jihad on the United States. Asked by Arnett, &quot;What are your future plans?&quot;, Bin Laden said, &quot;You&#x27;ll see them and hear about them in the media, God willing.&quot;

==Operation Tailwind==
In 1998, Arnett narrated a report on the joint venture (between CNN and &quot;Time&quot; magazine) programme called &quot;NewsStand&quot;, covering &quot;Operation Tailwind&quot; in Laos in 1970.

The report, titled &quot;The Valley of Death&quot;, claimed that in 1970, the United States Army had used sarin, a nerve agent, against a group of deserting U.S. soldiers in Laos. The men who allegedly conducted the attack were an elite Green Berets A-Team. The report was expressly approved by both CNN Chairman Tom Johnson and CNN President Rick Kaplan. In response, the Pentagon commissioned another report contradicting that of CNN&#x27;s. CNN subsequently conducted its own investigation. It concluded that the &quot;journalism [in the &quot;Valley of Death&quot;] was flawed&quot; and retracted the story. While all 12 men of the Green Beret A-Team were wounded in action during Operation Tailwind, no sarin was involved.

Due to a number of rebuttals claiming the CNN report was flawed, three or more of the individuals responsible were fired or forced to resign. Arnett was reprimanded, and left the network in April 1999, apparently due to &quot;lingering fallout&quot; from Tailwind.

==Invasion of Iraq 2003==
On assignment for NBC and &quot;National Geographic&quot;, Arnett went to Iraq in 2003 to cover the U.S. invasion. After a press meeting there, he granted an interview to state-run Iraqi TV on 31 March 2003. In it he said:

Earlier in the interview he said:

When Arnett&#x27;s remarks sparked a &quot;firestorm of protest&quot;, NBC initially defended him, saying he had given the interview as a professional courtesy and that his remarks were &quot;analytical in nature&quot;. A day later, though, NBC, MSNBC and &quot;National Geographic&quot; all severed their relationships with Arnett. In response to Arnett&#x27;s statement on Iraqi TV, NBC stated:
Arnett responded:
Later that day, Arnett was hired by the British tabloid, &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot;, which had opposed the war. A couple of days later he also received work from Greek television channel NET television, and Belgian VTM.

==Academic career==
After retiring as a field reporter in 2007, Arnett lives in Los Angeles.

He also teaches journalism at Shantou University in China. In New Zealand, the Peter Arnett School of Journalism was named for him at the Southern Institute of Technology; the journalism school closed in 2015.

==Personal life==
In 1964, Arnett married Nina Nguyen, a Vietnamese woman. They had two children, Elsa and Andrew. Nina and Peter separated in 1983, divorced more than 20 years later, then reconciled in 2006.

Elsa Arnett attended Stuyvesant High School in New York and Harvard University. After graduating, she went into journalism, became a reporter, worked for several months on &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as an intern and then joined &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;. She worked with her father on his 1994 memoir about his reporting life. Elsa Arnett is married to former White House lawyer John Yoo.

In the 2007 New Year Honours, Arnett was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to journalism.

==In popular culture==
Peter Arnett appeared in Robert Wiener&#x27;s book &quot;Live from Baghdad&quot;. He appeared as a character in the 2002 HBO film of the same name, where he was portrayed by actor Bruce McGill.

The book, as well as the film, features Arnett&#x27;s work as part of Wiener&#x27;s crew in Baghdad. Arnett joined the team as tensions between Iraq and the West were escalating toward an imminent military encounter. CNN sent Arnett to Baghdad because of his experience in covering military conflicts. Arnett was part of the live coverage beginning on 16 January 1991, the start of the Gulf War air campaign, where he and colleagues Bernard Shaw and John Holliman kept broadcasting from their Al-Rasheed Hotel room amid extensive aerial bombing by the Western Coalition forces.

Arnett&#x27;s interview with Bin Laden in 1997 became the subject of the movie &#x27;A War Story&#x27; produced for television. Arnett&#x27;s role was played by John Leigh.

<doc id="204064" wikidata="Q7875078" url="?curid=204064" title="USS Vesuvius (1806)">
<text>USS &quot;Vesuvius&quot; was a bomb ketch, and the first ship of the United States Navy named for the Italian volcano.

&quot;Vesuvius&quot; was built by Jacob Coffin at Newburyport, Massachusetts. She was launched on 31 May 1806 and commissioned in or before September 1806, with Lieutenant James T. Leonard in command.

==Service history==
&quot;Vesuvius&quot; departed Boston, Massachusetts, for the Gulf of Mexico, but, while en route on 19 October, ran aground in the Gulf of Abaco. The ship lost her rudder and floated free only after her crew had jettisoned all of her guns and their carriages; her shot and shell; and even part of the kentledge. She finally reached New Orleans, Louisiana, on 27 November.

Repaired and rearmed with ten 6-pounders (2.7 kg), the ship subsequently sailed for Natchez, Mississippi, and operated out of that port from February 1807 until returning to New Orleans on 30 May. &quot;Vesuvius&quot; was then ordered north for further repairs and arrived at New York City on 16 August.

The ship apparently remained in the New York area until the spring 1809, when she again sailed for New Orleans. Embarking upon duties to suppress slave traders and pirates operating out of the trackless bayous, &quot;Vesuvius&quot; cruised off the mouth of the muddy Mississippi River and into the Gulf of Mexico, alert for any sign of illegal activity.

The crew&#x27;s vigilance was rewarded in February 1810 when, under the command of Lieutenant Benjamin F. Read, &quot;Vesuvius&quot; gave chase to a pirate vessel off the mouth of the Mississippi and captured &quot;Duc de Montebello&quot;, a schooner named by Frenchmen who had been expelled from Cuba by the Spanish government. Dispatched to New Orleans, the buccaneer ship was condemned. In the same month, boats from &quot;Vesuvius&quot;, under the command of Midshipman F.H. Gregory, captured pirate schooner &quot;Diomede&quot; and slave ship &quot;Alexandria&quot;, the latter with a full cargo of slaves on board and flying British colors.

Four months later, Commander David Porter, commander of the New Orleans station, embarked in &quot;Vesuvius&quot; before the bomb ketch departed New Orleans on 10 June 1810, bound via Havana, Cuba, for Washington, DC. Also making the passage were Porter&#x27;s wife and the Porters&#x27; ward, eight-year-old James Glasgow Farragut. The lad would later change his name to David Glasgow Farragut and ultimately become the Navy&#x27;s first admiral.

After repairs at the Washington Navy Yard, the ketch pressed on for New York and arrived on 6 September 1810. &quot;Vesuvius&quot; was placed in ordinary, and her crew was transferred to .

In 1816, &quot;Vesuvius&quot; served as a receiving ship at New York. A survey conducted in April 1818 revealed that the cost to repair and refit the ship would be, in the survey&#x27;s words, &quot;exorbitant.&quot; Still carried on the Naval Vessel Registry as a receiving ship through 1821, &quot;Vesuvius&quot; was broken up in June 1829 after being damaged beyond repair on 4 June when the old steamship &quot;Fulton&quot; exploded alongside.

<text>The 1987 United Kingdom general election was held on Thursday 11 June 1987, to elect 650 members to the House of Commons. The election was the third consecutive general election victory for the Conservative Party, who won a majority of 102 seats and second landslide under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher, who became the first Prime Minister since the Earl of Liverpool in 1820 to lead a party into three successive electoral victories.

The Conservatives ran a campaign focusing on lower taxes, a strong economy and strong defence. They also emphasised that unemployment had just fallen below the 3 million mark for the first time since 1981, and inflation was standing at 4%, its lowest level since the 1960s. National newspapers also continued to largely back the Conservative government, particularly &quot;The Sun&quot;, which ran anti–Labour Party articles with headlines such as &quot;Why I&#x27;m backing Kinnock, by Stalin&quot;.

Labour, led by Neil Kinnock following Michael Foot&#x27;s resignation in the aftermath of the party&#x27;s landslide defeat at the 1983 general election, was slowly moving towards a more centrist policy platform, following the promulgation of a left-wing one under Foot&#x27;s leadership. The main aim of the Labour Party was to re-establish itself as the main progressive centre-left alternative to the Conservatives, after the rise of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) forced Labour onto the defensive; and Labour succeeded in doing so at this general election. The Alliance between the SDP and the Liberal Party was renewed, but co-leaders David Owen and David Steel could not agree whether to support either major party in the event of a hung parliament.

The Conservatives were returned to government, having suffered a net loss of only 21 seats, which left them with 376 MPs and a reduced but still strong majority of 102 seats. Labour succeeded in resisting the challenge by the SDP–Liberal Alliance to maintain its position as HM Official Opposition. Moreover, Labour managed to increase its vote share in Scotland, Wales and the North of England. Yet Labour still returned only 229 MPs to Westminster; and in certain London constituencies which Labour had held before the election, the Conservatives actually made gains.

The election was a disappointment for the Alliance, which saw its vote share fall and suffered a net loss of one seat as well as former SDP leader Roy Jenkins losing his seat to Labour. This led to the two Alliance parties merging completely soon afterwards to become the Liberal Democrats. In Northern Ireland, the main unionist parties maintained their alliance in opposition to the Anglo-Irish Agreement; however, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) lost two seats to the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). One of the UUP losses was former Cabinet Minister Enoch Powell, famous for his stance against immigration, and formerly a Conservative MP.

To date the Conservatives have not matched or surpassed their 1987 seat total in any general election held subsequently, although they recorded a greater share of the popular vote in the 2019 general election. This Parliament, the 50th of its kind, would also be the last time that a Conservative government has lasted a full term with an overall majority of seats in Parliament, until the 2015-17 parliament.

The election night was covered live on the BBC, presented by David Dimbleby, Peter Snow and Robin Day. It was also broadcast on ITV, presented by Sir Alastair Burnet, Peter Sissons and Alastair Stewart.

The 1987 general election saw the election of the first Black Members of Parliament: Diane Abbott, Paul Boateng and Bernie Grant, all as representatives for the Labour Party. Other newcomers included future Cabinet members David Blunkett and John Redwood, future Shadow Cabinet minister Ann Widdecombe, and future SNP Leader Alex Salmond. MPs who left the House of Commons as a result of this election include former Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan, Keith Joseph, Jim Prior, Ian Mikardo, former SDP leader and Labour Cabinet Minister Roy Jenkins, former Health Minister Enoch Powell (who had defected to the UUP in Northern Ireland from the Conservatives in 1974) and Clement Freud.

==Campaign and policies==
The Conservative campaign emphasised lower taxes, a strong economy and defence, and also employed rapid-response reactions to take advantage of Labour errors. Norman Tebbit and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi spearheaded the Conservative campaign. However, when on &quot;Wobbly Thursday&quot; it was rumoured a Marplan opinion poll showed a narrow 2% Conservative lead, the &quot;exiles&quot; camp of David Young, Tim Bell and the advertising firm Young &amp; Rubicam advocated a more aggressively anti-Labour message. This was when, according to Young&#x27;s memoirs, Young grabbed Tebbit by the lapels and shook him, shouting: &quot;Norman, listen to me, we&#x27;re about to lose this fucking election.&quot; In his memoirs, Tebbit defends the Conservative campaign: &quot;We finished exactly as planned on the ground where Labour was weak and we were strong—defence, taxation, and the economy.&quot; During the election campaign, however, Tebbit and party leader Margaret Thatcher argued.

Bell and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi produced memorable posters for the Conservatives, such as a picture of a British soldier&#x27;s arms raised in surrender with the caption &quot;Labour&#x27;s Policy On Arms&quot;—a reference to Labour&#x27;s policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament. The first Conservative party political broadcast played on the theme of &quot;Freedom&quot; and ended with a fluttering Union Jack, the hymn &quot;I Vow to Thee, My Country&quot; (which Thatcher would later quote in her &quot;Sermon on the Mound&quot;) and the slogan &quot;It&#x27;s Great To Be Great Again&quot;.

The Labour campaign was a marked change from previous efforts; professionally directed by Peter Mandelson and Bryan Gould, it concentrated on presenting and improving Neil Kinnock&#x27;s image to the electorate. Labour&#x27;s first party political broadcast, dubbed &quot;Kinnock: The Movie&quot;, was directed by Hugh Hudson of &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; fame, and concentrated on portraying Kinnock as a caring, compassionate family man. It was filmed at the Great Orme in Wales and had &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; as its music. He was particularly critical of the high unemployment that the government&#x27;s economic policies had resulted in, as well as condemning the wait for treatment that many patients had endured on the National Health Service. Kinnock&#x27;s personal popularity jumped 16 points overnight following the initial broadcast.

On 24 May, Kinnock was interviewed by David Frost and claimed that Labour&#x27;s alternative defence strategy in the event of a Soviet attack would be &quot;using the resources you&#x27;ve got to make any occupation totally untenable&quot;. In a speech two days later Thatcher attacked Labour&#x27;s defence policy as a programme for &quot;defeat, surrender, occupation, and finally, prolonged guerrilla fighting ... I do not understand how anyone who aspires to Government can treat the defence of our country so lightly&quot;.

During the 1987 election campaign the Conservative Party issued attack posters which claimed that the Labour Party wanted the book &quot;Young, Gay and Proud&quot; to be read in schools, as well as &quot;Police: Out of School&quot;, &quot;The Playbook for Kids about Sex&quot;, and &quot;The Milkman&#x27;s on his Way&quot;, which, according to the Monday Club&#x27;s Jill Knight MP – who introduced Section 28 and later campaigned against same-sex marriage – were being taught to &quot;little children as young as five and six&quot;, which contained &quot;brightly coloured pictures of little stick men showed all about homosexuality and how it was done&quot;, and &quot;explicitly described homosexual intercourse and, indeed, glorified it, encouraging youngsters to believe that it was better than any other sexual way of life&quot;.

==Timeline==
The Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited Buckingham Palace on 11 May and asked the Queen to dissolve Parliament on 18 May, announcing that the election would be held on 11 June. The key dates were as follows:
==Results==
The Conservatives were returned by a second landslide victory after their first in 1983, with a comfortable majority, down slightly on 1983 with a swing of 1.5% towards Labour. This marked the first time since the passing of the Great Reform Act in 1832 that a party leader had won three consecutive elections, although the Conservative Party had won three consecutive contests in the 1950s under different leaders (Churchill in 1951, Eden in 1955 and Macmillan in 1959) and early in the century, the Liberals also had three successive wins under two leaders (Henry Campbell-Bannerman in 1906 and H. H. Asquith twice in 1910). The Conservative lead over Labour of 11.4% was the second-greatest for any governing party since the Second World War; only being bettered by the previous 1983 result.

The BBC announced the result at 02:35. Increasing polarisation marked divisions across the country; the Conservatives dominated Southern England and took additional seats from Labour in London and the rest of the South, but performed less well in Northern England, Scotland and Wales, losing many of the seats they had won there at previous elections. Yet the overall result of this election proved that the policies of Margaret Thatcher retained significant support, with the Conservatives given a third convincing majority.

Despite initial optimism and the professional campaign run by Neil Kinnock, the election brought only twenty additional seats for Labour from the 1983 Conservative landslide. In many southern areas, the Labour vote actually fell, with the party losing seats in London. However, it represented a decisive victory against the SDP–Liberal Alliance and marked out the Labour Party as the main contender to the Conservative Party. This was in stark contrast to 1983, when the Alliance almost matched Labour in terms of votes; although Labour had almost 10 times as many seats as the Alliance due to the structure of the First-Past-The-Post voting system.

The result for the Alliance was a disappointment, in that they had hoped to overtake Labour as the Official Opposition in the UK in terms of vote share. Instead, they lost Roy Jenkins&#x27; seat and saw their vote share drop by almost 3%, with a widening gap of 8% between them and the Labour Party (compared to a 2% gap four years before). These results would eventually lead to the end of the Alliance and the birth of the Liberal Democrats.

Most of the prominent MPs retained their seats. Notable losses included: Enoch Powell (the controversial former Conservative Cabinet Minister who had defected to the Ulster Unionist Party), Gordon Wilson (leader of the Scottish National Party) and two Alliance members: Liberal Clement Freud and former SDP leader Roy Jenkins (a former Labour Home Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer). Neil Kinnock increased his share of the vote in Islwyn by almost 12%. Margaret Thatcher increased her share of the vote in her own seat in Finchley, but the Labour vote increased in the Prime Minister&#x27;s constituency; thereby slightly reducing her majority.

In Northern Ireland, the various unionist parties maintained an electoral pact (with few dissenters) in opposition to the Anglo-Irish Agreement. However, the Ulster Unionists lost two seats to the Social Democratic and Labour Party.

The election victory won by the Conservatives could also arguably be attributed to the rise in average living standards that had taken place during their time in office. As noted by Dennis Kavanagh and David Butler in their study on the 1987 general election:

<text>Johann Martin Lappenberg (July 30, 1794 – November 28, 1865) was a German diplomat, groundbreaking medievalist, and historian with a focus on the early Holy Roman Empire, the Hanseatic League, and Saxon England.

==Biography==
He was born at Hamburg, where his father, Valentin Anton Lappenberg (1759–1819), held an official position. He attended the Johanneum and the Akademisches Gymnasium of Hamburg. Like his father he studied medicine, but afterwards history, at the University of Edinburgh. He continued to study history in London, at Frederick William University of Berlin and at Göttingen, where he graduated as doctor of laws in 1816. In 1820 he was sent by the Hamburg senate as Minister Resident to the Prussian court in Berlin. In 1823 he became keeper of the Hamburg archives. In this office, he had the fullest opportunities for the laborious and critical research work upon which rests his reputation. He was in this office until 1863, when a serious eye problem compelled him to resign. In 1850 he represented Hamburg in the German parliament at Frankfurt, and he died at Hamburg.

==Works==
Lappenberg&#x27;s most important work is his &quot;Geschichte von England&quot;, which deals with the history of England from the earliest times to 1154. This work was published in two volumes at Hamburg in 1834–1837. It has been translated into English by Benjamin Thorpe as &quot;History of England under the Anglo-Saxon Kings&quot; (1845), and &quot;History of England under the Norman Kings&quot; (Oxford, 1857), and was continued in three additional volumes from 1154 to 1509 by R. Pauli.

For the &quot;Monumenta Germaniae historica&quot; he edited the &quot;Chronicon&quot; of Thietmar of Merseburg, the &quot;Gesta Hammenburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot; of Adam of Bremen and the &quot;Chronica Slavorum&quot; of Helmold, with its continuation by Arnold of Lübeck. Lappenberg, who was a member of numerous learned societies in Europe, wrote many other historical works.

These other works deal mainly with the history of Hamburg, particularly during the era of the Hanseatic League, and include:
*&quot;Hamburgische Chroniken in niedersächsischer Sprache&quot; (Hamburg: Perthes &amp; Mauke, 1852–1861; reprint Niederwalluf: Sändig, 1971, )
*&quot;Geschichtsquellen des Erzstiftes und der Stadt Bremen&quot; (Bremen: Heyse, 1841; reprint Aalen: Scientia-Verlag, 1967)
*&quot;Hamburgisches Urkundenbuch&quot; (Hamburg: Perthes, Besser &amp; Mauke, 1842)
*&quot;Urkundliche Geschichte des Hansischen Stahlhofes zu London&quot; (Hamburg: Langhoff, 1851; reprint Osnabrück: Zeller, 1967)
*&quot;Hamburgische Rechtsalterthümer&quot; (Hamburg: Meissner, 1845)
*&quot;Urkundliche Geschichte des Ursprunges der deutschen Hanse&quot; (Hamburg, 1830), as editor, continuation of the work of GF Sartorius.

<text>Benjamin Thorpe (1782 – 19 July 1870) was an English scholar of Anglo-Saxon literature.

==Biography==
In the early 1820s he worked as a banker in the House of Rothschild, in Paris. There he met Thomas Hodgkin, who treated him for tuberculosis.

After studying for four years at Copenhagen University, under the Danish philologist Rasmus Christian Rask, Thorpe returned to England in 1830. In a few years he established a reputation as an Anglo-Saxon scholar.

In recognition of unremunerative work, Thorpe was granted a civil list pension of £160 in 1835, and on 17 June 1841 this was increased to £200 per annum. He was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Munich, and of the Society of Netherlandish Literature at Leyden He died at Chiswick in July 1870.

==Bibliography==
In 1830 Thorpe brought out at Copenhagen an English version of Rask&#x27;s &quot;Anglo-Saxon Grammar&quot; (a second edition of this appeared at London). That same year he moved to London with his new wife Mary Otte and her daughter Elise Otté. Thorpe educated and oppressed his step daughter and she had a troubled relationship and unattributed partnership with him throughout his life.

In 1832 he published at London &quot;Cædmon&#x27;s Metrical Paraphrase of Parts of the Holy Scriptures in Anglo-Saxon; with an English Translation, Notes, and a Verbal Index&quot;, which was well reviewed. It was followed in 1834 by the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Version of the Story of Apollonius of Tyre&quot; and by &quot;Analecta Anglo-Saxonica&quot;, a textbook which was adopted at Oxford by Robert Meadows White. The &quot;Analecta&quot; was used, with Vernon&#x27;s &quot;Anglo-Saxon Guide&quot;, for 40 years.

In 1835 Thorpe published &quot;Libri Psalmorum Versio antiqua Latina&quot; and then &quot;Ancient Laws and Institutes of England&quot; (1840). Two more volumes were published by Thorpe in 1842, &quot;The Holy Gospels in Anglo-Saxon&quot; and &quot;Codex Exoniensis, a Collection of Anglo-Saxon Poetry, with English Translation and Notes&quot;, an edition of the poems in the Exeter Book with English translation. Next came, for the Ælfric Society, &quot;The Homilies of the Anglo-Saxon Church&quot;,&#x27; with an English version, published in ten parts between 1843 and 1846.

In 1834 Thorpe had begun a translation of Johann Martin Lappenberg&#x27;s works on old English history, but was deterred. By 1842 he had started another version, with alterations, corrections, and notes of his own; it was published in two volumes in 1845 as &quot;A History of England under the Anglo-Saxon Kings&quot;. It was followed eventually by a version of Lappenberg&#x27;s &quot;History of England under the Norman Kings&quot; (1857). Thorpe&#x27;s two-volume edition of Florence of Worcester was issued in 1848–49.

For the publisher Edward Lumley Thorpe produced &quot;Northern Mythology&quot; (1851) with notes and illustrations. It was followed in 1853 by &quot;Yule Tide Stories&quot; which appeared in Bohn&#x27;s Antiquarian Library. For the same library he translated in 1854 &quot;Pauli&#x27;s Life of Alfred the Great&quot;, with Alfred&#x27;s Anglo-Saxon version of &quot;Orosius&quot;. In 1855 appeared Thorpe&#x27;s &quot;Anglo-Saxon Poems of Beowulf&quot;, with parallel prose translation, notes, glossary, and indexes. He had planned this work as early as 1830, and his text was collated with the Cottonian MS before John Mitchell Kemble&#x27;s; the scorched edges of the manuscript suffered further shortly afterwards.

In 1861 Thorpe edited for the Rolls Series of &quot;The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, according to the several Authorities&quot;. In the first volume are printed synoptically the Corpus Christi, Cambridge, the Bodleian, and the various Cottonian texts, with facsimiles and notes, while in volume two appeared the translation. Four years later, through the support of Joseph Mayer of Liverpool, Thorpe was able to publish his supplement to Kemble&#x27;s &quot;Codex Diplomaticus ævi Saxonici&quot;. His final work, done for Trübner in 1866, was a translation of the &quot;Elder Edda&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Vesuvius&quot; was a 239-ton steamer acquired by the United States Navy for use during the Mexican–American War which was an armed military conflict between the United States and Mexico from 1846 to 1848 in the wake of the 1845 U.S. annexation of Texas.

&quot;Vesuvius&quot;, outfitted with a heavy mortar that was designed to attack and damage land-based fortifications, was assigned by the Navy to operations in the Mexican battle zones.

== Service history ==
&quot;Vesuvius&quot; – a coastal Cargo ship built in 1845 at Williamsburg, New York, as &quot;Saint Mary&quot; – was acquired by the Navy at New York City in 1846 for use with the blockading squadrons in the Gulf of Mexico. Records of the ship&#x27;s service are sketchy at best, especially for her early service in the Navy. However, reports indicate that she apparently operated as &quot;Vesuvius&quot;, off Vera Cruz, although one source dates her renaming as occurring on 5 January 1847. In August 1846, after many members of her crew contracted yellow fever while she was stationed off Vera Cruz, &quot;Vesuvius&quot; put into Bermuda en route north for recuperation.

She was probably refitted at New York, as records indicate that, under the command of Comdr. George A. Magruder, she departed from that port towards the end of the winter of 1846 and 1847, arriving at Laguna del Carmen, Mexico, on 7 March 1847, for blockade duty. &quot;Vesuvius&quot; was assigned to the port of Laguna. At this juncture, Commodore Matthew Galbraith Perry – commanding the Gulf Squadron—appointed Magruder the military governor of the town, and the commander was of great value to Perry as an administrator. The majority of time spent by &quot;Vesuvius&quot; on the Gulf station was spent at Laguna, where she logged the shipping movements of vessels both inside and outside the harbor.

In the spring of 1847, when Commodore Perry launched his expedition against Tuxpan, &quot;Vesuvius&quot; was withdrawn temporarily from Laguna to support the operation. The Mexicans defending the town with 650 men led by General Cos were ideally situated to command its approaches. The assault on the Mexican defensive works was launched by a 1,500-man landing force drawn from the ships&#x27; crews. Twenty-five officers and men from &quot;Vesuvius&quot;, led by Commander Magruder, took part in this action and were present when the flag of the United States was raised over the captured city. 

Twelve days later, Perry launched an all-out assault against Tabasco, the last remaining large port commanded by the Mexicans on the Gulf coast. Although captured earlier by American forces, Tabasco had fallen again to Mexican hands. After leaving guardships at Coatzacoalcos and Tuxpan, Perry arrived off Frontera on 14 June 1847, at the mouth of the river which led to Tabasco. Shifting his flag again to &quot;Scorpion&quot;, Perry and his squadron commenced the passage up the tortuous channels. At &quot;Devil&#x27;s Bend,&quot; concealed Mexican sharpshooters opened fire from the dense chaparral along the riverbank. &quot;Scorpion&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;Vesuvius&quot;, and the flat-bottomed &quot;surfboats&quot; returned the fire; &quot;Vesuvius&quot;&#x27; 10-inch mortar shells dispersed the snipers; thus allowing the squadron to continue its way upriver. 

At six in the evening, the squadron anchored for the night and arranged barricades about the decks to protect the American sailors against sniper fire. During the night, Mexican forces placed obstructions in the only navigable channel. Meanwhile, landing parties from Perry&#x27;s ships stealthily scaled the steep cliffs which rose from the river. They then rushed the works in a sudden assault which surprised the Mexican troops and put them to flight. During the attack, the gunboats forced their way up the river under the command of Lt. David Dixon Porter, who would later win fame during the American Civil War. Fort Iturbide, mounting six guns, soon fell to a landing force commanded by Lt. Porter, thus clearing the final obstacle from the road to Tabasco. Accordingly, detachments from Scorpion and &quot;Spitfire&quot; took possession of this objective on the 16th.

&quot;Vesuvius&quot; remained in the Gulf of Mexico, at Laguna, through the end of the year 1847. Under the command of Lt. Sylvanus William Godon, the brig captured American schooner &quot;Wasp&quot; on 10 October 1847, which was engaged in illicit trading, and later captured four bungos. &quot;Vesuvius&quot; moved to Campeche on 8 March 1848 and then back to Laguna late in April. She operated there until sailing north in mid-summer. The brig arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 1 August and was sold there the following October.

<text>Helmold of Bosau (c. 1120 – after 1177) was a Saxon historian of the 12th century and a priest at Bosau near Plön. He was a friend of the two bishops of Oldenburg in Holstein, Vicelinus (died 1154) and Gerold (died 1163), who did much to Christianize the Polabian Slavs.

==History==

Helmold was born near Goslar. He grew up in Holstein, and received his instruction in Brunswick from Gerold, the future bishop of Oldenburg (1139–42). Later he came under the direction of Vicelinus, the Apostle of the Wends, first in the Augustinian monastery of Faldera, afterwards known as Neumünster (1147–53). He became a deacon about 1150, and finally became a parish priest in 1156 at Bosau on Großer Plöner See.

At Bishop Gerold&#x27;s instigation Helmold wrote his &quot;Chronica Slavorum&quot;, a history of the conquest and conversion of the Polabian Slavs from the time of Charlemagne (about 800) to 1171. The purpose of this chronicle was to demonstrate how Christianity and the German nationality gradually succeeded in gaining a footing among the Wends, especially in the eastern portion of Holstein. As an eyewitness he gives a clear description in fluent Latin of Vicelinus&#x27;s missionary labors, of the founding of the bishopric in Oldenburg, of the transfer of this bishopric to Lübeck when German commerce at the latter place had become more important than in the former city, of the spread of German influence among the Wends, of the merciless subjugation and extermination of these, and of the summoning to their lands of foreign settlers, principally Westphalian and Dutch. The work is divided into two parts: the first covers a period closing with the year 1168, while the second continues to the year 1171. This second part, however, was written subsequently to 1172.

Helmold was a critical historian, calling Henry the Lion &quot;out for money&quot;, and criticizing the Wendish Crusades. He said that among the troops of Henry the Lion during the Wendish Crusade, there was &quot;only talk of money, never about Christianity&quot; and missionary conversion of the Slavs.

Helmold drew his knowledge of the earliest period from the church history of Adam of Bremen and the Saxon records bearing on Henry IV, besides the life of Willehadus, the list of Ansgarius, and perhaps also a life of Vicelinus, but the summaries which he made of these records are unreliable. He is, however, the most important source of information for the history of his own period, his account of which rests on the verbal information of Vicelinus and of Gerold. His fund of information becomes noticeably meager after the latter&#x27;s death in 1163. His trustworthiness was seriously questioned in the 19th century (see particularly Sehirren, &quot;Beiträge zur Kritik holsteinischer Geschichtsquellen&quot;, Leipzig, 1876) owing to his antagonism towards the Archbishops of Bremen and his partiality for the Oldenburg-Lübeck bishopric, but it should not be supposed that he was guilty of an intentional falsification of facts. The chronicle was first published in 1556 at Frankfurt, and later in &quot;Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores&quot;, XXI (1868), 11-99, and in &quot;Script. rer. Germ.&quot;

Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony, was Helmold&#x27;s patron. The chronicle was continued down to 1209 by Abbot Arnold of Lübeck.
