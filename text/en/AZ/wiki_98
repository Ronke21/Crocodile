<text>:&quot;See Amenemhat, for other individuals with this name.&quot;

Amenemhat III (Ancient Egyptian: &quot;Ỉmn-m-hꜣt&quot; meaning &#x27;Amun is at the forefront&#x27;), also known as Amenemhet III, was a pharaoh of ancient Egypt and the sixth king of the Twelfth Dynasty of the Middle Kingdom. He was elevated to throne as co-regent by his father Senusret III, with whom he shared the throne as the active king for twenty years. During his reign, Egypt attained its cultural and economic zenith of the Middle Kingdom.

The aggressive military and domestic policies of Senusret III, which re-subjugated Nubia and wrested power from the nomarchs, allowed Amenemhat III to inherit a stable and peaceful Egypt. He directed his efforts towards an extensive building program with particular focus on Faiyum. Here he dedicated a temple to Sobek, a chapel to Renenutet, erected two colossal statues of himself in Biahmu, and contributed to excavation of Lake Moeris. He built for himself two pyramids at Dahshur and Hawara, becoming the first pharaoh since Sneferu in the Fourth Dynasty to build more than one. Near to his Hawara pyramid is a pyramid for his daughter Neferuptah. To acquire resources for the building program, Amenemhat III exploited the quarries of Egypt and the Sinai for turquoise and copper. Other exploited sites includes the schist quarries at Wadi Hammamat, amethyst from Wadi el-Hudi, fine limestone from Tura, alabaster from Hatnub, red granite from Aswan, and diorite from Nubia. A large corpus of inscriptions attest to the activities at these sites, particularly at Serabit el-Khadim. There is scant evidence of military expeditions during his reign, though a small one is attested at Kumma in his ninth regnal year. He also sent a handful of expeditions to Punt.

Amenemhat III reigned for at least 45 years, though a papyrus fragment from El-Lahun mentioning a 46th year probably dates to his reign as well. Toward the end of his reign he instituted a co-regency with Amenemhat IV, as recorded in a rock inscription from Semna in Nubia, which equates regnal year 1 of Amenemhat IV to regnal year 44 or 46–48 of Amenemhat III. Sobekneferu later succeeded Amenemhat IV as the last ruler of the Twelfth Dynasty.

== Sources ==
=== Contemporaneous sources ===
There are a variety of contemporary sources attesting to the reign of Amenemhat III. Chief among these are the collection of inscriptions left at mining sites throughout Egypt, Nubia, and the Sinai peninsula. His activities in the Sinai are particularly well attested to, spanning regnal years 2 to 45. It is notable though, that the overwhelming majority of these inscriptions originate outside Egypt. He is also well attested to through his statuary with approximately 80 works attributed to him, his building program, particularly concentrated around Faiyum, and the two pyramids that he had built. The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus – one of a limited set of evidence attesting to Egyptian knowledge of mathematics – is also thought to have been originally composed during Amenemhat III&#x27;s time.

=== Historical sources ===
The Karnak king list from the Festival Hall of Thutmose III (c. 1479–1425 BC) has a lacuna of two entries between Amenemhat II and Amenemhat IV, though three kings are known to have reigned during this period – Senusret II, Senusret III, and Amenemhat III. In the Abydos king list from the temple of Seti I (c. 1290–1279 BC) in Abydos, Amenemhat III is attested by his praenomen &quot;Ni-maat-re&quot; in the sixty-fourth entry. His praenomen also occupies the sixty-fourth entry in the king list at the temple of Ramesses II (c. 1279–1213 BC) in Abydos. In the Saqqara Tablet from the tomb of the chief lector priest and chief of works Tjuneroy, Amenemhat III&#x27;s praenomen occupies the twentieth entry. The Turin Canon has a lacuna in the mid-Twelfth Dynasty preserving no names and only partial reign lengths. The twenty-fifth entry of the fifth column corresponding to Amenemhat III preserves only a regnal length of 40 + x years. The entries of his presumed children and immediate successors – Amenemhat IV and Sobekneferu – are near-wholly intact preserving their praenomen and reign lengths. 

Amenemhat III is also mentioned in Manetho&#x27;s &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;, originally composed circa the 3rd century BC, tentatively dated to the reign of Ptolemy II. The original work is no longer extant, but has persisted through the writings of Josephus, Africanus, Eusebius, and Syncellus. He is accorded a reign of 8 years under the name &quot;Λαχάρης&quot; (romanized Lacharês / Lamarês) by both Africanus and Eusebius. Syncellus accords him a reign of 43 years under the name &quot;Μάρης&quot; (romanized Marês) as the thirty-fifth king of Thebes.

== Family ==
Amenemhat III was the son of Senusret III, his predecessor on the throne. There is no explicit testimony to this filial relationship, however, the inference can be made from their co-regency. The identity of his mother is unknown. He had several sisters – Menet, Mereret, Senetsenbetes, Sithathor, and a partially known Khnemet-. 

Two of Amenemhat III&#x27;s wives are known, Aat and Khenemetneferhedjet III, who were both buried in his Pyramid at Dahshur. Hetepti – the mother of Amenemhat IV – might be another wife. He had one confirmed daughter, Neferuptah, who appears to have been groomed as his successor, owing to her name being enclosed in cartouche. The Egyptologists Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton indicate that Neferuptah was originally buried at Amenemhat III&#x27;s second pyramid at Hawara but was eventually moved to her own pyramid after an early death. The Egyptologist Wolfram Grajetzki contradicts this stating that she was never buried in Hawara, but had possibly outlived her father and was buried elsewhere as a result. Two other children, both of whom reigned as king, are also attributed to Amenemhat III: a son, Amenemhat IV and a daughter, Sobekneferu. It has also been suggested that Amenemhat IV may instead have been a grandson. Evidence of burials of three other princesses – Hathorhotep, Nubhotep, and Sithathor – were found at the Dahshur complex, but it is not clear whether these princesses were Amenemhat III&#x27;s daughters as the complex was used for royal burials throughout the Thirteenth Dynasty.

== Reign ==
=== Chronology ===
The relative chronology of rulers in the Twelfth Dynasty is considered settled. The Ramesside king lists and the Turin Canon are a significant source in determining the relative chronology of the rulers. The Turin Canon has a lacuna of four lines between Amenemhat I and Amenemhat IV, recording only partial regnal lengths for the four kings – 10 + x, 19, 30 + x, and 40 + x years respectively. The king lists of Seti I and Ramesses II at Abydos and the Saqqara tablet each list Amenemhat III with Senusret III – whose praenomen is &quot;Kha-kau-re&quot; – as his predecessor and Amenemhat IV – whose praenomen is Maa-kheru-re – as his successor. Instead Egyptological debate has centred on the existence of co-regencies.

=== Co-regency ===

In his twentieth regnal year, Senusret III elevated his son Amenemhat III to the status of co-regent. The co-regency seems to be established from several indicators, though not all scholars agree and some instead argue for sole reigns for both kings. For the following twenty years, Senusret III and Amenemhat III shared the throne, with Amenemhat III taking the active role as king. It is assumed that Amenemhat III took the primary role as the regnal dates roll over from year 19 of Senusret III to year 1 of Amenemhat III. His reign is attested for at least 45 years, though a papyrus fragment from El-Lahun mentioning &#x27;regnal year 46, month 1 of akhet, day 22&#x27; probably dates to his rule as well, since the village was founded by Amenemhat III&#x27;s grandfather, Senusret II, and no other Twelfth Dynasty ruler after Senusret II reigned for more than 40 years. The highest date might be found on a bowl from Elephantine bearing regnal year 46, month 3 of peret. This attribution is favoured by the Egyptologist Cornelius von Pilgrim, but rejected by the Egyptologist Wolfram Grajetzki who places it in the early Middle Kingdom. In his 30th regnal year, Amenemhat III celebrated his Sed festival which is mentioned in several inscriptions. His reign ends with a brief co-regency with his successor Amenemhat IV. This is evidenced from a rock inscription at Semna which equates regnal year 1 of Amenemhat IV with regnal year 44 or perhaps 46–48 of Amenemhat III.

These two kings – Senusret III and Amenemhat III – presided over the golden age of the Middle Kingdom. Senusret III had pursued aggressive military action to curb incursions from tribes people from Nubia. These campaigns were conducted across several years and were brutal against the native populations, including slaughter of men, enslavement of women and children, and the burning of fields. He also sent a military expedition into Syria-Palestine, enemies of Egypt since the reign of Senusret I. His internal policies targeted the increasing power of provincial governors, transferring power back to the reigning monarch. It is disputed whether he dismantled the nomarchical system. Senusret III also formed the basis for the legendary character Sesostris described by Manetho and Herodotus. As a consequence of Senusret III&#x27;s administrative and military policies, Amenemhat III inherited a peaceful and stable Egypt, which reached its cultural and economic zenith under his direction.

=== Military campaigns ===
There is very little evidence for military expeditions during Amenemhat III&#x27;s reign. One rock inscription records a small mission in regnal year nine. It was found in Nubia, near the fortress of Kumma. The short text reports that a military mission was guided by the &quot;mouth of Nekhen&quot; Zamonth who states that he went north with a small troop and that there were no deaths on the return south. There is a stela dated to regnal 33 that was discovered at Kerma, south of the Third Cataract, discussing the construction of a wall, though this stela must have originated elsewhere as Kerma was beyond Egypt&#x27;s control at this time.

=== Mining expeditions ===

Exploitation of the quarries of Egypt and the Sinai for turquoise and copper peaked during his reign. A collection of more than 50 texts were inscribed at Serabit el-Khadim, Wadi Maghara, and Wadi Nasb. The efforts here were so extensive that near-permanent settlements formed around them. The quarries at Wadi Hammamat (schist), Wadi el-Hudi (amethyst), Tura (limestone), Hatnub (alabaster), Aswan (red granite) and throughout Nubia (diorite) were all also exploited. These all translated into an extensive building program, particularly in the development of Faiyum.

==== Sinai peninsula ====
Amenemhat III&#x27;s activities in the Sinai peninsula are well-attested. There were expeditions to Wadi Maghara in regnal years 2, 30, and 41–43, with one further expedition in an indiscernible 20 + x year. The temple of Hathor was decorated during the expedition in year 2, which is also the only expedition for which the mining of copper is attested. A related inscription found in Ayn Soukhna suggests that the mission originated from Memphis and perhaps crossed the Red Sea to the peninsula by boat. A single expedition in Wadi Nasb is attested to his 20th regnal year. Between 18 and 20 expeditions to Serabit el-Khadim have been attested to Amenemhat III&#x27;s reign: in years 2, 4–8, 13, 15, 20, 23, 25, 27, 30, 38, 40, 44, possibly also 18, 29, and 45, alongside a 10 + x and x + 17 years, and there are many inscriptions whose date is indeterminable.

==== Egypt ====

One inscription dating to year 43 of Amenemhat III&#x27;s reign comes from Tura and refers to the quarrying of limestone there for a mortuary temple, either that at Dahshur or Hawara. A stela retrieved from the massif of Gebel Zeit, south of Ras Ghareb, on the Red Sea coast shows activity at the Galena mines there. The stela bears a partial date suggesting that it was inscribed after regnal year 10.

Several expeditions to Wadi Hammamat where schist was quarried were recorded. These date to regnal years 2, 3, 19, 20 and 33. Three inscriptions from year 19 note the workforce of labourers and soldiers employed and the outcome of the efforts resulting in ten tall seated statues of the king being made. The statues were destined for the Labyrinth at Hawara. A few expeditions were sent to Wadi el-Hudi, south-east of Aswan, at the southern border of Egypt, where amethyst was collected. These enterprises date to regnal years 1, 11, 20, and 28. An expedition was also sent to Wadi Abu Agag, near Aswan, in regnal year 13.

==== Nubia ====
North-west of Abu Simbel and west of Lake Nasser lie the quarries of Gebel el-Asr in Lower Nubia. The site is best known as the source of diorite for six of Khafre&#x27;s seated statues. The locale was also a source of gneiss and chalcedony in the Middle Kingdom. The Chalcedony deposits are also known as &#x27;stela ridge&#x27; as it was a place where commemorative stelae and votive offerings were left. Nine of these commemorative objects date to the reign of Amenemhat III, specifically regnal years 2 and 4.

=== Trade expeditions ===
A stela was discovered at Mersa on the Red Sea coast, by Rosanna Pirelli in 2005 that detailed an expedition to Punt during the reign of Amenemhat III. The expedition was organized by chief steward Senbef. Under his direction, two contingents were formed. The first was led by an Amenhotep and bound for Punt to acquire incense. The second led by a Nebesu was sent to the mines referred to as Bia-Punt to procure exotic metals. There were a total of between two and five expeditions organized during Amenemhat III&#x27;s rule. Two of the stelae recovered from the site are dated indicating activity there in his 23rd and 41st regnal years.

== Building program ==
Amenemhat III&#x27;s building program included monuments in Khatana, Tell el-Yahudiyya, and Bubastis. At Bubastis, Amenemhat III probably built a palace which hosts relief art containing his name. Of note is a relief that depicts Amenemhat III officiating his &quot;sed&quot;-festival. Further works include the enlargement of the temples to Hathor at Serabit el-Khadim and Ptah in Memphis, the construction of a temple in Quban, and the reinforcement of fortresses at Semna. At Elephantine a fragment of stela bearing a building inscription was found dated to his regnal year 44. A very similar inscription from possibly the same year was found at Elkab, which indicates the extension of a defensive wall built by Senusret II. Another find at Elephantine was a door lintel of the Eleventh Dynasty, where Amenemhat III added an inscription dated to his regnal year 34. Inscriptions with the king&#x27;s name have also been uncovered at Lisht, Memphis, and Heracleopolis and statues of the king were found in Thebes. No site, however, received as much attention as Faiyum, with which Amenemhat III is most closely associated.

In Faiyum, Amenemhat built a huge temple dedicated to Sobek at Kiman Faras. He dedicated a chapel to Renenutet at Medinet Madi. This small temple with three chapels is the best preserved of his temple works. It was built toward the end of his reign and completed by his successor, Amenemhat IV. In Biahmu, he built a massive structure with two colossal tall seated quartzite statues of himself. These face Lake Moeris, for which he is credited with excavating, although how much of this work was conducted by Amenemhat III is unknown. The work on Lake Moeris had been inaugurated by Senusret II to link the Faiyum Depression with Bahr Yussef. This project reclaimed land downstream at the edges of Lake Moeris allowing it to be farmed. A naturally formed valley long and wide was converted into a canal to link the depression with Bahr Yussef. The canal was cut to a depth of and given sloped banks at a ratio of 1:10 and an average inclination of 0.01° along its length. It is known as &quot;Mer-Wer&quot; or the Great Canal. The area continued to be used until 230 BC when the Lahun branch of the Nile silted up. Amenemhat III kept close watch on the inundation levels of the Nile, as demonstrated by inscriptions left at Kumma and Semna. The Nile level peaked in his regnal year 30 at , but was followed by a dramatic decline so that it measured by regnal year 40. The most enduring of his works are the two pyramids that he built for himself, the first king since Sneferu in the Fourth Dynasty to build more than one. His pyramids are in Dahshur and Hawara.

== Pyramids ==
=== Dahshur ===

The construction of the pyramid at Dahshur, the &#x27;Black Pyramid&#x27; (Egyptian language: &quot;Sḫm Ỉmn-m-hꜣt&quot; meaning &#x27;Amenemhat is Mighty&#x27; or &quot;Nfr Ỉmn-m-hꜣt&quot; meaning &#x27;Amenemhat is Beautiful&#x27;/&#x27;Perfect One of Amenemhat&#x27;) began in the first year of Amenemhat III&#x27;s reign. The pyramid core was constructed entirely of mudbrick and stabilized through the building of a stepped core rather than with a stone framework. The structure was then encased by thick, fine white Tura limestone blocks held together by wooden dove-tail pegs. The pyramid was given a base length of that was inclined towards the apex at between 54°30′ to 57°15′50″ reaching a height of for a total volume of . The apogee of the structure was crowned, seemingly, by a grey granite pyramidion high. This now resides in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, catalogued as JE 35133. The pyramidion had a band of hieroglyphic text running on all four of its sides. That the name of Amun has been erased on the pyramidion can only be the result of Akhenaten&#x27;s proscription against the god. 
In front of the pyramid, lay a mortuary temple of simple design comprising an offering hall and an open columned courtyard. Surrounding the complex were two mudbrick enclosing walls. From the mortuary temple an open, mudbrick walled causeway led to the valley temple. Beneath the pyramid was built a substructure with an intricate series of passages and chambers, with burial chambers for the king and two queens. The two queens, Aat and an unidentified queen, were buried here and their remains were recovered from their chambers. The king, though, was not buried here. Shortly after the completion of the pyramid superstructure, in around Amenemhat III&#x27;s 15th regnal year, the substructure began to buckle with cracks appearing inside as a result of groundwater seepage. Rushed efforts were made to prevent the structure collapsing, which were successful, but just as Sneferu had decided to do with his Bent Pyramid, Amenemhat III chose to build a new one.

=== Hawara ===

The second pyramid is at Hawara (Egyptian language: Uncertain, possibly &quot;ꜥnḫ Ỉmn-m-hꜣt&quot; &#x27;Amenemhat Lives&#x27;), in the Faiyum Oasis. This pyramid project was begun around Amenemhat III&#x27;s 15th regnal year, after problems with the Dahshur pyramid persisted. The choice of Hawara suggests that the cultivation of Faiyum was complete and that Amenemhat III was diverting resources to that area. The pyramid had a core constructed entirely of mudbrick encased in fine white Tura limestone. The pyramid had a base length of between and with a shallower inclination of between 48° and 52° up to a peak height for a total volume of . The shallower inclination angle was a step taken to guard against the threat of a collapse and avoid a repeat of the failure at Dahshur. Inside the substructure, builders took further precautions, such as lining chamber pits with limestone. The burial chamber was chiselled out of a single quartzite block measuring by by and weighing over .

Before the pyramid lay a mortuary temple, that has been identified as &quot;the Labyrinth&quot; which Classical travellers such as Herodotus and Strabo referred to and which was said to have inspired the &#x27;Labyrinth of Minos&#x27;. The temple was destroyed in antiquity and can only be partially reconstructed. Its floorplan covered an estimated . According to Strabo&#x27;s account, the temple contained as many rooms as there were nomes in Egypt, while Herodotus wrote about being led &#x27;from courtyards into rooms, rooms into galleries, galleries into more rooms, thence into more courtyards&#x27;. A limestone statue of Sobek and another of Hathor were discovered here as were two granite shrines each containing two statues of Amenemhat III. A north-south oriented perimeter wall enclosed the entire complex which thus measured by . The causeway has been identified near the south-west corner of the complex, but neither it nor the valley temple have been investigated.

=== Neferuptah ===
The pyramid of Neferuptah was built south-east of Amenemhat III&#x27;s Hawara pyramid. It was excavated by Nagib Farag and Zaky Iskander in 1956. The superstructure of the pyramid is near completely lost and the substructure was found full of groundwater, but her burial was otherwise undisturbed including both her sarcophagus and funerary equipment.

== Sculpture ==
Amenemhat III and Sensuret III are the best attested rulers of the Middle Kingdom by number of statues, with about 80 statues that can be assigned to the former. The sculpture of Amenemhat III continued the tradition of Senusret III, though it pursued a more natural and expressive physiognomy, while retaining an idealized image. A wide range of stones were used for the sculpture of the king, include white limestone, obsidian, chalcedony and copper alloy. Furthermore, the king introduced new and re-interpreted types of sculptures, many of which were inspired by far older works. Two broad facial types can be assigned to Amenemhat III. An expressive style in which the face of the king has its musculature, bone structure, and furrows clearly marked. This style is evidently inspired by the sculpture of Senusret III. A humanized style in which the face is simplified with few or no folds or furrows and averse to sharp transitions between features. These have a generally softer, more youthful expression.

== Officials ==

The vizier Kheti (&quot;H̱ty&quot;) held office around year 29 of Amenemhat III&#x27;s reign, as is attested on a papyrus from el-Lahun. The papyrus is a business document authored by the vizier in his office discussing payment of two brothers named Ahy-seneb (&quot;Ỉhy-snb&quot;) for their services. At that time one brother, Ahy-seneb Ankh-ren (&quot;ꜥnḫ-rn&quot;), was an &#x27;assistant to the treasurer&#x27;, yet on a later papyrus containing his will, dated to year 44 of Amenemhat III&#x27;s reign, he had become the &#x27;director of works&#x27;. This latter papyrus contains two dates: year 44, month II of Shemu, day 13 and year 2, month II of Akhet, day 18. The latter date refers to the reign of either Amenemhat IV or Sobekneferu. There is one other hieratic text and also a limestone table on which Ahy-seneb Ankh-ren is attested. The other brother, Ahy-seneb Wah (&quot;Wꜣḥ&quot;), was a &quot;wab&quot;-priest and &#x27;superintendent of priestly orders of Sepdu, lord of the East&#x27;.

A further vizier datable to the reign was Ameny (&quot;Ỉmny&quot;). Ameny is attested on two rock inscriptions from Aswan. The first found by Flinders Petrie on the road between Philae and Aswan, and the second found by Jacques de Morgan on the right bank of the river nile between Bar and Aswan. The inscriptions bear the names of his family members, including his wife Sehotepibre Nehy (&quot;Sḥtp-ỉb-rꜥ Nḥy&quot;) who is also attested on a stela in Copenhagen National Museum.

Khnumhotep (&quot;H̱nmw-ḥtp&quot;) was an official that held office for at least three decades from Senusret II&#x27;s first regnal year through to Amenemhat III&#x27;s reign. At the beginning of Senusret II&#x27;s reign he was a chamberlain, but by the end of his life he held both the office of vizier and chief steward. His tomb in Dahshur also attests to many other titles including &#x27;high official&#x27;, &#x27;royal seal-bearer&#x27;, &#x27;chief lector-priest&#x27;, &#x27;master of secrets&#x27;, and &#x27;overseer of the city&#x27;.

The treasurer Ikhernofret (&quot;Y-ẖr-nfrt&quot;) was still in office in the early years of the king&#x27;s reign, as is demonstrated by a funerary stela in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. This official is among the best attested for the Middle Kingdom, though there is little known of his family. His funerary stela is dated to Amenemhat III&#x27;s first regnal year and bears his name along with three of his titles: &#x27;sealbearer of the King of Lower Egypt&#x27;, &#x27;sole friend of the king&#x27;, and &#x27;treasurer&#x27;. The treasurer is mentioned on the funerary stela of an Ameny (&quot;Ỉmny&quot;) &#x27;chief of staff of the bureau of the vizier&#x27;. The latter part of the stela tells of the attendance of Ikhernofret and Sasetet (&quot;Sꜣ-sṯt&quot;) at a feast in Abydos at the instruction of Senusret III after a campaign against Nubia in his regnal year 19. Ameny is also mentioned on the &#x27;stela of Sasetet&#x27; dating to the first year of Amenemhat III, where he still held the same position. Sasetet holds the title &#x27;chief of staff of the bureau of the treasurer&#x27; in that stela. 

Another treasurer under Amenemhat III is Senusretankh (&quot;S-n-wsrt-ꜥnḫ&quot;), who is known from his recently uncovered mastaba at Dahshur, near the pyramid of Senusret III. The surviving fragments of a red granite offering table recovered from the tomb bear the birth and throne names of Amenemhat III. The table further bears numerous other epithets and titles with which the owner connects himself to the king.

Another chief steward, Senbef (&quot;Snb=f&quot;) is known from an expedition stela found at Mersa and from a papyrus document. The stela contains an image of Amenemhat III presenting offerings to the god Min. Behind the king stands another official, Nebsu (&quot;Nbsw&quot;) the &#x27;Overseer of the Cabinet of the Head of the South&#x27;, effectively meaning that he was the head of a workforce. Beneath the image are inscriptions recording two expeditions to Punt alongside the names of the expedition leaders. The leads of the two expeditions are Nebsu himself and his brother Amenhotep (&quot;Ỉmn-htp&quot;), holding the title of &#x27;scribe in charge of the seal of the treasury&#x27;.

<text>Moritz Amsterdam (December 14, 1908 – October 28, 1996) was an American actor, comedian, writer and producer. He played Buddy Sorrell on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; from 1961 to 1966.

==Early life==
Amsterdam was born in Chicago, Illinois, the youngest of the three sons of Max and Jennie (née Finder) Amsterdam, Jewish immigrants from Austria-Hungary. 

He began working in vaudeville in 1922 as the straight man for his older brother&#x27;s jokes. He was a cellist, a skill he used throughout his career. By 1924, he was working in a speakeasy operated by Al Capone.

After being caught in the middle of a gunfight, Amsterdam moved to California and worked writing jokes. His enormous repertoire, and his ability to come up with a joke on any subject, earned him the nickname The Human Joke Machine. He sometimes performed with a mock machine on his chest, hanging by a strap. He turned a hand crank and paper rolled out; he would then pretend to read the machine&#x27;s joke, although actually the paper was blank.

Amsterdam&#x27;s reputation for humor preceded him. Hal Block tells of Amsterdam walking up Sixth Avenue in New York City and meeting an old friend. &quot;Where have you been?&quot; the friend asked. &quot;Sick,&quot; Amsterdam replied, &quot;I&#x27;ve been in bed with a cold.&quot; His friend looked at him and asked, &quot;What&#x27;s so funny about that?&quot;

==Career==
===Radio===
In the late 1940s, Amsterdam had a program on CBS from 9:30 to 10 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesdays and a daily program on WMGM in New York City.

===Television===

Amsterdam had a program on CBS that ended in early 1949.

In 1950, he briefly hosted the comedy-variety show &quot;Broadway Open House&quot;, TV&#x27;s first late-night entertainment show, on NBC. One of the pioneering TV creations of NBC president Pat Weaver, it demonstrated the potential for late-night programming and led to the later development of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

In February 1952, Amsterdam made his dramatic TV debut on an episode of the DuMont Television Network series &quot;Not for Publication&quot;. Also in 1952, he was host of &quot;Breakfast With Music&quot;, a 9 a.m. Monday-Friday program on WNBT-TV in New York City.

In 1957, he appeared as &quot;Jack Connors&quot; in the third episode (&quot;The Three Pretenders&quot;) of the syndicated television sitcom &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot;, with Barbara Eden and Merry Anders.

In 1958, he appeared as saloon manager Lucien Bellingham in an episode of the CBS western series &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot; entitled &quot;The Moor&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. He later guest-starred on the CBS sitcom &quot;Pete and Gladys&quot;, with Harry Morgan and Cara Williams.

His best-known role was as comedy writer Buddy Sorrell on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, a role suggested for him by his friend Rose Marie, who also appeared on the show.

The show&#x27;s creator, Carl Reiner, based the character on his old friend Mel Brooks, with whom he worked on the writing staff of &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;. Like Amsterdam himself, Buddy had a ready quip for any situation, and one of the show&#x27;s most popular running gags was his insult-laden feud with producer Mel Cooley (Richard Deacon). One scene had Mel walking into the writers&#x27; room asking &quot;Well, what have you got for me?&quot; Buddy immediately answered &quot;Hatred!&quot; Buddy was also one of the rare overtly Jewish characters on TV in that era, with one episode revolving around his belated decision to have a Bar Mitzvah. Amsterdam also wrote lyrics for the show&#x27;s theme song, which were never heard on the air, but have been performed by Dick Van Dyke in concert. Van Dyke sang those lyrics on the October 23, 2010, edition of the NPR show &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;. The composer of the tune, Earl Hagen, was made aware of the lyrics when David Van Deusen arranged it as a gift for Dick Van Dyke on his 70th birthday. Van Deusen, the other DVD, shared the story of the lyrics with Hagen after Amsterdam&#x27;s death.

In a November 1970 episode of &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, titled &quot;Did You Hear the One About Danny Partridge?&quot;, Amsterdam played the role of Ziggy Shnurr, a small-time joke writer, whom Danny found in the Yellow Pages after deciding that the family music act needed some comedy during song breaks. The Amsterdam role echoed his Dick Van Dyke character. The episode also guested Hollywood veteran Jackie Coogan.

In a November 1980 episode of &quot;The Littlest Hobo&quot;, entitled &quot;Fast Freddie&quot;, The Hobo discovers a con man (Amsterdam) operating in a small town and tries to foil his plans to rob a doddering senior.

Amsterdam was an occasional panelist on &quot;Match Game&quot; and the short-lived &quot;Can You Top This?&quot; (which he also executive produced) during the 1970s. He appeared as a small-time criminal in several episodes of the soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; in the 1990s. Amsterdam and Rose Marie later appeared as panelists on &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot; and guest-starred together in a February 1996 episode of the NBC sitcom &quot;Caroline in the City&quot; (his final TV appearance).

===Films===
In 1958, Amsterdam appeared in the low-budget film &quot;Machine-Gun Kelly&quot; with Charles Bronson, and he did a notable dramatic turn in the 1960 noir classic &quot;Murder, Inc.&quot; as Catskill nightclub owner Walter Sage, the first victim (according to the film) of the newly minted Murder, Incorporated.

Amsterdam played Cappy, owner of the local nightclub, in two &quot;Beach Party&quot; movies of the 1960s, which were produced by American International Pictures, of which he was vice president. He and Rose Marie also co-starred in the 1966 film &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry, We&#x27;ll Think of a Title&quot;, a comedy co-written and co-produced by Amsterdam. The film features Richard Deacon, their co-star on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, with cameos by the show&#x27;s co-producer Danny Thomas and co-star Carl Reiner as well as Steve Allen, Milton Berle, Irene Ryan and Moe Howard of the Three Stooges. His later roles included appearances in &quot;The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit&quot; (1968), &quot;Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot; (1976), &quot;When Nature Calls&quot; (1985) and &quot;Side by Side&quot; (1988).

==Personal life==
Amsterdam married actress Mabel Todd in 1933; they divorced in 1945 after twelve years of marriage. He married his second wife Kay Patrick in 1949; they remained married until his death in 1996.

===Hanna-Barbera lawsuit===
In 1963, Amsterdam filed a $12,000 lawsuit against Hanna-Barbera for breach of contract; he claimed that he had been cast and signed to the role of George Jetson on &quot;The Jetsons&quot;. Although his contract stipulated that he would be paid $500 an episode, with a guarantee of twenty-four episodes (i.e., a full season) of work, he recorded only one episode before being replaced by George O&#x27;Hanlon. Several sources claimed the change had occurred as a result of sponsor conflict with Amsterdam&#x27;s commitment to &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;. The case had been closed by early 1965 and the court had ruled in favor of Hanna-Barbera.

==Death==
Amsterdam died at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, California, on October 28, 1996, at the age of 87, due to a heart attack.

<doc id="211714" wikidata="Q754197" url="?curid=211714" title="JAG (TV series)">
<text>JAG (U.S. military acronym for Judge Advocate General) is an American legal drama television series with a U.S. Navy theme, created by Donald P. Bellisario and produced by Belisarius Productions in association with Paramount Network Television (now CBS Studios). The series originally aired on NBC for one season from September 23, 1995, to May 22, 1996, and then on CBS for an additional nine seasons from January 3, 1997, to April 29, 2005. The first season was co-produced with NBC Productions (now Universal Television) and was originally perceived as a &quot;Top Gun&quot; meets &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; hybrid series.

In the spring of 1996, NBC cancelled the series after it finished 79th in the ratings, leaving one episode unaired. In December 1996, rival network CBS picked up the series as a midseason replacement and aired 15 new episodes as its second season. For several seasons, &quot;JAG&quot; climbed in the ratings and ultimately ran for nine additional seasons. &quot;JAG&quot; furthermore spawned the hit series &quot;NCIS&quot;, which in turn led to spin-offs &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

In total, 227 episodes were produced over 10 seasons. At the time of the original airing of its fifth season in the United States, &quot;JAG&quot; was seen in over 90 countries worldwide.

==Premise==
The series follows the exploits of the &quot;judge advocates&quot; (i.e. uniformed lawyers) in the Department of the Navy&#x27;s Office of the Judge Advocate General, based in the Washington metropolitan area. In the line of duty, judge advocates can prosecute and defend criminal cases under the jurisdiction of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (arising from the global presence of the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps,) conduct informal and formal investigations, and advise on military operational law.

In the first season, the in-universe JAG headquarters was set in Washington, D.C., while in later seasons, it is located in Falls Church, Virginia. 
The exterior shot for the latter was of the Cravens Estate in Pasadena, which at the time was owned by the American Red Cross. The real-life Office of the Judge Advocate General (OJAG) was and is based at the Washington Navy Yard.

Akin to &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, the plots from many episodes were often &quot;ripped from the headlines&quot; with portions of the plot either resembling or referencing recognizable aspects of actual cases or incidents, such as the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing (&quot;Act of Terror&quot; and &quot;Valor&quot;), the rescue of downed pilot Scott O&#x27;Grady (&quot;Defensive Action&quot;), the Cavalese cable car disaster (&quot;Clipped Wings&quot;), the USS &quot;Iowa&quot; turret explosion (&quot;Into the Breech&quot;), and the Kelly Flinn incident (&quot;The Court-Martial of Sandra Gilbert&quot;).

While not part of the mission of its real-world counterpart, some of the main characters are at times also involved, directly and indirectly, in various CIA intelligence operations, often revolving around the recurring character CIA officer Clayton Webb (played by Steven Culp).

==Production==
===Background and development===
The creator of &quot;JAG&quot;, Donald P. Bellisario, served for four years in the U.S. Marine Corps, and after having worked his way up through advertising jobs, he landed his first network television job as a story editor for the World War II–era series &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot;, where he got a habit of promoting a consistent promilitary stance in a business where he got the perception that &quot;antiwar&quot; and &quot;antisoldier&quot; mentality were the commonplace. The stereotype in the post–Vietnam War era of &quot;crazed Vietnam veterans&quot; was notably subverted, by not just one, but three of the main characters, in &quot;Magnum P.I.&quot;, of which Bellisario was the co-creator. 
Following the cancellation of his series &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;, Bellisario moved his production deal from Universal to Paramount (headed by former Universal executive Kerry McCluggage), and began working on a one-shot screenplay of a murder mystery aboard a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, where the victim was a woman and naval aviator, inspired by the then-current introduction of female fighter pilots onboard aircraft carriers and in the wake of fallout of the Tailhook scandal.

While doing research on which organizational entities would partake in investigative efforts of crimes committed aboard Naval vessels, Bellisario learned that the special agents of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service filled the police role, and the uniformed lawyers, in the Navy&#x27;s Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps, could alternate between the role of defense attorney, prosecutor, and field investigator. Bellisario chose to go ahead with the lawyers and remarked the unique advantages it brought from a story-telling point of view: &quot;Unlike most law shows, I&#x27;ve got a detective, a prosecutor, and a defender.&quot;

===Production===
With the cancellation on NBC and the immediate pick-up by CBS, showrunner Donald P. Bellisario was allowed greater creative freedom in terms in story and casting. While over on NBC, its West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer wanted more action rather than legal drama and imposed a new female lead, Tracey Needham, rather than continuing with Andrea Parker as in the pilot movie. The move over to CBS, with its older skewing audience and its president Les Moonves giving freer reins, allowed Bellisario to retool &quot;JAG&quot; from an emphasis on action stories to character driven stories and building an ensemble cast.

At the start of the third season, JAG moved its production base from the Paramount lot at Melrose Avenue in Hollywood out to Valencia Studios in Santa Clarita in order to save costs and putting more of the budget on screen rather than spending on soundstage rentals. The spin-off series &quot;NCIS&quot; has remained on the same studio facility for its entire duration and was filmed side-by-side with &quot;JAG&quot; for the ninth and tenth season of the latter and the first and second season of the former.

While the scope of the in-universe settings of &quot;JAG&quot; were global, the show was, with only a few exceptions, entirely filmed on location in southern California and mostly within Greater Los Angeles and the studio zone in which unionized film crews can commute without receiving additional remuneration. JAG had around the dawn of millennium two location managers for this task alternating between episodes, Paul F. Brinkman, Jr and Marvin Bernstein. A few examples of buildings acting as stand-in on location shooting are: 
* Park Plaza Hotel, the Gothic revival style building with Art Deco elements (Moscow hotel), 
* Angeles National Forest (Siberian taiga),
* Shrine Auditorium, the masonic temple and large-event venue (Bahrain and various settings in the Middle East),
* Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary building in the Los Feliz district (American Embassy in Rome and various other places in Italy),
* Old Town shopping district in Pasadena (East Coast small towns.) 
The advance of computer-generated imagery (CGI) made the process of removing palm trees and California license plates simpler still. As to how effectively the deception worked according to the showrunner when &quot;JAG&quot; started to air overseas, &quot;we started to get letters from England, from Germany, from the Middle Eastern companies. A lot of these viewers wanted to know: When were we going to shoot in their city?&quot;

It was reported by &quot;Variety&quot; in February 2002 that the average production cost per episode of &quot;JAG&quot; at that time was around $2.6 million.

===Collaboration with the military===
Initially, the producers of &quot;JAG&quot; did not receive any co-operation from the U.S. Department of Defense entertainment media liaison offices, due to sensitivity in light of all the accumulative negative publicity that had been generated from the Tailhook scandal and its aftermath. However, the lack of co-operation from the military was not a show-stopper, as the &quot;JAG&quot; production team, by virtue of being a Paramount Pictures production, had access to the abundant stock footage from the studio&#x27;s motion pictures, which included many films with military content, such as &quot;Top Gun&quot;, &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;, and &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (and the two other Tom Clancy movie adaptations).

In 1997, though, the naval services had begun to change their minds, and began to render support to the production team on a script-by-script basis with the United States Marine Corps more eager than the United States Navy to render production assistance. A primetime network series about Navy lawyers bringing out controversial subjects in a very public arena was during the third season apparently no longer an issue in itself, but as noted by Commander Bob Anderson of the Navy Office of Information West in Los Angeles in a &quot;TV Guide&quot; interview: &quot;We&#x27;re fine with that as long as the bad guys are caught and punished, and the institution of the Navy is not the bad guy&quot;. The Headquarters Marine Corps Entertainment Liaison Office lists &quot;JAG&quot; on their website in its portfolio of collaborations.

The production filmed on regular basis at nearby installations, primarily at Naval Base Ventura County and its two component parts: Naval Air Station Point Mugu and Naval Construction Battalion Center Port Hueneme. Between 12–14 July 1999, three of the lead actors (Elliott, Bell, and Labyorteaux) and crew filmed aboard the nuclear-powered &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class aircraft carrier USS &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; (CVN-74) off the coast of southern California for scenes for the first 3 episodes of the 5th season.

===Series end===

David James Elliott left the show at the end of the 10th season; the show was subsequently not renewed for an 11th season by the network. The show also introduced new younger characters, including former &quot;As the World Turns&quot; star Chris Beetem, and Jordana Spiro from &quot;The Huntress&quot;.

The producers also considered relocating the fictional setting of the show, from Falls Church to Naval Base San Diego. An episode of the final season, &quot;JAG: San Diego&quot; had the main cast, excluding Harm, going to the San Diego naval base and working with the local JAG office there. Though it was reportedly considered as a pilot episode, as a reformat of the show aiming for a younger audience, CBS ultimately decided not to pursue a new series.

Nevertheless, CBS canceled the show on April 4, 2005, after 10 seasons. The final episode, &quot;Fair Winds and Following Seas&quot;, aired on April 29, 2005, and in which Harm and Mac are assigned different stations: Harm in London, Mac in San Diego. They finally confront their feelings and decide to get married. The episode ends with Bud tossing a challenge coin to decide which one would give up his or her military career to be with the other. However, in keeping with &quot;JAG&quot; tradition, the outcome of the toss is never seen, as the screen fades to black, showing only the coin, which bears the inscription &quot;1995 – 2005&quot;, the years the series spanned.

===Postscript===
The result of the coin toss was eventually revealed in the 2019 finale of the of &quot;&quot;, &quot;False Flag&quot;, in which David James Elliott and Catherine Bell both appeared. Mac won the coin toss and Harm resigned his commission and moved with her to San Diego, but later they mutually ended their relationship and Harm rejoined the Navy and is currently serving as the XO of the (fictional) aircraft carrier, USS &quot;Allegiance&quot;. Mac left the Marines to serve as the USMC liaison to the secretary of state, a civilian position at the U.S. Department of State. Harm and Mac had not seen each other in 9 years until video conferencing with each other in their new roles. In the premiere, Harm and Mac reunite in person, share an embrace, and later renew a discussion of their relationship, once again without reaching any conclusions.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
The pilot movie received a moderately positive review in &quot;Variety&quot;, which noted that it &quot;borrows from recent features &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; and &quot;Apollo 13&quot; in being jargon-heavy to help generate atmosphere but as Rabb&#x27;s character is allowed to develop, &quot;JAG&quot; could become one of the season&#x27;s highlights.&quot; Entertainment Weekly was less impressed by the first episodes of the first season and noted that there is, &quot;...nothing new about JAG‘s plots; they’re the sort of good-guy-against-the-establishment stuff you’d expect, with the scripts (including a recent one cowritten by the mystery novelist Robert Crais) a slight cut above most hour-long dramas.&quot;

During its run, &quot;JAG&quot; and its two lead actors (Elliott as &quot;Harm&quot; and Bell as &quot;Mac&quot;) featured on the cover of &quot;TV Guide&quot; on two occasions: July 6, 2002 (&quot;ON THE WINGS OF AMERICAN PRIDE, THE NAVY DRAMA FLIES HIGH&quot;), and on May 3, 2003 (&quot;JAG SOARS! Tough Timely Stories And a Likely Spin-off&quot;). Virginia Heffernan wrote a scathing critique of &quot;JAG&quot; in the liberal progressive online magazine Slate that &quot;As right-wing military propaganda &quot;JAG&quot; operates like socialist realist novels and the barking radio of G. Gordon Liddy: It pounds home its message at deafening volume, razing nuance and stranding viewers with nothing else to think.&quot; Furthermore, that in many episodes it &quot;...typically opens with the suggestion that the military has done something terrible—and the officers in question do show signs of guilt (reticence). But in the end they reveal their absolute innocence and their higher purpose—and both the military and its reticence are exonerated.&quot;

The August 2009 issue of &quot;ABA Journal&quot; ranked the &quot;25 greatest legal TV shows of all time&quot; and &quot;JAG&quot; came in at number 13. &quot;JAG&quot; was on spot 10 out of 20 on a 2018 Wonderwall.com list over &quot;Best TV shows about the military&quot;

===Nielsen ratings===
Seasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of &quot;JAG&quot; on NBC (first season) and CBS (other seasons).
: Note: U.S. network television seasons generally start in late September and end in late May, which coincides with the completion of the May sweeps.

It was noted in 1998 that the largest segment of the audience was those over the age of 55. &quot;JAG&quot; had its highest ever ratings in the fall of 2001 (season 7), beating episodes of &quot;The Practice&quot; airing on ABC in the same timeslot and in symbiosis with the other CBS law dramas on Tuesdays, &quot;Judging Amy&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;. In 2003, the median age audience for &quot;JAG&quot; (along with the other CBS series&#x27; &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Becker&quot;) was 58 years, the second highest median in primetime network television, with only &quot;CBS 60 Minutes&quot; higher up.

===&quot;NCIS&quot; spin-off===

In January 2003, Donald P. Bellisario was developing a &quot;JAG&quot; spin-off, around the work of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. It was aired in April 2003 in a two-part backdoor pilot in which Commander Rabb is arrested, but later vindicated as innocent, for the murder of Lieutenant Singer. The two episodes, titled &quot;Ice Queen&quot; and &quot;Meltdown&quot;, focused on the NCIS team, with most of the JAG regulars as supporting characters. Whereas the episodes of &quot;JAG&quot; are primarily oriented on a mixture of courtroom drama and military activities in the field, &quot;NCIS&quot; episodes are more focused, as the meaning of the acronym suggests, on criminal investigations. &quot;NCIS&quot; also follows a different storytelling format from &quot;JAG&quot;, emphasizing character humor to a larger extent than its parent program. &quot;NCIS&quot; later produced its own spin-offs, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, which shows a further departure from the styles and themes of &quot;JAG&quot;.

The two episodes &quot;Ice Queen&quot; and &quot;Meltdown&quot; were edited down to a one-hour pilot film, which was then used to sell the idea of &quot;NCIS&quot; as a new series to CBS; the pilot used the title, &quot;NCIS – The Beginning&quot;. It was later also used to introduce the show to CBS affiliates and advertisers. It was only broadcast once and is not available on home video.

Excluding the backdoor pilot, few major characters from &quot;JAG&quot; have appeared in the &quot;NCIS&quot; series. Patrick Labyorteaux appeared briefly as Lieutenant Bud Roberts in the &quot;NCIS&quot; first-season episode &quot;Hung Out to Dry&quot; and again – now with the rank of captain – in the season fourteen episode &quot;Rogue&quot;, advising the NCIS team on a legal issue. John M. Jackson returned in May 2013 as retired Rear Admiral A.J. Chegwidden, now a civilian attorney in the private sector hired by Director Vance to provide legal representation for Special Agent Gibbs, in the season ten &quot;NCIS&quot; finale, &quot;Damned If You Do&quot;. Jackson has recurred as A.J. Chegwidden since the eighth season of &quot;&quot;. Chegwidden is a Vietnam-era compatriot of series regulars Hetty Lange (Linda Hunt) and Owen Granger (Miguel Ferrer). David James Elliot and Catherine Bell returned to their roles as Harmon Rabb and Sarah MacKenzie for the first time since &quot;JAG&quot; ended in the last two episodes of .

While several other actors who played major roles on &quot;JAG&quot; have also appeared on &quot;NCIS&quot;, such as Scott Lawrence (Sturgis Turner on &quot;JAG&quot;), Steven Culp (Clayton Webb on &quot;JAG&quot;), Randy Vazquez (Victor Galindez on &quot;JAG&quot;), and Michael Bellisario (Mikey Roberts on &quot;JAG&quot;); they played completely different characters when appearing on &quot;NCIS&quot;. Similarly, after Sean Murray (Donald Bellisario&#x27;s stepson) played a one-off Ensign character in &quot;JAG&quot; season 4, and the recurring character of Danny Walden in season 6, he joined the core cast of &quot;NCIS&quot; during the first season as Tim McGee, and is still on the show as of 2024.

First introduced in the &quot;NCIS&quot; back-door pilot, Alicia Coppola appeared as Navy judge advocate Lieutenant Commander Faith Coleman in several episodes of &quot;NCIS&quot;. Adam Baldwin played the same guest role, Navy SEAL Commander Michael Rainer, in one episode of each show.

===&quot;First Monday&quot; cross-over===
&quot;First Monday&quot; was a short-lived series co-created by Bellisario and Paul Levine about fictional U.S. Supreme Court justices and their clerks, which aired in 2002 and starred James Garner and Joe Mantegna. The character of U.S. Senator Edward Sheffield (Dean Stockwell), who appeared in three episodes of that show, later became a recurring character on &quot;JAG&quot; as the new Secretary of the Navy, starting in season eight.

===&quot;Yes, Dear&quot; tribute===
The sitcom &quot;Yes, Dear&quot; did an episode called &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Jaggy with It&quot; where Greg&#x27;s father Tom (Tim Conway) wins a walk-on role on &quot;JAG&quot;. Catherine Bell guest-starred as herself while David James Elliott, Patrick Labyorteaux, and Scott Lawrence guest-starred as their respective &quot;JAG&quot; characters.

=== &quot;Bette&quot; tribute ===
The second episode of Bette Midler&#x27;s short-lived sitcom &quot;Bette&quot;, titled &quot;And the Winner Is&quot;, had a storyline where her title character wins an award for guest starring in an episode of &quot;JAG&quot;. The award-winning scene shows Bette playing a character who interrogates Harmon Rabb after comedically checking out his posterior. David James Elliott guest stars in this episode-within-an-episode. The episode aired on CBS on October 18, 2000.

==Home media==
On September 1, 1998, the pilot episode of &quot;JAG&quot; was released on VHS cassette in the U.S. by Paramount Home Entertainment. However, no other episodes of the series proper was released on any home entertainment media while show was still in production, allegedly due to syndication deals made with several broadcasters.

Beginning in 2006, CBS Home Entertainment (distributed by Paramount) has released all 10 seasons on DVD in regions 1, 2 and 4. Seasons 1 to 4 are released with a 4:3 aspect ratio, while seasons 5 to 10 have a 16:9 aspect ratio. The region-2 and −4 editions do not have the bonus features (audio commentaries and retrospective interviews) included on the region-1 editions of seasons one and two.

On December 11, 2012, CBS released &quot;JAG: The Complete Series – Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; on DVD in region 1. This collection contains, other than all 227 episodes of the series and the bonus features of the previously released individual season packs, one disc with new bonus features and a booklet with production notes.

On April 14, 2015, CBS Home Entertainment released a repackaged version of the complete series set, at a lower price, in Region 1. It does not include the bonus disc that was part of the original complete series set.

==Soundtrack==
On April 26, 2010, Intrada released an album of music on compact disc from the series, featuring Bruce Broughton&#x27;s theme and his pilot movie score (tracks 1–15) and weekly composer Steven Bramson&#x27;s score from the second-season episode &quot;Cowboys &amp; Cossacks&quot;, including Broughton&#x27;s format music (the main and end title theme and commercial bumper.)

<text>Epoxy is the family of basic components or cured end products of epoxy [[Resin|resins]]. Epoxy resins, also known as polyepoxides, are a class of reactive prepolymers and polymers which contain epoxide groups. The epoxide functional group is also collectively called &quot;epoxy&quot;. The IUPAC name for an epoxide group is an oxirane.

Epoxy resins may be reacted (cross-linked) either with themselves through catalytic homopolymerisation, or with a wide range of co-reactants including polyfunctional amines, acids (and acid anhydrides), phenols, alcohols and thiols (sometimes called mercaptans). These co-reactants are often referred to as hardeners or curatives, and the cross-linking reaction is commonly referred to as curing.

Reaction of polyepoxides with themselves or with polyfunctional hardeners forms a thermosetting polymer, often with favorable mechanical properties and high thermal and chemical resistance. Epoxy has a wide range of applications, including metal coatings, composites, use in electronics, electrical components (e.g. for chips on board), LEDs, high-tension electrical insulators, paintbrush manufacturing, fiber-reinforced plastic materials, and adhesives for structural and other purposes.

The health risks associated with exposure to epoxy resin compounds include contact dermatitis and allergic reactions, as well as respiratory problems from breathing vapor and sanding dust, especially from compounds not fully cured.

== History ==

Condensation of epoxides and amines was first reported and patented by Paul Schlack of Germany in 1934. Claims of discovery of bisphenol-A-based epoxy resins include Pierre Castan in 1943. Castan&#x27;s work was licensed by Ciba, Ltd. of Switzerland, which went on to become one of the three major epoxy resin producers worldwide. In 1946, Sylvan Greenlee, working for the Devoe &amp; Raynolds Company (now part of Hexion Inc.), patented resin derived from bisphenol-A and epichlorohydrin.

== Chemistry ==
Most of the commercially used epoxy monomers are produced by the reaction of a compound with acidic hydroxy groups and epichlorohydrin. First a hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by dehydrohalogenation. Epoxy resins produced from such epoxy monomers are called glycidyl-based epoxy resins. The hydroxy group may be derived from aliphatic diols, polyols (polyether polyols), phenolic compounds or dicarboxylic acids. Phenols can be compounds such as bisphenol A and novolak. Polyols can be compounds such as 1,4-butanediol. Di- and polyols lead to glycidyl ethers. Dicarboxylic acids such as hexahydrophthalic acid are used for diglycide ester resins. Instead of a hydroxy group, also the nitrogen atom of an amine or amide can be reacted with epichlorohydrin.

The other production route for epoxy resins is the conversion of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alkenes with peracids: In contrast to glycidyl-based epoxy resins, this production of such epoxy monomers does not require an acidic hydrogen atom but an aliphatic double bond.

The epoxide group is also sometimes referred to as an &quot;oxirane&quot; group.

=== Bisphenol-based ===
The most common epoxy resins are based on reacting epichlorohydrin (ECH) with bisphenol A,  resulting in a different chemical substance known as bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (commonly known as BADGE or DGEBA). Bisphenol A-based resins are the most widely commercialised resins but also other bisphenols are analogously reacted with epichlorohydrin, for example Bisphenol F.

In this two-stage reaction, epichlorohydrin is first added to bisphenol A (bis(3-chloro-2-hydroxy-propoxy)bisphenol A is formed), then a bisepoxide is formed in a condensation reaction with a stoichiometric amount of sodium hydroxide. The chlorine atom is released as sodium chloride (NaCl) and the hydrogen atom as water.

Higher molecular weight diglycidyl ethers (n ≥ 1) are formed by the reaction of the bisphenol A diglycidyl ether formed with further bisphenol A, this is called prepolymerization:

A product comprising a few repeat units (&quot;n&quot; = 1 to 2) is a viscous, clear liquid; this is called a liquid epoxy resin. A product comprising more repeating units (&quot;n&quot; = 2 to 30) is at room temperature a colourless solid, which is correspondingly referred to as solid epoxy resin.

Instead of bisphenol A, other bisphenols (especially bisphenol F) or brominated bisphenols (e. g. tetrabromobisphenol A) can be used for the said epoxidation and prepolymerisation. Bisphenol F may undergo epoxy resin formation in a similar fashion to bisphenol A. These resins typically have lower viscosity and a higher mean epoxy content per gram than bisphenol A resins, which (once cured) gives them increased chemical resistance.

Important epoxy resins are produced from combining epichlorohydrin and bisphenol A to give bisphenol A diglycidyl ethers.

Increasing the ratio of bisphenol A to epichlorohydrin during manufacture produces higher molecular weight linear polyethers with glycidyl end groups, which are semi-solid to hard crystalline materials at room temperature depending on the molecular weight achieved. This route of synthesis is known as the &quot;taffy&quot; process. The usual route to higher molecular weight epoxy resins is to start with liquid epoxy resin (LER) and add a calculated amount of bisphenol A and then a catalyst is added and the reaction heated to circa . This process is known as &quot;advancement&quot;. As the molecular weight of the resin increases, the epoxide content reduces and the material behaves more and more like a thermoplastic. Very high molecular weight polycondensates (ca. 30,000–70,000 g/mol) form a class known as phenoxy resins and contain virtually no epoxide groups (since the terminal epoxy groups are insignificant compared to the total size of the molecule). These resins do however contain hydroxyl groups throughout the backbone, which may also undergo other cross-linking reactions, e.g. with aminoplasts, phenoplasts and isocyanates.

Epoxy resins are polymeric or semi-polymeric materials or an oligomer, and as such rarely exist as pure substances, since variable chain length results from the polymerisation reaction used to produce them. High purity grades can be produced for certain applications, e.g. using a distillation purification process. One downside of high purity liquid grades is their tendency to form crystalline solids due to their highly regular structure, which then require melting to enable processing.

An important criterion for epoxy resins is the Epoxy value which is connected to the epoxide group content. This is expressed as the &quot;epoxide equivalent weight&quot;, which is the ratio between the molecular weight of the monomer and the number of epoxide groups. This parameter is used to calculate the mass of co-reactant (hardener) to use when curing epoxy resins. Epoxies are typically cured with stoichiometric or near-stoichiometric quantities of hardener to achieve the best physical properties.

=== Novolaks ===
Novolaks are produced by reacting phenol with methanal (formaldehyde). The reaction of epichlorohydrin and novolaks produces novolaks with glycidyl residues, such as epoxyphenol novolak (EPN) or epoxycresol novolak (ECN). These highly viscous to solid resins typically carry 2 to 6 epoxy groups per molecule. By curing, highly cross-linked polymers with high temperature and chemical resistance but low mechanical flexibility are formed due to the high functionality, and hence high crosslink density of these resins.

=== Aliphatic ===
There are two common types of aliphatic epoxy resins: those obtained by epoxidation of double bonds (cycloaliphatic epoxides and epoxidized vegetable oils) and those formed by reaction with epichlorohydrin (glycidyl ethers and esters).

Cycloaliphatic epoxides contain one or more aliphatic rings in the molecule on which the oxirane ring is contained (e.g. 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3&#x27;,4&#x27;-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate). They are produced by the reaction of a cyclic alkene with a peracid (see above). Cycloaliphatic epoxides are characterised by their aliphatic structure, high oxirane content and the absence of chlorine, which results in low viscosity and (once cured) good weather resistance, low dielectric constants and high Tg. However, aliphatic epoxy resins polymerize very slowly at room temperature, so higher temperatures and suitable accelerators are usually required. Because aliphatic epoxies have a lower electron density than aromatics, cycloaliphatic epoxies react less readily with nucleophiles than bisphenol A-based epoxy resins (which have aromatic ether groups). This means that conventional nucleophilic hardeners such as amines are hardly suitable for crosslinking. Cycloaliphatic epoxides are therefore usually homopolymerized thermally or UV-initiated in an electrophilic or cationic reaction. Due to the low dielectric constants and the absence of chlorine, cycloaliphatic epoxides are often used to encapsulate electronic systems, such as microchips or LEDs. They are also used for radiation-cured paints and varnishes. Due to their high price, however, their use has so far been limited to such applications.

Epoxidized vegetable oils are formed by epoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids by reaction with peracids. In this case, the peracids can also be formed in situ by reacting carboxylic acids with hydrogen peroxide. Compared with LERs (liquid epoxy resins) they have very low viscosities. If, however, they are used in larger proportions as reactive diluents, this often leads to reduced chemical and thermal resistance and to poorer mechanical properties of the cured epoxides. Large scale epoxidized vegetable oils such as epoxidized soy and lens oils are used to a large extent as secondary plasticizers and cost stabilizers for PVC.

Aliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins of low molar mass (mono-, bi- or polyfunctional) are formed by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with aliphatic alcohols or polyols (glycidyl ethers are formed) or with aliphatic carboxylic acids (glycidyl esters are formed). The reaction is carried out in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide, analogous to the formation of bisphenol A-diglycidyl ether. Also aliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins usually have a low viscosity compared to aromatic epoxy resins. They are therefore added to other epoxy resins as reactive diluents or as adhesion promoters. Epoxy resins made of (long-chain) polyols are also added to improve tensile strength and impact strength.

A related class is cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, which contains one or more cycloaliphatic rings in the molecule (e.g. 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate). This class also displays lower viscosity at room temperature, but offers significantly higher temperature resistance than the aliphatic epoxy diluents. However, reactivity is rather low compared to other classes of epoxy resin, and high temperature curing using suitable accelerators is normally required. As aromaticity is not present in these materials as it is in Bisphenol A and F resins, the UV stability is considerably improved.

=== Halogenated ===

Halogenated epoxy resins are admixed for special properties, in particular brominated and fluorinated epoxy resins are used.

Brominated bisphenol A is used when flame retardant properties are required, such as in some electrical applications (e.g. printed circuit boards). The tetrabrominated bisphenol A (TBBPA, 2,2-bis(3,5-dibromophenyl)propane) or its diglycidyl ether, 2,2-bis[3,5-dibromo-4-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)phenyl]propane, can be added to the epoxy formulation. The formulation may then be reacted in the same way as pure bisphenol A. Some (non-crosslinked) epoxy resins with very high molar mass are added to engineering thermoplastics, again to achieve flame retardant properties.

Fluorinated epoxy resins have been investigated for some high performance applications, such as the fluorinated diglycidether 5-heptafluoropropyl-1,3-bis[2-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)hexafluoro-2-propyl]benzene. As it has a low surface tension, it is added as a wetting agent (surfactant) for contact with glass fibres. Its reactivity to hardeners is comparable to that of bisphenol A. When cured, the epoxy resin leads to a thermosetting plastic with high chemical resistance and low water absorption. However, the commercial use of fluorinated epoxy resins is limited by their high cost and low Tg.

=== Diluents ===

Epoxy resins diluents are typically formed by glycidylation of aliphatic alcohols or polyols and also aromatic alcohols. The resulting materials may be monofunctional (e.g. dodecanol glycidyl ether), difunctional (1,4-Butanediol diglycidyl ether), or higher functionality (e.g. trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether). These resins typically display low viscosity at room temperature (10–200 mPa.s) and are often referred to as reactive diluents. They are rarely used alone, but are rather employed to modify (reduce) the viscosity of other epoxy resins. This has led to the term &quot;modified epoxy resin&quot; to denote those containing viscosity-lowering reactive diluents. The use of the diluent does effect mechanical properties and microstructure of epoxy resins. Mechanical properties of epoxy resins are generally not improved by use of diluents. Biobased epoxy diluents are also available.

=== Glycidylamine ===

Glycidylamine epoxy resins are higher functionality epoxies which are formed when aromatic amines are reacted with epichlorohydrin. Important industrial grades are triglycidyl-&quot;p&quot;-aminophenol (functionality 3) and &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;′,&quot;N&quot;′-tetraglycidyl-bis-(4-aminophenyl)-methane (functionality 4). The resins are low to medium viscosity at room temperature, which makes them easier to process than EPN or ECN resins. This coupled with high reactivity, plus high temperature resistance and mechanical properties of the resulting cured network makes them important materials for aerospace composite applications.

== Curing ==
 There are several dozen chemicals that can be used to cure epoxy, including amines, imidazoles, anhydrides and photosensitive chemicals. The study of epoxy curing is usually carried out by using differential scanning calorimetry.

In general, uncured epoxy resins have only poor mechanical, chemical and heat resistance properties. However, good properties are obtained by reacting the linear epoxy resin with suitable curatives to form three-dimensional cross-linked thermoset structures. This process is commonly referred to as curing or gelation process. Curing of epoxy resins is an exothermic reaction and in some cases produces sufficient heat to cause thermal degradation if not controlled. Curing does induce residual stress in epoxy systems which have been studied. The induced stresses may be alleviated with flexibilisers.

Curing may be achieved by reacting an epoxy with itself (homopolymerisation) or by forming a copolymer with polyfunctional curatives or &quot;hardeners&quot;. This curing is what produces the qualities of the substance such as resistance, durability, versatility, and adhesion. In principle, any molecule containing a reactive hydrogen may react with the epoxide groups of the epoxy resin. Common classes of hardeners for epoxy resins include amines, acids, acid anhydrides, phenols, alcohols and thiols. Relative reactivity (lowest first) is approximately in the order: phenol &lt; anhydride &lt; aromatic amine &lt; cycloaliphatic amine &lt; aliphatic amine &lt; thiol.

While some epoxy resin/ hardener combinations will cure at ambient temperature, many require heat, with temperatures up to being common, and up to for some specialist systems. Insufficient heat during cure will result in a network with incomplete polymerisation, and thus reduced mechanical, chemical and heat resistance. Cure temperature should typically attain the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the fully cured network in order to achieve maximum properties. Temperature is sometimes increased in a step-wise fashion to control the rate of curing and prevent excessive heat build-up from the exothermic reaction.

Hardeners which show only low or limited reactivity at ambient temperature, but which react with epoxy resins at elevated temperature are referred to as &quot;latent hardeners&quot;. When using latent hardeners, the epoxy resin and hardener may be mixed and stored for some time prior to use, which is advantageous for many industrial processes. Very latent hardeners enable one-component (1K) products to be produced, whereby the resin and hardener are supplied pre-mixed to the end user and only require heat to initiate curing. One-component products generally have shorter shelf-lives than standard 2-component systems, and products may require cooled storage and transport.

The epoxy curing reaction may be accelerated by addition of small quantities of accelerators. Tertiary amines, carboxylic acids and alcohols (especially phenols) are effective accelerators. Bisphenol A is a highly effective and widely used accelerator, but is now increasingly replaced due to health concerns with this substance. The most widely used accelerator is 2,4,6-Tris(dimethylaminomethyl)phenol.

=== Homopolymerisation ===

Epoxy resin may be reacted with itself in the presence of an anionic catalyst (a Lewis base such as tertiary amines or imidazoles) or a cationic catalyst (a Lewis acid such as a boron trifluoride complex) to form a cured network. This process is known as catalytic homopolymerisation. The resulting network contains only ether bridges, and exhibits high thermal and chemical resistance, but is brittle and often requires elevated temperature for the curing process, so finds only niche applications industrially.
Epoxy homopolymerisation is often used when there is a requirement for UV curing, since cationic UV catalysts may be employed (e.g. for UV coatings).

=== Amines ===

Polyfunctional primary amines form an important class of epoxy hardeners. Primary amines undergo an addition reaction with the epoxide group to form a hydroxyl group and a secondary amine. The secondary amine can further react with an epoxide to form a tertiary amine and an additional hydroxyl group. Kinetic studies have shown the reactivity of the primary amine to be approximately double that of the secondary amine. Use of a difunctional or polyfunctional amine forms a three-dimensional cross-linked network.
Aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic amines are all employed as epoxy hardeners. Amine type hardeners will alter both the processing properties (viscosity, reactivity) and the final properties (mechanical, temperature and heat resistance) of the cured copolymer network. Thus amine structure is normally selected according to the application. Overall reactivity potential for different hardeners can roughly be ordered; aliphatic amines &gt; cycloaliphatic amines &gt; aromatic amines, though aliphatic amines with steric hindrance near the amino groups may react as slowly as some of the aromatic amines. Slower reactivity allows longer working times for processors. Temperature resistance generally increases in the same order, since aromatic amines form much more rigid structures than aliphatic amines. Aromatic amines were widely used as epoxy resin hardeners, due to the excellent end properties when mixed with a parent resin. Over the past few decades concern about the possible adverse health effects of many aromatic amines has led to increased use of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amine alternatives. Amines are also blended, adducted and reacted to alter properties and these amine resins are more often used to cure epoxy resins than a pure amine such as TETA. Increasingly, water-based polyamines are also used to help reduce the toxicity profile among other reasons.
=== Anhydrides ===

Epoxy resins may be thermally cured with anhydrides to create polymers with significant property retention at elevated temperatures for extended periods of time. Reaction and subsequent crosslinking occur only after opening of the anhydride ring, e.g. by secondary hydroxyl groups in the epoxy resin. Homopolymerization may also occur between epoxide and hydroxyl groups. The high latency of anhydride hardeners makes them suitable for processing systems which require addition of mineral fillers prior to curing, e.g. for high voltage electrical insulators. Cure speed may be improved by matching anhydrides with suitable accelerators. For dianhydrides, and to a lesser extent, monoanhydrides, non-stoichiometric, empirical determinations are often used to optimize dosing levels. In some cases, blends of dianhydrides and monoanhydrides can improve metering and mixing with liquid epoxy resins.

=== Phenols ===

Polyphenols, such as bisphenol A or novolacs can react with epoxy resins at elevated temperatures (), normally in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting material has ether linkages and displays higher chemical and oxidation resistance than typically obtained by curing with amines or anhydrides. Since many novolacs are solids, this class of hardeners is often employed for powder coatings.

=== Thiols ===

Also known as mercaptans, thiols contain a sulfur which reacts very readily with the epoxide group, even at ambient or sub-ambient temperatures. While the resulting network does not typically display high temperature or chemical resistance, the high reactivity of the thiol group makes it useful for applications where heated curing is not possible, or very fast cure is required e.g. for domestic DIY adhesives and chemical rock bolt anchors. Thiols have a characteristic odour, which can be detected in many two-component household adhesives.

== Applications ==

The applications for epoxy-based materials are extensive and they are considered very versatile. The applications include coatings, adhesives and composite materials such as those using carbon fiber and fiberglass reinforcements (although polyester, vinyl ester, and other thermosetting resins are also used for glass-reinforced plastic). The chemistry of epoxies and the range of commercially available variations allows cure polymers to be produced with a very broad range of properties. They have been extensively used with concrete and cementitious systems. In general, epoxies are known for their excellent adhesion, chemical and heat resistance, good-to-excellent mechanical properties and very good electrical insulating properties. Many properties of epoxies can be modified (for example silver-filled epoxies with good electrical conductivity are available, although epoxies are typically electrically insulating). Variations offering high thermal insulation, or thermal conductivity combined with high electrical resistance for electronics applications, are available.

As with other classes of thermoset polymer materials, blending different grades of epoxy resin, as well as use of additives, plasticizers or fillers is common to achieve the desired processing or final properties, or to reduce cost. Use of blending, additives and fillers is often referred to as &quot; formulating&quot;.

All quantities of mix generate their own heat because the reaction is exothermic. Large quantities will generate more heat and thus greatly increase the rate of the reaction and so reduce working time (pot-life). So it is good practice to mix smaller amounts which can be used quickly to avoid waste and to be safer. There are various methods of toughening them, as they can be brittle. Rubber toughening is a key technology used for toughening.

=== Paints and coatings ===

Two part epoxy coatings were developed for heavy duty service on metal substrates and use less energy than heat-cured powder coatings. These systems provide a tough, protective coating with excellent hardness. One part epoxy coatings are formulated as an emulsion in water, and can be cleaned up without solvents.

Epoxy coatings are often used in industrial and automotive applications since they are more heat resistant than latex-based and alkyd-based paints. Epoxy paints tend to deteriorate, known as &quot;chalking out&quot;, due to UV exposure. Epoxy coatings have also been used in drinking water applications. Epoxy coatings find much use to protect mild and other steels due to their excellent protective properties.

Change in color, known as yellowing, is a common phenomenon for epoxy materials and is often of concern in art and conservation applications. Epoxy resins yellow with time, even when not exposed to UV radiation. Significant advances in understanding yellowing of epoxies were achieved by Down first in 1984 (natural dark aging) and later in 1986 (high-intensity light aging). Down investigated various room-temperature-cure epoxy resin adhesives suitable for use in glass conservation, testing their tendency to yellow. A fundamental molecular understanding of epoxy yellowing was achieved, when Krauklis and Echtermeyer discovered the mechanistic origin of yellowing in a commonly used amine epoxy resin, published in 2018. They found that the molecular reason for epoxy yellowing was a thermo-oxidative evolution of carbonyl groups in the polymeric carbon–carbon backbone via a nucleophilic radical attack.

Polyester epoxies are used as powder coatings for washers, driers and other &quot;white goods&quot;. Fusion Bonded Epoxy Powder Coatings (FBE) are extensively used for corrosion protection of steel pipes and fittings used in the oil and gas industry, potable water transmission pipelines (steel), and concrete reinforcing rebar. Epoxy coatings are also widely used as primers to improve the adhesion of automotive and marine paints especially on metal surfaces where corrosion (rusting) resistance is important. Metal cans and containers are often coated with epoxy to prevent rusting, especially for foods like tomatoes that are acidic. Epoxy resins are also used for decorative flooring applications such as terrazzo flooring, chip flooring, and colored aggregate flooring.

Epoxies have been modified in a variety of ways, including reacting with fatty acids derived from oils to yield epoxy esters, which were cured the same way as alkyds. Typical ones were L8 (80% linseed) and D4 (40% dehydrated castor oil). These were often reacted with styrene to make styrenated epoxy esters, used as primers. Curing with phenolics to make drum linings, curing esters with amine resins and pre-curing epoxies with amino resins to make resistant top coats. Organic chains maybe used to hydrophobically modify epoxy resins and change their properties. The effect of chain length of the modifiers has been studied.

=== Adhesives ===
Epoxy adhesives are a major part of the class of adhesives called &quot;structural adhesives&quot; or &quot;engineering adhesives&quot; (that includes polyurethane, acrylic, cyanoacrylate, and other chemistries.) These high-performance adhesives are used in the construction of aircraft, automobiles, bicycles, boats, golf clubs, skis, snowboards, and other applications where high strength bonds are required. Epoxy adhesives can be developed to suit almost any application. They can be used as adhesives for wood, metal, glass, stone, and some plastics. They can be made flexible or rigid, transparent or opaque/colored, fast setting or slow setting. Epoxy adhesives are better in heat and chemical resistance than other common adhesives. In general, epoxy adhesives cured with heat will be more heat- and chemical-resistant than those cured at room temperature. The strength of epoxy adhesives is degraded at temperatures above .

Some epoxies are cured by exposure to ultraviolet light. Such epoxies are commonly used in optics, fiber optics, and optoelectronics.

=== Industrial tooling and composites ===

Epoxy systems are used in industrial tooling applications to produce molds, master models, laminates, castings, fixtures, and other industrial production aids. This &quot;plastic tooling&quot; replaces metal, wood and other traditional materials, and generally improves the efficiency and either lowers the overall cost or shortens the lead-time for many industrial processes. Epoxies are also used in producing fiber-reinforced or composite parts. They are more expensive than polyester resins and vinyl ester resins, but usually produce stronger and more temperature-resistant thermoset polymer matrix composite parts. Machine bedding to overcome vibrations is a use in the form of epoxy granite.

=== Wind turbine technology composites ===

Epoxy resins are used as bonding matrix along with glass or carbon fiber fabrics to produce composites with very high strength to weight characteristics, allowing longer and more efficient rotor blades to be produced. In addition, for offshore and onshore wind energy installations, epoxy resins are used as protective coatings on steel towers, base struts and concrete foundations. Aliphatic polyurethane top coats are applied on top to ensure full UV protection, prolong operational lifetimes and lowering maintenance costs. Electric generators, connected via the drivetrain with the rotor blades, convert mechanical wind energy to usable electric energy, and rely on epoxies electrical insulation and high thermal resistance properties. The same applies to transformers, bushings, spacers, and composites cables connecting the windmills to the grid. In Europe, wind energy components account for the largest segment of epoxy applications, about 27% of the market.

=== Electrical systems and electronics ===

Epoxy resin formulations are important in the electronics industry, and are employed in motors, generators, transformers, switchgear, bushings, insulators, printed wiring boards (PWB), and semiconductor encapsulants. Epoxy resins are excellent electrical insulators and protect electrical components from short circuiting, dust and moisture. In the electronics industry epoxy resins are the primary resin used in overmolding integrated circuits, transistors and hybrid circuits, and making printed circuit boards. The largest volume type of circuit board—an &quot;FR-4 board&quot;—is a sandwich of layers of glass cloth bonded into a composite by an epoxy resin. Epoxy resins are used to bond copper foil to circuit board substrates, and are a component of the solder mask on many circuit boards.

Flexible epoxy resins are used for potting transformers and inductors. By using vacuum impregnation on uncured epoxy, winding-to-winding, winding-to-core, and winding-to-insulator air voids are eliminated. The cured epoxy is an electrical insulator and a much better conductor of heat than air. Transformer and inductor hot spots are greatly reduced, giving the component a stable and longer life than unpotted product.

Epoxy resins are applied using the technology of resin dispensing.

=== Petroleum &amp; petrochemical ===

Epoxies can be used to plug selective layers in a reservoir which are producing excessive brine. The technique is named &quot;water shut-off treatment&quot;.

=== Consumer and marine applications ===

Epoxies are sold in hardware stores, typically as a pack containing separate resin and hardener, which must be mixed immediately before use. They are also sold in boat shops as repair resins for marine applications. Epoxies typically are not used in the outer layer of a boat because they deteriorate by exposure to UV light. They are often used during boat repair and assembly, and then over-coated with conventional or two-part polyurethane paint or marine-varnishes that provide UV protection.

There are two main areas of marine use. Because of the better mechanical properties relative to the more common polyester resins, epoxies are used for commercial manufacture of components where a high strength/weight ratio is required. The second area is that their strength, gap filling properties and excellent adhesion to many materials including timber have created a boom in amateur building projects including aircraft and boats.

Normal gelcoat formulated for use with polyester resins and vinylester resins does not adhere to epoxy surfaces, though epoxy adheres very well if applied to polyester resin surfaces. &quot;Flocoat&quot; that is normally used to coat the interior of polyester fibreglass yachts is also compatible with epoxies.

Epoxy materials tend to harden somewhat more gradually, while polyester materials tend to harden quickly, particularly if a lot of catalyst is used. The chemical reactions in both cases are exothermic.

While it is common to associate polyester resins and epoxy resins, their properties are sufficiently different that they are properly treated as distinct materials. Polyester resins are typically low strength unless used with a reinforcing material like glass fibre, are relatively brittle unless reinforced, and have low adhesion. Epoxies, by contrast, are inherently strong, somewhat flexible and have excellent adhesion. However, polyester resins are much cheaper.

Epoxy resins typically require a precise mix of two components which form a third chemical to get the stated properties. Depending on the properties required, the ratio may be anything from 1:1 or over 10:1, but in usually they must be mixed exactly. The final product is then a precise thermoset plastic. Until they are mixed the two elements are relatively inert, although the &#x27;hardeners&#x27; tend to be more chemically active and should be protected from the atmosphere and moisture. The rate of the reaction can be changed by using different hardeners, which may change the nature of the final product, or by controlling the temperature.

By contrast, polyester resins are usually made available in a &#x27;promoted&#x27; form, such that the progress of previously-mixed resins from liquid to solid is already underway, albeit very slowly. The only variable available to the user is to change the rate of this process using a catalyst, often Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone-Peroxide (MEKP), which is very toxic. The presence of the catalyst in the final product actually detracts from the desirable properties, so that small amounts of catalyst are preferable, so long as the hardening proceeds at an acceptable pace. The rate of cure of polyesters can therefore be controlled by the amount and type of catalyst as well as by the temperature.

As adhesives, epoxies bond in three ways: a) Mechanically, because the bonding surfaces are roughened; b) by proximity, because the cured resins are physically so close to the bonding surfaces that they are hard to separate; c) ionically, because the epoxy resins form ionic bonds at an atomic level with the bonding surfaces. This last is substantially the strongest of the three. By contrast, polyester resins can only bond using the first two of these, which greatly reduces their utility as adhesives and in marine repair.

=== Construction applications ===

Epoxies have been researched and used for construction for a few decades. Although they increase cost of mortars and concrete when used as an additive, they enhance properties. Research is ongoing to investigate the use of epoxies and other recycled plastics in mortars to enhance properties and recycle waste. Densifying plastic materials such as PET and plastic bags and then using them to partially replace aggregate and depolymerizing PET to use as a polymeric binder in addition to epoxy to enhance concrete are actively being studied.

=== Aerospace applications ===

In the aerospace industry, epoxy is used as a structural matrix material which is then reinforced by fiber. Typical fiber reinforcements include glass, carbon, Kevlar, and boron.
Epoxies are also used as a structural glue. Materials like wood, and others that are &#x27;low-tech&#x27; are glued with epoxy resin. Epoxies generally out-perform most other resin types in terms of mechanical properties and resistance to environmental degradation.

=== Biology ===

Water-soluble epoxies such as Durcupan are commonly used for embedding electron microscope samples in plastic so they may be sectioned (sliced thin) with a microtome and then imaged.

=== Art ===

Epoxy resin, mixed with pigment, may be used as a painting medium, by pouring layers on top of each other to form a complete picture. It is also used in jewelry, as a doming resin for decorations and labels, and in decoupage type applications for art, countertops, and tables. Its seamless and glossy finish, along with its ability to be molded into various shapes, makes epoxy resin a favored choice for creating minimalist and statement pieces in modern furniture design and into various other design styles, including industrial, rustic, and even eclectic. It has been used and studied for art and historic structure preservation.

== Production ==

The global epoxy resin market was valued at approximately $8 billion in 2016. The epoxy resin market is dominated by the Asia-Pacific region, which contributes 55.2% of the total market share. China is the major producer and consumer globally, consuming almost 35% of the global resin production. The global market is made up of approximately 50–100 manufacturers of basic or commodity epoxy resins and hardeners. In Europe, about 323,000 tonnes of epoxy resin were manufactured in 2017 generating some €1,055 million in sales. Germany is the largest market for epoxy resins in Europe, followed by Italy, France, the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and Austria.

These commodity epoxy manufacturers mentioned above typically do not sell epoxy resins in a form usable to smaller end users, so there is another group of companies that purchases epoxy raw materials from the major producers and then compounds (blends, modifies, or otherwise customizes) epoxy systems from these raw materials. These companies are known as &quot;formulators&quot;. The majority of the epoxy systems sold are produced by these formulators and they comprise over 60% of the dollar value of the epoxy market. There are hundreds of ways that these formulators can modify epoxies—by adding mineral fillers (talc, silica, alumina, etc.), by adding flexibilizers, viscosity reducers, colorants, thickeners, accelerators, adhesion promoters, etc. These modifications are made to reduce costs, to improve performance, and to improve processing convenience. As a result, a typical formulator sells dozens or even thousands of formulations—each tailored to the requirements of a particular application or market.

The raw materials for epoxy resin production are today largely petroleum derived, although some plant derived sources are now becoming commercially available (e.g. plant derived glycerol used to make epichlorohydrin).

== Renewable, recycled, waterborne and biobased epoxy ==
As there is a general trend to renewable and &quot;green&quot; sources and greater use of biobased materials, research is ongoing in the epoxy arena too. Waterborne epoxy paints have been around since the 1970s and research is ongoing. There is also movement to use waste as well as recycled raw materials where possible. Waste granite filings are produced in the mining industry. Research is being done on innovative solutions such as using waste granite powders in epoxy resins and designing binders for coatings based on this. Other work is ongoing to produce epoxy and epoxy based coatings from recycled raw materials including PET bottles. Monomers for epoxy resins can be derived from several different biomass sources.

== Health risks ==
Liquid epoxy resins in their uncured state are mostly classed as irritant to the eyes and skin, as well as toxic to aquatic organisms. Solid epoxy resins are generally safer than liquid epoxy resins, and many are classified non-hazardous materials. One particular risk associated with epoxy resins is sensitization. The risk has been shown to be more pronounced in epoxy resins containing low molecular weight epoxy diluents. Exposure to epoxy resins can, over time, induce an allergic reaction. Sensitization generally occurs due to repeated exposure (e.g. through poor working hygiene or lack of protective equipment) over a long period of time. Allergic reaction sometimes occurs at a time which is delayed several days from the exposure. Allergic reaction is often visible in the form of dermatitis, particularly in areas where the exposure has been highest (commonly hands and forearms). Epoxy use is a main source of occupational asthma among users of plastics. Safe disposal also needs considering but usually involves deliberate curing to produce solid rather than liquid waste.

<text>Mary Elizabeth Alexander Dole (née Hanford; born July 29, 1936) is an American attorney, author, and politician
who served as a United States Senator from North Carolina from 2003 to 2009. A member of the Republican Party, she previously served in five presidential administrations, including as U.S. Secretary of Transportation under President Ronald Reagan from 1983 to 1987 and as U.S. Secretary of Labor under Reagan&#x27;s successor, George H. W. Bush, from 1989 until 1990. Dole then left government to serve as president of the American Red Cross from 1991 to 1999; she departed from that position to seek the Republican nomination in the 2000 presidential election, but eventually withdrew from the race.

Dole graduated from Duke University in 1958 and earned a Juris Doctor degree from Harvard Law School in 1965. Throughout her public career, she was the first woman to hold a number of positions, including secretary of transportation, becoming the first woman to serve in two different presidential cabinet positions for two presidents after being appointed secretary of labor, as well as the first female U.S. senator from North Carolina and chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. She was also the third female secretary of labor and just the second woman to lead the American Red Cross since its founder, Clara Barton. She is the widow of U.S. Senator Bob Dole from Kansas, who served as the Republican Senate leader and was the party&#x27;s presidential nominee in the 1996 election and vice presidential nominee in the 1976 election.

==Early life and education==
Dole was born Mary Elizabeth Alexander Hanford in Salisbury, North Carolina, on July 29th, 1936, to Mary Ella (&quot;née&quot; Cathey; 1901–2004) and John Van Hanford (1893–1978).

Dole attended Duke University and graduated with distinction in political science on June 2, 1958. She was a finalist for an Angier B. Duke scholarship, a full-tuition award given to outstanding applicants who matriculate at Duke. She was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and was a recipient of the Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award, a national prize given to those exemplifying the ideal of service to others.

Among her activities at Duke were the chapel choir, &quot;Chanticleer&quot; (yearbook) business staff, freshman advisory council, the Order of the White Duchy (a local honorary society for outstanding women student leaders, a female counterpart of the Order of the Red Friars), Phi Kappa Delta (a local leadership honorary for senior women), and Pi Sigma Alpha (a national political-science honorary society). Dole is a sister of Delta Delta Delta. She was also elected president of the woman&#x27;s student government association, 1958 May queen, and &quot;leader of the year&quot; by the student newspaper, &quot;The Chronicle&quot;. Dole has remained involved with Duke University, serving at various points in time as president of the Duke University alumnae association, and a member of the board of trustees and board of visitors. She has spoken formally at Duke several times.

Following her graduation from Duke, she did her post-graduate work at Oxford in 1959. After Oxford, she took a job as a student teacher at Melrose High School in Melrose, Massachusetts, for the 1959–1960 school year. While teaching, she also pursued her master&#x27;s degree in education from Harvard University, which she earned in 1960, followed by a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1965. At graduation, she was one of 24 women in a class of 550 students. She is an alumna of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society.

==White House years==

===Johnson administration===
Dole, who had campaigned for the Kennedy–Johnson presidential ticket in 1960, began working in 1967 as a staff assistant to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.

===Nixon and Ford administrations===
When many Democrats left the White House following Richard Nixon&#x27;s replacement of Johnson, Dole did not. From 1969 to 1973, she served as deputy assistant to President Nixon for consumer affairs. In 1973, Nixon appointed her to a seven-year term on the Federal Trade Commission.
Dole first met her future husband, Bob Dole, in the spring of 1972 at a meeting arranged by her boss and mentor, Virginia Knauer. The couple dated, and she became his second wife on December 6, 1975, in the Washington National Cathedral. They had no children, though she is stepmother to Bob&#x27;s adult daughter Robin from his first marriage of 24 years, which ended in divorce in 1972. She attended individually, and later with her husband, the Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C., before joining the National Presbyterian Church in 1996. Articles at the time reported that the Doles stopped attending Foundry in 1995, finding the pastor at the time, J. Philip Wogaman, too liberal.

In 1975, she became a Republican. She took a leave from her post as a Federal Trade Commissioner for several months in 1976 to campaign for her husband for vice president of the United States, when he ran on the Republican ticket with Gerald Ford. She later resigned from the FTC in 1979, to campaign for her husband&#x27;s 1980 presidential run. During the 1970s, Dole was a self-described member of the Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement and helped reform laws to ensure equal credit for women. She was also a supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution.

===Reagan administration and Secretary of Transportation===
She served as director of the White House Office of Public Liaison, from 1981 to 1983 and as United States Secretary of Transportation from 1983 to 1987 under Ronald Reagan. She was also appointed by Reagan to chair task forces that sought to reform federal and state laws to ensure equal rights for women. She was the first woman appointed Secretary of Transportation. In this role, she was the first woman to have served as the head of a branch of the United States military, as the United States Coast Guard was under the Department of Transportation at the time. Dole&#x27;s appointment was &quot;particularly irritating&quot; to conservative activists, since &quot;though at least nominally opposed to abortion, [she was] viewed by the right as [an] aggressive feminist.&quot;

During her tenure, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration mandated the installation of a center high-mounted stop lamp on new cars; these are sometimes called &quot;Liddy Lights&quot; in her recognition. She worked with MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) to pass laws withholding federal highway funding from any state that had a drinking age below 21. The state government of South Dakota opposed the drinking age law and sued Dole in the case &quot;South Dakota v. Dole&quot;, but the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Dole. She oversaw the privatization of the national freight railroad, Conrail. She initiated random drug testing within the Department of Transportation. By 1984 Dole had stopped trying to get Reagan to support the Equal Rights Amendment. She was quoted in the press that year saying, &quot;He&#x27;s not going to change on that.&quot;

===Bush administration and Secretary of Labor===
Dole served as United States Secretary of Labor from 1989 to 1990 under George H. W. Bush; she is the first woman to serve in two different Cabinet positions in the administrations of two presidents. Her tenure as both U.S. Transportation Secretary and U.S. Labor Secretary focused heavily on improving public safety and workplace safety and health.

==American Red Cross presidency==
In 1991, Dole became the president of the American Red Cross. She served until 1999. She was the second woman to serve as president since Clara Barton founded the organization in 1881. She restructured the world&#x27;s largest humanitarian organization during her eight years as president, serving as a volunteer in her first year. She also led a transformation of the way the Red Cross collects, tests, and distributes one-half of the nation&#x27;s blood supply.

==1996 Republican National Convention==
Dole&#x27;s husband Bob Dole was the Republican nominee in the US presidential election of 1996. Elizabeth Dole, who would have become First Lady had her husband won the election, or the Second Lady of the United States, had Gerald Ford won the 1976 election, received recognition for her speech at the 1996 Republican National Convention, during which she walked out into the audience while talking conversationally about her husband&#x27;s qualities.

==2000 United States presidential candidacy==
Elizabeth Dole ran for the Republican nomination in the 2000 United States presidential election.

Speculation of a presidential campaign became widespread after Dole announced her departure from her job as president of the Red Cross on January 4, 1999.

Dole announced she was forming an exploratory committee on March 10, 1999.

While Dole had been an active participant in her husband&#x27;s campaign four years prior, he was largely absent from the campaign trail during her campaign.

In August, Dole placed thirdbehind George W. Bush and Steve Forbesin a large field in the Iowa Straw Poll (the first, non-binding, test of electability for the Republican Party nomination). The Iowa Straw Poll differed from the national polls where she was second only to Bush; Senator John McCain was in third place.

Dole withdrew from race in October 1999 before any of the primaries, largely due to inadequate fundraising even though a Gallup poll had her in second place in the presidential race at 11% behind George W. Bush at 60% as late as October 1999.

==2000 vice presidential vetting==

Shortly before the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Bush campaign sources said Elizabeth Dole was on the short list to be named the vice-presidential nominee, along with Michigan Governor John Engler, New York Governor George Pataki, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, and former Missouri Senator John Danforth. Many pundits believed that Dole was the frontrunner for the vice presidential nomination. Bush then surprised most pundits by selecting former U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, who was actually in charge of leading Bush&#x27;s search for a vice presidential nominee.

==United States Senate career==
===2002 Senate campaign===

In late December 2001, Dole shifted her official residency from the Doles&#x27; condominium in the Watergate complex to her mother&#x27;s home in Salisbury to seek election to the U.S. Senate. The seat was made available by the retirement of Republican Jesse Helms. Although Dole had not lived regularly in North Carolina since 1959 and had been a resident of the Washington area for most of the time since the mid-1960s, the state and national Republican establishment quickly cleared the field for her. She handily won the Republican primary with 80 percent of the vote over a lesser-known candidate, Ada Fisher. In the November general election, she defeated her Democratic opponent Erskine Bowles, a former chief of staff to former President Bill Clinton, by an eight-point margin.

Her election to the Senate marked the first time a spouse of a former Senator was elected to the Senate from a different state from that of her spouse. (Although Kansas Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum married former Tennessee Senator Howard Baker, the marriage occurred after Kassebaum and Baker both had finished their service in the Senate.) Dole was criticized by Democrats (including then-North Carolina Senator John Edwards and her challenger, Erskine Bowles) during her first Senate campaign over the fact that for over 40 years prior to her nomination, she had not lived in North Carolina.

In November 2004, following Republican gains in the United States Senate, Dole narrowly edged out Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota for the post of chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. She is the first woman to become chair of the NRSC. During her election cycle as chairperson, her Democratic Party counterpart, Senator Chuck Schumer raised significantly more money, and experienced more success in recruiting candidates. In the November election, Dole&#x27;s party lost six U.S. Senate seats to the Democrats, thus losing control of the U.S. Senate. Dole was replaced as NRSC chair by Senator John Ensign of Nevada following the 2006 midterms.

===2008 Senate re-election campaign===

Dole was initially a heavy favorite for re-election, especially after several potential top-tier challengers such as Congressman Brad Miller, Governor Mike Easley and former Governor Jim Hunt all declined to compete against Dole. Ultimately, Kay Hagan, a state senator from Greensboro, won the Democratic primary election against Jim Neal and became Dole&#x27;s general election opponent. Reports late in the campaign suggested that Dole suffered from Barack Obama&#x27;s decision to aggressively contest North Carolina in the presidential election, while Hagan received substantial support from independent 527 groups lobbying/advertising against Dole, as well as the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, which spent more money in North Carolina than in any other state during the 2008 election season. Dole undertook an eight-day &quot;ElizaBus&quot; tour of the state in the days leading up to election day.

In late October, Dole released a controversial television ad attacking Hagan for reportedly taking donations from individuals involved in the Godless Americans PAC, a group that advocates for the rights of people who do not believe in God. The ad also included a female voice saying, &quot;There is no god.&quot; Hagan&#x27;s campaign said the ad sought to put inflammatory words in their candidate&#x27;s mouth. Hagan, who was a member of the Presbyterian Church and a former Sunday school teacher, condemned the ad as &quot;fabricated and pathetic,&quot; and, according to Hagan&#x27;s campaign website, a cease-and-desist letter was &quot;hand-delivered to Dole&#x27;s Raleigh office and to her home at the Watergate in Washington, DC.&quot; Hagan also filed a lawsuit in Wake County Superior Court accusing Dole of defamation and libel. The ad met significant criticism from some members of the public as well as national media outlets. After the first ad Hagan received over 3,600 contributions, including major donors as well as individual support from a range of persons who believed in the right to participate in civil government free of religious orthodoxy requirements. Following the second ad Hagan&#x27;s lead doubled according to some polls.

In the 2008 election, Dole lost by a wider-than-expected margin, taking 44 percent of the vote to Hagan&#x27;s 53 percent. It has been speculated that the outcry over the &quot;Godless&quot; ad contributed to Dole&#x27;s loss. Hagan trounced Dole in the state&#x27;s five largest counties – Mecklenburg, Wake, Guilford, Forsyth and Durham. Hagan also dominated most of the eastern portion of the state, which had been the backbone of Helms&#x27; past Senate victories. While Dole dominated the Charlotte suburbs and most of the heavily Republican Foothills region, it was not enough to save her seat.

===Political positions===
Dole&#x27;s voting record was somewhat more conservative than that of her husband, though slightly less conservative than that of Helms. She has a lifetime rating of 92 from the American Conservative Union.

Dole worked with other senators such as Chuck Hagel to draft and attempt to pass legislation reforming housing financing regulation; the bill did not go up for a vote.

In September 2008, Dole joined the Gang of 20, a bipartisan group working towards comprehensive energy reform, which pushed for a bill that would encourage state-by-state decisions on offshore drilling and authorize billions of dollars for conservation and alternative energy.

As a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, Dole is credited with helping to prevent any closures of North Carolina military bases despite threats from the Department of Defense. In 2007, she sponsored legislation which would have granted federal recognition of a North Carolina Native American tribe, the Lumbee based in Robeson County.

===Committee assignments===
Dole was a member of the following U.S. Senate committees:
* U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services
** Emerging Threats and Capabilities
** Personnel
** Readiness and Management Support
* U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs
** Financial Institutions
** Housing, Transportation, and Community Development
** Security and International Trade and Finance
* U.S. Senate Select Committee on Aging
* U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship

==After politics: Elizabeth Dole Foundation==
In 2012, Dole established the Elizabeth Dole Foundation, dedicated to helping caregivers of &quot;wounded warriors&quot;.

Dole commissioned the RAND Corporation to develop the first nationwide comprehensive, evidence-based report on the needs of military and veteran caregivers. The two-year study includes an environmental scan of available services, a gap analysis, and recommendations for meeting the enormous challenges of America&#x27;s hidden helpers – the young spouses, mothers, fathers and other loved ones caring for those who cared for us. The study was generously supported by the Wounded Warrior Project, the Lilly Endowment, and the Cannon Foundation.

The foundation selects military and veteran caregivers from each state to serve a two-year Fellowship with the foundation. The Dole Fellows represent a vast array of military caregivers: spouses, parents, siblings and friends, and use their voice to help bring awareness on a national scale. The foundation also has a National Coalition Program to bring together private and public entities to create substantial change. in 2022 the foundation selected and began working with the civil rights icon and veteran Bobby Grier.

Actor Tom Hanks joined the foundation&#x27;s Hidden Heroes Campaign to bring awareness to the over 5.5 million military caregivers across America who are facing enormous challenges every day caring for members of the military and gravely injured veterans.

<text>A mechanical puzzle is a puzzle presented as a set of mechanically interlinked pieces in which the solution is to manipulate the whole object or parts of it. While puzzles of this type have been in use by humanity as early as the 3rd century BC, one of the most well-known mechanical puzzles of modern day is the Rubik&#x27;s Cube, invented by the Hungarian architect Ernő Rubik in 1974. The puzzles are typically designed for a single player, where the goal is for the player to discover the principle of the object, rather than accidentally coming up with the right solution through trial and error. With this in mind, they are often used as an intelligence test or in problem solving training.

== History ==
The oldest known mechanical puzzle comes from Greece and appeared in the 3rd century BC.
The game consists of a square divided into 14 parts, and the aim was to create different shapes from these pieces. This is not easy to do. (see Ostomachion loculus Archimedius)

In Iran &quot;puzzle-locks&quot; were made as early as the 17th century AD.

The next known occurrence of puzzles is in Japan. In 1742 there is a mention of a game called &quot;Sei Shona-gon Chie No-Ita&quot; in a book. Around the year 1800 the Tangram puzzle from China became popular, and 20 years later it had spread through Europe and America.

The company Richter from Rudolstadt began producing large amounts of Tangram-like puzzles of different shapes, the so-called &quot;Anker-puzzles&quot; in about 1891.

In 1893, , using the pen name &quot;Professor Hoffman&quot;, wrote a book called &quot;Puzzles; Old and New&quot;. It contained, among other things, more than 40 descriptions of puzzles with secret opening mechanisms. This book grew into a reference work for puzzle games and modern copies exist for those interested.

The beginning of the 20th century was a time in which puzzles were greatly fashionable and the first patents for puzzles were recorded.

With the invention of modern polymers manufacture of many puzzles became easier and cheaper.

In 1993, Jerry Slocum founded the Slocum Puzzle Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to educating the public on puzzles through puzzle collecting, exhibitions, publications, and communications.

== Categories ==
=== Assembly ===
In this category, the puzzle is present in component form, and the aim is to produce a certain shape. The Soma cube made by Piet Hein, the Pentomino by Solomon Golomb and the aforementioned laying puzzles Tangram and &quot;Anker-puzzles&quot; are all examples of this type of puzzle.
Furthermore, problems in which a number of pieces have to be arranged so as to fit into a (seemingly too small) box are also classed in this category.
The image shows an example of Hoffman&#x27;s packing puzzle. The aim is to pack 27 cuboids with side lengths formula_1 into a box of side length formula_2, subject to two constraints:

:1) formula_1 must not be equal
:2) The smallest of formula_1 must be larger than formula_5

One possibility would be formula_6 – the box would then have to have the dimensions 30×30×30.

Modern tools such as laser cutters allow the creation of complex two-dimensional puzzles made of wood or acrylic plastic. In recent times this has become predominant and puzzles of extraordinarily decorative geometry have been designed. This makes use of the multitude of ways of subdividing areas into repeating shapes.

Computers aid in the design of new puzzles. A computer allows an exhaustive search for solution – with its help a puzzle may be designed in such a way that it has the fewest possible solutions, or a solution requiring the most steps possible. The consequence is that solving the puzzle can be very difficult.

The use of transparent materials enables the creation of puzzles, in which pieces have to be stacked on top of each other. The aim is to create a specific pattern, image or colour scheme in the solution. 
For example, one puzzle consists of several discs in which angular sections of varying sizes are differently coloured. The discs have to be stacked so as to create a colour circle (red-&gt;blue-&gt;green-&gt;red) around the discs.

====Pyramid puzzles====
A pyramid puzzle consists of two or more component pieces which fit together to create a pyramid. Two-piece pyramid puzzles cannot form a regular pyramid and can only form a 4 faced tetrahedron pyramid.
The solution involves facing the square faces to each other and twisting one upright to complete the four faced tetrahedronic pyramid. There are also four-piece pyramid puzzles.

=== Disassembly ===
The puzzles in this category are usually solved by opening or dividing them into pieces. This includes those puzzles with secret opening mechanisms, which are to be opened by trial and error. Furthermore, puzzles consisting of several metal pieces linked together in some fashion are also considered part of this category.

The two puzzles shown in the picture are especially good for social gatherings, since they appear to be very easily taken apart, but in reality many people cannot solve this puzzle. The problem here lies in the shape of the interlocking pieces – the mating surfaces are tapered, and thus can only be removed in one direction. However, each piece has two oppositely sloping tapers mating with the two adjoining pieces so that the piece cannot be removed in either direction.

Boxes called secret boxes or puzzle boxes with secret opening mechanisms, extremely popular in Japan, are included in this category. These caskets contain more or less complex, usually invisible opening mechanisms which reveal a small hollow space on opening. There is a vast variety of opening mechanisms, such as hardly visible panels which need to be shifted, inclination mechanisms, magnetic locks, movable pins which need to be rotated into a certain position up and even time locks in which an object has to be held in a given position until a liquid has filled up a certain container.

=== Interlocking ===
In an interlocking puzzle, one or more pieces hold the rest together, or the pieces are mutually self-sustaining. The aim is to completely disassemble and then reassemble the puzzle. Both assembly and disassembly can be difficult – contrary to assembly puzzles, these puzzles usually do not just fall apart easily. The level of difficulty is usually assessed in terms of the number of moves required to remove the first piece from the initial puzzle. Later puzzles introduced elements of rotation.

The known history of these puzzles reaches back to the beginning of the 18th century. In 1803 a catalog by &quot;Bastelmeier&quot; contained two puzzles of this type. Professor Hoffman&#x27;s puzzle book mentioned above also contained two interlocking puzzles.

At the beginning of the 19th century the Japanese took over the market for these puzzles. They developed a multitude of games in all kinds of different shapes – animals, houses and other objects – whereas the development in the western world revolved mainly around geometrical shapes.
With the help of computers, it became possible to analyze complete sets of games played. This process was begun by Bill Cutler with his analysis of all the Chinese wood knots. From October 1987 to August 1990 all the 35,657,131,235 different variations were analyzed by computer. With shapes different from the Chinese cross the level of difficulty reached levels of up to 100 moves for the first piece to be removed, a scale humans would struggle to grasp. The peak of this development is a puzzle in which the addition of a few pieces doubles the number of moves. Prior to the 2003 publication of the RD Design Project by Owen, Charnley and Strickland, puzzles without right angles could not be efficiently analyzed by computers.

Stewart Coffin has been creating puzzles based upon the rhombic dodecahedron since the 1960s. These made use of strips with either six or three edges. These kinds of puzzles often have extremely irregular components, which come together in a regular shape only at the last step. Furthermore, the 60° angles allow designs in which several objects have to be moved at the same time. The &quot;Rosebud&quot; puzzle is a prime example of this: in this puzzle 6 pieces have to be moved from one extreme position, in which they are only touching at the corners, to the center of the completed object.

=== Disentanglement ===


For puzzles of this kind, the goal is to disentangle a metal or string loop from an object. Topology plays an important role with these puzzles. The image shows a version of the derringer puzzle. Although simple in appearance, it is quite challenging – most puzzle sites rank it among their hardest puzzles.

Vexiers are a different sort of disentanglement puzzle – two or more metal wires, which have been intertwined, are to be untangled. They, too, spread with the general puzzle craze at the end of the 19th century. A large number of the Vexiers still available today originate in this period.

So-called ring puzzles, of which the Chinese rings are part, are a different type of Vexier. In these puzzles a long wire loop must be unsnarled from a mesh of rings and wires. The number of steps required for a solution often has an exponential relationship with the number of loops in the puzzle. The common type, which connects the rings to a bar with cords (or loose metal equivalents) has a movement pattern identical to the Gray binary code, in which only one bit changes from one code word relative to its immediate neighbor.

A noteworthy puzzle, known as the Chinese rings, Cardans&#x27; rings, the Baguenaudier or the Renaissance puzzle was mentioned in circa 1500 as Problem 107 of the manuscript by Luca Pacioli. The puzzle is again referred to by Girolamo Cardano in the 1550 edition of his book . Although the puzzle is a disentanglement-type puzzle, it also has mechanical puzzle attributes, and the solution can be derived as a binary mathematical procedure.

The Chinese rings are associated with the tale that in the Middle Ages, knights would give these to their wives as a present, so that in their absence they may fill their time. Tavern puzzles, made of steel, are based on forging exercises that provided good practice for blacksmith apprentices.

Niels Bohr used disentanglement puzzles called Tangloids to demonstrate the properties of spin to his students.

===Fold===

The aim in this particular genre of puzzles is to fold a printed piece of paper in such a way as to obtain a target picture. In principle, Rubik&#x27;s Magic could be counted in this category. A better example is shown in the picture. The task is to fold the square piece of paper so that the four squares with the numbers lie next to each other without any gaps and form a square.

Another folding puzzle is folding prospectuses and city maps. Despite the often visible folding direction at the folding points it can be extraordinarily difficult to put the paper back into the form with which it originally came. The reason these maps are difficult to restore to their original state is that the folds are designed for a paper-folding machine, in which the optimum folds are not of the sort an average person would try to use.

===Lock===

These puzzles, also called trick locks, are locks (often padlocks) which have an unusual locking mechanism. The aim is to open the lock. If you are given a key, it will not open the lock in the conventional way. For some locks it may then be more difficult to restore the original situation.

===Trick vessels===
These are vessels &quot;with a twist&quot;. The aim is to either drink or pour from a container without spilling any of the liquid. Puzzle containers are an ancient form of game. The Greeks and Phoenicians made containers which had to be filled via an opening at the bottom. In the 9th century a number of different containers were described in detail in a Turkish book. In the 18th century the Chinese also produced these kinds of drinking containers.

One example is the puzzle jug: the neck of the container has many holes which make it possible to pour liquid into the container, but not out of it. Hidden to the puzzler&#x27;s eye, there is a small tubular conduit all the way through the grip and along the upper rim of the container up to the nozzle. If one then blocks the opening at the upper end of the grip with one finger, it is possible to drink liquid from the container by sucking on the nozzle.

Other examples include the fuddling cup and the pot crown.

=== Impossible objects ===
Impossible objects are objects which at first sight do not seem possible. The most well known impossible object is the ship in a bottle. The goal is to discover how these objects are made. Another well known puzzle is one consisting of a cube made of two pieces interlocked in four places by seemingly inseparable links. The solutions to these are to be found in different places. There are all kinds of objects which fit this description – &quot;impossible bottles&quot; which contain objects that are far too large, Japanese hole coins with wooden arrows and rings through them, wooden spheres in a wooden frame with far too small openings and many more.

The apple and arrow in the picture are made of one piece of wood each. The hole is in effect too small to fit the arrow through it and there are no signs of gluing.

=== Dexterity ===
The games listed in this category are not strictly puzzles as such, as dexterity and endurance are of more importance here. Often, the aim is to incline a box fitted with a transparent cover in just the right way as to cause one or more small balls to fall into holes.

=== Sequential movement ===


The puzzles in this category require a repeated manipulation of the puzzle to get the puzzle to a certain target condition. Well-known puzzles of this sort are the Rubik&#x27;s Cube and the Tower of Hanoi.
This category also includes those puzzles in which one or more pieces have to be slid into the right position, of which the N-puzzle is the best known. Rush Hour or Sokoban are other examples.

The Rubik&#x27;s Cube caused an unprecedented boom of this category. A large number of variants have been produced. Cubes of dimensions from 2×2×2 to 33×33×33 have been made, as well as many other geometric shapes such as tetrahedral and dodecahedral. With a varying orientation of the axis of rotation a variety of puzzles with the same basic shape can be created. Furthermore, one can obtain further cuboidal puzzles by removing one layer from a cube. These cuboidal puzzles take irregular shapes when they are manipulated.

The picture shows another, less well-known example of this kind of puzzle. It is just easy enough that it can still be solved with a bit of trial and error, and a few notes, as opposed to Rubik&#x27;s Cube which is too difficult to just solve by trial.

===Simulated mechanical===
While many computer games and computer puzzles simulate mechanical puzzles, these simulated mechanical puzzles are usually not strictly classified as mechanical puzzles.

<text>Disentanglement puzzles (also called entanglement puzzles, tanglement puzzles, tavern puzzles or topological puzzles) are a type or group of mechanical puzzle that involves disentangling one piece or set of pieces from another piece or set of pieces. Several subtypes are included under this category, the names of which are sometimes used synonymously for the group: wire puzzles; nail puzzles; ring-and-string puzzles; &quot;et al&quot;. Although the initial object is disentanglement, the reverse problem of reassembling the puzzle can be as hard as—or even harder than—disentanglement. There are several different kinds of disentanglement puzzles, though a single puzzle may incorporate several of these features.

==Wire-and-string puzzles==
Wire-and-string puzzles usually consist of: 
* one piece of string, ribbon or similar, which may form a closed loop or which may have other pieces like balls fixed to its end.
* one or several pieces of stiff wire
* sometimes additional pieces like wooden ball through which the string is threaded.

One can distinguish three subgroups of wire-and-string puzzles:
* Closed string subgroup: The pieces of string consist of one closed loop, as in the &quot;Baguenaudier&quot; puzzle. Usually the string has to be disentangled from the wire.
* Unclosed loose string subgroup: The pieces of string are not closed, and are not attached to the wire. In this case the ends of the string are fitted with a ball, cube or similar which stops the string from slipping out too easily. Usually the string has to be disentangled from the wire. Sometimes other tasks have to be completed instead, such as shifting a ring or ball from one end of the string to another end.
* Unclosed fixed string subgroup: The pieces of string are not closed, but are somewhere on its length attached to the wire. In these puzzles the string is not to be disentangled from the wire. One possible task may be to shift a ring or ball from one end of the string to another end.

One particularly difficult puzzle was designed by R. Boomhower in 1966 and has been modified into different designs (but topologically similar). Different versions include a paddle-shaped design, a vertical beam on a wood support, and two vertical beams on a wood support. Variations also have the string passing through the slot once or two times. Names have included the Boomhower puzzle, T-Bar puzzle, Wit&#x27;s End puzzle, and the Mini Rope Bridge puzzle. Some sources identify a topologically-equivalent puzzle called the Mystery Key issued by the Peter Pan company in the 1950s.

==Wire puzzles==

Wire puzzles, or nail puzzles consist of two or more entangled pieces of more or less stiff wire, metal rods, or bent nails. 
The pieces may or may not be closed loops. The closed pieces might be simple rings or have more complex shapes. Normally the puzzle must be solved by disentangling the two pieces without bending or cutting the wires.

Early wire puzzles were made from bent carpenter&#x27;s nails, horseshoes, or similar material.

==Plate-and-ring puzzles==

A plate-and-ring puzzle usually consists of three pieces:

* one plate or similar displaying many holes and/or indentations 
* a closed or nearly closed ring or a similar item.

The plate as well as the ring are usually made from metal. The ring has to be disentangled from the plate.

==Puzzles with no solution==
Some puzzles have been created which may appear deceptively simple, but are actually impossible to solve. One such puzzle is the &quot;Notorious Figure Eight Puzzle&quot; (also called the &quot;Figure Eight Puzzle, or &quot;Possibly Impossible&quot;). It is sometimes sold with instructions giving hints as to its level of difficulty, and a &quot;solution&quot; is provided but is vague and impossible to follow, but the puzzle is actually impossible to solve.

==Mathematical modeling==
Most puzzle solvers try to solve such puzzles by mechanical manipulation, but some branches of mathematics can be used to create a model of disentanglement puzzles. Applying a configuration space with a topological framework is an analytical method to gain insight into the properties and solution of some disentanglement puzzles. However, some mathematicians have stated that capturing the important aspects of many such puzzles can often be difficult, and there is no universal algorithm that will provide the solution generally to such puzzles.

<text>A mongoose is a small terrestrial carnivorous mammal belonging to the family Herpestidae. This family has two subfamilies, the Herpestinae and the Mungotinae. The Herpestinae comprises 23 living species that are native to southern Europe, Africa and Asia, whereas the Mungotinae comprises 11 species native to Africa.
The Herpestidae originated about in the Early Miocene and genetically diverged into two main lineages between 19.1 and .

==Etymology==
The name is derived from names used in India for &quot;Herpestes&quot; species: 
 or in classical Hindi;
 in Marathi;
 in Telugu;
, and in Kannada.

The form of the English name (since 1698) was altered to its &quot;-goose&quot; ending by folk etymology. It was spelled &quot;mungoose&quot; in the 18th and 19th centuries. 

The plural form is &quot;mongooses&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Mongooses have long faces and bodies, small, rounded ears, short legs, and long, tapering tails. Most are brindled or grizzly; a few have strongly marked coats which bear a striking resemblance to mustelids. Their nonretractile claws are used primarily for digging. Mongooses, much like goats, have narrow, ovular pupils. Most species have a large anal scent gland, used for territorial marking and signaling reproductive status and a short and smooth penis with a baculum and an elongated urethral opening on its underside. The dental formula of mongooses is .
They range from in head-to-body length, excluding the tail. In weight, they range from to .

Mongooses are one of at least four known mammalian taxa with mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that protect against snake venom. Their modified receptors prevent the snake venom α-neurotoxin from binding. These represent four separate, independent mutations. In the mongoose, this change is effected, uniquely, by glycosylation.

==Taxonomy==
Herpestina was a scientific name proposed by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1845 who considered the mongooses a subfamily of the Viverridae. In 1864, John Edward Gray classified the mongooses into three subfamilies: Galidiinae, Herpestinae and Mungotinae. This grouping was supported by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1919, who referred to the family as &quot;Mungotidae&quot;.

Genetic research based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA analyses revealed that the Galidiinae are more closely related to Madagascar carnivores, including the fossa and Malagasy civet. Galidiinae is considered a subfamily of Eupleridae.

===Phylogenetic relationships===
Phylogenetic research of 18 mongoose species revealed that the solitary and social mongooses form different clades. 
The phylogenetic relationships of Herpestidae are shown in the following cladogram:
=== Extinct species ===
&quot;Atilax&quot; 

* †&quot;A. mesotes&quot; 

&quot;Herpestes&quot; 

* †&quot;H. lemanensis&quot; 

&quot;Leptoplesictis&quot; 

* †&quot;L. atavus&quot; 
* †&quot;L. aurelianensis&quot; 
* †&quot;L. filholi&quot; 
* †&quot;L. mbitensis&quot; 
* †&quot;L. namibiensis&quot; 
* †&quot;L. peignei&quot;, 
* †&quot;L. rangwai&quot; 
* †&quot;L. senutae&quot; 

==Behaviour and ecology==
Mongooses mostly feed on insects, crabs, earthworms, lizards, birds, and rodents. However, they also eat eggs and carrion.

Some species can learn simple tricks. They can be tamed and are kept as pets to control vermin.

==Cultural significance==
In ancient Mesopotamia, mongooses were sacred to the deity Ninkilim, who was conflated with Ningirama, a deity of magic who was invoked for protection against serpents. According to a Babylonian popular saying, when a mouse fled from a mongoose into a serpent&#x27;s hole, it announced, &quot;I bring you greetings from the snake-charmer!&quot; A creature resembling a mongoose also appears in Old Babylonian glyptic art, but its significance is not known.

All mongoose species, except for &quot;Suricata suricatta&quot;, are classed as a &quot;prohibited new organism&quot; under New Zealand&#x27;s Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996, preventing them from being imported into the country.

A well-known fictional mongoose is Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, who appears in a short story of the same title in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1894) by Rudyard Kipling. In this tale set in India, a young pet mongoose saves his human family from a krait and from Nag and Nagaina, two cobras. The story was later made into several films and a song by Donovan, among other references. A mongoose is also featured in Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lair of the White Worm&quot;. The main character, Adam Salton, purchases one to independently hunt snakes. Another mongoose features in the denouement of the Sherlock Holmes story &quot;The Adventure of the Crooked Man&quot;, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The Indian Tamil devotional film &quot;Padai Veetu Amman&quot; shows Tamil actor Vinu Chakravarthy changing himself into a mongoose by using his evil tantric mantra, to fight the goddess Amman. However, the mongoose finally dies at the hands of the goddess.

Mongoose species are prohibited to be kept as pets in the United States.

<doc id="211762" wikidata="Q3921032" url="?curid=211762" title="Burr puzzle">
<text>A burr puzzle is an interlocking puzzle consisting of notched sticks, combined to make one three-dimensional, usually symmetrical unit.
These puzzles are traditionally made of wood, but versions made of plastic or metal can also be found. Quality burr puzzles are usually precision-made for easy sliding and accurate fitting of the pieces.
In recent years the definition of &quot;burr&quot; is expanding, as puzzle designers use this name for puzzles not necessarily of stick-based pieces.

==History==

The term &quot;burr&quot; is first mentioned in a 1928 book by Edwin Wyatt, but the text implies that it was commonly used before. The term is attributed to the finished shape of many of these puzzles, resembling a seed burr.
The origin of burr puzzles is unknown. The first known record appears in a 1698 engraving used as a frontispiece page of Chambers&#x27;s Cyclopaedia. Later records can be found in German catalogs from the late 18th century and early 19th century. In China, they are called Lu Ban Locks (鲁班锁) and are attributed to the inventor Lu Ban. In Kerala, India, these wooden puzzles are called &quot;edakoodam(ഏടാകൂടം)&quot;.

==Six-piece burr==

The six-piece burr, also called &quot;Puzzle Knot&quot; or &quot;Chinese Cross&quot;, is the most well-known and presumably the oldest of the burr puzzles. This is actually a family of puzzles, all sharing the same finished shape and basic shape of the pieces. The earliest US patent for a puzzle of this kind dates back to 1917.

For many years, the six-piece burr was very common and popular, but was considered trite and uninteresting by enthusiasts. Most of the puzzles made and sold were very similar to one another and most of them included a &quot;key&quot; piece, an unnotched stick that slides easily out. In the late 1970s, however, the six-piece burr regained the attention of inventors and collectors, thanks largely to a computer analysis conducted by the mathematically trained puzzle designer Bill Cutler which was published by Martin Gardner in his Mathematical Games column in Scientific American.

===Structure===
All six pieces of the puzzle are square sticks of equal length (at least 3 times their width). When solved, the pieces are arranged in three perpendicular, mutually intersecting pairs. The notches of all sticks are located within the region of intersection, so when the puzzle is assembled they are unseen. All notches can be described as being made by removing cubic units (with an edge length of half the sticks&#x27; width), as shown in the figure:

There are 12 removable cubic units, and different puzzles of this family are made of sticks with different units removed. 4,096 permutations exist for removing the cubic units. Of those, we ignore the ones that cut the stick in two and the ones creating identical pieces, and are left with 837 usable pieces. Theoretically, these pieces can be combined to create over 35 billion possible assemblies, but it is estimated that fewer than six billion of them are actual puzzles, capable of being assembled or taken apart.

===Solid burr===
A burr puzzle with no internal voids when assembled is called a solid burr. These burrs can be taken apart directly by removing a piece or some pieces in one move. Up until the late 1970s, solid burrs received the most attention and publications referred only to this type. 119,979 solid burrs are possible, using 369 of the usable pieces. To assemble all these puzzles, one would need a set of 485 pieces, as some of the puzzles include identical pieces.

===Pieces types===
For aesthetic, but mostly practical reasons, the burr pieces can be divided into three types:
* Notchable pieces - with full notches running perpendicular to the long axis that can be made with a saw
* Millable pieces - with no internal blind corners that can be made with a milling machine.
* Non-notchable pieces - with internal corners that have to be made with a chisel or by gluing parts together.

59 of the usable pieces are notchable, including the unnotched stick. Of those, only 25 can be used to create solid burrs. This set, often referred to as &quot;The 25 notchable pieces&quot;, with the addition of 17 duplicates, can be assembled to create 221 different solid burr puzzles. Some of those puzzles have more than one solution, for a total of 314 solutions. These pieces are very popular, and full sets are manufactured and sold by many companies.

===Holey burr===
For all solid burrs, one movement is required to remove the first piece or pieces. However, a holey burr, which has internal voids when assembled, can require more than one move. The number of moves required for removing the first piece is referred to as the &quot;level&quot; of the burr. All solid burrs are therefore level 1. The higher the level is, the more difficult the puzzle.

During the 1970s and 1980s, attempts were made by experts to find burrs of an ever-higher level. On 1979, the American designer and craftsman Stewart Coffin found a level-3 puzzle. In 1985, Bill Cutler found a level-5 burr and shortly afterwards a level-7 burr was found by the Israeli Philippe Dubois. In 1990, Cutler completed the final part of his analysis and found that the highest possible level using notchable pieces is 5, and 139 of those puzzles exist. The highest level possible for a six-piece burr with more than one solution is 12, meaning 12 moves are required to remove the first piece.

==Three-piece burr==

A three-piece burr made from sticks with &quot;regular&quot; right-angled notches (as the six-piece burr), cannot be assembled or taken apart. There are, however, some three-piece burrs with different kinds of notches, the best known of them being the one mentioned by Wyatt in his 1928 book, consisting of a rounded piece that is meant to be rotated.

==Known families==

===Altekruse===
The Altekruse puzzle is named after the grantee of its 1890 patent, though the puzzle is of earlier origin. The name &quot;Altekruse&quot; is of Austrian-German origin and means &quot;old-cross&quot; in German, which led to the presumption that it was a pseudonym, but a man by that name immigrated to America in 1844 with his three brothers to avoid being drafted to the Prussian Army and is presumed to be the one who filed this patent.

A classic Altekruse consists of 12 identical pieces. In order to disassemble it, two halves of the puzzle have to be moved in opposite directions. Using two more of these pieces, the puzzle can be assembled in a different way. By the same principle, other puzzles of this family can be created, with 6, 24, 36 and so forth. Despite their size, those bigger puzzles are not considered very difficult, yet they require patience and dexterity to assemble.

===Chuck===
The Chuck puzzle was invented and patented by Edward Nelson in 1897. His design was improved and developed by Ron Cook of the British company Pentangle Puzzles who designed other puzzles of the family.
The Chuck consists mostly of U-shaped stick pieces of various lengths, and some with an extra notch that are used as key pieces. For creating bigger Chuck puzzles (named Papa-chuck, Grandpapachuck and Great Grandpapachuck, by Cook) one would need to add longer pieces. The Chuck can also be regarded as an extension of a six-piece burr of very simple pieces called Baby-chuck, which is very easy to solve. Chuck pieces of different lengths can also be used to create asymmetric shapes, assembled according to the same principle as the original puzzle.

===Pagoda===
The origin of the Pagoda, also called &quot;Japanese Crystal&quot; is unknown. It is mentioned in Wyatt&#x27;s 1928 book. Puzzles of this family can be regarded as an extension of the &quot;three-piece burr&quot; (Pagoda of size 1), however they do not require special notches to be assembled or taken apart. Pagoda of size 2 consists of 9 pieces, and bigger versions consist of 19, 33, 51 and so forth. Pagoda of size formula_1 consists of formula_2 pieces.

==Diagonal burr==

Though most burr puzzle pieces are made with square notches, some are made with diagonal notches. Diagonal burr pieces are square sticks with V-shaped notches, cut at an angle of 45° off the stick&#x27;s face. These puzzles are often called &quot;stars&quot;, as it is customary to also cut the sticks&#x27; edges at an angle of 45°, for aesthetic reasons, giving the assembled puzzle a star-like shape.

<text>Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (), or Saxe-Coburg-Gotha ( ), was an Ernestine duchy in Thuringia ruled by a branch of the House of Wettin, consisting of territories in the present-day states of Thuringia and Bavaria in Germany. It lasted from 1826 to 1918. In November 1918, Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, was forced to abdicate. In 1920, the northern part of the duchy (since 1918 the Free State of Gotha; culturally and linguistically Thuringian) was merged with six other Thuringian free states to form the Free State of Thuringia: Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (until 1918 a grand duchy), Saxe-Altenburg and Saxe-Meiningen (until 1918 duchies), Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and Schwarzburg-Sondershausen (until 1918 principalities), as well as the People&#x27;s State of Reuss (until 1918 the principalities of Reuss-Gera and Reuss-Greiz). The southern part of the duchy (since 1918 the Free State of Coburg; culturally and linguistically Franconian), as southernmost of the Thuringian states, was the only one which, after a referendum, became part of the Free State of Bavaria.

The name &quot;Saxe-Coburg-Gotha&quot; also refers to the family of the ruling House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, which played many varied roles in the dynastic and political history of Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries. In the early part of the 20th century, before the First World War, it was the family of the sovereigns of the United Kingdom, Belgium, Portugal, Bulgaria, and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. In 1910, the Portuguese king was deposed, and the same thing occurred in Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in 1918 and in Bulgaria in 1946 (although effective control had already ceased two years prior due to a coup). , a branch of the family still reigns in Belgium, and while the British line still technically exists up to the present day, it now uses the name Windsor due to a proclamation issued by King George V in 1917. The former Tsar of Bulgaria, Simeon II (reigned 1943–46), kept his surname while serving as the Prime Minister of Bulgaria from 2001 to 2005.

==History==

The Duchy was born when the arbitration of the King of Saxony, Frederick Augustus, produced the Treaty of Hildburghausen on 12 November 1826 for the &quot;Gothaische Teilung&quot; (Gothan Division), the extensive rearrangement of the Ernestine duchies. After the extinction of the Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg line, the Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen exchanged his Duchy for that of Saxe-Altenburg. The Saxe-Meiningen line became Saxe-Hildburghausen and got from Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld the Saalfelder territories as well as the District of Themar and the places of Mupperg, Mogger, Liebau and Oerlsdorf. The Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld received for that the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg, Districts of Königsberg and Sonnefeld from Saxe-Hildburghausen, and the properties of Callenberg and Gauerstadt from Saxe-Meiningen.

By then, the Principality of Lichtenberg, on the Nahe River, had already been a part of the Duchy of Coburg for ten years. Ernest III, the sovereign of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, had received it in 1816 from the Congress of Vienna for providing assistance to the Allies in their war against France. But, because of the great distance from Coburg and of the unrest caused by the Hambach Festival, the Duke sold the Principality in 1834 to Prussia.

The newly created Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was initially a double duchy, ruled by Ernest III as Duke Ernest I in a personal union, but with only one vote in the &quot;Bundesrat&quot;. The opportunity to unify the two duchies in 1826 was missed. After the &quot;Staatsgrundgesetz&quot; (House laws) of 1852, the duchies were bound in a political and real union. They were then a quasi-federal unitary state. Later attempts to merge the duchies failed in 1867 because the &quot;Landtag&quot; of Gotha did not want to assume the higher state debts of Coburg and in 1872 because of the questions about the administration of the whole union.

The Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha received on 3 May 1852 a national constitution, which had taken substantial parts of the fundamental rights from the Constitution of the National Assembly in Frankfurt. It also joined the German Zollverein in 1834, the North German Confederation in 1866 and the German Empire in 1871. At the &quot;Bundesrat&quot; in Berlin, where it had a seat, it kept its agents but, since 1913, like most of the other Thuringian states, it had to defer to the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen for the representation.

Ernest I died in 1844. His elder son and successor, Ernest II, ruled until his own death in 1893. Because he had died childless, the throne of the two duchies would have passed to his late brother Prince Albert&#x27;s male descendants. But Prince Albert was the husband of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and his eldest son, Edward, the Prince of Wales, was already her heir apparent. Besides, he was prohibited by the Constitutions of both duchies from inheriting the throne if there were other eligible male heirs. But he had already renounced his claim in favour of his next brother, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. So Alfred became the next Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.


Alfred&#x27;s only son, also named Alfred, died in 1899, so when Duke Alfred died in 1900 he was succeeded by his nephew the Duke of Albany, the 16-year-old son of Queen Victoria&#x27;s youngest son, Leopold, as Duke Alfred&#x27;s next brother Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and his son Prince Arthur of Connaught had renounced their own claims to the succession. Reigning as Duke Carl Eduard, Charles Edward, because of his age, began under the Regency of Prince Ernst von Hohenlohe-Langenburg until he came of age in 1905. The new Duke also continued to use his British title, the Duke of Albany. But, because he chose to side with the Germans against the British in the First World War, he was stripped of his British titles in 1919.

After the November Revolution ended the monarchy in 1918, the two duchies became two different and independent states, the Free State of Coburg, and the Republic of Gotha, later renamed the Free State of Gotha. Their leaders believed, however, that their new countries were not economically viable, so they began to search for possible mergers. Eventually, a referendum was held on 30 November 1919 and the decision was made. On 1 May 1920, the Free State of Gotha merged with the new State of Thuringia, and the Free State of Coburg followed two months later, on 1 July 1920, by uniting with the Free State of Bavaria.

==Politics==
In the German Empire, the Duchy had only one vote in the &quot;Bundesrat&quot; and two votes (for the two Duchies of Coburg and Gotha) in the &quot;Reichstag&quot;.

Each Duchy had its own &quot;Landtag&quot;, elected every four years by male taxpayers over 25 years of age. Only males 30 years or older were eligible to stand for the elections. The Coburger assembly had 11 members and its twin in Gotha had 19. The assemblies met every year but, every two years, they would combine, alternatively in Gotha and Coburg, for the matters and questions that involve both Duchies.

For both duchies, however, there was a Ministry of State in Gotha but Coburg and Gotha had their own subordinate and almost independent ministries. The Minister of State directed Gotha&#x27;s Ducal ministry but, for both Duchies, he was responsible for the state affairs, the economical and commercials policies, the judiciary and the conduct of Imperial laws. In Coburg, for state matters as such as community services, police duties, support of the state church, and education, as well as management of assets and finances, and also, until 1891, court matters, the local authorities could not interfere with the decisions from Gotha.

The finances of both Duchies remained basically disconnected. But, in their management, a distinction was always made between the Crown revenue from the domains and the State revenue from taxes and duties. Every four years, a common budget, especially in the financial dealings with the German Empire, was made, even if it interfered with the local and national operations of the two Duchies. Grants from the state budgets of both Duchies were made in the ratio of 7 to 3 between Gotha and Coburg.

Because of its size and finances, the Duchy did not have ambassadors but it did have trade consuls. They were for trade with Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Ecuador, France, Great Britain, Italy, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Prussia, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, and Turkey. The United States had its own consul in Coburg from 1897 to 1918.

During the American Civil War, Ernst Raven was assigned to the position of consul in the state of Texas. He applied to the Confederate Government for a diplomatic exequatur on 30 July 1861 and was accepted.

==Military==

Before 1867, the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha had its own Army. But, on 26 June 1867, because of a treaty signed in 1866 with Prussia, its Army was added, for defending and recruiting purposes, to the 6th Thuringian Infantry Regiment No. 95 of the 22nd Division of the XIth Army Corps. Three battalions of the 6th Thuringian were assigned to Gotha (No. 1), Hildburghausen (No. 2) and Coburg (No. 3) but the Corps headquarters was in Kassel. Unlike Prussia, where military service was mandatory, Saxe-Coburg and Gotha filled its quota in the Imperial Army with the draft.

==Miscellaneous==
The capitals of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha were Coburg and Gotha. By 1914 the area and populations of the two duchies were:

There are two residences in Gotha and Coburg. Therefore, the whole ducal court, including the Court Theater, had to move twice a year: from Gotha to Coburg for the summer, from Coburg to Gotha for the winter. For the Court Theater, two almost identical buildings had to be built in 1840 in Gotha (destroyed in the Second World War) and Coburg (now the Coburg State Theater) and thereafter maintained at the same time. In addition to the residential castles, &quot;Friedenstein&quot; in Gotha and &quot;Ehrenburg&quot; in Coburg, the Ducal family also used the &quot;Schloss&quot; Reinhardsbrunn in Gotha as well as the Rosenau and Callenberg castles in Coburg and the hunting lodge Greinburg Castle, Grein, Austria (the latter two still today owned by the ducal branch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha).
Only the Duchy of Gotha, along with nearby Duchies of Saxe-Meiningen and Saxe-Altenburg and especially the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach – was able to be one of the sponsoring states of the University of Jena. Coburg did not have its own university. It did not have its court of law, either. Gotha had its own court of law while Coburg had to go to Meiningen for the legal administration.

===Titles and styles of the Sovereign of the House===
According to the &quot;Staatsgrundgesetz&quot; (House laws) of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the full title of the Duke was:

&quot;Wir, Ernst, Herzog zu Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha, Jülich, Cleve und Berg, auch Engern und Westphalen, Landgraf in Thüringen, Markgraf zu Meißen, gefürsteter Graf zu Henneberg, Graf zu der Mark und Ravensberg, Herr zu Ravenstein und Tonna usw.&quot;

Translation: We, Ernest, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Jülich, Cleves and Berg, also Angria and Westphalia, Landgrave in Thuringia, Margrave of Meissen, Princely Count of Henneberg, Count of the Mark and Ravensberg, Lord of Ravenstein and Tonna, et cetera.

===Titles and styles of other members of the House===
The use of Ducal and Princely titles may be restricted if the marriage conflicts with the requirements of the &quot;Staatsgrundgesetz&quot; or if a member of the House renounces his claims for himself and his descendants.

<text>Operation Anadyr () was the code name used by the Soviet Union for its Cold War secret operation in 1962 of deploying ballistic missiles, medium-range bombers, and a division of mechanized infantry to Cuba to create an army group that would be able to prevent an invasion of the island by United States forces. The plan was to deploy approximately 60,000 personnel in support of the main missile force, which consisted of three R-12 missile regiments and two R-14 missile regiments. However, part of it was foiled when the United States discovered the plan, prompting the Cuban Missile Crisis.

== Motivations ==

According to the memoirs of Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet leader at the time, he and his defense minister, Rodion Malinovsky, were walking on a Black Sea beach in April 1962 and discussing the threat posed by the short flight time of US Jupiter missiles deployed in Turkey, which needed about 10 minutes to land in the Soviet Union. The disparity in number of warheads between the Soviet Union and the West was also being discussed when deploying missiles to Cuba took root in Khrushchev&#x27;s mind as a way to compensate for these disadvantages. As Khrushchev put it, he saw the deployment of Soviet missiles in Cuba as &quot;putting one of our hedgehogs down the Americans&#x27; trousers&quot;.

== Initial plan ==
The initial deployment plan for Operation Anadyr was drafted by General Anatoly Gribkov and two of his assistants sometime after a meeting of the Soviet Defense Council on May 21, 1962, at which Khrushchev&#x27;s basic idea was discussed and approved. Gribkov&#x27;s plan included a main missile force of five regiments (including an R-12 regiment from 50th Rocket Army). Three would be armed with R-12 medium-range missiles and two armed with R-14 intermediate-range missiles; each regiment would also be equipped with eight launchers and 1.5 missiles per launcher. In support of this main force, the plan called for:
* two regiments of FKR-1 cruise missiles equipped with 16 launchers and 80 tactical nuclear warheads
* two antiaircraft divisions
* a fighter regiment equipped with MiG-21s
* four motorized rifle regiments, each with its own tank battalion
* a brigade of 12 missile boats

The total personnel figure for the operation was 50,874. The forces required an estimated 85 transports to deploy: mostly freighters, but also some passenger liners. Malinovsky approved this deployment plan on July 4, and Khrushchev gave his final approval three days later.

The fighter regiment (40 MiG-21 aircraft) deployed was the 32nd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment, from the Kubinka air base. It was renamed the 213th Fighter Aviation Regiment during the deployment.

On September 4, some of the surface-to-air antiaircraft missiles and missile boats (which deployed ahead of the main missile force) were spotted by US reconnaissance flights, and President John F. Kennedy issued a warning. In response, Khrushchev approved reinforcements:

* six Il-28 bombers with a total of six 407H nuclear bombs at their disposal
* three Luna battalions equipped with a total of twelve type 3N14 nuclear warheads
Since the main missile force had not yet been dispatched, these reinforcements would be shipped along with it.

== Transport and deployment ==

Troops were transferred by 86 blockade runners, which conducted 180 voyages from ports at Baltiysk, Liepāja, Sevastopol, Feodosiya, Nikolayev, Poti, Murmansk, and Kronstadt.

Oleg Penkovsky, a double agent in the Soviets&#x27; GRU intelligence service primarily working for Britain&#x27;s MI6, provided details of the missile placements to the United States. A former GRU colonel who defected, Viktor Suvorov, wrote, &quot;Historians will remember with gratitude the name of the GRU Colonel Oleg Penkovsky. Thanks to his priceless information, the Cuban crisis was not transformed into a last World War.&quot;

A Lockheed KH-5 Argon reconnaissance satellite was launched on October 9 from Vandenberg Air Force Base. On October 14, photographs were taken by a Lockheed U-2. On October 16, President Kennedy and the United States military command were informed of the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba, and the Cuban Missile Crisis started. 

==Soviet denial and deception==
Operation Anadyr was not only a missile and troop deployment, but also a complex denial and deception campaign. The Soviet attempt to position nuclear weapons in Cuba occurred under a shroud of great secrecy, both to deny the United States information on the deployment of the missiles and to deceive the United States&#x27; political leadership, military, and intelligence services on the Soviets&#x27; intentions in Cuba. The parameters of Anadyr demanded that both medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles be deployed to Cuba and operable before their existence was discovered by the United States, and the Soviet General Staff and political leadership turned to radical measures to achieve this.

===Military deception===
Perhaps the most fundamental deception in Operation Anadyr was the code name itself. To an American intelligence analyst poring over intercepted Soviet military communications, &quot;Anadyr&quot; would suggest anything but a movement of Soviet troops to the Caribbean. The Anadyr is a river that flows into the Bering Sea, and also the name of a Soviet district capital and a remote bomber base, both in the far east of the Soviet Union. Thus, both American analysts and rank-and-file Soviet soldiers, prone to starting rumors and leaking information, would most likely have expected the operation to be a military exercise in the northern vastness of the USSR.

In the early planning stages of Operation Anadyr, only five senior officers on the General Staff were privy to the details of the deployment or its actual location. They alone prepared every feature of the enterprise, enough work to keep scores of staff busy for weeks, but so stringent was the demand for secrecy that no one else was allowed into this small coterie. The plans were handwritten to deny knowledge of the operation to even a single secretary.

The logistical preparations for Anadyr were equally covert. Men and matériel were moved by railway to four northern ports and four on the Black Sea. Foreigners were barred from the ports during this period, and most loading occurred under the cover of darkness. Troops awaiting the voyage were restricted to barracks and denied contact with the outside world. The same restrictions were placed on the sailors of the transport ships. During the wait, Soviet soldiers kept busy by constructing false superstructures with plywood to hide the ships&#x27; defenses, and even on-deck field kitchens. Metal sheets were placed over missiles and missile launchers, which were too large to be stored below decks on most vessels, to prevent detection by infrared surveillance. Other military equipment was stored below decks. Agricultural equipment and other non-military machinery was placed on deck to add to the subterfuge. Once underway, the Soviet troops were not allowed on deck, except at night, and even then only in small groups.

Instructions to the troops and ship crews were carried by special couriers to prevent Western intelligence services from intercepting electronic communications regarding the operation. The ships&#x27; captains received their instructions, which revealed their final destination, only after they had put out to sea. The instructions were given to them by a KGB officer aboard who had been entrusted with the envelope prior to departure. Every vessel carried thick folders of information on various countries for the officers aboard to review. Only after the destination was revealed were they specifically instructed to study Cuba.

Soviet denial and deception measures were equally rigid upon the ships&#x27; arrival in Cuba. The vessels unloaded at eleven ports to complicate adversarial surveillance. While non-military equipment was unloaded in daylight, matériel with obvious military qualities was unloaded and transported to its end destination only at night. The same applied to major troop movements, and Soviet military positions were generally in sparsely populated areas of the island. The Soviet troops were even forbidden to wear their uniforms, in order to make the Soviet military presence deniable. Instead, they wore civilian attire. Simultaneously, as a false explanation for the presence of the men and equipment, the Soviet media trumpeted the massive agricultural assistance that the Soviets were ostensibly providing to their Cuban comrades.

===Diplomatic deception===
The Soviets employed an equally extensive array of diplomatic ruses to disguise their activities in Cuba. Khrushchev embarked on a tour of the Soviet republics in Central Asia for much of the duration of Anadyr. During this time, he explicitly avoided all hostile references to the United States.

The Soviet ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Dobrynin, was a primary instrument in transmitting diplomatic assurances that only defensive weaponry was being supplied to Cuba. On September 4, 1962, for instance, Dobrynin personally asked Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to inform President Kennedy that no ballistic missiles or other offensive armaments had been transported to Cuba. Dobrynin was repeating a message from Khrushchev himself. Later, he would again deny the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba.

A KGB officer posted at the Soviet embassy, Georgi Bolshakov, was another source of disinformation. Bolshakov met regularly with Robert Kennedy, who believed him to be an honest diplomat and a discreet communications channel to Khrushchev. Robert Kennedy seemed to personally trust Bolshakov, and President Kennedy came to rely on his information. Throughout the duration of Operation Anadyr, Bolshakov assured the Kennedy brothers that Moscow had no aspirations of turning Cuba into a forward strike base. Bolshakov lost their trust only when the president was shown photographs, taken by a Lockheed U-2 surveillance aircraft, of Soviet ballistic missiles on Cuban soil.

The Soviet media also disseminated misinformation to the public and the world&#x27;s political leaders. On September 11, the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union claimed that the USSR was supplying exclusively defensive weaponry to Cuba to deter American aggression, and that it had no need to place offensive weapons outside of its own soil. &quot;Pravda&quot;, the official newspaper of the Soviet Communist Party, even censored elements of a speech made by Cuba&#x27;s leader, Fidel Castro, that hinted at the Soviets&#x27; ability to strike the United States from Cuba.

Kennedy was not the only president whom the Soviets attempted to deceive. They also fed false information to the Communist Party of Cuba, overstating the American threat to Cuba, to persuade Cuban leaders to allow Soviet nuclear weapons to be deployed to the island.

Some non-Soviets, however, were privy to accurate information regarding both the American threat and Soviet intentions. The KGB waged a deception campaign in support of Anadyr that involved feeding partially or even wholly correct information to the Cuban émigré community in Miami, Florida. The Soviets knew that information from Cuban exile organizations was perceived by the American intelligence services as highly unreliable. They assumed, correctly, that the Americans would discount warnings from the community as lies that the Cuban émigrés hoped would prompt an American invasion of Cuba and an overthrow of the Castro regime. This assessment was bitterly remembered by the Cuban exile community in the United States. Cuban expatriates, particularly the Truth About Cuba Committee, later condemned the Kennedy administration for its failure to perceive Soviet activities in Cuba despite accurate reports.

The Soviet denial and deception campaign was highly effective, but the eventual discovery of the missile emplacements, which occurred after they were operational, was almost inevitable. American imagery analysis of the Soviet vessels sailing for Cuba had proven fruitless; no indication that the ships carried anything other than non-military equipment was visible. Some American analysts speculated that some of the larger ships might be carrying nuclear-capable ballistic missiles in their holds, but no definitive evidence existed until those missiles were already on Cuban soil. Finally, on October 14, an American U-2 reconnaissance aircraft photographed Soviet ballistic missiles in Cuba. President Kennedy received the images two days later. On October 23, six Vought F-8 Crusader reconnaissance aircraft gathered clearer images from a lower altitude that provided definitive proof of the deployment of Soviet nuclear weapons. The following morning, President Kennedy authorized the blockade that began the actual crisis.

==Operation &quot;Kama&quot;==

One part of Operation Anadyr was Operation &quot;Kama&quot;, a plan to station seven Soviet ballistic missile submarines in Mariel, Cuba, much like the United States stations ballistic missile submarines in Holy Loch, Scotland. The operation began on October 1, 1962, with the departure of four diesel-electric attack submarines to the Caribbean Sea to clear the way. All four submarines were Project 641 boats, known to NATO as the Foxtrot class. The boats were the B-4 (known as &quot;Chelyabinski Komsomolets&quot;), the B-36, the B-59, and the B-130.

&quot;Kama&quot; failed independently of Anadyr, with none of the initially deployed attack submarines reaching Cuba. All four of the attack submarines were detected by the blockade of Cuba in the Sargasso Sea and followed closely by American destroyers and ASW aircraft. (Some of the destroyer crews harassed the Soviet submarines by dropping hand grenades overboard, making it clear that depth charges could follow at any time. One submarine had its rudder damaged and had to be towed back to the USSR.) The after-action report prepared by the Soviet Union&#x27;s Northern Fleet Headquarters attributed the detection and pursuit of B-36 to the destroyer Charles P. Cecil, and the detection and pursuit of B-59 to a multitude of destroyers and carrier-launched planes. Three of the four submarines were forced to the surface by U.S. Navy ships. B-4 was detected by anti-submarine aircraft, but, unlike the other submarines, it had freshly recharged accumulator batteries. Because of this, it was able to remain submerged until it had evaded the pursuing destroyers.

All of the Soviet submarines experienced a wide range of equipment failures, with faulty cooling systems and damage to the ships themselves. Anatoly Petrovich Andreyev&#x27;s diary entries describe constant dehydration and sweating in temperatures ranging from 37 °C to 57 °C, and infected rashes—due to lack of water for hygiene—were reported in 100% of personnel. The onboard freezers were overwhelmed, compromising much of the submarines&#x27; food supply. Some of them partially surfaced in an attempt to alleviate these problems, which increased the likelihood of detection. Operation &quot;Kama&quot; ended ignominiously, with three submarines forced to surface within visual range of American ships and the fourth unable to do anything beyond avoid capture.

<text>The North American Aviation XB-70 Valkyrie is a retired prototype version of the planned  nuclear-armed, deep-penetration supersonic strategic bomber for the United States Air Force Strategic Air Command. Designed in the late 1950s by North American Aviation (NAA) to replace the B-52 Stratofortress and B-58 Hustler, the six-engine, delta-winged Valkyrie could cruise for thousands of miles at Mach 3+ while flying at .

At these speeds, it was expected that the B-70 would be practically immune to interceptor aircraft, the only effective weapon against bomber aircraft at the time. The bomber would spend only a brief time over a particular radar station, flying out of its range before the controllers could position their fighters in a suitable location for an interception. Its high speed made the aircraft difficult to see on radar displays and its high-altitude and high-speed capabilities could not be matched by any contemporaneous Soviet interceptor or fighter aircraft.

The introduction of the first Soviet surface-to-air missiles in the late 1950s put the near-invulnerability of the B-70 in doubt. In response, the US Air Force (USAF) began flying its missions at low level, where the missile radar&#x27;s line of sight was limited by terrain. In this low-level penetration role, the B-70 offered little additional performance over the B-52 it was meant to replace, while being far more expensive with shorter range. Alternative missions were proposed, but these were of limited scope. With the advent of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) during the late 1950s, crewed nuclear bombers were increasingly seen as obsolete.

The USAF eventually gave up fighting for its production and the B-70 program was cancelled in 1961. Development was then turned over to a research program to study the effects of long-duration high-speed flight. As a result, two prototype aircraft, designated XB-70A, were built; these aircraft were used for supersonic test-flights from 1964 to 1969. In 1966, one prototype crashed after colliding with an F-104 Starfighter while flying in close formation; the remaining Valkyrie bomber is in the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton, Ohio.

==Development==

===Background===
In an offshoot of Boeing&#x27;s MX-2145 crewed boost-glide bomber project, Boeing hired RAND Corporation in January 1954 to explore what sort of bomber aircraft would be needed to deliver the various nuclear weapons under development. At the time, nuclear weapons weighed several tons, and the need to carry enough fuel to fly that payload from the continental United States to the Soviet Union demanded large bombers. Boeing and RAND also concluded that the aircraft would need supersonic speed to escape the blast of its bombs.

The aviation industry had been studying this problem for some time. From the mid-1940s, there was interest in using nuclear-powered aircraft as bombers. In a conventional jet engine, thrust is provided by heating air using jet fuel and accelerating it out a nozzle. In a nuclear engine, heat is supplied by a reactor, whose consumables last for months instead of hours. Most designs also carried a small amount of jet fuel for high-power portions of flight, such as takeoffs and high-speed dashes.

Another possibility being explored at the time was the use of boron-enriched &quot;zip fuels&quot;, which increase the energy density of jet fuel by about 40 percent, and could be used in modified versions of existing jet engine designs. Zip fuels appeared to offer sufficient performance improvement to produce a strategic bomber with supersonic speed.

===WS-110A===
The Air Force followed these developments closely, and in 1955 issued General Operational Requirement No. 38 for a new bomber, combining the payload and intercontinental range of the B-52 with the Mach 2 top speed of the Convair B-58 Hustler. The new bomber was expected to enter service in 1963. Nuclear and conventional designs were considered. The nuclear-powered bomber was organized as &quot;Weapon System 125A&quot; and pursued simultaneously with the jet-powered version, &quot;Weapon System 110A&quot;.
The USAF Air Research and Development Command&#x27;s (ARDC) requirement for WS-110A asked for a chemical-fuel bomber with Mach 0.9 cruising speed and &quot;maximum possible&quot; speed during a entrance and exit from the target. The requirement also called for a payload and a combat radius of . The Air Force formed similar requirements for a WS-110L intercontinental reconnaissance system in 1955, but this was later canceled in 1958 due to better options. In July 1955, six contractors were selected to bid on WS-110A studies. Boeing and North American Aviation submitted proposals, and on 8 November 1955 were awarded contracts for Phase 1 development.

In mid-1956, initial designs were presented by the two companies. Zip fuel was to be used in the afterburners to improve range by 10 to 15 percent over conventional fuel. Both designs had huge wing-tip fuel tanks that could be jettisoned when their fuel was depleted before a supersonic dash to the target. The tanks also included the outer portions of the wing, which would also be jettisoned to produce a smaller wing suitable for supersonic speeds. Both became trapezoidal wings after ejection, at that time the highest performance planform known. They also featured flush cockpits to maintain the highest fineness ratio possible in spite of its effects on visibility.

The two designs had takeoff weights of about with large fuel loads. The Air Force evaluated the designs, and in September 1956 deemed them too large and complicated for operations. General Curtis LeMay was dismissive, declaiming, &quot;This is not an airplane, it&#x27;s a three-ship formation.&quot; The USAF ended Phase 1 development in October 1956 and instructed the two contractors to continue design studies.

===New designs===
While the original proposals were being studied, advances in supersonic flight were proceeding rapidly. The narrow delta was establishing itself as a preferred planform for supersonic flight, replacing earlier designs like the swept-wing and trapezoidal layouts seen on designs like the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and the earlier WS-110 concepts. Engines able to cope with higher temperatures were also under development, allowing for sustained supersonic speeds.

This work led to an interesting discovery: when an engine was optimized specifically for high speed, it burned perhaps twice as much fuel at that speed than when it was running at subsonic speeds. However, the aircraft would be flying as much as four times as fast. Thus its most economical cruise speed, in terms of fuel per mile, was its maximum speed. This was entirely unexpected and implied that there was no point in the dash concept; if the aircraft was able to reach Mach 3, it may as well fly its entire mission at that speed. The question remained whether such a concept was technically feasible, but by March 1957, engine development and wind tunnel testing had progressed enough to suggest that it was.

WS-110 was redesigned to fly at Mach 3 for the entire mission. Zip fuel was retained for the engine&#x27;s afterburner to increase range. Both North American and Boeing returned new designs with very long fuselages and large delta wings. They differed primarily in engine layout; the NAA design arranged its six engines in a semi-circular duct under the rear fuselage, while the Boeing design used separate podded engines located individually on pylons below the wing, like the Hustler.
North American scoured available literature to find any additional advantage. This led them to an obscure report by two NACA wind tunnel experts, who wrote a report in 1956 titled &quot;Aircraft Configurations Developing High Lift-Drag Ratios at High Supersonic Speeds&quot;. Known today as compression lift, the idea was to use the shock wave generated off the nose or other sharp points on the aircraft as a source of high-pressure air. By carefully positioning the wing in relation to the shock, the shock&#x27;s high pressure could be captured on the bottom of the wing and generate additional lift. To take maximum advantage of this effect, they redesigned the underside of the aircraft to feature a large triangular intake area far forward of the engines, better positioning the shock in relation to the wing. The six individually-podded engines were repositioned, three in each of two separate ducts, under the fuselage.

North American improved on the basic concept by adding a set of drooping wing-tip panels that were lowered at high speed. This helped trap the shock wave under the wing between the downturned wing tips. It also added more vertical surface to the aircraft to maintain directional stability at high speeds. NAA&#x27;s solution had an additional advantage, as it decreased the surface area of the rear of the wing when the panels were moved into their high-speed position. This helped offset the natural rearward shift of the center of pressure, or &quot;average lift point&quot;, with increasing speeds. Under normal conditions this caused an increasing nose-down trim, which had to be offset by moving the control surfaces, increasing drag. When the wing tips were drooped, the lifting area of the wings was lessened, moving the lift forward and reducing trim drag.

The buildup of heat due to skin friction during sustained supersonic flight had to be addressed. During a Mach 3 cruise, the aircraft would reach an average of , with leading edges reaching , and up to in engine compartments. NAA proposed building their design out of sandwich panels, with each panel consisting of two thin sheets of stainless steel brazed to opposite faces of a honeycomb-shaped foil core. Expensive titanium would be used only in high-temperature areas like the leading edge of the horizontal stabilizer, and the nose. To cool the interior, the XB-70 pumped fuel en route to the engines through heat exchangers.

On 30 August 1957, the Air Force decided that enough data were available on the NAA and Boeing designs that a competition could begin. On 18 September, the Air Force issued operational requirements that called for a cruising speed of Mach 3.0 to 3.2, an over-target altitude of , a range of up to , and a gross weight not to exceed . The aircraft would have to use the hangars, runways and handling procedures used by the B-52. On 23 December 1957, the North American proposal was declared the winner of the competition, and on 24 January 1958, a contract was issued for Phase 1 development.

In February 1958, the proposed bomber was designated &quot;B-70&quot;, with the prototypes receiving the &quot;X&quot; experimental prototype designation. The name &quot;Valkyrie&quot; was the winning submission in early 1958, selected from 20,000 entries in a USAF &quot;Name the B-70&quot; contest. The Air Force approved an 18-month program acceleration in March 1958 that rescheduled the first flight to December 1961. But in late 1958 the service announced that this acceleration would not be possible due to lack of funding. In December 1958, a Phase II contract was issued. The mockup of the B-70 was reviewed by the Air Force in March 1959. Provisions for air-to-surface missiles and external fuel tanks were requested afterward. At the same time, North American was developing the F-108 supersonic interceptor. To reduce program costs, the F-108 would share two of the engines, the escape capsule, and some smaller systems with the B-70. In early 1960, North American and the USAF released the first drawing of the XB-70 to the public.

===The &quot;missile problem&quot;===
The B-70 was planned to use a high-speed, high-altitude bombing approach that followed a trend of bombers flying progressively faster and higher since the start of crewed bomber use. Through that same period, only two weapons proved effective against bombers: fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA). Flying higher and faster made it more difficult for both; higher speeds allowed the bomber to fly out of range of the weapons more quickly, while higher altitudes increased the time needed for fighters to climb to the bombers, and greatly increased the size of the AAA weapons needed to reach those altitudes.

As early as 1942, German flak commanders had already concluded that AAA would be essentially useless against jet aircraft, and began development of guided missiles to fill this role. Most forces reached the same conclusion soon afterwards, with both the US and UK starting missile development programs before the war ended. The UK&#x27;s Green Mace was one of the last attempts to develop a useful high-altitude AAA weapon, but its development ended in 1957.

Interceptor aircraft with ever-improving performance remained the only effective anti-bomber weapons by the early 1950s, and even these were having problems keeping up with the latest designs; Soviet interceptors during the late 1950s could not intercept the high-altitude U-2 reconnaissance aircraft, despite its relatively low speeds. It was later discovered that flying faster also made radar detection much more difficult due to an effect known as the blip-to-scan ratio, and any reduction in tracking efficiency would further interfere with the operation and guidance of fighters.

The introduction of the first effective anti-aircraft missiles by the late 1950s changed this picture dramatically. Missiles could stand ready for immediate launch, eliminating operational delays like the time needed to get the pilot into the cockpit of a fighter. Guidance did not require wide-area tracking or calculation of an intercept course: a simple comparison of the time needed to fly to the altitude of the target returned the required deflection. Missiles also had greater altitude capability than any aircraft and improving this to adapt to new aircraft was a low-cost development path. The US was aware of Soviet work in the field, and had reduced the expected operational lifetime of the U-2, knowing that it would become vulnerable to these missiles as they were improved. In 1960, a U-2 flown by Gary Powers was shot down by one of the earliest Soviet guided air-defence missiles, the S-75 Dvina, known in the west as the SA-2 Guideline.

Faced with this problem, military doctrine had already started shifting away from high-altitude supersonic bombing toward low-altitude &quot;penetration&quot;. Radar is line-of-sight, so aircraft could dramatically shorten detection distances by flying close to the Earth and hiding behind terrain. Missile sites spaced to overlap in range when attacking bombers at high altitudes would leave large gaps between their coverage for bombers flying at lower levels. With an appropriate map of the missile sites, the bombers could fly between and around the defenses. Additionally, early missiles generally flew unguided for a period of time before the radar systems were able to track the missile and start sending it guidance signals. With the SA-2 missile, this minimum altitude was roughly .

Flying at low level provided protection against fighters as well. Radars of the era did not have the ability to look down (see look-down/shoot-down); if a higher altitude aircraft&#x27;s radar was aimed down to detect targets at a lower altitude, the reflection of the ground would overwhelm the signal returned from a target. An interceptor flying at normal altitudes would be effectively blind to bombers far below it. The interceptor could descend to lower altitudes to increase the amount of visible sky, but doing so would limit its radar range in the same way as the missile sites, as well as greatly increasing fuel use and thus reducing mission time. The Soviet Union would not introduce an interceptor with look-down capability until 1972 with the High Lark radar in the MiG-23M, and even this model had very limited capability.

Strategic Air Command found itself in an uncomfortable position; bombers had been tuned for efficiency at high speeds and altitudes, performance that had been purchased at great cost in both engineering and financial terms. Before the B-70 was to replace the B-52 in the long-range role, SAC had introduced the B-58 Hustler to replace the Boeing B-47 Stratojet in the medium-range role. The Hustler was expensive to develop and purchase, and required enormous amounts of fuel and maintenance in comparison to the B-47. It was estimated that it cost three times as much to operate as the much larger and longer-ranged B-52.

The B-70, designed for even higher speeds, altitudes and range than the B-58, suffered even more in relative terms. At high altitudes, the B-70 was as much as four times as fast as the B-52, but at low altitudes it was limited to only Mach 0.95, only modestly faster than the B-52 at the same altitudes. It also had a smaller bomb load and shorter range. Its only major advantage would be its ability to use high speed in areas without missile cover, especially on the long journey from the US to USSR. The value was limited; the USAF&#x27;s doctrine stressed that the primary reason for maintaining the bomber force in an era of ICBMs was that the bombers could remain in the air at long ranges from their bases and were thus immune to sneak attack. In this case, the higher speed would be used for only a short period of time between the staging areas and the Soviet coastline.

Adding to the problems, the zip fuel program was canceled in 1959. After burning, the fuel turned into caustic and abrasive liquids and solids that increased wear on moving turbine engine components and were toxic, making servicing difficult. Although the B-70 was intended to use zip only in the afterburners, and thus avoid this problem, the enormous cost of the zip program for such limited gains led to its cancellation. This by itself was not a fatal problem as newly developed high-energy fuels like JP-6 were available to make up some of the difference. Most of the range lost in the change from zip fuel was restored by filling one of the two bomb bays with a fuel tank. Another problem arose when the XF-108 program was canceled in September 1959, which ended the shared development that benefited the B-70 program.

===Downsizing, upswing, cancellation===
At two secret meetings on 16 and 18 November 1959, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General Nathan Twining, recommended the Air Force&#x27;s plan for the B-70 to reconnoiter and strike rail-mobile Soviet ICBMs, but the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Thomas White, admitted the Soviets would &quot;be able to hit the B-70 with rockets&quot; and requested the B-70 be downgraded to &quot;a bare minimum research and development program&quot; at $200 million for fiscal year 1960 (equivalent to $ billion today). President Eisenhower responded that the reconnaissance and strike mission was &quot;crazy&quot; since the nuclear mission was to attack known production and military complexes, and emphasized that he saw no need for the B-70 since the ICBM is &quot;a cheaper, more effective way of doing the same thing&quot;. Eisenhower also identified that the B-70 would not be in manufacturing until &quot;eight to ten years from now&quot; and &quot;said he thought we were talking about bows and arrows at a time of gunpowder when we spoke of bombers in the missile age&quot;. In December 1959 the Air Force announced the B-70 project would be cut to a single prototype, and most of the planned B-70 subsystems would no longer be developed.

Then interest increased due to the politics of presidential campaign of 1960. A central plank of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s campaign was that Eisenhower and the Republicans were weak on defense, and pointed to the B-70 as an example. He told a San Diego audience near NAA facilities, &quot;I endorse wholeheartedly the B-70 manned aircraft.&quot; Kennedy also made similar campaign claims regarding other aircraft: near the Seattle Boeing plant he affirmed the need for B-52s and in Fort Worth he praised the B-58.
The Air Force changed the program to full weapon development and awarded a contract for an XB-70 prototype and 11 YB-70s in August 1960. In November 1960, the B-70 program received a $265 million (equivalent to $ billion today) appropriation from Congress for FY 1961. Nixon, trailing in his home state of California, also publicly endorsed the B-70, and on 30 October Eisenhower helped the Republican campaign with a pledge of an additional $155 million ($ billion today) for the B-70 development program.

On taking office in January 1961, Kennedy was informed that the missile gap was an illusion. On 28 March 1961, after $800 million (equivalent to $ billion today) had been spent on the B-70 program, Kennedy canceled the project as &quot;unnecessary and economically unjustifiable&quot; because it &quot;stood little chance of penetrating enemy defenses successfully.&quot; Instead, Kennedy recommended &quot;the B-70 program be carried forward essentially to explore the problem of flying at three times the speed of sound with an airframe potentially useful as a bomber.&quot; After Congress approved $290 million ($ billion today) of B-70 &quot;add-on&quot; funds to the President&#x27;s 12 May 1960 modified FY 1961 budget, the Administration decided on a &quot;Planned Usage&quot; of only $100 million ($ million today) of these funds. The Department of Defense subsequently presented data to Congress that the B-70 would add little performance for the high cost.

After becoming the new Air Force Chief of Staff in July 1961, Curtis LeMay increased his B-70 advocacy, including interviews for August &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; and November &quot;Aviation Week&quot; articles, and allowing a 25 February General Electric tour at which the press was provided artist conceptions of, and other info about, the B-70. Congress had also continued B-70 appropriations to resurrect bomber development. After Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara explained again to the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) on 24 January 1962 that the B-70 was unjustifiable, LeMay subsequently argued for the B-70 to both the House and Senate committees—and was chastised by McNamara on 1 March. By 7 March 1962, the HASC, 21 of whose members had B-70 work in their districts, had written an appropriations bill to &quot;direct&quot;—by law—the Executive Branch to use all of the nearly $500 million (equivalent to $ billion today) appropriated for the RS-70 (see Variants). McNamara was unsuccessful with an address to the HASC on 14 March, but a 19 March 1962 White House Rose Garden agreement between Kennedy and HASC chairman Carl Vinson retracted the bill&#x27;s language and the bomber remained canceled.

===Experimental aircraft===
The XB-70s were intended to be used for the advanced study of aerodynamics, propulsion, and other subjects related to large supersonic transports. The crew was reduced to only the two pilots, as a navigator and a bombardier were not needed for this research role. The production order was reduced to three prototypes in March 1961 with the third aircraft to incorporate improvements from the previous prototype. The order was later reduced to two experimental XB-70As, named Air Vehicle 1 and 2 (AV-1 and AV-2). XB-70 No. 1 was completed on 7May 1964, and rolled out on 11May 1964 at Palmdale, California. One report stated &quot;nothing like it existed anywhere&quot;. AV-2 was completed on 15 October 1964. The manufacture of the third prototype (AV-3) was canceled in July 1964 before completion. The first XB-70 carried out its maiden flight in September 1964 and many more test flights followed.

The data from the XB-70 test flights and aerospace materials development were used in the later B-1 bomber program, the American supersonic transport (SST) program, and via espionage, the Soviet Union&#x27;s Tupolev Tu-144 SST program. The development of the Lockheed U-2 and the SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft, as well as the XB-70, prompted Soviet aerospace engineers to design and develop their high-altitude and high-speed MiG-25 interceptor.

== Design ==
The Valkyrie was designed to be a high-altitude Mach 3 bomber with six engines. Harrison Storms shaped the aircraft with a canard surface and a delta wing, which was built largely of stainless steel, sandwiched honeycomb panels, and titanium. The XB-70 was designed to use supersonic technologies developed for the Mach 3 SM-64 Navaho, as well as a modified form of the Navaho&#x27;s inertial guidance system.

The XB-70 used compression lift, which resulted from a shock wave generated by the leading edge of the engine intake splitter below the apex of the wing. At Mach 3 cruising speed, the shock wave is bent back about 65 degrees and the wing is superimposed on the shock system which has a pressure higher under the aircraft than in front of the shock. The compression lift provided five percent of the total lift. Camber was added to the wing leading edge inboard of the folding tips to improve subsonic handling and reduce supersonic drag. The outer portions of the wings were hinged to pivot downward by 65 degrees, acting as a type of variable-geometry wingtip device. This increased the aircraft&#x27;s directional stability at supersonic speeds, shifted the center of pressure to a more favorable position at high speeds, and caused the shock originating at the intake splitter to reflect from the vertical tip surface giving additional compression lift.

Like a number of other delta-wing aircraft designed for supersonic speeds (Concorde, Tu-144, FD2), the Valkyrie needed a feature to improve the pilot&#x27;s view during nose-high low-speed flight and on the ground. An outer windshield and ramp, which could be lowered, was provided enabling viewing through the fixed cockpit windshield. With the ramp raised into its high-speed position, the forebody was more streamlined. Rain removal and windshield anti-ice was accomplished by utilizing bleed air from the engines. The lower forward section included a radar bay, and production machines were to be equipped with a refueling receptacle on the upper surface of the forward fuselage.

The XB-70 was equipped with six General Electric YJ93-GE-3 turbojet engines, which used JP-6 jet fuel, specially formulated for the mission requirements. The engine was stated to be in the &quot;30,000-pound class&quot;, but actually produced with afterburner and without afterburner. The Valkyrie used fuel for cooling; it was pumped through heat exchangers before reaching the engines. To reduce the likelihood of autoignition, nitrogen was injected into the JP-6 during refueling, and the &quot;fuel pressurization and inerting system&quot; vaporized a supply of liquid nitrogen to fill the fuel tank vent space and maintain tank pressure.

==Operational history==
The XB-70&#x27;s maiden flight was on 21 September 1964. In the first flight test, between Palmdale and Edwards AFB, one engine had to be shut down shortly after take-off, and an undercarriage malfunction warning meant that the flight was flown with the undercarriage down as a precaution, limiting speed to – about half that planned. During landing, the rear wheels of the port side main gear locked, the tires ruptured, and a fire started.

The Valkyrie first became supersonic (Mach 1.1) on the third test flight on 12 October 1964, and flew above Mach 1 for 40 minutes during the following flight on 24 October. The wing tips were also lowered partially in this flight. XB-70 No. 1 surpassed Mach 3 on 14 October 1965 by reaching Mach 3.02 at . The first aircraft was found to suffer from weaknesses in the honeycomb panels, primarily due to inexperience with fabrication and quality control of this new material. On two occasions, honeycomb panels failed and were torn off during supersonic flight, necessitating a Mach 2.5 limit being placed on the aircraft.

The deficiencies discovered on AV-1 were almost completely solved on the second XB-70, which first flew on 17 July 1965. On 3 January 1966, XB-70 No. 2 attained a speed of Mach 3.05 while flying at . AV-2 reached a top speed of Mach 3.08 and maintained it for 20 minutes on 12 April 1966. On 19 May 1966, AV-2 reached Mach 3.06 and flew at Mach 3 for 32 minutes, covering in 91 minutes of total flight.
A joint NASA/USAF research program was conducted from 3 November 1966 to 31 January 1967 for measuring the intensity and signature of sonic booms for the National Sonic Boom Program. Testing was planned to cover a range of sonic boom overpressures on the ground similar to but higher than those anticipated from the proposed American SST. In 1966, AV-2 was selected for the program and was outfitted with test sensors. It flew the first sonic boom test on 6 June 1966, attaining a speed of Mach 3.05 at . Two days later, AV-2 crashed following a mid-air collision with an F-104 while flying in a multi-aircraft formation. Sonic boom and later testing continued with XB-70A #1.

The second flight research program (NASA NAS4-1174) investigated &quot;control of structural dynamics&quot; from 25 April 1967 through the XB-70&#x27;s last flight in 1969. At high altitude and high speed, the XB-70A experienced unwanted changes in altitude. NASA testing from June 1968 included two small vanes on the nose of AV-1 for measuring the response of the aircraft&#x27;s stability augmentation system. AV-1 flew a total of 83 flights.

The XB-70&#x27;s last supersonic flight took place on 17 December 1968. On 4 February 1969, AV-1 took its final flight to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for museum display (now the National Museum of the United States Air Force). Flight data was collected on this subsonic trip. North American Rockwell completed a four-volume report on the B-70 that was published by NASA in April 1972.

==Incidents and accidents==

===Incidents===
On 7 May 1965, a piece of the apex of the wing broke off in flight and caused extensive damage to five of the six engines. They were sent to GE and repaired. The sixth engine was inspected and re-installed in the aircraft.

On 14 October 1965, AV-1 surpassed Mach 3, but heat and stress damaged the honeycomb panels, leaving of the leading edge of the left wing missing. The first aircraft was limited to Mach 2.5 afterwards.

===Mid-air collision===
On 8 June 1966, XB-70A No. 2 was in close formation with four other aircraft (an F-4 Phantom, an F-5, a T-38 Talon, and an F-104 Starfighter) for a photoshoot at the behest of General Electric, manufacturer of the engines of all five aircraft. A sixth aircraft, a Learjet 23, had been contracted by General Electric to photograph the formation.

After the photoshoot, the F-104 drifted into the XB-70&#x27;s right wingtip, flipped and rolled inverted over the top of the Valkyrie, before striking the bomber&#x27;s vertical stabilizers and left wing. The F-104 then exploded, destroying the Valkyrie&#x27;s vertical stabilizers and damaging its left wing. Despite the loss of both vertical stabilizers and damage to the wings, the Valkyrie flew straight for 16 seconds before it entered an uncontrollable spin and crashed north of Barstow, California. NASA Chief Test Pilot Joe Walker (F-104 pilot) and Carl Cross (XB-70 co-pilot) were killed. Al White (XB-70 pilot) ejected, sustaining serious injuries, including the crushing of his arm by the closing clamshell-like escape crew capsule moments prior to ejection.

The USAF summary report of the accident investigation stated that, given the position of the F-104 relative to the XB-70, Walker, the F-104 pilot, would not have been able to see the XB-70&#x27;s wing, except by uncomfortably looking back over his left shoulder. The report said that it was likely that Walker maintained his position by looking at the fuselage of the XB-70, forward of his position. The F-104 was estimated to be to the side of the fuselage of the XB-70 and below. The report concluded that from that position, without appropriate sight cues, Walker was unable to properly perceive his motion relative to the Valkyrie, leading to his aircraft drifting into the XB-70&#x27;s wing. The accident investigation also pointed to the wake vortex from the XB-70&#x27;s right wingtip as the reason for the F-104&#x27;s sudden roll over and into the bomber.

The General Electric photoshoot had not been authorized by the Air Force. After the catastrophe, Col. Albert W. Cate was dismissed from his position, and Col. Joe Cotton, Col. James G. Smith and John S. McCollom were reprimanded.

==Aircraft on display==
Valkyrie AV-1 (AF Ser. No. 62-0001) is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB near Dayton, Ohio. The aircraft was flown to the museum on 4 February 1969, following the conclusion of the XB-70 testing program. The Valkyrie became the museum&#x27;s signature aircraft, appearing on Museum letterhead, and even appearing as the chief design feature for the museum&#x27;s restaurant, the &quot;Valkyrie Cafe&quot;. In 2011, the XB-70 was on display in the museum&#x27;s Research &amp; Development Hangar alongside other experimental aircraft. After completion of the fourth hangar at the museum&#x27;s main campus, the XB-70 was moved there in late October 2015.

<text>A crypt (from Greek κρύπτη (kryptē) &quot;&quot; &quot;vault&quot;) is a stone chamber beneath the floor of a church or other building. It typically contains coffins, sarcophagi, or religious relics.

Originally, crypts were typically found below the main apse of a church, such as at the Abbey of Saint-Germain en Auxerre, but were later located beneath chancel, naves and transepts as well. Occasionally churches were raised high to accommodate a crypt at the ground level, such as St Michael&#x27;s Church in Hildesheim, Germany.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;crypt&quot; developed as an alternative form of the Latin &quot;vault&quot; as it was carried over into Late Latin, and came to refer to the ritual rooms found underneath church buildings. It also served as a vault for storing important and/or sacred items.

The word &quot;crypta&quot;, however, is also the female form of &quot;crypto&quot; &quot;hidden&quot;. The earliest known origin of both is in the Ancient Greek &quot;&quot;, the first person singular indicative of the verb &quot;to conceal, to hide&quot;.

==Development==

First known in the early Christian period, in particular North Africa at Chlef and Djemila in Algeria, and Byzantium at Saint John Studio in Constantinople where Christian churches have been built over mithraea, the mithraeum has often been adapted to serve as a crypt.

The famous crypt at Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, Rome, developed about the year 600, as a means of affording pilgrims a view of Saint Peter&#x27;s tomb, which lay according to the Roman fashion, directly below the high altar. The tomb was made accessible through an underground passageway beneath the sanctuary from where pilgrims could enter at one stair, pass by the tomb and exit without interrupting the clerical community&#x27;s service at the altar directly above.

The Visigothic crypt (the Crypt of San Antolín) in Palencia Cathedral (Spain), was built during the reign of Wamba to preserve the remains of the martyr Saint Antoninus of Pamiers, a Visigothic-Gallic nobleman brought from Narbonne to Visigothic Hispania in 672 or 673 by Wamba himself. These are the only remains of the Visigothic cathedral of Palencia.

Crypts were introduced into Frankish church building in the mid-8th century, as a feature of its Romanization. Their popularity then spread more widely in western Europe under Charlemagne. Examples from this period are most common in the early medieval West, for example in Burgundy at Dijon and Tournus.

After the 10th century, the early medieval requirements of a crypt faded, as church officials permitted relics to be held in the main level of the church. By the Gothic period crypts were rarely built, however burial vaults continued to be constructed beneath churches and referred to as crypts.

==Burial vaults==

In more modern terms, a crypt is most often a stone chambered burial vault used to store the deceased. Placing a corpse into a crypt can be called &quot;immurement&quot;, and is a method of final disposition, as an alternative to, for example, cremation. Crypts are usually found in cemeteries and under public religious buildings, such as churches or cathedrals, but are also occasionally found beneath mausolea or chapels on personal estates. Wealthy or prestigious families will often have a &#x27;family crypt&#x27; or &#x27;vault,&#x27; in which all members of the family are interred. Many royal families, for example, have vast crypts containing the bodies of dozens of former royalty. In some localities, an above ground crypt is more commonly called a mausoleum, which also refers to any elaborate building intended as a burial place, for any number of people.

There was a trend in the 19th century of building crypts on medium to large size family estates, usually subtly placed on the edge of the grounds or more commonly incorporated into the cellar. After a change of owner, these are often blocked up and the house deeds will not allow this area to be re-developed .

<text>A royal family is the immediate family of kings/queens, emirs/emiras, sultans/sultanas, or raja/rani and sometimes their extended family. 

The term imperial family appropriately describes the family of an emperor or empress, and the term papal family describes the family of a pope, while the terms baronial family, comital family, ducal family, archducal family, grand ducal family, or princely family are more appropriate to describe, respectively, the relatives of a reigning baron, count/earl, duke, archduke, grand duke, or prince. 

However, in common parlance members of any family which reigns by hereditary right are often referred to as royalty or &quot;royals&quot;. It is also customary in some circles to refer to the extended relations of a deposed monarch and their descendants as a royal family. A dynasty is sometimes referred to as the &quot;House of ...&quot;. In July 2013 there were 26 active sovereign dynasties in the world that ruled or reigned over 43 monarchies.

, while there are several European countries whose nominal head of state, by long tradition, is a king or queen, the associated royal families, with the notable exception of the British royal family, are non-notable ordinary citizens who may bear a title but are not involved in public affairs.

==Members of a royal family==
A royal family typically includes the spouse of the reigning monarch, surviving spouses of a deceased monarch, the children, grandchildren, brothers, sisters, and paternal cousins of the reigning monarch, as well as their spouses. In some cases, royal family membership may extend to great grandchildren and more distant descendants of a monarch. In certain monarchies where voluntary abdication is the norm, such as the Netherlands, a royal family may also include one or more former monarchs. In certain instances, such as in Canada, the royal family is defined by who holds the styles Majesty and Royal Highness. There is often a distinction between persons of the blood royal and those that marry into the royal family. Under most systems, only persons in the first category are dynasts, that is, potential successors to the throne (unless the member of the latter category is also in line to the throne in their own right, a frequent occurrence in royal families which frequently intermarry). This is not always observed; some monarchies have operated by the principle of &quot;jure uxoris&quot;.

In addition, certain relatives of the monarch (by blood or marriage) possess special privileges and are subject to certain statutes, conventions, or special common law. The precise functions of a royal family vary depending on whether the polity in question is an absolute monarchy, a constitutional monarchy, or somewhere in between. In certain monarchies, such as that found in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait, or in political systems where the monarch actually exercises executive power, such as in Jordan, it is not uncommon for the members of a royal family to hold important government posts or military commands. In most constitutional monarchies, however, members of a royal family perform certain public, social, or ceremonial functions, but refrain from any involvement in electoral politics or the actual governance of the country.

The specific composition of royal families varies from country to country, as do the titles and royal and noble styles held by members of the family. The composition of the royal family may be regulated by statute enacted by the legislature (e.g., Spain, the Netherlands, and Japan since 1947), the sovereign&#x27;s prerogative and common law tradition (e.g., the United Kingdom), or a private house law (e.g., Liechtenstein, the former ruling houses of Bavaria, Prussia, Hanover, etc.). Public statutes, constitutional provisions, or conventions may also regulate the marriages, names, and personal titles of royal family members. The members of a royal family may or may not have a surname or dynastic name (see Royal House).

In a constitutional monarchy, when the monarch dies, there is always a law or tradition of succession to the throne that either specifies a formula for identifying the precise order of succession among family members in line to the throne or specifies a process by which a family member is chosen to inherit the crown. Usually in the former case the exact line of hereditary succession among royal individuals may be identified at any given moment during prior reigns (e.g. United Kingdom, Sark, Nizari Ismailis, Japan, Balobedus, Sweden, Kingdom of Benin) whereas in the latter case the next sovereign may be selected (or changed) only during the reign or shortly after the demise of the immediately preceding monarch (e.g. Cambodia, KwaZulu Natal, Buganda, Saudi Arabia, Swaziland, Yorubaland, The Kingitanga). Some monarchies employ a mix of these selection processes (Malaysia, Monaco, Tonga, Jordan, Morocco), providing for both an identifiable line of succession as well as authority for the monarch, dynasty or other institution to alter the line in specific instances without changing the general law of succession. 

Some countries have abolished royalty altogether, as in post-revolutionary France (1870), post-revolutionary Russia (1917), Portugal (1910), post-war Germany (1918), post-war Italy (1946) and many ex European colonies.

<text>My Word! is a British radio quiz panel game broadcast by the BBC on the Home Service (1956–67) and Radio 4 (1967–88). It was created by Edward J. Mason and Tony Shryane, and featured the humorous writers Frank Muir and Denis Norden, known in Britain for the series &quot;Take It From Here&quot;. The show was piloted in June 1956 on the Midland Home Service and broadcast as a series on the national Home Service network from 1 January 1957. The series also ran on BBC Television for one series from July–September 1960.

For decades the programme was also broadcast worldwide via BBC World Service and was relayed to an international audience though the BBC Transcription Services. A companion programme, &quot;My Music&quot;, ran from 1967 to 1993.

==Background and first broadcasts==
In 1956, Edward J. Mason and Tony Shryane, respectively the writer and producer of the popular radio soap opera &quot;The Archers&quot;, decided that by way of a change they would devise and produce what Frank Muir called &quot;a new kind of not-very-academic literary quiz&quot;. The Aeolian Hall in London was booked for the recording of a pilot show, but at the last minute two of the four panellists were unexpectedly unavailable. Shryane sought the help of Muir and his writing partner Denis Norden, scriptwriters of the popular BBC comedy series &quot;Take It From Here&quot;, who were based in a nearby office. They thought of themselves as writers rather than performers, but at Shryane&#x27;s urgent request they agreed to stand in for the absentees. Muir was partnered by Isobel Barnett – a panel show regular – and Norden by the journalist Nancy Spain. Mason set the questions, and the chairman was the cricket commentator and poet John Arlott, who was billed as &quot;umpire&quot;. The pilot was well received by the audience in the hall and by listeners to its first transmission. The BBC commissioned a series, which was transmitted in early 1957. Muir and Norden had no intention of becoming regular panellists, but Shyrane persuaded them.

Arlott did not return for the second series, which began in August 1957. He was succeeded by Jack Longland, known to BBC listeners as the chairman of the panel show &quot;Country Questions&quot; and a regular team member on &quot;Round Britain Quiz&quot; and panellist on &quot;Any Questions?&quot; Although, unlike Arlott, Longland had no particular association with cricket he too was billed as umpire until 1962, after which he was billed as &quot;in the chair&quot;, as were his successors.

==Later series==
The programme ran for 38 series, until 1988. Muir and Norden were in every series, always on opposing teams. As Muir&#x27;s partner, Barnett was succeeded during the first series by the novelist and critic E. Arnot Robertson. On Robertson&#x27;s death in 1961 the film critic and Greek scholar Dilys Powell took her place until the show finished, when she was aged 87. Norden&#x27;s first partner was Nancy Spain; after her death in 1964 she was succeeded by the journalist Anne Scott-James, and then from 1979 by the historian Antonia Fraser. In the one season in which Fraser took the chair her place as Norden&#x27;s teammate was taken by Irene Thomas.

After 20 years in the chair, Longland retired from the programme at the end of the 1977 series. He was succeeded by John Julius Norwich for four series, followed by Fraser for a single series and finally Michael O&#x27;Donnell for the last five series, from late 1983 to 1988.

From time to time guests substituted for absent regulars. Neither Spain nor Powell ever missed a broadcast during their time as panellists, but Robertson and Scott-James missed one apiece, their absences covered respectively by Pamela Frankau and Katherine Whitehorn. Lionel Hale (one of the intended contestants in the pilot show) deputised for both Muir and Norden in 1967 as did John Wells in 1975 and Barry Took on four occasions between 1978 and 1982. Ted Kavanagh took Muir&#x27;s place for two programmes in 1957, and Edward Blishen stood in for Norden in two episodes in 1985. Fraser&#x27;s absences between 1986 and 1988 were covered by Joan Bakewell, Victoria Glendinning, P. D. James, Libby Purves and Gay Search.

After Mason&#x27;s death in 1971 Longland took over responsibility for compiling the questions, and was joined in that role by Peter Moore in 1972. After Longland&#x27;s retirement Moore continued to set the questions until 1987. For the final season, in 1988, O&#x27;Donnell combined the roles of chairman and question-setter.

== Content==
The two teams faced questions devised, for the first 21 series, by Mason, of whom Muir wrote:

Mason and his successors provided word games and literary quizzes covering vocabulary, etymology, snippets of poetry, and the like. In many series the opening round consisted of obscure words for the panellists to define: examples ranged from such words as auscultation, bumblepuppy, cabless and crinkum-crankum to defenestration, hebetude, hobbledehoy and katydid to lallation, macaronic, palmiped and rahat lokum, or scrimshaw, tatterdemalion, unau and widdershins.

In the final round, each team was asked to give the origin of a famous phrase or quotation. In early shows, once the real answers were given, Muir and Norden were invited to explain the origin of the phrase less seriously, in the form of a feghoot. An early example was the quotation &quot;Dead! And never called me mother!&quot; from a stage adaptation of &quot;East Lynne&quot;, which became the exclamation of a youth coming out of a public telephone box which he had discovered to be out of order. Later the first part of the round was dropped in favour of having the chairman simply announce the accepted origin of each phrase, thus opening up new fields of phrases that would have been too well known or too obscure to be posed as questions. In later series Muir and Norden chose their own phrases in advance of each programme, and their stories became longer and more convoluted.

The stories became a popular segment of the quiz. Examples included Norden&#x27;s tale in which a young woman and a young man found themselves happily trapped in a sauna despite earlier assurances from the landlord that the faulty lock had been repaired: &quot;Least said, soonest mended&quot; became &quot;Lease said sauna&#x27;s mended&quot;. In another, &quot;There&#x27;s many a slip &#x27;twixt the cup and the lip&quot; became a story about Édouard Manet in a drunken doze in a beauty spot between a carp pond and Lover&#x27;s Leap – &quot;There&#x27;s Manet asleep &#x27;twixt the carp and the leap&quot;. In another, Muir confessed to forging fan letters purportedly from Monica Dickens, Val Gielgud, Asa Briggs and Fay Compton, so that &quot;I am monarch of all I survey&quot; became &quot;I am Monica, Val, Asa, Fay&quot;. A Norden story explaining &quot;Charity shall cover the multitude of sins&quot; became a lament for his diminishing capacity for alcohol and consequent need to enunciate extremely carefully after drinking spirits: &quot;Clarity shall cover the multitude of gins&quot;.

==Series history==
A one-off pilot programme was broadcast by the Midland region of the BBC Home Service on 6 June 1956. When the series was launched on the national BBC network in January 1957, an edited edition of the pilot preceded the 14 new episodes.

==Syndication and spin-offs==
Over the years &quot;My Word!&quot; was syndicated through the BBC Transcription Services in more than 35 countries including not only Anglophone locations such as Australia and the US, but in countries including Chile, Germany and Russia. A televised version of the programme ran in Britain for a series of ten episodes on BBC Television from 10 July to 11 September 1960. The team and host were the same as for the radio series of that year; the producer was Barrie Edgar. A companion radio programme, &quot;My Music&quot;, ran from 1967 to 1993. When it was mooted, Muir and Norden told Shryane that they were too busy to take on another series, but they allowed themselves to be persuaded and became permanent features on the programme. In 1972 and 1973 the two shows joined forces to present Christmas specials, &quot;My Word! It&#x27;s My Music&quot;, with Longland and Steve Race as co-hosts and the regular &quot;My Word&quot; team joined by Ian Wallace and David Franklin (1972), and Wallace and John Amis (1973).

Between 1974 and 1989, Muir and Norden published five collections of their &quot;My Word!&quot; stories, and in 1991 an omnibus edition of the five volumes was issued:

<doc id="211791" wikidata="Q1151954" url="?curid=211791" title="Silkworm (missile)">
<text>The SY (), and HY () series were early anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM) developed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China from the Soviet P-15 Termit missile. They entered service in the late 1960s and remained the main ASCMs deployed by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy through the 1980s. The missiles were used by the PRC and export customers to develop land-attack missiles.

The name Silkworm is popularly used for the entire SY and HY family. As a NATO reporting name, it applies only to the land-based variant of the HY-1.

==Development==
Chinese preparations were underway before receiving the first P-15s and related technical data from the Soviets in 1959. On 8 October 1956, the Fifth Academy was founded - with Qian Xuesen as director - to pursue missile development. In March 1958 a cruise missile test site was selected at Liaoxi in Liaoning.

In November 1960, the first successful missile test was conducted after the withdrawal of Soviet advisors in September, due to the Sino-Soviet split. The P-15 was copied to become the SY-1. In October 1963, production started at the Nanchang Aircraft Manufacturing Company. In 1965, the first successful test occurred. In August 1967, production was approved. The SY-1 entered service by the end of the decade.

The SY-1 was developed into the improved HY-1. In December 1968, the HY-1 was successfully tested, and entered service in 1974.

==Operational history==

===Iran–Iraq War===
The Silkworm gained fame in the 1980s when it was used by both sides in the Iran–Iraq War. Both countries were supplied by China. In 1987, Iran launched a number of Silkworm missiles from the Faw Peninsula, striking the American-owned, Liberian-flagged tanker &quot;Sungari&quot; and the U.S.-flagged tanker &quot;Sea Isle City&quot; in October 1987. Five other missiles struck areas in Kuwait earlier in the year.

In October 1987, Kuwait&#x27;s Sea Island offshore oil terminal was hit by an Iranian Silkworm, which was observed to have originated from the Faw peninsula. The attack prompted Kuwait to deploy a Hawk missile battery on Failaka Island to protect the terminal. In December 1987, another Iranian Silkworm was fired at the terminal, but it struck a decoy barge instead. 

Prior to these attacks the missile&#x27;s range was thought to be less than , but these attacks proved that the range exceeded with Kuwaiti military observers seeing that the missiles originated from the area and tracking them on radar along with US satellite imagery of the launch sites.

===Persian Gulf War===
On February 25, 1991 during Operation Desert Storm, a shore-based Iraqi launcher fired two Silkworm missiles at the USS &quot;Missouri&quot; which was in company with the USS &quot;Jarrett&quot; and HMS &quot;Gloucester&quot;. A Sea Dart missile from HMS &quot;Gloucester&quot; shot down one Silkworm and the other missed, crashing into the ocean. Royal Air Force officers subsequently recovered an HY-2 missile at Umm Qasr in southern Iraq. It is currently displayed at the RAF Museum Cosford.

===Iraq War===
During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Iraq used the Silkworm (HY-2 Seersucker) as a surface to surface missile, by firing at least two of them at the coalition positions in Kuwait.

=== Blockade of Yemen ===
On 12 October 2016, during the Blockade of Yemen, two Silkworm missiles were fired from the Houthi-controlled port of Al Hudaydah at the destroyer operating in the Bab el-Mandeb strait. Both impacted the sea, possibly due to the countermeasures.

==Variants==
===SY series===
;SY-1
:License produced version of the P-15 Termit. NATO reporting name CSS-N-1 Scrubbrush.
;SY-2
:NATO reporting names CSS-N-5 Sabot. The SY-2 is a significant redesign of the SY-1 missile and is no longer a copy of the P-15. The missile has a longer airframe and is powered by a solid propellant rocket motor, instead of the liquid propellant design from the Styx. The SY-2 otherwise shares launchers and support equipment with the SY-1 (P-15), however, and eventually replaced the old missiles on unmodernized Jianghu class frigates.
;SY-2A
:An improved SY-2 with a longer range.
;FL-2
:The export version of the SY-2.

===HY series===
;HY-1
:NATO reporting names CSS-N-2 Safflower (ship-based) and CSSC-2 Silkworm (land-based.)
;HY-2
:NATO reporting names CSS-N-3 Seersucker (ship-based) and CSSC-3 Seersucker (land-based.)
;HY-3
:Unsuccessful supersonic variant.
;HY-4
:Powered by a WP-11 turbojet, a reverse-engineered Teledyne-Ryan J69-T-41A. Used for LACM development. NATO reporting name Sadsack.
;HY-41
:An improved HY-4.
;C-201
:An export version of the HY-2.
;C-301
:An export version of the HY-3.
;C-201W
:An export version of the HY-4.
;XM-41
:An export version of the HY-41.

===Further development===
;YJ-6
:Anti-ship missile developed from the HY-2.
;YJ-63
:Air-launched LACM sharing visual characteristics of the HY-2, HY-4, and YJ-6. 200 km range.
;AG-1
:Longer-ranged variant of the HY-2 developed by North Korea.

<doc id="211794" wikidata="Q746550" url="?curid=211794" title="Tangent bundle">
<text>A tangent bundle is the collection of all of the tangent spaces for all points on a manifold, structured in a way that it forms a new manifold itself. Formally, in differential geometry, the tangent bundle of a differentiable manifold formula_1 is a manifold formula_2 which assembles all the tangent vectors in formula_1. As a set, it is given by the disjoint union of the tangent spaces of formula_1. That is,

:formula_5

where formula_6 denotes the tangent space to formula_1 at the point formula_8. So, an element of formula_9 can be thought of as a pair formula_10, where formula_8 is a point in formula_1 and formula_13 is a tangent vector to formula_1 at formula_8.

There is a natural projection
:formula_16

defined by formula_17. This projection maps each element of the tangent space formula_18 to the single point formula_8.

The tangent bundle comes equipped with a natural topology (described in a section below). With this topology, the tangent bundle to a manifold is the prototypical example of a vector bundle (which is a fiber bundle whose fibers are vector spaces). A section of formula_9 is a vector field on formula_21, and the dual bundle to formula_9 is the cotangent bundle, which is the disjoint union of the cotangent spaces of formula_1. By definition, a manifold formula_1 is parallelizable if and only if the tangent bundle is trivial. By definition, a manifold formula_25 is framed if and only if the tangent bundle formula_2 is stably trivial, meaning that for some trivial bundle formula_27 the Whitney sum formula_28 is trivial. For example, the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional sphere &quot;Sn&quot; is framed for all &quot;n&quot;, but parallelizable only for (by results of Bott-Milnor and Kervaire).

==Role==
One of the main roles of the tangent bundle is to provide a domain and range for the derivative of a smooth function. Namely, if formula_29 is a smooth function, with formula_1 and formula_31 smooth manifolds, its derivative is a smooth function formula_32.

==Topology and smooth structure==
The tangent bundle comes equipped with a natural topology (&quot;not&quot; the disjoint union topology) and smooth structure so as to make it into a manifold in its own right. The dimension of formula_9 is twice the dimension of formula_21.

Each tangent space of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifold is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vector space. If formula_35 is an open contractible subset of formula_25, then there is a diffeomorphism formula_37 which restricts to a linear isomorphism from each tangent space formula_38 to formula_39. As a manifold, however, formula_9 is not always diffeomorphic to the product manifold formula_41. When it is of the form formula_42, then the tangent bundle is said to be &quot;trivial&quot;. Trivial tangent bundles usually occur for manifolds equipped with a &#x27;compatible group structure&#x27;; for instance, in the case where the manifold is a Lie group. The tangent bundle of the unit circle is trivial because it is a Lie group (under multiplication and its natural differential structure). It is not true however that all spaces with trivial tangent bundles are Lie groups; manifolds which have a trivial tangent bundle are called parallelizable. Just as manifolds are locally modeled on Euclidean space, tangent bundles are locally modeled on formula_43, where formula_35 is an open subset of Euclidean space.

If &quot;M&quot; is a smooth &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifold, then it comes equipped with an atlas of charts formula_45, where formula_46 is an open set in formula_25 and
:formula_48

is a diffeomorphism. These local coordinates on formula_49 give rise to an isomorphism formula_50 for all formula_51. We may then define a map

:formula_52

by
:formula_53

We use these maps to define the topology and smooth structure on formula_2. A subset formula_55 of formula_9 is open if and only if

:formula_57

is open in formula_58 for each formula_59 These maps are homeomorphisms between open subsets of formula_2 and formula_58 and therefore serve as charts for the smooth structure on formula_2. The transition functions on chart overlaps formula_63 are induced by the Jacobian matrices of the associated coordinate transformation and are therefore smooth maps between open subsets of formula_58.

The tangent bundle is an example of a more general construction called a vector bundle (which is itself a specific kind of fiber bundle). Explicitly, the tangent bundle to an formula_65-dimensional manifold formula_25 may be defined as a rank formula_65 vector bundle over formula_25 whose transition functions are given by the Jacobian of the associated coordinate transformations.

==Examples==
The simplest example is that of formula_69. In this case the tangent bundle is trivial: each formula_70 is canonically isomorphic to formula_71 via the map formula_72 which subtracts formula_8, giving a diffeomorphism formula_74.

Another simple example is the unit circle, formula_75 (see picture above). The tangent bundle of the circle is also trivial and isomorphic to formula_76. Geometrically, this is a cylinder of infinite height.

The only tangent bundles that can be readily visualized are those of the real line formula_77 and the unit circle formula_78, both of which are trivial. For 2-dimensional manifolds the tangent bundle is 4-dimensional and hence difficult to visualize.

A simple example of a nontrivial tangent bundle is that of the unit sphere formula_79: this tangent bundle is nontrivial as a consequence of the hairy ball theorem. Therefore, the sphere is not parallelizable.

==Vector fields==
A smooth assignment of a tangent vector to each point of a manifold is called a vector field. Specifically, a vector field on a manifold formula_1 is a smooth map
:formula_81

such that formula_82 with formula_83 for every formula_84. In the language of fiber bundles, such a map is called a &quot;section&quot;. A vector field on formula_25 is therefore a section of the tangent bundle of formula_25.

The set of all vector fields on formula_25 is denoted by formula_88. Vector fields can be added together pointwise

:formula_89
and multiplied by smooth functions on &quot;M&quot;

:formula_90

to get other vector fields. The set of all vector fields formula_88 then takes on the structure of a module over the commutative algebra of smooth functions on &quot;M&quot;, denoted formula_92.

A local vector field on formula_25 is a &quot;local section&quot; of the tangent bundle. That is, a local vector field is defined only on some open set formula_94 and assigns to each point of formula_35 a vector in the associated tangent space. The set of local vector fields on formula_25 forms a structure known as a sheaf of real vector spaces on formula_25.

The above construction applies equally well to the cotangent bundle – the differential 1-forms on formula_25 are precisely the sections of the cotangent bundle formula_99, formula_100 that associate to each point formula_101 a 1-covector formula_102, which map tangent vectors to real numbers: formula_103. Equivalently, a differential 1-form formula_99 maps a smooth vector field formula_105 to a smooth function formula_106.

==Higher-order tangent bundles==
Since the tangent bundle formula_2 is itself a smooth manifold, the second-order tangent bundle can be defined via repeated application of the tangent bundle construction:

:formula_108

In general, the formula_109th order tangent bundle formula_110 can be defined recursively as formula_111.

A smooth map formula_112 has an induced derivative, for which the tangent bundle is the appropriate domain and range formula_113. Similarly, higher-order tangent bundles provide the domain and range for higher-order derivatives formula_114.

A distinct but related construction are the jet bundles on a manifold, which are bundles consisting of jets.

==Canonical vector field on tangent bundle==
On every tangent bundle formula_2, considered as a manifold itself, one can define a canonical vector field formula_116 as the diagonal map on the tangent space at each point. This is possible because the tangent space of a vector space &quot;W&quot; is naturally a product, formula_117 since the vector space itself is flat, and thus has a natural diagonal map formula_118 given by formula_119 under this product structure. Applying this product structure to the tangent space at each point and globalizing yields the canonical vector field. Informally, although the manifold formula_25 is curved, each tangent space at a point formula_121, formula_122, is flat, so the tangent bundle manifold formula_2 is locally a product of a curved formula_25 and a flat formula_125 Thus the tangent bundle of the tangent bundle is locally (using formula_126 for &quot;choice of coordinates&quot; and formula_127 for &quot;natural identification&quot;):

:formula_128
and the map formula_129 is the projection onto the first coordinates:
:formula_130
Splitting the first map via the zero section and the second map by the diagonal yields the canonical vector field.

If formula_131 are local coordinates for formula_2, the vector field has the expression

:formula_133

More concisely, formula_134 – the first pair of coordinates do not change because it is the section of a bundle and these are just the point in the base space: the last pair of coordinates are the section itself. This expression for the vector field depends only on formula_135, not on formula_121, as only the tangent directions can be naturally identified.

Alternatively, consider the scalar multiplication function:
:formula_137

The derivative of this function with respect to the variable formula_138 at time formula_139 is a function formula_140, which is an alternative description of the canonical vector field.

The existence of such a vector field on formula_141 is analogous to the canonical one-form on the cotangent bundle. Sometimes formula_142 is also called the Liouville vector field, or radial vector field. Using formula_142 one can characterize the tangent bundle. Essentially, formula_142 can be characterized using 4 axioms, and if a manifold has a vector field satisfying these axioms, then the manifold is a tangent bundle and the vector field is the canonical vector field on it. See for example, De León et al.

==Lifts==
There are various ways to lift objects on formula_1 into objects on formula_141. For example, if formula_147 is a curve in formula_1, then formula_149 (the tangent of formula_147) is a curve in formula_141. In contrast, without further assumptions on formula_152 (say, a Riemannian metric), there is no similar lift into the cotangent bundle.

The &quot;vertical lift&quot; of a function formula_153 is the function formula_154 defined by formula_155, where formula_156 is the canonical projection.

<text>Cyprus Airways (Public) Ltd. (Greek: Κυπριακές Αερογραμμές) was the flag carrier airline of Cyprus. It was established in September 1947 and ceased operations on 9 January 2015. Cyprus Airways had its operating base at Larnaca International Airport.

In July 2016, Charlie Airlines acquired the rights to use the Cyprus Airways trademarks and brand.

==History==

===Early years===
Cyprus Airways was established on 24 September 1947 as a joint venture between the British Colonial Government of Cyprus, holding 40% of the share capital, British European Airways (BEA) and private interests owning the rest of the company. Operations commenced on 18 April 1948 with three Douglas DC-3 aircraft. The planes, which carried 21 passengers each, flew on a route network centred on Nicosia that included Rome, London (via Athens), Beirut, Athens, Cairo, Istanbul, and Haifa. During the next three years the airline purchased an additional three DC-3 aircraft and introduced services to Alexandria, Amman, Bahrain, Khartoum (via Haifa) and Lod.

In its early years, Cyprus Airways was operated effectively as a subsidiary of BEA, not only in its ownership structure, but in its use of BEA crew and cabin staff, and BEA aircraft. In part, this was due to restrictions placed on BEA by the British government on serving destinations further east than Cyprus, as such routes were considered the preserve of BEA&#x27;s rival, British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), although both BEA and BOAC were state-owned airlines at the time. With its control of Cyprus Airways, BEA was able to serve key destinations in the Middle East, including Beirut and Cairo, using Cyprus Airways, whilst maintaining the pretence of not flying beyond Cyprus. Paradoxically it was continuing disputes between BEA and BOAC over this issue that led to the first proposals in 1953 to merge BEA and BOAC to form British Airways.

In 1952, BEA took over the Cyprus Airways service to London with an Airspeed Ambassador, which featured a pressurized cabin that allowed nonstop routing avoiding a stopover in Athens. On 18 April 1953, BEA began using its newly delivered Vickers Viscount 701 on their scheduled service from London to Rome and Athens. The continuing sector from Athens to Nicosia was operated by BEA under charter to Cyprus Airways. This route from London to Nicosia was the world&#x27;s first regular turboprop service.

In 1956, contemplating expansion of its routes, Cyprus Airways ordered two Vickers Viscount 756 aircraft that would be named St Hilarion (registration G-APCD) and Buffavento (G-APCE), but sold them before receiving them because of the deteriorating political situation in Cyprus. It also decided to sell all the Douglas DC-3 and Auster aircraft in September 1957 and entered into a five-year agreement with BEA for the latter to operate services on behalf of Cyprus Airways. As a result, BEA took over the operation of all Cyprus Airways services from 26 January 1958.

===Independence in 1960===
The government of newly independent Cyprus became the majority shareholder in 1960 with a 53.2 percent holding, while BEA&#x27;s stake was reduced to 22.7 percent and private individuals held the rest. Thereafter, Cypriot nationals began to be hired and trained for the flight crews, which had previously been made up of British expatriates from BEA. Cyprus Airways still relied on BEA for aircraft and backroom support. BEA began introducing Comet 4B jets on all routes in 1961 via a joint aircraft pool arrangement that included Greece&#x27;s Olympic Airways.

On 5 April 1960, BEA introduced de Havilland Comet 4B aircraft on the Nicosia, Athens, Rome and London routes. With the introduction of the Comets, Cyprus Airways became the first airline in the Middle East to have jet airplanes. The Comets flew in the BEA livery, but had the Cyprus Airways logo and title above their doors.

In 1965, Cyprus Airways began leasing its own Viscounts from BEA for regional routes. The Comet and Viscount aircraft were replaced with five Trident jets, three of them acquired from BEA. The first Hawker Siddeley Trident jet was introduced in November 1969. Cyprus also leased a BAC 1-11. The faster planes allowed more European trade centres (Frankfurt, Manchester, Brussels, and Paris) to be added to the timetable.

===1974===

At the start of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, the attack on Nicosia airport caught all five of Cyprus Airways aircraft on the ground. Of the four Tridents stranded at Nicosia International Airport one was destroyed by Turkish Air force rocket fire and wreckage of its tail still exists at that airport and one was damaged by small arms fire remaining in the same position today as it did in 1974. The two other Tridents were only lightly damaged by small arms fire and were flown out of Nicosia by British Airways engineers to the United Kingdom in 1977. The team from British Airways was assisted by a British Army team from the UN Peace Keeping (UNFICYP) REME Workshop based in Nicosia.

They used their 6x6 Leyland Recovery vehicle to remove the tail section of one of the destroyed planes and to lift the repaired engines into place. When the Tridents flew out (the Turks would not give permission for test flights, once they took off they were not allowed to return) they were the first planes to use the runway since U Thant flew in and out on a UN flight. One of these is at the Imperial War Museum Duxford, England, although it has been returned to its original BEA livery. Also flown out was the company&#x27;s BAC1-11 which was claimed by the insurers of the lessor, Court-Line, which had gone bankrupt. That aircraft returned to Cyprus Airways in 1978 and served with the company until 1995.
All of the Cypriot airline&#x27;s operations had to be suspended following the end of the hostilities in 1974 because Nicosia International Airport, the only airport of the island, had to be closed. Although the Turkish troops did not capture it, they were close enough to it to demand that it not be reopened. The government of Cyprus then moved quickly to build a small terminal by a runway in Larnaca and Cyprus Airways restarted limited operations from there on 8 February 1975. Specifically the airline leased from British Midland Airways Viscount turboprops to fly a stripped down route network to a few key cities in the region: Beirut, Tel Aviv, and Athens via Heraklion, with connections to London on British Airways. Cyprus Airways leased a pair of DC-9 jets in August 1975 to resume its own flights to London (via Salonika).

The acquisition of a DC-8 several months later allowed for non-stop service. Cyprus also added flights to Saudi Arabia at this time. The company was soon able to order a pair of new BAC 1-11s, added to the sister aircraft already in the fleet. The economic loss of the Turkish invasion to the airline was estimated to be 1.6 million Cypriot pounds. To survive, the airline decided to reduce the salaries of all its employees to a minimum, who accepted it.

The airline ordered still more different aircraft types in the late 1970s which replaced some earlier aircraft coming off lease.

===Expansion in the 1980s===

By 1981, Cyprus&#x27;s fleet included four Boeing 707-123B (1979–1989) and three BAC One-Eleven 500. The route network again extended from Manchester, England, to Baghdad. A change in ownership structure had taken place, with British Airways selling all but 5 percent of the shares it had inherited from BEA to the Cypriot government. Private investors owned the remainder (24.14 percent).

Cyprus made a transition to Airbus aircraft over the course of the decade. Its first A310 widebodies arrived in 1984, followed by A320s in 1989. The order for the eight A320s was worth more than DEM 250 million.

Cyprus Airways was one of the first airlines to operate the Airbus A310, the eighth airline in the world to receive the Airbus A320, and the first airline that launched the IAE V2500 engine along with Adria Airways.

Profits reached record levels in the mid-1980s as the airline added service from new UK cities (Cardiff, Newcastle, and Glasgow). Income of CYP 4.8 million (DEM 8 million) in 1983, a record, would be tripled three years later. By this time, the airline was carrying 740,000 passengers a year.

===1990s===

British Airways divested the last of its shares in 1991, leaving the government with an 80.46 percent stake and private investors, the remainder. The airline was flying high, introducing a livery and uniforms as the Airbuses plied new routes to Berlin and Helsinki. Cyprus Airways had also joined the SABRE international computer reservations system and set up a tour operation in the United Kingdom.

In 1992 the group established Eurocypria Airlines Ltd. to fly European tourists to Cyprus on a charter basis. It was expanding into ancillary services as well, taking over duty-free operations at Larnaca and Pafos airports.

Cyprus added many new cooperation agreements with other airlines as it developed its international reach by linking Europe and the Middle East. Its partners included KLM and Saudia. By the mid-1990s, more than one million passengers were flying Cyprus Airways every year; another 4,000 chose the charter operation Eurocypria. The airline&#x27;s market share approached 40 percent. After a rough couple of years, the company posted a CYP 13 million profit in 1994 thanks to cost-cutting and marketing efforts.

===New millennium===
The airline introduced a restyled livery, as it embarked on an ambitious fleet renewal programme. Two new Airbus A319s, smaller than its other aircraft, were added in 2002. The next year, two new Airbus A330s replaced the older A310s on long-haul routes. A fleet of four Boeing 737s was chosen for the Eurocypria charter subsidiary, however, with two further similar aircraft added in 2004 and 2005. A feature of the new Eurocypria aircraft was that each had a different colour on its tail. In the meantime, the A320s owned by Cyprus Airways but leased to Eurocypria were returned to the parent company.

In 2002, the Cypriot government lowered its ownership stake to 69.62 percent.

Cyprus Airways founded Hellas Jet in Athens (Greece) in 2003, never making a profit. It held a 75% share of that carrier until all of the shares were sold to Air Miles (charter broker) Air Miles in 2005.

In 2006, the government of Cyprus bought Eurocypria because Cyprus Airways started facing severe financial problems.

According to the airline&#x27;s 2010 financial results the operating loss for 2010 was €4,9 million in comparison to a loss of €5,4 million in 2009. On 28 June 2011 Cyprus Airways issued a profits warning to the Cyprus Stock Exchange, attributing this to &quot;the continuing financial crisis and to the further significant increase in fuel prices.&quot;
On 31 August 2011, Cyprus Airways issued its results for the first half of 2011, which showed a loss of €29.3 million, compared to a loss of €25.5 million for the respective period in 2010, representing an increase of €3.8 million.

As a result of a restructuring programme to curb the continued losses, most Middle East destinations were cut from the timetable in 2011/2012, including Bahrain, Cairo, Damascus, Dubai and Jeddah.

===Final years and closure===
In February 2012, due to the poor financial results of the airline, the Cypriot government announced it would increase the airline&#x27;s capital and authorized negotiations for the sale of an unspecified stake of the carrier. , the Cypriot government owned 93.67% of the airline.
raised the share capital of the company and sold the state-owned majority of shares. Negotiations were developing with Aeroflot, which was expected to buy the company if an agreement is reached with the Cypriot government. In May 2012, Cyprus Airways announced that interest was expressed by Triple Five Group, the first official announcement concerning a bidder for the sale of the company. On 23 July 2012, the Cyprus Stock Exchange suspended dealing in Cyprus Airways shares, due to the delay by Cyprus Airways in submitting and publishing its annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011.
A statement to the Cyprus Stock Exchange on 4 March 2013 gave the results for Cyprus Airways Group for the year ended 31 December 2012 as a loss after tax of €55,8 million in comparison to a loss of €23,9 million in 2011.
The European Commission announced on 6 March 2013 that it has opened an investigation into whether the Cypriot government&#x27;s €73 million rescue loan in December 2012 and €31.3 million contribution to a capital increase in January 2013 are in breach of EU rules on state aid.

On 13 March 2014 Cyprus Airways confirmed the sale of its second slot at London Heathrow Airport to the Lebanese company Middle East Airlines for €6.3 million.

The airline ceased operations on 9 January 2015 following a policy made by the European Commission that the state aid paid to the airline by the Government of Cyprus was illegal and had to be returned by the company. This effectively caused Cyprus Airways to be bankrupt. Notably, air connectivity rose by 15 per cent in the first six months of 2016 compared with an increase of 3.6 per cent in 2015, the year when Cyprus Airways went into bankruptcy.

===Restart of operations===

In July 2016, the Cypriot government announced that the Cypriot start-up company Charlie Airlines Ltd was the winning bidder in a competition carried out by the finance ministry about the usage of the Cyprus Airways Brand for a period of ten years. Charlie Airlines has been built by a consortium of local investors that hold 60% of the airline and Russia&#x27;s S7 Airlines, that holds 40% as a joint-venture. S7 is currently Russia&#x27;s largest domestic carrier and transported 10.6 million passengers in 2015. S7 CEO Vladislav Filev said that the Charlie name was inspired by the nickname handed to expatriated Cypriots that had left the island. S7 will provide two Airbus A319-100 aircraft to start operations to destinations in the UK, Greece and Russia. Charlie Airlines Ltd filed an application to receive a local Air operator&#x27;s certificate and acquire the right to use the Cyprus Airways trademarks for ten years for 2 million euros.

Full annual reports and accounts were issued up until 2007, but as the airline&#x27;s financial position deteriorated, so the annual accounts became briefer. The 2012 figures are only from press reports, and are unaudited.:
&quot;*Unaudited figures; loss shown is after tax.&quot;

==Destinations==
, Cyprus Airways served 12-year-round destinations in 10 countries, all in Europe and the Middle East.

On 25 July 2011, Cyprus Airways signed a code-share agreement with Virgin Atlantic, allowing the Cypriot market to travel to Boston, New York, Newark, Los Angeles, Manchester, Edinburgh and Aberdeen on flights operated by Virgin using both Virgin and Cyprus Airways flight numbers, with connecting flights at London–Heathrow. Services from London Heathrow to Larnaca were operated by Cyprus Airways aircraft with flight numbers both of Cyprus Airways and Virgin Atlantic.

==Fleet==

Prior to the airline&#x27;s shutdown, Cyprus Airways had a fleet of fourteen Airbus A320 aircraft of an average age of 11.3 years. All aircraft bore names of Cypriot landmarks and cities.

===Past fleet===
Cyprus Airways operated the following aircraft types:

===Livery===

The airline&#x27;s livery was an all white fuselage with the words &#x27;CYPRUS AIRWAYS&#x27; in blue over the front passenger windows. The vertical stabilizer was blue, with yellow lines depicting a galloping Cypriot mouflon, a type of wild sheep only found in Cyprus. This logo was also painted on the engines of the aircraft. The galloping mouflon logo was designed in 1962 by David Collins on the instruction of BEA. The first aircraft to display the mouflon design were De Havilland Comet 4B aircraft by the passenger door entrance.

===Catering===
Food and beverages served on flights from Cyprus were provided by Cyprus Airways Catering facilities in Larnaca. Meals were selected from an array of international and Cypriot foods.

===In-flight entertainment===
In-flight entertainment was introduced by Cyprus Airways on its Airbus A319 aircraft upon delivery in 2002, and its A320s were retrofitted at the same time.

On the A320 family aircraft, there were television screens placed along the aircraft. Sound was provided through headsets given by the cabin crew. Screens had a moving-map system which provided real-time flight information such as position and direction of the plane, altitude, airspeed, distance to destination, distance from origination, and local time.

The larger A330 aircraft, operated between 2002 and 2011 and used mainly on longer flights to London Heathrow, Paris, and Amsterdam, but also occasionally to Manchester, Athens, and Zurich, had individual screens for each passenger, mounted on the back of the seats, offering many more options in video and audio entertainment.

===Business class===
Business class was named after the ancient Greek god Apollo, who was a symbol of harmony, order, and reason. Apollo class had wide leather seats that reclined by up to 45 inches (110 cm) of pitch and featured electrical recline and leg rest. Apollo-class passengers also had access to the Sunjet executive lounges at both Larnaca and Paphos airports.

Apollo class included a personal entertainment system, built into the armrest of the high-standard seats. Additionally, meals were served to business class passengers, with a selection of international and Cypriot cuisine on offer. Drinks and wine were offered on all flights.

===Economy class===
Economy class was named after the ancient Greek goddess Aphrodite, who, according to Greek mythology, was a symbol of beauty and elegance. Cyprus Airways&#x27; Aphrodite (economy) Class offered a seat pitch of 30-31 inches.

Depending on the destination and time of the flight, a hot breakfast, lunch, or cold snack was served. The tray included a seasonal salad and dessert, as well as crackers and halloumi cheese. Drinks, including coffee or tea and soft drinks, were offered.
===SunMiles===
SunMiles was the frequent flyer programme of Cyprus Airways. There were four tiers of membership: Student, Regular, Premier, and Elite. Points were credited per each one-way flight on Cyprus Airways. Economy class passengers gained 1 point per kilometer, and Business class passengers gained 1.5 points per kilometer.

===Awards===
Cyprus Airways was awarded the &#x27;Commitment to Excellence in Europe&#x27; award by the European Foundation of Quality Management (EFQM) in 2007.

Cyprus Airways was also awarded the &#x27;IATA Best In-flight Programming for a European airline&#x27; award.

==Incidents and accidents==
* On 21 December 1961, British European Airways Flight 226, a De Havilland Comet 4B, owned and operated by British European Airways (BEA) on behalf of Cyprus Airways, crashed immediately after takeoff from Ankara. The probable cause was instrument failure. Seven of the 34 people on board survived. The four cabin crew were Cyprus Airways employees.
* On 12 October 1967, Cyprus Airways Flight 284 broke up in midair on a flight between Athens and Nicosia, most likely as a result of the detonation of an explosive device. All 66 people on board died. Similar to the 1961 accident, the De Havilland Comet 4B aircraft was owned and operated by British European Airways (BEA), though cabin staff were Cyprus Airways employees.

<doc id="211800" wikidata="Q6113739" url="?curid=211800" title="Jack Longland">
<text>Sir John Laurence Longland (26 June 1905 – 29 November 1993) was a British educator, mountain climber, and broadcaster.

After a brilliant student career Longland became a don at Durham University in the 1930s. He formed a lifelong concern for the welfare of unemployed people, and after a time working in community service he moved to become an educational administrator, retiring in 1970. Among his achievements was the establishment of White Hall in Derbyshire, the country&#x27;s first local authority Outdoor Pursuits Centre for young people.

As a young man Longland was prominent among British rock-climbers, taking a distinguished part in the 1933 British Mount Everest expedition. Later in life he was active in the affairs of the British Mountaineering Council.

Longland was a familiar broadcaster on BBC Radio, appearing regularly from the late 1940s until the 1970s in the long-running &quot;Round Britain Quiz&quot;, &quot;Any Questions?&quot;, and the panel game &quot;My Word!&quot;, which he chaired for twenty years from 1957.

==Life and career==
Longland was the eldest son of the Rev E. H. Longland (successively curate of Hagley, vicar of St Paul&#x27;s, Warwick (1908–16) rector of St Nicholas&#x27;s Droitwich (1916–27), and vicar of Cropthorne (1927)) and his wife, Emily, elder daughter of Sir James Crockett. Longland was educated at the King&#x27;s School, Worcester, and Jesus College, Cambridge, where he was Rustat Exhibitioner and scholar, won a Blue for pole-vaulting, and gained a first in Part I of the Historical Tripos in 1926, and first class honours with distinction in the English Tripos in 1927. He finished second behind Howard Ford in the pole jump event at the 1929 AAA Championships. 

After graduating, Longland was elected Charles Kingsley bye-fellow of Magdalene College for two years, and then spent a year in Germany as Austausch-student at Königsberg University, where he witnessed the early rise of Adolf Hitler.

While still in his twenties Longland established a reputation as a mountaineer. He liked to say that he started out &quot;with a clothes line and a pair of old army boots&quot;, but in the words of an obituarist, &quot;as a rock-climber he was brilliant. He will always be remembered for &#x27;Longland&#x27;s Climb&#x27;, on Clogwyn Du&#x27;r Arddu, in Snowdonia, the first route right up that formidable crag. It gave him enormous pleasure to climb that route again with his son over 40 years later.&quot; He was a member of two major British expeditions – in 1933 to Everest and in 1935 to East Greenland. In the words of &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;His place in Everest legend remains secure, if only for his 1933 feat in bringing down eight sherpas from Camp Six to Base Camp after a blizzard had produced whiteout conditions obliterating all traces of their upward route.&quot; He was invited to go on the 1938 Everest expedition, but declined, being by then heavily involved with public service work in England.

Longland&#x27;s first full-time academic post was as lecturer in English at Durham University from 1930 to 1936. In 1934 he married Margaret Lowrey Harrison in a ceremony conducted by the Bishop of Durham (Hensley Henson) assisted by Longland senior and two other clergymen. There were two sons and two daughters of the marriage.

During his time at Durham, Longland became increasingly concerned at the social problems caused by the Great Depression and unemployment in the Durham coalfields, and became an active member of the Labour Party. He said later:

He left the university to become deputy director of Durham&#x27;s Community Service Council, taking over as director a year later. From 1940 until his retirement in 1970 he worked in the management of education, as deputy education officer for Hertfordshire (1940–42), director of education for Dorset (1942–49) and for Derbyshire (1949–70). In tandem with his main official duties he was Regional Officer of the National Council of Social Service, 1939–40, president of the Association of Education Officers, 1960–61, and chairman of the Mountain Leadership Training Board &amp; Plas y Brenin, 1964–80. He was also a member of eighteen national commissions, committees and advisory bodies.. In his Derbyshire post in 1950 he set up the first local authority Outdoor Pursuits Centre (White Hall). As a member of the Countryside Commission from 1969 to 1974 he played an important part in bringing increased protection for the countryside responsible, writing the commission&#x27;s report that persuaded the government to strengthen the powers of National Park committees.

In addition to his public service work, Longland was a frequent and popular broadcaster on BBC Radio. In the late 1940s and 1950s he was the chairman of the series &quot;Country Questions&quot; in which a team of experts answered listeners&#x27; questions about the countryside; he was a panellist and later a question-master on the long-running &quot;Round Britain Quiz&quot;, and was a frequent member of the &quot;Any Questions?&quot; panel. He was in the chair for series for younger listeners, including &quot;The Younger Generation Question Time&quot; and &quot;Summer Parade&quot;. From August 1957 he succeeded John Arlott as chairman of the panel game &quot;My Word!&quot;, and remained in the role until he retired in December 1977. He was described in &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;the perfect chairman, courteous, receptive, self-effacing and clearly well liked by the team&quot;.

In 1990 Longland gave an address at a gathering to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the birth of Sir George Everest, the Surveyor General of India, after whom the mountain was named. The Royal Geographical Society hosted a gathering of climbers who had made or attempted the ascent of Everest. Among them were Lord Hunt, leader of the first successful British expedition in 1953, and Sir Edmund Hillary, who first climbed the mountain with Tenzing Norgay. Chris Bonington, Doug Scott, Stephen Venables and Harry Taylor talked of the post-war achievements, and Longland spoke about the early attempts on the mountain.

Longland was knighted on his retirement in 1970 and was elected as President of the Alpine Club (UK) (1974-1976). In his last years he was distressed, in the words of &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;to sit by and watch his educational work being undone by successively tougher Conservative secretaries of state.&quot; He died at the age of 88. His wife and one of his sons predeceased him.

<text>Elizabeth Dilys Powell (20 July 1901 – 3 June 1995) was a British film critic and travel writer who contributed to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; for more than 50 years. Powell was known for her receptiveness to cultural change in the cinema and coined many classic phrases about films and actors. She was a founding member of the Independent Television Authority (ITA), which launched commercial television in the UK. She was also the second female president of the Classical Association. Powell wrote several books on films and her travels in Greece.

==Early life and education==
Dilys Powell was born in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, to Thomas Powell (a bank manager) and Mary Jane Lloyd. She attended Talbot Heath School, Bournemouth before winning an exhibition to read Modern Languages at Somerville College, Oxford. 

Powell considered studying Classics (Literae Humaniores) – &quot;Greats&quot; – at Oxford University, but she was advised against it by her brother: &#x27;&quot;Don&#x27;t&quot; he said; &quot;the Classics are a terrible grind for a girl, and you will be prematurely wrinkled.&quot;&#x27; Powell took his advice, but later regretted it, feeling that she had been robbed of &quot;deep and solid pleasures&quot;, having &quot;small Latin...and, goodness knows, less Greek&quot;.

At Oxford, Powell met an archaeologist, Humfry Payne (19 February 1902 – 9 May 1936), whom she married in 1926. While studying at Oxford, she made news headlines in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; after being &quot;taken out for tea&quot; and climbing over the wall to go out with Payne; she was rusticated for two terms and the principal accused her of &quot;dragging the name of Somerville in the dust&quot;. She graduated with a first-class honours degree in Modern Languages in 1923.

==Career==
After graduation, Powell spent a period as personal assistant to Lady Ottoline Morrell before joining the literary department of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 1928.

In 1929, her husband Humfry Payne was appointed director of the British School at Athens. From 1931 to 1936, Powell spent part of each year in Greece, frequently attending excavations where her husband was working, including the excavation of the Heraion of Perachora, as well as attending an excavation at Abydos, Egypt. Payne died in Athens in 1936 from a staphylococcus infection. They had no children.

Powell continued her periodic visits to Greece after 1936, until the Second World War made travel difficult. In 1939 Powell was appointed film critic at &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. In 1941, she found war work with a Greek connection in the Political Warfare Executive, which oversaw Britain&#x27;s propaganda in occupied Europe; she remained there until 1945, where she was tasked with making sure that the BBC&#x27;s broadcasts to Greece accurately represented British policies. In June 1943, she married Leonard Russell (1906–1974), the literary editor at &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. 

Powell was one of the founding members of the Independent Television Authority (ITA) from 1954, despite initial concerns about her possible conflicts of interest (she wrote for a newspaper that was backing one of the ITV network franchises, but its bid was eventually withdrawn). She resigned her post at the ITA in 1956, in protest at the government&#x27;s refusal to come up with funding which it had promised to the authority in the Television Act 1954. She was a long-time regular panel member of the BBC radio word game, &quot;My Word!&quot;.

Powell&#x27;s journalism led a change in the writing of cinema criticism. To quote the British Film Institute: &quot;she was open to new directions in cinema and was not constrained by the middle class shibboleths of &#x27;good taste&#x27;, unlike her rival C. A. Lejeune, film critic for &quot;The Observer&quot; from 1928 to 1960.&quot; She remained film critic at &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; until 1979 – a compilation of her reviews was published in 1989 as &quot;The Golden Screen&quot; – but from 1976 she also began writing about films on television, which she continued to do until the end of her life. Her last piece, a review of &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;, appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; on the day of her death. She also served as film critic for &quot;Punch&quot; until its first closure in 1992.

Powell, a philhellene, made frequent visits to Greece, including attending the British School at Athens excavations at Emporio on Chios in 1954 in order to report on the excavations for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. She was the author of several books about the country, including &quot;Remember Greece&quot; (1941); &quot;An Affair of the Heart&quot; (1958), describing her repeated visits to the village of Perachora, site of Payne&#x27;s excavations of the Heraion; and &quot;The Villa Ariadne&quot; (1973), a memoir of the archaeologists associated with the house built by Sir Arthur Evans near the palace of Knossos, including several (such as John Pendlebury) who were active in the Cretan Resistance during World War II. Other works include a biography of Payne, &quot;The Traveller&#x27;s Journey is Done&quot; (1943). Powell served as president of the Classical Association from 1966 to 1967, giving her presidential address at the University of Reading on 5 April 1967. She was only the second female President of the Classical Association, following Professor Dorothy Tarrant (President 1958-1959). Powell was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1974, awarded a British Film Institute Fellowship in 1983, and made an Honorary Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford University, in 1991. Powell was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. She served as a Governor of the British Film Institute from 1948 to 1952.

In 1991, the Critics&#x27; Circle Theatre Award established the annual Dilys Powell Award for Excellence in Film in her honour. The first recipient of the award was Dirk Bogarde; other recipients have included Christopher Lee, Richard Attenborough, Judi Dench, Helena Bonham Carter, Kenneth Branagh, and Kate Winslet.

<text>The Canon Court de 105 M(montagne) modèle 1909 Schneider (105 mm mle.1909) was a French mountain gun, manufactured by Schneider et Cie. According to &quot;Kennblätter fremden Geräts&quot;, Germany used the former French gun as the 10.5 cm GebH 343(f). The gun could be towed by a horse or mule.

According to Russian sources the 105 M Mle 1909 was evaluated and found suitable for Russian use, but needed to be rebuilt to accept 107mm Russian ammunition and was never used by Russian army. (Encyclopedia of the Soviet Artillery by Shirokorad A. B. and others).

<doc id="211810" wikidata="Q16998384" url="?curid=211810" title="My Music (radio programme)">
<text>My Music was a British radio panel show which premiered on the BBC Home Service on 3 January 1967. It was a companion programme to &quot;My Word!&quot;, and like that show featured comic writers Denis Norden and Frank Muir. The show was last recorded in November 1993 and broadcast in January 1994, then rebroadcast until 2011. It was also broadcast via the BBC World Service. There was also a television version on BBC2 which ran for seven series between 1977 and 1983.

==Description==
&quot;My Music&quot; followed &quot;My Word!&quot;&#x27;s pattern of two teams of two competing in a series of challenges, based this time on music rather than words. Again, the quiz element was subordinate to the entertainment. In later years, each episode featured a final round in which each contestant was required to sing a song, regardless of his vocal ability. Initially, this was a genuine test of whether the contestants knew the songs, but later the songs were always ones that they were certain to know. Indeed, towards the end Denis Norden decided what song he would sing, supplying some rather bizarre ones. Many of these were written by the English music hall songwriters R. P. Weston and Bert Lee.

The teams were:
* 1967–1973: Ian Wallace and Denis Norden versus David Franklin and Frank Muir
* 1973: Ian Wallace and Denis Norden versus Owen Brannigan and Frank Muir
* 1974–1994: Ian Wallace and Denis Norden versus John Amis and Frank Muir (these four participants also contested the TV version)

The show was hosted for its entire run by composer Steve Race, who also set the challenges (after an early period in which they were set by show creator Edward J. Mason) and provided piano accompaniment where appropriate (except in the first five series, in which accompaniment was provided by Graham Dalley on mellotron). Neither Race nor Wallace missed a single one of the more than 520 episodes broadcast.

Graham Dalley, the show&#x27;s first accompanist, also composed the signature tune, and his original mellotron version was used from 1967 to 1975. A new arrangement of the theme, featuring trumpets, bass guitar, electric guitar, conga drums, and cabasa, was used from 1976, and was succeeded in 1983 by an arrangement for piano and harpsichord, composed by Steve Race.

Producers of the programme included Tony Shryane and Pete Atkin.

In the United States, the show was syndicated on the WFMT Fine Arts Network until 1 October 2013, when BBC ended US distribution.

<text>The crab-plover or crab plover (&quot;Dromas ardeola)&quot; is a coastal wader (shorebird). It is the only member of the genus &quot;Dromas&quot; and the family Dromadidae. It is unique among waders in making use of ground warmth to aid the incubation of its eggs. The crab-plover is classified in the suborder Lari, making it more closely related to gulls and auks than to most other waders such as plovers (suborder Charadrii) and sandpipers (suborder Scolopaci).

==Description==

This bird resembles a plover, but has very long grey legs and a strong heavy black bill similar to a tern. Its black-and-white plumage and long-necked upright posture with heavy bill makes it distinctive and unmistakable. Its bill is unique among waders, and specialised for eating crabs. It has partially webbed toes. The plumage is white except for black on its back and in the primary feathers of the wings. They are noisy birds, calling frequently on their breeding sites and in their wintering grounds. The usual call is a &quot;ka&quot; similar to that of the bar-tailed godwit but repeated rapidly. Flocks may produce a whinnying sound that rises and at in the breeding season produce whistling &quot;kew-ki-ki&quot; notes.

Males and females are not easily distinguished but males have a heavier and longer bill. Juveniles have the black on the mantle, greyish and remain in this plumage for a year. Flocks fly in lines or &quot;V&quot; formations.

The crab-plover is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

==Range ==
It is resident on the coasts and islands of the Indian Ocean, where it feeds on crabs and other small animals. They are gregarious and will feed in large groups, at night and during dawn and dusk as well as during the day; this crepuscular and nocturnal behaviour is more common during the breeding season. They breed around the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf, Red Sea and Somalia in the months of April to July then disperse across the Indian Ocean in August as far as the Andaman Islands and Sri Lanka in the east and Tanzania and Madagascar.

==Habits==

The crab-plover is unusual for waders in that it nests in burrows in sandy banks. In the Red Sea region, the breeding season begins around the middle of May. It is a colonial breeder, nesting in colonies as large 1500 pairs. It lays one white egg, occasionally two, which are large for its body size. The nest burrow temperature is optimal due to solar radiation and the parents are able to leave the nest unattended for as long as 58 hours. The chicks are also unique for the usually nidifugous waders in being unable to walk and remain in the nest for several days after hatching, having food brought to them. Even once they fledge they have a long period of parental care afterwards. Both males and females take care of the young.

<doc id="211816" wikidata="Q10508" url="?curid=211816" title="Circinus">
<text>Circinus is a small, faint constellation in the southern sky, first defined in 1756 by the French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille. Its name is Latin for compass, referring to the drafting tool used for drawing circles (it should not be confused with Pyxis, a constellation that represents a mariner&#x27;s compass which points north). Its brightest star is Alpha Circini, with an apparent magnitude of 3.19. Slightly variable, it is the brightest rapidly oscillating Ap star in the night sky. AX Circini is a Cepheid variable visible with the unaided eye, and BX Circini is a faint star thought to have been formed from the merger of two white dwarfs. Two sun-like stars have planetary systems: HD 134060 has two small planets, and HD 129445 has a Jupiter-like planet. Supernova SN 185 appeared in Circinus in 185 AD and was recorded by Chinese observers. Two novae have been observed more recently, in the 20th century.

The Milky Way runs through the constellation, featuring prominent objects such as the open cluster NGC 5823 and the planetary nebula NGC 5315. Circinus hosts a notable spiral galaxy, the Circinus Galaxy, discovered in 1977; it is the closest Seyfert galaxy to the Milky Way. The Alpha Circinids (ACI), a meteor shower also discovered in 1977, radiate from this constellation.

==History==
In 1756, French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille introduced the constellation of Circinus with the French name &quot;le Compas&quot;, representing a pair of dividing compasses, on a chart of the southern sky. On that chart, Lacaille portrayed the constellations of Norma, Circinus, and Triangulum Australe, respectively, as a set square and ruler, a compass, and a surveyor&#x27;s level in a set of draughtsman&#x27;s instruments. Circinus was given its current name in 1763, when Lacaille published an updated sky map with Latin names for the constellations he introduced.

==Characteristics==
Bordered by Centaurus, Musca, Apus, Triangulum Australe, Norma and Lupus, Circinus lies adjacent to the Alpha and Beta Centauri stars. As it is at declination −50° to −70°, the whole constellation is only visible south of latitude 30° N. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 14 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , and the declination coordinates are between −55.43° and −70.62°. Circinus culminates each year at 9 p.m. on 30 July. The recommended three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;Cir&quot;.

==Features==
===Stars===
Circinus is a faint constellation, with only one star brighter than fourth magnitude. Alpha Circini, a white main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 3.19, is 54 light-years away and 4° south of Alpha Centauri. Not only the brightest star in the constellation, it is also the brightest example of a rapidly oscillating Ap (RoAp) star in the night sky. It has the unusual spectral type A7 Vp SrCrEu, showing increased emissions of strontium, chromium and europium. Stars of this type have oddly localised magnetic fields and are slightly variable. Alpha Circini forms a binary star system with an orange dwarf companion of spectral type K5 and magnitude 8.5, which with a separation of 5.7 arcseconds is only discernible with a telescope. The distance between the two stars is 260 AU and they take 2600 years to rotate around a common centre of gravity. The second brightest star is Beta Circini, a white main sequence star of spectral type A3Va and a magnitude of 4.07, about 100 light-years away. It has around 1.8 times the diameter of the Sun.

Gamma Circini is a binary star 450 light-years away, whose components need a telescope of 150 mm to be seen, as they are only 0.8 arcseconds apart. The brighter component is a bluish Be star of spectral type B5IV+ and magnitude 4.51, while the dimmer component is a yellow star of magnitude 5.5. They orbit each other every 180 years. Delta Circini is also a multiple star whose components have magnitudes of 5.1 and 13.4 and orbit around a common centre of gravity every 3.9 days. The brighter component is a close eclipsing binary (specifically, a rotating ellipsoidal variable), with a minor dip of magnitude (0.1). Both are hot blue stars of spectral types O7III-V and O9.5V, respectively, and are estimated to have around 22 and 12 times the Sun&#x27;s mass. Over 3600 light-years away, this system would outshine Venus at magnitude −4.8 if it were 32 light-years (10 parsecs) distant. The two main components are separated by 50 arcseconds, resolvable to the naked eye for individuals with good vision and easily discernible with a telescope.

Eta Circini is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III and magnitude 5.17, located around 276 light-years distant, and Zeta Circini is a blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B3V and magnitude 6.09, located around 1273 light-years away.

493 variable stars have been recorded in Circinus, but most have a very small range or are quite dim. Three prominent examples are Theta Circini, T Circini, and AX Circini. Theta Circini is a B-class irregular variable, ranging in magnitude from 5.0 to 5.4. T Circini has a B-type spectrum, ranging in magnitude from 10.6 to 9.3 over a period of 3.298 days, although it is actually an eclipsing binary system rather than a pulsating star. AX is a Cepheid variable that varies between magnitudes 5.6 and 6.19 over 5.3 days. It is a yellow-white supergiant of spectral type F8II+, 1600 light-years away. BP Circini is another Cepheid variable with an apparent magnitude ranging from 7.37 to 7.71 over 2.4 days. Both cepheids are spectroscopic binaries, with companions that are blue-white stars of spectral type B6 and 5 and 4.7 solar masses, respectively. BX Circini is a faint star that fluctuates between magnitudes 12.57 and 12.62 over a period of 2 hours 33 minutes. Over 99% of its composition appears to be helium. Its origin is unclear, but thought to be the result of the merger of a helium and a carbon/oxygen white dwarf.

Several stars with planetary systems lie within the borders of Circinus, although none of the host stars are particularly prominent. HD 134060 is a sun-like yellow dwarf star of spectral type G0VFe+0.4 and magnitude 6.29, around 79 light-years away. Its two planets were discovered in 2011 through the radial velocity method: the smaller, HD 134060 b, has a mass of 0.0351 MJ (Jupiter masses) and orbits its star every 3.27 days, at 0.0444 AU; the larger, HD 134060 c (0.15 MJ), orbits farther out at 2.226 AU, with a period of approximately 1161 days. Even fainter, at magnitude 8.8, HD 129445 is 220 light-years away and has 99% of the Sun&#x27;s mass and a similar spectral type of G8V. HD 129445 b, a Jupiter-like planet (1.6 MJ) discovered in 2010 via the radial velocity method, orbits this star at a distance of 2.9 AU, approximately every 1840 days.

As this constellation intersects the plane of the Milky Way, there are many massive stars located in this constellation, including GKF2010 MN18 (or simply MN18), a blue supergiant located in a bipolar nebula, as well as 9 Wolf-Rayet stars, a very high number for such a small constellation.

===Deep-sky objects===

Three open clusters and a planetary nebulae are found within the borders of Circinus, all visible with amateur telescopes of varying sizes. NGC 5823, also called Caldwell 88, is an 800-million-year-old open cluster, located 3500 light-years away and spanning a 12-light-year region along the constellation&#x27;s northern border. Despite having an integrated magnitude of 7.9, the cluster can be seen by star hopping from Beta Circini or from Alpha Centauri. It contains 80–100 stars of 10th magnitude and fainter, which are spread out over a diameter of 10 arcseconds. The brighter stars, however, are not true members of the cluster, as they are closer to the Earth than the dimmer ones. NGC 5823 appears distinct to the observer, sometimes seen as a reversed &quot;S&quot;, as described by John Herschel, although it has also been described as &quot;tulip-shaped&quot; and &quot;boxy&quot;. That cluster can be easily mistaken with a similar cluster, NGC 5822, nearby in Lupus. Comparatively, open cluster NGC 5715 is fainter (integrated magnitude of 9.8)—its brightest star is only 11th magnitude—and smaller (7.0 arcminutes), comprising only 30 stars. The third open cluster, Pismis 20, contains 12 stars in a diameter of 4.5 arcseconds but exhibits a magnitude similar to NGC 5823 (7.8). At 8270 light-years, it requires an amateur telescope with an aperture over 300 mm to be easily discerned.
The planetary nebula NGC 5315 has a magnitude of 9.8 around a central star of magnitude 14.2, located 5.2 degrees west-southwest of Alpha Circini. It is only visible as a disc at magnifications over 200-fold. Bernes 145 is a dark and reflection nebula first listed in the 1971 Bernes Catalog. The dark nebula component is easily visible in a large amateur telescope, and it measures 12 by 5 arcminutes. The smaller reflection nebula component requires a larger instrument and averted vision to be seen.

Circinus also houses ESO 97-G13, commonly known as the Circinus Galaxy. Discovered in 1977, it is a relatively unobscured galaxy (magnitude 10.6), which is unusual for galaxies located in constellations near the Milky Way, since their dim light is obscured by gas and dust. This oblong spiral galaxy with 6.9 by 3.0 arcminutes and 26,000 light-years in diameter, is located 13 million light-years away from Earth and lies 4 degrees off the galactic plane. It is the closest Seyfert galaxy to the Milky Way, and therefore hosts an active galactic nucleus.
Circinus X-1 is an X-ray binary star system that includes a neutron star. Observations of Circinus X-1 in July 2007 revealed the presence of X-ray jets normally found in black hole systems. Located at 19,000 light-years, the pulsar PSR B1509-58, also called the Circinus Pulsar, has expelled a 20-light-year-long jet of material from its southern pole, clearly visible in the X-ray spectrum. Another supernova remnant in Circinus is that of SN 185. Recorded by Chinese observers in 185 AD, SN 185 was visible in the night sky for around eight months; its remnants, known as RCW 86, cover an area larger than the typical full moon.

A white dwarf star in a close binary system can accumulate material from its companion until it ignites and blows off in a thermonuclear explosion, known as a nova. These stars generally brighten by 7 to 16 magnitudes. Nova Circini 1926, also known as X Circini, was observed at magnitude 6.5 on 3 September 1926, before fading and fluctuating between magnitudes 11.7 and 12.5, during 1928, and magnitude 13, in 1929. Nova Circini 1995 (BY Circini) reached a maximum apparent magnitude of 7.2 in January 1995. BW Circini is a low mass X-ray binary system, comprising a black hole of around 8 solar masses and a yellow G0III-G5III subgiant star. X-ray outbursts were recorded in 1987 and 1997, and possibly 1971–72.

===Meteor showers===
Circinus is the radiant of an annual meteor shower, the Alpha Circinids (ACI). First observed in Queensland in 1977, the meteors have an average velocity of 27.1 km/s and are thought to be associated with a long-period comet. In 2011, Peter Jenniskens proposed that the debris trail of comet C/1969 T1 could intersect with the Earth&#x27;s orbit and generate a meteor outburst coming from a radiant close to Beta Circini. The ACI shower peaks on 4 June, the day it was first observed.

<text>Volans is a constellation in the southern sky. It represents a flying fish; its name is a shortened form of its original name, Piscis Volans. Volans was one of twelve constellations created by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman and it first appeared on a 35-cm (14&quot;) diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer&#x27;s &quot;Uranometria&quot; of 1603.

==History==

Volans is one of the 12 constellations that were introduced by the Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman in the late 16th century. It was first depicted on Petrus Plancius’ globe in 1598. Plancius called the constellation &quot;Vliegendenvis&quot; (flying fish).

In 1603, Johann Bayer included the constellation in his star atlas &quot;Uranometria&quot; under the name Piscis Volans, the flying fish. John Herschel proposed shrinking the name to one word in 1844, noting that Lacaille himself had abbreviated his constellations thus on occasion. This was universally adopted.

Volans represents a type of tropical fish that can jump out of the water and glide through the air on wings. In early celestial maps, the flying fish was often depicted as accompanying the ship Argo Navis, and being chased by the predatory fish represented by the adjoining constellation Dorado.

On 10 May 2023, TOI-715 b, the first exoplanet in the conservative habitable zone, about 1.55 times larger than Earth, was discovered in Volans by TESS.

==Features==

===Stars===

There are two double stars within the constellation which can be observed using a small telescope, Gamma Volantis and Epsilon Volantis, along with two galaxies which may be more difficult to see clearly, NGC 2442 and NGC 2434. The magnitudes of the Gamma Volantis stars are 3.8 and 5.6, and of Epsilon Volantis 4.4 and 7.3.

The Astronomical Society of Southern Africa in 2003 reported that observations of the variable stars R and S Volantis in Volans were very urgently needed as data on their light curves was incomplete.

HD 76700 is a sunlike star some 195 light-years distant that has been found to have a planet.

===Deep-sky objects===
Volans has several deep-sky objects within its borders.

The Lindsay-Shapley ring, also categorized as AM0644-741, is a ring galaxy located 300 million light-years from Earth. Named for its discoverers, the Lindsay-Shapley ring was found near the Large Magellanic Cloud in 1960. Like the Cartwheel Galaxy in Sculptor, the unusual shape of this galaxy results from a collision many millions of years ago. The blue ring, 150,000 light-years in diameter, was formed when a shock wave from the collision created a ring of hot blue stars; the yellow core is an amalgamation of the progenitors&#x27; cores. NGC 2442, an intermediate-spiral galaxy, is also located in this constellation, with a distance of 50 million light-years from Earth.

Graham&#x27;s Object, aka Das Rheingold or Nibelungen Ring is a ring shaped galaxy at R.A. 6h 41.4m / Decl. -74° 19&#x27; (2000.0) in Volans

<text>Reticulum is a small, faint constellation in the southern sky. Its name is Latin for a small net, or reticle—a net of crosshairs at the focus of a telescope eyepiece that is used to measure star positions. The constellation is best viewed between October and December, and save for one main star visible in ideal conditions, cannot be seen from north of the 30th parallel north.

==History==
A constellation in this area was introduced by Isaac Habrecht II in his celestial globe in 1621, who named it &quot;Rhombus&quot;. It was replaced with a somewhat different constellation by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in the eighteenth century; during his stay at the Cape of Good Hope, he named the constellation le Réticule Rhomboide to commemorate the reticle in his telescope eyepiece. The name was later Latinized to Reticulum in his star catalogue &quot;Coelum Australe Stelliferum&quot;. In 1810, the stars of Reticulum were used by William Croswell to produce the constellation &quot;Marmor Sculptile&quot;, which represented the bust of Christopher Columbus, but this did not catch on among astronomers.

The constellation Reticulum became officially recognized during the First General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union in 1922. The boundary for this and other constellations was drawn up by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte along arcs of right ascension and declination for epoch 1875. These were published in 1930 in the &quot;Delimination Scientifique des Constellations&quot; at the behest of the IAU.

==Features==

Only two of the stars in this constellation are brighter than visual magnitude 5: Alpha (α) and Beta (β) reticuli. The reddish star R Reticuli is a Mira variable. This variable was discovered by C. Ragoonatha Chary at the Madras Observatory in India.

The binary star system Epsilon Reticuli consists of a spectral class K2IV star being orbited by a white dwarf. Based on parallax measurements, this system is located about 50 light years from the Sun. In 2000, a planetary companion was announced, orbiting the star ε Reticuli A.

Zeta Reticuli is a wide binary star system, with both members being similar to the Sun. It is located at a distance of about 39 light years. This system gained some notoriety in ufology when the alleged alien abductees Betty and Barney Hill named it as the home of their abductors.

In 2005, a type Ia supernova was discovered in the spiral galaxy NGC 1559, located in the constellation.

The dwarf galaxy Reticulum II is enriched in r-process heavy elements.

The Horologium-Reticulum Supercluster is a galaxy supercluster that ranges from 700 million to 1.2 billion light-years from Earth.

<doc id="211820" wikidata="Q10486" url="?curid=211820" title="Pictor">
<text>Pictor is a constellation in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere, located between the star Canopus and the Large Magellanic Cloud. Its name is Latin for painter, and is an abbreviation of the older name Equuleus Pictoris (the &quot;painter&#x27;s easel&quot;). Normally represented as an easel, Pictor was named by Abbé Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in the 18th century. The constellation&#x27;s brightest star is Alpha Pictoris, a white main-sequence star around 97 light-years away from Earth. Pictor also hosts RR Pictoris, a cataclysmic variable star system that flared up as a nova, reaching apparent (visual) magnitude 1.2 in 1925 before fading into obscurity.

Pictor has attracted attention because of its second-brightest star Beta Pictoris, 63.4 light-years distant from Earth, which is surrounded by an unusual dust disk rich in carbon, as well as two exoplanets (extrasolar planets). Another five stars in the constellation have been observed to have planets. Among them is HD 40307, an orange dwarf that has six planets orbiting it, one of which—HD 40307 g—is a potential super-Earth in the circumstellar habitable zone. Kapteyn&#x27;s Star, the nearest star in Pictor to Earth, is a red dwarf located 12.76 light-years away that was believed to have two super-Earths in orbit in 2014, but their existence of these planets was disproven in 2021. Pictor A is a radio galaxy that is shooting an 800,000 light-year long jet of plasma from a supermassive black hole at its centre. In 2006, a gamma-ray burst—GRB 060729—was observed in Pictor, its extremely long X-ray afterglow detectable for nearly two years.

==History==

The French astronomer Abbé Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille first described Pictor as &quot; le Chevalet et la Palette&quot; (the easel and palette) in 1756, after observing and cataloguing 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the Cape of Good Hope. He devised 14 new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. All but one honored instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. He gave these constellations Bayer designations, including ten stars in Pictor now named Alpha to Nu Pictoris. He labelled the constellation Equuleus Pictorius on his 1763 chart, the word &quot;Equuleus&quot; meaning small horse, or easel—perhaps from an old custom among artists of carrying a canvas on a donkey. The German astronomer Johann Bode called it Pluteum Pictoris. The name was shortened to its current form in 1845 by the English astronomer Francis Baily on the suggestion of his countryman Sir John Herschel.

==Characteristics==
Pictor is a small constellation bordered by Columba to the north, Puppis and Carina to the east, Caelum to the northwest, Dorado to the southwest and Volans to the south. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;Pic&quot;. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 18 segments (&quot;illustrated in infobox&quot;). In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between −42.79° and −64.15°. Pictor culminates each year at 9 p.m. on 17 March. Its position in the far Southern Celestial Hemisphere means that the whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude 26°N, and parts become circumpolar south of latitude 35°S.

==Features==

===Stars===

Pictor is a faint constellation; its three brightest stars can be seen near the prominent Canopus. Within the constellation&#x27;s borders, there are 49 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6.5. At apparent magnitude 3.3, Alpha Pictoris is the brightest star in the constellation; it is an astrometric binary 97 light-years from Earth. The primary of this system is an A-type star of spectral type A8VnkA6, a rapidly spinning star with a projected rotational velocity estimated at 206 km/s with has a shell of circumstellar gas. Beta Pictoris is another white main sequence star of spectral type A6V and apparent magnitude 3.86. Located around 63.4 light-years distant from Earth, it is a member of the Beta Pictoris moving group—a group of 17 star systems around 12 million years old moving through space together. In 1984 Beta Pictoris was the first star discovered to have a debris disk. Since then, two exoplanets with masses over ten times the mass of Jupiter have been discovered orbiting between 2.7 and eight astronomical units (AU) away from the star, which fit between the asteroid belt and the orbit of Saturn. Beta Pictoris b was discovered using direct imagery with the Very Large Telescope in late 2009, while Beta Pictoris c was discovered via doppler spectroscopy (radial velocity method) in August 2009.

Gamma Pictoris is an orange giant of spectral type K1III that has swollen to 11 times the diameter of the Sun. Shining with an apparent magnitude of 4.5, it lies 186 light-years distant from Earth. HD 42540, called 47 Pictoris by American astronomer Benjamin Apthorp Gould, is a slightly cooler orange giant, with a spectral type of K2.5III and average magnitude 5.04. It has also been suspected of being a variable star. Lacaille mistakenly named this star Mu Doradus, but had recorded its Right Ascension one hour too low. Lacaille named two neighbouring stars Eta Pictoris. Eta2 Pictoris, also known as HR 1663, is an orange giant of spectral type K5III and apparent magnitude 5.05. 474 light-years distant, it has a diameter 5.6 times that of the Sun. Eta1 Pictoris, also known as HR 1649, is 85 light-years distant and is a main sequence star of spectral type F5V and visual magnitude 5.38. A double star, it has a companion of magnitude 13; the two are separated by 11 arcseconds.

Located about 1298 light-years from Earth, Delta Pictoris is an eclipsing binary of the Beta Lyrae type. Composed of two blue stars of spectral types B3III and O9V, the system has a period of 1.67 days, and is observed to dip from apparent magnitude 4.65 to 4.9. The stars are oval-shaped as they are gravitationally distorted by each other. TV Pictoris is a spectroscopic binary system composed of an A-type star and an F-type star which rotate around each other in a very close orbit. The latter star is elliptical in shape and itself varies in brightness. The visual magnitude ranges between 7.37 and 7.53 every 20 hours.

Aside from Beta, five other stars in Pictor are known to host planetary systems. AB Pictoris is a BY Draconis variable star with a substellar companion that is either a large planet or a brown dwarf, which was discovered by direct imaging in 2005. HD 40307 is an orange main sequence star of spectral type K2.5V and apparent magnitude 7.17 located about 42 light-years away. Doppler spectroscopy with the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) indicates that HD 40307 is host to six super-Earth planets, one of which, HD 40307 g, lies in the circumstellar habitable zone of the star, and is not close enough to be tidally locked (i.e. with the same face always facing the star), unlike the other planets in the same system, and many other planets which orbit close to their parent stars. HD 41004 is a complex binary system about 139 light-years distant. The primary is an orange dwarf of spectral type K1V orbited by a planet roughly 2.65 times the mass of Jupiter every 963 days, while the secondary is a red dwarf of spectral type M2V and orbited by a brown dwarf that is at least 19 times as massive as Jupiter. Both substellar components were discovered by doppler spectroscopy using the CORALIE spectrograph in 2004 and 2002 respectively. Kapteyn&#x27;s Star, a nearby red dwarf at the distance of 12.78 light-years, has a magnitude of 8.8. It has the largest proper motion of any star in the sky after Barnard&#x27;s Star. Moving around the Milky Way in the opposite direction to most other stars, it may have originated in a dwarf galaxy that was merged into the Milky Way, with the main remnant being the Omega Centauri globular cluster. In 2014 analysis of the doppler variations of Kapteyn&#x27;s Star with the HARPS spectrograph showed that it hosts two super-Earths—Kapteyn b and Kapteyn c, but the existence of these exoplanet was disproven in 2021. It is believed that these planets were actually just artifacts of the Kapteyn&#x27; star&#x27;s rotation and activity.

Located 1.5 degrees west southwest of Alpha, RR Pictoris is a cataclysmic variable that flared up as a nova, reaching magnitude 1.2 on 9 June 1925. Six months after its peak brightness, it had faded to be invisible to the unaided eye, and was magnitude 12.5 by 1975. RR Pictoris is a close binary system composed of a white dwarf and secondary star that orbit each other every 3.48 hours—so close that the secondary is filling up its Roche lobe with stellar material, which is then transferred onto the first star&#x27;s accretion disk. Once this material reaches a critical mass, it ignites and the system brightens tremendously. Calculations from the orbital speed suggest the secondary star is not dense enough for its size to still be on the main sequence, so it also must have begun expanding and cooling already after its core ran out of hydrogen fuel. The RR Pictoris system is estimated to lie around 1300 light-years distant from Earth.

===Deep-sky objects===

NGC 1705 is an irregular dwarf galaxy 17 million light-years from Earth. It is one of the most active star forming galaxies in the nearby universe, despite the fact that its rate of star formation peaked around 30 million years ago. Pictor A, around 485 million light-years away, is a double-lobed radio galaxy and a powerful source of radio waves in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere. From a supermassive black hole at its centre, a relativistic jet shoots out to an X-ray hot spot 800,000 light years away. SPT-CL J0546-5345 is a massive galaxy cluster located around 7 billion light-years away with a mass equivalent to approximately 800 trillion suns.

GRB 060729 was a gamma-ray burst that was first observed on 29 July 2006. It is likely the signal of a type Ic supernova—the core collapse of a massive star. It was also notable for its extraordinarily long X-ray afterglow, detectable 642 days (nearly two years) after the original event. The event was remote, with a redshift of 0.54.

<doc id="211821" wikidata="Q10430" url="?curid=211821" title="Lacerta">
<text>Lacerta is one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union. Its name is Latin for lizard. A small, faint constellation, it was defined in 1687 by the astronomer Johannes Hevelius. Its brightest stars form a &quot;W&quot; shape similar to that of Cassiopeia, and it is thus sometimes referred to as &#x27;Little Cassiopeia&#x27;. It is located between Cygnus, Cassiopeia and Andromeda on the northern celestial sphere. The northern part lies on the Milky Way.

==Notable features==

Lacerta is typical of Milky Way constellations: no bright galaxies, nor globular clusters, but instead open clusters, for example NGC 7243, the faint planetary nebula IC 5217 and quite a few double stars. It also contains the prototypic blazar BL Lacertae.
Lacerta contains no Messier objects.

===Stars===

Alpha Lacertae is a blue-white hued main-sequence star of magnitude 3.8, 102 light-years from Earth. It has a spectral type of A1 V and is an optical double star. Beta Lacertae is far dimmer, a yellow giant of magnitude 4.4, 170 light-years from Earth.

Roe 47 is a multiple star consisting of five components (magnitudes 5.8, 9.8, 10.1, 9.4, 9.8).

ADS 16402 is a binary star system in Lacerta, around which a planet orbits with some unusual properties. The Jupiter-sized planet exhibits an unexpectedly low density, about the same as cork. This planet is dubbed HAT P-1.

EV Lacertae is a rapidly spinning magnitude 10 red dwarf with a strong magnetic field. It is a flare star that can emit powerful flares potentially visible to the naked eye, thousands of times more energetic than any from Earth&#x27;s sun.

HD 215441 (22h 44m.2 / +55° 35&#x27;) is known as Babcock&#x27;s Magnetic Star. Source: &quot;Sky Catalogue 2000.0 Volume 2: Double Stars, Variable Stars and Nonstellar Objects&quot;, page xlv, chapter &quot;Glossary of Selected Astronomical Names&quot;.

===Deep-sky objects===
NGC 7243 is an open cluster 2500 light-years from Earth, visible in small amateur telescopes. It has a few dozen &quot;scattered&quot; stars, the brightest of which are of the 8th magnitude.

BL Lacertae is the prototype of the BL Lacertae objects, which appear to be dim variable stars but are actually the variable nuclei of elliptical galaxies; they are similar to quasars. It lent its name to a whole type of celestial objects, the BL Lacertae objects (a subtype of blazar). The object varies irregularly between magnitudes 14 and 17 over a few days.

==History==

Centred on a region of the sky without apparently bright stars, Lacerta was apparently not regarded as a constellation by ancient Western astronomers. Johannes Hevelius created the constellation in 1687 and initially named it &quot;Stellio&quot; (the stellion), a lizard with star-like dorsal spots found along the Mediterranean coast.

Other Europeans who sought to name this new constellation included Augustin Royer, who created Sceptrum et Manus Iustitiae (the Hand of Justice and Sceptre) to honor Louis XIV in 1670, and Johann Elert Bode, who created Frederici Honores (Frederick&#x27;s Glory) to honor Frederick the Great in 1787. Both Sceptrum and Frederici Honores are now obsolete, while Lacerta still survives.

==Equivalents==
Although not included in ancient star charts of Europe and the Near East, the stars of Lacerta, along with some in the eastern portion of Cygnus, were coincidentally combined by early Chinese astronomers into their &quot;Flying serpent&quot;. Similarly, the Chumash people of California call this part of the sky &#x27;Lizard&#x27; and include it in multiple stories.

==Namesakes==
USS Lacerta (AKA-29) was an attack cargo ship in the United States navy named after the constellation.

<text>Take It from Here (often referred to as TIFH, pronounced – and sometimes humorously spelt – &quot;TIFE&quot;) is a British radio comedy programme broadcast on the BBC Light Programme between 1948 and 1960. It was written by Frank Muir and Denis Norden, and starred Jimmy Edwards, Dick Bentley and Joy Nichols. When Nichols moved to New York City in 1953, she was replaced by June Whitfield and Alma Cogan. The show is best remembered for introducing &quot;The Glums&quot;. Through &quot;TIFH&quot; Muir and Norden reinvented British post-war radio comedy – amongst other influences, it was one of the first shows with a significant segment consisting of parody of film and book styles, later used extensively in programmes such as &quot;Round the Horne&quot; and in many television comedy series.

==History==
===Genesis===
Frank Muir had been writing material for Jimmy Edwards&#x27;s appearances at the Windmill Theatre, and later wrote material for Edwards&#x27;s radio character, a seedy public school headmaster; Denis Norden had been staff comedy sketch writer with the Kavanagh agency, and had written material for the Australian comedian Dick Bentley. The radio producer Charles Maxwell had contracted Edwards, together with Joy Nichols and Dick Bentley, for the final series in 1947 of the radio show &quot;Navy Mixture&quot; for which Muir had provided some scripts, and after this show ended Maxwell received a commission for a new weekly comedy series to star Edwards, Nichols and Bentley. He introduced Muir to Norden, and asked them if they would collaborate to write the scripts.

The result was &quot;Take It from Here&quot; and the start of one of the most enduring comedy writing partnerships. Muir and Norden were to continue collaborating for nearly 50 years, writing such comic masterpieces as Peter Sellers&#x27; sketch &quot;Balham, Gateway to the South&quot;, and appearing together on radio panel games &quot;My Word!&quot; and &quot;My Music&quot;.

===Early years===
The first series of &quot;TIFH&quot;, broadcast in 1948, was set in a commercial radio station office. Although this first series was not a roaring success, Maxwell persuaded the management to persevere for one more series.

In the second series, Muir and Norden changed to a three-act format. Firstly there was a topical discussion, followed by music from &quot;The Keynotes&quot; close harmony group. Then came what Muir termed a &quot;gimmick&quot;, which might be &quot;Hamlet&quot; done as a pantomime, or an operatic weather forecast. Finally, after another song from Nichols or Bentley, there was a situation comedy sketch worked up from the clichés of a literary or cinematic genre; for example, later &quot;TIFH&quot; programmes included a sketch about restoration England, with Charles II, Nell Gwyn and the Puritan keeper of the Privy Purse (&quot;anything TV can do, we can do &quot;later&quot;&quot;); or a spoof spy story set on an international sleeper from London to Paris (&quot;…as I moved through the train I gazed at a handsome film star, slumbering in his compartment, and a thought struck me – whether you&#x27;re great or whether you&#x27;re humble, when you sleep upright you dribble&quot;). In addition, the character actor Wallas Eaton was engaged to play minor male roles, replacing Clarence Wright from the first series.

The main announcer throughout the programme&#x27;s run was David Dunhill, known as &quot;Dunners&quot;, although other staff announcers took his place on occasion, famously including Brian Matthew, later to become a mainstay of Light Programme and Radio 2 music programmes.

In 1953 Joy Nichols married an American, and settled in New York City in the hope of becoming a success in Broadway theatre. Because she had been engaged both as singer and actress, she was replaced by Alma Cogan the singer, and June Whitfield the actress (Prunella Scales was also considered as a replacement).

For the first episode of the next series, the &quot;TIFH&quot; Talking Point segment featured a parody of the sagas of &#x27;nice&#x27; families such as those eponymously named in &quot;The Archers&quot; or &quot;Life With The Lyons&quot; that abounded on the BBC at the time. This introduced an uncouth dysfunctional family called the Glums, with Mr Glum the archetypal chauvinist pig.

===The Glums===
First appearing on TIFH on 12 November 1953, the popularity of this sketch made Muir and Norden realise that they were on to something. They made one or two modifications to the characters, and &quot;The Glums&quot; became a regular part of &quot;Take It from Here&quot;.

The premise of &quot;The Glums&quot; was the long engagement between Ron Glum and his long-term fiancée Eth. As a result of post-war austerity, long engagements were common in 1950s Britain. A typical episode would start in the pub, with Mr Glum (played by Jimmy Edwards) talking to the barman (played by Wallas Eaton). It would be closing time, and Mr Glum would start telling the week&#x27;s story to the barman as a ruse for obtaining another pint (or two) of &quot;brahn&quot; (brown ale). The story would be about some recent episode in the lives of Ron, Mr Glum&#x27;s dim son (played by Dick Bentley), and Eth, a plain girl for whom Ron represented her only chance of marriage, played by June Whitfield. Bentley, who played the son, was almost thirteen years older than Edwards, who played the father.

A short signature tune would herald a change of scene to the Glums&#x27; front room, where Ron and Eth would be sitting on the sofa. Eth would say, &quot;Oh, Ron…!&quot; – her catchphrase – and Ron would vacantly reply something like, &quot;Yes, Eth?&quot; and the week&#x27;s story would begin in earnest. This opening formula was constantly varied slightly. For instance, in one episode, Eth says, &quot;Oh, Ron, is there anything on your mind, beloved?&quot;, to which Ron, after a pause, replies, &quot;No, Eth.&quot; Another example has Eth saying &quot;Oh really, Ron, do you expect me to just sit here, like a lemon?&quot;, to which Ron responds &quot;No thanks Eth, I&#x27;ve just had a banana.&quot;

Most weeks, after scene-setting comedy business between Ron and Eth, Eth would say something like, &quot;Sometimes, Ron, you&#x27;re so placid – I just wish you would have a little &quot;go&quot;!&quot; which Ron would stupidly misinterpret as an invitation to a kiss and cuddle. Eth would resist, and Ron and Eth&#x27;s grappling would be speedily interrupted by the entrance of Mr Glum with an &quot;&#x27;Ullo, &#x27;ullo!&quot; and something like &quot;All in wrestling – break clean!&quot; or &quot;Sorry to interrupt, but have you seen the garden shears? Mrs Glum wants to do her eyebrows.&quot;

The story usually involved some crisis in the relationship of the three protagonists. In several episodes this crisis followed from Ron&#x27;s laziness, and his resultant inability to find employment. Some weeks it would be due to Mr Glum&#x27;s refusal to let Ron and Eth marry (in one episode this is because he is not sure that Ron really loves Eth, in another Eth takes Mr Glum to court because he will not give his consent to the marriage). One story was about Eth getting into difficulties because she was accused of pilfering at the office where she was a secretary. Very often, the story arose from the consequences of some idiotic behaviour on the part of Ron, who was incapable of competently carrying out any simple task, even going to the fish-and-chip shop (in which instance he put his change up his nose).

Another character, who never appears but who is sometimes to be heard incoherently behind the scenes, was Mrs Glum, the family matriarch (Alma Cogan, the singer, usually provided Ma Glum&#x27;s off-stage noises). Although she never had a speaking part, Ma Glum provided comedy value by always being put upon by Mr Glum, and yet always getting her way (such as the episode where Mr Glum pawned her false teeth). Alma Cogan also played other sundry feminine parts, such as occasional extramarital romantic interest for Mr Glum.

===Final year===
In 1959, Muir and Norden decided to move into writing for television, and so stopped writing &quot;TIFH&quot;. The BBC brought in writers Barry Took and Eric Merriman for the 1959-1960 series, but this was to be &quot;Take It from Here&quot;″s last.

==Influence==
The parody sketch, previously used in stage revues but brought to radio by Muir and Norden for &quot;Take It from Here&quot;, was very influential on comedy shows such as &quot;Round the Horne&quot; and many television programmes.

In one of the parody sketches, a take-off of the films of English north country factory owners, Muir claimed that they introduced the phrase &quot;Trouble at t&#x27;Mill&quot;. For one series, Wallas Eaton portrayed an opinionated newspaper letter writer named &quot;Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells&quot;, another phrase that entered the language.

Many of the jokes and comic exchanges from &quot;Take It from Here&quot; were recycled in the series of &quot;Carry On&quot; films when scriptwriter Talbot Rothwell ran out of time, and Muir and Norden gave him some old &quot;TIFH&quot; scripts – for instance, the line spoken by Julius Caesar (played by Kenneth Williams) in &quot;Carry on Cleo&quot; on facing some would-be assassins: &quot;Infamy! Infamy! They&#x27;ve all got it in for me!&quot;

While the humour was undoubtedly parochially British, in his autobiography Frank Muir expressed gratification and wonder that the show was so well received in Australia – where &quot;TIFH&quot;″s subtlety, and the show&#x27;s implied confidence in the listeners&#x27; level of intelligence, were commented on in the Australian press as characteristics one would have expected to lead to the show&#x27;s failure there!

In the 1970s, the Oslo-based radio network NRK produced and transmitted a Norwegian-language version of &quot;Take It from Here&quot; under the title &quot;Familien Glum&quot;.

==Television revival of &quot;The Glums&quot;==
&quot;The Glums&quot; were remembered sufficiently for the format to be revived in 1978 as part of the unsuccessful &quot;Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s Big Night&quot; programme. A single stand alone series of &quot;The Glums&quot; was produced and broadcast the following year (consisting of eight episodes) by London Weekend Television, usually drawing on two original radio scripts each week. Ron Glum was played by Ian Lavender and Eth by Patricia Brake, while Jimmy Edwards reprised the role of Pa Glum.

A Region 2 DVD of both the &quot;Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s Big Night&quot; shorts and the subsequent 1979 series was commercially released in 2011 in the UK.

<doc id="211823" wikidata="Q217704" url="?curid=211823" title="Ibisbill">
<text>The ibisbill (Ibidorhyncha struthersii) is a bird related to the waders, but sufficiently distinctive to merit its own family Ibidorhynchidae. It is grey with a white belly, red legs and long down-curved bill, and a black face and black breast band. It occurs on the shingle riverbanks of the high plateau of central Asia and the Himalayas.

== Taxonomy ==
The ibisbill belongs to the order Charadriiformes which also includes the sandpipers, plovers, terns, auks, gulls, skuas and others. Although its evolutionary relationships are not fully understood, the ibisbill appears to be most closely related to a group including the oystercatchers, avocets, stilts and &quot;Pluvialis&quot; plovers, but sufficiently distinctive to merit its own family, Ibidorhynchidae. 

There are no subspecies. The species was described in 1831 by Vigors based on painting by John Gould although Brian Hodgson had sent a manuscript to the Asiatic Society of Bengal two years earlier describing it as the &quot;Red-billed Erolia&quot; but this was published only in 1835 with an apology from the editor. Hodgson later suggested a new genus name of &quot;Clorhynchus&quot; for the bird stating that Gould&#x27;s description of &quot;Ibidorhyncha&quot; was inaccurate while Vieillot&#x27;s &quot;Erolia&quot; had been rejected. The species is named in honour of Dr. Struthers who collected specimens of the bird from the Himalayas.

== Description ==

The ibisbill is long and is quite unmistakable in appearance. The adult is grey with a white belly, a crimson, long down-curved bill similar to that of the unrelated ibis, and a black face and black breast band. The sexes are similar, but young birds lack the black on the face and breast, and the bill is duller. The bill is long and is slightly longer in females. The legs are greyish purple in the breeding adults and dull sepia in juveniles or greenish in younger or non-breeding adults. The legs of deceased ibisbills change color to a crimson similar to the bill shade shortly after death. The tarsi is short and reticulated. The ibisbill has three toes, lacking the hind toe. The outer and middle toes are connected by a small, indented web, while the middle and inner toes possess no webbing. The Ibisbill typically weighs and females weigh slightly more than males. In spite of its spectacular appearance it is inconspicuous in its stony environment. The call is a ringing &quot;Klew-klew&quot; similar to that of a greenshank. In flight, its outstretched neck and rounded wings give an ibis-like appearance.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Ibisbills are common in Central Asia and the Himalayas, from Lake Issyk-Kul to the southern border of Manchuria, in Russia in the Altai. They also live in the highlands of the Central and Northern Tien Shan, within Kazakhstan along the valleys of the rivers Bolshaya and Malaya Almatinka, Chilik, Issyk, Karkara, Bayankol, Dzhungar Alatau, Choldysu. 

The ibisbill breeds across southern Central Asia along stony riverbeds, typically between , although there are records of the ibisbill breeding as low as . Outside the breeding season, it may descend as low as . It typically is found in shingle-bed river valleys from across with patches of sand and silt mixed in with pebbles and small boulders. The river valleys frequented by the ibisbill tend to have very little vegetation and gentle slopes to ensure a slow flow of water. It must live near slow-flowing water in order to feed, limiting its habitat despite a large range.

== Behaviour ==
During the autumn and winter, the ibisbill typically is solitary, though they can be found in pairs or in small flocks of up to eight birds. One group of 25 ibisbills has been reported. Ibisbills breed solitarily and are territorial, though limited habitat availability can cause ibisbills to breed while neighboring others. They are generally not shy of humans. They are good swimmers and prefer crossing rivers by swimming instead of flying.

Wintering birds tend to be fairly inactive, while they become more active and noisy as the breeding season approaches.

When scratching the feathers on their head with their toes, they reach from over the wings. This indirect approach pattern is also found in plovers and lapwings but not in stone-plovers and other waders that reach directly from under the wing.

=== Breeding ===

The ibisbill is apparently a monogamous breeder. During the breeding season, the ibisbill is known to run short distances while holding the head down, only standing upright to look at its surroundings. The nest is located on a bank, island or peninsula on the river, and is little more than a scrape on the ground, which may sometimes be lined with small pebbles. Eggs are laid in the end of April and the beginning of May (exact timing varies due to the weather). The clutch size varies from two to four oval eggs. The behaviour of adults near the nest are said to be similar to lapwings. The exact time taken to incubate the eggs is unknown, but both parents share incubation duties. It is suspected that chicks from the previous brood may act as helpers at the nest.

=== Feeding ===

The ibisbill feeds by probing under rocks or gravel on stream beds. It will take a variety of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates including caddisfly and mayfly larvae that hide under boulders in streams, grasshoppers and also small fish.

== Conservation status ==

This species has an extremely large range, estimated at 5 million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles) which is not believed to declining or fragmentating. Although its population is unknown, it is not thought to be declining. For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern by the IUCN.

<doc id="211825" wikidata="Q10435" url="?curid=211825" title="Musca">
<text>is a small constellation in the deep southern sky. It was one of 12 constellations created by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, and it first appeared on a celestial globe in diameter published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer&#x27;s &quot;Uranometria&quot; of 1603. It was also known as for 200 years. Musca remains below the horizon for most Northern Hemisphere observers.

Many of the constellation&#x27;s brighter stars are members of the Scorpius–Centaurus association, a loose group of hot blue-white stars that appears to share a common origin and motion across the Milky Way. These include Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Zeta2 and (probably) Eta Muscae, as well as HD 100546, a blue-white Herbig Ae/Be star that is surrounded by a complex debris disk containing a large planet or brown dwarf and possible protoplanet. Two further star systems have been found to have planets. The constellation also contains two cepheid variables visible to the naked eye. Theta Muscae is a triple star system, the brightest member of which is a Wolf–Rayet star.

== History ==

Musca was one of the 12 constellations established by the astronomer Petrus Plancius from the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the &quot;Eerste Schipvaart&quot;, to the East Indies. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue in 1598 under the Dutch name &quot;De Vlieghe&quot;, &quot;The Fly&quot;. They assigned four stars to the constellation, with a star that would be later designated as Beta Muscae marking the head, Gamma the body, and Alpha and Delta the left and right wings, respectively. It first appeared on a 35-cm-diameter (14-in) celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius, though was unnamed. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in the German cartographer Johann Bayer&#x27;s &quot;Uranometria&quot; of 1603, though Bayer termed it Apis— &quot;the Bee&quot;, a name by which it was known for the next two centuries. A 1603 celestial globe by Willem Blaeu depicts it as providing nourishment for the nearby constellation Chamaeleon—its tongue trying to catch the insect.

The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille called it &quot;la Mouche&quot; on the 1756 version of his planisphere of the southern skies. Jean Fortin retained the French name in 1776 for his &quot;Atlas Céleste&quot;, while Lacaille latinised the name for his revised &quot;Coelum Australe Stelliferum&quot; in 1763. Lacaille renamed it to &quot;Musca Australis&quot;, the Southern Fly—&quot;Australis&quot;, since it counterparted the now discarded constellation of Musca Borealis composed of a few stars in Aries, and to avoid confusion with Apus. Today, the name is simply Musca. It is the only official constellation depicting an insect.

The Kalapalo people of Mato Grosso state in Brazil called Alpha and Beta Muscae (along with Beta and Kappa Crucis) &quot;Kutsu anangagï&quot; &quot;Ornate Hawk-Eagle&#x27;s double flutes&quot;. The Wardaman people of the Northern Territory in Australia perceived the main stars of Musca as a ceremonial boomerang, part of the Central Arena—a sacred area surrounding the constellation Crux that depicts the lightning creation beings and where they teach Wardaman customs; Alpha and Beta also signified a ceremonial headband, while Gamma and Delta represented two armbands. In central Australia, the Arrernte and Luritja peoples living in on a mission in Hermannsburg viewed the sky as divided between them, east of the Milky Way representing Arrernte camps and west denoting Luritja camps. The stars of Musca, along with Fomalhaut, Alpha Pavonis, and Alpha and Beta Gruis, were all claimed by the Arrernte.

==Characteristics==
Musca is bordered by Crux to the north, Carina to the west, Chamaeleon to the south, Apus and Circinus to the east, and Centaurus to the northeast. Covering 138 square degrees and 0.335% of the night sky, it ranks 77th of the 88 constellations in size. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;Mus&quot;. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of six segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between −64.64° and −75.68°. The whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude 14°N.

== Features ==

===Stars===
Lacaille charted and designated 10 stars with the Bayer designations Alpha to Kappa in 1756. He catalogued stars that became Lambda and Mu, but did not designate them as he considered them &quot;informes&quot; as they lay outside the asterism proper. Francis Baily considered them part of Musca, and Gould gave them their Bayer designations. Baily also dropped Kappa, which he felt was too faint to warrant a name, and designated two adjacent stars as Zeta1 and Zeta2. These last two stars are 1° apart, quite far to be sharing a Bayer designation. Lacaille had originally labelled the fainter one as Zeta, while Baily presupposed he had meant to label the brighter one. Reluctant to remove Lacaille&#x27;s designation, he gave them both the Zeta designation. Altogether there are 62 stars brighter than magnitude 6.5 in the constellation.

The pattern of the brightest stars resembles that of Ursa Minor, in that the stars form a pattern reminiscent of a bowl with a handle. Lying south-southeast of Acrux in neighbouring Crux is Alpha Muscae. It is the brightest star in the constellation with an apparent magnitude of 2.7. Lying around 310 light-years away, it is a blue-white star of spectral type B2IV-V that is around 4520 times as luminous and 8 times as massive as the Sun. The star is a Beta Cephei variable with about 4.7 times the Sun&#x27;s diameter, and pulsates every 2.2 hours, varying by 1% in brightness. A nearby star of magnitude 13 may or may not be a companion star. Marking the fly&#x27;s tail is Gamma Muscae, a blue-white star of spectral type B5V that varies between magnitudes 3.84 and 3.86 over a period of 2.7 days. It is a variable of a different type, classed as a slowly pulsating B star, a type of variable. It is around five times as massive as the Sun.

Beta Muscae is a binary star system around 341 light-years distant that is composed of two blue-white main-sequence stars of spectral types B2V and B3V that orbit each other every 194 years. They are eight and six times as massive as the Sun, respectively, and have about 3.5 times its diameter. Zeta2 Muscae is a white main sequence star of spectral type A5V around 330 light-years distant from Earth. It is part of a triple star system with faint companions at 0.5 and 32.4 arc seconds distance. Eta Muscae is a multiple star system, the two main components forming an eclipsing binary that has a combined spectral type of B8V and magnitude of 4.77 that dips by 0.05 magnitude every 2.39 days. Alpha, Beta, Gamma, HD 103079, Zeta2 and (likely) Eta are all members of the Lower Centaurus Crux subgroup of the Scorpius–Centaurus association, a group of predominantly hot blue-white stars that share a common origin and proper motion across the galaxy.

Delta and Epsilon mark the fly&#x27;s left wing and right wing, respectively. With an apparent magnitude of 3.62, Delta is an orange giant of spectral type K2III located around 91 light-years away. Epsilon Muscae is a red giant of spectral type M5III and semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 3.99 and 4.31 over approximately 40 days. It has expanded to 130 times the Sun&#x27;s diameter and 1800 to 2300 its luminosity. It was a star originally 1.5 to 2 times as massive as the Sun. Although of a similar distance—around 302 light-years—to the stars of the Lower Centaurus Crux subgroup, it is moving much faster at around 100 km/s and does not share a common origin. To the northwest lies Mu Muscae, an orange giant of spectral type K4III that varies between apparent magnitude 4.71 and 4.76, and has been classified as a slow, irregular variable. Near Mu is Lambda Muscae, the third-brightest star in the constellation and a white main-sequence star of spectral type A7V around 128 light-years distant from Earth.

Located near Alpha is R Muscae, a classical Cepheid variable ranging from apparent magnitude 5.93 to 6.73 over 7.5 days. It is a yellow-white supergiant ranging between spectral types F7Ib and G2Ib, located around 2037 light-years away. S Muscae is likewise a classical Cepheid, a yellow-white supergiant ranging between spectral types F6Ib and G0Ib and magnitudes 5.89 to 6.49 over a period of 9.66 days. A luminous star around 5.9 times as massive as the Sun, it is a binary star with a blue-white main-sequence star companion likely to be of spectral type B3V to B5V with a mass of just over 5 solar masses, one of the hottest and brightest companions of a cepheid known. The two stars orbit each other every 505 days.

Theta Muscae is a triple star system thought to be around 7,500 light-years distant. It consists of a spectroscopic binary system composed of the Wolf–Rayet star (spectral type: WC5 or 6) and an O-type main-sequence star (spectral type: O6 or O7) that orbit each other every 19 days and a blue supergiant (spectral type: O9.5/B0Iab) set about 46 milliarcseconds apart from them. If the system&#x27;s estimated distance from Earth is accurate, the binary stars are about 0.5 astronomical units (AU) apart and the supergiant about 100 AU apart from them. All three are highly luminous; combined, they are likely to be over a million times as luminous as the Sun. TU Muscae is a binary star system located around 15,500 light-years away made up of two hot, luminous, blue main-sequence stars of spectral types O7.5V and O9.5V, with masses 23 and 15 times that of the Sun. The stars are so close that they are in contact with each other (overcontact binary) and are classed as a Beta Lyrae variable as their light varies from Earth as they eclipse each other. The system ranges from apparent magnitude 8.17 to 8.75 over around 1.4 days.

Also known as Nova Muscae 1983, GQ Muscae is a binary system consisting of a white dwarf and small star that is about 10% as massive as the Sun. The two orbit each other every 1.4 hours. The white dwarf accumulates material from its companion star via its accretion disc. After a certain amount has accumulated, the star erupts, as it did in 1983, reaching a magnitude of 7.2. Discovered with a magnitude of 7.1 on 18 January 1983, it was the first nova from which X-rays were detected. The soft X-ray transient GRS 1124-683 (also known as Nova Muscae 1991) is a binary object consisting of an orange main-sequence star (GU Muscae) of spectral type K3V–K4V and a black hole of around six solar masses. During the 1991 outburst which led to its discovery, radiation was produced through a process of positron annihilation. GR Muscae is an X-ray source composed of a neutron star of between 1.2 and 1.8 times the mass of the Sun and a low-mass star likely to be around the mass of the Sun in close orbit. Finally, SY Muscae is a symbiotic star system composed of a red giant and white dwarf, where although the larger star is transferring mass to the smaller, no periodic eruption occurs nor does an accretion disc form. The star system varies in magnitude from 10.2 to 12.7 over a period of 624.5 days. V415 Muscae is a nova that had an outburst in 8 June 2022 with an apparent magnitude of +8.7.

Three star systems have been discovered to have exoplanets. HD 111232 is a yellow main-sequence star around 78% as massive as the Sun around 95 light-years distant. It has a planet (HD 111232 b) around 6.8 times the mass of Jupiter that has an orbital period around 1143 days. HD 112410 is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III located around 439 light-years distant. With around 1.54 times the mass of the Sun, it is cooling and expanding along the red-giant branch, having left the main sequence after exhausting its core supply of hydrogen fuel. It has a substellar companion calculated to have a mass 9.2 times that of Jupiter and an orbital period of 124.6 days at a distance around 0.57 AU. Yet another member of the Lower Centaurus Crux subgroup, HD 100546 is a young, blue-white Herbig Ae/Be star of spectral type B9V that has yet to settle on the main sequence—the closest of these stars to Earth around 320 light-years distant. It is surrounded by a circumstellar debris disk from a distance of 0.2 to 4 AU, and again from 13 AU out to a few hundred AU, with evidence for a protoplanet forming at a distance around 47 AU. A gap exists between 4 and 13 AU, which appears to contain a large planet around 20 times the mass of Jupiter, although further examination of the disk profile indicates it might be a more massive object such as a brown dwarf or more than one planet. LP 145-141 is a white dwarf located 15 light-years distant—the fourth-closest to the Solar System. It is considered a good candidate to look for Jupiter-like planets, on account if its proximity and mass.

===Deep-sky objects===
Located on the border with Circinus is the unusual planetary nebula NGC 5189, estimated to be around 1750 light-years away from Earth. Its complex structure is due to multiple ejections of material from the ageing central star, which are distorted by the presence of a likely binary companion. Located 2.4° east of Eta Muscae is the magnitude-12.9 Engraved Hourglass Nebula (MyCn 18), which lies about 8000 light-years distant from Earth. To Eta&#x27;s west lies IC 4191, a compact bluish planetary nebula of magnitude 10.6, thought to lie around 10,750 light-years away from Earth. West of Epsilon Muscae is NGC 4071, a large, diffuse planetary nebula of magnitude 12.7 with a magnitude 12 central star, thought to lie around 4000 light-years away from Earth. The Coalsack Nebula is a dark nebula located mainly in neighbouring Crux that intrudes into Musca. NGC 4463 is an open cluster located on its southwestern border. Around five light-years across, it is located around 3400 light-years away.

The comparatively old globular cluster NGC 4833 near Delta Muscae was catalogued by Lacaille in 1755. It is 21,200 light-years distant and somewhat obscured by dust clouds near the galactic plane. The globular cluster NGC 4372 near Gamma Muscae is fainter and likewise partially obscured by dust, but spans more arc minutes. It is 18,900 light-years away from Earth and 23,000 light-years distant from the centre of the Milky Way. Its extremely low metallicity indicates it is very old—one of the oldest clusters in the Milky Way. Extending south from it is the Dark Doodad Nebula, resembling a dark L-shaped river through a bright field of stars. Another dark nebula in the constellation is BHR 71.

<doc id="211826" wikidata="Q10403" url="?curid=211826" title="Leo Minor">
<text>Leo Minor is a small and faint constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere. Its name is Latin for &quot;the smaller lion&quot;, in contrast to Leo, the larger lion. It lies between the larger and more recognizable Ursa Major to the north and Leo to the south. Leo Minor was not regarded as a separate constellation by classical astronomers; it was designated by Johannes Hevelius in 1687.

There are 37 stars brighter than apparent magnitude 6.5 in the constellation; three are brighter than magnitude 4.5. 46 Leonis Minoris, an orange giant of magnitude 3.8, is located some 95 light-years from Earth. At magnitude 4.4, Beta Leonis Minoris is the second-brightest star and the only one in the constellation with a Bayer designation. It is a binary star, the brighter component of which is an orange giant and the fainter a yellow-white main sequence star. The third-brightest star is 21 Leonis Minoris, a rapidly rotating white main-sequence star of average magnitude 4.5. The constellation also includes two stars with planetary systems, two pairs of interacting galaxies, and Hanny&#x27;s Voorwerp, a unique deep-sky object.

==History==
The classical astronomers Aratus and Ptolemy had noted the region of what is now Leo Minor to be undefined and not containing any distinctive patterns; Ptolemy classified the stars in this area as &quot;amorphōtoi&quot; (not belonging to a constellation outline) within the constellation Leo.

Johannes Hevelius first depicted Leo Minor in 1687 when he outlined ten new constellations in his star atlas &quot;Firmamentum Sobiescianum&quot;, and included 18 of its objects in the accompanying &quot;Catalogus Stellarum Fixarum&quot;. Hevelius decided upon Leo Minor or Leo Junior as a depiction that would align with its beastly neighbours the Lion and the Great Bear. In 1845, English astronomer Francis Baily revised the catalogue of Hevelius&#x27;s new constellations, and assigned a Greek letter known as Bayer designation to stars brighter than apparent magnitude 4.5. Richard A. Proctor gave the constellation the name &quot;Leaena&quot; &quot;the Lioness&quot; in 1870, explaining that he sought to shorten the constellation names to make them more manageable on celestial charts.

German astronomer Christian Ludwig Ideler posited that the stars of Leo Minor had been termed &quot;Al Thibā&#x27; wa-Aulāduhā&quot; &quot;Gazelle with her Young&quot; on a 13th-century Arabic celestial globe, recovered by Cardinal Stefano Borgia and housed in the prelate&#x27;s museum at Velletri. Arabist Friedrich Wilhelm Lach describes a different view, noting that they had been seen as &quot;Al Haud&quot; &quot;the Pond&quot;, which the Gazelle jumps into. In Chinese astronomy, the stars Beta, 30, 37 and 46 Leonis Minoris made up &quot;Neiping&quot;, a &quot;Court of Judge or Mediator&quot;, or &quot;Shi&quot; &quot;Court Eunuch&quot; or were combined with stars of the neighbouring Leo to make up a large celestial dragon or State Chariot. A line of four stars was known as &quot;Shaowei&quot;; it represented four Imperial advisors and may have been located in Leo Minor, Leo or adjacent regions.

==Characteristics==
A dark area of the sky with a triangle of brighter stars just visible to the naked eye in good conditions, Leo Minor has been described by Patrick Moore as having &quot;dubious claims to a separate identity&quot;. It is a small constellation bordered by Ursa Major to the north, Lynx to the west, Leo to the south, and touching the corner of Cancer to the southwest. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;LMi&quot;. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 16 sides. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between 22.84° and 41.43°. Ranked 64th out of 88 constellations in size, Leo Minor covers an area of 232.0 square degrees, or 0.562 per cent of the sky. It culminates each year at midnight on 24 February, and at 9 p.m. on 24 May.

==Notable features==

===Stars===

There are only three stars in the constellation brighter than magnitude 4.5, and 37 stars with a magnitude brighter than 6.5. Leo Minor does not have a star designated Alpha because Baily erred and allocated a Greek letter to only one star, Beta. It is unclear whether he intended to give 46 Leonis Minoris a Bayer designation, as he recognized Beta and 46 Leonis Minoris as of the appropriate brightness in his catalogue. He died before revising his proofs, which might explain this star&#x27;s omission.

At magnitude 3.8, the brightest star in Leo Minor is an orange giant of spectral class K0III named 46 Leonis Minoris or Praecipua; its colour is evident when seen through binoculars. Situated from Earth, it has around 32 times the luminosity and is 8.5 times the size of the Sun. It was also catalogued and named as o Leonis Minoris by Johann Elert Bode, which has been misinterpreted as Omicron Leonis Minoris. More confusion occurred with its proper name &quot;Praecipua&quot;, which appears to have been originally applied to 37 Leonis Minoris in the 1814 &quot;Palermo Catalogue&quot; of Giuseppe Piazzi, who mistakenly assessed the latter star as the brighter. This name was later connected by Allen with 46 Leonis Minoris—an error perpetuated by subsequent astronomers. The original &quot;Praecipua&quot;, 37 Leonis Minoris, has an apparent magnitude of 4.69, but is a distant yellow supergiant of spectral type G2.5IIa and absolute magnitude of −1.84, around distant.

Beta Leonis Minoris is a binary star system. The primary is a giant star of spectral class G9III and apparent magnitude of 4.4. It has around double the mass, 7.8 times the radius and 36 times the luminosity of the Earth&#x27;s Sun. Separated by 0.1 to 0.6 second of arc from the primary, the secondary is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F8. The two orbit around a common centre of gravity every 38.62 years, and lie away from the Solar System.

Around away and around 10 times as luminous as the Sun, 21 Leonis Minoris is a rapidly rotating white main-sequence star, spinning on its axis in less than 12 hours and very likely flattened in shape. Of average apparent magnitude 4.5 and spectral type A7V, it is a Delta Scuti variable. These are short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars which have been used as standard candles and as subjects to study asteroseismology.

Also known as SU and SV Leonis Minoris, 10 and 11 Leonis Minoris are yellow giants of spectral type G8III, with average magnitudes 4.54 and 5.34 respectively. Both are RS Canum Venaticorum variables, with 10 Leonis Minoris varying by 0.012 magnitude over 40.4 days, and 11 Leonis Minoris by 0.033 magnitude over 18 days. 11 Leonis Minoris has a red dwarf companion of spectral type M5V and apparent magnitude 13.0. 20 Leonis Minoris is a multiple star system away from the Sun. The main star is another yellow star, this time a dwarf of spectral type G3Va and apparent magnitude 5.4. The companion is an old, active red dwarf that has a relatively high metallicity and is of spectral type M6.5. The fact that the secondary star is brighter than expected indicates it is likely two stars very close together that are unable to be made out separately with current viewing technology.

R and S Leonis Minoris are long-period Mira variables, while U Leonis Minoris is a semiregular variable; all three are red giants of spectral types M6.5e-M9.0e, M5e and M6 respectively. R varies between magnitudes 6.3 and 13.2 during a period of 372 days, S varies between magnitudes 8.6 and 13.9 during a period of 234 days, and U varies between magnitudes 10.0 and 13.3 during a period of 272 days. The lack of bright stars makes finding these objects challenging for amateur astronomers. G 117-B15A, also known as RY Leonis Minoris, is a pulsating white dwarf of apparent magnitude 15.5. With a period of approximately 215 seconds, and losing a second every 8.9 million years, the 400-million-year-old star has been proposed as the most stable celestial clock.

SX Leonis Minoris is a dwarf nova of the SU Ursae Majoris type that was identified in 1994. It consists of a white dwarf and a donor star, which orbit each other every 97 minutes. The white dwarf sucks matter from the other star onto an accretion disc and heats up to between 6000 and 10000 K. The dwarf star erupts every 34 to 64 days, reaching magnitude 13.4 in these outbursts and remaining at magnitude 16.8 when quiet. Leo Minor contains another dwarf nova, RZ Leonis Minoris, which brightens to magnitude 14.2 from a baseline magnitude of around 17 but does so at shorter intervals than other dwarf novae.

Two stars with planetary systems have been found. HD 87883 is an orange dwarf of magnitude 7.57 and spectral type K0V 18 parsecs distant from Earth. With a diameter three quarters that of Earth&#x27;s sun, it is only 31 per cent as luminous. It is orbited by a planet around 1.78 times the mass of Jupiter every 7.9 years, and there are possibly other smaller planets. HD 82886 (Illyrian) is a yellow dwarf of spectral type G0 and visual magnitude 7.63. A planet 1.3 times the mass of Jupiter and orbiting every 705 days was discovered in 2011.

===Deep-sky objects===
In terms of deep-sky objects, Leo Minor contains many galaxies viewable in amateur telescopes. Located 3 degrees southeast of 38 Leonis Minoris, NGC 3432 is seen nearly edge on. It is of apparent magnitude 11.7 and measures 6.8 by 1.4 arcminutes. Located 42 million light-years away, it is moving away from the Solar System at a rate of 616 km per second. In 2000, a star within the galaxy brightened to magnitude 17.4, and has since been determined to be a luminous blue variable and supernova impostor. It has tidal filaments and intense star formation, so it was listed in Halton Arp&#x27;s Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies. NGC 3003, a SBbc barred spiral galaxy with an apparent magnitude of 12.3 and an angular size of 5.8 arcminutes, is seen almost edge-on. NGC 3344, 25 million light-years distant, is face-on towards Earth. Measuring 7.1 by 6.5 arcminutes in size, it has an apparent magnitude of 10.45. NGC 3504 is a starburst barred spiral galaxy of apparent magnitude 11.67 and measuring 2.1 by 2.7 arcminutes. It has hosted supernovae in 1998 and 2001. It and the spiral galaxy NGC 3486 are also almost face-on towards Earth; the latter is of magnitude 11.05 and measures 7.1 by 5.2 arcminutes. NGC 2859 is an SB0-type lenticular galaxy.

At least two pairs of interacting galaxies have been observed. Arp 107 is a pair of galaxies in the process of merging, located 450 million light-years away. NGC 3395 and NGC 3396 are a spiral and irregular barred spiral galaxy, respectively, that are interacting, located 1.33 degrees southwest of 46 Leonis Minoris.

The unique deep-sky object known as Hanny&#x27;s Voorwerp was discovered in Leo Minor in 2007 by Dutch school teacher Hanny van Arkel while participating as a volunteer in the Galaxy Zoo project. Lying near the 650-million-light-year-distant spiral galaxy IC 2497, it is around the same size as the Milky Way. It contains a 16,000-light-year-wide hole. The voorwerp is thought to be the visual light echo of a quasar now gone inactive, possibly as recently as 200,000 years ago.

===Meteor shower===
Discovered by Dick McCloskey and Annette Posen of the Harvard Meteor Program in 1959, the Leonis Minorid meteor shower peaks between 18 and 29 October. The shower&#x27;s parent body is the long period comet C/1739 K1 (Zanotti). It is a minor shower, and can only be seen from the Northern Hemisphere.
===In Popular Culture===
The fact that Leo Minor was not a named constellation until 1687 provided proof that an alleged play by Euripides was in fact a forgery, in the Inspector Lewis episode &quot;The Lions of Nemea&quot;.

<text>Yle Fem (&quot;Yle Five&quot;) was Yle&#x27;s Finland-Swedish national television channel, providing television programmes in the Swedish language in Finland. It was a public-service channel principally intended for Finland&#x27;s Swedish-speaking minority. Creating understanding over the language and culture border was also one of the channel&#x27;s recognized objectives.

==History==
Yle Fem was launched in 1988 as a late-evening programming block called FST (Finlands Svenska Television, literally &quot;Finland&#x27;s Swedish Television&quot;) which was broadcast on Monday nights on Yle TV2 and on Tuesday nights on Yle TV1, after the conclusion of MTV3&#x27;s Kymmenen Uutiset (10pm evening news) on either channel. It was relaunched as its own dedicated channel called YLE FST on 27 August 2001, and was called YLE FST5 from 2006 to 2012, but the name was changed because the viewers thought the name was only a combination of letters (Fem is Swedish for five.). Initially, Finlands Svenska Television&#x27;s output was formerly included in the programming of Yle&#x27;s two main television channels, TV1 and TV2. Yle Fem and Yle Teema were merged into one network on 24 April 2017, as Yle Teema &amp; Fem.

<text>Columba is a faint constellation designated in the late sixteenth century, remaining in official use, with its rigid limits set in the 20th century. Its name is Latin for dove. It takes up 1.31% of the southern celestial hemisphere and is just south of Canis Major and Lepus.

==History==

* Early 3rd century BC: Aratus&#x27;s astronomical poem &quot;Phainomena&quot; (lines 367–370 and 384–385) mentions faint stars where Columba is now but does not fit any name or figure to them.
* 2nd century AD: Ptolemy lists 48 constellations in the &quot;Almagest&quot;. While Columba is not yet among them, several stars south of Canis Major listed in this work will eventually become part of Columba.
* c. 150–215 AD: Clement of Alexandria wrote in his &quot;Logos Paidogogos&quot;&quot;Αἱ δὲ σφραγῖδες ἡμῖν ἔστων πελειὰς ἢ ἰχθὺς ἢ ναῦς οὐριοδρομοῦσα ἢ λύρα μουσική, ᾗ κέχρηται Πολυκράτης, ἢ ἄγκυρα ναυτική,&quot; (= &quot;[when recommending symbols for Christians to use], let our seals be a dove or a fish or a ship running in a good wind or a musical lyre ... or a ship&#x27;s anchor ...&quot;), with no mention of stars or astronomy.
* 1592 AD: Petrus Plancius first depicted Columba on the small celestial planispheres of his large wall map to differentiate the &#x27;unformed stars&#x27; of the large constellation Canis Major. Columba is also shown on his smaller world map of 1594 and on early Dutch celestial globes. Plancius named the constellation Columba Noachi (&quot;Noah&#x27;s Dove&quot;), referring to the dove that gave Noah the information that the Great Flood was receding. This name is found on early 17th-century celestial globes and star atlases.

* 1603: Frederick de Houtman listed Columba as &quot;De Duyve med den Olijftack&quot; (&quot;the dove with the olive branch&quot;)
* 1603: Bayer&#x27;s sky atlas Uranometria was published. It includes Columba as Columba Noachi.
* 1624: Bartschius listed Columba in his &quot;Usus Astronomicus&quot; as &quot;Columba Nohae&quot;.
* 1662: Caesius published &quot;Coelum Astronomico-Poeticum&quot;, including an inaccurate Latin translation of the above text of Clement of Alexandria: it mistranslated &quot;ναῦς οὐριοδρομοῦσα&quot; as Latin &quot;Navis coelestis cursu in coelum tendens&quot; (&quot;Ship of the sky following a course in the sky&quot;), perhaps misunderstanding &quot;οὐριο-&quot; as &quot;up in the air or sky&quot; by analogy with οὐρανός = &quot;sky&quot;.
* 1679: Halley mentioned Columba in his work &quot;Catalogus Stellarum Australium&quot; from his observations on St. Helena.
* 1679: Augustin Royer published a star atlas that showed Columba as a constellation.
* c.1690: Hevelius&#x27;s Prodromus Astronomiae showed Columba but did not list it as a constellation.
* 1712 (pirated) and 1725 (authorized): Flamsteed&#x27;s work &quot;Historia Coelestis Britannica&quot; showed Columba but did not list it as a constellation.
* 1757 or 1763: Lacaille listed Columba as a constellation and catalogued its stars.
* 1889: Richard H. Allen, misled by Caesius&#x27;s mistranslation, wrote that the Columba asterism may have been invented in Roman/Greek times, but with a footnote saying that it may have been another star group.
* 2019: OSIRIS-REx students discovered a black hole in the constellation Columba, based on observing X-ray bursts.

==Features==

===Stars===

Columba is rather inconspicuous with the brightest star, Alpha Columbae, being only of magnitude 2.7. This, a blue-white star, has a pre-Bayer, traditional, Arabic name &quot;Phact&quot; (meaning ring dove) and is 268 light-years from Earth. The only other named star is Beta Columbae, which has the alike-status name &quot;Wazn&quot;. It is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 3.1, 87 light-years away. The constellation contains the runaway star μ Columbae. Exoplanet NGTS-1b and its star NGTS-1 are in Columba.

===General radial velocity===
Columba contains the solar antapex – the opposite to the net direction of the solar system

===Deep-sky objects===
The globular cluster NGC 1851 appears in Columba at 7th magnitude in a far part of our galaxy at 39,000 light-years away - it is resolvable south of at greatest latitude +40°N in medium-sized amateur telescopes (under good conditions).

<text>Horologium (Latin , the pendulum clock, from Greek , ) is a constellation of six stars faintly visible in the southern celestial hemisphere. It was first described by the French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in 1756 and visualized by him as a clock with a pendulum and a second hand. In 1922 the constellation was redefined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) as a region of the celestial sphere containing Lacaille&#x27;s stars, and has since been an IAU designated constellation. Horologium&#x27;s associated region is wholly visible to observers south of 23°N.

The constellation&#x27;s brightest star—and the only one brighter than an apparent magnitude of 4—is Alpha Horologii (at 3.85), an aging orange giant star that has swollen to around 11 times the diameter of the Sun. The long-period variable-brightness star, R Horologii (4.7 to 14.3), has one of the largest variations in brightness among all stars in the night sky visible to the unaided eye. Four star systems in the constellation are known to have exoplanets; at least one—Gliese 1061—contains an exoplanet in its habitable zone.

==History==
The French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille first described the constellation as &quot;l&#x27;Horloge à pendule &amp; à secondes&quot; (Clock with pendulum and seconds hand) in 1756, after he had observed and catalogued almost 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the Cape of Good Hope. He devised fourteen new constellations in previously uncharted regions of the southern celestial hemisphere, which were not visible from Europe. All but one honoured scientific instruments, and so symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. The constellation name was Latinised to &quot;Horologium&quot; in a catalogue and updated chart published posthumously in 1763. The Latin term is ultimately derived from the Ancient Greek ὡρολόγιον, for an instrument for telling the hour.

==Characteristics==

Covering a total of 248.9 square degrees or 0.603% of the sky, Horologium ranks 58th in area out of the 88 modern constellations. Its position in the southern celestial hemisphere means the whole constellation is visible to observers south of 23°N. Horologium is bordered by five constellations: Eridanus (the Po river or Nile river), Caelum (the chisel), Reticulum (the reticle), Dorado (the dolphin/swordfish), and Hydrus (the &quot;male&quot; water snake). The three letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;Hor&quot;. The official constellation boundaries are defined by a twenty-two-sided polygon (&quot;illustrated in infobox&quot;). In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between −39.64° and −67.04°.

==Features==
===Stars===
Horologium has one star brighter than apparent magnitude 4, and 41 stars brighter than or equal to magnitude 6.5. Lacaille charted and designated 11 stars in the constellation, giving them the Bayer designations Alpha (α Hor) through Lambda Horologii (λ Hor) in 1756. In the mid-19th century, English astronomer Francis Baily removed the designations of two—Epsilon and Theta Horologii—as he held they were too faint to warrant naming. He was unable to find a star that corresponded to the coordinates of Lacaille&#x27;s Beta Horologii. Determining that the coordinates were wrong, he assigned the designation to another star. Kappa Horologii, too, was unable to be verified—although it most likely was the star HD 18292—and the name fell out of use. In 1879, American astronomer Benjamin Apthorp Gould assigned designations to what became Mu and Nu Horologii as he felt they were bright enough to warrant them.

At magnitude 3.9, Alpha Horologii is the brightest star in the constellation, located 115 (±0.5) light-years from Earth. German astronomer Johann Elert Bode depicted it as the pendulum of the clock, while Lacaille made it one of the weights. It is an orange giant star of spectral type K2III that has swollen to around 11 times the diameter of the Sun, having spent much of its life as a white main-sequence star. At an estimated 1.55 times the mass of the Sun, it is radiating 38 times the Sun&#x27;s luminosity from its photosphere at an effective (surface) temperature of 5,028K.

At magnitude 4.93, Delta Horologii is the second-brightest star in the constellation, and forms a wide optical double with Alpha. Delta itself is a true binary system composed of a white main sequence star of spectral type A5V that is 1.41 times as massive as the Sun with a magnitude of 5.15 and its fainter companion of magnitude 7.29. The system is located 179 (±4) light-years from the earth.

At magnitude 5.0, Beta Horologii is a white giant 63 times as luminous as the Sun with an effective temperature of 8,303K. It is 312 (±4) light-years from Earth, and has been little-studied. Lambda Horologii is an ageing yellow-white giant star of spectral type F2III that spins around at 140km/second, and is hence mildly flattened at its poles (oblate). It is 161 (±1) light-years from Earth.

With a magnitude of 5.24, Nu Horologii is a white main sequence star of spectral type A2V located 169 (±1) light-years from Earth that is around 1.9 times as massive as the Sun. Estimated to be around 540 million years old, it has a debris disk that appears to have two components: an inner disk is orbiting at a distance of , while an outer disk lies from the star. The estimated mass of the disks is the mass of the Earth.

Horologium has several variable stars. R Horologii is a red giant Mira variable with one of the widest ranges in brightness known of stars in the night sky visible to the unaided eye. It is around 1,000 light-years from Earth. It has a minimum magnitude of 14.3 and a maximum magnitude of 4.7, with a period of approximately 13 months. T and U Horologii are also Mira variables. The Astronomical Society of Southern Africa reported in 2003 that observations of these two stars were needed as data on their light curves was incomplete. TW Horologii is a semiregular variable red giant star that is classified as a carbon star, and is 1,370 (±70) light-years from Earth.

Iota Horologii is a yellow-white dwarf star 1.23 (±0.12) times as massive and 1.16 (±0.04) times as wide as the Sun with a spectral type of F8V, 57 (±0.05) light-years from Earth. Its chemical profile, movement and age indicate it formed within the Hyades cluster but has drifted around 130 light-years away from the other members. It has a planet at least 2.5 times as massive as Jupiter orbiting it every 307 days. HD 27631 is a Sun-like star located 164 (±0.3) light-years from Earth which was found to have a planet at least 1.45 times as massive as Jupiter that takes 2,208 (±66) days (six years) to complete an orbit. WASP-120 is a yellow-white main-sequence star around 1.4 times as massive as the Sun with a spectral type of F5V that is estimated to be 2.6 (±0.5) billion years old. It has a massive planet around 4.85 times the mass of Jupiter that completes its orbit every 3.6 days, and has an estimated surface temperature of 1,880 (±70)K.

With an apparent magnitude of 13.06, Gliese 1061 is a red dwarf of spectral type M5.5V that has 12% of the mass and 15% of the diameter of the Sun, and shines with only 0.17% of its luminosity. Located 12 light-years away from Earth, it is the 20th-closest single star or stellar system to the Sun. In August 2019, it was announced that it had three planets, one of which lay in its habitable zone.

===Deep-sky objects===
Horologium is home to many deep-sky objects, including several globular clusters. NGC 1261 is a globular cluster of magnitude 8, located 53,000 light-years from Earth. It lies 4.7 degrees north-northeast of Mu Horologii. The globular cluster Arp-Madore 1 is the most remote known globular cluster in the Milky Way at a distance of from Earth.

NGC 1512 is a barred spiral galaxy 2.1 degrees west-southwest of Alpha Horologii with an apparent magnitude of 10.2. About five arcmin (13.8 kpc) away is the dwarf lenticular galaxy NGC 1510. The two are in the process of a merger which has been going on for 400 million years.

The Horologium-Reticulum Supercluster is a galaxy supercluster, second in size only to the Shapley Supercluster in the local universe (anything within 200 mpc of Earth). It contains over 20 Abell galaxy clusters and covers more than 100 deg2 of the sky, centered roughly at equatorial coordinates α = , δ = .

<doc id="211833" wikidata="Q10450" url="?curid=211833" title="Indus (constellation)">
<text>Indus is a constellation in the southern sky first professionally surveyed by Europeans in the 1590s and mapped on a globe by Petrus Plancius by early 1598. It was included on a plate illustrating southern constellations in Bayer&#x27;s sky atlas &quot;Uranometria&quot; in 1603. It lies well south of the Tropic of Capricorn but its triangular shape can be seen for most of the year from the Equator. It is elongated from north to south and has a complex boundary. The English translation of its name is generally given as &quot;the Indian&quot;, though it is unclear which indigenous people the constellation was originally supposed to represent.

==Features==
Indus lacks stars of the top 100 in brightness viewed from the solar system (apparent magnitude). Two of its stars rank of third magnitude and three of fourth magnitude.
=== Bright stars ===
Alpha Indi, its brightest, is an orange giant of magnitude 3.1, 101 light-years away. Beta Indi is an orange giant of magnitude 3.7, 600 light-years distant. Delta Indi is a white star of magnitude 4.4, 185 light-years from Earth. The three form a near-perfect right-angled triangle, such that Beta marks the right angle and is in the south-east.

Epsilon Indi is one of the closest stars to Earth, approximately 11.8 light years away. It is an orange dwarf of magnitude 4.7, meaning that the yellow dwarf Sun is slightly hotter and larger. The system has been discovered to contain a pair of binary brown dwarfs, and has long been a prime candidate in SETI studies. This star has the third-highest proper motion of all visible to the unaided eye, as ranks behind Groombridge 1830 and 61 Cygni, and the ninth-highest overall. This will move the star into Tucana around 2640. It figures directly between Alpha and Beta.

Indus is home to one bright binary star. Theta Indi is a binary star divisible in small amateur telescopes, 97 light-years from Earth. Its primary is a white star of magnitude 4.5 and its secondary is a white star of magnitude 7.0. It figures close to the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle of Alpha, Beta and Delta, the three brightest stars of Indus.
=== Variable stars ===
T Indi is the only bright variable star in Indus. It is a semi-regular, deeply coloured red giant with a period of 11 months, 1900 light-years away. Its minimum magnitude is 7 and its maximum: 5.

=== Galaxies ===
Galaxies include NGC 7038, NGC 7049, and NGC 7090.

=== Supernovae ===
All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) in 2015 detected a superluminous supernova, named ASASSN-15lh (also designated SN 2015L). Based on the study conducted by Subo Dong and team from the Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics (KIAA) at Peking University, it was approximately doubly luminous to any supernova detected, and at peak was almost 50 times more intrinsically luminous than the Milky Way.
Its distance: approximately 3.82 gigalight-years, denoting an age approximately half that of the universe.

==History==
The constellation was created by Petrus Plancius who made a fairly large celestial globe from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas followed in Johann Bayer&#x27;s &quot;Uranometria&quot; of 1603. Plancius portrayed the figure as a nude male with three arrows in one hand and one in the other, as a native, lacking quiver and bow. It is among the twelve constellations introduced by Keyser and de Houtman, which first appeared on a celestial globe in 1598.

<doc id="211834" wikidata="Q1433544" url="?curid=211834" title="Holborn tube station">
<text>Holborn ( ) is a London Underground station in Holborn, Central London, located at the junction of High Holborn and Kingsway. It is served by the Central and Piccadilly lines and is located in Travelcard Zone 1. On the Central line the station is between Tottenham Court Road and Chancery Lane stations, and on the Piccadilly line it is between Covent Garden and Russell Square stations. Close by are the British Museum, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, Red Lion Square, Bloomsbury Square, London School of Economics and Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum.

Located at the junction of two earlier tube railway schemes, the station was opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR). The station entrances and below ground circulation were largely reconstructed for the introduction of escalators and the opening of Central line platforms in 1933, making the station the only interchange between the lines. Before 1994, Holborn was the northern terminus of the short and little-frequented Piccadilly line branch to Aldwych and two platforms originally used for this service are disused. One of the disused platforms has been used for location filming when a London Underground station platform is needed.

While the two disused platforms are now closed to the public, they can be still be seen on a &quot;Hidden London&quot; guided tour held by London Transport Museum.

== Planning ==
The station was planned by the Great Northern and Strand Railway (GN&amp;SR), which had received parliamentary approval for a route from Wood Green station (now Alexandra Palace) to Strand in 1899. After the GN&amp;SR was taken over by the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway (B&amp;PCR) in September 1901, the two companies came under the control of Charles Yerkes&#x27; Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company before being transferred to his new holding company, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) in June 1902. To connect the two companies&#x27; planned routes, the UERL obtained permission for new tunnels between Piccadilly Circus and Holborn. The companies were formally merged as the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway following parliamentary approval in November 1902.

== Construction ==
The linking of the GN&amp;SR and B&amp;PCR routes at Holborn meant that the section of the GN&amp;SR south of Holborn became a branch from the main route. The UERL began constructing the main route in July 1902. Progress was rapid, so that it was largely complete by the Autumn of 1906. Construction of the branch was delayed while the London County Council carried out slum clearances to construct its new road Kingsway and the tramway subway running beneath it and while the UERL decided how the junction between the main route and the branch would be arranged at Holborn.

When originally planned by the GN&amp;SR, Holborn station was to have just two platforms. The first GNP&amp;BR plan for the station would have seen the two platforms shared by trains on the main route and by the shuttle service on the branch with the junctions between the tunnels south of the station. The interference that shuttle trains would have caused to services on the main route led to a redesign so that two northbound platforms were provided, one for the main line and one for the branch line, with a single southbound platform. The junctions between the two northbound tunnels would have been north of the platforms. When powers were sought to build the junction in 1905, the layout was changed again so that four platforms were to be provided. The southbound tunnel of the main route no longer connected to the branch, which was to be provided with an additional platform in a dead-end tunnel accessed from a crossover from the northbound branch tunnel. As built, for ease of passenger access, the branch&#x27;s northbound tunnel ended in a dead-end platform adjacent to the northbound main line platform with the branch&#x27;s southbound tunnel connected to the northbound main line tunnel. To enable the southbound tunnel of the main route to avoid the branch tunnels, it was constructed at a lower level than the other tunnels and platforms. The tunnel towards Covent Garden (at this point heading south-west) passes under the branch tunnels.

As with most of the other GNP&amp;BR stations, the station building was designed by Leslie Green, though at Holborn the station frontage was, uniquely, constructed in stone rather than the standard red glazed terracotta. This was due to planning regulations imposed by the London County Council which required the use of stone for façades in Kingsway. The station entrance and exit sections of the street façade were constructed in granite with the other parts of the ground and first floors in the same style, but using Portland stone. The rest of the building above first floor level was constructed contemporaneously with the station. Access to the platform levels of the station was provided by trapezium-shaped electric lifts manufactured by Otis in America. These operated in pairs in shared circular shafts, with an escape stair in a separate, smaller shaft.

Although the station was constructed where the GNP&amp;BR&#x27;s tunnels crossed those of the Central London Railway (CLR, now the Central line) running under High Holborn, no interchange between the two lines was made as the CLR&#x27;s nearest station, British Museum, was to the west. Passengers wishing to interchange between the two stations had to do so at street level.

The station opened on 15 December 1906, although the opening of the branch was delayed until 30 November 1907.

== 1930s station modernisation ==

The street level interchange between the GNP&amp;BR and CLR involving two sets of lifts was considered a weakness in the network. A below ground subway connection was considered in 1907. A proposal to enlarge the CLR&#x27;s tunnels to create new platforms at Holborn station and to abandon British Museum station was included in a private bill submitted to parliament by the CLR in November 1913, although the First World War prevented any works taking place.

Like many other central London Underground stations, Holborn was modernised in the early 1930s to replace the lifts with escalators. The station frontages on Kingsway and High Holborn were partially reconstructed to modernist designs by Charles Holden with the granite elements replaced with plain Portland stone façades perforated with glazed screens. The lifts were removed and a spacious new ticket hall was provided giving access to a bank of four escalators down to an intermediate concourse for the Central line platforms. A second bank of three escalators continues down to the Piccadilly line platforms.

To construct the new Central line platforms, the larger diameter station tunnels were manually excavated around the existing running tunnels whilst trains continued to run. When the excavations were complete, the original segmental tunnel linings were dismantled. The new platforms came into use on 25 September 1933 replacing those of British Museum, which had closed the day before. As part of the modernisation the station was renamed Holborn (Kingsway) on 22 May 1933, but the suffix gradually dropped out of use and no longer appears on station signage or tube maps. It was displayed on the platform roundels until the 1980s.

The new platforms at Holborn led to the number of passengers switching between the lines increasing tenfold by 1938.

== Mural additions in the 1980s ==
The station was redecorated in the 1980s, with platform walls lined with panels of enamelled metal forming murals designed by Allan Drummond that reference the British Museum. These murals reference Egyptian and Roman antiquities, with sarcophagi, statues and trompe-l&#x27;œil columns on the walls of the platform.

== Branch operations ==

Initially, shuttle train services on the branch operated from the through platform at Holborn. At peak times, an additional train operated alternately in the branch&#x27;s western tunnel from the bay platform at Holborn. During the first year of operation, a train for theatregoers operated late on Monday to Saturday evenings from Strand through Holborn and northbound to Finsbury Park; this was discontinued in October 1908.

In March 1908, the off-peak shuttle service began to use the western tunnel on the branch, crossing between the two branch tunnels south of Holborn. Low usage led to the withdrawal of the second peak-hour shuttle and the eastern tunnel was taken out of use in 1914. Sunday services ended in April 1917 and, in August of the same year, the eastern tunnel and the bay platform at Holborn were formally closed. Passenger numbers on the branch remained low: when the branch was considered for closure in 1929, its annual usage was 1,069,650 and takings were £4,500. The branch was again considered for closure in 1933, but remained open.

Wartime efficiency measures led to the branch being closed temporarily on 22 September 1940, shortly after the start of The Blitz, and it was partly fitted out by the City of Westminster as an air-raid shelter. The tunnels were used to store items from the British Museum, including the Elgin Marbles. The branch reopened on 1 July 1946, but patronage did not increase. In 1958, London Transport announced it would be closed. Again it survived, but the service was reduced in June 1958 to run only during Monday to Friday peak hours and Saturday morning and early afternoons. The Saturday service was withdrawn in June 1962.

After operating only during peak hours for more than 30 years, the closure announcement came on 4 January 1993. The original 1907 lifts at Aldwych required replacement at a cost of £3 million. This was not justifiable as only 450 passengers used the station each day and it was losing London Regional Transport £150,000 per year. The secretary of state for transport granted permission on 1 September 1994 to close the station and the branch closed on 30 September.

After its closure in 1917, the bay platform was converted into rooms for use, at various times, as offices, air-raid shelters, store rooms, an electrical sub-station and a war-time hostel. Since 1994, the branch&#x27;s remaining platform at Holborn has been used to test mock-up designs for new platform signage and advertising systems.

== Future developments ==
In the aftermath of the King&#x27;s Cross fire in 1987, the Fennell Report into the disaster recommended that London Underground investigate &quot;passenger flow and congestion in stations and take remedial action&quot;. A private bill was submitted to parliament and approved as the &quot;London Underground (Safety Measures) Act 1991&quot; giving London Underground powers to improve and expand the frequently congested station with a new ticket hall and new subways. The expansion works were not carried out and the arrangement of the station remains much the same as it was in the 1930s.

According to Transport for London (TfL), the station is at capacity because of the large number of passengers leaving and entering the station, as well as the large numbers of passengers changing between lines. Currently, everyone who uses the station has to pass through the intermediate concourse at the bottom of the main escalators. This causes congestion and delays.

In September 2017, TfL proposed various station improvements including a second entrance on Procter Street to the north-east of the station, lifts to provide step free access, and new tunnels to improve the interchange between the Central and Piccadilly lines. Owing to the delay in the opening of Crossrail and the subsequent knock on effect on TfL&#x27;s Business Plan, the upgrade to Holborn station is now not expected to commence until 2023/24, with the works taking around six years to complete, doubling the size of the station.

==Incidents and accidents==

The Holborn rail crash occurred on the Central line at Holborn on 9 July 1980, at about 13:28 and involved two 1962 stock trains. The 13:17 train from Liverpool Street to White City, standing at the westbound platform, was run into by the 12:49 Hainault to Ealing Broadway train. The rear train was slowing after its brakes had been applied by the emergency train stop system because it had passed two signals at danger, but it failed to stop in time to avoid collision. The driver of the rear train and 20 passengers were injured. An inquiry concluded that the accident was caused by the driver failing to control his train. Disruption of services occurred until the following morning.

On 21 October 1997, a 9-year-old boy, Ajit Singh, was dragged to his death after a toggle on his anorak was trapped in the closing doors of a Piccadilly line train.

==Use in media==
The disused branch line platform and other parts of the station have been used in the filming of music videos for Howard Jones&#x27; &quot;New Song&quot;, Leftfield&#x27;s &quot;Release the Pressure&quot;, Suede&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night&quot; and Aqua&#x27;s &quot;Turn Back Time&quot;.

The pre-war operation of the station and the branch line features in a pivotal scene in Geoffrey Household&#x27;s novel &quot;Rogue Male&quot;, when the pursuit of the protagonist by enemy agents sees them repeatedly using the station&#x27;s escalators, passageways and the shuttle service.

==Use in particle physics==
Patrick Blackett (who won the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the positron), developed plans to install a cosmic ray detector on an abandoned platform of the Holborn Station following a row with his mentor Lord Rutherford at Cambridge University. The plans included an 11-ton magnet and a cloud chamber, and were hailed by the London tabloid press at the time as the efforts of a &quot;new &#x27;Sherlock Holmes&#x27;, hunting beneath the streets of London for clues about the mysteries of the universe.&quot;

==Services==

The station is in London fare zone 1. On the Central line the station is between Tottenham Court Road and Chancery Lane, and on the Piccadilly line, it is between Covent Garden and Russell Square. Holborn is the only direct interchange between these lines. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally Central line trains operate every 2–6 minutes from approximately 05:53 to 00:30 westbound and 05:51 to 00:33 eastbound. Piccadilly line trains operate every 2–6 minutes from approximately 05:42 to 00:28 westbound and 05:54 to 00:38 northbound.

==Connections==

===Historical tram connections===
Before the closure of the original London tram network in 1952, Holborn tube station provided an interchange between trams and tubes, via the Kingsway Tramway Subway underground Holborn tramway station located a little distance south of the underground station. This was the only part of London with an underground tram system, and Holborn tramway station (named Great Queen Street when first opened) is still extant beneath ground, though with no public access.

===Current bus connections===
London Buses routes 1, 8, 59, 68, 91, 133, 188 and 243, limited Superloop route SL6 and night routes N1, N8, N25, N68, N91, N171 and N242 serve the station.

<text>The Erdős–Borwein constant, named after Paul Erdős and Peter Borwein, is the sum of the reciprocals of the Mersenne numbers.

By definition it is:

:formula_1

==Equivalent forms==
It can be proven that the following forms all sum to the same constant:

:formula_2

:formula_3

:formula_4

:formula_5

where σ0(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;d&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the divisor function, a multiplicative function that equals the number of positive divisors of the number &quot;n&quot;. To prove the equivalence of these sums, note that they all take the form of Lambert series and can thus be resummed as such.

==Irrationality==
In 1948, Erdős showed that the constant &quot;E&quot; is an irrational number. Later, Borwein provided an alternative proof.

Despite its irrationality, the binary representation of the Erdős–Borwein constant may be calculated efficiently.

==Applications==
The Erdős–Borwein constant comes up in the average case analysis of the heapsort algorithm, where it controls the constant factor in the running time for converting an unsorted array of items into a heap.

<doc id="211843" wikidata="Q385334" url="?curid=211843" title="Culture of Israel">
<text>The culture of Israel is closely associated with Jewish culture and rooted in the Jewish history of the diaspora and Zionist movement. It has also been influenced by Arab culture and the history and traditions of the Arab Israeli population and other ethnic minorities that live in Israel, among them Druze, Circassians, Armenians and others.

Tel Aviv and Jerusalem are considered the main cultural hubs of Israel. The &quot;New York Times&quot; has described Tel Aviv as the &quot;capital of Mediterranean cool,&quot; &quot;Lonely Planet&quot; ranked it as a top ten city for nightlife, and &quot;National Geographic&quot; named it one of the top ten beach cities. Similarly, Jerusalem has earned international acclaim; &quot;Time&quot; magazine included it in its list of the &quot;World’s Greatest Places,&quot; and &quot;Travel+Leisure&quot; ranked it as the third favorite city in ME and Africa among its readers.

With over 200 museums, Israel has the highest number of museums per capita in the world, with millions of visitors annually. Israeli art&#x27;s development, heavily influenced by 20th century European trends was heavily centered in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Major art museums operate in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa and Herzliya, as well as in many towns and Kibbutzim. The Israel Philharmonic Orchestra plays at venues throughout the country and abroad, and almost every city has its own orchestra, many of the musicians hailing from the former Soviet Union. Folk dancing is popular in Israel, and Israeli modern dance companies, among them the Batsheva Dance Company, are highly acclaimed in the dance world. Habima Theatre, which is considered the national theatre of Israel, was established in 1917. Israeli filmmakers and actors have won awards at international film festivals in recent years. Since the 1980s, Israeli literature has been widely translated, and several Israeli writers have achieved international recognition.

There has been minimal cultural exchange between Israel’s Jewish and Arab populations. Jews from Arab-Muslim Middle East communities brought with them elements from the majority cultures in which they lived. The mixing of Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Middle Eastern traditions have advanced modern Israeli culture, along with traditions brought by Russian, former Soviet republican, Central European and American immigrants. The Hebrew language revival has also developed Israel’s modern culture. Israel’s culture is based on its cultural diversity, shared language, and common religious and historical Jewish tradition.

==History==

With a diverse population of immigrants from five continents and more than 100 countries, and significant subcultures like the Mizrahim, Arabs, Russian Jews, Ethiopian Jews, Secular Jews and the Ultra Orthodox, each with its own cultural networks, Israeli culture is extremely varied. It follows cultural trends, and changes across the globe, as well as expressing a unique spirit of its own. In addition, Israel is a family-oriented society with a strong sense of community.

===Influences and impact===
====Ancient Near East civilizations====

Ancient Israel, as a civilization of the ancient Near East, was influenced to some degree by other regional cultures. The Paleo-Hebrew alphabet was adapted from the Phoenician alphabet and the square script is a derivative of the Aramaic alphabet. Zoroastrianism of Ancient Iran is believed to had an influence on Jewish eschatology. Jewish mythology contains similarities to Mesopotamian mythologies, such as the Enūma Eliš of Babylon, the Genesis creation narrative, the Epic of Gilgamesh, and the Genesis flood narrative.

====Judaism, Christianity and Western civilization====

Judaism, which originated in Ancient Israel, represents the foundation of much of Western civilization&#x27;s traits, thanks to its relation to Christianity. It impacted the West in a multitude of ways, from its ethics, to its practices to monotheism; all of its benefits largely impacted the world through Christianity. The Hebrew Bible, authored by Jews in the Land of Israel from the 8th to the 2nd century BCE, is a cornerstone of Western civilization. Around 63 BCE, Judea became part of the Roman Empire; around 6 BCE, Jesus was born to a Jewish family in the town of Nazareth, and decades later, was crucified under Pontius Pilate. His followers later believed that he was resurrected, inspiring them to spread the new Christian religion throughout the world. Christianity took hold in the Hellenistic Greco-Roman world, which eventually grew into the entirety of Europe, thanks to Roman expansion. These nations later became the very foundation of today&#x27;s &#x27;Western world&#x27;.

Christianity, the religion of the West and essential religion of the Western World, grew from Judaism, and began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the mid-1st century. The New Testament, authored by first-century Jews, is one of the bedrock texts of Western civilization as well.

====Islamic civilization====

Islam was strongly influenced by Judaism in its fundamental religious outlook, structure, jurisprudence and practice. Islam derives its ideas of holy text, the Qur&#x27;an, ultimately from Judaism, and contains references to more than fifty people and events also found in the Bible including the creation narrative, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, the Genesis flood narrative, Abraham, Sodom and Gomorrah, Moses and the Exodus, King David and the Jewish prophets. The New Testament, authored by Jews in Roman Judea, also influenced Islam. Additionally, the Qur&#x27;an mentions figures such as Jesus, Mary and John the Baptist. The dietary and legal codes of Islam, the basic design of the mosque, and the communal prayer services of Islam, including their devotional routines, are derived from Judaism.

===&#x27;Melting pot&#x27; approach===
With the waves of Jewish aliyah in the 19th and 20th centuries, the existing culture was supplemented by the culture and traditions of the immigrant population. Zionism links the Jewish people to the Land of Israel, the homeland of the Jews between around 1200 BCE and 70 CE (end of the Second Temple era). However, modern Zionism evolved both politically and religiously. Though Zionist groups were first competing with other Jewish political movements, Zionism became an equivalent to political Judaism during and after The Holocaust.

The first Israeli prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, led a trend to blend the many immigrants who, in the first years of the state, had arrived from Europe, North Africa, and Asia, into one &#x27;melting pot&#x27; that would not differentiate between the older residents of the country, and the new immigrants. The original purpose was to unify the newer immigrants with the veteran Israelis, for the creation of a common Hebrew culture, and to build a new nation in the country.

Two central tools employed for this purpose were the Israel Defense Forces, and the education system. The Israel Defense Forces, by means of its transformation to a national army, would constitute a common ground among all civilians of the country, wherever they are. The education system, having been unified under Israeli law, enabled different students from different sectors to study together at the same schools. Gradually, Israeli society became more pluralistic, and the &#x27;melting pot&#x27; declined over the years.

Some critics of the &#x27;melting pot&#x27; consider it to have been a necessity in the first years of the state, in order to build a mutual society, but now claim that there is no longer a need for it. They instead see a need for Israeli society to enable people to express the differences, and the exclusivity, of every stream and sector. Others, mainly Mizrahi Jews who are more Shomer Masoret and the Holocaust survivors, have criticized the early &#x27;melting pot&#x27; process. According to them, they were forced to give up or conceal their Jewish Masoret, and their diaspora heritage and culture, which they brought from their diaspora countries, and to adopt the new secular &quot;Sabra&quot; culture.

Today, cultural diversity is celebrated; many speak several languages, continue to eat the food of their cultural origins, and have mixed outlooks.

==Language==

While Hebrew is the official language of the State of Israel, over 83 languages are spoken in the country.

As new immigrants arrived, Hebrew language instruction was important. Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, who founded the Hebrew Language Committee, coined thousands of new words and concepts based on Biblical, Talmudic and other sources, to cope with the needs and demands of life in the 20th century. Learning Hebrew became a national goal, employing the slogan &quot;Yehudi, daber Ivrit&quot; (&quot;Jew—speak Hebrew&quot;). Special schools for Hebrew language learning, &quot;ulpanim&quot;, were set up all over the country.

The Hebraizing of family names was common in the pre-state period, and became more widespread in the 1950s. In the early years of the state, a pamphlet was published on how to choose a Hebrew name. The prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, urged anyone who represented the state in a formal capacity to adopt a Hebrew surname.

==Education==

In 2012, Israel was named the second most educated country in the world, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)&#x27;s Education at a Glance report, released in 2012. The report found that 78% of the money invested in education is from public funds, and 45% of the population has a university or college diploma.

==Philosophy==

===Ancient Israel===

Ancient Israeli philosophical ideas and approach can be found in the Bible. Psalms contains invitations to admire the wisdom of God through his works; from this, some scholars suggest, Judaism harbors a Philosophical under-current. The exegetical work of Psalm 132 stands between philosophy of language, and linguistic philosophy.

Ecclesiastes is often considered to be the only genuine philosophical work in the Hebrew Bible; its author seeks to understand the place of human beings in the world, and life&#x27;s meaning. Ecclesiastes and the Book of Job were favorite works of medieval philosophers, who took them as philosophical discussions not dependent on historical revelation. Ecclesiastes has had a deep influence on Western literature. It contains several phrases that have resonated in British and American culture, such as &quot;eat, drink and be merry,&quot; &quot;nothing new under the sun,&quot; &quot;a time to be born and a time to die,&quot; and &quot;vanity of vanities; all is vanity.&quot;

In other books such as Proverbs or Sirach and Book of Wisdom of the Jewish apocrypha, there are references and praise to the concept of wisdom, which was to have a primordial significance for Jewish thought.

===Roman Judea===
Philosophical speculation was not a central part of Rabbinic Judaism, although some have seen the Mishnah as a philosophical work. Rabbi Akiva has also been viewed as a philosophical figure: his statements include 1.) &quot;How favored is man, for he was created after an image &quot;for in an image, Elohim made man&quot; (Gen. ix. 6); 2.) &quot;Everything is foreseen; but freedom &quot;[of will]&quot; is given to every man&quot;; 3.) &quot;The world is governed by mercy... but the divine decision is made by the preponderance of the good or bad in one&#x27;s actions&quot;. Like Philo, who saw in the Hebrew construction of the infinitive with the finite form of the same verb and in certain particles (adverbs, prepositions, etc.) some deep reference to philosophical and ethical doctrines, Akiva perceived in them indications of many important ceremonial laws, legal statutes, and ethical teachings.

A tannaitic tradition mentions that of the four who entered paradise, Akiva was the only one that returned unscathed. This serves at least to show how strong in later ages was the recollection of Akiva&#x27;s philosophical speculation Akiva&#x27;s anthropology is based upon the principle that man was created בצלם, that is, not in the image of God—which would be בצלם אלהים—but after an image, after a primordial type; or, philosophically speaking, after an Idea—what Philo calls in agreement with Judean theology, &quot;the first heavenly man&quot; (see Adam ḳadmon).

===Modern Israel===

Modern Israeli philosophy has been influenced by both secular and religious Jewish thought.

Martin Buber best known for his philosophy of dialogue, a form of existentialism centered on the distinction between the I–Thou relationship and the I–It relationship. In &quot;I and Thou&quot;, Buber introduced his thesis on human existence; Ich‑Du is a relationship that stresses the mutual, holistic existence of two beings. It is a concrete encounter, because these beings meet one another in their authentic existence, without any qualification or objectification of one another. Even imagination and ideas do not play a role in this relation. In an I–Thou encounter, infinity and universality are made actual (rather than being merely concepts). The &quot;Ich-Es&quot; (&quot;I‑It&quot;) relationship is nearly the opposite of &quot;Ich‑Du&quot;. Whereas in &quot;Ich‑Du&quot; the two beings encounter one another, in an &quot;Ich‑Es&quot; relationship the beings do not actually meet. Instead, the &quot;I&quot; confronts and qualifies an idea, or conceptualization, of the being in its presence and treats that being as an object. All such objects are considered merely mental representations, created and sustained by the individual mind.

Yeshayahu Leibowitz was an Orthodox Jew who held controversial views on the subject of halakha, or Jewish rabbinical law. He wrote that the sole purpose of religious commandments was to obey God, and not to receive any kind of reward in this world, or the world to come. He maintained that the reasons for religious commandments were beyond man&#x27;s understanding, as well as irrelevant, and any attempt to attribute emotional significance to the performance of mitzvot was misguided, and akin to idolatry. The essence of Leibowitz&#x27;s religious outlook is that a person&#x27;s faith is his commitment to obey God, meaning God&#x27;s commandments, and this has nothing to do with a person&#x27;s image of God. This is a possibility, because Leibowitz thought that God cannot be described, that God&#x27;s understanding is not man&#x27;s understanding, and thus all the questions asked of God are out of place. One result of this approach is that faith, which is a personal commitment to obey God, cannot be challenged by the usual philosophical problem of evil, or by historical events that seemingly contradict a divine presence. If a person stops believing after an awful event, it shows that he only obeyed God because he thought he understood God&#x27;s plan, or because he expected to see a reward. But “for Leibowitz, religious belief is not an explanation of life, nature or history, or a promise of a future in this world or another, but a demand.”

Joseph Raz is a legal, moral, and political philosopher. Raz&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Concept of a Legal System&quot;, was based on his doctoral thesis. A later book, &quot;The Morality of Freedom&quot;, develops a conception of perfectionist liberalism. Raz has argued for a distinctive understanding of legal commands as exclusionary reasons for action and for the &quot;service conception&quot; of authority, according to which those subject to an authority, &quot;can benefit by its decisions only if they can establish their existence and content in ways which do not depend on raising the very same issues which the authority is there to settle.&quot; This, in turn, supports Raz&#x27;s argument for legal positivism, in particular &quot;the sources thesis,&quot; &quot;the idea that an adequate test for the existence and content of law must be based only on social facts, and not on moral arguments.&quot;. Raz is acknowledged by his contemporaries as being one of the most important living legal philosophers. He has authored and edited eleven books to date, namely &quot;The Concept of a Legal System&quot;, &quot;Practical Reason and Norms&quot;, &quot;The Authority of Law&quot;, &quot;The Morality of Freedom&quot;, &quot;Authority&quot;, &quot;Ethics in the Public Domain&quot;, &quot;Engaging Reason&quot;, &quot;Value, Respect and Attachment&quot;, &quot;The Practice of Value&quot;, &quot;Between Authority and Interpretation&quot;, and &quot;From Normativity to Responsibility&quot;. In moral theory, Raz defends value pluralism and the idea that various values are incommensurable.

Other notable Israeli philosophers include Avishai Margalit, Hugo Bergmann, Yehoshua Bar-Hillel, Pinchas Lapide, Israel Eldad and Judea Pearl.
==Literature and poetry==
===Ancient Israel===

The earliest known inscription in Hebrew is the Khirbet Qeiyafa Inscription (11th — 10th century BCE), if it can indeed be considered Hebrew at that early a stage. This inscription is by far the most varied, extensive, and historically significant body of literature written in the old Classical Hebrew, and is the canon of the Hebrew Bible. The Bible is not a single, monolithic piece of literature, because each of these three sections, in turn, contains books written at different times by different authors, written from the 8th to the 2nd century BCE. It is the primary source of ancient Israelite mythology, literature, philosophy and poetry. All books of the Bible are not strictly religious in nature; for example, &quot;The Song of Songs&quot; is a love poem, and, along with &quot;The Book of Esther&quot;, does not explicitly mention God.

The Ketuvim sector of the Hebrew Bible is a collection of philosophical and artistic literature believed to have been written under the influence of Ruach ha-Kodesh (the Holy Spirit). The Book of Job, for instance, addressing the problem of theodicy – the vindication of the justice of God in the light of humanity&#x27;s suffering – it is a rich theological work setting out a variety of perspectives. It has been widely and often extravagantly praised for its literary qualities, with Alfred, Lord Tennyson calling it &quot;the greatest poem of ancient and modern times&quot;.

Some content reflects historical events in ancient Israel such as the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah, the siege of Jerusalem, the Babylonian captivity and the Maccabean Revolt.

The Dead Sea scrolls are thousands of Jewish, predominantly Hebrew manuscripts, dated from the last three centuries BCE and from the first century CE. The texts have great historical, religious, and linguistic significance, because they include the second-oldest known surviving manuscripts of works later included in the Hebrew Bible canon, along with deuterocanonical and extra-biblical manuscripts, which preserve evidence of the diversity of religious and philosophical thought in late Second Temple Judaism. Archaeologists have long associated the scrolls with the ancient Jewish sect called the Essenes, although some recent interpretations have challenged this connection, and argue that priests in Jerusalem, or Zadokites, or other unknown Jewish groups wrote the scrolls.

===Roman Judea===

Post-Biblical Hebrew writings include early rabbinic works of Midrash and Mishnah. The Mishnah is the first major written redaction of the Jewish oral traditions known as the &quot;Oral Torah&quot;. It is also the first major work of Rabbinic literature, written in religious centers such as Yavneh, Lod and Bnei Brak, under the Roman occupation of Judea. It contains the oral traditions of the Pharisees from the Second Temple period particularly the period of the Tannaim. Most of the Mishnah is written in Mishnaic Hebrew, while some parts are in Jewish Aramaic.

The Jewish-Christian movement was formed in Judea of the early first-century. The books of the New Testament were all or nearly all written by Jewish Christians—that is, Jewish disciples of Jesus, during the first and early second centuries Luke, who wrote the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts, is frequently thought of as an exception; scholars are divided as to whether Luke was a Gentile or a Hellenistic Jew. The Gospels were written between 68 and 110 CE, Acts between 95 and 110, Epistles between 51 and 110 CE and Revelation in c. 95 CE.

Josephus was a scholar, historian and hagiographer who was born in 37 CE in Jerusalem, Judea. He recorded Jewish history, with special emphasis on the first century CE and the First Jewish–Roman War, including the Siege of Masada. His most important works were &quot;The Jewish War&quot; ( 75), &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; ( 94) and &quot;Against Apion&quot;. &quot;The Jewish War&quot; recounts the Jewish revolt against Roman occupation (66–70). &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; recounts the history of the world from a Jewish perspective for an ostensibly Roman audience. These works provide valuable insight into first century Judaism and the background of Early Christianity.

===Old Yishuv===

Following the expulsion from Spain and Portugal many Jews settled in the Ottoman Empire including Palestine, contributing greatly to the culture of the Jewish community, especially in literature, poetry, philosophy and mysticism. The city of Safed was a center of a widespread spiritual and mystical activity. Joseph Karo, an author and kabbalist, settled in Safed in 1563. In safed he authored Shulchan Aruch, the most widely consulted of the various legal codes in Judaism. Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz, a kabbalist and poet, settled in 1535 where he composed the Jewish poem Lecha Dodi. Isaac Luria (1534-1572), born in Jerusalem, was a foremost rabbi and Jewish mystic in the community of Safed. He is considered the father of contemporary Kabbalah, his teachings being referred to as Lurianic Kabbalah. The works of his disciples compiled his oral teachings into writing. Every custom of his was scrutinized, and many were accepted, even against previous practice.

Around 1550, Moses ben Jacob Cordovero founded a Kabbalah academy in Safed. Among his disciples were many of the luminaries of Safed, including Rabbi Eliyahu de Vidas, author of Reshit Chochmah (&quot;Beginning of Wisdom&quot;), and Rabbi Chaim Vital, who later became the official recorder and disseminator of the teachings of Rabbi Isaac Luria. Other kabbalists in the Land of Israel at that time were Isaiah Horowitz, Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, Abraham Azulai, Chaim ibn Attar, Shalom Sharabi, Chaim Yosef David Azulai and Abraham Gershon of Kitov.

===Modern Israel===
The first works of Hebrew literature in Israel were written by immigrant authors rooted in the world and traditions of European Jewry. Yosef Haim Brenner (1881–1921) and Shmuel Yosef Agnon (1888–1970), are considered by many to be the fathers of modern Hebrew literature.
Brenner, torn between hope and despair, struggled with the reality of the Zionist enterprise in the Land of Israel. Agnon, Brenner&#x27;s contemporary, fused his knowledge of Jewish heritage with the influence of 19th and early 20th century European literature. He produced fiction dealing with the disintegration of traditional ways of life, loss of faith, and the subsequent loss of identity. In 1966, Agnon was co-recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature.

Native-born writers who published their work in the 1940s and 1950s, often called the &quot;War of Independence generation,&quot; brought a &quot;sabra&quot; mentality and culture to their writing. S. Yizhar, Moshe Shamir, Hanoch Bartov and Benjamin Tammuz vacillated between individualism and commitment to society and state. In the early 1960s, A.B. Yehoshua, Amos Oz, and Yaakov Shabtai broke away from ideologies to focus on the world of the individual, experimenting with narrative forms and writing styles such as psychological realism, allegory, and symbolism.

Since the 1980s and early 1990s, Israeli literature has been widely translated, and several Israeli writers have achieved international recognition.
==Science and technology==
===Ancient Israel===
The early activity in science in ancient Israel can be found in the Hebrew Bible, where some of the books contain descriptions of the physical world. Biblical cosmology provides sporadic glimpses that may be stitched together to form a Biblical impression of the physical universe. There have been comparisons between the Bible, with passages such as from the Genesis creation narrative, and the astronomy of classical antiquity more generally. The Old Testament also contains various cleansing rituals. One suggested ritual, for example, deals with the proper procedure for cleansing a leper (). It is a fairly elaborate process, which is to be performed after a leper was already healed of leprosy (), involving spiritual purity (the concepts of tumah and taharah), extensive physical cleansing, and personal hygiene, but also includes sacrificing a bird and lambs, with the addition of using their blood to symbolize that the afflicted has been cleansed. As with other purification ceremonies described in the Torah, cedar wood and the hyssop herb are also burnt during the ritual.

The Torah proscribes Intercropping (Lev. 19:19, Deut 22:9), a practice often associated with sustainable agriculture and organic farming in modern agricultural science. The Mosaic code has provisions concerning the conservation of natural resources, such as trees () and birds ().

===Modern Israel===


Israel is a developed and highly advanced country and ranks fifth among the most innovative countries in the Bloomberg Innovation Index. Israel counts 140 scientists and technicians per 10,000 employees, one of the highest ratios in the world, and 8,337 full-time equivalent researchers per million inhabitants. It also has one of the highest per capita rates of filed patents. Israel&#x27;s high technology industry has benefited from both the country&#x27;s highly educated and technologically skilled workforce coupled with the strong presence of foreign high-tech firms and sophisticated research centres.

During the 1970s and 1980s Israel began developing the infrastructure needed for research and development in space exploration and related sciences. Israel launched its first satellite, Ofeq-1, from the locally built Shavit launch vehicle on September 19, 1988, and has made important contributions in a number of areas in space research, including laser communication, research into embryo development and osteoporosis in space, pollution monitoring, and mapping geology, soil and vegetation in semi-arid environments. Israel is among the few countries capable of launching satellites into orbit and locally designed and manufactured satellites have been produced and launched by Israel Aerospace Industries(IAI), Israel&#x27;s largest military engineering company, in cooperation with the Israel Space Agency. The AMOS-1 geostationary satellite began operations in 1996 as Israel&#x27;s first commercial communications satellite. It was built primarily for direct-to-home television broadcasting, TV distribution and VSAT services. Further series of AMOS communications satellites (AMOS 2 – 5i) are operated or in development by the Spacecom Satellite Communications company, which provides satellite telecommunications services to countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Israel also develops, manufactures, and exports a large number of related aerospace products, including rockets and satellites, display systems, aeronautical computers, instrumentation systems, drones and flight simulators. Israel&#x27;s second largest defense company is Elbit Systems, which makes electro-optical systems for air, sea and ground forces; drones; control and monitoring systems; communications systems and more.

The growth in agricultural production is based on close cooperation of scientists, farmers and agriculture-related industries and has resulted in the development of advanced agricultural technology, water-conserving irrigation methods, anaerobic digestion, greenhouse technology, desert agriculture and salinity research. Israeli companies also supply irrigation, water conservation and greenhouse technologies and know-how to other countries. The modern technology of drip irrigation was invented in Israel by Simcha Blass and his son Yeshayahu. Their first experimental system was established in 1959 when company called Netafim was established. They developed and patented the first practical surface drip irrigation emitter. This method was very successful and had spread to Australia, North America and South America by the late 1960s.
Israeli companies excel in computer software and hardware development, particularly computer security technologies, semiconductors and communications. Israeli firms include Check Point, a leading firewall firm; Amdocs, which makes business and operations support systems for telecoms; Comverse, a voice-mail company; and Mercury Interactive, which measures software performance. A high concentration of high-tech industries in the coastal plain of Israel has led to the nickname Silicon Wadi (lit: &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;). More than 3,850 start-ups have been established in Israel, making it second only to the US in this sector and has the largest number of NASDAQ-listed companies outside North America. Optics, electro-optics, and lasers are significant fields and Israel produces fiber-optics, electro-optic inspection systems for printed circuit boards, thermal imaging night-vision systems, and electro-optics-based robotic manufacturing systems. Research into robotics first began in the late 1970s, has resulted in the production of robots designed to perform a wide variety of computer aided manufacturing tasks, including diamond polishing, welding, packing, and building. Research is also conducted in the application of artificial intelligence to robots.

Israeli scientists contributed many inventions and discoveries in a variety of fields including Joram Lindenstrauss (Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma); Abraham Fraenkel (Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory); Shimshon Amitsur(Amitsur–Levitzki theorem); Saharon Shelah (Sauer–Shelah lemma); Elon Lindenstrauss (Ergodic theory); Nathan Rosen (Wormhole); Yuval Ne&#x27;eman (prediction of Quarks); Yakir Aharonov and David Bohm (Aharonov–Bohm effect); Jacob Bekenstein (formulation of Black holes Entropy); Dan Shechtman (discovery of quasicrystals); Avram Hershko and Aaron Ciechanover (discovery of the role of protein Ubiquitin); Arieh Warshel and Michael Levitt (development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems); Ariel Rubinstein (Rubinstein bargaining model); Moussa B.H. Youdim (Rasagiline); Robert Aumann (Game theory); Michael O. Rabin (Nondeterministic finite automaton); Amir Pnueli (Temporal logic); Judea Pearl (artificial intelligence); Shafi Goldwasser (Interactive proof system); Asher Peres (Quantum information); Adi Shamir (RSA, Differential cryptanalysis, Shamir&#x27;s Secret Sharing); Yaakov Ziv and Abraham Lempel (Lempel–Ziv–Welch); Notable inventions include ReWalk, Given Imaging, Eshkol-Wachman movement notation, Taliglucerase alfa, USB flash drive, Intel 8088, Projection keyboard, TDMoIP, Mobileye, Waze, Wix.com, Gett, Viber, Uzi, Iron Dome, Arrow missile, Super-iron battery, Epilator.
==Visual arts==
From the beginning of the 20th century, visual arts in Israel have shown a creative orientation, influenced both by the West and East, as well as by the land itself, its development, the character of the cities, and stylistic trends emanating from art centers abroad. In painting, sculpture, photography, and other art forms, the country&#x27;s varied landscape is the protagonist: the hill terraces and ridges produce special dynamics of line and shape; the foothills of the Negev, the prevailing grayish-green vegetation, and the clear luminous light result in distinctive color effects; and the sea and sand affect surfaces. On the whole, local landscapes, concerns, and politics lie at the center of Israeli art, and ensure its uniqueness.

The earliest Israeli art movement was the Bezalel school of the Ottoman and early Mandate period, when artists portrayed both Biblical and Zionist subjects in a style influenced by the European &quot;Art Nouveau&quot; movement, symbolism, and traditional Persian, Jewish, and Syrian artistry.

During the 1920s, the art scene saw a drastic shift with the growing influence of modern European art, chief among them the influence of the French Ecole de Paris on the Yishuv. Yitzhak Frenkel Frenel was the heralder of this movement and the first to teach in a modern style akin to the manner in France. The first abstract painter in Israel, he opened the Histadrut Art Studio in Tel Aviv (1926-1929). Artists that learned under Frenkel such as Moshe Castel, Shimshon Holzman and others would venture to Paris themselves and return, increasing the influence of Paris on the early Israeli art scene. At the same time, the Israeli art scene shifted from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv. The latter, which became the center of Hebrew literature and theatre, was also the new center of modern art in the country (this expressed itself in the opening of Frenkel&#x27;s art studio in Tel Aviv, as well as modern art exhibitions such as the Ohel&#x27;s Modern Artists Exhibition). 

The city of Safed had a vibrant artists&#x27; quarter due to Safed&#x27;s artistic appeal, drawing painters from all art movements to Safed during the summer up until the late 70s. Today Israeli artists have ventured into Optical Art, digital art, AI art and more. Israel also has a vibrant street art scene; southern Tel Aviv is a hotspot of street Art culture.

== Symbols ==
Jewish various symbols are omnipresent in the culture of Israel. The Jewish diversity of Israel enrich the culture with a variety of traditions, symbols and handicrafts.

The national symbols of Israel are influenced by Jewish symbols and Jewish history to represent the country and its people.

==Performance art==

===Music===
Classical music in Israel has been vibrant since the 1930s, when hundreds of music teachers and students, composers, instrumentalists and singers, as well as thousands of music lovers, streamed into the country, driven by the threat of Nazism in Europe. Israel is also home to several world-class classical music ensembles, such as the Israel Philharmonic and the New Israeli Opera. The founding of The Palestine Philharmonic Orchestra (today the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra) in 1936 marked the beginning of Israel&#x27;s classical music scene. In the early 1980s, the New Israeli Opera began staging productions, reviving public enthusiasm for operatic works. Russian immigration in the 1990s boosted the classical music arena with new talents, and music lovers.

The modern music scene in Israel spans the spectrum of musical genres, and often fuses many musical influences, ranging from Ethiopian, Middle-Eastern soul, rock, jazz, hip-hop, electronic, Arabic, pop and mainstream. Israeli music is versatile, and combines elements of both western and eastern music. It tends to be very eclectic, and contains a wide variety of influences from the Diaspora, as well as more modern cultural importations: Hassidic songs, Asian pop, Arab folk (especially by Yemenite singers), and Israeli hip hop or heavy metal. Also popular are various forms of electronic music, including trance, Hard trance, and Goa trance. Notable artists from Israel in this field are few, but include the psychedelic trance duo Infected Mushroom.

===Dance===
Traditional folk dances of Israel include the &quot;Horah&quot; and dances incorporating the Tza’ad Temani. Israeli folk dancing today is choreographed for recreational and performance dance groups.

Modern dance in Israel has won international acclaim. Israeli choreographers, among them Ohad Naharin and Barak Marshall, are considered among the most versatile and original international creators working today. Notable Israeli dance companies include the Batsheva Dance Company, the Kibbutz Contemporary Dance Company, the Inbal Pinto &amp; Avshalom Pollak Dance Company and the Kamea Dance Company. People come from all over Israel and many other nations for the annual dance festival in Karmiel, held in July. First held in 1988, the Karmiel Dance Festival is the largest celebration of dance in Israel, featuring three or four days and nights of dancing, with 5,000 or more dancers and a quarter of a million spectators in the capital of Galilee. Begun as an Israeli folk dance event, the festivities now include performances, workshops, and open dance sessions for a variety of dance forms and nationalities. Choreographer Yonatan Karmon created the Karmiel Dance Festival to continue the tradition of Gurit Kadman&#x27;s Dalia Festival of Israeli dance, which ended in the 1960s.

Famous companies and choreographers from all over the world have come to Israel to perform and give master classes. In July 2010, Mikhail Baryshnikov came to perform in Israel.

===Theatre===
====Roman Judea====
During the Roman rule, some theaters were built in Judea, located in places such as Caesarea, Beth Shean and Jerusalem. The theater in Caesarea Maritima was built by Herod the Great and had a seating capacity of about 4000 seats in its final stage. Another theater, in Bet Shean, was built in the end of the 2nd century CE with a capacity of 7000 seats.

====Modern Israel====

The emergence of Hebrew theatre predated the state by nearly 50 years. The first amateur Hebrew theatre group was active in Ottoman Palestine from 1904 to 1914. The first professional Hebrew theatre, Habimah, was founded in Moscow in 1917, and moved to British Mandatory Palestine in 1931, where it became the country&#x27;s national theatre. The Ohel Theater was founded in 1925 as a workers&#x27; theatre that explored socialist and biblical themes. The first Hebrew plays revolved around pioneering.

After 1948, two major motifs were the Holocaust and the Arab-Israeli conflict. Moshe Shamir&#x27;s &quot;He Walked in the Fields&quot; in 1949 was the first produced by a &quot;sabra&quot; writing about &quot;sabras&quot; in idiomatic and contemporary Hebrew. In the 1950s, dramatists portrayed the gap between pre-state dreams and disillusionment. Other plays pitted native Israelis against Holocaust survivors. Beginning in the 1960s, Hanoch Levin wrote 56 plays and political satires. During the 1970s, Israeli theatre became more critical, contrasting extreme images of Israeli identity, such as the muscleman and the spiritual Jew. In the 1980s, Joshua Sobol explored Israeli-Jewish identity issues. Today, Israeli theatre is extremely diverse in content and style, and half of all plays are local productions.

Other major theatre companies include the Cameri Theatre, Beit Lessin Theater, Gesher Theater (which performs in Hebrew and Russian), Haifa Theatre and Beersheba Theater.

Founded in 1980, The Acco Festival of Alternative Israeli Theatre is a four-day performing arts festival held annually in early autumn at the city of Acre. the festival became a symbol of coexistence between the city&#x27;s Jewish and Arab inhabitants.

===Cinema===
Filmmaking in Israel has undergone major developments since its inception in the 1950s. The first features produced and directed by Israelis, such as &quot;Hill 24 Doesn&#x27;t Answer&quot; and &quot;They Were Ten&quot;, tended, like Israeli literature of the period, to be cast in the heroic mold. Some recent films remain deeply rooted in the Israeli experience, dealing with such subjects as Holocaust survivors and their children (Gila Almagor&#x27;s &quot;The Summer of Aviya&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Under the Domim Tree&quot;) and the travails of new immigrants (&quot;Sh&#x27;hur&quot;, directed by Hannah Azoulai and Shmuel Hasfari, &quot;Late Marriage&quot; directed by Dover Koshashvili).
Others deal with issues of modern-day Israeli life, such as the Israeli-Arab conflict (Eran Riklis&#x27;s &quot;The Lemon Tree&quot;, Scandar Copti and Yaron Shani&#x27;s &quot;Ajami&quot;) and military service (Joseph Cedar&#x27;s &quot;Beaufort&quot;, Samuel Maoz&#x27;s &quot;Lebanon&quot;, Eytan Fox&#x27;s &quot;Yossi and Jagger&quot;). Some are set in the context of a universalist, alienated, and hedonistic society (Eytan Fox&#x27;s &quot;A Siren&#x27;s Song&quot; and &quot;The Bubble&quot;, Ayelet Menahemi and Nirit Yaron&#x27;s &quot;Tel Aviv Stories&quot;).

The Israeli film industry continues to gain worldwide recognition through International awards nominations. For three years consecutively, Israeli films (&quot;Beaufort&quot; (2008), &quot;Waltz with Bashir&quot; (2009) and &quot;Ajami&quot; (2010)) were nominated for Academy Awards. The Spielberg Film Archive at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem is the world&#x27;s largest repository of film material on Jewish themes as well as on Jewish and Israeli life.

The main international film festivals in Israel are the Jerusalem Film Festival and Haifa Film Festival.

==Museums==
With over 200 museums, Israel has the highest number of museums per capita in the world, with millions of visitors annually.

Jerusalem&#x27;s Israel Museum has a special pavilion showcasing the Dead Sea scrolls and a large collection of Jewish religious art, Israeli art, sculptures and Old Masters paintings. Newspapers appear in dozens of languages, and every city and town publishes a local newsletter.

== Architecture==
The old town of cities in Israel are composed of a variety of architectural styles, which is reflected in the synagogue architecture of Jewish quarters.

After 1850, the Jewish architecture began to open up to European influences, and tried to restore an ancient Biblical architecture. Notably, Mishkenot Sha&#x27;ananim was built, with inspiration from Mediterranean architecture. Until the 1920s, most structures are built in eclectic style and later, Modern architecture is further developed, notably in the &quot;White City&quot;, known for its International Style.

The rural architecture of communities of kibbutzim and moshavim consist of small, white-walled houses with red roofs, and are a symbol of Israel.

==Cuisine==

The heterogeneous nature of culture in Israel is also manifested in Israeli cuisine, a diverse combination of local ingredients and dishes, with diasporic dishes from around the world. An Israeli fusion cuisine has developed, with the adoption and continued adaption of elements of various Jewish styles of cuisine including Mizrahi, Sephardic, Yemenite Jewish and Ashkenazi, and many foods traditionally eaten in the Middle East. Israeli cuisine is also influenced by geography, giving prominence to foods common in the Mediterranean region such as olives, chickpeas, dairy products, fish, and fresh fruits and vegetables. The main meal is usually lunch rather than dinner. Jewish holidays influence the cuisine, with many traditional foods served at holiday times. Shabbat dinner, eaten on Friday night, is a significant meal in a large proportion of Israeli homes. While not all Jews in Israel keep kosher, the observance of kashrut influences the menu in homes, public institutions and many restaurants.

In 2013, an Israeli cookbook, &quot;Seafoodpedia&quot;, won &quot;Best in World&quot; in its category at the Gourmand World Cookbook Award in Paris, and &quot;&quot;, published by the Israeli-Palestinian team of Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi, won &quot;Best in the World&quot; for Mediterranean Cuisine.

==Fashion==

Israel has become an international center of fashion and design. Tel Aviv has been called the “next hot destination” for fashion. Israeli designers, such as swimwear company Gottex, show their collections at leading fashion shows, including New York&#x27;s Bryant Park fashion show. In 2011, Tel Aviv hosted its first Fashion Week since the 1980s, with Italian designer Roberto Cavalli as a guest of honor.

==Sports==


Physical fitness received a boost in the 19th century from the physical culture campaign of Max Nordau. The Maccabiah Games, an Olympic-style event for Jewish athletes, was inaugurated in the 1930s, and has been held in Israel every four years since then.

In 1964, Israel hosted and won the AFC Asian Cup; in 1970, the Israel national football team managed to qualify to the FIFA World Cup, which is still considered the biggest achievement in Israeli football. Israel was excluded from the 1978 Asian Games due to Arab pressure, and since 1994 all Israeli sporting organizations now compete in Europe.

Football (soccer) and basketball are the most popular sports in Israel. The Israeli Premier League is the country&#x27;s premier soccer league, and &quot;Ligat ha&#x27;Al&quot; is the premier basketball league. Maccabi Haifa, Maccabi Tel Aviv, Hapoel Tel Aviv and Beitar Jerusalem are the largest sports clubs. Maccabi Tel Aviv, Maccabi Haifa, and Hapoel Tel Aviv have competed in the UEFA Champions League, and Hapoel Tel Aviv reached the Quarterfinal in the UEFA Cup. Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C. has won the European Championship in basketball six times. Israeli tennis champion Shahar Pe&#x27;er peaked at 11th on the WTA rank list, a national record. Beersheba has become a national chess center; as a result of Soviet immigration, it is home to the largest number of chess grandmasters of any city in the world. The city hosted the World Team Chess Championship in 2005. Israeli chess teams won the silver medal at the 2008 Chess Olympiad and the bronze medal at the 2010 Chess Olympiad. Israeli Grandmaster Boris Gelfand won the Chess World Cup 2009, and played for the World Champion title in the World Chess Championship 2012.

To date, Israel has won seven Olympic medals since its first win in 1992, including a gold medal in windsurfing at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Israel has won over 100 gold medals in the Paralympic Games, and is ranked about 15th in the All-time Paralympic Games medal table. The 1968 Summer Paralympics were hosted by Israel.

==Youth movements==

Youth movements were an important feature of Israel from its earliest days. In the 1950s, these movements were categorized in three groups: Zionist youth groups promoting social ideals and the importance of agricultural and communal settlement; working youth promoting educational goals and occupational advancement; and recreational groups with a strong emphasis on sports and leisure-time activities.

==Outdoor and vacation culture==

Hiking in Israel, named &quot;tiyul&quot;, has been an integral part of Israeli culture, representing the Sabra ethos. First practiced by Zionist pioneers as a way to bond to the Land of Israel, it had become charged with much cultural significance. Activities such as hiking during Jewish holidays (particularly Tu Bishvat) or backpacking on the Israel National trail, are part of israeli nationhood, culture, and history. National parks and nature reserves across Israel register some 6.5 million visits a year. Schools and youth groups are taken on annual hiking trips throughout the country, raising children with an affinity for hiking and other outdoor activities. Consequently, many young Israelis take several months to a year off to travel the world, primarily to hike and experience the outdoors in remote, mountainous areas, such as Nepal, India, China, Chile, and Peru.

Along the of the Israeli Mediterranean coast, two thirds are accessible to bathing activities. Israel has 100 surf bathing beaches, guarded by professional lifeguards. &quot;Matkot&quot; is a popular paddle ball game similar to beach tennis, often referred to as the country&#x27;s national sport.

==Wedding customs==
All marriages between Jews in Israel are registered with the Chief Rabbinate, and the ceremony follows traditional Jewish practice. Civil ceremonies are not performed in Israel, although a growing number of secular couples circumvent this by traveling to nearby locations, such as Cyprus. While some Jews in Israel have adopted Western styles of dress, traditional clothing and jewelry are sometimes brought out for pre-wedding rituals, including the Night of the Henna, which is a customary practice among Mizrahi Jews.

<text>Matthew Saad Muhammad (born Maxwell Antonio Loach; June 16, 1954 – May 25, 2014) was an American professional boxer who was the WBC Light Heavyweight Champion of the World for two-and-a-half years.

==Background==
Saad Muhammad&#x27;s mother died when he was an infant, and he and his elder brother were sent to live with an aunt. When he was five, his aunt could not afford to look after both of them and she instructed his brother to get rid of him. His brother took him to Philadelphia&#x27;s Benjamin Franklin Parkway and then ran away. Saad was found in the early hours asleep on the steps of a church. He was then taken in by Catholic Social Services. The nuns gave him the name Matthew Franklin (after the saint and the parkway where he was found). Matthew lived in foster care until a couple from Philadelphia adopted him, raised him, and took care of him like he was their own.

Saad Muhammad was very popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s among boxing fans because of his particularly action-oriented style. Saad Muhammad was known for his ability to take punishment and mount comebacks, and because of this, he was nicknamed Miracle Matthew.

Saad Muhammad was also part of a group of world light heavyweight champions who became Muslims and changed their names during his era as a Light-Heavyweight, the others being Eddie Mustafa Muhammad (born as Eddie Gregory), and Dwight Muhammad Qawi (born as Dwight Braxton). Saad Muhammad confirmed this in interviews following his boxing career, stating that he was inspired to convert by Muhammad Ali&#x27;s conversion.

==Amateur career==
Saad Muhammad had a relatively short amateur career, consisting of only 20 amateur bouts. He won the Trenton (NJ) Golden Gloves in 1973 and turned pro the following year.

==Professional boxing career==
Saad Muhammad began to box professionally in 1974, winning his first fight with a second-round knockout win against Billy Early. He posted seven more wins that year before suffering his first loss at the hands of Wayne McGee by a decision in six rounds.

In 1975, after two wins, he and McGee fought again, in a six-round draw. In 1976, he had two matches each with future world champions Marvin Camel and Mate Parlov.

His first fight with Parlov, in Milan, was also his first fight abroad. He beat Parlov in an eight-round decision. He then beat Camel in a ten-round decision, but lost the rematch, also in a ten-round decision. He returned to Italy for a rematch with Parlov, which resulted in a ten-round draw.

Saad Muhammad began 1977 by losing to Mustafa Muhammad (then Edward Lee Gregory), but then defeated the future three-time world champion Marvin Johnson by a knockout in round 12 for the United States Light-Heavyweight title in his first nationally televised match.

In 1978, he won all four of his bouts, including successful defenses of his title against former world title challenger Richie Kates and against four-time world title challenger Yaqui López. The Lopez fight, their first of two, was considered a classic by boxing experts, Saad Muhammad surviving a relentless attack by López to score an 11th-round knockout.

In 1979, after Johnson became world champion by defeating Parlov, he and Saad Muhammad met again on April 22 in Johnson&#x27;s hometown of Indianapolis for the WBC&#x27;s world light heavyweight crown . In a fight considered by many experts as a &quot;Saad Muhammad classic&quot;, and which subsequently featured on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Classic Fights&quot; show, Saad Muhammad won with an eight-round knockout after staggering Johnson towards the end of the seventh round. Shortly afterward, he converted to Islam and changed his name to Matthew Saad Muhammad.

In his first title defense, Saad Muhammad met former world champion John Conteh in Atlantic City. He retained the world title with a 15-round decision. The decision, however, was voided and a rematch ordered because Muhammad&#x27;s cornermen used an illegal substance to stop the bleeding from a cut. Muhammad retained the crown with a knockout in round four in the second bout. After defeating Louis Pergaud, he and López met again, this time, with the world title on the line. Their rematch has also been shown by ESPN&#x27;s &quot;classic&quot; network several times, it was the &quot;fight of the year&quot; for 1980, according to &quot;Ring Magazine&quot;, and is still written about by boxing aficionados. Saad Muhammad was hit with 20 &quot;unanswered&quot; blows in round eight, but he recovered and dropped López five times en route to a 14th-round knockout win. &quot;This was my toughest fight,&quot; said Saad Muhammad of the fight, which some consider the closest López ever came to a world title.

He then went on to defeat Lottie Mwale, Vonzell Johnson, future world Super-Middleweight champion Murray Sutherland and Jerry Martin, all in defense of his world title, before losing to Dwight Muhammad Qawi in December 1981. In yet another fight that would later be shown on ESPN&#x27;s classic network, Saad Muhammad lost his title when Qawi knocked him out in 10 rounds.

Saad Muhammad entered 1982 with a rematch against Qawi within his sights, and he defeated Pete McIntyre by a knockout in round two. The rematch between Saad Muhammad and Qawi came off in August, at Saad Muhammad&#x27;s hometown of Philadelphia. The second time around, Qawi won by a knockout in round six.

From there on until 1992, Saad Muhammad fought sporadically and with limited success. He had been confronting vision problems, and in 1986, he declared himself in bankruptcy.

After he lost the rematch to Qawi fought in Australia, Spain, The Bahamas and Trinidad and Tobago.

===MMA career===
Saad Muhammad also took a turn in the forerunner of mixed martial arts in Japan, participating in the first UWF International (UWFi) event in 1991. Matched against Kiyoshi Tamura, Saad Muhammad talked a great deal at a lead-in press conference. He declined to say in which round he would knock Tamura out, but guaranteed a victory. Tamura submitted Saad Muhammad 34 seconds into the first round.

==Retirement from boxing==

Saad Muhammad retired from professional boxing with a record of 39 wins, 16 losses and 3 draws, with 29 wins by knockout.

In 1998, he became a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Boxing trainer==
Muhammad trained up and coming fighters out of Atlantic City, New Jersey and worked closely with former Indian Olympic boxing team heavyweight Gurcharan &quot;The Guru&quot; Singh.

==Retirement and death==
In July 2010, Saad Muhammad was homeless and living in a shelter in Philadelphia. He later became involved in charity work in the Philadelphia area, some of which focused on raising money for the homeless.
He died at a hospital in Philadelphia on May 25, 2014; his cause of death was unknown, though he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Muhammad was listed as number 24 on &quot;Ring Magazine&quot; list of 100 greatest punchers of all time.

<text>The Canon Court de 105 M(montagne) modèle 1919 Schneider (105 mm mle.19) was a French mountain gun produced by Schneider and intended to be used in conjunction with the 75 mm mle.19 that was used by a number of countries during World War II. 

==Design==

The modèle 1919 was built from steel and had two spoked wheels, interrupted screw breech, hydro-pneumatic recoil system, box trail carriage and a rounded gun shield to protect the crew. For transport, this gun could be broken down into 8 sections, the barrel could be dismantled into 2 sections. A latter variant called the Canon Court de 105 M(montagne) modèle 1928 Schneider was produced in 1928. The modèle 1928 can be identified by its squared off gun shield and may have had a sprung axle and pneumatic tires for motor traction.

==Users==
* 
* - Captured French guns were given the designations &quot;10.5 cm le.GebH 322(f)&quot; for modèle 1919 guns and &quot;10.5 cm le.GebH 323(f)&quot; for modèle 1928 guns in German service.
*

<doc id="211855" wikidata="Q1381" url="?curid=211855" title="Dave Arneson">
<text>David Lance Arneson (; October 1, 1947 – April 7, 2009) was an American game designer best known for co-developing the first published role-playing game (RPG), &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, with Gary Gygax, in the early 1970s. Arneson&#x27;s fundamental early role-playing game (RPG) genre work pioneered now-archetypical devices, such as: cooperative play to develop a storyline instead of individual competitive play to &quot;win&quot;; and adventuring in dungeon, town, and wilderness settings as presented by a neutral judge who doubles as the voice and consciousness of all characters aside from the player characters.

Arneson discovered wargaming as a teenager in the 1960s, and he began combining these games with the concept of role-playing. He was a University of Minnesota student when he met Gygax at the Gen Con gaming convention in the late 1960s. In 1971, Arneson created the game and fictional world that became &quot;Blackmoor&quot;, writing his own rules and basing the setting on medieval fantasy elements. Arneson took the game to Gygax as the representative for game publisher Guidon Games, and the pair co-developed a set of rules that became &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;). Gygax and Donald Kaye subsequently founded Tactical Studies Rules in 1973, which published &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; the next year. 

Arneson moved to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin to work for TSR Hobbies in 1976, but left before the end of the year. In 1979 Arneson filed suit to retain credits and royalties on the game. He continued to work as an independent game designer, including work submitted to TSR in the 1980s, and continued to play games for his entire life. Arneson also did some work in computer programming, and he taught computer game design and game rules design at Full Sail University from the 1990s until shortly before his death in 2009.

==Experience with miniature wargaming==
Arneson&#x27;s role-playing game design work grew from his interest in wargames. His parents bought him the board wargame &quot;Gettysburg&quot; by Avalon Hill. After Arneson taught his friends how to play, the group began to design their own games, and tried out new ways to play existing games. Arneson was especially fond of naval wargames. Exposure to role-playing influenced his later game designs. In college history classes he role-played historical events and preferred to deviate from recorded history in a manner similar to &quot;what if&quot; scenarios recreated in wargames.

In the late 1960s Arneson joined the Twin Cities Military Miniatures Group, a group of miniature wargamers and military figurine collectors in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area that included among its ranks future game designer David Wesely. Wesely asserts that it was during the &quot;Braunstein&quot; games he created and refereed, and in which other Twin Cities Military Miniatures Group members participated, that Arneson helped develop the foundations of modern role-playing games on a 1:1 scale basis by focusing on non-combat objectives—a step away from wargaming towards the more individual play and varied challenges of later RPGs. Arneson was a participant in Wesely&#x27;s wargame scenarios and, as Arneson continued to run his own scenarios, he eventually began to include ideas from sources such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. Arneson took over the Braunsteins after Wesely was drafted into the Army, and he often ran these scenarios using different eras and settings. Arneson had also become a member of the International Federation of Wargamers by this time.

In 1969 Arneson was a history student attending the University of Minnesota and working part-time as a security guard. He attended the second Gen Con gaming convention in August 1969 (at which time wargaming was still the primary focus) and it was at this event that he met Gary Gygax, who had founded the Castle &amp; Crusade Society within the International Federation of Wargamers in the 1960s at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. Arneson and Gygax also shared an interest in sailing ship games and they co-authored the &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up the Ship&quot; naval battle rules, serialized from June 1971 and later published as a single volume in 1972 by Guidon Games with a revised edition by TSR Hobbies in 1975.

==Blackmoor==
Following the departure of David Wesely to service in the Army Reserves in October 1970, Arneson and his fellow players in the Twin Cities began to imagine alternate settings for &quot;Braunstein&quot; games. Arneson developed a Braunstein in which his players played fantasy versions of themselves in the medieval Barony of Blackmoor, a land inhabited in part by fantastic monsters. As the game quickly grew and characters developed, Arneson devised scenarios where they would quest for magic and gold, escort caravans, lead armies for or against the forces of evil, and delve into the dungeons beneath Castle Blackmoor (which was represented by a Kibri kit model of Branzoll Castle). To explain his inspiration for the game, Arneson said:

Arneson drew heavily upon the fantasy material in the &quot;Chainmail&quot; rules, written by Gygax and Jeff Perren and published in the spring of 1971, but after a short and unsatisfactory trial of the Fantasy Combat table found therein, he developed his own mix of rules, including adapted elements from his revision of Civil War Ironclad game. The gameplay would be recognizable to modern &quot;D&amp;D&quot; players, featuring the use of hit points, armor class, character development, and dungeon crawls. This setting was fleshed out over time and continues to be played to the present day.

Many of the fantasy medieval foundations of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, as well as the concept of adventuring in &quot;dungeons&quot; originated with &quot;Blackmoor&quot;, which also incorporated time travel and science fiction elements. These are visible much later in the DA module series published by TSR (particularly &quot;City of the Gods&quot;), but were also present from the early to mid-1970s in the original campaign and parallel and intertwined games run by John Snider, whose ruleset developed from these adventures and was intended for publication by TSR from 1974 as the first science fiction RPG. Arneson described &quot;Blackmoor&quot; as &quot;roleplaying in a non-traditional medieval setting. I have such things as steam power, gunpowder, and submarines in limited numbers. There was even a tank running around for a while. The emphasis is on the story and the roleplaying.&quot; Details of &quot;Blackmoor&quot; and the original campaign, established on the map of the Castle &amp; Crusade Society&#x27;s &quot;Great Kingdom&quot;, were first brought to print briefly in issue #13 of the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, the newsletter of the Castle &amp; Crusade Society in July 1972, and later in much-expanded form as &quot;The First Fantasy Campaign&quot;, published by Judges Guild in 1977.

In November 1972, Dave Arneson and Dave Megarry traveled to Lake Geneva to meet with Gary Gygax, to provide a demonstration of &quot;Blackmoor&quot; and &quot;Dungeon!&quot; While meeting at Gygax&#x27;s house, Dave Arneson ran the Lake Geneva gamers through their first session of &quot;Blackmoor&quot;. Rob Kuntz describes Dave Arneson as the referee, and the Lake Geneva players as being Gary Gygax, Ernie Gygax, Terry Kuntz, and himself. Kuntz describes Dave Megarry as the de facto leader of the group, as he understood the &quot;Blackmoor&quot; game and campaign world. In &quot;Wargaming&quot; magazine, Rob Kuntz wrote a short summary of their first &quot;Blackmoor&quot; session:

==&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;==
After playing in the &quot;Blackmoor&quot; game Arneson refereed, Gygax almost immediately began a similar campaign of his own, which he called &quot;Greyhawk&quot;, and asked Arneson for a draft of his playing-rules. The two then collaborated by phone and mail, and playtesting was carried out by their various groups and other contacts. Gygax and Arneson wanted to have the game published, but Guidon Games and Avalon Hill rejected it. Arneson could not afford to invest in the venture.

Gygax felt that there was a need to publish the game as soon as possible, since similar projects were being planned elsewhere, so rules were hastily put together, and Arneson&#x27;s own final draft was never used. Despite all this, Brian Blume eventually provided the funding required to publish the original &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; set in 1974, with the initial print run of 1,000 selling out within a year and sales increasing rapidly in subsequent years. Further rules and a sample dungeon from Arneson&#x27;s original campaign (the first published RPG scenario in a professional publication) were released in 1975 in the &quot;Blackmoor&quot; supplement for &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, named after the campaign-setting. &quot;Blackmoor&quot; presented new character classes for monks and assassins, additional new monsters, and &quot;The Temple of the Frog&quot;, the first published role-playing adventure scenario intended for other people to run.

Arneson formally joined TSR as their Director of Research at the beginning of 1976, but left at the end of the year to pursue a career as an independent game-designer.

==After TSR==
In 1977, despite the fact that he was no longer at TSR, Arneson published &quot;Dungeonmaster&#x27;s Index&quot;, a 38-page booklet that indexed all of TSR&#x27;s &quot;D&amp;D&quot; properties to that point in time.

TSR had agreed to pay Arneson royalties on all &quot;D&amp;D&quot; products, but when the company came out with &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;AD&amp;D&quot;) in 1977, it claimed that &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; was a significantly different product and so did not pay him royalties for it. In response, Arneson filed the first of five lawsuits against Gygax and TSR in 1979. In March 1981, as part of a confidential agreement, Arneson and Gygax resolved the suits out of court by agreeing that they would both be credited as &quot;co-creators&quot; on the packaging of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; products from that point on, and Arneson would receive a 2.5% royalty on all &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; products. This provided him with a comfortable six-figure annual income for the next twenty years. This did not end the lingering tensions between them.

==Continuation of Blackmoor==
Arneson wrote a new version of the Blackmoor setting for publication by Judges Guild in &quot;The First Fantasy Campaign&quot; (1977). In 1979 Arneson and Richard L. Snider, an original &quot;Blackmoor&quot; player, co-authored &quot;Adventures in Fantasy&quot;, a role-playing game that attempted to recapture the &quot;original spirit of the Role Playing Fantasy Game&quot; that Arneson had envisioned in the early 1970s, instead of what &quot;D&amp;D&quot; had become. In the early 1980s he established his own game company, Adventure Games – staffed largely by Arneson&#x27;s friends, most of whom were involved in an American Civil War reenactment group – that published the miniatures games &quot;Harpoon&quot; (1981) and &quot;Johnny Reb&quot; (1983), as well as a new edition of his own &quot;Adventures in Fantasy&quot; role-playing game (1981). The company also published several Tékumel related books, owing to Arneson&#x27;s friendship with author M. A. R. Barker. Adventure Games was profitable, but Arneson found the workload to be excessive and finally sold the company to Flying Buffalo. Arneson sold the rights to Adventure Games to Flying Buffalo in 1985; because Arneson owned part of Flying Buffalo, he wanted to let them handle the rest of his company&#x27;s stock and intellectual property after shutting down Adventure Games.

While Gary Gygax was president of TSR in the mid-1980s, he and Arneson reconnected, and Arneson briefly relinked &quot;Blackmoor&quot; to &quot;D&amp;D&quot; with the &quot;DA&quot; (Dave Arneson) series of modules set in Blackmoor (1986–1987). The four modules in the series, three of which were written by Arneson, detailed Arneson&#x27;s campaign setting for the first time. When Gygax was forced out of TSR, Arneson&#x27;s projects were dropped from the company before a planned fifth module could be published. Gygax and Arneson again went their separate ways. In 1986 Arneson wrote a new &quot;D&amp;D&quot; module set in Blackmoor called &quot;The Garbage Pits of Despair&quot;, which was published in two parts in &quot;Different Worlds&quot; magazine issues #42 and #43.

Arneson and Dustin Clingman founded Zeitgeist Games to produce an updated d20 System version of the &quot;Blackmoor&quot; setting. Goodman Games published and distributed &quot;Dave Arneson&#x27;s Blackmoor&quot; in 2004, and Goodman published additional products for Blackmoor over the next year. Code Monkey Publishing released &quot;Dave Arneson&#x27;s Blackmoor: The First Campaign&quot; (2009) for 4th edition &quot;D&amp;D&quot;.

==Computer programming and education==
In 1988, Arneson stated his belief that RPGs, whether paper or computer, were still &quot;hack and slash&quot; and did not teach novices how to play, and that games like &quot;Ultima IV&quot; &quot;have stood pretty much alone as quirks instead of trend setters&quot; as others did not follow their innovations. He hoped that computer RPGs would teach newcomers how to role play while offering interesting campaigns and said that SSI&#x27;s Gold Box games did not innovate on the genre as much as he had hoped. Arneson stepped into the computer industry and founded 4D Interactive Systems, a computer company in Minnesota that has since dissolved. He also did some computer programming and worked on several games. He eventually found himself consulting with computer companies. Arneson wrote the 1989 adventure &quot;DNA / DOA&quot;, the first adventure published for the FASA fantasy/cyberpunk game &quot;Shadowrun&quot;, which was released the same year.

Living in California in the late 1980s, Arneson had a chance to work with special education children. Upon returning to Minnesota, he pursued teaching and began speaking at schools about educational uses of role-playing and using multi-sided dice to teach math.

In the 1990s, he began working at Full Sail, a private university that teaches multimedia subjects, and continued there as an instructor of computer game design until 2008. At Full Sail University he taught the class &quot;Rules of the Game&quot;, a class in which students learned how to accurately document and create rule sets for games that were balanced between mental challenges for the players and &quot;physical&quot; ones for the characters. He retired from the position on June 19, 2008.

==Other RPG involvements==
Arneson continued to play games his entire life, including &quot;D&amp;D&quot; and military miniature games, and regularly attended an annual meeting to play the original &quot;Blackmoor&quot; in Minnesota.

Arneson wrote for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; magazine in the 1980s and early 1990s. He wrote columns on his opinion of the role-playing game genre and reviews of computer games such as &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (1985), &quot;Zork Zero&quot; (1988), &quot;&quot; (1989), &quot;Uncharted Waters&quot; (1990), and &quot;Renegade Legion: Interceptor&quot; (1990).

During the 1990s, he was invited to Brazil by Devir, a game publisher. He became friends with the owner of the publishing company and he gave him his D&amp;D woodgrain box and some of his books as a gift.

In 1997, after Wizards of the Coast purchased TSR, Peter Adkison paid Arneson an undisclosed sum to free up &quot;D&amp;D&quot; from royalties that were still owed to Arneson; this allowed Wizards to retitle &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; to simply &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

Around 2000, Arneson was working with videographer John Kentner on &quot;Dragons in the Basement&quot; (unreleased), a video documentary on the early history of role-playing games. Arneson describes the documentary: &quot;Basically it is a series of interviews with original players (&#x27;How did &quot;D&amp;D&quot; affect your life?&#x27;) and original RPG designers like Marc Miller (&quot;Traveller&quot;) and M.A.R. Barker (&quot;Empire of the Petal Throne&quot;).&quot; He also made a cameo appearance in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; movie as one of many mages throwing fireballs at a dragon, although the scene was deleted from the completed movie.

==Personal life==
Arneson married Frankie Ann Morneau in 1984; they had one daughter, Malia, and two grandchildren.

Arneson died on April 7, 2009, after battling cancer for two years. According to his daughter, Malia Weinhagen, &quot;The biggest thing about my dad&#x27;s world is he wanted people to have fun in life.&quot;

==Honors and tributes==
Arneson received numerous industry awards for his part in creating &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and other role-playing games. In 1984 he was inducted into the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design&#x27;s Hall of Fame (also known as the Charles Roberts Awards Hall of Fame) and in 1999 was named by &quot;Pyramid&quot; magazine as one of &quot;The Millennium&#x27;s Most Influential Persons&quot;, &quot;at least in the realm of adventure gaming&quot;. He was honored as a &quot;famous game designer&quot; by being featured on the king of hearts in Flying Buffalo&#x27;s 2008 Famous Game Designers Playing Card Deck.

Three days after his death, Wizards of the Coast temporarily replaced the front page of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; section of their web site with a tribute to Arneson. Other tributes in the gaming world included &quot;Order of the Stick&quot; #644, and &quot;Dork Tower&quot; for April 8, 2009. Video game publisher Activision Blizzard posted a tribute to Arneson on their website and on April 14, 2009, released patch 3.1 of the online role-playing game &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, &quot;The Secrets of Ulduar&quot;, dedicated to Arneson.

Turbine&#x27;s &quot;Dungeons and Dragons Online&quot; added an in-game memorial altar to Arneson in the Ruins of Threnal location in the game. They also created an in-game item named the &quot;Mantle of the Worldshaper&quot; that is a reward for finishing the Threnal quest chain that is narrated by Arneson himself. The Mantle&#x27;s description reads: &quot;A comforting and inspiring presence surrounds you as you hold this cloak. Arcane runes run along the edges of the fine cape, and masterfully drawn on the silken lining is an incredibly detailed map of a place named &#x27;Blackmoor&#x27;.&quot;

On October 30, 2010, Full Sail University dedicated the student game development studio space as &quot;Dave Arneson&#x27;s Blackmoor Studios&quot; in Arneson&#x27;s honor.

Since the release of the history of Braunstein in 2008 and &quot;Playing at the World&quot; in 2012, a scholarly work by Jon Petersen, the role of Dave Wesely and Dave Arneson was restored in the broad conversation on the origins of the tabletop role-playing games. Robert Kuntz published &quot;Dave Arneson&#x27;s True Genius&quot; in 2017 and gave interviews to Kotaku to detail how the gameplay of the current tabletop role-playing games was designed by Arneson. In 2019, the documentary &quot;The Secrets of Blackmoor&quot; presented interviews of the first players of Dave Arneson and acknowledged his innovations.

<doc id="211856" wikidata="Q5288229" url="?curid=211856" title="Dog Tax War">
<text>The Dog Tax war was a confrontation in 1898 between the Crown and a group of Northern Māori, led by Hone Riiwi Toia, opposed to the enforcement of a &#x27;dog tax&#x27;. It has been described by some authors as the last gasp of the 19th-century wars between the Māori and European settlers. It was in fact a bloodless &quot;war&quot;, with only a few shots being fired. Hōne Heke Ngāpua, MHR for Northern Māori, was responsible for de-escalating the confrontation.

==The tax==
In the 1890s the Hokianga County Council imposed a tax of 2/6d (half crown) on each dog in the district. Many people, particularly in the South Hokianga, refused to pay—including Hone Riiwi Toia. The gradual encroachment on Māori autonomy, including the introduction of colonial laws instigated an armed protest, the response to which became known as the Dog Tax War.

==The role of religion==
Hone Toia was the leader/prophet of a breakaway group of Wesleyans called Te Huihuinga or Te Huihui. Te Huihuinga was also a political movement and considered themselves as having seceded from &#x27;Te Kotahitanga&#x27; – the autonomous Māori parliament movement founded upon the 1835 &quot;Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand&quot; that pre-dated the Treaty of Waitangi. Hone had also met with Te Whiti-o-Rongomai the leader of the Pai Marire movement, Te Huihuinga adopted aspects of this movement which sought to retain their right to live as Māori without interference, and to make use of their traditional resources as guaranteed by the Treaty of Waitangi.

Other grievances held by this group included seasonal restrictions on the hunting of native birds, the land tax (on land held under Crown grant within five miles of a public road), the wheel tax (on vehicles with certain tyre widths).

It was during a Te Huihui meeting that Hone Toia prophesied that &quot;if dogs were to be taxed, men would be next&quot;.

Some Europeans regarded Hone Toia as an imposter, while others associated him with the Hau Hau movement. This was a vehemently anti-Pākehā cult that had developed in the 1860s and spread throughout the North Island, and had been heavily involved in the later major conflicts, such as the Second Taranaki War.

==Enforcement==
In June 1897, Henry Menzies was put in charge of dog registrations by the Hokianga County Council, for which he received only the commission of one shilling for each dog collar sold. In 1898 he served 40 summons at Pukemiro pa (Hone Toia&#x27;s village in Hauturu), where Menzies was rumoured to have said, that if the people refused to pay they would be sent to an ice-bound country where their bones would crack from the cold, (probably referring to the prisons of the lower South Island).

This suitably terrified the people of Te Huihuinga, some choosing to sleep in the bush out of fear of being arrested. Hone Toia intervened successfully achieving an adjournment to the summons, he then set up a meeting at Pukemiro on 28 April, inviting Seon, Constable Alexander McGilp, Menzies and others.

==Resistance begins==
Returning to the Hokianga, on 28 April 1898, Seon, Constable Alexander McGilp, Menzies and others attended the meeting. There they found one hundred and fifty men led by Hone Toia. Romana te Paehangi an elder and relative of Hone stated that they would not pay any taxes and that &#x27;they would die on account of these taxes&#x27;. Hone Toia confirmed that they would rather resist than be driven further into poverty and hardship.

At Pukemiro they also announced their intention to come to Rawene (the administrative centre of the area) with their guns to continue their dispute with the County Council. They also gave assurances that no women or children or settlers would be hurt and that there would be no bloodshed unless they came in contact with the law. A telegraph was composed at the meeting and sent to Clendon in Hone Toia&#x27;s name, however the message received was understood to mean that war would be waged because of the dog tax and that blood would be shed.

In Rawene panic ensued, many people withdrew to neighbouring Kohukohu or aboard the steamer &#x27;Glenburg&#x27;.

A police inspector and five constables arrived by boat from Auckland and set up a cannon on the wharf. The party of less than 20 including Hone Toia and led by Romana Te Paehangi duly appeared, stripped for war, ready to present themselves to the law. The outnumbered police sensibly fled leaving their cannon behind. Rawene was deserted apart from a few neutral Māori and a handful of Pākehā including Rev. Gittos, and contractor Robert Cochrane.
Cochrane described the war party as quiet, expressing friendship to all but the law and as stating that they would not fire first. Gittos and Cochrane eventually persuaded them to return to Waima later that evening.

Descendants of the men involved described how Bob Cochrane ran the local hotel. Despite it being a Sunday and therefore illegal, he agreed to open the bar and served the visiting war party with beer. This gesture of goodwill went a long way to defusing the situation.

Some four days later the government had assembled a force of 120 men armed with rifles, two field guns and two rapid fire guns landed in Rawene. The force under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Newall and was later reinforced by the Royal Navy sloop HMS &quot;Torch&quot;.

On 5 May 1898, the government forces marched on Waima, Hone Toia sent a message requesting Newall wait at Omanaia, Newall refused. An ambush was feared at the crest of the hill between Waima and Rawene, after two shots were fired over the heads of the colonial troops. However the soldiers were allowed to pass unmolested and carried on to set up camp at Waima School. Toia and his men being camped some distance away.

==Surrender and imprisonment of Hone Toia==
The potential was there for serious conflict. However the situation was defused by the timely arrival of the Member of the House of Representative (MHR) for Northern Māori, Hōne Heke Ngāpua. He was the grand-nephew of the famous Hōne Heke. He met with Hone Toia and negotiated a truce and the surrender of Hone, his people and some of their guns. Hone Toia was arrested on 6 May with four others, 11 more were arrested later.

Hōne Heke Ngāpua had previously sent a telegraph to Hone Toia, advising him to disband his people, withdraw peacefully and to petition parliament, this was seen as a wise move by Heke, considering such acts as the 1863 Suppression of Rebellion Act, which suspended habeas corpus and introduced martial law into disturbed districts, and the New Zealand Settlements Act, which provided for the punitive confiscation of &#x27;rebel natives&#x27; land.

Charged with &quot;Intending by conspiring to levy war against the Queen in order to force her to change her measures, and conspiring by force to prevent collection of taxes&quot;, Hone and four others were sentenced for a total of two and a half years of hard labour. Others were subsequently fined and heavy costs imposed, but these were later remitted.

Hone Toia near the end of his sentence in Mount Eden prison, prophesied the date of the Huihuinga prisoners release, as the predicted day wore on his powers appeared to have left him, but later that night at 9pm, it was announced and the prisoners released. Te Huihuinga were released short of their full sentence, on 15 March 1899, this was probably due to the petitions of numerous Iwi (tribes) of the Hokianga and far north.

These events are still remembered to this day; the dog tax in the Hokianga remains, yet is still somewhat neglected, up to this very day.

<text>Banana slugs (Ariolimax) are a genus of air-breathing, terrestrial gastropod slugs in the family Ariolimacidae. Their often yellow color and elongated shape can resemble a banana, thus giving rise to their common name.

==Species==
Species within the genus &quot;Ariolimax&quot; include:
Synonyms:
* &quot;Ariolimax andersonii&quot; : synonym of Prophysaon andersonii (J.G. Cooper, 1872) (unaccepted combination)
* &quot;Ariolimax californicus&quot; : synonym of &quot;Ariolimax californicus&quot; 
* &quot;Ariolimax californicus costaricensis&quot; : synonym of &quot;Deroceras costaricensis&quot; 
* &quot;Ariolimax hemphilli&quot; W: synonym of &quot;Hesperarion hemphilli&quot; (W.G. Binney, 1875)
* &quot;Ariolimax niger&quot; : synonym of &quot;Hesperarion niger&quot; 
* &quot;Ariolimax steindachneri&quot; : synonym of &quot;Ariolimax columbianus&quot; 

==Description==

Banana slugs are often bright yellow (giving rise to the banana nomenclature) although they may also be greenish, brown, tan, or white. The species &quot;Ariolimax columbianus&quot; sometimes has black spots that are so extensive that the animal looks almost entirely black. Individual slugs can change colors with alterations in diet, light exposure, and moisture levels. Color may also be an indicator of the age or health status of an individual.

The Pacific banana slug is the second-largest species of terrestrial slug in the world, achieving a length of up to and a weight of up to . The largest slug species is &quot;Limax cinereoniger&quot;, which can reach in length. Banana slugs have an average lifespan of 1–7 years.

Banana slugs (like other gastropods and many other mollusks) have a radula, a ribbon-like anatomical structure covered in rows of microscopic teeth. The radula is used for feeding. Individuals can move at per minute.

Slugs use two pairs of tentacles to sense their environment. The longer, upper pair are used to detect light or movement. The shorter, lower pair are used to detect chemicals. Both pairs of tentacles are muscular hydrostats which can be fully retracted when necessary to avoid damage. If the animal loses a tentacle, the slug can grow a new one.

Banana slugs have a single pallial lung which opens externally via a pneumostome on the right side of the mantle of the animal. The pneumostome lung cavity is heavily vascularized to allow gas exchange. Dehydration is a major problem for the mollusk; to combat this, banana slugs excrete a thick coating of mucus around their bodies and can also aestivate. To do so, they secrete a protective layer of mucus and insulate themselves with a layer of soil and leaves. They remain inactive in this state until the environment becomes moist again. Due to their susceptibility to desiccation, they are more commonly active at night, but also appear during cool, moist days.

The slime also contains pheromones to attract other slugs for mating. Slugs are simultaneous hermaphrodites, and reproduce by exchanging sperm with their mate. They produce up to 75 translucent eggs, which are laid in a log or on leaves. Slugs mate and lay eggs throughout the year. The adults provide no further care for their eggs beyond finding a suitable hiding spot, and the eggs are abandoned as soon as the clutch is laid.

==Distribution==
&quot;Ariolimax columbianus&quot; is native to the forest floors along North America&#x27;s Pacific coastal coniferous rainforest belt (including douglas-fir forests and redwood forests) which stretches from Southeastern Alaska to Santa Cruz, California.

Several discontinuous populations also occur in forested slopes of the coastal and transverse mountain ranges south of Santa Cruz as far south as Ventura County, with a tiny, isolated population located in Palomar Mountain State Park within the Palomar Mountain Range in San Diego County, California. The Palomar Mountains have lush Sierra Nevada-like coniferous forests and black oak woodlands unlike the surrounding semiarid lands of inland San Diego County and mark the southernmost population of banana slugs.

Small, isolated populations also occur east of the Pacific Coast such as in the inland coniferous rainforests of British Columbia&#x27;s Columbia Mountains (interior wet-belt), just west of the Canadian Rockies, and have been seen at lower elevations near creeks and damp areas of Mount Revelstoke National Park. Small populations of banana slugs have also been seen along creek and damp areas of the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountains to the north of Yosemite National Park in California. Slug densities in these outlying areas in the Columbia Mountains, Sierra Nevada Mountains, and areas south of Santa Cruz are low compared to densities in the coastal coniferous rainforest belt and are rather restricted to damp areas near creeks, ravines, and gullies. This population may also be a relic from the Pleistocene epoch.

==Ecology==

Banana slugs are detritivores, or decomposers. They consume leaves, animal droppings, moss, and dead plant material, and then recycle them into soil humus. They are generalist feeders, though they exhibit a preference for certain mushrooms. Through their consumption of various plant matter and animal excretion, banana slugs acts as agents of seed dispersal. They spread seeds and spores, and excrete a nitrogen-rich fertilizer. Additionally, by consuming dead organic matter, they contribute to decomposition and the nutrient cycles and are an important aspect of the ecosystem.

Small mammals, snakes, and salamanders sometimes eat banana slugs.

==Slime==
The mucus secreted by banana slugs contains chemicals that can numb the tongue of predators. This mucus can absorb up to 100 times its volume in water. Technically, this slime is neither liquid nor solid, but rather a liquid crystal substance. Slug slime bears a resemblance to human mucus, primarily composed of proteins known as mucins. Upon contact with environmental moisture, dry mucin granules swell dramatically, expanding to hundreds of times their original volume. This expansion contributes to the slimy texture but doesn&#x27;t involve the numbing effect seen in banana slugs. Moreover, the slime serves the purpose of maintaining moisture on the skin of these slug-like creatures, akin to fruit, which facilitates gas exchange to support respiration. The glycoprotein-based mucous behaves as a liquid crystal, occupying a unique state between a solid and a liquid. Its molecular dispersion prevents it from being a true liquid, yet it lacks the compactness of a solid, displaying an organized, crystal-like pattern. 

This mucous secretion serves a multitude of purposes in the life of a banana slug. It aids in locomotion, allowing them to glide gracefully across the forest floor. The slime also serves as a protective barrier, acting as a deterrent against potential predators and pathogens. Additionally, banana slug slime plays a role in reproduction, as slugs deposit chemical cues within the slime to attract potential mates. The slime&#x27;s vivid yellow color, which is responsible for their common name, not only adds to their eccentric appearance but also acts as a warning signal to potential predators that it may not be a tasty meal. Banana slug mucus has potential to carry mites and other parasitic organisms.

== Reproduction ==

Banana slugs are hermaphroditic, possessing both male and female reproductive organs. This feature allows them to mate as either sex or even fertilize themselves. The versatile slime also plays a role in their mating rituals. During the mating phase, banana slugs release pheromones through their adhesive trails to attract potential partners. Due to a slug&#x27;s ability for self-fertilization, there is a high degree of homozygosity. Notably, their courtship process can be quite robust and, in certain species, may culminate in apophallation. During the mating ritual between two slugs, they both engage in a dance-like action where they will circle each other, occasionally lunging, nipping, and tail whipping.  University of California, Santa Cruz research associate Janet Leonard notes that apophallation occurs some time after copulation, and the process of chewing takes around 45 minutes, but can take longer.  After mating, the slugs separate and seek a sheltered location to lay their eggs. An impregnated slug will typically lay a range of 3 to 50 eggs in a small crevice. These eggs will typically hatch within a month or two, and the young slugs will mature over several months. Their offspring will typically contain a pale white hue and as they grow acquire their distinct yellow color.

==In culture==
Banana slugs have been used as food by Yurok Natives of the North Coast and by German immigrants in the 19th and early 20th centuries. A yearly festival and contest is held at Russian River including slug races and a contest for recipes though, even when fed corn meal to purge them or soaked in vinegar to remove slime, the slugs&#x27; flavor is not always well regarded for the modern palate, and the most successful entries are often those in which the flavor is unnoticeable.

The banana slug (specifically &quot;Ariolimax dolichophallus&quot;, which is the most common banana slug on campus) is the mascot of the University of California, Santa Cruz. It is common in local forests, was approved by a student vote, and was named the best college mascot by Reader&#x27;s Digest in 2004. The “Every Little Thing” podcast also dedicated half an episode to discussing the banana slug and its historical relevance to the UCSC. After celebrating 25 years of the establishment of the banana slug as UCSC’s mascot, on Sept. 27, 2011, the Santa Cruz City Council declared that day as the official “Day of the UC Santa Cruz Banana Slug.” One T-shirt caption was: &quot;No known predators!&quot;

On September 27, 2024, Governor Gavin Newsom signed AB 1850, making the banana slug the official state slug of California.

<text>Finland is divided into 19 regions (; )
which are governed by regional councils that serve as forums of cooperation for the municipalities of each region. The councils are composed of delegates from the municipal councils. The main tasks of regional councils are regional planning, the development of enterprises, and education. Between 2004 and 2012, the regional council of Kainuu was elected via popular elections as part of an experimental regional administration.

In 2022, new Wellbeing services counties were established as part of a health care and social services reform. The wellbeing services counties follow the regional borders, and are governed by directly elected county councils.

== Åland ==
One region, Åland, has a special status and has a much higher degree of autonomy than the others, with its own Parliament and local laws, due to its unique history and the fact that the overwhelming majority of its people are Finland Swedes. The sole language of Åland is Swedish/Finland Swedish, unlike the rest of the country where Finnish and Swedish share official status. It has its own elected head of government who carries the title of Premier and heads the Lantråd, the regional executive. Most powers that would be exercised by the Government of Finland on the mainland are instead exercised by Åland-specific authorities which execute independent policy in most areas. The Åland islanders elect a single representative to the national legislature, while the Government of Finland appoints a Governor to represent the national government on Åland. Åland is a demilitarized zone and Åland islanders are exempt from conscription.

== Representation of the state ==
In addition to inter-municipal cooperation, which is the responsibility of regional councils, there are 15 Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment (Finnish: &quot;elinkeino-, liikenne- ja ympäristökeskus&quot;, abbreviated &quot;ely-keskus&quot;), which are responsible for the local administration of labour, agriculture, fisheries, forestry and entrepreneurial affairs. They are each responsible for one or more of regions of Finland, and include offices of the Ministries of Employment and the Economy, Transport and Communications and Environment. The Finnish Defence Forces regional offices are responsible for the regional defence preparations and for the administration of conscription within the region.

<doc id="211868" wikidata="Q4825233" url="?curid=211868" title="Australian trade mark law">
<text>Australian trade mark law is based on common-law use-based rights as well as the &quot;Trade Marks Act 1995&quot; (Cth), which is administered by IP Australia, an Australian government agency within the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science.

Use-based rights are less certain than registration, and depend on the mark having developed a reputation in the region in which a business owner seeks to enforce its common-law trade mark. Registration provides advantages such as constructive notice and nationwide rights.

Among other things, the &quot;Trade Marks Act&quot; defines trade marks (including certification marks and collective marks), what constitutes trademark infringement and defences and exceptions thereto, and (together with the &quot;Trade Marks Regulations&quot; 1995 (Cth)) sets out procedures for registration and other proceedings before the Registrar of Trade Marks. The legislation does not codify the law of trade marks in Australia; as a common law jurisdiction, a trade mark owner may also (for example) seek to protect its rights through legal proceedings for passing off or, more commonly, misleading and deceptive conduct contrary to the Competition and Consumer Act 2010.

Section 17 of the &quot;Trade Marks Act&quot; defines a trade mark as &quot;a sign used, or intended to be used, to distinguish goods or services dealt with or provided in the course of trade by a person from goods or services so dealt with or provided by any other person&quot;.

== Registration ==
The procedure to register a trade mark in Australia is much the same as in other British Commonwealth countries. A completed application is filed by an applicant with IP Australia. The application is then checked (&quot;examined&quot;) by an examiner of trade marks for compliance with formalities and substantive requirements (e.g. registrability, and lack of confusing similarity with a conflicting trade mark). Examination in Australia has (from 2019 to 2021) been backlogged. The Australian Trade Marks Office Manual of Practice and Procedure is an official publication produced by IP Australia, which provides detailed information to examiners and applicants on the practices and procedures relating to the filing, examination, and registration of a trade mark in accordance with the provisions of the &quot;Trade Marks Act 1995&quot; (Cth).

If an application is accepted for registration by an examiner, it will be published for opposition purposes for two months, during which time third parties may oppose registration on certain grounds. If there are no oppositions, or any oppositions are overcome, a certificate of registration will issue.

The term of registration in Australia is 10 years, which may be extended for additional periods of 10 years. Failure to use a registered trade mark for a period of three years or more may expose the registration to removal from the register on the grounds of non-use.

== Infringement ==
Infringement is defined by section 120 of the &quot;Trade Marks Act&quot;, and includes a cause of action for infringement of well-known marks.

== Assistance from Customs ==
The Australian Border Force has in place a procedure permitting a registered trade mark owner to seize goods which infringe registered trade mark rights.

<doc id="211869" wikidata="Q9632" url="?curid=211869" title="1956 Winter Olympics">
<text>The 1956 Winter Olympics, officially known as the VII Olympic Winter Games () and commonly known as Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo 1956 ( or ), were a multi-sport event held in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Italy, from 26 January to 5 February 1956.

Cortina, which had originally been awarded the 1944 Winter Olympics, beat out Montreal, Colorado Springs and Lake Placid for the right to host the 1956 Games. The Cortina Games were unique in that many of the venues were within walking distance of each other. The organising committee received financial support from the Italian government for infrastructure improvements, but the rest of the costs for the Games had to be privately financed. Consequently, the organising committee was the first to rely heavily on corporate sponsorship for funding.

Thirty-two nations—the largest number of countries participating in the Winter Olympics until then—competed in the four sports and twenty-four events. Austrian Toni Sailer became the first person to sweep all three alpine skiing events in a single Olympics. The figure skating competition was held outdoors for the last time at these Games. Logistically, the only problem encountered was a lack of snow at the alpine skiing events. To remedy this, the Italian army transported large amounts of snow to ensure the courses were adequately covered.

Politics did not affect the 1956 Winter Games – unlike the Summer Games in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia later in the year which many nations boycotted after the Soviet repression of the Hungarian Revolution, and the Suez War. The Cortina Olympics were the first Winter Olympics televised to a multi-national audience. Cortina is scheduled to co-host the 2026 Winter Olympics with Milan, Lombardy, 70 years after the 1956 Games.

==Host city selection==
Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo is a ski resort village situated in the Dolomite Alps in the north-eastern corner of Italy. In 1956, it had a population of 6,500 people. Count Alberto Bonacossa, an accomplished alpine skier, figure skater and a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) since 1925, spearheaded the effort to bring the Olympic Games to Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo. He persuaded the city council of Cortina to bid for the 1944 Games. During the 38th IOC Congress held in London in 1939, Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo was awarded the 1944 Winter Olympics, but the Games were canceled due to the outbreak of World War II.

In 1946 the Italian Winter Sports Federation convened in Milan and decided to support a new attempt from Cortina to host the Winter Games. A delegation, led by Count Bonacossa, presented Cortina&#x27;s bid to host the 1952 Winter Olympics at the 40th IOC Session in Stockholm, Sweden. They were backed by the city&#x27;s council and the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI, &quot;Comitato Olimpico Nazionale Italiano&quot;). A rival bid from Oslo, Norway, soundly defeated Cortina. Count Bonacossa&#x27;s and CONI prepared a third bid, this time for the 1956 Winter Games. The host city selection took place in Rome, during the 43rd IOC Session. On 28 April 1949, Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo was selected with 75% of the votes, over bids from Montreal, Colorado Springs and Lake Placid. Unfortunately, Bonacossa died on 30 January 1953, three years before he could witness Cortina host the Games.

==Participating nations==
A total of 32 nations sent athletes to Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo. Along with the Soviet Union, Bolivia and Iran competed at the Winter Games for the first time, making Bolivia the first completely tropical nation to participate in a Winter Olympics. Korea, Liechtenstein, and Turkey returned after having missed the 1952 Winter Olympics, while Argentina, Denmark, New Zealand, and Portugal did not compete at these Games, after having participated in the previous edition. Athletes from West Germany (FRG) and East Germany (GDR) competed together as the United Team of Germany, an arrangement that would continue for the following two Olympiads.

Below is the list of participating nations, with the number of competitors indicated in brackets:

==Organization==

The 1956 Winter Olympics was organised by a committee composed of members of the Italian National Olympic Committee and the Italian government. Observers were sent to the Oslo Games in 1952 to collect information regarding the sports programme, infrastructure, and accommodation requirements. The intelligence gathered there indicated that Cortina&#x27;s facilities were not up to Olympic standards. The town did not have an ice stadium, or a speed skating rink; the alpine ski runs, ski jump and bobsleigh run were in poor condition. Cortina was a small village, and its infrastructure would be overwhelmed by the crowds expected for the Games. To accommodate the influx of people, new roads and rail lines had to be built, and the city&#x27;s power grid and telephone lines expanded. Enhancements also had to be made to sewer and water capacity. The Italian government supplied Italian lira 460 million for infrastructure improvements. The Italian Olympic Committee was responsible for funding the rest of the costs of hosting the Games. They did this by setting aside monies from their own budget, ticket sales, and even culling funds from local football betting pools. The organising committee also took the unprecedented step of selling corporate sponsorship. For example, Fiat was designated the official car of the 1956 Winter Olympics, and Olivetti supplied typewriters for the 400 journalists attending the Games.

==Politics==
The Cold War began after the allied victory in World War II. Until 1952, many of the Communist countries of Eastern Europe had participated in Worker&#x27;s Olympics or Spartakiads. The Soviet Union emerged from international isolation by eschewing the Spartakiad and participating in the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki; they made their Winter Olympics debut at the Cortina Games. Soviet general secretary Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s aim was to use international sports competitions, such as the Olympics, to demonstrate the superiority of communism, strengthen political ties with other communist countries, and project the Soviet Union as a peace-loving nation actively engaged in the world. The Soviets&#x27; participation at the Olympics raised the level of competition as they won the most medals and more gold medals than any other nation. Soviet Olympic team was also notorious for skirting the edge of amateur rules. All Soviet athletes held some nominal jobs, but were in fact state-sponsored and trained full-time. According to many experts, that gave the Soviet Union a huge advantage over the United States and other Western countries, whose athletes were students or real amateurs. The Cortina Games were held before the Hungarian Revolution and subsequent Soviet invasion, and the Suez War, which occurred in the autumn of 1956; the Winter Games escaped the boycotts that plagued the Melbourne Olympics, which were celebrated in November and December of that year.

===Television===
The Cortina Games were the first Winter Olympics to be broadcast to a multi-national audience. Television as a mass communication technology was expanding rapidly in the 1950s. In the midst of the Cold War, Europe was a propaganda battlefield as countries relayed television signals across the Iron Curtain. By 1956, countries in the Soviet sphere of influence had achieved a technological advantage and were able to broadcast communist television programmes into Finland, the eastern border regions and more isolated geographic areas of West Germany and Austria, where residents had coverage from an East German broadcast with a pro-communist point-of-view. Most West Germans watched the 1956 Winter Olympics via Eurovision broadcasts which were relayed all over western Europe including all major West German stations (Eurovision connectivity in 1956) The political ramifications were not the only impact television had on these Olympics. The Cortina Games did not generate revenue from television – the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley were the first to do so – but were an experiment in the feasibility of televising a large multi-sport event. For the first time at an Olympic Games, the venues were built with television in mind. For example, the grand stand at the cross-country ski venue (&quot;Lo Stadio della neve&quot;) was built facing south so that the television cameras would not be adversely affected by the rising or setting sun.

==Events==

Medals were awarded in 24 events contested in 4 sports (8 disciplines). The programme for the 1956 Winter Games saw two new events added to the four sports and twenty-two events from the 1952 Olympics, namely the men&#x27;s 30 kilometre cross-country ski race and the women&#x27;s 3x5 kilometre cross-country relay race.

===Opening ceremonies===
The opening ceremonies took place on Thursday, 26 January 1956 in the Olympic Ice Stadium. Temporary seating was added to boost the stadium&#x27;s capacity to 14,000 people. Athletes representing 32 nations marched in the ceremony and Mr Giovanni Gronchi, President of the Italian Republic, declared the Games open. At this point, speed skater Guido Caroli skated into the stadium with the Olympic flame. While he was entered on a circuit of the Ice Stadium he tripped and fell over a television cable; he regained his feet and lit the cauldron. The Olympic oath was delivered by Giuliana Chenal-Minuzzo; this was the first time a female athlete gave the oath at an Olympic Games. Michał Spisak&#x27;s Olympic Hymn, officially recognised as such at the IOC congress in Paris on 13 June 1955 (declined in 1958 in favor of the Olympic Hymn by Spyridon Samaras), was played for the first time at the Cortina Games.

===Bobsleigh===

There were two bobsleigh events, the two-man and four-man competitions. Every participating nation was limited to two sleighs in each event. The sleighs made four runs, with the total time summed. The Italians won gold and silver in the two-man event. Switzerland took third place when they passed Spain on the fourth run. In the four-man event held a week later, the Swiss won the gold medal, Italy picked up the silver, and the United States won the bronze. Italy had participated in all six previous Olympic bobsleigh competitions but had never reached the podium. Italians Renzo Alverà and Eugenio Monti won the silver in the two-man competition and were also on the silver-winning four-man sleigh. Monti&#x27;s silver medals at the 1956 Games were the first of six Olympic medals he would win in his bobsleigh career. The bobsleigh run at Cortina was eventually renamed the Eugenio Monti track to honour his bobsleigh career. The medals won in bobsleigh would be the host nation&#x27;s only medals at these Games. One complaint of the bobsleigh events was that the track surface suffered extensive damage due to overuse. This hampered the performance of teams drawn late in the competition.

===Ice hockey===

The eighth Olympic ice hockey tournament also served as both the European and World Championships. Split into three pools before the tournament, the ten participating nations began by playing each team in their pool in a round robin format. The top two teams from each pool advanced to the final round, with the remaining teams played in a consolation group for 7th through 10th places. Canada, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union took first place in their preliminary pools with undefeated records. Germany, the United States, and Sweden took second place in their pools.

An important early matchup of the final round was the game between Canada and the United States. The Canadians had never lost to the US in Olympic play prior to that game. In what was considered a tremendous upset, the United States defeated Canada 4–1. The Americans, who placed fourth at the 1955 World Ice Hockey Championships and were not expected to medal, then faced the USSR, who won the tournament in 1954 and took silver in 1955 behind Canada, in a game that would eventually make the difference in the gold medal. The Russian team was leading only 1–0 late into the third period but then scored three in quick succession, overwhelming the underdogs and winning the match 4–0. The USSR then played Canada, who still had a chance to win the gold if they defeated the Soviets, and won 2–0 despite being dramatically outshot in the first and second periods. The USSR won gold, the United States surprisingly took silver and Canada, with their two losses, earned bronze, their worst result to date in Olympic play.

===Figure skating===
The Cortina Games were the last Olympics to feature figure skating outdoors. Skaters from the United States won five medals, sweeping the men&#x27;s event and taking the top two spots in the ladies&#x27; event. Tenley Albright was the women&#x27;s Olympic champion despite sustaining a serious injury in practice. Less than two weeks before the Olympics she was practicing her skating routine when she hit a rut in the ice and fell. Her skate cut through several layers of clothing, and sliced her right leg at the ankle. Her teammate Carol Heiss won the silver, and Austrian Ingrid Wendl earned the bronze medal. Americans Hayes Jenkins, Ronald Robertson, and Jenkins&#x27; brother David Jenkins were the men&#x27;s medallists. The Austrian pair of Sissy Schwarz and Kurt Oppelt took the gold medal in the pairs event. Canadians Frances Dafoe and Norris Bowden won the silver and the Hungarian siblings Marianna Nagy and László Nagy defended their bronze medal from the 1952 Games.

===Speed skating===

The Soviet Union dominated the speed skating events by winning seven of the twelve medals, including four golds. Soviet skaters set two world records, an Olympic record, and had at least one medallist in each of the four events. Yevgeny Grishin was the top individual performer, with two gold medals and two world records. Grishin and Soviet teammate Yuri Mikhaylov tied in the 1,500 metre race. It was decided to award both of the athletes gold medals and leave the silver medal position vacant. Sigvard Ericsson of Sweden earned gold and silver medals and set an Olympic record in the 10,000 metre event.

===Alpine skiing===

Six alpine skiing events were held, three for men and three for women. The races were the downhill, slalom and giant slalom. Toni Sailer of Austria swept the men&#x27;s gold medals, becoming the first person to win three alpine skiing golds in a single Olympics. Led by Sailer, the Austrians dominated the alpine skiing events for both men and women, winning nine out of a possible eighteen medals. The Austrians were particularly successful in the giant slalom; the men swept the medals and the women took silver and bronze. Chiharu Igaya won the first Winter Olympics medal for Japan when he placed second in the slalom. Swiss teammates, Madeleine Berthod and Renée Colliard won the women&#x27;s downhill and slalom races. Germany earned its only gold medal of the Games when Ossi Reichert took first in the giant slalom.

===Cross-country skiing===

Two women&#x27;s events were added to the cross-country skiing programme for the first time. The Soviet women took the top two spots in the individual 10 kilometre race but lost to Finland in the new 3x5 kilometre relay. The men had a new event as well, the 30 kilometre race, which was won by Veikko Hakulinen from Finland. The other three men&#x27;s events were won by three different nations: Norway took the 15 kilometre race, Sweden the 50 kilometre event, and the Soviet Union won the relay. Overall the Soviet Union won seven out of a possible eighteen medals in cross-country skiing. Sweden, behind the strong skiing of Sixten Jernberg, won six medals. Jernberg won a gold, two silvers, and a bronze, which were the first of nine Olympic medals he would earn in his cross-country career.

===Nordic combined===
There were significant changes to the Nordic combined event at the 1956 Games. The event had always been a cross-country race followed by a ski jump. Originally the competitors in the Nordic combined were entered into the open 18 kilometre cross-country race, which meant that they competed alongside athletes who were dedicated cross-country skiers. Their times were combined with their score from two ski jumps to determine the winner. At the Cortina Games, the format was altered to allow the Nordic combined athletes to compete in a dedicated 15 kilometre cross-country race. Two days later they had three jumps on the ski jump hill. Their best two scores were combined with their cross-country time to determine a winner. This format would become the standard for Nordic combined competitions going forward. Norway continued its dominance of Nordic combined when Sverre Stenersen won the gold medal. Since its inception at the 1924 Games, the country had only lost the Nordic combined event once. Stenersen was followed by Bengt Eriksson of Sweden and Poland&#x27;s Franciszek Gąsienica Groń.

===Ski jumping===

In the ski jumping event, the Swiss jumper, Andreas Däscher introduced a new style of jumping, which would soon come to be known as the Däscher technique. Before these Games, the athletes would hold their arms forward over their heads. Däscher reasoned that if the athlete held his arms at his side he would fly farther. Adherents to this new style dominated the competition. Finnish jumpers Antti Hyvärinen and Aulis Källakorpi took first and second place; Harry Glass of Germany won the bronze medal. This competition marked the end of Norwegian dominance in the sport. Since the first winter Games in 1924, the Norwegians had won the gold medal at each Olympics until 1956. The poor performance of the Norwegian jumpers was attributed to their refusal to use the new jumping technique.

===Closing ceremonies===
The closing ceremonies took place on Sunday, 5 February in the Olympic Ice Stadium. They were preceded by a figure skating exhibition performed by the men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, and pairs figure skating champions. The flag bearers of each nation then entered the stadium followed by the flags of Greece, Italy, and the United States. These three flags were raised to honor the nation that founded the Olympics, the host nation, and the next country to host the Winter Games. Avery Brundage, President of the International Olympic Committee, declared the Olympics closed, and a fireworks display concluded the Games.

==Calendar==
:&quot;All dates are in Central European Time (UTC+1)&quot;
The opening ceremony was held on 26 January, along with the first games of the hockey tournament. From 27 January until 5 February, the day of the closing ceremony, at least one event final was held each day.

† The numeral indicates the number of event finals for each sport held that day.

==Venues==

A unique feature of the Cortina Olympics was the proximity of many event locations which were in walking distance of each other within the town of Cortina. The speed skating events were held at Lake Misurina, roughly from Cortina. The venues featured grandstands heated by silica coils built into the seats. Silica coil heating was a technology that had only recently become economical. The competitions were held without incident except for the skiing events, which suffered from a lack of snow.

A notable venue not found at the 1956 Games was an Olympic Village, where the athletes would be housed. The town of Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo had a population of less than 7,000 people in 1956. Local hotels were concerned that after the Olympics an Olympic Village would so significantly increase the hotel capacity it would put many of them out of business. Athletes were billeted by local families or stayed in hotels during the Games.

The Olympic Ice Stadium (&quot;Stadio Olimpico Del Ghiaccio&quot;) was intended to be the focal point of the Games. It was built on the banks of the Boite river just north of Cortina. After new roads and a bridge had been constructed, the stadium was an eight-minute walk from the center of town. The stadium was built to accommodate 6,000–7,000 people. Due to space limitations the grandstands were constructed vertically, with tiers built directly on top of each other. There were two artificial ice rinks of , with a total ice surface of . A special cooling plant was built under the stadium, which froze the ice through the evaporation of ammonia. The construction cost totaled ITL 1.3 billion (US$2.1 million in 1956), making it the most expensive venue of these Games. The stadium was used for the opening and closing ceremonies, all of the figure skating competitions and main ice hockey games. After the Games, the organising committee made the Ice Stadium a gift to the city of Cortina and turned it on a permanent installation. It was used as an ice skating rink in the winter and an outdoor gymnasium for judo and gymnastics in the summer and will host the curling events at the 2026 Winter Olympics.

The &quot;Apollonio Stadium&quot; was used for select games of the ice hockey tournament. Considerable work had to be done to bring the stadium up to date. A second rink was added to allow for two games to be held simultaneously. The stadium was outfitted with electric lights and the seating capacity was enlarged to accommodate 2,000 people.

The bobsleigh run (&quot;Pista Olimpica di Bob – Eugenio Monti&quot;), was originally constructed in 1928. The track was rebuilt and expanded several times during the years leading up to the Olympics. A state-of-the-art signal board was installed displaying a diagram of the run with the position of each sleigh on the run shown with lights, this track will host again the bobsleigh along the skeleton and the luge again during the 2026 Winter Olympics.

Situated around from Cortina, near Zuel, the &quot;Italia&quot; Jump (&quot;Trampolino Olimpico Italia&quot;) was originally built in 1923 as the &quot;Franchetti&quot; Jump. After modifications in 1926, the first structure was demolished in 1939 and rebuilt in 1940. With the 1956 Games coming to Cortina, the jump had to be updated again to comply with the technical demands of the Olympics. On 15 April 1955, the &quot;Franchetti&quot; Jump was finally demolished and the new &quot;Italia Jump&quot; was completed in the same year at a cost of nearly ITL 310 million ($500,000). The reinforced concrete platform was high, and possessed a long, 35° steep in-run. Two grandstands, each with a capacity for 3,000 people, were placed on either side of the landing slope; a natural amphitheatre at the bottom of the hill could hold up to 40,000 standing spectators. A special road was built between Cortina and the venue for the transport of athletes, officials and authorities.

The Snow Stadium (&quot;Stadio della neve&quot;) was constructed from Cortina, and hosted all of the cross-country events. Two grandstands were constructed to accommodate 6,000 people. Three types of cross-country courses were constructed: one of , three of , and four of . Some of these courses went through the bobsleigh run. As a result, a bridge had to be constructed so events occurring in the two venues would not interfere with each other.

The alpine runs (&quot;Le piste alpine&quot;) were built on the slopes of Monte Tofana and Monte Faloria in the nearby Dolomite alps. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s downhill and slalom races were held on Tofana. Faloria was the site of the two giant slalom events. It took nearly two years to complete construction of the runs. In previous years, lack of snow was never an issue, but in the winter of 1956 there was insufficient snowfall for skiers to safely navigate the runs. As a consequence, snow had to be transported from other parts of the mountains by the Italian army.

The Misurina rink (&quot;La pista di Misurina&quot;) was the location of the speed skating events. This was the last time that speed skating at the Olympics was held on natural ice. It was from Cortina. The rink was established at the northern end of the lake with a mountain backdrop. Stands were constructed to accommodate 8,500 people. Despite the event being held outdoors on lake ice, two world records and two Olympic records were broken during the competition.

Three of the venues for these games (the bobsleigh run, indoor arena, and ski jump) would serve as film location for the 1981 James Bond film &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;.
