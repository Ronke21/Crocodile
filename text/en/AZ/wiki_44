<text>(formerly written as Hakodadi) is a city and port located in Oshima Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan. It is the capital city of Oshima Subprefecture. As of January 31, 2024, the city had an estimated population of 239,813 with 138,807 households, and a population density of 354 persons per km² (920 persons per mi²). The total area is . The city is the third biggest in Hokkaido after Sapporo and Asahikawa.

== History ==
Hakodate was Japan&#x27;s first city whose port was opened to foreign trade in 1854, as a result of Convention of Kanagawa, and used to be the most important port in northern Japan. Also, the city had been the biggest city in Hokkaido before the Great Fire of Hakodate in 1934.

=== Pre-Meiji restoration ===
Hakodate (like other parts of around Hokkaido) was originally populated by the Ainu. The name &quot;Hakodate&quot; may have originated from an Ainu word, &quot;hak-casi&quot; (&quot;shallow fort&quot;). Another possibility is that it means &quot;box&quot; or &quot;building&quot; in Japanese which refers to the castle built by the Kono (Kano) clan in the fifteenth century.

Hakodate was founded in 1454, when Kono Kaganokami Masamichi constructed a large manor house in the fishing village of Usukeshi, the word for bay in Ainu.

After his death, Masamichi&#x27;s son, Kono Suemichi, and family were driven out of Hakodate into nearby Kameda during the Ainu rebellion in 1512 and little history was recorded for the area during the next 100 years. There was constant low-level conflict in the Oshima peninsula at the time with the Ainu, as armed merchants, like the Kono family, established bases to control trade in the region. This conflict culminated in an uprising from 1669 to 1672, led by Ainu warrior Shakushain after which the Ainu in the region were suppressed.

Hakodate flourished during the Hoei period (1704–11), and many new temples were founded in the area. The town&#x27;s fortunes received a further boost in 1741 when the Matsumae clan, which had been granted nearby areas on the Oshima Peninsula as a march fief, moved its Kameda magistracy to Masamichi&#x27;s house in Hakodate.

In 1779, the Tokugawa shogunate took direct control over Hakodate, which triggered rapid development in the area. Merchant Takadaya Kahei, who is honoured as the founder of Hakodate port, set up trading operations, which included opening the northern Etorofu sea route to the Kuril island fisheries. He is credited with turning Hakodate from a trading outpost into a thriving city. A Hakodate magistracy was established in 1802. By 1807, the power of the Tokugawa government extended to the entire region. However, in 1821, the central government relaxed their control of the area and restored the Matsumae clan to the full powers they had before.

=== Meiji restoration ===
The port of Hakodate was surveyed by a fleet of five U.S. ships in 1854 under the conditions of the Convention of Kanagawa, as negotiated by Commodore Matthew C. Perry.

Hakodate port partially opened to foreign ships for provisioning in the following year and then completely to foreign trade on 2 June 1859 as one of five Japanese open ports designated in the 1858 Treaty of Amity and Commerce signed with the U.S. The Hakodate foreign settlement is one of the legacies of foreign influence in Hakodate.

A mariner in Perry&#x27;s fleet died during a visit to the area and became the first U.S. citizen to be buried in Japan when he was interred in Hakodate&#x27;s cemetery for foreigners.

British merchant, naturalist and spy, Thomas Blakiston, took up residence in Hakodate in the summer of 1861 to establish a saw milling business. He stayed in Hakodate until 1884, during which time he documented the local natural environment, equipped the local meteorological station and ran guns to the Boshin War rebels.

As one of few points of Japanese contact with the outside world, Hakodate was soon host to several overseas consulates. The Russian consulate included a chapel from where Nicholas of Japan is credited with introducing Eastern Orthodox Christianity to Japan in 1861 (now the Japanese Orthodox Church). The Orthodox church is neighbored by several other historical missionary churches, including Anglican and Catholic.

Hakodate also played a central role in the Boshin War between the Tokugawa shogunate and the Meiji Emperor which followed Perry&#x27;s opening of Japan. Shogunate rebel Enomoto Takeaki fled to Hakodate with the remnants of his navy and his handful of French advisers in winter 1868, including Jules Brunet. They formally established the Republic of Ezo on December 25. The republic tried unsuccessfully to gather international recognition to foreign legations in Hakodate, including the Americans, French, and Russians. The Naval Battle of Hakodate was fought from 4 to 10 May 1869, between the remnants of the Tokugawa shogunate navy and the newly formed Imperial Japanese Navy. It was a decisive victory for the Imperial Japanese Navy.

On 14 June 1868, Hakodate was designated as an urban prefecture (府 fu), one of the first two, the other being Kyoto. On February 8, 1882, it was enlarged into Hakodate-ken, and then became part of Hokkaido on January 26, 1886.

The rebels occupied Hakodate&#x27;s famous European-style Goryōkaku fort and used it as the centre of their defences in southern Hokkaido. Government forces defeated the secessionists in the Battle of Hakodate in 1869 and the city and fort were surrendered to emperor. Military leader, Hijikata Toshizō, was one of those slain in the fighting.

In 1878, Isabella Bird reported of the city in her travelogue: 
The streets are very wide and clean, but the houses are mean and low. The city looks as if it had just recovered from a conflagration. The houses are nothing but tinder… Stones, however, are its prominent feature. Looking down upon it from above you see miles of grey boulders, and realise that every roof in the windy capital is &quot;hodden doun&quot; by a weight of paving stones.

=== 20th century to present day ===

Hakodate was awarded city status on August 1, 1922. On March 21, 1934, a serious fire had destroyed around two-thirds of all the buildings in Hakodate. This event also led to many residents leaving and subsequently depopulating the city. The city escaped most of the ravages of World War II. Areas around Hakodate-yama were fortified and access restricted to the public. Many prisoners of war were interned in Hakodate and historians record a total of 10 camps. The city was subjected to two Allied bombing raids on 14 and 15 July 1945. Around 400 homes were destroyed on the western side of Hakodate-yama and an Aomori-Hakodate ferry was attacked with 400 passengers killed.

In 1976, a defecting Soviet pilot named Viktor Belenko flew his plane into the civilian airport in Hakodate.

Hakodate&#x27;s size nearly doubled on December 1, 2004, when the town of Minamikayabe (from Kayabe District), and the towns of Esan and Toi, and the village of Todohokke (all from Kameda District), were merged into it.

The Hokkaido Shinkansen line opened on 26 March 2016. The undersea Seikan Tunnel with the Shinkansen rail line greatly reduced the travel time from Honshu to Hakodate.

In April 2023, Jun Ōizumi became the mayor of Hakodate. Ōizumi, the older brother of actor Yo Oizumi, defeated 3-term incumbent Toshiki Kudō, receiving more than 80% of the vote.

== Geography ==

Mount Hakodate was originally an island that was formed by volcanic eruptions millions of years ago. During the course of history a sand bar formed between Mount Hakodate and the peninsula. This landform, which is an example of a tombolo, finished forming in circa 1000 BCE. The tombolo connects the former Hakodate island with the main island Hokkaido to the north. The main central area of Hakodate city is located on the sandbar.

Hakodate is located at the center of Kameda Peninsula. The city is overlooked by Mount Hakodate. The summit can be reached by hiking trail, cable car, or by car. Visitors can also reach the peak of Mount Hakodate by taking tour bus and/or direct bus. that departs from JR Hakodate Station. An obscure local nickname of the bumpy mountain is &quot;Gagyūzan&quot; (Mount Cow&#x27;s Back), alluding to the way the mountain resembles a resting cow.

The former Goryōkaku fort is now used in as a public park and is popular in Hokkaido for &quot;hanami&quot; (cherry blossom viewing). Since April 2006, the park has also featured the tall, white Goryōkaku Tower. Resembling an air traffic control tower, the structure offers a panoramic view of the park, including mainland Japan across the Tsugaru Strait on clear days.

<text>The Battle of Sekigahara (Shinjitai: ; Kyūjitai: , Hepburn romanization: &quot;Sekigahara no Tatakai&quot;), was an important battle in Japan which occurred on October 21, 1600 (Keichō 5, 15th day of the 9th month) in what is now Gifu Prefecture, Japan, at the end of the Sengoku period.

This battle was fought by the forces of Tokugawa Ieyasu against a coalition loyal to the Toyotomi clan, led by Ishida Mitsunari on behalf of the young child Toyotomi Hideyori, from which several commanders defected before or during the battle, leading to a Tokugawa victory. The Battle of Sekigahara was the largest battle of Japanese feudal history and is often regarded as the most important.

Mitsunari&#x27;s defeat in the battle of Sekigahara is generally considered to be the beginning point of the Tokugawa shogunate, which ruled Japan for another two and a half centuries until 1868.

==Background==
The final years of Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s reign were turbulent. At the time of Hideyoshi&#x27;s death, his heir, Toyotomi Hideyori, was only 5 years old, causing a power vacuum in Japan.

===Feuding factions===

In the years following the Imjin War and the death of Hideyoshi, factional disputes arose between Ishida Mitsunari and seven former Toyotomi generals including Katō Kiyomasa. Tokugawa Ieyasu gathered both Kiyomasa and Fukushima Masanori to his cause in a bid to challenge the opposition from Mitsunari, who claimed to fight on behalf of the Toyotomi clan. At this time, political tensions were high in the capital; rumors circulated of assassination attempts towards Ieyasu, while a son of Maeda Toshiie, Toshinaga, was accused of being involved in such conspiracies and forced to submit to Ieyasu. Uesugi Kagekatsu, one of Hideyoshi&#x27;s regents, stood against Ieyasu by building up his army, which Ieyasu officially questioned, demanding answers from Kyoto about Kagekatsu&#x27;s suspicious activity. Naoe Kanetsugu responded with a mocking letter highlighting Ieyasu&#x27;s own violations of Hideyoshi&#x27;s orders.

Mitsunari met with Ōtani Yoshitsugu, Mashita Nagamori and Ankokuji Ekei, conspiring to raise an anti-Tokugawa army, of which Mōri Terumoto was appointed to be the overall commander. This coalition formed what came to be referred to as the Western Army. Terumoto immediately marched and captured Osaka Castle while the main army of the Tokugawa were still on their way to suppress Kagekatsu.

At first, Mitsunari wanted to use Gifu Castle, which at that time was commanded by Oda Hidenobu (the grandson of Oda Nobunaga), and Ōgaki Castle as choke points to impede the advances of the Eastern Army (the Tokugawa-led coalition). However, this plan was foiled by a number of campaign events:
* Gifu Castle was captured by the Eastern Army under Fukushima Masanori and Ii Naomasa before the main forces of the Western Army arrived. 
* On October 19, Shimazu Yoshihiro&#x27;s troops were beaten by Mizuno Katsunari in a battle outside Sone Castle, after which Katsunari razed the outer moat of Ōgaki Castle and forced Yoshihiro to retreat into Ise Province.
* Mitsunari realized that the Tokugawa army was heading towards Osaka Castle.

Following these failures and the threat against Osaka Castle, Mitsunari changed his plan and prepared his army for an open battle on the field of Sekigahara against the main body of the Eastern Army, led by Ieyasu. As preparation for this inevitable conflict, Ieyasu had purchased massive quantities of Tanegashima matchlocks.

However, one day before the beginning of the battle, Kikkawa Hiroie, vassal of the Western Army-allied Mōri clan, colluded with the Eastern Army and promised that the Mōri clan would change sides during the battle, on the condition they would be pardoned after the war. Kuroda Yoshitaka and Kuroda Nagamasa served as representatives of the Eastern Army in this correspondence with Hiroie. Hiroie and his senior retainer Fukubara Hirotoshi presented hostages to the Tokugawa side as proof for their cooperation with the latter.

==The battle==
At dawn on October 21, 1600, the Tokugawa advance guard stumbled into Ishida&#x27;s army; neither side saw each other because of dense fog caused by earlier rains. Both sides panicked and withdrew, but each was now aware of their adversary&#x27;s presence and location. Mitsunari placed his position in defensive formation, while Ieyasu deployed his forces south of the Western Army position. Last-minute orders were issued and the battle began. Traditional opinion has stated the battle began around 8:00 am; however, recent Japanese historians&#x27; research estimates that the battle actually began closer to 10:00 am.

The battle started when Ii Naomasa, previously heavily involved in the Battle of Gifu Castle, commanded his famed unit of 3,600 crimson-clad &quot;Ii no Akazoane&quot; (&quot;Ii&#x27;s red devils&quot;) to attack the center of the Western Army. According to historian Watanabe Daimon, by many indications of the battle records, the assignment of Naomasa as &quot;ichiban-yari&quot; (the first unit to engage the enemy) suggests the armies may have already been settled before the battle. Fukushima Masanori concurred with Naomasa&#x27;s intention to lead the first attack, as Naomasa was appointed by Ieyasu as the supreme field commander and was therefore responsible for all commands and strategies during the battle.

Naomasa charged forward with 30 spearmen and clashed with the ranks of the Western Army. Meanwhile, Fukushima Masanori advanced from his position, following Naomasa and immediately engaging with troops led by Ukita Hideie.

At this point, the battle entered a deadlock. Ōta Gyūichi, who was present at the battle, wrote in his chronicle that &quot;friends and foes are pushing each other&quot; and &quot;gunfire thunders while hails of arrows fly in the sky&quot;. According to records from Spanish accounts, 19 cannons from the &quot;&quot;, a Dutch trading ship, were also used by the Tokugawa army in this battle.

===Western Army defectors===
During the battle of Sekigahara, several commanders of the Western Army changed sides, allying with the Tokugawa and changing the course of the battle. Perhaps the most notable of these defectors was Kobayakawa Hideaki, the nephew of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, whose disgruntlement with his uncle was exploited by the Tokugawa to sway his loyalty. Two prevailing theories exist regarding the timeline of Hideaki&#x27;s defection:

* The conventional theory regarding Hideaki&#x27;s defection suggests that the defection occurred partway through the battle. Although he had agreed to defect to the Tokugawa side beforehand, Hideaki was allegedly hesitant during the battle and remained neutral, reportedly only joining the battle around noon as a member of the Eastern Army. Some later historical accounts claim that as the battle grew more intense, Ieyasu finally ordered his arquebuses to fire at Kobayakawa&#x27;s position on Mt. Matsuo to force a choice. This version allegedly originated from an anecdote about Hideaki dating to the Edo period.
* Modern Japanese researchers of Sekigahara, such as Jun Shiramine and Junji Mitsunari, have advanced the theory that Hideaki had already defected to the side of Tokugawa by the start of the battle, based on correspondence documents between Hideaki and Kuroda Nagamasa before the battle, as well as Ōtani Yoshitsugu&#x27;s army position at the start of the battle suggesting foreknowledge by the Western Army of Hideaki&#x27;s betrayal. Historian Stephen Turnbull also argues that the sheer distance between the Eastern Army positions and that of Kobayakawa, far out of range of arquebuses and likely too far for a shot to even be heard, makes the &quot;story about Ieyasu ordering ‘cannon-shot’ into his ranks&quot; to force Hideaki&#x27;s hand very unlikely. Furthermore, Yūichi Goza explains that the story of Ieyasu shooting at Hideaki&#x27;s location comes from secondary sources from the Edo period, suggesting it may have been the result of dramatization and embellishment from pro-Tokugawa shogunate historiography to aggrandize Ieyasu&#x27;s success in Sekigahara.

Regardless of what actually transpired, the turncoat Kobayakawa forces overwhelmed Yoshitsugu&#x27;s position. At the same time, Yoshitsugu&#x27;s troops also engaged the units led by Tōdō Takatora, and Oda Yūraku.

Following the defection of Hideaki, Western Army leaders Wakisaka Yasuharu, Ogawa Suketada, Akaza Naoyasu and Kutsuki Mototsuna also changed sides, further turning the battle in the Eastern Army&#x27;s favor. These four commanders are recorded to have established contact and concluded deals with Tōdō Takatora, one of the main commanders of the Eastern Army, several days before the battle.

Mōri Terumoto, then daimyō of the Mōri clan, also defected from the Western Army during the battle by keeping his forces entrenched at Osaka Castle rather than joining the battle, then sending his vassal Kikkawa Hiroie to quietly surrender to Ieyasu afterward. Professor Yoshiji Yamasaki of Toho University states that any neutrality-for-territorial-preservation agreement was ineffective at best and badly backfired for the Mōri at worst, as their domains were greatly reduced by the Tokugawa following the battle, and some Mōri troops notably did fight with the Western Army at Sekigahara rather than maintaining their neutrality. Sentiments of defection were divided among the Mōri; Mōri Hidemoto, cousin of and commander under Terumoto, genuinely attempted to meet and aid the Western Army, though his efforts were sabotaged by Hiroie, who, under the pretense of being busy eating his meal, stationed his troops in front of Hidemoto, obstructing them from advancing and relieving Mitsunari. Hiroie also obstructed another Western Army contingent led by daimyō Chōsokabe Morichika from marching and attacking the Tokugawa forces.

===Collapse of the Western Army===
One of the first and most notable weak points within the Western Army forces developed on Ukita Hideie&#x27;s front. During the engagement, Hideie&#x27;s forces began to wane and were steadily overcome by the forces of Fukushima Masanori due to the latter&#x27;s superior troop quality. The disparity in combat effectiveness may have been attributable to the prior insurrection within the Ukita clan, which caused many senior samurai vassals of the Ukita to desert and join the Tokugawa faction. Hideie was thereby forced to enter Sekigahara with fresh recruits of rōnin mercenaries to fill the gap left within his army. This proved fatal over the course of long-term combat against the Fukushima clan&#x27;s more disciplined and trained regular troops; the Ukita clan ranks began to break and finally collapse under pressure despite outnumbering the Fukushima.

To the south, Ōtani Yoshitsugu was outnumbered in a successful attack led by Kobayakawa Hideaki; Yoshitsugu committed suicide and his troops retreated shortly thereafter. The Ōtani retreat left the Western Army&#x27;s right flank wide open, which Masanori and Hideaki then exploited to roll the flank of the Western Army. Mitsunari, realizing the situation was desperate, also began retreating his troops. Meanwhile, Western Army commander Shima Sakon was engaged by the troops of Kuroda Nagamasa, who had taken a detour on the north to flank the Mitsunari and Sakon positions. In the end, Sakon was shot and fatally wounded by a round from an arquebus.

Following the capitulation of Sakon&#x27;s unit, Shimazu Yoshihiro found his troops completely surrounded by Masanori and Honda Tadakatsu from the front, while Hideaki troops attacked his rear. The Shimazu troops only managed to break their encirclement after devastating casualties, escaping with only 200 soldiers remaining; even then, they were pursued by Ii Naomasa until the latter was incapacitated by a shot from a rifleman.

The Western Army forces continued to crumble without the arrival of reinforcements, further complicated by the waves of defections, until the battle had finally concluded. Historian Andō Yūichirō estimated that the battle in Sekigahara took place in its entirety over a mere 2 hours – from 10 am to noon – contrary to the Edo-period accepted theory of the battle lasting twice as long.

===Late arrivals===
The combined Eastern Army forces of Tokugawa Hidetada and Sakakibara Yasumasa, who commanded as many as 38,000 soldiers, were at the time of the battle bogged down in the Siege of Ueda against Sanada Masayuki. At the same time, 15,000 Western Army soldiers were being held up by 500 troops under Hosokawa Yūsai in the Siege of Tanabe in Maizuru, many of the former refusing to advance out of their respect for the Hosokawa. Due to these incidents, large proportions of both armies&#x27; forces ultimately never participated in the clash at Sekigahara.

Another Western Army contingent that failed to reach the Sekigahara battlefield was led by Tachibana Muneshige, who had been stalled by Kyōgoku Takatsugu in the Siege of Ōtsu. As result, Muneshige was forced to remain at Osaka Castle after learning of the Western Army&#x27;s annihilation at Sekigahara. However, when Mōri Terumoto (also at Osaka Castle) offered his surrender to the Eastern Army, Muneshige departed with his army and returned to his homeland in Kyushu.

==Aftermath==
As soon as the news of the Eastern Army&#x27;s victory at Sekigahara reached Ogaki Castle, which at the time was still besieged by Mizuno Katsunari, Western Army-affiliated garrison commander Akizuki Tanenaga immediately surrendered and opened the castle for Katsunari. In response, Katsunari immediately wrote to Ii Naomasa asking that Ieyasu pardon Tanenaga, which Ieyasu accepted.

The most prominent political effect of the Eastern Army victory in Sekigahara was the shifting authority to assign military ranks and redistribute lands from the Toyotomi clan to Tokugawa Ieyasu. Immediately following the battle, Ieyasu redistributed domains worth 6.8 million koku, primarily as recompense for the allies instrumental in his victory:

* Ikeda Terumasa was reassigned from Mikawa Province, Yoshida region to a 520,000-koku domain in Harima Province, Himeji region
* Tōdō Takatora was reassigned to a 200,000-koku domain in Imabari, Ehime
* Matsudaira Tadayoshi was reassigned from a 100,000-koku domain in Musashi Province, Yuki region, to a 520,000-koku domain in Echizen Province, Fukui region
* Yūki Hideyasu was reassigned from a 101,000-koku domain in Shimōsa Province, Shinobu region, to a 569,000-koku domain in Owari Province, Kiyosu region
* Gamō Hideyuki was reassigned from a 180,000-koku domain in Shimotsuke Province, Utsunomiya region, to a 600,000-koku domain in Mutsu Province, Aizu region
* Maeda Toshinaga had his 835,000-koku domain in Kaga Province, Kanazawa region, expanded to 1,100,000 koku
* Katō Kiyomasa had his 195,000-koku domain in Higo Province, Kumamoto region, expanded to 515,000 koku
* Kuroda Nagamasa was reassigned from a 180,000-koku domain in Buzen Province, Nakatsu region, to a 523,000-koku domain in Chikuzen Province, Fukuoka region
* Fukushima Masanori had his 200,000-koku domain in the area of contemporary Aki District, Hiroshima, expanded to 498,000 koku
* Horio Tadauji had his domains in Matsue, Izumo, expanded to 240,000 koku
* Ieyasu also bestowed increases of at least into 10,000 koku to many of his fudai daimyō (Tokugawa clan hereditary vassals) whose domain were less than 10,000 koku before the battle.

Notably, Kobayakawa Hideaki, whose defection from the Western Army contributed greatly to Ieyasu&#x27;s victory, was bestowed a domain which covered parts of Bizen Province and Mimasaka Province and which was worth 520,000 koku. Perhaps surprisingly, Ieyasu bestowed only meager domain increases to the three remaining Shitennō (Ii Naomasa, Honda Tadakatsu, and Sakakibara Yasumasa), his closest high-ranking generals, as compared to those he offered to newer commanders and vassals. However, it is possible this perceived disparity was the result of those generals choosing to decline Ieyasu&#x27;s offers of extensive compensation.

As for the generals of the defeated Western Army, roughly 87 daimyō had their domains confiscated and their power stripped due to their support of Mitsunari in the battle. The long-standing Chōsokabe clan, headed by Chōsokabe Morichika, was stripped of its title and domain of Tosa Province, which was consequently given to Yamauchi Kazutoyo in recognition of his service to the Tokugawa. Several former Chōsokabe retainers resisted the forcible takeover by the Tokugawa and Yamauchi; in response, Ii Naomasa sent military reinforcements to assist Kazutoyo in suppressing the rebellion of Chōsokabe vassals in Tosa. Suzuki Hyōe, vassal of Naomasa, relieved Kazutoyo with an army transported by 8 ships, ultimately pacifying the region in 5 weeks after killing about 273 enemies.

On September 17, Ieyasu dispatched his army, led by Kobayakawa Hideaki, to attack Sawayama Castle in Ōmi Province, the home base of Mitsunari. Most of the castle&#x27;s troops had been sent to Sekigahara, leaving the castle&#x27;s garrison with only 2,800 men. Despite Mitsunari&#x27;s absence, the defense of the castle was initially successful under the leadership of Mitsunari&#x27;s father Ishida Masatsugu and brother Masazumi. Following the defection of retainer Moritomo Hasegawa and other defenders, the castle was opened to the besieging army; most of Mitsunari&#x27;s relatives, including Masatsugu, Masazumi, and Mitsunari&#x27;s wife Kagetsuin, were killed in battle or committed suicide.

In response to Shimazu Yoshihiro&#x27;s support of the Western Army, Ieyasu prepared a massive punitive expedition to Kyushu, to be led by his son Tokugawa Hidetada. This force was to be composed of Eastern Army forces thereupon engaged in the West, including the armies of Katō Kiyomasa, Kuroda Yoshitaka, Nabeshima Naoshige, and the Tachibana clan. However, this operation was aborted once Shimazu Yoshihisa, the head of the Shimazu clan, entered negotiations with Ieyasu. Shimazu-Tokugawa deliberations continued until 1602 and were aided by the intercession of Kiyomasa, Yoshitaka, and Tachibana Muneshige; ultimately, the Shimazu clan avoided punishment, becoming the only Western Army-aligned clan to avoid losing territory after the defeat at Sekigahara.

On November 6, Ishida Mitsunari, Konishi Yukinaga and Ankokuji Ekei were captured and executed.

In 1603, Ieyasu was officially appointed as &quot;shōgun&quot; by Emperor Go-Yōzei; as such, the conclusion of the Battle of Sekigahara has served as the &quot;de facto&quot; beginning of the Edo period, and more generally, of the return of stability to Japan. In 1664, Hayashi Gahō, Tokugawa historian and rector of Yushima Seidō, wrote: 

In 1931, the location of the battle was registered as a Monument of Japan. The positions of Ieyasu and Mitsunari&#x27;s armies, and that of the death of Ōtani Yoshitsugu, are commemorated therein.

<text>During the Second World War, Jock columns were small combined arms groups of armoured cars, artillery and motorised infantry, generally drawn from the British 7th Armoured Division. They were used in the Western Desert Campaign by the British Army to harass German and Italian forces. The columns were named after an officer who was a superb exponent of the tactic and may have conceived it originally, Lieutenant Colonel John Charles &quot;Jock&quot; Campbell.

The basis for the Jock column was a battery of six 25-pounder and a troop of 2-pounders, supported by a squadron of tanks and a company of infantry, along with several anti-aircraft artillery guns. Having suffered heavily in the Battle of Greece and in Crete, the mobility of the Jock column allowed the British to compensate for their equipment losses by deploying artillery where needed. On the defensive, Jock columns could effectively harass the enemy, or attack their rear areas, but the columns&#x27; decentralized nature made them ill-suited for stopping a major attack.

However, once the British went on the offensive in mid-1941 with their Brevity and Battleaxe operations, &quot;British doctrine had become weakened by the improvised over-use of Jock Columns&quot;. Rather than concentrating armor as Rommel tended to, the columns were further separating their tanks into groups which were more easily defeated. The splitting up of critical medium and heavy artillery made them less effective at covering assault troops, and &quot;Royal Artillery commanders were critical of the lack of concentration of guns&quot;.

<doc id="204559" wikidata="Q26226431" url="?curid=204559" title="Wader">
<text>Waders or shorebirds are birds of the order Charadriiformes commonly found along shorelines and mudflats in order to forage for food crawling or burrowing in the mud and sand, usually small arthropods such as aquatic insects or crustaceans. The term &quot;wader&quot; is used in Europe, while &quot;shorebird&quot; is used in North America, where &quot;wader&quot; may be used instead to refer to long-legged wading birds such as storks and herons.

There are about 210 species of wader, most of which live in wetland or coastal environments. Many species of Arctic and temperate regions are strongly migratory, but tropical birds are often resident, or move only in response to rainfall patterns. Some of the Arctic species, such as the little stint, are amongst the longest distance migrants, spending the non-breeding season in the southern hemisphere.

Many of the smaller species found in coastal habitats, particularly but not exclusively the calidrids, are often named as &quot;sandpipers&quot;, but this term does not have a strict meaning, since the upland sandpiper is a grassland species.

The smallest member of this group is the least sandpiper, small adults of which can weigh as little as and measure just over . The largest species is believed to be the Far Eastern curlew, at about and , although the beach thick-knee is the heaviest at about .

==Taxonomy==
In the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, waders and many other groups are subsumed into a greatly enlarged order Ciconiiformes. However, the classification of the Charadriiformes is one of the weakest points of the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, as DNA–DNA hybridization has turned out to be incapable of properly resolving the interrelationships of the group. Formerly, the waders were united in a single suborder &quot;Charadrii&quot;, but this has turned out to be a &quot;wastebasket taxon&quot;, uniting no fewer than four charadriiform lineages in a paraphyletic assemblage. However, it indicated that the plains wanderer actually belonged into one of them. Following recent studies (Ericson et al., 2003; Paton et al., 2003; Thomas et al., 2004a, b; van Tuinen et al., 2004; Paton &amp; Baker, 2006), the waders may be more accurately subdivided as follows, with &quot;Charadrii&quot; being repurposed into a monophyletic suborder of plovers, oystercatchers, and their close relatives.

The waders are traditionally a group of two charadriiform suborders which include 13 families. Species in the third charadriiform suborder, Lari, are not universally considered as waders, though the families in Lari which may variously be included are listed below as well.

* Suborder Charadrii (or Eucharadrii)
** Family Burhinidae – stone-curlews, thick-knees (10 species)
** Family Pluvianellidae – Magellanic plover
** Family Chionidae – sheathbills (2 species) 
** Family Pluvianidae – Egyptian plover 
** Family Charadriidae – plovers (68 species) 
** Family Recurvirostridae – stilts, avocets (10 species) 
** Family Ibidorhynchidae – ibisbill 
** Family Haematopodidae – oystercatchers (12 species) 
* Suborder Scolopaci
** Family Rostratulidae – painted-snipes (3 species) 
** Family Jacanidae – jacanas (8 species) 
** Family Pedionomidae – plains-wanderer 
** Family Thinocoridae – seedsnipes (4 species) 
** Family Scolopacidae – sandpipers, snipes (98 species)
* Suborder Lari
** Family Turnicidae – buttonquails (18 species)
** Family Dromadidae – crab-plover
** Family Glareolidae – coursers, pratincoles (17 species)

== Characteristics ==
Shorebirds is a blanket term used to refer to multiple bird species that live in wet, coastal environments. Because most these species spend much of their time near bodies of water, many have long legs suitable for wading (hence the name &#x27;Waders&#x27;). Some species prefer locations with rocks or mud. Many shorebirds display migratory patterns and often migrate before breeding season. These behaviors explain the long wing lengths observed in species, and can also account for the efficient metabolisms that give the birds energy during long migrations.

The majority of species eat small invertebrates picked out of mud or exposed soil. Different lengths of bills enable different species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food. Many waders have sensitive nerve endings at the end of their bills which enable them to detect prey items hidden in mud or soft soil. Some larger species, particularly those adapted to drier habitats will take larger prey including insects and small reptiles.

=== Sexual dimorphism ===
Shorebirds, like many other animals, exhibit phenotypic differences between males and females, also known as sexual dimorphism. In shorebirds, various sexual dimorphisms are seen, including, but not limited to, size (e.g. body size, bill size), color, and agility. In polygynous species, where one male individual mates with multiple female partners over his lifetime, dimorphisms tend to be more diverse. In monogamous species, where male individuals mate with a single female partner, males typically do not have distinctive dimorphic characteristics such as colored feathers, but they still tend to be larger in size compared to females. The suborder Charadrii displays the widest range of sexual dimorphisms seen in the order Charadriiformes. However, cases of sexual monomorphism, where there are no distinguishing physical features besides external genitalia, are also seen in this order.

=== Sexual selection ===
One of the biggest factors that leads to the development of sexual dimorphism in shorebirds is sexual selection. Males with ideal characteristics favored by females are more likely to reproduce and pass on their genetic information to their offspring better than the males who lack such characteristics. Mentioned earlier, male shorebirds are typically larger in size compared to their female counterparts. Competition between males tends to lead to sexual selection toward larger males and as a result, an increase in dimorphism. Bigger males tend to have greater access (and appeal) to female mates because their larger size aids them in defeating other competitors. Likewise, if the species exhibits gender role reversal (where males take on roles traditionally done by females such as childcare and feeding), then males will select female mates based on traits that are the most appealing. In the Jacana species, females compete with each other for access to male mates, so females are larger in size. Males choose female mates based on who presents herself as the strongest and who &#x27;owns&#x27; the most territory.

=== Natural selection ===
Another factor that leads to the development of dimorphisms in species is natural selection. Natural selection focuses on traits and the environment&#x27;s response to the traits in question; if the said trait increases the overall fitness of the individual possessing it, then it will be &#x27;selected&#x27; and eventually become a permanent part of the population&#x27;s gene pool. For example, depending on the food available in a shorebird specie&#x27;s respective niche, bigger bill sizes may be favored in all individuals. This would essentially lead to monomorphism within the species but is subject to change once sexual selection acts on the trait. Sexual selection could give rise to males with relatively larger bills than females if males used their bills to compete with other males. If larger bill size assisted the male in gathering resources, it would also make him more attractive to female mates.

<text>The Sugarhill Gang is an American hip hop group formed in Englewood, New Jersey in 1979. Their hit &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot;, released the same year they were formed, was the first rap single to become a top 40 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, reaching a peak position of number 36 on January 12, 1980. This was the trio&#x27;s only U.S. hit, though they would have further success in Europe until the mid-1980s. The trio reformed in 1994 and embarked on a world tour in 2016.

== History ==

=== Formation and early years ===
The members, all from Englewood, New Jersey, consisted of Henry &quot;Big Bank Hank&quot; Jackson, Michael &quot;Wonder Mike&quot; Wright and Guy &quot;Master Gee&quot; O&#x27;Brien. The three were assembled into a group by producer Sylvia Robinson, who founded Sugar Hill Records with her husband, record producer Joe Robinson. The group and the record company were named after the Sugar Hill, Harlem neighborhood.

Their 1979 hit &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; was the first rap single to become a top 40 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; is now considered one of the most important rap songs of all time. The group never had another top 40 U.S. hit, though it had multiple European hits, such as &quot;Apache&quot;, &quot;8th Wonder&quot; (which was performed on the American music show &quot;Soul Train&quot; in 1981), &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Reprise (Jam Jam)&quot;, and &quot;Showdown&quot; (with the Furious Five). The trio wound down over the next five years and disbanded in 1985.

=== Later years ===

In 1990, the group briefly reunited to perform during the &quot;RapMania: The Roots of Rap&quot; concert at the Apollo Theater in New York City.

Joey Robinson, Sylvia Robinson&#x27;s son, reformed the Sugarhill Gang in 1994. The group recorded &quot;Jump On It!,&quot; a hip hop children&#x27;s album, in 1999. O&#x27;Brien had not rejoined the group, and at some point, Robinson started performing under O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s stage name &quot;Master Gee&quot;. This frustrated O&#x27;Brien and Wright, the latter of whom — as Robinson&#x27;s bandmate — had tried to convince Robinson not to use the name. Later, Robinson trademarked both the names &quot;Master Gee&quot; and &quot;Wonder Mike&quot;. O&#x27;Brien and Wright went to court to retrieve the rights to their names.

After Wright and Henry &quot;Hen Dogg&quot; Williams (a producer) left Sugar Hill Records in 2005, they reunited with O&#x27;Brien and started performing as &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight Featuring Wonder Mike and Master Gee&quot;. This was due to Joey Robinson&#x27;s performing with Jackson under the name &quot;Sugarhill Gang&quot; simultaneously, and Sugar Hill Records claiming copyright to that name.

Having reacquired the rights to the name &quot;Sugarhill Gang&quot;, the group released &quot;Lala Song&quot; with French record producer and DJ Bob Sinclar in 2009.

On November 11, 2014, Jackson died at the age of 58 after a long battle with cancer.

In 2016, Wright, O&#x27;Brien and Williams embarked on their first world tour in over a decade under the name the Sugarhill Gang. During this time they performed as the Sugarhill Gang for the Art of Rap festival tour and at V Festival in Hylands Park and Weston Park in the UK. Other places included the Clockenflap Festival in Hong Kong on November 27, 2016, and they headlined at the Depot in the Park Festival in Cardiff, United Kingdom on August 5, 2017. In July 2019, they played the North Nibley Festival in England.

In 2019, the Sugarhill Gang celebrated the 40th anniversary of the release of &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; and the group&#x27;s formation. They went on a worldwide tour called Rapper&#x27;s Delight 40th Anniversary World Tour. The gang made new music in early 2019. The tour lasted from May 24 to July 26, 2019.

On October 25, 2019, the group performed &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;.

As of 2024, the group consists of Wonder Mike, Master Gee, Hen Dogg, DJ T-Dynasty and Ethiopian King.

==Discography==
The discography of the Sugarhill Gang includes five studio albums, nine compilations and fifteen singles.

In 1890, Alfred Thayer Mahan&#x27;s book &quot;The Influence of Sea Power upon History&quot; was published and significantly influenced future naval policy—as an indirect result of its influence on Secretary Benjamin F. Tracy, the Navy Act of June 30, 1890 authorized the construction of &quot;three sea-going, coast-line battle ships&quot; which became the . The Navy Act of July 19, 1892 authorized construction of a fourth &quot;sea-going, coast-line battle ship&quot;, which became . Despite much later claims that these were to be purely defensive and were authorized as &quot;coastal defense ships&quot;, they were almost immediately used for offensive operations in the Spanish–American War. By the start of the 20th century, the United States Navy had in service or under construction the three and two battleships, making the United States the world&#x27;s fifth strongest power at sea from a nation that had been 12th in 1870.

Except for , named by an act of Congress, all U.S. Navy battleships have been named for states, and each of the 48 contiguous states has had at least one battleship named for it except Montana; two battleships were authorized to be named Montana but both were cancelled before construction started. Alaska and Hawaii did not become states until 1959, after the end of battleship building, but the battlecruiser, or &quot;Large Cruiser,&quot; was built during World War II and her sister, , was begun but never completed. The pre-dreadnoughts (formerly the Austrian ), (formerly the Austrian ), and the dreadnought USS &quot;Ostfriesland&quot; (formerly the German SMS &quot;Ostfriesland&quot;), taken as prizes of war after World War I, were commissioned in the US Navy, but were not assigned hull classification symbols.

No American battleship has ever been lost at sea, though four were sunk during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Of these, only and were permanently destroyed as a result of enemy action. Several other battleships have been sunk as targets, and , demilitarized and converted into a target and training ship, was permanently destroyed at Pearl Harbor. The hulk of &quot;Oklahoma&quot; was salvaged and was lost at sea while being towed to the mainland for scrapping. Two American-built pre-dreadnought battleships, and her sister , were sunk in 1941 by German bombers during their World War II invasion of Greece. The ships had been sold to Greece in 1914, becoming and respectively.

== 1880s–1910s ==
 and were part of the &quot;New Navy&quot; program of the 1880s. &quot;Texas&quot; and BB-1 to BB-4 were authorized as &quot;coast defense battleships&quot;, but &quot;Maine&quot; was ordered as an armored cruiser and was only re-rated as a &quot;second class battleship&quot; when she turned out too slow to be a cruiser. The next group, BB-5 &quot;Kearsarge&quot; through BB-25 &quot;New Hampshire&quot;, followed general global pre-dreadnought design characteristics and entered service between 1900 and 1909. The definitive American pre-dreadnought was the penultimate class of the type, the &quot;Connecticut&quot; class, sporting the usual four-gun array of weapons, a very heavy intermediate and secondary battery, and a moderate tertiary battery. They were good sea boats and heavily armed and armored for their type. The final American pre-dreadnought class, the &quot;Mississippi&quot;-class, were an experiment in increasing numbers with slower ships of limited range. The Navy soon rejected the concept and within 6 years of commissioning, sold these to Greece in 1914 to pay for a new super-dreadnought .

The dreadnoughts, BB-26 &quot;South Carolina&quot; through BB-35 &quot;Texas&quot;, commissioned between 1910 and 1914, uniformly possessed twin turrets, introduced the superimposed turret arrangement that would later become standard on all battleships, and had relatively heavy armor and moderate speed (). Five of the ten ships used the established vertical triple expansion (VTE) propulsion rather than faster direct-drive turbines, used by the British which had higher fuel consumption. The ships had 8 (&quot;South Carolina&quot; class), 10 (&quot;Delaware&quot; and &quot;Florida&quot;) or 12 (&quot;Wyoming&quot; class) 12-inch guns, or 10 (&quot;New York&quot; class) guns. The dreadnoughts gave good service, the last two classes surviving through World War II before being scrapped. However, they had some faults that were never worked out, and the midships turrets in the ten and twelve-gun ships were located near boilers and high-pressure steam lines, a factor that made refrigeration very difficult and problematic in hot climates. One of their number, &quot;Texas&quot; (BB-35), is the last remaining American battleship of the pre–World War II era and the only remaining dreadnought in the world.

Next came the twelve Standards, beginning with BB-36 &quot;Nevada&quot;, commissioned over the period 1914 to 1920. The last ship commissioned was BB-48 &quot;West Virginia&quot; (BB-49 through 54 were also Standards, but were never commissioned, and scrapped under the Washington Naval Treaty). &quot;Oklahoma&quot; (BB-37) was the last American battleship commissioned with triple expansion machinery; all the other Standards used either geared steam turbines (&quot;Nevada&quot;, the &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; class, &quot;Idaho&quot; and &quot;Mississippi&quot;) or turbo-electric propulsion (&quot;New Mexico&quot;, the &quot;Tennessee&quot; and &quot;Colorado&quot; classes). The Standards were a group of ships with four turrets, oil fuel, a top speed, a tactical diameter at top speed, and heavy armor distributed on the &quot;All or Nothing&quot; principle. Armament was fairly consistent, starting with ten 14-inch guns in the &quot;Nevada&quot; class, twelve in the &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;, &quot;New Mexico&quot; and &quot;Tennessee&quot; classes, and eight guns in the &quot;Colorado&quot; class.

== 1930s–1940s ==
After the 1930s &quot;builders holiday,&quot; the USN commissioned ten more battleships of an entirely new style, the so-called fast battleship. These ships began with BB-55 &quot;North Carolina&quot; and the last ship laid down was BB-66 &quot;Kentucky&quot; (the last completed ship was BB-64 &quot;Wisconsin&quot;). These ships were a nearly clean break from previous American design practices. All ten ships were built to a Panamax design (technically post-Panamax, as they exceeded normal Panamax beam by two feet, but they were still able to transit the canal). They were fast battleships, and could travel with the aircraft carriers at cruising speed (their speed was not intended for that role, but rather so they could run down and destroy enemy battlecruisers). They possessed almost completely homogeneous main armament (nine 16-inch guns in each ship, the sole difference being an increase in length from 45 to 50 calibers with the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class vessels), very high speed relative to other American designs ( in the &quot;North Carolina&quot; and &quot;South Dakota&quot; classes, in the &quot;Iowa&quot; class), and moderate armor. The &quot;North Carolina&quot; class was of particular concern, as their protection was rated as only &quot;adequate&quot; against the 16-inch super-heavy shells. They had been designed with, and armored against, a battery of three quadruple 14-inch guns, then changed to triple 16-inch guns after the escalator clause in the Second London Naval Treaty had been triggered. Secondary armament in these ships was almost homogeneous as well: Except for &quot;South Dakota&quot;, configured as a flagship, the other nine ships of this group sported a uniform 20-gun 5-inch (127 mm) secondary battery (South Dakota deleted two 5-inch mounts to make room for flag facilities). Visually, the World War II ships are distinguished by their three-turret arrangement and the massive columnar mast that dominates the superstructure. The last ship, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; (BB-64), commissioned in 1944 (&quot;Wisconsin&quot; was approved last; however, &quot;Missouri&quot; (BB-63) was commissioned three months later, due to delays from additional aircraft carrier construction). &quot;Missouri&quot; (BB-63), famous for being the ship on which the Japanese instrument of surrender was signed, was the last battleship in the world to be decommissioned on 31 March 1992. Seven of these ten ships are still in existence. &quot;South Dakota,&quot; &quot;Washington&quot; and &quot;Indiana&quot; were scrapped, but the remainder are now museum ships. There was intended to be another class of five of these ships, the &quot;Montana&quot; class (BB-67 &quot;Montana&quot; through BB-71 &quot;Louisiana&quot;), but they were cancelled before being laid down in favor of a greater number of aircraft carriers. The &quot;Montana&quot;-class ships would have been built to a 60,000-ton post-Panamax design, and carried a greater number of guns (twelve 16-inch guns) and heavier armor than the other ships; otherwise they would have been homogeneous with the rest of the World War II battleships.

In October 2006, the last battleships, ( and ), were stricken from the Naval Registry.

=== USS &quot;Texas&quot; (1892) ===
The acquisition of modern, European-built warships by Argentina, Brazil, and Chile had alarmed the United States. The straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back was Brazil&#x27;s commissioning of the battleship &quot;Riachuelo&quot;, which suddenly made the Brazilian Navy the strongest in the Americas. Congressman Hilary A. Herbert, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, said of the situation, &quot;if all this old navy of ours were drawn up in battle array in mid-ocean and confronted by the &quot;Riachuelo&quot; it is doubtful whether a single vessel bearing the American flag would get into port.&quot; Facing the possibility of enemy ironclads operating in American coastal waters, the Naval Consulting Board began planning a pair of ironclads of their own, which would be able to use all major American naval bases and have a minimum speed of . The first of these two was USS &quot;Texas&quot;, long, sporting an armor belt thick, displacing , sailing at a top speed of , and armed with two 35-caliber primary and six 30-caliber secondary guns.

&quot;Texas&quot; was authorized by Congress on 3 August 1886, but construction lagged until she was laid down on 1 June 1889. She was launched in the presence of the granddaughter of Sam Houston on 28 June 1892, and commissioned on 15 August 1895. &quot;Texas&quot;″s early service revealed a number of structural issues, which was addressed via some reinforcement of various parts of the ship, and she ran aground near Newport, Rhode Island, in September 1896. This in turn revealed even more faults with &quot;Texas&quot;, as massive flooding easily disabled her in the shallow waters where she ran aground. After repairs, she joined the North Atlantic Squadron, briefly leaving for a Gulf Coast visit to Galveston and New Orleans that saw her beached on a mud bank off Galveston, an event whose aftermath gave &quot;Texas&quot; her nickname, &quot;Old Hoodoo.&quot; After repairs, she returned to the North Atlantic Squadron and her patrols of the Eastern Seaboard. In the Spring of 1898, &quot;Texas&quot;″s near-sister ship (the other of the two original coastal defense ships) was destroyed by an explosion in Havana&#x27;s harbor, and the United States went to war with the Spanish Empire. An American fleet including &quot;Texas&quot; was at Key West, and was part of the Flying Squadron in its engagements with Spanish fortifications on the Cuban coast. She saw real surface fleet combat on 3 July at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba alongside , , and against the fleet of Pascual Cervera y Topete as it tried to escape the American fleet and emerged with only light damage. After the war, &quot;Texas&quot; was decommissioned and refitted on two occasions before finally be declared obsolete in 1911 and permanently decommissioned and converted into a target ship in the same year. On 15 February 1911, &quot;Texas&quot; was christened as &quot;San Marcos&quot; to free the name up for the dreadnought , and was then sunk in the waters of Tangier Sound by &#x27;s guns. The remains of the &quot;San Marcos&quot; continued to be used for gunnery practice after her sinking until January 1959, when vast quantities of explosives were used to bury her remains.

==Fast battleships==

The term &quot;fast battleship&quot; was applied to new designs in the early 1910s incorporating propulsion technology that allowed for higher speeds without sacrificing armour protection.

<text>Samuel Morey (October 23, 1762 – April 17, 1843) was an American inventor, who worked on early internal combustion engines and was a pioneer in steamships who accumulated a total of 20 patents.

==Early life==

The son of a Revolutionary War Officer, he was the second of seven children born to Israel Morey (1735–1809) and Martha Palmer (1733–1810) and was born in Hebron, Connecticut, but moved to Orford, New Hampshire, with his family in 1768. His father Israel Morey served in the colonial militia and rapidly rose from private to general. Samuel Morey operated a successful lumber business in Orford and Fairlee, Vermont. He died in 1843, and was buried in Orford. Lake Morey in Vermont is named in his honor.

==Steam work==

Morey&#x27;s first patent, in 1793, was for a steam-powered spit, but he had grander plans. Morey realized that steam could be a power source in the 1780s, and he probably appreciated a steamboat&#x27;s potential from work on his father&#x27;s ferry and the locks he designed along the Connecticut river. In the early 1790s he fitted a paddle wheel and steam engine to a small boat and powered it up and down the Connecticut River. Legend has it, this was done on a Sunday morning, when the town was at church, to avoid ridicule if he failed.
The most important aspect of this craft was the paddle wheel. It was an old idea – supposedly dating to antiquities – and previously tried with a steam engine. Jonathan Hulls of England used a rear-mounted paddle wheel in 1737 but an inefficient method of turning the steam engine&#x27;s reciprocating motion into the circular motion hobbled it. In 1789, Nathan Reed of Massachusetts experimented with a paddle wheel, and considered patenting it, but eventually patented a different method instead. The American John Fitch experimented with side-mounted paddle wheels, but in 1791 used and patented oars instead. Morey&#x27;s may have been the first successful use of a steam power paddle wheel, which was the best method of propulsion until the propeller, invented by Fitch, was perfected.

A Road Marker in Vermont is inscribed with his accomplishment, &quot;Samuel Morey, resident of Orford (New Hampshire) and later Fairlee (Vermont), successfully operated a steamboat on the Conn. River in 1793. Making over 4000 experiments, this early scientist patented an internal combustion engine in 1826 to anticipate the age of the motor car and airplane.&quot;

Morey&#x27;s first boat was little more than a proof of concept, so he built another in New York. In a letter to New York legislator William Duer, Morey describes how over the next three summers he traveled down to New York, and the following summer to Hartford, Connecticut to improve and exhibit his boat. Finally, in 1797 he went to Bordentown, New Jersey (a stop on Fitch&#x27;s failed Philadelphia-to-Trenton passenger service), because it was “sickly in New York”, and built a boat employing two side-mounted paddle wheels. At this point, Morey considered his boat ready for commercial use and sought financial backers. For reasons that are unclear, his backing fell through because of “a series of misfortunes”. This is likely the end of Morey&#x27;s direct work with steamboats – although there are many tales of a later fourth steamboat– but not the end of his steam engine patents. In addition to one received in 1795 for improvements he made working on the steam engine in boat, he received patents for other applications and improvements in 1799, 1800, and 1803.

Despite Morey&#x27;s success in building a working steamboat, credit for the first successful steamboat line goes to Robert Fulton and his financier, Chancellor Robert Livingston. This was a cause for contention, as Morey claims that they took some of his ideas. His account, which seems more reasonable than later, derived accounts, is laid out in his letter to Duer and is as follows. The summer after the one Morey spent at Hartford, he returned to New York and gave Livingston a ride in his boat (perhaps at the advice of Benjamin Silliman – publisher of Morey&#x27;s papers – who knew Livingston to be a supporter of the arts). He was impressed and offered Morey a “considerable sum” if he could improve the boat&#x27;s speed to 8 miles per hour. He also offered $7,000 for the rights to use his current work around New York but Morey declined the offer. However, he continued working towards Livingston&#x27;s speed goal. Morey had conversations with Fulton and Livingston, and Livingston even traveled to Orford to see him (although Morey doesn&#x27;t say when or what was discussed). Later, Morey reportedly was aboard Fulton&#x27;s boat and expressed to Fulton his displeasure that his ideas had netted Fulton much but nothing for himself.

In 1815, Morey patented a “revolving” steam engine, described at length in the &quot;American Journal of Science&quot; in 1819 by John Sullivan, its purchaser. With the exception of one harsh initial review predicting that it would barely work – which was rebuffed by Sullivan, it was apparently well received and Sullivan&#x27;s description appeared in the &quot;Edinburgh Philosophical Journal&quot; along with an introduction praising American steam engine and boat refinements. Instead of a stationary cylinder driving a rod that turns a wheel through a second linkage, it seems that the cylinder is allowed to pivot as the rod moves, which then turns a crank. The cylinder&#x27;s pivot doubles as a valve that controls the direction and flow of steam according to its position. The claimed advantages of this configuration are lightweight, high-speed operation, durable construction, and low cost. This engine met with some commercial success; recorded applications include tugboats, a glass factory, and a sawmill in the Boston naval yard. One tugboat even sailed to South Carolina, where its owner was pleased by its performance. Morey received one more steam patent in 1817 but his interest had been captured by experiments with flammable vapors, which had started some time before.

==Experiments with vapors and combustion==
In an 1834 letter to Silliman, Morey wrote: “It is now more than twenty years since I have been in the constant, I may say daily practice of making experiments on the decomposition of water, by mixing with its vapor that of spirits of turpentine, and a great portion of atmospheric air.” This would seem to understate the scope of some research that led to such diverse discoveries as the liquid fueled internal combustion engine, a method for carbonating water, and odd bubbles formed by molten resin. The last two appeared in journals in England and Germany, respectively. Morey noted differences in flames near knots, perhaps rich in sap, or in wet wood. Eventually he experimented with anything he could find: “tar, rosin, rough turpentine, or the spirit, or alcohol, or any kind of oil, fat, or tallow; mineral coal, pitch-pine wood, and the knots, birch bark, pumpkin, sun-flower, flax, and other seeds; as well as many other substances.”

His experiments are described at length over several articles in the &quot;American Journal of Science and Arts&quot;. They are light on theory, and Silliman comments that “[Morey&#x27;s] results are often very valuable, and perhaps, in some cases, not the less so, for having been sought without the direction of preconceived, theoretical views.” This is mostly true; theory enters into these articles mostly for possible explanations. However, in 1834, 15 years after his first publication on the subject, he proposes a theory of combustion that has electricity as its basic force. Hints of this theory may be visible in his first paper, but his early experiments were not guided by it.

His first practical application was to heat water for his revolving engine. He observed that passing steam over burning coal or tar caused the flames to burn brighter and without smoke, and he theorized that the steam was decomposed in this process. Word of these experiments reached the eminent French chemist Gay-Lussac, and he commented on them in &quot;Annales de Chimie et de Physique&quot; in 1819. He contended that the temperature was insufficient to cause decomposition. Instead, the steam freed more flammable vapors in the fuel causing the flame&#x27;s change. Morey was correct. He produced what is now known as town gas. The oxygen from the water combines with carbon from the fuel to form carbon monoxide and the hydrogen forms a diatomic molecule. Both later burn to form water and carbon dioxide. Morey was not the first to use water-gas for lighting, and his devices, including the patented 1818 American Water Burner, simply used the gas immediately instead of piping it to be burnt elsewhere, done as early as 1792 in England. Morey apparently did not know of this advance or at least did not recognize it as the same process. Strangely, in 1819 J. F. Dana of Dartmouth and Harvard proposed attaching steam boilers to street lamps to take advantage of Morey&#x27;s discovery, but water-gas was already being piped to some London street lamps from a central source in 1812. Still, Morey&#x27;s device did produce more light, and there is evidence that it resulted in more efficient combustion.

==Internal combustion work==
During his experiments, Morey discovered that the vapor of turpentine, when mixed with air, was explosive. He recognized its potential, developed an engine, and wrote an unpublished description in 1824, which he modified in 1825 and 1826. He finally published and patented the idea later in that year. The revisions between the drafts are small, and deal mostly with reworking of the engine&#x27;s valves.

The engine has much in common with modern ones. It has two cylinders, a carburetor, a familiar arrangement of valves and cams. However, unlike modern engines, and unlike the earlier 1807 François Isaac de Rivaz engine, the explosion did not directly provide power. Instead, the explosion expelled air from the cylinder through a one-way valve. The cylinder was cooled by a water jacket and water injected into the combustion chamber after it fired. The cooling gasses caused a vacuum and atmospheric pressure drove the piston. Morey did mention trying direct action, and elaborated on it in other descriptions. However, his method was more complicated and possibly less efficient because it used more of the engine&#x27;s stroke to draw in fuel.

Morey demonstrated his engine in New York and Philadelphia and there are eyewitness reports for both. In Philadelphia, he demonstrated it powering a boat and a wagon. Unfortunately, when he decided to demonstrate the car on the street, he fell off after starting the engine and the vehicle powered across Market Street into a ditch. This was the second car ride in the world, and the first in the United States. Despite these mostly successful demonstrations, Morey could not find a buyer, and became frustrated. A letter from Reverend Dana of Orford written in October 1829 tells of Morey&#x27;s trip to Baltimore, “I am told, the Capt. is determined to make one more vigorous effort, to sell his patent right for some of his modern inventions [he later singles out the vapor engine], and if he does not now succeed, he will give the matter up, and return to Orford, to spend his days in quiet.” Morey did not find a buyer, and as he was then in his late 60s, it made sense to stop traveling up and down the east coast and call it quits.

While the engine was state of the art, it was not novel in many respects. Morey seemed aware of contemporary internal combustion work – Hardenberg, who wrote a book on Morey&#x27;s engine, adeptly noted that in his 1825 draft Morey “stated that he named his invention ‘vapor engine, to distinguish it from the… gas engine.’” However, Hardenberg concludes that Morey could only have known of three engines similar to his. He never mentioned them, and Hardenberg concludes that they did not influence Morey. His internal combustion engine is the first documented in the United States, and his use of liquid fuel and a heated surface carburetor was world&#x27;s first. Another interesting feature was the wire mesh used to prevent the combustion from reaching the carburetor. This feature was reinvented and patented again in 1872 because the patent office had lost Morey’s patent in the 1836 patent office fire. The lack of interest in his vapor engine is unfortunate, because the vapor engine was his most farsighted invention. Morey notes in his unpublished 1824 draft that:

He mentions &quot;the earth&#x27;s surface&quot; because elsewhere he proposed using the engine to propel balloons. Now that the internal combustion engine&#x27;s potential has been realized, people often focus on his engine. The first push to popularize his work was done by Charles Duryea, a fellow inventor who produced the first gasoline-powered automobile in America in 1893.. He funded the creation of two working replicas of Morey&#x27;s Engine — one is in the possession of the Smithsonian and the other is owned by Dean Kamen — and posited that Morey&#x27;s engine was a direct precursor of the modern engine, a position with which others disagree. Recently, Morey&#x27;s work has received renewed attention by people other than locals and engineers, in particular American comedian Jay Leno, who is an avid car collector.

==Patent &quot;discovery&quot;==
In 2004, 10 of Morey&#x27;s patents, including the one for the internal combustion engine, were rediscovered in the Dartmouth College archives.

Morey holds the earliest patent for an internal-combustion engine. Other patents include a steam-powered rotisserie.

<text>Karen Corr (born 10 November 1969) is a Northern Irish professional pool and former snooker and English billiards player. She began entering women&#x27;s snooker tournaments at age 15 and went on to win the World Women&#x27;s Snooker Championship three times and the World Women&#x27;s Billiards Championship twice. In 1998, she moved to the United States to play pool professionally. She has won numerous tournaments and has been ranked number one on the WPBA Tour. She was inducted into the BCA Hall of Fame in 2012.

==Early life==
Corr was born on 10 November 1969 in Ballymoney, Northern Ireland and spent her early childhood near Maghera. When she was 8 years old, her family moved to England. She loved watching snooker matches on television and joined a snooker club at the age of 14 with her father and her brother. Her friends in Bourne saw that she had exceptional snooker skills and encouraged her to play in tournaments.

==Snooker and pool career==
At the age of 15, she entered her first tournament in Leicester. She continued to play in tournaments and rapidly became a top player on the women&#x27;s tour. On the day after her 21st birthday, Corr won her first Women&#x27;s World Snooker Championship. She would go on to repeat that feat in 1995 and 1997. She also won the World Women&#x27;s Billiards Championship in 1998 and 1999.

A recession in the mid-1990s and increased restrictions on tobacco sponsorship caused prize funds to rapidly decrease for snooker events outside the World Championship. This forced Corr to look elsewhere for profitable tournament play. Fellow snooker player Julie Kelly told her about the WPBA Tour in America. Corr moved to the U.S. in 1998 to see how well she could play pool. After winning ten consecutive qualifying events, she was able to compete in the professional WPBA events.

By the end of 1998, Corr was ranked #24. At the end of 1999, she was ranked # 4. By the end of 2000, she was ranked 2nd in the world.

Corr won her first WPBA Classic Tour title, &quot;The 2000 Cuetec Cues Players Championship&quot; in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. She completed that year with two more Classic tour titles. She also won the &quot;All Japan Championship&quot; held in Osaka, Japan. She placed second in the &quot;WPA Women&#x27;s World Championship&quot; and in the &quot;UCC World Ladies Championship&quot; held in Tokyo, Japan.

In 2001, she became the first person to win every WPBA Classic tour event in the same season since they began. She won the silver medal at the World Games and placed 2nd at the World Championships. Before 2001 ended, Corr found herself at the top, the No. 1 ranked player in the World and remained there for 2 years.

Since then, she has been a leading player in women&#x27;s pool. The crowning achievement of her career came on 26 October 2012, when Corr was formally inducted into the Greatest Player wing of the BCA Hall of Fame. Her Hall of Fame induction announcement stated &quot;her quick rise to the top and her consistent dominance on American soil has earned her the only spot in this year&#x27;s BCA Hall of Fame class.&quot;

She has been runner-up at the World 9-ball Championship four times.

<doc id="204577" wikidata="Q142792" url="?curid=204577" title="Quercus bicolor">
<text>Quercus bicolor, the swamp white oak, is a North American species of medium-sized trees in the beech family. It is a common element of America&#x27;s north central and northeastern mixed forests. It can survive in a variety of habitats. It forms hybrids with bur oak where they occur together in the wild.

== Description ==
&quot;Quercus bicolor&quot; grows rapidly and can reach tall with the tallest known reaching and lives up to 285 years. The bark resembles that of the white oak. The leaves are broad ovoid, long and broad, always more or less glaucous on the underside, and are shallowly lobed with five to seven lobes on each side, intermediate between the chestnut oak and the white oak. In autumn, they turn brown, yellow-brown, or sometimes reddish, but generally, the color is not as reliable or as brilliant as the white oak can be. The fruit is a peduncled acorn, , rarely , long and broad, maturing about six months after pollination. Good crops of swamp white oak occur every 3 to 5 years, with light crops during intervening years. The minimum seed-bearing age is 20 years, optimum age is 75 to 200 years, and maximum age is usually 300 years. Because the seed of swamp white oak is not dormant, it germinates soon after falling. Seed collections should be made soon after ripening in order to delay early germination. These acorns are difficult to store without germination or loss of viability occurring. Sound acorns have a germinative capacity between 78 and 98 percent. Gravity, rodents, and water are the primary dispersing agents (4,10).

Swamp white oak may live up to 300 years.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Swamp white oak, a lowland tree, occurs across the eastern and central United States and eastern and central Canada, from Maine to South Carolina, west as far as Ontario, Minnesota, and Tennessee with a few isolated populations in Nebraska and Alabama. This species is most common and reaches its largest size in western New York and northern Ohio.

The swamp white oak generally occurs singly in four different forest types: black ash–American elm–red maple, silver maple–American elm, bur oak, and pin oak–sweetgum. Occasionally the swamp white oak is abundant in small areas. It is found within a very wide range of mean annual temperatures from . Extremes in temperature vary from . Average annual precipitation is from . The frost-free period ranges from 210 days in the southern part of the growing area to 120 days in the northern part. The swamp white oak typically grows on hydromorphic soils. It is not found where flooding is permanent, although it is usually found in broad stream valleys, low-lying fields, and the margins of lakes, ponds, or sloughs. It occupies roughly the same ecological niche as pin oak, which seldom lives longer than 100 years, but is not nearly as abundant.

== Uses ==
It is one of the more important white oaks for lumber production. The wood is similar to that of &quot;Q. alba&quot; and is not differentiated from it in the lumber trade. In recent years, the swamp white oak has become a popular landscaping tree due to its relative ease of transplanting. This is the species that was chosen to be planted around the 911 Memorial Site in Manhattan.

Being in the white oak group, wildlife such as deer, bears, turkeys, ducks, and geese as well as other animals are attracted to this tree when acorns are dropping in the fall.

== Cultivars ==
A mix of &quot;Quercus robur fastigiata x Quercus bicolor&quot;, named &#x27;Nadler&#x27; or the Kindred Spirit hybrid oak, exists.

<doc id="204581" wikidata="Q799867" url="?curid=204581" title="Bagaudae">
<text>Bagaudae (also spelled bacaudae) were groups of peasant insurgents in the western parts of the later Roman Empire, who arose during the Crisis of the Third Century and persisted until the very end of the Western Empire, particularly in the less-Romanised areas of Gallia and Hispania. They were affected by the depredations of the late Roman state, wealthy landowners, and clerics.

The invasions, military anarchy, and disorders of the third century provided a chaotic and ongoing degradation of the regional power structure within a declining Empire. During the chaos, the &quot;bagaudae&quot; achieved some temporary and scattered successes under the leadership of members of the underclass as well as former members of local ruling elites.

== Etymology ==
The name probably means &quot;fighters&quot; in Gaulish. C. E. V. Nixon assesses the &quot;bagaudae&quot;, from the official Imperial viewpoint, as &quot;bands of brigands who roamed the countryside looting and pillaging&quot;. J. C. S. Léon interprets the most completely assembled documentation and identifies the &quot;bagaudae&quot; as impoverished local free peasants, reinforced by brigands, runaway slaves and deserters from the legions, who were trying to resist the ruthless labor exploitation of the late Roman proto-feudal colonus manorial and military systems, and all manner of punitive laws and levies in the marginal areas of the Empire.

==Suppression==
After the &quot;bagaudae&quot; came to the full attention of the central authorities around 284 AD, the re-establishment of the settled social order was swift and severe: the peasant insurgents were crushed in 286 AD by the co-Caesar Maximian and his subordinate Carausius under the aegis of the Augustus Diocletian. Their leaders are mentioned as Amandus and Aelianus, although E.M. Wightman, in her &quot;Gallia Belgica&quot; proposes that the two belonged to the local Gallo-Roman landowning class who then became &quot;tyrants&quot; and most likely rebelled against the grinding taxation and garnishing of their lands, harvests, and manpower by the predatory agents of the late Roman state (see &quot;frumentarii&quot;, &quot;publicani&quot;).

The &quot;Panegyric of Maximian&quot;, dating to 289 AD and attributed to Claudius Mamertinus, relates that during the &quot;bagaudae&quot; uprisings of 284–285 AD in the districts around Lugdunum (Lyon), &quot;simple farmers sought military garb; the plowman imitated the infantryman, the shepherd the cavalryman, the rustic harvester of his own crops the barbarian enemy&quot;. In fact they shared several similar characteristics with the Germanic Heruli people. Mamertinus also called them &quot;two-shaped monsters&quot; (&quot;monstrorum biformium&quot;), emphasising that while they were technically Imperial farmers and citizens, they were also marauding rogues who had become foes to the Empire.

==Recurrences==
The phenomenon recurred in the mid-fourth century in the reign of Constantius, in conjunction with an invasion of the Alemanni. Although Imperial control was re-established by the Frankish general Silvanus, his subsequent betrayal by court rivals forced him into rebellion and his work was undone. In around 360 AD the historian Aurelius Victor is the sole writer to note the attacks of &quot;bagaudae&quot; in the peripheries of the larger towns and walled cities.
In the fifth century &quot;Bagaudae&quot; are noted initially in the Loire valley and Brittany, circa 409–417 AD, fighting various armies sent against them by the last seriously effective Western Roman general, Flavius Aëtius. Aetius used federates such as the Alans under their king Goar to try and suppress a Bacaudic revolt in Armorica. St Germanus got mercy for the Bagaudae but they later revolted again under a leader called Tibatto. They are also mentioned around the same time in the province of Macedonia, the only time they emerge in the Eastern Empire, which may be connected with economic hardships under Arcadius.

By the middle of the fifth century they started to appear in Hispania too, and are mentioned in control of parts of central Gaul and the Ebro valley. In Hispania, the king of the Suevi, Rechiar (died 456 AD), took up as allies the local &quot;bagaudae&quot; in ravaging the remaining Roman &quot;municipia&quot;, a unique alliance between Germanic ruler and rebel peasant.

That the depredations of the ruling classes were mostly responsible for the uprising of the &quot;bagaudae&quot; was not lost on the fifth-century writer of historicised polemic Salvian; setting himself in the treatise &quot;De gubernatione Dei&quot; the task of proving God&#x27;s constant guidance, he declares in book iii that the misery of the Roman world is all due to the neglect of God&#x27;s commandments and the terrible sins of every class of society. It is not merely that slaves and servants are thieves and runaways, wine-bibbers and gluttons – the rich are much worse (iv. 3); it is their harshness and greed that drive the poor to join the &quot;bagaudae&quot; and flee for shelter to the barbarian invaders (v. 5 and 6).

==Reputation==
The reputation of the &quot;bagaudae&quot; has varied with the uses made of them in historicised narratives of the Late Roman Empire and the Middle Ages. There has been some speculation that theirs was a Christian revolt, but the sparsity of information in the texts gives that little substance although there may well have been many Christians among them. In general, they seem to have been equal parts of brigands and insurgents.

In the second half of the 19th century, interest in the &quot;bagaudae&quot; revived, resonating with contemporary social unrest. The French historian Jean Trithemié was famous for a nationalist view of the &quot;Bagaudae&quot; by arguing that they were an expression of national identity among the Gallic peasants, who sought to overthrow oppressive Roman rule and realize the eternal &quot;French&quot; values of liberty, equality and brotherhood.

E. A. Thompson in &quot;Past and Present&quot; (1952) portrayed this rural discontent within the context of Marxist class warfare.

<text>The Battle of Five Forks was fought on April 1, 1865, southwest of Petersburg, Virginia, around the road junction of Five Forks, Dinwiddie County, at the end of the Siege of Petersburg, near the conclusion of the American Civil War.

The Union Army commanded by Major General Philip Sheridan defeated a Confederate force from the Army of Northern Virginia commanded by Major General George Pickett. The Union force inflicted over 1,000 casualties on the Confederates and took up to 4,000 prisoners while seizing Five Forks, the key to control of the South Side Railroad, a vital supply line and evacuation route.

After the Battle of Dinwiddie Court House (March 31) at about 10:00 pm, V Corps infantry began to arrive near the battlefield to reinforce Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry. Pickett&#x27;s orders from his commander General Robert E. Lee were to defend Five Forks &quot;at all hazards&quot; because of its strategic importance.

At about 1:00 pm, Sheridan pinned down the front and right flank of the Confederate line with small arms fire, while the massed V Corps of infantry, commanded by Major General Gouverneur K. Warren, attacked the left flank soon afterwards. Owing to an acoustic shadow in the woods, Pickett and cavalry commander Major General Fitzhugh Lee did not hear the opening stage of the battle, and their subordinates could not find them. Although Union infantry could not exploit the enemy&#x27;s confusion, owing to lack of reconnaissance, they were able to roll up the Confederate line by chance, helped by Sheridan&#x27;s personal encouragement. After the battle, Sheridan controversially relieved Warren of command of V Corps, largely due to private enmity. Meanwhile, the Union held Five Forks and the road to the South Side Railroad, causing General Lee to abandon Petersburg and Richmond, and begin his final retreat.

==Background==
===Military situation===

===Siege of Petersburg===

The 292-day Richmond–Petersburg Campaign (Siege of Petersburg) began when two corps of the Union Army of the Potomac, which were unobserved when leaving Cold Harbor at the end of the Overland Campaign, combined with the Union Army of the James outside Petersburg, but failed to seize the city from a small force of Confederate defenders at the Second Battle of Petersburg on June 15–18, 1864. Union General-in-Chief Ulysses S. Grant then had to conduct a campaign of trench warfare and attrition in which the Union forces tried to wear down the smaller Confederate Army, destroy or cut off sources of supply and supply lines to Petersburg and Richmond and extend the defensive lines which the outnumbered and declining Confederate force had to defend to the breaking point. The Confederates were able to defend Richmond and the important railroad and supply center of Petersburg, Virginia, south of Richmond for over nine months against a larger force by adopting a defensive strategy and skillfully using trenches and field fortifications.

After the Battle of Hatcher&#x27;s Run on February 5–7, 1865, extended the lines another , Lee had few reserves after manning the lengthened defenses. Lee knew that his defenses would soon become unsustainable and the best chance to continue the war was for part or all of his army to leave the Richmond and Petersburg lines, obtain food and supplies at Danville, Virginia, or possibly Lynchburg, Virginia, and join General Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s force opposing Major General William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s army in North Carolina. If the Confederates could quickly defeat Sherman, they might turn back to oppose Grant before he could combine his forces with Sherman&#x27;s. Lee began preparations for the movement and informed Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Confederate States Secretary of War John C. Breckinridge of his conclusions and plan.

Under pressure from President Jefferson Davis to maintain the defenses of Richmond, and in any event unable to move effectively over muddy roads with poorly fed animals in winter, General Lee accepted a plan by Major General John B. Gordon to launch an attack on Union Fort Stedman designed to break Union lines east of Petersburg or at least compel Grant to shorten the Union Army lines. If this were accomplished, Lee would have a better chance to shorten the Confederate lines and send a substantial force, or nearly his whole army, to help Johnston.

Gordon&#x27;s surprise attack on Fort Stedman in the pre-dawn hours of March 25, 1865, captured the fort, three adjacent batteries and over 500 prisoners while killing and wounding about 500 more Union soldiers. The Union IX Corps under Major General John G. Parke promptly counterattacked. The IX Corps recaptured the fort and batteries, forced the Confederates to return to their lines and in places to give up their advance picket line. The IX Corps inflicted about 4,000 casualties, including about 1,000 captured, which the Confederates could ill afford.

Gains by the II Corps and VI Corps on the afternoon of March 25, at the Battle of Jones&#x27;s Farm, capturing Confederate picket lines near Armstrong&#x27;s Mill and extending the left end of the Union line about closer to the Confederate fortifications, put the VI Corps within about of the Confederate line. After the Confederate defeats at Fort Stedman and Jones&#x27;s Farm, Lee knew that Grant soon would move against the only remaining Confederate supply lines to Petersburg, the South Side Railroad and the Boydton Plank Road, and possibly cut off all routes of retreat from Richmond and Petersburg.

==Beginning of Appomattox Campaign==
===Grant&#x27;s orders===

On March 24, 1865, the day before the Confederate attack on Fort Stedman, Grant already had planned for an offensive to begin March 29, 1865. The objectives were to draw the Confederates out into a battle where they might be defeated and, if the Confederates held their lines, to cut the remaining road and railroad supply and communication routes between areas of the Confederacy still under Confederate control and Petersburg and Richmond. The Battle of Fort Stedman had no effect on his plans. The Union Army lost no ground due to the attack, did not need to contract their lines and suffered casualties that were a small percentage of their force.

Grant ordered Major General Edward Ord to move part of the Army of the James from the lines near Richmond to fill in the line to be vacated by the II Corps under Major General Andrew A. Humphreys at the southwest end of the Petersburg line before that corps moved to the west. This freed two corps of Major General George Meade&#x27;s Army of the Potomac for offensive action against Lee&#x27;s flank and railroad supply lines: Major General Andrew A. Humphrey&#x27;s II Corps and the V Corps commanded by Major General Gouverneur K. Warren. Grant ordered the two infantry corps, along with Major General Philip Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry corps, still designated the Army of the Shenandoah, under Sheridan&#x27;s command, to move west. Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry consisted of two divisions commanded by Brigadier General Thomas Devin and Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) George Armstrong Custer but under the overall command of Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Wesley Merritt, as an unofficial corps commander, and the division of Major General George Crook detached from the Army of the Potomac. Grant&#x27;s objectives remained the same although he thought it unlikely the Confederates would be drawn into open battle.

===Lee&#x27;s orders===
Confederate General-in-chief Robert E. Lee, who was already concerned about the ability of his weakening army to maintain the defense of Petersburg and Richmond, realized that the Confederate defeat at Fort Stedman would encourage Grant to make a move against his right flank and communication and transportation routes. On the morning of March 29, 1865, Lee already had prepared to send some reinforcements to the western end of his line and had begun to form a mobile force of about 10,600 infantry, cavalry and artillery under the command of Major General George Pickett and cavalry commander Major General Fitzhugh Lee. This force would go beyond the end of the line to protect the key junction at Five Forks from which a Union force could access the remaining open Confederate roads and railroads.

===Union troop movements===
Before dawn on March 29, 1865, Warren&#x27;s V Corps moved west of the Union and Confederate lines while Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry took a longer, more southerly route toward Dinwiddie Court House. Humphrey&#x27;s II Corps filled in the gap between the existing end of the Union line and the new position of Warren&#x27;s corps. Warren&#x27;s corps led by Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain&#x27;s First Brigade of Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Charles Griffin&#x27;s First Division of the V Corps proceeded north on the Quaker Road toward its intersection with the Boydton Plank Road and the Confederates&#x27; nearby White Oak Road Line.

===Battle of Lewis&#x27;s Farm===
Along Quaker Road, across Rowanty Creek at the Lewis Farm, Chamberlain&#x27;s men encountered brigades of Confederate Brigadier Generals Henry A. Wise, William Henry Wallace and Young Marshall Moody which had been sent by Fourth Corps commander Lieutenant General Richard H. Anderson and his only present division commander, Major General Bushrod Johnson, to turn back the Union advance. A back-and-forth battle ensued during which Chamberlain was wounded and almost captured. Chamberlain&#x27;s brigade, reinforced by a four-gun artillery battery and regiments from the brigades of Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Edgar M. Gregory and Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Alfred L. Pearson, who was later awarded the Medal of Honor, drove the Confederates back to their White Oak Road Line. Casualties for both sides were nearly even at 381 for the Union and 371 for the Confederates.

After the battle, Griffin&#x27;s division moved up to occupy the junction of the Quaker Road and Boydton Plank Road near the end of the Confederate White Oak Road Line. Late in the afternoon of March 29, 1865, Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry occupied Dinwiddie Court House on the Boydton Plank Road without opposition. The Union forces had cut the Boydton Plank Road in two places and were close to the Confederate line and in a strong position to move a large force against both the Confederate right flank and the crucial road junction at Five Forks in Dinwiddie County to which Lee was just sending Pickett&#x27;s mobile force defenders. The Union Army was nearly in position to attack the two remaining Confederate railroad connections with Petersburg and Richmond, if they could take Five Forks.

Encouraged by the Confederate failure to press their attack at Lewis&#x27;s Farm and their withdrawal to their White Oak Road Line, Grant decided to expand Sheridan&#x27;s mission to a major offensive rather than just a possible battle or a railroad raid and forced extension of the Confederate line.

===Battle of White Oak Road===
On the morning of March 31, General Lee inspected his White Oak Road Line and learned that the Union left flank held by Brigadier General Romeyn B. Ayres&#x27;s division had moved forward the previous day and was &quot;in the air.&quot; A wide gap also existed between the Union infantry and Sheridan&#x27;s nearest cavalry units near Dinwiddie Court House. Lee ordered Major General Bushrod Johnson to have his remaining brigades under Brigadier General Henry A. Wise and Colonel Martin L. Stansel in lieu of the ill Young Marshall Moody, reinforced by the brigades of Brigadier Generals Samuel McGowan and Eppa Hunton, attack the exposed Union line.

Stansel&#x27;s, McGowan&#x27;s and Hunton&#x27;s brigades attacked both most of Ayres&#x27;s division and all of Crawford&#x27;s division which quickly had joined the fight as it erupted. In this initial encounter, two Union divisions of over 5,000 men were thrown back across Gravelly Run by three Confederate brigades. Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Charles Griffin&#x27;s division and the V Corps artillery under Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Charles S. Wainwright finally stopped the Confederate advance short of crossing Gravelly Run. Adjacent to the V Corps, Major General Andrew A. Humphreys conducted diversionary demonstrations and sent two of Brigadier General Nelson Miles&#x27;s brigades from his II Corps forward. They initially surprised and, after a sharp fight, drove back Wise&#x27;s brigade on the left of the Confederate line, taking about 100 prisoners.

At 2:30 pm, Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain&#x27;s men forded the cold, swollen Gravelly Run, followed by the rest of Griffin&#x27;s division and then the rest of Warren&#x27;s reorganized corps. Under heavy fire, Chamberlain&#x27;s brigade, along with Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Edgar M. Gregory&#x27;s brigade, charged Hunton&#x27;s brigade and drove it back to the White Oak Road Line, allowing Chamberlain&#x27;s and Gregory&#x27;s men across White Oak Road. The remainder of the Confederate force then had to withdraw to keep itself from being outflanked and overwhelmed. Warren&#x27;s corps ended the battle again across a section of White Oak Road between the end of the main Confederate line and Pickett&#x27;s force at Five Forks, cutting direct communications between Anderson&#x27;s (Johnson&#x27;s) and Pickett&#x27;s forces. Union casualties (killed, wounded, missing – presumably mostly captured) were 1,407 from the Fifth Corps and 461 from the Second Corps and Confederate casualties have been estimated at 800.

===Battle of Dinwiddie Court House===

About 5:00 p.m. on March 29, 1865, Union Major General Philip Sheridan led two of his three divisions of Union cavalry, totaling about 9,000 men counting the trailing division, unopposed into Dinwiddie Court House, Virginia, about west of the end of the Confederate lines and about south of the important road junction at Five Forks, Virginia. Sheridan planned to occupy Five Forks the next day. That night, under orders from General Robert E. Lee, Confederate Major General Fitzhugh Lee led his cavalry division from Sutherland&#x27;s Station to Five Forks to defend against an anticipated Union drive to the South Side Railroad, which would be intended to end use of that important final Confederate railroad supply line to Petersburg. Fitzhugh Lee arrived at Five Forks with his division early on the morning of March 30 and headed toward Dinwiddie Court House.

On March 30, 1865, in driving rain, Sheridan sent Union cavalry patrols from Brigadier General Thomas Devin&#x27;s division to seize Five Forks, the key junction for reaching the South Side Railroad. Devin&#x27;s force unexpectedly found and skirmished with units of Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s cavalry division. That night Confederate Major General George Pickett reached Five Forks with about 6,000 infantrymen in five brigades (under Brigadier Generals William R. Terry, Montgomery Corse, George H. Steuart, Matt Ransom and William Henry Wallace) and took overall command of the operation as ordered by General Lee. The cavalry divisions of Major Generals Thomas L. Rosser and W. H. F. &quot;Rooney&quot; Lee arrived at Five Forks late that night. Fitzhugh Lee took overall command of the cavalry and put Colonel Thomas T. Munford in charge of his own division.

The rain continued on March 31. Under Sheridan&#x27;s direction, Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Wesley Merritt sent two of Devin&#x27;s brigades toward Five Forks and held one brigade in reserve at J. Boisseau&#x27;s farm. Sheridan sent brigades or detachments from Major General George Crook&#x27;s division to guard two fords of a swampy stream just to the west, Chamberlain&#x27;s Bed, in order to protect the Union left flank from surprise attack and to guard the major roads. Dismounted Union troopers of Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Charles H. Smith&#x27;s brigade armed with Spencer repeating carbines held up Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s cavalry attack at the southern ford, Fitzgerald&#x27;s Ford. At about 2:00 pm, Pickett&#x27;s force crossed the northern ford, Danse&#x27;s Ford, against a small force from Brigadier General Henry E. Davies&#x27;s brigade, which was left to hold the ford while much of the brigade unnecessarily moved to help Smith and could not return fast enough to help the few defenders.

Union brigades and regiments fought a series of delaying actions throughout the day but were consistently eventually forced to withdraw toward Dinwiddie Court House. The brigades of Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Alfred Gibbs and Brigadier General John Irvin Gregg, later joined by Colonel Smith&#x27;s brigade, held the junction of Adams Road and Brooks Road for two to three hours. Meanwhile, Sheridan had called up Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) George Armstrong Custer with two brigades of his division under Colonels Alexander C. M. Pennington, Jr. and Henry Capehart. Custer set up another defensive line about north of Dinwiddie Court House, which together with Smith&#x27;s and Gibbs&#x27;s brigades, held off the attack by Pickett and Fitzhugh Lee until darkness ended the battle. Both armies initially stayed in position and close to each other after dark. The Confederates intended to resume the attack in the morning.

The Confederates did not report their casualties and losses. Historian A. Wilson Greene has written that the best estimate of Confederate casualties in the Dinwiddie Court House engagement is 360 cavalry, 400 infantry, 760 total killed and wounded. Union officers&#x27; reports showed that some Confederates also were taken prisoner. Sheridan suffered 40 killed, 254 wounded, 60 missing, total 354. Pickett lost Brigadier General William R. Terry to a disabling injury. Terry was replaced as brigade commander by Colonel Robert M. Mayo.

==Battle==
===V Corps and Mackenzie&#x27;s division join Sheridan===
Early in the evening of March 31, 1865, Union V Corps commander, Major General Gouverneur K. Warren, recognized from the sound of battle that Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry was being pushed back at Dinwiddie Court House and sent Brigadier General Joseph J. Bartlett&#x27;s brigade to reinforce Sheridan. Moving cross country, Bartlett&#x27;s men drove Confederate pickets from Dr. Boisseau&#x27;s farm, just east of Crump Road. Since the Gravelly Run bridge on the Boydton Plank Road had been wrecked by the Confederates, Pearson was delayed. At about 8:20 pm, Warren told Meade about the needed bridge repair and possible delay but Meade did not pass the information to Sheridan.

Meade told Warren to have his entire force ready to move. By 9:17 pm, Warren was ordered to withdraw from the line and send a division to Sheridan at once. At 9:45 pm, Meade first advised Grant of Bartlett&#x27;s forward location at Dr. Boisseau&#x27;s farm and inquired of Grant whether Warren&#x27;s entire corps should go to help Sheridan. Meade did not tell Grant that the plan to move Warren&#x27;s entire corps to Sheridan&#x27;s aid was Warren&#x27;s idea.

When Grant then notified Sheridan that the V Corps and Ranald Mackenzie&#x27;s division from the Union Army of the James had been ordered to his support, he gratuitously and without any basis said that Warren should reach him &quot;by 12 tonight.&quot; It was impossible for the tired V Corps soldiers to cover about on dark, muddy roads with a bridge out over Gravelly Run along the way in about an hour. Through the night, no one gave Sheridan accurate and complete information about Warren&#x27;s dispositions, logistical situation and when he received his orders. Nonetheless, Warren&#x27;s supposed failure to meet his schedule was something for which Sheridan would hold Warren to account.

When Mackenzie&#x27;s division reached Dinwiddie Court House about dawn, Sheridan ordered them to rest since they had been on the road since 3:30 am.

Meade&#x27;s further order to send Griffin&#x27;s division down the Boydton Plank Road and Ayres&#x27;s and Crawford&#x27;s divisions to join Bartlett at Dr. Boisseau&#x27;s farm so they could attack the rear of the Confederate force did not acknowledge the large Confederate force at Dr. Boisseau&#x27;s farm and the needed repair of the Gravelly Run bridge. Meade learned of the Gravelly Run bridge problem when the telegraph was restored at about 11:45 pm. Warren also received information from a staffer that a Confederate cavalry force under Brigadier General William P. Roberts held the junction of Crump Road and White Oak Road, threatening to hold up or stop a direct move by the V Corps to Dinwiddie Court House or Five Forks.

Warren rejected Meade&#x27;s suggestion to consider alternate routes because it would take too long to move his corps, even considering the existing delays. Ayres had received Warren&#x27;s order to move to the Boydton Plank Road at about 10:00 pm. This required him to move over about two miles of rough country and cross a branch Gravelly Run. Warren allowed Crawford&#x27;s and Griffin&#x27;s men to rest where they were until he learned that Ayres&#x27;s division had made contact with Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry.

Warren was told that the new Gravelly Run bridge was completed at 2:05 am. Ayres&#x27;s division arrived at Sheridan&#x27;s position near dawn. As predicted by Warren, the effect of Bartlett&#x27;s appearance threatening Pickett&#x27;s flank was enough for Pickett to withdraw to Five Forks, which the Confederates had done by the time Ayres reach Dinwiddie Court House. One of Sheridan&#x27;s staff officers met Ayres and told him that his division should have turned on to Brooks Road, a mile back. Ayres returned to Brooks Road, where a lone Confederate picket promptly fled as the division approached and, after Sheridan rode up for a brief meeting with Ayres, Ayres&#x27;s men settled down for a rest until 2:00 pm.

At 4:50 am, Warren received Sheridan&#x27;s 3:00 a.m. message to cooperate with the cavalry by hitting Pickett&#x27;s retreating men in the flank and rear. This was similar to the plan Warren had proposed earlier in the evening but which had been given no consideration by Grant and Meade at that time. Warren personally began to arrange the move of Griffin&#x27;s and Crawford&#x27;s divisions. Warren had to carefully move Griffin&#x27;s and Crawford&#x27;s divisions because of the possibility of attack from the Confederates as the men withdrew from the White Oak Road Line and again at positions near Dinwiddie Court House where Confederates had been positioned while in contact with the Union cavalry earlier. Warren personally supervised Crawford&#x27;s division&#x27;s withdrawal and movement, leaving Warren at the end of the column when the troops moved. Despite Warren&#x27;s problems and Pickett&#x27;s earlier retreat which would have prevented Warren from reaching him short of Five Forks, Sheridan blamed Warren for slow movements which gave Pickett the time to complete his retreat.

About 5:00 am, Griffin&#x27;s division was told to move to the left to J. Boisseau&#x27;s house. Since Warren did not definitely know that Pickett had withdrawn his force, he still thought Griffin could intercept the Confederates. Griffin moved Chamberlain&#x27;s brigade at the head of his column in line of battle with great care because Griffin thought they might strike the Confederate force if they emerged from White Oak Road while his division moved toward Crump Road. The Confederates did not attack and Griffin advanced on Crump Road. With a Confederate counterattack still thought to be possible as Crawford moved, Warren remained with Crawford until he reached Crump Road when Warren perceived that the Confederates from the White Oak Road Line were not going to wait for or follow the moving Union division.

Sheridan was upset that a chance to strike Pickett was lost and was even more upset to find out from Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain at the head of Griffin&#x27;s column at about 7:00 a.m. that Warren was at the end of the column. Sheridan exclaimed: &quot;That is where I should expect him to be!&quot; Warren&#x27;s men knew this was an unfair comment because Warren had never shown a lack of personal bravery. Chamberlain&#x27;s further explanation about why Warren was in that position seemed to calm Sheridan at the time. Warren thought he was doing what he should to be sure that disengagement of his corps in close contact with the enemy was made carefully. Sheridan instructed Griffin to place his men south of J. Boisseau&#x27;s farm, while Ayres&#x27;s remained south of Griffin. Crawford&#x27;s division arrived soon thereafter. After seeing Crawford off and checking for any men or wagons not moving in the right direction, Warren and his staff then rode to join Griffin at about 9:00 am. Meanwhile, Griffin had met Devin&#x27;s cavalry division at J. Boisseau&#x27;s where he stopped his division and reported to Sheridan who was at the scene.

At 6:00 am, Meade&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Alexander S. Webb, had sent an order to Warren to report to Sheridan for further orders, which officially transferred Warren and his corps to Sheridan&#x27;s command at that time. Two of Warren&#x27;s divisions had reported to Sheridan within an hour of the dispatch of that message. A staff officer rode up to Warren at about 9:00 a.m. and handed him Webb&#x27;s message. At the same time that Webb sent this message to Warren, 6:00 am, Meade sent a telegram to Grant stating that Warren would be at Dinwiddie soon with his whole corps and would require further orders. Warren reported to Meade on the successful movement of the corps and stated that while he had not personally met with Sheridan, Griffin had spoken with him. Warren did not personally meet with Sheridan until 11:00 am. The failure of Warren to immediately report directly to Sheridan may have contributed to his being relieved from command later on April 1. At their brief meeting, Sheridan told Warren to hold his men at J. Boisseau&#x27;s farm but expressed some displeasure with Warren&#x27;s remarks during the meeting.

When Sheridan soon moved off to the front, he accepted distorted reports that the Confederate works were stronger than they were and extended further than they did. He did not want to scout them further because he thought his plans might be given away by such activity. This left the mistaken impression that the Confederate line extended about further to the east than it actually did.

===Pickett withdraws to Five Forks===
When Pickett became aware that Union infantry divisions were arriving near his flank at about 10:00 pm, he withdrew to his modest log and dirt defensive line about 1.75 miles (2.8 km) north at Five Forks. The Confederates withdrew between 2:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., covered by Munford&#x27;s cavalry and with Custer&#x27;s men close behind but not forcing an engagement.

After Pickett returned to Five Forks on the morning of April 1, 1865, he surmised that the Union forces were organizing to attack his left flank. He later recalled that he sent a telegram to General Robert E. Lee asking for reinforcements and a diversion to prevent his force from being isolated by Sheridan&#x27;s men coming between his force and the end of the White Oak Road defenses. Pickett also said that he would have deployed north of Hatcher&#x27;s Run had he not received a telegram from General Lee that, according to many historians, stated:

Historian Edward G. Longacre discounts the reliability of the report of this message, saying it was recalled 30 years later by Pickett&#x27;s widow, who tended to exaggerate, distort and falsify her husband&#x27;s records. He wrote that Pickett&#x27;s report only mentions Lee&#x27;s direction to protect the road to Ford&#x27;s Depot and that no copy of the message has ever been found, which historian Douglas Southall Freeman also had noted in 1944.

Robert E. Lee knew that if the Union Army could take Five Forks, they would be able to reach the South Side Railroad and the Richmond and Danville Railroad, cutting the major supply routes to and retreat routes from Petersburg and Richmond, cut the wagon roads to the west and circle around Hatcher&#x27;s Run and attack the Confederate right flank. Even if it were not the best location for a defense, Five Forks had to be defended. Pickett later wrote that he assumed Lee had his message and would make a helpful diversion and send reinforcements.

The slow withdrawal and narrow roads kept the last of the Confederate force from reaching Five Forks until midmorning on April 1. When the Confederates reached Five Forks, they began to improve the trenches and fortifications, including establishing a return or refusal of the line running north of the left or eastern side of their trenches. While particular attention was given to improving the refused left flank, Pickett did not have the line that initially had been constructed when his men had reached Five Forks substantially improved after his men returned from Dinwiddie Court House. The location of the line was not well chosen because some of it was in low places.

===Disposition of Confederate force===
Not only did the Confederate line at Five Forks consist only of slim pine logs with a shallow ditch in front but Pickett&#x27;s disposition of his force was poor. The cavalry in particular were poorly placed in wooded areas inundated by heavy streams so that they could only move to the front by a narrow road. The artillery was poorly placed by Pickett, especially Colonel Willie Pegram&#x27;s three guns set at the center of the line. At the Warren Court of Inquiry 24 years later, Fitzhugh Lee said the Confederates made less careful dispositions than usual along White Oak Road at Five Forks because they expected to face only cavalry or to be supported by Lieutenant General Richard Anderson&#x27;s corps if Union infantry left their lines to support Sheridan&#x27;s force. Historian Ed Bearss has written that Fitzhugh Lee and Pickett either did not know the result of the Battle of White Oak Road or failed to realize its significance. Two of Major General Bushrod Johnson&#x27;s brigades, from Anderson&#x27;s only division, already were with Pickett and the troops left at White Oak Road and Claiborne Road were weakened and cut off to the west after the battle. General Lee decided to send no reinforcements to Pickett because he had no notification that Pickett&#x27;s force was in trouble.

Pickett&#x27;s line across Five Forks was dug mainly just north of White Oak Road, with a &quot;refused&quot; (bent back) left flank. It extended about about half on each side of the junction of White Oak Road with Dinwiddie Court House Road (Ford&#x27;s Road to the north) and Scott Road. Pickett placed W. H. F. &quot;Rooney&quot; Lee&#x27;s cavalry on the right of the line with Rufus Barringer&#x27;s brigade watching the right flank at the western edge of Gilliam&#x27;s farm. From right to left the line was held by the brigades of Brigadier General Montgomery Corse, Colonel Robert M. Mayo, who replaced the injured Brigadier General William R. Terry, and Brigadier Generals George H. Steuart, William Henry Wallace and Matt Ransom. On the left flank, the 8th Virginia Cavalry Regiment from Colonel Thomas T. Munford&#x27;s division was in contact with the understrength cavalry brigade led by the Confederate Army&#x27;s youngest general, Brigadier General William Paul Roberts. This small unit of a regiment plus a battalion was assigned to cover the between the end of Pickett&#x27;s line and the end of the main Confederate defensive line at the junction of Claiborne Road and White Oak Road. The rest of Munford&#x27;s division was positioned on Ford&#x27;s Road behind the center of the line at Five Forks. Three of artillery Colonel Willie Pegram&#x27;s six guns were placed along the line where fields of fire in the wooded location could be found, with the other three placed in battery at Five Forks. Four guns of Major William M. McGregor&#x27;s Battalion were put on the right flank. Thomas L. Rosser&#x27;s division was in reserve, watching the wagon train north of Hatcher&#x27;s Run. Rosser later recalled that he asked for this assignment because his horses had been ridden hard and needed attention.

===Pursuit of Pickett&#x27;s force===
At dawn on April 1, 1865, Custer reported to Sheridan that his scouts had found that the Confederates had withdrawn from their positions in front of the line confronting the final Union defensive line set up on the evening of March 31 about north of Dinwiddie Court House. After Pickett&#x27;s withdrawal, Sheridan planned to attack the Confederates at Five Forks as soon as possible. Sheridan ordered Merritt to pursue Pickett&#x27;s force with Custer&#x27;s and Devin&#x27;s divisions. Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) William Wells&#x27;s brigade of Custer&#x27;s division was recalled from guarding the wagon train.

When Custer reached the junction of Adams Road and Brooks Road with Pennington&#x27;s and Capehart&#x27;s brigades, he found Ayres&#x27;s division of Warren&#x27;s corps had arrived at that location about dawn. Due to the wet ground, Merritt decided to deploy Custer&#x27;s men dismounted and move them cross country to turn the Confederate right flank. Custer moved his men forward with Pennington&#x27;s brigade on the left and Capehart&#x27;s on the right, with Chamberlain&#x27;s Bed and Bear Swamp to the cavalrymen&#x27;s left. Custer&#x27;s troopers captured a few Confederate stragglers and drove off a patrol guarding the Scott Road crossing of Bear Swamp. When Custer&#x27;s men approached within several hundred yards of the Confederate defensive line at White Oak Road, he decided not to attack the apparently strong defenses but to send out combat patrols to test the line. They could not find a weak spot in the line so Custer told his men to hold their ground.

When Custer&#x27;s troops moved off the Dinwiddie Court House Road, Merritt sent Devin&#x27;s force up that road to J. Boisseau&#x27;s farm where they met Griffin&#x27;s division, which had begun to arrive about 7:00 am, with Crawford&#x27;s division following soon thereafter. After Devin had met with Griffin, he moved toward Five Forks. Stagg&#x27;s brigade discovered that Confederate infantry held the crossing of Chamberlain&#x27;s Bed in force. Devin then sent Fitzhugh&#x27;s dismounted brigade to ford the creek and establish a position on the other side. Stagg then sent his mounted force along with the 1st U.S. Cavalry Regiment to follow Fitzhugh&#x27;s men across while the rest of Gibbs&#x27;s brigade covered the right flank and rear of the division. Devin then sent the dismounted brigade flanked by the mounted troopers to take a wooded area between Chamberlain&#x27;s Bed and White Oak Road. The mounted men got within of the Confederate line and some of the dismounted men even briefly crossed the line and brought back some prisoners before being driven off. Stagg dismounted his brigade and moved them into the line. Gibbs&#x27;s brigade also was brought forward to oppose the center of the Confederate line and was dismounted except for one regiment, the 1st U.S. Cavalry.

Custer&#x27;s division was on the left of the Union line and its farthest right brigade, Pennington&#x27;s, was at first in contact with Stagg&#x27;s 1st Michigan Cavalry from Devin&#x27;s division but the 1st Michigan moved off to look for the rest of their brigade which was in the middle of Devin&#x27;s line. Pennington then moved back to reform his line and to move to the right in thick woods about south of the Confederate line. After this move, Pennington was across Scott Road from Fitzhugh&#x27;s brigade, rather than from Stagg&#x27;s brigade. The dismounted troopers threw up log breastworks while waiting for further orders.

Wells&#x27;s brigade of Custer&#x27;s division arrived at Dinwiddie Court House with the wagons at 11:00 am. After Wells allowed his men to rest until 1:00 pm, they moved up to the battle line to report to Custer. Davies&#x27;s and Smith&#x27;s brigades of Crook&#x27;s division were assigned to guard the wagon trains when Wells&#x27;s brigade moved forward. One of Davies&#x27;s regiments was sent to watch the Boydton Plank Road bridge across Stony Creek. Gregg&#x27;s brigade of Crook&#x27;s division was sent across Chamberlain&#x27;s Bed at Fitzgerald&#x27;s Ford to seize Little Five Forks. That junction controlled the roads to the left and rear of Custer&#x27;s division. Gregg sent out patrols to be sure the Confederates could not make a surprise attack on Sheridan&#x27;s left flank.

===Grant sends Sheridan permission to relieve Warren===
Just before noon, one of Grant&#x27;s staff, Lieutenant Colonel Orville E. Babcock, told Sheridan:

Sheridan replied to Babcock that he hoped that would not be necessary. Grant had issued the order in part because a staff officer mistakenly reported to him at about 10:00 a.m. that Warren&#x27;s corps still was held up at Gravelly Run. Warren did not hear about Grant&#x27;s message but some word leaked out to V Corps generals including Griffin and Chamberlain.

===Sheridan&#x27;s plan of attack; V Corps called up===
Sheridan then planned an attack whereby Custer would feint toward the Confederate right flank with Capehart&#x27;s brigade, Warren&#x27;s infantry corps would attack the left flank and Devin, joined by Pennington&#x27;s brigade, would make a frontal attack on the Confederate entrenchments when they heard Warren&#x27;s attack begin. Sheridan sent a staff officer to order up the V Corps and an engineer, Captain George L. Gillespie, to turn the front of Warren&#x27;s Corps into Gravelly Run Church road obliquely to and a short distance from White Oak Road, about east of Five Forks. In the Warren Court of Inquiry in 1880, Gillespie testified that contrary to Sheridan&#x27;s after action report, he had made no reconnaissance of the Confederate line and did not know there was a &quot;return&quot; on the left flank. He only knew he was to align the V Corps with the right flank of Devin&#x27;s division and have them positioned as a turning column a short distance from White Oak Road and about east of Five Forks.

Gillespie reached Warren at J. Boisseau&#x27;s farm at 1:00 p.m. with Sheridan&#x27;s instructions. Upon hearing Sheridan&#x27;s order, Warren sent Colonel Henry C. Bankhead to have the division commanders move up at once. Bankhead gave Crawford and Griffin the message and sent another officer to contact Ayres while he waited to see that the orders were obeyed as promptly as possible by the divisions at the farm.

Warren went to see Sheridan who briefly and tersely explained to him the tactical situation and plan of operations. Warren then rode to examine the ground where his men were to be massed on Gravelly Run Church Road and he sent his escort to patrol as far as White Oak Road to prevent the Confederates from discovering the V Corps&#x27; movement.

Sheridan told Warren to advance with his entire corps in a two-division front oblique to the road with the third division following in reserve. He wanted the attack in a single blow and not piecemeal. Otherwise, Warren could determine the number of assault waves and length of the line. Warren decided that each division should put two brigades in front in double battle lines with their third brigade centered behind the first two. Warren&#x27;s corps would cover about a front with about 12,000 officers and men, reduced from 15,000 by casualties, detachments and stragglers over the past 3 days.

Crawford&#x27;s division reached Gravelly Run Church first and deployed as Warren instructed. Griffin&#x27;s division arrived soon after Crawford&#x27;s. Warren showed him where to set up and asked him to be as expeditious as possible in forming his line. Ayres&#x27;s division arrived last and Warren also asked him at least twice to move expeditiously.

If the angle or &quot;return&quot; in the Confederate line had been where Warren was led to believe it was, Crawford&#x27;s men would hit it first and Griffin would be with him to reinforce the attack. Ayres division would prevent the Confederate troops in the earthworks facing White Oak Road from reinforcing Ransom&#x27;s brigade which was holding the return. Warren prepared a sketch map of the presumed situation for the division commanders. Warren had to draw up the orders in reliance on what he was told about the location of the Confederate line and without making a personal reconnaissance. Colonel James W. Forsyth, Sheridan&#x27;s chief of staff said that Sheridan also saw a copy of Warren&#x27;s diagram and instructions and approved them. The instructions directed the corps to advance northwestwardly to the White Oak Road, wheel to the left, take a position at right angles to the road and that as soon as they were engaged, Custer&#x27;s and Devin&#x27;s men were to charge along the rest of the line. No cavalry were on the right with the V Corps but Mackenzie&#x27;s troopers were reported to be advancing on White Oak Road toward the V Corps&#x27; position.

The ground where the V Corps formed was rough, wooded and filled with ravines. Since the Confederate breastworks could not be seen from this location, the direction of advance depended on the roads and supposed location of the Confederate works along White Oak Road.

Warren &quot;used all exertions possible&quot; to get his troops to the point of departure. The march appeared to be off to a good start. Griffin received his orders at 2:00 pm. The division marched over a narrow, woody road, arriving at the marshaling area about 4:00 pm, which most observers agreed was reasonable time, especially since the road was muddy and blocked by led horses of dismounted cavalry. Sheridan came to visit Warren during the V Corps organizational movements and expressed concern that Warren get ready before his cavalry fired all their ammunition. Warren offered to move with those troops which were ready if Sheridan so directed, but Sheridan wanted all the infantry to attack at once.

Sheridan felt that Warren was not exerting himself to get the corps into position and stated in his after action report that he was anxious for the attack to begin as the sun was getting low and there was no place to entrench. Warren denied Sheridan&#x27;s allegation that Warren had given the impression he wanted the sun to go down before the attack could be made and that there were 2.5 hours of daylight still left at 4:00 pm.

===Mackenzie disperses Roberts&#x27;s cavalry===
While the V Corps was organizing for its attack, Sheridan was further disturbed to learn that Meade had pulled Miles&#x27;s division from the White Oak Road line back to the Boydton Plank Road, opening the possibility that Confederate reinforcements could come down White Oak Road and strike the V Corps in the flank and rear. Sheridan called up Mackenzie&#x27;s division. They moved up the Adams and Dinwiddie Court House Roads to J. Boisseau&#x27;s and turned on to the Crump Road, intending to move to the White Oak Road and set up a roadblock, with Major James E. McFarlan&#x27;s battalion of the 11th Pennsylvania Cavalry in the lead.

About south of White Oak Road and east of Five Forks, Mackenzie&#x27;s troopers encountered a considerable force of Roberts&#x27;s men posted in rifle pits along the edge of a wood along White Oak Road with an open field to their front. Rapid fire from Mackenzie&#x27;s men who were armed with Spencer repeating carbines kept the Confederates pinned down and allowed Mackenzie personally to lead Major Robert S. Monroe&#x27;s battalion of the 11th Pennsylvania Cavalry on horseback across the rifle pits into White Oak Road, striking the left flank of the Confederate line. The North Carolina cavalrymen retreated in confusion as the remainder of the 11th Pennsylvania Cavalry charged the Confederate cavalry&#x27;s line. Union brigade commander Colonel Samuel P. Spear was wounded in the mopping up operation.

When he was informed of Mackenzie&#x27;s success, Sheridan ordered Mackenzie to leave a detachment to block White Oak Road and to bring his division to Five Forks. When Mackenzie reached a position near the Confederate line and was about to order his lead brigade to charge, the V Corps started across White Oak Road, briefly delaying both units&#x27; progress to their positions.

===Pickett, Fitzhugh Lee away at shad bake===
From north of Hatcher&#x27;s Run, Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s other division commander, Thomas L. Rosser, invited Lee and Pickett to a shad bake lunch. Rosser had brought a large catch of shad on ice from the Nottoway River when his division moved from that station to Five Forks. Pickett and Lee accepted. At 2:00 pm, as Lee was about to leave the line, Munford came up to report a dispatch from a lieutenant of the 8th Virginia Cavalry who wrote that Roberts&#x27;s cavalry brigade stationed to the east along the White Oak Road had been overpowered by Union cavalry. Some of Roberts&#x27;s men fled into Pickett&#x27;s line while others retreated into Anderson&#x27;s end of the main Confederate White Oak Road line at Claiborne and White Oak roads. The dispersal of Roberts&#x27;s command meant that Pickett was cut off and if any reinforcements were sent, they would need to fight their way through on White Oak Road to reach his position or take a very circuitous route. Fitzhugh Lee asked Munford to check this personally and to order up his division if necessary and report back. Munford then saw Lee riding with Pickett north on Ford&#x27;s Road toward Hatcher&#x27;s Run but had no knowledge of their destination, which was about north of the front.

After Pickett and Fitzhugh Lee had departed, Major General Rooney Lee was the senior officer in charge, though he was at the far right of the line and did not know he was in charge. With Rooney Lee in overall command, Colonel Munford, who was better located in any event, would be the senior cavalry officer, while Brigadier General Steuart was the ranking infantry commander. None of these officers knew that Pickett and Fitzhugh Lee were at the rear having a lengthy lunch and that they should assume additional duties.

Soon after Pickett and Fitzhugh Lee left for lunch, Colonel Munford saw the Union attack shaping up as he prepared to have his cavalry division defend the left flank against the attack. Munford sent several couriers to look for Pickett or Fitzhugh Lee to tell them of the impending attack but they could not be found. Captain Henry Lee of Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s staff also could not find them. Munford had his division dismount, and deployed it on the left of Ransom&#x27;s refused line. Each Confederate unit commander prepared for the attack as best he could, not always in co-operation with each other.

===Ayres starts V Corps attack; Sheridan at front===
When Ayres finished aligning his men, about 4:15 pm, the order was given for the attack. Sheridan, Warren and Colonel Porter rode at the front of Ayres&#x27;s division. Union skirmishers drove in the Confederate outposts. Ayres was told by a staff officer that there were indications of the enemy to the left. Ayres alerted his reserve brigade commander Brigadier General Frederick Winthrop to be ready to bring his brigade forward.

As Ayres&#x27;s men crossed White Oak Road, they ran into Mackenzie&#x27;s approaching cavalry. Sheridan had ordered Mackenzie to strike toward Hatcher&#x27;s Run, turn west and occupy Ford&#x27;s Road, covering the V Corps&#x27; right flank. Warren soon realized that the V Corps had crossed White Oak Road east of the left of the Confederate line and Crawford&#x27;s division was starting to diverge from Ayres&#x27;s. Warren thought that the Confederate line must be in the edge of the woods, about from the road and continued to lead the corps toward the northwest.

Ransom&#x27;s Confederate brigade began to fire on Ayres&#x27;s division after they crossed White Oak Road and entered a field beyond. This established that the Confederate line was not immediately across White Oak Road from Gravelly Church Road but to west of that intersection. The bad information about the location of the Confederate line had put the V Corps&#x27; march off target, with two of the three divisions past the end of the Confederate line but in a position to strike from the rear.

Warren later recalled that Ransom&#x27;s brigade was in a thick belt of woods, which disrupted their aim and reduced initial Union casualties. The Confederate refused left flank was shorter than in length. Ayres realized the situation soon after the attack began and changed his front to the left to face the return (bend) of the line. The movement of Colonel Richard N. Bowerman&#x27;s brigade to the left opened a space in the line which Ayres filled with Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Frederick Winthrop&#x27;s brigade which had started in reserve. Ayres then led the line in the attack. Crawford, however, failed to adjust his movement when Ayres changed his front and Griffin continue to follow Crawford north and west through the woods.

Ayres&#x27;s men had faltered briefly when they became exposed to closer, more accurate firing from Ransom&#x27;s brigade. Sheridan then rode along the battle line shouting encouragement. When a soldier was hit in the neck and fell shouting &quot;I&#x27;m killed!&quot; Sheridan called to him &quot;You&#x27;re not hurt a bit, pick up your gun, man, and move right on to the front.&quot; Reacting to Sheridan&#x27;s words, the man stood up, picked up his gun and moved a dozen paces before he finally collapsed dead.

Ayres&#x27;s right flank brigade under Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) James Gwyn had moved well ahead of Crawford&#x27;s division and began to waver as the troops realized they might be exposed to a flank attack. On his horse, Sheridan called for his battle flag. He rode among the soldiers shouting encouragement, threats, profanities and orders to close ranks. His color sergeant was killed. Another staff officer was wounded and at least two other staff officers&#x27; horses were killed. Sheridan and Ayres and his officers managed to quickly get the troops under control and order them forward again. This time some of Ransom&#x27;s defenders broke for the rear. McGregor&#x27;s gunners limbered up their four artillery pieces and pulled out just as Ayres&#x27;s men came over the earthworks. Ayres&#x27;s men killed or captured all of Ransom&#x27;s men who had not fled.

As some of his men got away from the crumbling line, Ransom had to be freed from under his wounded and grounded horse. An officer in one of Ransom&#x27;s regiments later wrote: &quot;The Yankees simply run over us and crowded us so that it became impossible to shoot.&quot; The color-sergeant of the 190th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment planted the first Union flag on the Confederate line.

Sheridan jumped his horse over the berm and landed among Confederates who had thrown down their weapons and were waiting to surrender. When they asked him what to do, Sheridan pointed to the rear and said: &quot;Go over there. Get right along, now. Drop your guns; youll never need them any more. You&#x27;ll be safe over there. Are there any more of you? We want every one of your fellows.&quot; Ayres had taken the key to the entire Confederate line, over 1,000 prisoners and eight battle flags but among the Union casualties was Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Frederick Winthrop who was mortally wounded and Colonel Richard N. Bowerman who was severely wounded. Colonel James Grindley assumed command of Winthrop&#x27;s brigade while Colonel David L. Stanton took charge of Bowerman&#x27;s brigade.

Soon after Sheridan jumped his horse into the Confederate works, an orderly reported to him that Colonel Forsyth of his staff had been killed. Sheridan replied; &quot;It&#x27;s no such thing. I don&#x27;t believe a word of it. You&#x27;ll find Forsyth&#x27;s alright.&quot; Ten minutes later, Forsyth rode up and Sheridan shouted: &quot;There! I told you so.&quot; Sheridan ordered Ayres to halt and reform his division. When it was obvious that the Confederate line in fact had given way, Sheridan ordered Ayres to move forward.

===Warren searches for Griffin, Crawford===
When Griffin&#x27;s and Crawford&#x27;s divisions diverged from Ayres, Ayres sent a message to Griffin to come up on his right. Sheridan also sent orders to Griffin and Crawford to come in on the right. Warren sent staff officers in pursuit of them. Warren established a command post in the field east of the return where he thought he could get information from all points and exercise control of the whole field assigned to his corps. Sheridan, however, thought Warren should have been leading from the front. When the staff officers did not report back promptly, Warren himself went looking for the wayward divisions. He was fired upon when he reached a local landmark, the &quot;Chimneys&quot;, about north of the end of the Confederate refused line, by the volleys that caused Gwyn&#x27;s brigade to recoil.

Crawford&#x27;s division had come in several hundred yards from the road before they wheeled to the left, entirely missing the approximately Confederate return line. Warren first found Colonel John A. Kellogg&#x27;s brigade and told him to form his brigade at right angles to its previous direction and wait until another brigade could close up on his right. Warren and his staff officers could not find Crawford to tell him to move his other brigades. When Warren came back from the woods, Kellogg was gone, having been ordered forward by one of Sheridan&#x27;s staff officers who was also searching for Crawford. A patrol of Munford&#x27;s cavalry stopped Kellogg&#x27;s advance from positions inside the Sydnor house. Colonel Jonathan Tarbell brought up a battalion of the 91st New York Infantry Regiment which drove out Munford&#x27;s men and allowed Kellogg&#x27;s brigade to resume their move to the west.

One of Warren&#x27;s staff officers, Major Emmor B. Cope found Crawford and had him swing to the right to join Kellogg. Since Kellogg had moved, Crawford proceeded toward the Chimneys, with the brigades of Brigadier General Henry Baxter and Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Richard Coulter, encountering a few of Munford&#x27;s pickets as they progressed. Crawford then found and moved against Munford&#x27;s dismounted troopers, which still moved Crawford toward the northwest away from the main Confederate line.

===Griffin joins the main attack===
Warren finally found Griffin about north of the return at the Chimneys. Griffin had pushed ahead of Crawford&#x27;s division and had gone even further to the right of the end of the refused segment of the Confederate line. Griffin realized something was wrong when he did not come up against fortifications after marching about and only finding Munford&#x27;s outposts as opposition.

Brigadier General Joseph J. Bartlett of Griffin&#x27;s division rode to the left when he heard increased firing and saw the Confederate left flank on the opposite side of Sydnor&#x27;s field. Griffin also rode to Sydnor&#x27;s field and saw the Confederate movement along White Oak Road. Major Cope then rode up and told Griffin that Warren wanted him to move toward White Oak Road by the left flank. Meanwhile, all of Griffin&#x27;s men except three regiments of Bartlett&#x27;s brigade had moved off and joined Crawford&#x27;s division.

Griffin then led Bartlett&#x27;s three regiments across Sydnor&#x27;s field. Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain saw the division flag moving to the left and followed Griffin with his brigade and a regiment of Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Edgar M. Gregory&#x27;s brigade. By the time Warren returned to White Oak Road, Ayres&#x27;s division had captured the return. Since no attack was now needed at the return (refused end) of the Confederate line, Warren sent Major Cope to tell Griffin to push westward toward the Ford&#x27;s Road. Griffin turned his men to the right and headed west parallel to White Oak Road. Warren then turned back toward the return to look again for Crawford&#x27;s division.

===Second Confederate left flank line breached===
The collapse of Ransom&#x27;s brigade put both Wallace&#x27;s and Steuart&#x27;s brigades in danger of being outflanked and attacked from the rear. The three Confederate brigadier generals quickly threw up a new defensive line with light field works at a right angle to White Oak Road in the woods at the west end of Sydnor&#x27;s field in order to protect Ford&#x27;s Road. Griffin&#x27;s brigade soon charged against this line with Chamberlain&#x27;s brigade and one of Gregory&#x27;s regiments on the left, Bartlett&#x27;s brigade on the right and two of Gregory&#x27;s regiments behind. When Chamberlain&#x27;s men attacked, their right wing overcame the new Confederate line and then a Union regiment and a battalion headed toward White Oak Road while Griffin&#x27;s remaining troops maintained their pressure on that part of the Confederate line which was still holding out. Another of Chamberlain&#x27;s regiments and a battalion continued to pressure the Confederate line. Bartlett&#x27;s regiments met stiff resistance and even engaged in hand-to-hand fighting. Some of Bartlett&#x27;s men took cover in rifle pits where Chamberlain&#x27;s men had broken the line. Griffin&#x27;s men succeeded in breaking the line after a fight of about half an hour.

The generals and staff officers had to reform Bartlett&#x27;s brigade and deploy the men at right angles to the Confederate line so they would not be trapped if the Confederates managed a counterattack. Chamberlain rushed two regiments to help. Together, these units put the Confederates to flight, taking about 1,500 prisoners and several battle flags. Bartlett and Chamberlain reorganized 150 to 200 stragglers and put them back into the battle. Chamberlain saw Colonel Gwyn&#x27;s battle flag to the rear and asked Gwyn to have his brigade assist Chamberlain&#x27;s men, which Gwyn did. Suddenly confronted by a large number of Confederates, Chamberlain feared being caught in a cross-fire when the Confederates suddenly threw down their arms and surrendered.

===Sheridan orders Ayres, Griffin, Chamberlain forward===
As the second Confederate return line collapsed, Ayres and Sheridan came forward. Sheridan ordered Chamberlain to take command of all the infantry in the vicinity and to push for Five Forks. He did so with the help of one of Griffin&#x27;s staff officers. After being cautioned by Sheridan and Ayres that his men were firing into their own cavalry, Chamberlain told Sheridan that he should go to a safer place. Instead, Sheridan rode west on White Oak Road, following Griffin and Bartlett who had just come up.

Griffin had not paused with the victory at the second defensive line but continued to advance to Five Forks where he met the dismounted troopers of Pennington&#x27;s and Fitzhugh&#x27;s brigades who had just broken through the Confederate fortifications. Ayres&#x27;s division then reached Five Forks as well. On the right, Bartlett&#x27;s brigade reached Ford&#x27;s Road and captured an ambulance and wagon train.

===Crawford moves forward; Warren searches again===
Crawford&#x27;s troops also moved steadily across Ford&#x27;s Road from the northern end of Sydnor&#x27;s field and captured seven ambulances and some wagons from Wallace&#x27;s brigade. Crawford sent these wagons with many prisoners to the rear so fast that Crawford&#x27;s provost marshal could not keep an accurate count of them.

After Ayres&#x27;s division had captured the return, Warren again went to search for Crawford. He found Crawford&#x27;s division in good order on the east side of the Boisseau farm, facing west. Unfortunately for Warren, Sheridan asked for Warren at about this time and no one could say where he was. Sheridan then ordered Griffin to take command of the corps. Meanwhile, Warren ordered Crawford to wheel to the left and drive south against Five Forks because Warren perceived that the Confederates still held the crossroads because of artillery fire coming from that direction. Coulter&#x27;s brigade led the attack on the left of Ford&#x27;s Road with Kellogg&#x27;s and Baxter&#x27;s brigades and four of Bartlett&#x27;s separated regiments coming up on the right. From woods on the south of the Boisseau farm, the Confederates fired steadily on the Union battle line. Three companies of the 1st Maine Veteran Infantry Regiment routed a patrol of Rosser&#x27;s cavalry across Hatcher&#x27;s Run before rejoining their regiment. Warren assigned the 1st Maine Veteran Infantry Regiment and the 118th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment to watch the ford across Hatcher&#x27;s Run.

===Pickett learns of attack; rides back to battle===
During the shad bake lunch at Rosser&#x27;s camp, two of Munford&#x27;s pickets rode up to report that Union forces were advancing on all roads. Fitzhugh Lee and Pickett decided that since they could not hear an attack, due as it turned out to the thick pine forest and heavy atmosphere between the camp and Five Forks and an acoustic shadow, there was little to worry about. Soon after 4:00 pm, Pickett asked Rosser for a courier to take a message to Five Forks. Not long after that, two couriers were dispatched, the officers heard gunfire and saw the lead courier captured by Union horsemen on Ford&#x27;s Road just across Hatcher&#x27;s Run. Then they saw a Union Army battle line coming toward the road.

Pickett crossed the ford just as some of Munford&#x27;s cavalrymen were falling back with Kellogg&#x27;s brigade pressing them closely. Pickett appealed to his cavalrymen to hold back the Union attackers long enough so he could get to the front. A small group of the Confederate cavalrymen, led by Captain James Breckinridge, who was killed, charged the advancing Union soldiers, giving Pickett enough time to pass using the horse&#x27;s head and neck as a shield. Getting to the ford a little later than Pickett, Fitzhugh Lee was unable to cross as Kellogg&#x27;s men had occupied Ford&#x27;s Road by that time. Lee then tried to attack the roadblock with Rosser&#x27;s reserve division but they failed to breach the Union line, so Lee deployed the division north of Hatcher&#x27;s Run in an effort to keep the Union force from using Ford&#x27;s Road to reach the South Side Railroad.

Pickett found that his subordinates, Ransom, Steuart and Wallace, had formed a new line parallel to and east of Ford&#x27;s Road and were fighting with Griffin&#x27;s division.

===Third Confederate left flank formed, collapses===
Pickett pulled Mayo&#x27;s brigade from the line west of Five Forks along with Graham&#x27;s two guns to shore up the line and added stragglers from Ransom&#x27;s and Wallace&#x27;s brigades to the line in order to man a third line of resistance east of Ford&#x27;s Road. Coulter&#x27;s Union brigade faced fierce fire from Mayo&#x27;s brigade and Graham&#x27;s battery but continued to advance with the support of Crawford&#x27;s two other brigades and two of Bartlett&#x27;s regiments.

Mayo&#x27;s brigade broke when Coulter&#x27;s men rushed into the woods and over their line, although Mayo was able to reform part of the brigade in Gilliam&#x27;s field. Seeing the disordered condition of Mayo&#x27;s brigade, and although the Confederates still controlled the Five Forks intersection, Pickett gave up the fight at Ford&#x27;s Church Road and ordered Mayo to go across country to the South Side Railroad. Coulter&#x27;s brigade took a large number of prisoners from Mayo&#x27;s brigade and captured Graham&#x27;s two guns.

After Mayo&#x27;s brigade had been broken, Warren told Crawford to oblique his division to the right and occupy White Oak Road west of Five Forks to close the last line for Confederate retreat. Custer&#x27;s and Rooney Lee&#x27;s divisions were engaged in fierce combat to the southwest of Crawford. Crawford&#x27;s left flank passed north of Five Forks and Warren split off for Five Forks. Warren met the 1st U.S. Cavalry Regiment riding up Ford&#x27;s Road and instructed them to file to the left and march to support Crawford.

===Corse, Rooney Lee cover Confederate withdrawal===
When Pickett sent Mayo off the field, he called for Corse&#x27;s brigade to come from the front and deploy on the west side of Gilliam&#x27;s field at a right angle to White Oak Road. The Union forces would need to cross this open field to advance. Pickett&#x27;s objective was to gain time for the survivors of the shattered brigades of Ransom, Steuart and Wallace to escape. Corse&#x27;s men threw up light field works and Barringer&#x27;s and Beale&#x27;s brigades of Rooney Lee&#x27;s cavalry division supported them to the south and west.

Mackenzie&#x27;s cavalry had advanced on the right of the V Corps and scattered Munford&#x27;s picket line as well as screening the infantry from any attempt by Rosser&#x27;s division north of Hatcher&#x27;s Run to come in from behind. Mackenzie had to pause twice to break up pockets of resistance. The Union cavalrymen captured large numbers of prisoners during their advance. At about 9:00 pm, Mackenzie halted and reported his location to Sheridan. Sheridan sent instructions to have a cavalry detail relieve the infantry detachment then guarding the Hatcher&#x27;s Run ford on Ford&#x27;s Road.

After Munford and his remaining troopers crossed Hatcher&#x27;s Run, they remounted, crossed back and rode to the right to report to Pickett. Realizing that they only could get trapped by continuing to fight, Pickett ordered Munford to rejoin Fitzhugh Lee north of Hatcher&#x27;s Run. They did so after recrossing the run to the west at W. Dabney&#x27;s Road and reported to Fitzhugh Lee after dark.

===Union cavalry attack===
In line with Sheridan&#x27;s order, Merritt ordered Devin and Custer to dismount their men and charge the Confederate works as soon as they heard the sound of battle from the infantry attack. They were to leave one brigade each on horseback to exploit any breakthrough. Devin&#x27;s men and Pennington&#x27;s brigade of Custer&#x27;s division attacked the fortifications along White Oak Road when they heard the infantry&#x27;s attack. Pennington was at Custer&#x27;s command post where Custer told him to call for his &quot;led horses&quot; so he could support Custer&#x27;s flank attack, contrary to Merritt&#x27;s orders that he should attack dismounted along with Devin&#x27;s men.

Within minutes of speaking with Custer, Pennington heard the sound of firing, followed by the appearance of a staff officer who told him that Merritt had sent Pennington&#x27;s brigade into the attack. Custer said he must be mistaken and rode off. Pennington headed for the front only to find that his brigade in fact had attacked, faltered and was pulling back in confusion. In his after action report, Pennington said the failure to maintain contact with Fitzhugh&#x27;s brigade, the removal of Capehart&#x27;s division from his left, and the fact that his men were running out of ammunition caused the retreat. With Pennington&#x27;s brigade no longer on his left, Devin had to pull his division back. While the Union forces regrouped, Devin supplied Pennington&#x27;s men with more ammunition and the Union attack was resumed. After renewing their attack, Pennington&#x27;s brigade fell back again but Devin&#x27;s division continued their attack against Steuart&#x27;s and Wallace&#x27;s brigades.

After Ayres&#x27;s division broke the Confederate line, Steuart and Wallace had to withdraw a large number of their troops to man the new defensive line at right angles to White Oak Road. Nonetheless, Pennington&#x27;s men were being held back at the breastworks and Sheridan halted them temporarily because he was concerned that Ayres&#x27;s men would fire into them. It was only after Mayo&#x27;s brigade was pulled out of the front line to form the third left flank line that Pennington&#x27;s brigade made progress.

===Five Forks taken; Pegram killed===

The guns at Five Forks and part of Steuart&#x27;s brigade still held the intersection. Colonel Pegram had posted his three guns to the west of Ford&#x27;s Road in a little salient as directed by Pickett, then went to sleep. When the firing started, Pegram woke up and rushed to the Five Forks intersection. Pegram&#x27;s three cannon fired at the charging Union cavalrymen, who were firing at the artillerists with repeating carbines. Pegram rode out between the guns to give orders without dismounting and, after shouting &quot;Fire your canister low, men!,&quot; was mortally wounded. Pegram died the following morning.

The Confederate detachments from Mayo&#x27;s, Steuart&#x27;s and Wallace&#x27;s brigades could not carry on holding the front of the Confederate line when Union troops from Griffin&#x27;s division appeared on their left to add weight to the attack by the Union cavalrymen who charged over the fortifications as Griffin&#x27;s men came up. Devin then sent the mounted 1st U.S. Cavalry regiment after the fleeing Confederates. The Union cavalry division commanders reported that they captured almost 1,000 prisoners and seized two battle flags and two guns during the battle.

After the Union cavalry broke the front line at the Five Forks intersection, Griffin&#x27;s and Ayres&#x27;s infantry divisions arrived at the scene, causing some disorder as units intermingled. After restoring organization to their commands, Devin wheeled his division to the left and set up on Griffin&#x27;s left while Ayres&#x27;s division was behind Griffin&#x27;s. Then the Union battle line moved to the west of the junction.

===Miles blocks White Oak Road===
At 5:30 p.m. on April 1, Grant sent Brigadier General Nelson Miles&#x27;s division of the II Corps to hold White Oak Road at Claiborne Road and prevent reinforcements moving to Pickett over White Oak Road.

===Custer held off; pursues Fitzhugh Lee===
Before the Union attack began, Custer positioned Capehart&#x27;s and Wells&#x27; brigades opposite the Confederate right and remounted them as ordered by Merritt. Custer then told the 15th New York Cavalry Regiment to make a feint against the end of the main line held by Corse&#x27;s brigade. Custer planned to lead the rest of the men of the two brigades in an attack on the Confederate flank. Corse had been reinforced by a dismounted brigade from Rooney Lee&#x27;s cavalry division. The 15th New York was turned back twice as they tried to reach Confederate cannons that were firing canister.

Custer began his flank attack when the 15th New York Cavalry began their attack on the front and swung his mounted brigades around the Confederate flank. Before Custer could seize a position behind Corse, Rooney Lee led the 2nd North Carolina Cavalry (19th State Troops) and 3rd North Carolina Cavalry (41st State Troops) in a counterattack. Lee&#x27;s troopers held their position, keeping Custer from joining the Union forces moving west along the Confederate line. Covered by Rooney Lee&#x27;s troopers from Barringer&#x27;s brigade, McGregor&#x27;s battery, many infantry, wagons and ambulances and Beale&#x27;s cavalry brigade withdrew north of Hatcher&#x27;s Run.

===Warren leads a final charge===

Warren found Crawford&#x27;s division hesitating at the edge of the woods on the east side of Gilliam&#x27;s field at the same time Custer&#x27;s division was being held back by Rooney Lee&#x27;s men to the south and west. The Union soldiers were not heeding officers&#x27; orders to move forward against Corse&#x27;s line of breastworks. After a few minutes for reorganization of the units, Warren took the corps flag and rode into the field with his staff officers and called for the men to follow. The men then rose and followed their officers and color bearers to attack Corse&#x27;s brigade, capturing many prisoners and dispersing the other Confederates. In the attack, Warren&#x27;s horse was shot from under him just short of the Confederate line, an orderly was killed and Lieutenant Colonel Hollon Richardson of the 7th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment was badly wounded when he jumped his horse between Warren and the Confederate defenders.

After Corse&#x27;s brigade had been scattered, Crawford&#x27;s men moved west on White Oak Road about . After mopping up a few pockets of resistance, Warren halted the pursuit since no more Confederates could be seen and night was falling. Warren had earlier sent his aide, Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Locke, to tell Sheridan he had gained the enemy&#x27;s rear, taken over 1,500 prisoners and was pushing in a division as fast as he could. Sheridan told Locke: &quot;Tell General Warren, by God! I say he was not at the front. That is all I have got to say to him.&quot;

When Pickett ordered Corse to the west side of Gilliam&#x27;s field, he ordered Rooney Lee to prepare to withdraw to the South Side Railroad. Lee covered his dismounted men with his mounted men and fought a successful delaying action as he slowly retreated. He had to speed up as Corse&#x27;s brigade collapsed. Yet, Custer could not cut off many of Lee&#x27;s men, who crossed Hatcher&#x27;s Run at W. Dabney Road and then marched to Ford&#x27;s Road to report to Fitzhugh Lee. Custer followed Lee&#x27;s men for about but gave up and set up camp on the battlefield, where Pennington&#x27;s brigade rejoined them, as darkness closed in.

===Casualties===
Historians offer a range of casualties. Some are similar to Earl J. Hess&#x27;s numbers of about 600 killed and wounded, 4,500 prisoners and thirteen flags and six guns lost by the Confederates and 633 casualties for Warren&#x27;s infantry and &quot;probably...fewer&quot; for Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry. Noah Andre Trudeau gives the same number of Union infantry casualties and a total of 830 Union casualties with 103 killed, 670 wounded, 57 missing. Trudeau gives a &quot;more modern accounting.&quot; Although earlier than Hess&#x27;s account, Greene and several other historians state that the Confederates lost about 605 killed and wounded and 2,400 taken prisoner. A. Wilson Greene later gives the same figures. Chris Calkins also cites the lower estimate of Confederate prisoners. John S. Salmon gives Union casualties as 830 and Confederate casualties as 605 plus 2,000 to 2,400 taken prisoner for a total of about 3,000 lost. This is nearly identical to the National Park Service figures.

==Aftermath==
===Confederate survivors move toward railroad===

The survivors of the Confederate infantry brigades moved north through the woods and fields to ford Hatcher&#x27;s Run and moved over the W. Dabney road to a position near the South Side Railroad. After some order was restored to the intermingled mass of survivors, Pickett moved the men in their re-formed units toward Exeter Mills at the mouth of Whippornock Creek where he planned to ford the Appomattox River and return to the Army of Northern Virginia.

===Sheridan relieves Warren of command===

After Crawford&#x27;s division was halted, Warren asked for Colonel Bankhead to report to Sheridan on what had occurred and ask for further instructions. Soon afterwards, at about 7:00 pm, Colonel George A. Forsyth of Sheridan&#x27;s staff rode up and handed Warren this message: &quot;Major-General Warren, commanding Fifth Army Corps, is relieved of duty, and will report at once for orders to General Grant, commanding Armies of the United States.&quot; In his after action report, Sheridan cited what he perceived to be Warren&#x27;s lack of effort in getting his troops ready for the attack at the staging area at Gravelly Run Church. The wavering of Gwyn&#x27;s brigade in the attack on the return also angered Sheridan because he believed it resulted from a lack of confidence because Warren did not make enough effort to inspire it. Sheridan also drafted an order putting Griffin in charge of the V Corps, Bartlett in charge of Griffin&#x27;s division and Pearson in charge of Bartlett&#x27;s brigade and directing them to pursue the Confederates down White Oak Road. By this time the victory was complete and Sheridan and Griffin had reached Five Forks.

A stunned Warren rode to Sheridan&#x27;s command post to ask for reconsideration. Sheridan blustered in reply: &quot;Reconsider? Hell! I don&#x27;t reconsider my determination. Obey the order.&quot; Warren&#x27;s officers and men were surprised by this action and some wrote defenses of Warren near the time of the battle or later, blaming the action on Sheridan&#x27;s jealousy because of Warren&#x27;s role in the victory. Considering the 1883 verdict of the Warren Court of Inquiry that Sheridan&#x27;s removal of Warren was unjustified, many historians also have stated that Sheridan&#x27;s action was unjust.

===Porter reports victory to Grant; Grant orders general assault===
Colonel Horace Porter, Grant&#x27;s staff officer and observer of the battle, started back for Grant&#x27;s headquarters at about 7:30 pm. He excitedly reported the victory and told Grant over 5,000 prisoners were taken. The victory at Five Forks opened the road to the South Side Railroad for the Union troops. As soon as Grant learned of the victory, at about 8:00 pm, he ordered Meade to have Humphreys with the II Corps and Parke with the IX Corps ready to push ahead to keep Confederates from escaping from Petersburg and converging on Sheridan. Grant told the officers at his headquarters that he had ordered a general assault along the lines.

Meade asked Grant for clarification because Grant had ordered a 4:00 a.m. attack all along the line. Grant said both Humphreys and Parke should feel for a chance to push on that night, that Humphreys should send skirmishers forward and attack if the Confederates were leaving their positions. If the Confederates held their line, Grant said that Humphreys should send Miles&#x27;s division down White Oak Road to reinforce Sheridan. Grant also directed that Wright, Parke and Ord, with John Gibbon&#x27;s XXIV Corps from the Army of the James, should begin an artillery barrage on the Confederate lines. The corps commanders and Ord reported their men could not see well enough to attack. At 10:00 pm, Union artillery opened fire on the Confederate lines opposite the Petersburg lines until 2:00 am. The Confederates did not leave the lines and the Union assault began at about 4:40 am.

===Grant sends Confederate flags to Lincoln===
In the absence of available aides, Grant sent reporter Sylvanus Cadwallader of the &quot;New York Herald&quot; to bring the news of the victory at Five Forks along with captured battle flags to President Lincoln aboard the &quot;River Queen&quot; at City Point. Lincoln took the flags and said: &quot;Here is something material – something I can see, feel and understand. This means victory. This &quot;is&quot; victory.&quot; By this time, the Union artillery barrage had started and Lincoln remained awake. When he finally fell asleep he had the dream in which he saw himself dead in the White House, killed by an assassin.

===Lee learns of defeat, sends troops west to railroad===
After the battle on the night of April 1, Fitzhugh Lee informed Robert E. Lee of the defeat and rout at Five Forks from Church&#x27;s Crossing near the Ford Church&#x27;s Road junction with the South Side Railroad where the remaining forces of Rooney Lee and Thomas Rosser joined him. Lee sent Lieutenant General Richard H. Anderson with his infantry to help Pickett reorganize and hold the South Side Railroad. Anderson left a small force behind and left Burgess Mill to join Fitzhugh Lee at about 6:30 p.m. Anderson arrived about 2:00 a.m. on April 2. General Lee&#x27;s intention was to defend the South Side Railroad at Sutherland&#x27;s Station. Anderson&#x27;s force included Major General Bushrod Johnson&#x27;s division, Brigadier General Eppa Hunton&#x27;s brigade of Pickett&#x27;s command, and the survivors of Pickett&#x27;s task force at Five Forks. Lee also ordered troops from Richmond to come to Petersburg to help defend against attacks which he thought to be imminent.

===Grant sends Miles division to Sheridan; Sheridan&#x27;s plan===
On the night of April 1, two divisions of the Union V Corps camped across White Oak Road near Gravelly Run Church while the third division camped near Ford&#x27;s Road. Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry camped at the Gilliam Farm near Five Forks while Mackenzie&#x27;s men settled in near the Ford&#x27;s Road crossing of Hatcher&#x27;s Run. Nelson A. Miles&#x27;s division of Andrew Humphrey&#x27;s II Corps joined Sheridan later that night.

Grant sent a message to Sheridan late on April 1 that he was sending Miles&#x27;s division to him and that he planned an attack along the Petersburg lines at 4:00 am. Grant said he could give Sheridan no specific instructions but &quot;would like you however to get something done to the South Side Road even if they do not tear up a mile of it.&quot; Sheridan replied at 12:30 a.m. that he planned to sweep the White Oak Road and all north of it down to Petersburg.

On April 2, Union attacks, especially the successful assault by Major General Horatio G. Wright&#x27;s VI Corps, broke through the Confederate lines at the Third Battle of Petersburg, putting the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia to flight toward Appomattox Court House and surrender on April 9, 1865.

===Medal of Honor recipients===
The Union Army soldiers Wilmon W. Blackmar, John Wallace Scott, Robert F. Shipley, Thomas J. Murphy, August Kauss, William Henry Harrison Benyaurd, Jacob Koogle, George J. Shopp, Joseph Stewart, William W. Winegar, Albert E. Fernald, Adelbert Everson, James G. Grindlay, Charles N. Gardner, Henry G. Bonebrake, Hiram H. De Lavie and David Edwards were all later awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the battle.

<text>The Areopagus () is a prominent rock outcropping located northwest of the Acropolis in Athens, Greece. Its English name is the Late Latin composite form of the Greek name Areios Pagos, translated &quot;Hill of Ares&quot; (). The name &quot;Areopagus&quot; also referred, in classical times, to the Athenian governing council, later restricted to the Athenian judicial council or court that tried cases of deliberate homicide, wounding, and religious matters, as well as cases involving arson of olive trees, because they convened in this location.
The war god Ares was supposed to have been tried by the other gods on the Areopagus for the murder of Poseidon&#x27;s son Halirrhothius (a typical example of an aetiological myth).

==History==

The exact origin of the Areopagus as an institution remains unclear. In pre-classical times (before the 5th century BC), the Areopagus may have been a council of elders for the city of Athens, with membership restricted by constitutional conventions to those who had held high public office, in this case that of Archon. Conversely, it may have also begun almost exclusively as a homicide court and judicial body. While there is no consensus, homicide trials seem to have been held by Athenians on the Areopagus hill as early as the 7th century BC and possibly as far back as the mid-8th century BC.

In 594 BC, the Areopagus Council was heavily restructured by Solon, as was the rest of the Athenian state apparatus. Aristotle suggests that Solon confirmed its competence over cases of treason (, εἰσαγγελία) and its guardianship of the laws (, νομοφυλακία). Solon&#x27;s entrusting of the to the Areopagus Council may imply that the council was invested with maintaining the stability of his reforms after he left Athens.

Under the reforms of Cleisthenes, enacted in 508/507 BC, the Boule (βουλή) or council was expanded from 400 to 500 men, and was formed of 50 men from each of the ten clans or (φυλαί) of Attica. There is very little evidence to suggest that Cleisthenes may have altered the composition or the jurisdiction of the Areopagus Council, given that he himself was likely a council member.

Cleisthenes significantly influenced the Areopagus by establishing the Council of Five Hundred and implementing ostracism, which reduced aristocratic power and encouraged citizen involvement in governance. These reforms transformed the Areopagus into a judicial body, emphasizing justice within the democratic framework. By organizing citizens into demes, Cleisthenes further ensured broader representation, solidifying the Areopagus&#x27;s role in Athenian democracy.

In 462/461 BC, Ephialtes may have put through reforms which deprived the Areopagus Council of almost all its functions - except that of a murder tribunal - in favour of the Heliaia. While this perception is corroborated by most ancient authors, it may have merely been a retrojection by those writing long after the 5th century BC. This is because there is little evidence to suggest that the Areopagus Council had done anything of note to warrant an attack on its powers by the time of Ephialtes. Nevertheless, over the course of the 5th century BC, the Areopagus Council did lose its competence over and (δοκιμασία), the initial examination of those elected into office, though it is unknown if this was because of Ephialtes.

In &quot;The Eumenides&quot; of Aeschylus (458 BC), the Areopagus is the site of the trial of Orestes for killing his mother (Clytemnestra) and her lover (Aegisthus). While this is a dramatization of the trials that would have taken place at the Areopagus, it is the only surviving tragedy that most closely resembles what Athenian citizens would recognize as a judicial proceeding. Most general happenings are the same but with a unique twist, such as the presiding officer being the goddess Athena and all prosecutors being female and divine as well. Although, one notable inconsistency in this drama is that, in the fifth-century, Orestes would not have been tried at the Areopagus council since he was claiming to have killed his mother &#x27;with justice&#x27; rather than asserting that he had not killed her. A case of this nature would instead come before the &quot;ephetai&quot; at the Delphinium.

Phryne, a hetaera of the 4th century BC who was famed for her beauty, appeared before the Areopagus Court accused of profaning the Eleusinian mysteries. One story has her letting her cloak drop and so impressing the judges with her almost divine form that she was summarily acquitted.

In the second half of the 4th century BC, the Areopagus Court grew in influence and political power, and contributed to the anti-Macedonian faction in Athens. It conducted an investigation on charges of treason and bribery (, ἀπόφασις) against Demosthenes as a result of the Harpalus affair in 324 BC. At the same time, the Areopagus as an institution may have also regained power over the , which had been lost to reforms in the 5th century BC.

The Areopagus Council continued to function as a body of former archons in Roman times. After Sulla&#x27;s capture of Athens in 86/87 BC and subsequent restructuring of the city&#x27;s political structure, it was elevated to one of the most prestigious and politically powerful institutions in Athens. The Roman statesman Cicero once said of the council, &quot;when one says &#x27;the Athenian state is ruled by the council,&#x27; the words &#x27;of the Areopagus&#x27; are omitted.&quot;

Acts 17:16-34 prominently features the Areopagus as the setting for the Apostle Paul&#x27;s Areopagus sermon during his visit to Athens, notably leading to the conversion of Dionysius the Areopagite. However, it is unclear whether Paul gave his speech before the Areopagus Council in the setting of a judicial investigation or trial, or on the physical location of the Areopagus hill as an informal speech. The Areopagus Council likely would not have met on the actual Areopagus hill by the time of Paul&#x27;s visit, but rather in the agora or in the Stoa Basileios.

The Areopagus ceased operation as a political council by at least the early 5th century AD, according to Theodoret of Cyrus.

After the closure of the Council, the Areopagus hill was occupied by various houses and dwellings while under Byzantine rule. Buildings of note on the hill during this time included a church and monastery - both dedicated to Dionysios the Areopagite.

The term &quot;Areopagus&quot; also refers to the judicial body of aristocratic origin that subsequently formed the higher court of modern Greece.

Near the Areopagus was also constructed in the mid-19th century AD by the Roman Catholic Church the Cathedral Basilica of St. Dionysius the Areopagite.

<doc id="204592" wikidata="Q161802" url="?curid=204592" title="Atropa">
<text>Atropa is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae: tall, calcicole, herbaceous perennials (rhizomatous hemicryptophytes), bearing large leaves and glossy berries particularly dangerous to children, due to their combination of an attractive, cherry-like appearance with a high toxicity. Atropa species favour temperate climates and alkaline soils, often growing in light shade in woodland environments associated with limestone hills and mountains. Their seeds can remain viable in the soil for long periods, germinating when the soil of sites in which plants once grew (but from which plants have long been absent) is disturbed by human activity or by natural causes, e.g. the windthrow of trees (a property shared by the seeds of other Solanaceae in tribe Hyoscyameae e.g. those of Hyoscyamus spp., the henbanes). The best-known member of the genus Atropa is deadly nightshade (&quot;A. belladonna&quot;) – the poisonous plant &quot;par excellence&quot; in the minds of many. The pharmacologically active ingredients of Atropa species include atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine, all tropane alkaloids having anticholinergic, deliriant, antispasmodic and mydriatic properties. The genus is named for Άτροπος (&quot;Atropos&quot;) – lit. &#x27;she who may not be turned (aside)&#x27; – one of the Three Fates and cutter of the thread of life / bringer of death – in reference to the extreme toxicity of &quot;A.belladonna&quot; and its fellow species – of which four others are currently accepted.

In some older classifications, the mandrake (&quot;Mandragora officinarum&quot;) has been placed in the genus &quot;Atropa&quot;, under the binomial &quot;Atropa mandragora&quot;.

==Species==
Six species and one natural hybrid are accepted.
* &quot;Atropa acuminata&quot; – Indian belladonna/&quot;maitbrand&quot; (Kashmir and adjoining regions of India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, also N. Iran). Endangered.
* &quot;Atropa baetica&quot; – Andalusian belladonna / &quot;tabaco gordo&quot; / &quot;tabba&quot; (S. and S.E. Spain and W. North Africa). Endangered.
* &quot;Atropa belladonna&quot; – Belladonna/deadly nightshade (Europe, West Asia and North Africa). A very variable species with a very extensive distribution, the which factors have contributed to the description of species not currently accepted.
* &quot;Atropa indobelladonna&quot; – Arunachal Pradesh in the eastern Himalayas
* &quot;Atropa komarovii&quot; – Turkmenistan belladonna (Kopet Dag range dividing Iran from Turkmenistan and adjoining regions in N.E. (Caspian) Iran). Distinctive in that flowers borne singly.
* &quot;Atropa × martiana&quot; (&quot;A. baetica&quot; × &quot;A. belladonna&quot;) – Morocco and east-central and southern Spain
* &quot;Atropa pallidiflora&quot; – Hyrcanian belladonna (Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests, notably those of Mazandaran province, N. Iran, also Afghanistan).

The genus &quot;Atropa&quot; is currently under review, so changes in nomenclature are likely, once said review is complete. It will be seen from the above that there is an overlap in the respective distributions of &quot;A. acuminata&quot;, &quot;A. komarovii&quot; and &quot;A. pallidiflora&quot; in the lush Hyrcanian forests of Northern Iran, and it is possible that some or all of these species may yet be subsumed in the concept &quot;Atropa belladonna&quot;. &quot;A. belladonna&quot; itself (including its variety &quot;caucasica&quot;) is also present in the Hyrcanian forests and vol. 100 of Flora Iranica includes a useful key with which to distinguish the four species occurring in northern Iran. Data on &quot;A. pallidiflora&quot; and &quot;A. acuminata&quot; Royle ex Miers are neither abundant nor readily accessible on the Internet at present. The reported presence of an &quot;Atropa&quot; species in Mongolia is intriguing, given that country&#x27;s relative remoteness from Kashmir and its (Kashmir&#x27;s) well-attested population of &quot;Atropa acuminata&quot; Royle ex Lindl. The unequivocal presence of &quot;Atropa&quot; in the Eastern Himalaya would go at least some way to bridging the gap between Kashmiri and Mongolian populations of this genus. Some light has been cast upon this problem by the gaining better knowledge of the rare and poorly-known species &quot;A. indobelladonna&quot;, found in Arunachal Pradesh and adjoining areas of Assam. It was named in 1965 and originally placed in the monotypic genus &quot;Pauia&quot; as &quot;Pauia belladonna&quot;, and authors Deb and Dutta described it as bearing a marked similarity to &quot;Atropa acuminata&quot; . It was placed in genus &quot;Atropa&quot; in 2020.

<doc id="204595" wikidata="Q2410463" url="?curid=204595" title="USS Idaho (BB-42)">
<text>USS &quot;Idaho&quot; (BB-42), a , was the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be named for the 43rd state. She was the third of three ships of her class. Built by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey, she was launched in June 1917 and commissioned in March 1919. She was armed with a battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, and was protected by heavy armor plate, with her main belt armor being thick.

&quot;Idaho&quot; spent most of the 1920s and 1930s in the Pacific Fleet, where she conducted routine training exercises. Like her sister ships, she was modernized in the early 1930s. In mid-1941, before the United States entered World War II, &quot;Idaho&quot; and her sisters were sent to join the Neutrality Patrols that protected American shipping during the Battle of the Atlantic. After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, &quot;Idaho&quot; and her sisters were sent to the Pacific, where she supported amphibious operations in the Pacific. She shelled Japanese forces during the Gilbert and Marshall Islands and the Philippines campaigns and the invasions of Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa.

&quot;Idaho&quot; was among the ships present in Tokyo Bay when Japan formally surrendered on 2 September 1945. With the war over, the ship was decommissioned in July 1946. She was sold to ship breakers in November 1947 and subsequently dismantled.

==Design==
&quot;Idaho&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full combat load. The ship was powered by four-shaft Curtis turbines and nine oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers rated at , generating a top speed of . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her crew numbered 1,081 officers and enlisted men. As built, she was fitted with two lattice masts with spotting tops for the main gun battery. The main armored belt was thick, while the main armored deck was up to thick. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces on barbettes. The conning tower had thick sides.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve /50 caliber guns in four, three-gun turrets on the centerline, placed in two superfiring pairs forward and aft of the superstructure. Unlike earlier American battleships with triple turrets, these mounts allowed each barrel to elevate independently. The secondary battery consisted of fourteen /51 caliber guns mounted in individual casemates clustered in the superstructure amidships. Initially, the ship was to have been fitted with twenty-two of the guns, but experiences in the North Sea during World War I demonstrated that the additional guns, which would have been placed in the hull, would have been unusable in anything but calm seas. As a result, the casemates were plated over to prevent flooding. The secondary battery was augmented with four /50 caliber guns. In addition to her gun armament, &quot;Idaho&quot; was also fitted with two torpedo tubes, mounted submerged in the hull, one on each broadside.

===Modifications===

Starting in 1921, the Navy began installing aircraft catapults on its battleships, and &quot;Idaho&quot; was among the vessels to receive a Mark II catapult. &quot;Idaho&quot; was heavily modernized in the early 1930s. Her original turbines were replaced with new geared models manufactured by Westinghouse, and she received six express boilers designed by the Bureau of Engineering. This improved her performance to a top speed of from . Her armament was also revised, with the main battery turrets being modified to allow elevation to 30 degrees, greatly extending the range of the guns. Two of the 5-inch guns were removed, and eight 5-inch/25 caliber anti-aircraft guns were installed. She received an additional armored deck, and her underwater protection was improved. Both lattice masts were removed; a heavy tower bridge was built in place of the fore mast, and a light pole mast was erected in place of the main mast. During the installation of the new bridge, she was fitted out as a flagship, which included the addition of a flag bridge for the admiral and his staff. These alterations greatly increased her displacement, to standard and full load. Her crew increased significantly, to 1,443.

During a refit from 14 October to 28 December 1942, &quot;Idaho&quot; received a new anti-aircraft battery of ten quadruple Bofors guns and forty-three Oerlikon guns, though the Oerlikons were added in stages. By the time the refit ended, she carried only sixteen of them, with eleven more added in January 1943, the remaining sixteen being added in February. From 22 October 1944 to 1 January 1945, &quot;Idaho&quot; received another major refit, which included the installation of ten 5-inch/38 caliber guns in individual, dual-purpose mounts in place of the old 25-caliber guns. She also received new Mark 8 radars for her main battery fire control system.

==Service history==
=== Interwar period ===
&quot;Idaho&quot; was laid down on 20 January 1915 at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation in Camden, New Jersey. She was launched on 30 June 1917, and after fitting-out work ended, the new battleship was commissioned into the fleet on 24 March 1919. Shortly afterward, the ship began her shakedown cruise, departing on 13 April for Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, before returning to New York. There, the President of Brazil, Epitácio Pessoa, boarded the ship to return to Brazil. The trip began on 6 July; &quot;Idaho&quot; reached Rio de Janeiro on 17 July, where Pessoa left the ship, and continued on to the Panama Canal. She steamed to Monterey, California, where she joined the Pacific Fleet in September. The fleet then conducted a series of training exercises and held a naval review on 13 September for President Woodrow Wilson. &quot;Idaho&quot; hosted the Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels and the Secretary of the Interior John B. Payne for a tour of Alaska, which concluded on 22 July.

&quot;Idaho&quot; returned to the peacetime routine of fleet exercises over the next five years; these were held off the coast of North and South America, as far south as Chile. The ship was also present for a variety of ceremonies during this period, including a Naval Review for President Warren Harding in Seattle in 1923. The Pacific Fleet was reorganized as the Battle Fleet in 1922. She took part in major exercises off Hawaii in 1925, departing California on 15 April. The exercises lasted until 1 July, after which &quot;Idaho&quot; embarked on a cruise to the southern Pacific. Stops included Samoa, Australia, and New Zealand. While returning from Hawaii to California, she carried Commander John Rodgers, who had failed in his attempt to fly a seaplane from California to Hawaii. The ship reached San Francisco on 24 September. For the next six years, &quot;Idaho&quot; was based in San Pedro, where she continued to conduct readiness training, alternating between the Pacific and the Caribbean Sea.

On 7 September 1931, she departed San Pedro for the Norfolk Navy Yard, where she received a major reconstruction that began after her arrival on 30 September. The lengthy reconstruction finished on 9 October 1934, and after completing another shakedown cruise in the Caribbean, &quot;Idaho&quot; returned to San Pedro, arriving on 17 April 1935. Fleet maneuvers increased in frequency, particularly after tensions began to rise with Japan over its expansionist policies in Asia. In mid-1940, the Battle Fleet was transferred from California to Hawaii; &quot;Idaho&quot; joined the other ships on 1 July. By this time, World War II had broken out in Europe, spawning the Battle of the Atlantic. In response, President Franklin D. Roosevelt initiated the Neutrality Patrols to protect American shipping. On 7 May 1941, Admiral Harold Stark, the Chief of Naval Operations, transferred &quot;Idaho&quot;, her sisters and , the aircraft carrier , four light cruisers, and two destroyer squadrons to the Atlantic to reinforce the Neutrality Patrols. &quot;Idaho&quot; left Hawaii on 6 June, bound for Hampton Roads to join the neutrality patrols. In September, she was stationed in Hvalfjörður, Iceland, and was there when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December.

=== World War II ===
With the United States now an active participant in World War II, &quot;Idaho&quot; and &quot;Mississippi&quot; left Iceland on 9 December to rejoin the Pacific Fleet. They stopped in Norfolk before steaming through the Panama Canal and continuing on to San Francisco, where they arrived on 31 January 1942. For much of the year, &quot;Idaho&quot; was occupied with combat training off the coast of California. In October, she went to the Puget Sound Navy Yard to receive replacements for her worn out main battery guns. The original secondary battery of 5-inch/51 cal. guns was removed as these guns were badly needed to arm merchant ships. Further training followed until April 1943, when on the 7th she departed for the Aleutian Islands, where Japanese troops had occupied the islands of Attu and Kiska. &quot;Idaho&quot; served as the flagship of the bombardment and patrol force. On 11 May, US Army forces went ashore on Attu, and &quot;Idaho&quot; provided gunfire support for the assault. The following month, a second attack followed on Kiska, but the Japanese had already abandoned the island in July. On 7 September, &quot;Idaho&quot; returned to San Francisco to begin preparations for the next major amphibious assault, which shifted focus to the central Pacific.

&quot;Idaho&quot; moved to Pearl Harbor and then joined the invasion fleet on 10 November, which then steamed to the Gilbert Islands. They arrived off Makin Atoll on 20 November; &quot;Idaho&quot; continued her role as gunfire support for the next two weeks, shelling Japanese positions in the Gilberts as well as contributing her antiaircraft battery to defend against Japanese aerial attacks. On 5 December, she left the area for Pearl Harbor, where she prepared for the next attack, against the Marshall Islands. On 31 January 1944, &quot;Idaho&quot; and the rest of the fleet arrived off Kwajalein to begin the preparatory bombardment. She continued to batter Japanese forces until 5 February, by which time the Marines had wrested control of the small island from its Japanese garrison. &quot;Idaho&quot; replenished fuel and ammunition at Majuro before returning to shell Japanese positions on other islands in the Marshalls before steaming to Kavieng, New Ireland to conduct a diversionary bombardment on 20 March.

On 25 March, &quot;Idaho&quot; arrived in the New Hebrides, before continuing on to Australia for a brief stay. She returned to Kwajalein on 8 June, where she joined a group of escort carriers for the invasion of the Mariana Islands. &quot;Idaho&quot; began the preparatory bombardment of Saipan on 14 June, with the assault taking place the following day. &quot;Idaho&quot; then shifted to Guam, where she shelled Japanese positions. During the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19–20 June, &quot;Idaho&quot; remained with the invasion fleet and protected the troop transports and supply ships. She steamed to Eniwetok in the Marshalls to replenish her stocks of ammunition from 28 June to 9 July, before returning to Guam on 12 July. She bombarded the island for eight days before ground troops went ashore on 21 July. The ship continued to support American forces ashore until 2 August, when she returned to Eniwetok for further supplies. From there, she steamed to Espiritu Santo, where on 15 August she entered a floating dry dock for repairs.

In early September, &quot;Idaho&quot; steamed to Guadalcanal, where she took part in amphibious assault training. On 12 September, she steamed to Peleliu and joined the preparatory bombardment of the island. In the ensuing Battle of Peleliu, dug in Japanese defenders inflicted heavy casualties on the assaulting Marines, with &quot;Idaho&quot; providing artillery support until 24 September, when she withdrew for an overhaul. She steamed to Manus and then to Bremerton, Washington, arriving on 22 October. During the refit, the 5-inch /25 cal. guns were replaced by ten 5-inch /38 cal. guns in single enclosed mounts; she was the only ship of her class to receive this modification. The installation of these guns required the removal of the last of the old 5-inch /51 guns, as the new weapons required continuous ammunition hoists. After completion of the work, she conducted training off California. On 28 January 1945, &quot;Idaho&quot; departed San Diego, bound for Pearl Harbor. There, she joined the bombardment group, which proceeded to the Marianas and then on 14 February steamed north to Iwo Jima, the target of the next major amphibious assault. The ship bombarded the Japanese defenders on 19 February as the Marines went ashore; &quot;Idaho&quot; remained there for nearly a month before withdrawing on 7 March to replenish at Ulithi.

On 21 March, &quot;Idaho&quot; joined Task Force 54 (TF 54), the Gunfire and Covering Group under the command of Rear Admiral Morton Deyo, as the flagship of Bombardment Unit 4 for the invasion of Okinawa. She began shelling Okinawa on 25 March, and the landings started on 1 April. The battle marked the height of the &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks by the increasingly desperate Japanese defenders. &quot;Idaho&quot; shot down five kamikazes in a massed attack on 12 April, and in return, a near miss inflicted damage to her port side anti-torpedo bulge. Temporary repairs were effected off Okinawa, and on 20 April she left for Guam, arriving on the 25th. Permanent repairs were completed quickly, allowing the ship to return to Okinawa on 22 May, where she resumed her fire support mission. She operated off Okinawa until 20 June, before departing for the Philippines. There, she conducted training operations in Leyte Gulf until Japan agreed to surrender on 15 August. &quot;Idaho&quot; was among the ships to enter Tokyo Bay on 27 August, carrying a detachment of occupation troops. She was present during the signing of the surrender documents on 2 September. The ship left Japanese waters on 6 September, bound for the east coast of the United States. She arrived in Norfolk on 16 October, and was decommissioned there on 3 July 1946. She remained in reserve for a year and a half before being sold for scrap on 24 November 1947 to Lipsett, Inc., of New York City.

<text> (; literally &#x27;The Post&#x27;) is the state-owned provider of postal services in Ireland. An Post provides a &quot;universal postal service&quot; to all parts of the country as a member of the Universal Postal Union. Services provided include letter post, parcel service, deposit accounts, Express Post (an all-Ireland next-day delivery service), and EMS (international express-mail service).

==Background==


An Post, the Irish postal service, came into being in 1984 when, under the terms of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983, the Post Office services of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (P&amp;T) were divided between An Post and Telecom Éireann, the telecommunications operator (rebranded as Eircom after privatisation in 1999 and in 2015 as Eir). At its inception, during the early years of the Irish Free State, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was the country&#x27;s largest department of state, and its employees (most of them postmen) constituted the largest sector of the civil service.

Prior to this, the Post Office in Ireland had been under the control of various Postmasters General, Irish and British, with the appointment of Evan Vaughan as postmaster in Dublin in 1638, generally accepted as the date for the establishment of a semi-formal postal system in Ireland. Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Postal Act of 1657 created a combined General Post Office for the three kingdoms of Ireland, Scotland, and England; the position was affirmed by Charles II and his parliament by the Post Office Act 1660.

, An Post remains one of Ireland&#x27;s largest employers but it has undergone considerable downsizing. In 2020, Munster&#x27;s only sorting centre in Little Island, Cork closed. The closure of individual branches in rural areas has become a significant political issue. In 2014, all parts of An Post made a profit for the first time in eight years. As of 2018 there were approximately 1,100 An Post offices and over 100 postal agents across Ireland.

The Irish government announced the introduction of a postcode system, Eircode, in Ireland from 2008 though An Post was against the system at the time, saying it was unnecessary. The introduction of Eircodes took place on 13 July 2015, after almost a decade of delays.

All parcels arriving in Ireland pass through An Post&#x27;s mail centre in Portlaoise, where customs officials are on duty to inspect them.

An Post adopted its current logo on 14 December 2018; it did not make its first appearance until 13 March 2019. On branded signage, individual post offices are labelled or (in English) &#x27;Post Office&#x27;.

On 22 June 2023, An Post moved from its historic headquarters in the General Post Office building on O&#x27;Connell Street in Dublin to new premises at North Wall Quay.

==Subsidiaries and joint ventures==
An Post is involved in a number of joint venture operations and also has several subsidiaries. It has complete ownership of some of these, while it is part-owner of others, such as the An Post National Lottery Company and the Prize Bond Company Limited.

===An Post National Lottery Company===
An Post held the licence granted by the Minister for Finance to run the National Lottery through its subsidiary, An Post National Lottery Company until February 2014. All employees of An Post National Lottery Company were seconded from An Post, and as such were employed and paid by An Post rather than by the subsidiary. Since 2014, the National Lottery has been operated by Premier Lotteries Ireland, in which An Post is a stakeholder.

===An Post Transaction Services===
In 2003, An Post set up a new division to run its post office and transaction services business, entitled An Post Transaction Services or PostTS. It rebranded its post offices network as &quot;Post Office&quot; or &quot;Oifig an Phoist&quot; with a new, white-and-red logo, and introduced banking services in conjunction with Allied Irish Banks. This followed the introduction of a service whereby newsagents could provide some Post Office services. This service, entitled PostPoint and operated as subsidiary of An Post, was originally formed in 2000 to sell mobile phone top-ups over-the-counter to Eircell subscribers.

In 2005 PostTS sold its foreign operations, and the rebranding effort largely reversed, with the traditional An Post logo restored to Post Offices. Between 2005 and 2006, An Post sold its interest in the Post TS UK and An Post Transaction Services businesses to Alphyra, for a reported €59.3m.

===Geodirectory===
Jointly established by An Post and Ordnance Survey Ireland, Geodirectory is a service that provides a database of buildings and addresses in Ireland, as well as their geolocation details. It holds records for 2.2 million properties that receive post. GeoDirectory assigns each property its own individual &quot;fingerprint&quot; – a unique, verified address in a standardised format, together with a geocode which identifies every property in the country. Geodirectory also operates a mobile app called GeoFindIT.

===Postbank===
On 5 October 2006 An Post signed an agreement for the creation of a joint venture with Fortis to provide financial services through the Post Office network. This joint venture with BNP Paribas was created to offer financial products and services to the Irish market, including daily banking, savings products, insurance, mortgages, and credit cards. PostPoint and the company&#x27;s insurance business, One Direct, was to become part of the new company, with access to the Post Office network. In April 2007 a press launch was held for the new bank, which is to be known as Postbank (legally &quot;Postbank Ireland Limited&quot;, to distinguish from other similarly named operations such as Deutsche Postbank). By February 2010, the closure of the Postbank unit had been announced, and the operation was wound down by the end of December 2010.

Some counter business for AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank can also be conducted at post offices.

===Postbus===
Between 1984 and 2004 the company operated a postbus route linking Ennis with parts of County Clare.

===Television licensing===
Television licensing is administered by An Post. It is responsible for the collection of revenue, inspection, and prosecution in cases of non-payment of the licence on behalf of the state.

=== An Post Mobile ===
An Post runs a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) using Vodafone&#x27;s Irish network.

=== AddressPal ===
In 2017, An Post launched AddressPal, a package forwarding service, operating through its subsidiary Air Business in St Albans, Hertfordshire, England. The service allows customers to shop from the UK and USA using a proxy address allowing items to be delivered to their home address in Ireland. 

In October 2018, Air Business relocated to Hatfield Business Park in nearby Hatfield.

==Developments==

In 2009, An Post sponsored a postcard project, called &quot;C Both Sides&quot;, which ran for a year, with the public being invited to create postcards on different themes.

In February 2012, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) launched legal proceedings against An Post over the quality of its service. An Post said it was &quot;puzzled&quot; by the decision.

In August 2018, it was announced that all post offices serving communities of fewer than 500 people (excluding offshore islands) were to be closed. However, three of these 159 branches were &quot;spared&quot; closure following local campaigns at Ballinskelligs (Kerry), Cliffoney (Sligo), and Ballycroy (Mayo).

<text>Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold is a 1956 novel by C. S. Lewis. It is a retelling of Cupid and Psyche, based on its telling in a chapter of &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; of Apuleius. This story had haunted Lewis all his life, because he believed that some of the main characters&#x27; actions were illogical. As a consequence, his retelling of the story is characterized by a highly developed character, the narrator, with the reader being drawn into her reasoning and her emotions. This was his last novel, and he considered it his most mature, written in conjunction with his wife, Joy Davidman.

The first part of the book is written from the perspective of Psyche&#x27;s older sister Orual, as an accusation against the gods. The story is set in the kingdom of Glome, a primitive city-state whose people have occasional contact with civilized Hellenistic Greece. In the second part of the book, the narrator undergoes a change of mindset (Lewis would use the term &quot;conversion&quot;) and understands that her initial accusation was tainted by her own failings and shortcomings, and that the gods are lovingly present in humans&#x27; lives.

== Plot summary ==
===Part One===
The story tells the ancient Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche, from the perspective of Orual, Psyche&#x27;s older sister.

It begins as the complaint of Orual as an old woman, who is bitter at the injustice of the gods. She has always been ugly, but after her mother dies and her father the King of Glome remarries, she gains a beautiful half-sister Istra, whom she loves as her own daughter, and who is known throughout the novel by the Greek version of her name, Psyche. Psyche is so beautiful that the people of Glome begin to offer sacrifices to her as to a goddess. The Priest of the goddess Ungit, a powerful figure in the kingdom, then informs the king that various plagues befalling the kingdom are a result of Ungit&#x27;s jealousy, so Psyche is sent as a human sacrifice to the unseen &quot;God of the Mountain&quot; at the command of Ungit, the mountain-god&#x27;s mother. Orual plans to rescue Psyche but falls ill and is unable to prevent anything.

When she is well again, Orual arranges to go to where Psyche was stranded on the mountain, either to rescue her or to bury what remains of her. She is stunned to find Psyche is alive, free from the shackles in which she had been bound, and furthermore says she does not need to be rescued in any way. Rather, Psyche relates that she lives in a beautiful castle that Orual cannot see, as the God of the Mountain has made her a bride rather than a victim. At one point in the narrative, Orual believes she has a brief vision of this castle, but then it vanishes like a mist. Hearing that Psyche has been commanded by her new god-husband not to look on his face (all their meetings are in the nighttime), Orual is immediately suspicious. She argues that the god must be a monster, or that Psyche has actually started to hallucinate after her abandonment and near-death on the mountain, that there is no such castle at all, and that her husband is actually an outlaw who was hiding on the mountain and takes advantage of her delusions in order to have his way with her. Orual says that because either possibility is one that she cannot abide by, she must disabuse her sister of this illusion.

She returns a second time, bringing Psyche a lamp for her to use while her &quot;husband&quot; sleeps, and when Psyche insists that she will not betray her husband by disobeying his command, Orual threatens both Psyche and herself, stabbing herself in the arm to show she is capable of following through on her threat. Ultimately, reluctantly, Psyche agrees because of the coercion and her love for her sister.

When Psyche disobeys her husband, she is immediately banished from her beautiful castle and forced to wander as an exile. The God of the Mountain appears to Orual, stating that Psyche must now endure hardship at the hand of a force he himself could not fight (likely his mother the goddess Ungit), and that &quot;You too shall be Psyche,&quot; which Orual attempts to interpret for the rest of her life, usually taking it to mean that as Psyche suffers, she must suffer also. She decries the injustice of the gods, saying that if they had shown her a picture of Psyche&#x27;s happiness that was easier to believe, she would not have ruined it. From this day forward she vows that she will keep her face veiled at all times.

Eventually, Orual becomes a Queen, and a warrior, diplomat, architect, reformer, politician, legislator, and judge, though all the while remaining alone. She drives herself, through work, to forget her grief and the love she has lost. Psyche is gone, her other family she never cared for, and her beloved tutor, &quot;the Fox,&quot; has died. Her main love interest throughout the novel, Bardia, the captain of the royal guard, is married and forever faithful to his wife until his death. To her, the gods remain, as ever, silent, unseen, and merciless.

While Bardia is on his deathbed, Orual decides she can no longer stand the sight of her own kingdom and decides to leave it for the first time to visit neighboring kingdoms. While resting on her journey, she leaves her group at their camp and follows sounds from within a wood, which turn out to be coming from a temple to the goddess Istra (Psyche). There Orual hears a version of Psyche&#x27;s myth, which shows her as deliberately ruining her sister&#x27;s life out of envy. In response, she writes out her own story, as set forth in the book, to set the record straight. Her hope is that it will be brought to Greece, where she has heard that men are willing to question even the gods.

===Part Two===
Orual begins the second part of the book stating that her previous accusation that the gods are unjust is wrong. She does not have time to rewrite the whole book because she is very old and of ill health and will likely die before it can be redone, so instead she is adding on to the end.

She relates that since finishing part one of the book, she has experienced a number of dreams and visions, which at first she doubts the truth of except that they also start happening during daytime when she is fully awake. She sees herself being required to perform a number of impossible tasks, like sorting a giant mound of different seeds into separate piles, with no allowance for error, or collecting the golden wool from a flock of murderous rams, or fetching a bowl of water from a spring on a mountain which cannot be climbed and furthermore is covered with poisonous beasts. It is in the midst of this last vision that she is led to a huge chamber in the land of the dead and given the opportunity to read out her complaint in the gods&#x27; hearing. She discovers, however, that instead of reading the book she has written, she reads off a paper that appears in her hand and contains her true feelings, which are indeed much less noble than Part One of the book would suggest. Orual thinks she has been speaking only a short time, but then when stopped, realizes she has been pouring out the story of all her inner conflict and turmoil for days, repeating herself over and over and over again, as the gods sat silently. Still, rather than being jealous of Psyche, as the story she heard in the temple suggested, she reveals that she was jealous of the gods because they were allowed to enjoy Psyche&#x27;s love while she herself was not.

The gods make no reply. But Orual is content, as she sees that the gods&#x27; &quot;answer&quot; was really to hold up the mirror of her lies to herself, and make her understand the truth of her own life and actions. Then she is led by the ghost of the Fox into a sunlit arena in which she learns the story of what Psyche has been doing: she has herself been assigned the impossible tasks from Orual&#x27;s dreams, but was able to complete them with supernatural help. Orual then leaves the arena to enter another verdant field with a clear pool of water and a brilliant sky. There she meets Psyche, who has just returned from her last errand: retrieving a box of beauty from the underworld, which she then gives to Orual, though Orual is hardly conscious of this because at that moment she begins to sense that something else is happening. The God of the Mountain is coming to be with Psyche and judge Orual, but the only thing he says is &quot;You also are Psyche&quot; before the vision ends. The reader is led to understand that this phrase has actually been one of mercy the entire time.

Orual, awoken from the vision, dies shortly thereafter but has just enough time to record her visions and to write that she no longer hates the gods but sees that their very presence, though mysterious, is the answer she always needed.

== Conception ==
The idea of retelling the myth of Cupid and Psyche, with the palace invisible, had been in Lewis&#x27;s mind ever since he was an undergraduate; the retelling, as he imagined it, involved writing through the perspective of the elder sister. He argued that this made the sister not simply envious and spiteful, but ignorant (as any mortal might be of the divine) and jealous (as anyone could be in their love). He tried it in different verse-forms when he considered himself primarily a poet, so that one could say that he&#x27;d been &quot;at work on Orual for 35 years&quot;, even though the version told in the book &quot;was very quickly written&quot;. In his pre-Christian days, Lewis would imagine the story with Orual &quot;in the right and the gods in the wrong&quot;.

One of the inconsistencies of Apuleius&#x27;s version was the fact that the sisters could see the palace. For Lewis, the theme of belief is central to the story and he felt that Apuleius missed the chance to give his version of the story a true mythic quality; that is to invoke what &quot;Rudolph Otto&quot; terms in his 1923 work &quot;The Idea of the Holy&quot; the idea of the &quot;numinous&quot; which is a feeling of awe in the presence of the spiritual or holy, the supernatural. Orual does not posses the belief system that will allow her to enter into the realm of the numinous as she briefly catches sight of the palace before it vanishes. After this scene, her resolve to &quot;protect&quot; Psyche from the love of others is the root of her jealousy and the crux of her accusation against the injustices of the gods. Conversely, Psyche, from an early age, exhibits the openness to embrace the numinous; she feels a civic duty to heal the citizenry of Glome, she willingly accepts her role as the Accursed and the conjoined penalty of death/marriage to the Shadowbrute, the god of the Grey Mountain.

Another theme that Lewis felt Apuleius did not fully develop revolves around &quot;sacrifice&quot;. &quot;Till We Have Faces&quot; is a retelling of Apuleius&#x27;s original story. Within Lewis&#x27;s work there is also a retelling of the myth Orual has been telling her self represented by the segmenting of her narrative into Part 1 (the myth she tells (of) herself) and Part 2 (the retelling (to/of) herself with a new understanding of her self-awareness and outer connections to others). By the end of Part 1, Orual realizes that her love for Psyche has become perverted; it is a possessive love, unwilling to share Psyche&#x27;s love with others. Bardia&#x27;s widow, Ansit, points this out to Orual in a no-holds-barred confrontation after her husband&#x27;s death; Orual has &quot;consumed&quot; the lives of her loved ones just as Ungit consumes sacrifices. This begins the dose of self-awareness that leads to Orual&#x27;s &quot;death of self&quot; or sacrifice of her self to others, a higher, more universal power. On a societal or cultural level, the need to temper the natural loves, what Lewis would expand upon four years after &quot;TWHF&quot; in his 1960 book &quot;The Four Loves,&quot; with the subjugation of &quot;storge&quot; (affection), &quot;philia&quot; (friendship), and &quot;eros&quot; (romantic love) to that of &quot;agape&quot; (divine love) is the basis for one&#x27;s ability to retain the ordered nature of those three natural loves; without the authority of agape, divine love, to govern them, the breakdown of the natural loves would ensue as a result of the back-biting nature of the three natural loves if left to their own devices. This ideology goes as far back as Homer&#x27;s era and the subject of the Trojan War which was used to exemplify to Greeks the effects of disordered love on socio-cultural mores (see &quot;Helen of Troy&quot;).

=== Origin of title ===
Lewis originally titled his working manuscripts &quot;Bareface&quot;. The editor (Gibb) rejected the title &quot;Bareface&quot; on the ground that readers would mistake it for a Western. In response, Lewis said he failed to see why people would be deterred from buying the book if they thought it was a Western, and that the working title was cryptic enough to be intriguing. Nevertheless, Lewis started considering an alternative title on February 29, 1956, and chose &quot;Till We Have Faces&quot;, which refers to a line from the book where Orual says, &quot;How can [the gods] meet us face to face till we have faces?&quot; He defended his choice in a letter to his long-time correspondent, Dorothea Conybeare, explaining the idea that a human &quot;must be speaking with its own voice (not one of its borrowed voices), expressing its actual desires (not what it imagines that it desires), being for good or ill itself, not any mask, veil, or persona.&quot;

== Myth and setting ==
Myths, like fairy tales, are typically set in an enigmatic location with a nebulous orientation toward time. This draws the attention of the audience to the actions of the characters which signify the importance of the choices the characters make; it forces the focus on the moralizing aspects of the characters rather than on their surroundings and it relies on archetypes to convey the anticipated actions. Lewis does something different in his approach to his retelling of the Cupid and Psyche myth from Apuleius. He makes the fictitious setting of &quot;TWHF&quot; as real, as believable, as historic as possible in order to establish the historicity of his version. He painstakingly describes the geography of the region surrounding Glome and even goes so far as to have Orual speak in terms of how far places were distanced by would-be units of measure; &quot;[Glome] is built about as far back from the river as a woman can walk in the third of an hour...&quot;, for example.

This grounding of the story in the &quot;historically concrete&quot; establishes the validity to the historicity of the story which is precisely what Lewis&#x27;s intentions were: to make the argument that myths are the embodiment of or basis for historical figures and their actions evolving culturally to epic proportions. He was well aware of the concept of &quot;euhemerism&quot; which the more sophisticated Greeks had developed to explain epistemologically their pantheon. Championed by &quot;Euhemerus&quot; and promulgated circa 300 B.C.E., this embryonic conception posits the notion that many of the gods were historical mortal personalities who became deified. Lewis wrote to Clyde Kilby that &quot;TWHF&quot; is &quot;&#x27;A work of (supposed) historical imagination. A guess at what it might have been like in a little barbarous state on the borders of the Hellenistic world with Greek culture just beginning to affect it&#x27;&quot;. Doris T. Myers makes the case that it is a synthesis of both historical fiction and modern fiction, thus giving credence to the day-in-the-lifeness historicity and its intermingling with &quot;Jungian&quot; psychological archetypes of the narrative to the work.

== Reception ==
Lewis called &quot;Till We Have Faces&quot; &quot;far and away my best book&quot;. This opinion was echoed by J. R. R. Tolkien. Robert Gorham Davis in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Lewis &quot;still does not have all the equipment of a major novelist&quot; but deemed it &quot;much more convincing&quot; than his religious novels. He praised it for being &quot;firmly grounded in actual primitive religious practice&quot; and wrote that the novel&#x27;s &quot;imaginative unity ... exerts ... [a] combination of awfulness, wonder and attraction&quot;.

<text>Events from the year 1868 in literature.

==Events==
*January – Émile Zola defends his first major novel, &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; (1867), against charges of pornography and corruption of morals. 
*January 4–August 8 – Wilkie Collins&#x27; epistolary novel &quot;The Moonstone: a Romance&quot; is serialised in &quot;All the Year Round&quot; (U.K.), being published in book format in July by Tinsley Brothers of London. It is seen as a precursor of full-length mystery fiction (with its introduction of the police detective Sergeant Cuff) and the psychological thriller.
*January 9 – John William De Forest, writing for &quot;The Nation&quot;, calls for a more specifically American literature; the essay&#x27;s title, &quot;The Great American Novel&quot;, is the first known use of the term.
*April 29 – The Court of King&#x27;s Bench (England) decides on appeal the legal case &quot;Regina v. Hicklin&quot; on interpretation of the word &quot;obscene&quot; in the Obscene Publications Act 1857, applying the &quot;Hicklin test&quot;: that any part of a publication with a &quot;tendency... to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall&quot; makes the whole publication obscene, regardless of the author&#x27;s intentions.
*September – The first volume of Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s novel for girls &quot;Little Women&quot; is published by Roberts Brothers of Boston, Massachusetts.
*November
**Robert Browning&#x27;s narrative poem &quot;The Ring and the Book&quot; begins four-part publication by Smith, Elder &amp; Co. in London. It is a major commercial and critical success.
**Norman MacLeod, editor of &quot;Good Words&quot; (U.K.), begins publishing its companion juvenile version, &quot;Good Words for the Young&quot;. The first issue begins the serial publication of George MacDonald&#x27;s &quot;At the Back of the North Wind&quot;.
*December – The Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street) in London opens with the première of the recently bankrupted Henry James Byron&#x27;s semi-autobiographical comedy &quot;Cyril&#x27;s Success&quot;.
*&quot;unknown dates&quot;
**The first edition of &quot;The World Almanac and Book of Facts&quot; is published by the &quot;New York World&quot;.
**The first substantial translation into English from &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; is made by Edward Charles Bowra.
**Tauchnitz publishers of Leipzig begin their &quot;Collection of German Authors&quot;, a series of cheap, authorized paperback reprints.

<text>The Lockheed EP-3 is an electronic signals reconnaissance variant of the P-3 Orion, primarily operated by the United States Navy.

== Development ==
A total of 12 P-3C aircraft were converted to replace older versions of the aircraft, which had been converted in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The aircraft is known by the acronym ARIES, or &quot;Airborne Reconnaissance Integrated Electronic System&quot;. and has Signals intelligence (SIGINT) capabilities. SIGINT is the interception of signals, whether communications between people (communications intelligence—abbreviated to COMINT) or from electronic signals not directly used in communication (electronic intelligence—abbreviated to ELINT). The EP-3E generally has a crew of 24, including linguists, cryptographers and technicians.

The squadrons that flew the EP-3E also flew the Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star from 1962 to 1974 and the Douglas EA-3B Skywarrior from 1960 to 1991. There are 11 EP-3Es in the Navy&#x27;s inventory, the last of which was delivered in 1997.

==Hainan Island incident==
On 1 April 2001, an aerial collision between a United States Navy EP-3E ARIES II, a signals reconnaissance version and a People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy Shenyang J-8II fighter resulted in an international incident between the United States and China. Operating about 70 miles (110 km) away from the PRC island province of Hainan Island, the EP-3 was intercepted by two J-8II fighters. One of the J-8IIs collided with it. The J-8II crashed into the sea and the pilot, Lt. Cdr. Wang, was seen to eject after the collision. His body was never recovered and he was declared dead. The EP-3 came close to becoming uncontrollable, at one point sustaining a nearly inverted roll, but was able to make a successful, unauthorized emergency landing at Lingshui airfield on Hainan island, where the two J-8II fighters involved in the incident had been based. At least 15 distress signals from the Orion had gone unanswered. The crew and the plane were subsequently detained by Chinese authorities because of the death of the Chinese pilot.

After several days of interrogations, the crew was repatriated separately to the United States while the aircraft remained in China, reportedly taken apart for research on American intelligence technology. Although the crew attempted to destroy as much classified material, hardware, and software on the aircraft as possible prior to the emergency landing, there is little doubt that the EP-3 was exploited by Chinese intelligence services. An American team was later permitted to enter Hainan in order to dismantle the aircraft, which was subsequently airlifted on board two of Polet Flight&#x27;s Antonov An-124s back to the United States for reassembly and repair.

This incident is fictionally portrayed in the TV Series JAG: Season 7, Episode 9 https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0613245/?ref_=ttep_ep9

== Other incidents ==
On 29 January 2018, a near accident was reported on the Black Sea, when a Russian Su-27 passed a U.S. EP-3 at a distance of several feet.

In a separate incident, on 5 November 2018, a U.S. EP-3 was again claimed to have been closely passed in international airspace by a Russian Su-27.

On 19 July 2019, a U.S. EP-3 was &quot;performing a multi-nationally recognized and approved mission in international airspace&quot; over the Caribbean Sea, when a Venezuelan Su-30 aggressively shadowed it at an unsafe distance. 

==Fictional incidents==
==EP-X==
Boeing has started working on an unscheduled replacement aircraft, the EP-X, based on their 737.

On 16 August 2009, The Navy issued an &quot;EP-X Analysis of Alternatives&quot; that called for &quot;information useful for the execution of the Electronic Patrol-X (EP-X) program which will recapitalize the EP-3E aircraft to provide tactical, theater, and national level Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting (ISR&amp;T) support to Carrier Strike Groups and to Theater, Combatant, and National Commanders.&quot;

On 23 September 2009, leaked Navy budget documents for FY2011 revealed that the EP-X program would be delayed rather than started in that year.

On 1 February 2010, President Obama unveiled his proposed budget for 2010. This budget called for, among other things, canceling the EP-X program.

==Replacement==
After the cancellation of the EP-X Program, the U.S. Navy has planned to replace the EP-3E Aries II with the Northrop Grumman MQ-4C Triton unmanned aircraft and the MQ-8B Fire Scout unmanned helicopter. All P-3 Orion aircraft assigned to special projects squadrons (VPU) and all EP-3E Aries II aircraft will be fully retired by February of 2025.

==Variants==

* EP-3A: Seven modified for electronic reconnaissance testing.
* EP-3B: Least known of all in the P-3 family. Three P-3As (BuNo 149669, BuNo 149673, and BuNo 149678) were obtained by the CIA from the U.S. Navy under Project STSPIN in May 1963, as the replacement aircraft for CIA&#x27;s own covert operation fleet of RB-69A/P2V-7Us. Converted by Aerosystems Division of LTV at Greenville, Texas, the three P-3As were simply known as &quot;black&quot; P-3As under Project Axial. Officially transferred from U.S. Navy to CIA in June/July 1964. LTV Aerosystems converted the three aircraft to be both ELINT and COMINT platforms. The first of the three &quot;black&quot; P-3As arrived in Taiwan and were officially transferred to ROCAF&#x27;s top secret &quot;Black Bat&quot; Squadron on 22 June 1966. Armed with 4 Sidewinder short range AAM missiles for self-defense, the three &quot;black&quot; P-3As flew peripheral missions along the China coast to collect SIGINT and air samples. When the project was terminated in January 1967, all three &quot;black&quot; P-3As were flown to NAS Alameda, California, for long term storage. Two of the three aircraft (BuNo 149669 and BuNo 149678) were converted into the only two EP-3Bs in existence by Lockheed at Burbank in September 1967, while the third aircraft (149673) was converted by Lockheed in 1969–1970 to serve as a development aircraft for various electronic programs. The two EP-3Bs, known as &quot;Bat Rack&quot;, owing to their period of service with Taiwan&#x27;s &quot;Black Bat&quot; Squadron, were issued to the U.S. Navy&#x27;s VQ-1 Squadron in 1969 and deployed to Da Nang, Vietnam. In the 1980s these two planes were based at the Naval Air Facility, Atsugi, Japan with the Atsugi VQ-1 detachment. Later, the two EP-3Bs were converted to EP-3E ARIES, along with 10 EP-3As. The 12 EP-3Es retired in 1990s, when replaced by 12 EP-3E ARIES II.
* EP-3: ELINT aircraft for the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force.
* EP-3E ARIES: 10 P-3As and two EP-3Bs were converted into ELINT aircraft.
* EP-3E ARIES II: 12 P-3Cs were converted into ELINT aircraft. Last delivered in 1997.
* EP-3J: Two Electronic Warfare aircraft that were extensively modified P-3B Orions that supported the Fleet Electronic Warfare Support Group (FEWSG) . The aircraft were used as simulated adversary Electronic Warfare platforms in Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 33 (VAQ-33), then transferred to Patrol Squadron 66 (VP-66) and finally transferred to Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron 11 (VQ-11).

<text>This article contains information about the literary events and publications of 1866.

==Events==
*January – Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s novel &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; («Преступлéние и наказáние», &quot;Prestupleniye i nakazaniye&quot;) is serialized through the year in the monthly literary magazine &quot;Russkiy Vestnik&quot; («Русскій Вѣстникъ», &quot;The Russian Messenger&quot;). His novella &quot;The Gambler&quot; («Игрок», &quot;Igrok&quot;) is dictated to his future wife to meet a publisher deadline of November 1.
*July – Anthony Trollope&#x27;s novel &quot;Nina Balatka: The Story of a Maiden of Prague&quot; is initially published anonymously (serialisation in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; July 1866–January 1867). Trollope is interested in discovering whether his books sell on their own merits or as a consequence of the author&#x27;s name and reputation.
*September 8 – London publisher Samuel Orchart Beeton is obliged by the financial panic of 1866 to settle all his debts by selling his property. He sells his titles and name to Ward Lock &amp; Co. 
*November – The American magazine for children &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; publishes its first issue.
*&quot;unknown dates&quot;
**Ludwig Anzengruber returns to Vienna after working as a travelling actor.
**Charles Baudelaire&#x27;s collection &quot;Les Épaves&quot; is published in Belgium, containing poems from &quot;Les Fleurs du mal&quot; (Paris, 1857) that were suppressed for outraging public morality.
**Luigi Capuana becomes a theatre critic for the Italian newspaper &quot;The Nation&quot;.
**Josip Jurčič has &quot;Deseti brat&quot; (&quot;The Tenth Brother&quot;) published, as the first full-length novel in Slovene.
**Nandshankar Mehta publishes &quot;Karana Ghelo&quot; (&quot;The Idiot King Karana&quot;), the first novel in Gujarati.
**Hesba Stretton&#x27;s children&#x27;s story &quot;Jessica&#x27;s First Prayer&quot; is serialized in &quot;Sunday at Home&quot; (U.K.) As a book, it sells one and half million copies.
**Algernon Charles Swinburne&#x27;s first collection &quot;Poems and Ballads&quot; causes a sensation on publication in London, especially the ones written in homage to Sappho and the sadomasochistic &quot;Dolores (Notre-Dame des Sept Douleurs)&quot;. Under threat of prosecution, his original publisher, Moxon and Co., transfers publication rights to the more liberal John Camden Hotten.

<text>The prime minister of Belgium (; ; ) or the premier of Belgium is the head of the federal government of Belgium, and the most powerful person in Belgian politics.

The first head of government in Belgian history was Henri van der Noot in 1790, during the short-lived republic of the United Belgian States.

Although Leaders of Government (French: ) had been appointed since the independence of the country, until 1918 the king of the Belgians often presided over the Council of Ministers, so the modern era of the &quot;Premiership&quot; started after World War I with Léon Delacroix. The political importance of the Crown has decreased over time, whereas the position of prime minister has gradually become more important.

Bart De Wever, the (former) leader of New-Flemish Alliance, was appointed as new prime minister on 3 February 2025. He is the first Flemish Nationalist to ever become Premier of Belgium. He succeeded Alexander De Croo.

== History ==
In 1790, the Sovereign Congress of the States of Belgium sat in Brussels and was composed of representatives from each of the eight provinces. Henri van der Noot served as President of the National Congress, retaining the title of Minister Plenipotentiary having previously held the title Minister Plenipotentiary of Brabant.

Since the independence of Belgium in 1830, governments have been designated with the name of the minister who formed the government as formateur, but that position did not have a specific status. Originally, from 1831 the king of the Belgians presided over the Council of Ministers, but when he was absent, the presidency was taken by the &quot;chef de cabinet&quot; (head of Cabinet), usually the oldest or most influential minister. This position gradually became more prominent, and the minister with this title then soon acquired the competency to present the king with the proposed allocation of the various ministerial departments among the ministers.

With the expansion of voting rights after World War I, more political parties started to win seats in parliament—especially the Belgian Socialist Party—and this made it impossible to achieve an absolute majority in parliament. Since then, coalition governments have been necessary, which has made the task of forming a government by the appointed formateur more difficult. Consequently, the formateur increasingly gained greater respect, and much prestige. Thus the formateur became prominent as a position of leadership. As the ministers of the government now represented various political parties, there was a need for someone to coordinate the proceedings of the various ministers. The prime minister was now asserted as the actual head of government, and this is how the office of prime minister came into existence.

Gradually, the head of Cabinet replaced the king more often during the first half of the twentieth century, and as such gained importance within government. As the Constitution requires the king to exercise his powers through the ministers, the prime minister became reckoned as the country&#x27;s most important political figure and &quot;de facto&quot; chief executive. Nevertheless, given his newly acquired prominence, as a member of the Cabinet the head of Cabinet continued to lead a ministerial department.

The title of &quot;Prime Minister&quot; or &quot;Premier&quot; was used for the first time in 1918 in official documents and it is at this time that the position was assigned to its own cabinet. Only in 1970 the title was incorporated in the Belgian Constitution with the first state reform.

== Function ==
Besides coordinating government policies, the prime minister is responsible for the proper execution of the coalition agreement. The prime minister also presides at meetings of the Council of Ministers and manages conflicts of competencies between the ministers. In addition, the prime minister represents the government coalition in public, both at home and abroad. It is the prime minister who maintains contact with the king and presents the government policy statement in the Parliament. The prime minister can also ask Parliament for a vote of confidence, which can even lead to the government&#x27;s resignation in the case of a constructive vote of no confidence. Unless the prime minister resigns because of a personal matter, the whole government resigns with the prime minister&#x27;s resignation. The prime minister also represents Belgium in the various international organisations, alongside the minister of foreign affairs. Due to the state reform, the prime minister acquired a number of additional tasks, such as keeping in check the relations between the different regions and communities of the country, and presiding at the deliberative committee that consists of the governmental representatives of all the federal entities.

It is expected, though not required, that the prime minister be fluent in both French and Dutch.

== Appointment ==
The day after the federal elections, the incumbent prime minister offers the resignation of his government to the king. The king then asks the resigning government to continue as a caretaker government until a new government is formed. The king then consults a number of prominent politicians in order to ascertain the different possibilities of forming a government. He usually consults the presidents of the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate, the most important political parties, and other people of political and socio-economic importance. After the consultations, the king appoints an &quot;informateur&quot; who is in charge of collecting information from the different political parties about their demands for formation of a new government. After these consultations, the &quot;informateur&quot; reports to the king so that the king can find a suitable &quot;formateur&quot;, who is responsible for forming the government. Usually, it is the &quot;formateur&quot; of the federal government who then becomes prime minister.

It usually takes several months of negotiations before the &quot;formateur&quot; is ready to accept a formal royal invitation to form a government. Per the Constitution, the king&#x27;s acts are only valid with the countersignature of a minister. For this reason, the outgoing prime minister countersigns the Act of Appointment of the new prime minister, and the new prime minister countersigns the Act of Resignation of the resigning prime minister. The king then appoints the other ministers and secretaries of state of the federal government, and their Acts of Appointment are countersigned by the prime minister.

== Official office ==
The official office of the prime minister is located at 16 Rue de la Loi (Wetstraat in Dutch, or &quot;Law Street&quot; in translation) among many notable Belgian government and European Union buildings in the centre of Brussels and around Brussels Park. The residence includes the Belgian Federal Cabinet, the Chancellery and the Council of Ministers. It functions as the nerve center of Belgian politics. The building was originally erected as the so-called &quot;Refuge House&quot; by the Saint Gertrude Abbey of Leuven. It was designed by the Belgian-Austrian architect Louis Joseph Montoyer. At the time of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815–1830), the building was planned to be used as the location for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1830 it was purchased by Prince Eugène of Ligne, and from 1944, the building became state property, after which it was furnished to function as a meeting place for the prime minister and his cabinet.

<text>Johann Samuel Ersch (23 June 1766 – 16 January 1828) was a German bibliographer, generally regarded as the founder of German bibliography.

==Biography==
He was born in Großglogau (now Głogów), in Silesia. In 1785 he entered the University of Halle with the view of studying theology; but soon became more interested in history, bibliography and geography. At Halle he made the acquaintance of Johann Ernst Fabri, professor of geography; and when Fabri was made professor of history and statistics at the University of Jena, Ersch accompanied him there, and helped him in the preparation of several works.
In 1788 he published the Verzeichnis aller anonymischen Schriften, as a supplement to the 4th edition of Johann Georg Meusel&#x27;s Gelehrtes Deutschland. The researches required for this work suggested to him the preparation of a Repertorium über die allgemeinen deutschen Journale und andere periodische Sammlungen für Erdbeschreibung, Geschichte, und die damit verwandten Wissenschaften (Lemgo, 1790–92). The fame which this publication acquired for him led to his being engaged by Christian Gottfried Schütz and Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland to prepare an Allgemeines Repertorium der Literatur, published in eight volumes (Jena and Weimar, 1793–1809), which condensed the literary productions of fifteen years (1785–1800),[2] and included an account not merely of the books published during that period, but also of articles in periodicals and magazines, and even of the criticisms to which each book had been subjected.[3]

While engaged in this great work Ersch also planned La France littéraire, which was published at Hamburg in five volumes, from 1797 to 1806. In 1795 he went to Hamburg to edit the Neue Hamburger Zeitung, founded by Victor Klopstock, brother of Gottlieb Klopstock, but returned in 1800 to Jena to take an active part in the Allgemeine Literaturzeitung. He also obtained in the same year the office of librarian in the university, and around 1802 was given the title of professor.[1][3]

In 1803 Ersch accepted the chair of geography and statistics at Halle, and in 1808 was made principal librarian. He here projected a Handbuch der Deutschen literatur seit der mitte des achtzehnten jahrhunderts bis auf die neueste zeit (Leipzig, 1812–14) and, along with Johann Gottfried Gruber, the Allgemeine Encyclopädie der Wissenschaften und Künste (Leipzig, 1818) which he continued as far as the 18th volume. The accuracy and thoroughness of this monumental encyclopaedia made it an indispensable book of reference. He died, aged 61, in Halle.

<doc id="204633" wikidata="Q1142173" url="?curid=204633" title="Fedayeen Saddam">
<text>Fedayeen Saddam () was an Iraqi paramilitary Fedayeen organization loyal to the Ba&#x27;athist government of Saddam Hussein. The group&#x27;s name means &quot;Saddam&#x27;s Men of Sacrifice&quot;. At its peak, they had 30,000 to 40,000 members. The Fedayeen operated outside the law and were not bound by any political structures.

==Irregular forces==
The Fedayeen Saddam was not part of Iraq&#x27;s regular armed forces but rather operated as a paramilitary unit of irregular forces. As a result of this, the Fedayeen reported directly to the Presidential Palace, rather than through the military chain of command. Whilst paramilitary, the Fedayeen were not an elite military force, often receiving just basic training and operating without heavy weapons. In this they were somewhat similar to the &quot;Basij&quot; of Iran or &quot;Shabiha&quot; militia of Syria.

Much like other paramilitaries, the Fedayeen was volunteer based and the units were never given an official salary. As a result, most of the members resorted to extortion and theft of property from the general population, even though the members had access to sanction-evading trade and high quality services (i.e. new cars, hospitals reserved for officials, expensive electronics) and a general standard of living considerably higher than that of the average Iraqi of the time. However, they were ordered not to threaten or harm any government officials. As the group had no overt religious affiliations, it had a mix of Sunni and Shia members. 

The Fedayeen were among the most loyal organizations to the regime of Saddam Hussein and were a politically reliable force against domestic opponents. The militia is directly responsible for some of the regime&#x27;s most brutal acts. The Fedayeen caught the attention of the international community in 2000 when it was reported that 30 prostitutes were beheaded in Baghdad, Basra and other major cities. Their heads were left on the front doorsteps of the prostitutes&#x27; homes as a &quot;deterrent&quot;. Another report revealed that the militia executed eight prisoners on charges of defacing several murals depicting Saddam Hussein. Another example of Fedayeen&#x27;s brutality was in the spring of 2000, when it was reported that the militia cut out the tongues of four men accused of slandering Saddam Hussein with a pair of shears in Nasiriyah. Then all four were beheaded with a sword.

The Fedayeen played a role in the 2003 war, proving themselves as the most audacious and fanatic fighters on the Iraqi side. They resisted the American-led invasion by conducting some of the most deadly attacks on U.S. forces, including suicide attacks.

==History==

===Early years===

In 1995 Uday Hussein formed the Fedayeen Saddam with ten to fifteen thousand recruits to maintain internal security in Iraq. The Fedayeen fighters tend to come from Saddam&#x27;s hometown of Tikrit or are recruited from his al-Bu Nasir tribe. Uday used the Fedayeen for personal reasons such as smuggling and suppressing opponents.

In 1996 command of the militia was handed to Qusay Hussein when it was uncovered that Uday was diverting weapons to the militia from the Iraqi Republican Guard.

In 1998 the &quot;Ashbal Saddam&quot; (Saddam&#x27;s Lion Cubs) was created to recruit and train young children for membership in the Fedayeen. The Ashbal recruited boys aged 10 to 15 for military training, including firearms training and even more advanced training, such as the use of helicopters in raiding operations and antitank tactics. They also attended lectures on cultural, political and religious subjects.

Before Saddam was removed from power, the force was placed back under Uday&#x27;s control.

===2003 U.S. invasion===
The Fedayeen Saddam did not rise to international attention, however, until the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S.-led Coalition forces. Whereas the Iraqi army and the Republican Guard quickly collapsed, Fedayeen forces put up stiff resistance to the coalition invasion. U.S. strategy was to bypass other cities and head straight to Baghdad. In response, Fedayeen fighters entrenched themselves in the cities and launched guerrilla-style attacks on rear supply convoys. These convoys were attempting but usually falling short of keeping up with the rapid advance to Baghdad. They were attempting to sustain the rapid advance by bringing up food, water, ammunition, medical supplies and mail from back home. These were very lightly armed cargo trucks driving as fast as they could on dirt roads mainly in southern Iraq, after loading supplies in Kuwait. Once they started to get close to central Iraq more and more paved roads were available. They were almost always at least a few days behind. This made the resupply convoys vulnerable to attack. In these trucks were usually low to mid ranking enlisted soldiers with mostly no combat experience. For instance these cargo trucks mainly were only defended by the two rifles the driver and truck commander had. So even with a relatively small force the Fedayeen could attack several of the last trucks in a convoy, or trucks that had lost contact with the convoy. It was easy for the Fedayeen to capture or destroy these isolated poorly defended vehicles. The Fedayeen also used intimidation in an attempt to maintain morale in the Iraqi army and to keep civilians from rebelling. The multinational coalition was forced to turn its attention to the slow task of rooting out irregular forces from the southern cities, delaying the advance by two weeks. 
During the invasion, Fedayeen fighters mostly wielded AK-47 assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, machine guns, and truck-mounted artillery and mortars. They made extensive use of subterfuge in an attempt to blunt the overwhelming technological advantage used by the invading forces.

By the end of the first week of April, Coalition forces had mostly succeeded in rooting out Fedayeen forces from the southern cities. The Shiite population was very un-supportive of the fighters, although many were intimidated. This factor, coupled with overwhelming firepower, quickly gave U.S. forces in the area a decisive edge. This reduced the pressure on the stretched supply lines, enabling the advance to continue. On 9 April, Baghdad fell to U.S. forces with only sporadic resistance by Fedayeen irregulars, foreign volunteers, and remnants of the Special Republican Guard, effectively ending the regime of Saddam Hussein. Tikrit, the last city to fall, was taken on 15 April.

The Fedayeen Saddam was officially dissolved on 23 May 2003, per Order 2 of the Coalition Provisional Authority under Administrator Paul Bremer.

===Iraqi insurgency===

The fall of Baghdad effectively ended the existence of the Fedayeen Saddam as an organized paramilitary. Some of its members died during the war. A large number survived, however, and were willing to carry on the fight even after the fall of Saddam Hussein from power. The de-Ba&#x27;athification campaign sent many former Fedayeen members into the arms of Sunni guerrilla organizations, including jihadist groups such as Jama&#x27;at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad that began to form to resist the U.S.-led occupation, while the Shi&#x27;ite members of the Fedayeen went on to join the Mahdi Army. By June 2003, an insurgency was clearly underway in central and northern Iraq, especially in the area known as the Sunni Triangle. Some units of the Fedayeen also continued to operate independently of other insurgent organizations in the Sunni areas of Iraq. Some Fedayeen members fled to neighboring Syria. On 30 November 2003, a U.S. convoy traveling through the town of Samarra in the Sunni Triangle was ambushed by over 100 Iraqi guerrillas, reportedly wearing trademark Fedayeen Saddam uniforms. Exactly how much influence they had in the resistance, especially following Saddam Hussein&#x27;s capture on 13 December 2003, was a source of controversy. Four former members of Fedayeen Saddam were arrested in the volatile Salah al-Din province on 14 May 2004, for the abduction, transfer, and gruesome beheading of American Nicholas Berg. 

In 2015, Der Spiegel reported that virtually all of the leaders of the Islamic State (ISIS) are officers who had previously served in Saddam Hussein&#x27;s army and intelligence services, including Fedayeen Saddam paramilitary militia.

===Additional roles===
The Fedayeen has been cited as carrying out some of the most brutal acts of the pro-Saddam militias. Fedayeen Saddam committed torture and executions involving beatings, breaking bones, gouging out eyes, throwing people off of high buildings, chopping off fingers, ears and genitals, cutting out tongues, piercing hands with electric drills, ritualized mutilations and amputations. Additionally, they were thought to have acted as enforcers for the Iraqi army in order to prevent desertion. There were also reports of men being executed by being blown up with explosives packed around their bodies. In the last two years of Hussein&#x27;s rule, a campaign of beheadings, mainly targeting women suspected of prostitution and carried out by his elite Fedayeen unit, killed more than 200 people, human rights groups reported at the time.

==Appearance==

The Fedayeen Saddam wore two uniforms, an all black one worn on operations and an all white one worn on parade. They also operated in plain clothes in order to confuse Coalition forces.

A black Darth Vader style helmet was also worn by some of the black-uniformed Fedayeen, as Uday Hussein (commander of the Fedayeen and eldest son of Saddam) was reportedly an avid fan of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The helmet shell was made of fibre glass, with a nylon webbing cradle. Fixed to the right side was a moulded rubber Fedayeen badge, which consisted of a silhouette of Saddam and the motto; &quot;Allah al-watan qa&#x27;ed&quot; (God, homeland, leader).

==Equipment==
The Fedayeen were equipped as light infantry, and were armed with AK-47/AKM assault rifles and RPGs.

<text>The Moonstone: A Romance by Wilkie Collins is an 1868 British epistolary novel. It is an early example of the modern detective novel, and established many of the ground rules of the modern genre. Its publication was started on 4 January 1868 and was completed on 8 August 1868. The story was serialised in Charles Dickens&#x27;s magazine &quot;All the Year Round.&quot; Collins adapted &quot;The Moonstone&quot; for the stage in 1877.

==Etymology==

The Moonstone of the title is a diamond (not to be confused with the semi-precious moonstone gem). It has gained its name from its association with the Hindu god of the Moon, Chandra. It is protected by three hereditary guardians on the orders of Vishnu, and waxes and wanes in brilliance along with the light of the Moon.

==Plot outline==
Rachel Verinder, a young English woman, inherits a large Indian diamond on her eighteenth birthday. It is a legacy from her uncle, a corrupt British army officer who served in India. The diamond is of great religious significance and extremely valuable, and three Hindu priests have dedicated their lives to recovering it. The story incorporates elements of the legendary origins of the Hope Diamond (or perhaps the Orloff Diamond or the Koh-i-Noor). Rachel&#x27;s eighteenth birthday is celebrated with a large party at which the guests include her cousin Franklin Blake. She wears the Moonstone on her dress that evening for all to see, including some Indian jugglers who have called at the house. Later that night the diamond is stolen from Rachel&#x27;s bedroom, and a period of turmoil, unhappiness, misunderstandings and ill luck ensues. Told by a series of narratives from some of the main characters, the complex plot traces the subsequent efforts to explain the theft, identify the thief, trace the stone and recover it.

==Plot summary==
Colonel Herncastle, an unpleasant former soldier, brings the Moonstone back with him from India where he acquired it by theft and murder during the Siege of Seringapatam. Angry at his family, who shun him, he leaves it in his will as a birthday gift to his niece Rachel, thus exposing her to attack by the stone&#x27;s hereditary guardians, who will stop at nothing to retrieve it.

Rachel wears the stone to her birthday party, but that night it disappears from her room. Suspicion falls on three Indian jugglers who have been near the house; on Rosanna Spearman, a maidservant who begins to act oddly and who then drowns herself in a local quicksand; and on Rachel herself, who also behaves suspiciously and is suddenly furious with Franklin Blake, with whom she has previously appeared to be enamoured, when he directs attempts to find it. Despite the efforts of Sergeant Cuff, a renowned Scotland Yard detective, the house party ends with the mystery unsolved, and the protagonists disperse.

During the ensuing year there are hints that the diamond was removed from the house and may be in a London bank vault, having been pledged as surety to a moneylender. The Indian jugglers are still nearby, watching and waiting. Rachel&#x27;s grief and isolation increase, especially after her mother dies, and she first accepts and then rejects a marriage proposal from her cousin Godfrey Ablewhite, a philanthropist who was also present at the birthday dinner and whose father owns the bank near Rachel&#x27;s old family home. Finally Franklin Blake returns from travelling abroad and determines to solve the mystery. He first discovers that Rosanna Spearman&#x27;s behaviour was due to her having fallen in love with him. She found evidence (a paint smear on his nightclothes) that convinced her that he was the thief and concealed it to save him, confusing the trail of evidence and throwing suspicion on herself. In despair at her inability to make him acknowledge her despite all she had done for him, she killed herself, leaving behind the smeared gown and a letter he did not receive at the time because of his hasty departure abroad.
Now believing that Rachel suspects him of the theft on Rosanna&#x27;s evidence, Franklin engineers a meeting and asks her. To his astonishment she tells him she actually saw him steal the diamond and has been protecting his reputation at the cost of her own even though she believes him to be a thief and a hypocrite. With hope of redeeming himself he returns to Yorkshire to the scene of the crime and is befriended by Mr. Ezra Jennings, the assistant of Dr. Candy, the doctor. They join to continue the investigations and learn that Franklin was secretly given laudanum during the night of the party (by Mr. Candy, who wanted to exact vengeance on Franklin for criticising medicine); it appears that this, in addition to his anxiety about Rachel and the diamond and other nervous irritations, caused him to take the diamond in a narcotic trance, to move it to a safe place. A re-enactment of the evening&#x27;s events confirms this, but how the stone ended up in a London bank remains a mystery solved only a year after the birthday party when the stone is redeemed.

Franklin and his allies trace the claimant to a seedy waterside inn, only to discover that the Indians have got there first: the claimant is dead and the stone is gone. Under the dead man&#x27;s disguise is none other than Godfrey Ablewhite, who is found to have embezzled the contents of a trust fund in his care and to have been facing exposure soon after the birthday party. The mystery of what Blake did while in his drugged state is solved: he encountered Ablewhite in the passageway outside Rachel&#x27;s room and gave the Moonstone to him to be put back in his father&#x27;s bank, from which it had been withdrawn on the morning of the party to be given to Rachel. Seeing his salvation, Ablewhite pocketed the stone instead, and pledged it as surety for a loan to save himself temporarily from insolvency. When he was murdered, he was on his way to Amsterdam to have the stone cut; it would then have been sold to replenish the plundered trust fund before the beneficiary inherited. The mystery is solved, Rachel and Franklin marry, and in an epilogue from Mr. Murthwaite, a noted adventurer, the reader learns of the restoration of the Moonstone to the place where it should be, in the forehead of the statue of the god in India.

==Characters==
* Rachel Verinder is the fiery and independent daughter of the Verinder family. Throughout much of the book, she believes that her lover Franklin Blake stole the diamond
* Julia, Lady Verinder (née Herncastle) is her mother, a wealthy widow. She is devoted to her daughter, and summons Sergeant Cuff to investigate the theft of the Moonstone
* Colonel John Herncastle is a professional soldier and the brother of Lady Verinder. He is suspected of foul deeds during the Siege of Seringapatem in India; he gained the Moonstone by unlawful means (namely murder and theft)
* Gabriel Betteredge is a venerable man and the Verinders&#x27; head servant. He bases his personal philosophy around the book &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, and frequently uses quotes from it to apply to different situations. He narrates the first section of the novel, and assists Sergeant Cuff in his investigations
* Penelope Betteredge is the daughter of Gabriel, and is also a servant in the household
* Rosanna Spearman is the second housemaid of the Verinders. A lonely figure, she was once placed in a penitentiary for theft, and so suspected of the theft of the diamond. She is infatuated with Franklin Blake and attempts to protect him; she eventually commits suicide in the Shivering Sands
* Drusilla Clack is a poor cousin of Rachel Verinder and the second narrator of the novel. A comical character, she is an unpleasant, hypocritical meddler who attempts to distribute religious tracts that she does not actually believe in. She idolizes Godfrey Ablewhite
* Franklin Blake is an adventurer and amateur detective. He is also a cousin and suitor of Rachel. It is established that he stole the Moonstone unwittingly under the influence of opium. At the end of the novel, Rachel and Franklin are married
* Godfrey Ablewhite is a philanthropist and lay preacher. He is a cousin of Rachel Verinder who becomes engaged to her in order to steal her fortune; he is the true thief of the Moonstone, and is eventually murdered by Hindu priests anxious to recover it
* Mathew Bruff is the family solicitor and the third narrator of the book. He reveals Godfrey Ablewhite&#x27;s true motives to Rachel Verinder
* Sergeant Cuff is a famous detective with a penchant for roses. He is commissioned by Lady Verinder to solve the theft of the diamond, and despite being later discharged he is able to find the true culprit. He is an early example of the police detective in English crime fiction
* Dr Thomas Candy is the family physician, who loses the ability to speak coherently after recovering from a fever. Offended by Franklin Blake&#x27;s comments on the profession of medicine, he doses him with laudanum as a jest, setting the events of the plot in motion
* Ezra Jennings is Dr Candy&#x27;s unpopular and odd-looking assistant. He suffers from an incurable illness and uses opium to control the pain. His knowledge of this allows him to use opium to reveal the memories of Franklin Blake, solving the mystery. He is the fourth narrator in the book
* Superintendent Seegrave is an ineffective police officer who accidentally insults several members of the Verinder household before Sergeant Cuff is able to take over
* Mr Murthwaite is a noted adventurer who has travelled frequently in India. He provides the epilogue to the story, in which he sees the Moonstone restored to its rightful place
* Septimus Luker is a moneylender. He has at one point possession of the Moonstone, before passing it on to Godfrey Ablewhite
* Lucy Yolland is a neighbour of the Verinders who is the confidential friend of Rosanna Spearman
* The Indian jugglers are three disguised Hindu Brahmins who are determined to recover the diamond.

==Background==
In researching the novel, Collins primarily drew on texts such as Charles William King&#x27;s &quot;The Natural History of Precious Stones and Gems and of the Precious Metals&quot; (1865), Sir David Baird&#x27;s autobiography and James Talboys Wheeler&#x27;s &quot;The History of India&quot; (1867). As well as this, he consulted various explorers to provide him first-hand information about Indian culture in order to increase the veracity of his book. At this early stage, the book&#x27;s title was &quot;The Serpent&#x27;s Eye&quot;.

The final novel was serialised in the periodical &quot;All the Year Round&quot; from 4 January to 8 August 1868, as well as simultaneously in the American publication &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. This period was affected by several difficulties in Collins&#x27; life. His mother, Harriet Collins, died on 19 March 1868, and his presence at her bedside caused the novel to fall behind schedule. He also began to suffer a painful attack of gout, which he described in a preface to the 1871 edition as &quot;the bitterest affliction of my life and the severest illness from which I have ever suffered&quot;. To dull the pain, Collins took large amounts of laudanum, resulting in portions of the novel to be written in a drug-induced haze. He would later comment that he did not recall writing these passages. Considering the substantial role the memory-altering effects of opium have in the plot of the novel, this seems significant. &quot;The Moonstone&quot; was eventually published in book form by William Tinsley on 16 July 1868; it was dedicated to his mother.

==Themes==
A major theme of the novel is the intrusion of imperialism on everyday English life. Lynn Pykett argues that &quot;the main narrative of &quot;The Moonstone&quot; concerns the disruption of the tranquility and order of genteel English life by a colonial legacy.&quot; The events of the plot are set into motion by Colonel John Herncastle&#x27;s unlawful theft of the Moonstone in India, and, in leaving the diamond to Rachel Verinder in his will, he is perpetuating his crime. It is only when the diamond is returned to its rightful owners that the &#x27;curse&#x27; can be lifted. Pykett also comments that the contradictory forces of feminine passion and silence provide the conflict of the novel, &quot;[Sergeant] Cuff is defeated by the silence of women (Rachel and Rosanna), by feminine reticence (Lady Verinder), and the failure of individual women to conform to dominant stereotypes of femininity&quot;.

==Literary significance==
The book is regarded by some as the forerunner of the modern mystery novel and the suspense novel. T. S. Eliot called it &quot;the first, the longest, and the best of modern English detective novels in a genre invented by Collins and not by Poe,&quot; and Dorothy L. Sayers praised it as &quot;probably the very finest detective story ever written&quot;. G. K. Chesterton calls it &quot;probably the best detective tale in the world&quot;. Graham Greene argues that &quot;The Sign of Four&quot; is derived &quot;a little too closely&quot; from it. It was published in 1868, later than Poe&#x27;s short story mysteries &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; (1841) (which introduced the famous locked-room paradigm), &quot;The Mystery of Marie Rogêt&quot; (1842) and &quot;The Purloined Letter&quot; (1845). The plot also shows some parallels with &quot;The Hermitage&quot; (1839), an earlier murder mystery story by the English novelist Sarah Burney: for example, the return of a childhood companion, the sexual symbolism of defloration implied in the crime, and the almost catatonic reactions of the heroine to it. &quot;The Moonstone&quot; introduced a number of the elements that became classic attributes of the twentieth-century detective story in novel form, as opposed to Poe&#x27;s short story form. These include:
* an English country house robbery
* an &quot;inside job&quot;
* red herrings
* a celebrated, skilled, professional investigator
* a bungling local constabulary
* detective enquiries
* a large number of false suspects
* the &quot;least likely suspect&quot;
* a reconstruction of the crime
* a final twist in the plot.

Franklin Blake, the gifted amateur, is an early example of the gentleman detective. The highly competent Sergeant Cuff, the policeman called in from Scotland Yard (whom Collins based on the real-life Inspector Jonathan Whicher who solved the murder committed by Constance Kent), is not a member of the gentry and is unable to break Rachel Verinder&#x27;s reticence about what Cuff knows is an inside job. &quot;The Moonstone&quot; has also been described as perhaps the earliest police procedural, due to the portrayal of Cuff. The social difference between Collins&#x27;s two detectives is shown by their relationships with the Verinder family: Sergeant Cuff befriends Gabriel Betteredge, Lady Verinder&#x27;s steward (chief servant), whereas Franklin Blake eventually marries her daughter Rachel.

A number of critics have suggested that Charles Felix (pseudonym for Charles Warren Adams), in his &quot;Notting Hill Mystery&quot; (1862–1863), first used techniques that came to define the genre.

&quot;The Moonstone&quot; represents Collins&#x27;s only complete reprisal of the popular &quot;multi-narration&quot; method that he had previously used to great effect in &quot;The Woman in White&quot;. The sections by Gabriel Betteredge (steward to the Verinder household) and Miss Clack (a poor relative and religious crank) offer both humour and pathos through their contrast with the testimony of other narrators, at the same time constructing and advancing the novel&#x27;s plot.

The novel was Collins&#x27;s last great success, coming at the end of an extraordinarily productive period in which four successive novels became bestsellers. After &quot;The Moonstone&quot; Collins wrote novels containing more overt social commentary that did not achieve the same audience.

A fictionalised account of Collins&#x27;s life while writing &quot;The Moonstone&quot; forms much of the plot of Dan Simmons&#x27;s novel &quot;Drood&quot; (2009).

==Adaptations==

&quot;The Moonstone&quot; had a great influence on other authors of the time, and books inspired by Collins&#x27; work quickly began appearing. Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; (1870) also features the theme of opium addiction, as well as several Anglo-Indian characters. Anthony Trollope&#x27;s &quot;The Eustace Diamonds&quot; (1873) was written to tap into the thread of popular interest that Collins&#x27; novel caused, with the central plot revolving around the investigation of stolen jewels. A later book inspired by Wilkie Collins is Philip Pullman&#x27;s &quot;The Ruby in the Smoke&quot; (1985).

The novel was made into several silent films during the first few decades of the twentieth century. A 1909 film version, &quot;The Moonstone&quot;, was produced by William Nicholas Selig, although no copies have since survived. Another silent film, &quot;The Moonstone&quot;, was directed in 1915 by Frank Hall Crane.

In 1934, the book was made into a film, &quot;The Moonstone&quot; by Monogram Pictures Corporation. Adapted to the screen by Adele S. Buffington, it was directed by Reginald Barker, and starred David Manners, Charles Irwin and Phyllis Barry.

On 11 March 1945, &quot;The Moonstone&quot; was episode number 67 of the U.S. radio series &quot;The Weird Circle&quot;.

In 1946, &quot;Classic Comics&quot;, the predecessor of &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot;, published in comic book format the novel in issue #30, with cover and artwork by Don Rico. The adaptation was re-published in 1960 with cover and artwork by L.B. Cole.

On 15 April 1947, an adaptation of &quot;The Moonstone&quot; was episode #47 of the NBC radio series &quot;Favorite Story&quot; hosted by Ronald Colman. On 16 November and 23 November 1953, &quot;The Moonstone&quot;, starring Peter Lawford, was broadcast as a two-part episode of the U.S. radio drama &quot;Suspense&quot;.

In 1959, the BBC adapted the novel as a television serial starring James Hayter. 

In 1972, a further BBC adaptation was made, featuring Robin Ellis. This second version was aired in the United States on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;.

In 1972, an Italian TV version of the novel, entitled &quot;La pietra di luna&quot; was broadcast on the RAI, the Italian National Network. It was directed by Anton Giulio Majano, who had already directed adaptations from Dickens, Thackeray, and Stevenson.

In 1974, a German version, &quot;&quot;, was produced by Westdeutscher Rundfunk for television.

In November 1977, Marvel Comics released a comic-book adaptation of the book in issue #23 of the &quot;Marvel Classics Comics&quot; series.

A radio adaptation aired in seven thirty minute episodes on BBC Radio 4 in 1979.

In 1996, &quot;The Moonstone&quot; was made for television by the BBC and Carlton Television in partnership with WGBH of Boston, Massachusetts, airing again on &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;. It starred Greg Wise as Franklin Blake and Keeley Hawes as Rachel Verinder.

In 1998, a fifteen episode radio dramatization, with each episode lasting fifteen minutes, aired on the BBC World Service. This was written by Micheline Wandor.

In 2011, BBC Radio 4 serialised the story in four hour-long episodes in the &quot;Classic Serial&quot; slot with Eleanor Bron as Lady Verinder, Paul Rhys as Franklin Blake, Jasmine Hyde as Rachel Verinder and Kenneth Cranham as Sergeant Cuff.

In 2016, the BBC adapted the novel for a five-part afternoon TV series &quot;The Moonstone&quot; starting 31 October 2016.

In December 2018, Screen14 Pictures, a team that produces fictional stories&#x27; adaption for the web, created a serialised web series of the novel on YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram.

In April 2020, the novel was read in serialized fashion by Phoebe Judge of &quot;Criminal&quot; on her &quot;Phoebe Reads a Mystery&quot; podcast.

<text>Christoph Wilhelm Friedrich Hufeland (12 August 1762, Langensalza – 25 August 1836, Berlin) was a German physician, naturopath and writer. He is famous as the most eminent practical physician of his time in Germany and as the author of numerous works displaying extensive reading and a cultivated critical faculty.

==Biography==
Hufeland was born at Langensalza, Saxony (now Thuringia) and educated at Weimar, where his father held the office of court physician to the grand duchess. In 1780 he entered the University of Jena, and in the following year went on to Göttingen, where in 1783 he graduated in medicine.

After assisting his father for some years at Weimar, he was called in 1793 to the chair of medicine at Jena, receiving at the same time the positions of court physician and professor of pathology at Weimar. During this time, he began a substantive correspondence with Immanuel Kant. In 1798 Frederick William III of Prussia granted him the position director of the medical college and generally of state medical affairs at the Charité, in Berlin. He filled the chair of pathology and therapeutics in the University of Berlin, founded in 1809, and in 1810 became councillor of state. In 1823, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

In time he became as famous as Goethe, Herder, Schiller, and Wieland in his homeland.

Hufeland was a close friend of Samuel Hahnemann and published his original writings in his journal in 1796. He also &quot;joined the Illuminati order at this time, having been introduced to freemasonry in Göttingen in 1783.&quot; He also seems to have professed an interest in Chinese Alchemy and methods of extending longevity.

The most widely known of his many writings is the treatise entitled &quot;Makrobiotik oder Die Kunst, das menschliche Leben zu verlängern&quot; (1796), which was translated into many languages, including in Serbian by Jovan Stejić in Vienna in 1828. Of his practical works, the &quot;System of Practical Medicine&quot; (&quot;System der praktischen Heilkunde&quot;, 1818–1828) is the most elaborate. From 1795 to 1835, he published a &quot;Journal der praktischen Arznei und Wundarzneikunde&quot;. His autobiography was published in 1863.

==Naturopathy==

Hufeland was an early supporter of naturopathic medicine who posited the existence of a vitalistic &quot;life force&quot;, which he believed could be maintained through behavioral and dietary practices. Hufeland was influenced by Hippocrates and promoted what he termed &quot;natural therapeutics&quot; (&quot;naturtherapeutik&quot;). He supported the use of homeopathy.

The term &quot;macrobiotics&quot; was used by Hufeland in his book &quot;Macrobiotics: The Art of Prolonging Life&quot;, that was translated into English in 1797. The book endorsed a program for good health and prolonging life. Hufeland recommended a vegetarian diet. Goethe and his wife took interest in the book. His German disciples gave his dieting and health ideas the name of the Hufelandist movement.

George Ohsawa, founder of the macrobiotic diet based on yin and yang foods, was influenced by Hufeland.

==Marriage and issue==
He first married Juliane Amelung (1771–1845) and married for the second time to Elisabeth Helene Troschel (1777–1862). From his first marriage he had:
*Elwira Laura (born in 1799), married to Karl Wilhelm von Becherer
*Rosalia (born in 1801), married her cousin August Wilhelm Adolph Hufeland
*Elisabeth, married Prince Alexandru Sturdza, scion of the reigning Princes of Moldavia. Through their son Prince Nicolae Sturdza (died in 1832) Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland is great-great-grandfather of Queen Natalie of Serbia and great-great-great-grandfather of King Alexander I of Serbia.

<text>Thomas Michael Disch (February 2, 1940 – July 4, 2008) was an American science fiction writer and poet. He won the Hugo Award for Best Related Book —previously called &quot;Best Non-Fiction Book&quot; —in 1999. He had two other Hugo nominations and nine Nebula Award nominations to his credit, plus one win of the John W. Campbell Memorial Award, a Rhysling Award, and two Seiun Awards, among others.

In the 1960s, his work began appearing in science-fiction magazines. His critically acclaimed science fiction novels, &quot;The Genocides&quot;, &quot;Camp Concentration&quot; and &quot;334&quot; are major contributions to the New Wave science fiction movement. In 1996, his book &quot;The Castle of Indolence: On Poetry, Poets, and Poetasters&quot; was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award, and in 1999, Disch won the Nonfiction Hugo for &quot;The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of&quot;, a meditation on the impact of science fiction on our culture, as well as the Michael Braude Award for Light Verse. Among his other nonfiction work, he wrote theatre and opera criticism for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, and other periodicals. He published several volumes of poetry as Tom Disch.

Following an extended period of depression after the death in 2005 of his life-partner, Charles Naylor, Disch stopped writing almost entirely, except for poetry and blog entries, although he did produce two novellas. Disch fatally shot himself on July 4, 2008, in his apartment in Manhattan, New York City. Naylor and Disch are buried alongside each other at Saint Johns Episcopal Church Columbarium, Dubuque, Iowa. His last book, &quot;The Word of God&quot;, which was written shortly before Naylor died, had just been published a few days before Disch&#x27;s death. His last short story collection, &quot;The Wall of America&quot;, Disch&#x27;s first in over 25 years, was published posthumously several months later.

== Early life ==
Disch was born in Des Moines, Iowa, on February 2, 1940. Because of a polio epidemic in 1946, his mother Helen home-schooled him for a year. As a result, he skipped from kindergarten to second grade. Disch&#x27;s first formal education was at Catholic schools, as evidenced in some of his works which contain scathing criticisms of the Catholic Church. The family moved in 1953 to St. Paul in Minnesota, rejoining both pairs of grandparents, where Disch attended both public and Catholic schools. In the Saint Paul public schools, Disch discovered his long-term loves of science fiction, drama, and poetry. He describes poetry as his stepping-stone to the literary world. A teacher at St. Paul Central, Jeannette Cochran, assigned 100 lines of poetry to be memorized; Disch wound up memorizing ten times as much. His early fascination continued to influence his work with poetic form and the direction of his criticism.

After graduating from high school in 1957, he worked a summer job as a trainee steel draftsman, just one of the many jobs on his path to becoming a writer. Saving enough to move to New York City at the age of 17, he found a Manhattan apartment and began to cast his energies in many directions. He worked as an extra at the Metropolitan Opera House in productions of &quot;Spartacus&quot; for the Bolshoi Ballet, &quot;Swan Lake&quot; for the Royal Ballet, and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, &quot;Tosca&quot; and others for the Met. He found work at a bookstore, then at a newspaper. At the age of 18, a penniless, friendless teenager, he attempted suicide by gas oven but survived due to not having had enough money to pay the gas bill. Later that year, he enlisted in the army. Disch&#x27;s incompatibility with the armed forces quickly resulted in a nearly three-month commitment to a mental hospital.

After his discharge, Disch returned to New York and continued to pursue the arts in his own indirect way. He worked, again, in bookstores, and as a copywriter. Some of these jobs later paid off; working as a cloak room attendant in New York theater culture allowed him to both pursue his lifelong love of drama and led to work as a reviewer of staged drama. Eventually, he got another job with an insurance company and went to school. A brief flirtation with architecture led him to apply to Cooper Union, where he was told he got the highest score ever on their entrance exam, but he dropped out after a few weeks. He then went to night school at New York University (NYU), where classes on novella writing and utopian fiction developed his tastes for some of the common forms and topics of science fiction. In May 1962, he decided to write a short story instead of studying for his midterm exams. He sold the story, &quot;The Double Timer&quot;, for $112.50 to the magazine &quot;Fantastic&quot;. Having begun his literary career, he did not return to NYU but rather took another series of odd jobs such as bank teller, mortuary assistant, and copy editor —all of which served to fuel what he referred to as his night-time &quot;writing habit&quot;. Over the next few years he wrote more science fiction stories but also branched out into poetry; his first published poem, &quot;Echo and Narcissus&quot;, appeared in the &quot;Minnesota Review&quot;&#x27;s Summer 1964 issue.

== Career ==
Disch entered the field of science fiction at a turning point, as the pulp adventure stories of its older style began to be challenged by a more serious, darker style. Rather than trying to compete with mainstream writers on the New York literary scene, Disch published work in science fiction and literary magazines, and began to speak with a new voice. His first novel, &quot;The Genocides&quot;, appeared in 1965; Brian W. Aldiss singled it out for praise in a long review in &quot;SF Impulse&quot;. Much of his early science fiction was published in English author Michael Moorcock&#x27;s New Wave magazine, &quot;New Worlds&quot;, including his sixth novel &quot;Camp Concentration&quot; in two installments.

Disch traveled widely and lived in England, Spain, Rome, and Mexico. In spite of this, he remained a New Yorker for the last twenty years of his life, keeping a long-time New York residence overlooking Union Square. He said that &quot;a city like New York, to my mind, is the whole world.&quot;

Writing had become the dominant focus of his life. Disch described his personal transformation from dilettante to &quot;someone who knows what he wants to do and is so busy doing it that he doesn&#x27;t have much time for anything else.&quot; After &quot;The Genocides&quot;, he wrote &quot;Camp Concentration&quot; and &quot;334&quot;. More books followed, including science fiction novels and stories, gothic works, criticism, plays, a libretto for an opera of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, prose and verse children&#x27;s books such as &quot;A Child&#x27;s Garden of Grammar&quot;, and ten poetry collections. In the 1980s, he moved from science fiction to horror with a quartet set in Minneapolis: &quot;The Businessman&quot;, &quot;The M.D.&quot;, &quot;The Priest&quot;, and &quot;The Sub&quot;.

His writing includes substantial periodical work, such as regular book and theater reviews for &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. Recognition from his award-winning books led to a year as &quot;artist-in-residence&quot; at the College of William &amp; Mary. During his long and varied career, Disch found his way into other forms and genres. As a fiction writer and a poet, Disch felt typecast by his science fiction roots. &quot;I have a class theory of literature. I come from the wrong neighborhood to sell to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. No matter how good I am as an artist, they always can smell where I come from.&quot;

Though Disch was an admirer of and friends with the author Philip K. Dick, Dick wrote an infamous paranoid letter to the FBI in October 1972 that denounced Disch and suggested that there were coded messages, prompted by a covert organization, in Disch&#x27;s novel &quot;Camp Concentration&quot;. Disch was unaware of this letter at the time, and he would go on to champion the Philip K. Dick Award. However, in his final novel, &quot;The Word of God&quot;, Disch got his revenge with a story in which Dick is in Hell, unable to write because of writer&#x27;s block. In return for a taste of human blood, which will unlock his ability to write, he makes a deal to go back in time and kill Disch&#x27;s father so that Disch will never be born, and at the same time to kill Thomas Mann and thereby to ensure that Hitler wins World War II. Disch also referred to Dick in a blog post stating &quot;May he rot in hell, and may his royalties corrupt his heirs to the seventh generation.&quot;

Disch shared his Manhattan apartment and a house in Barryville, New York, with his partner of three decades, poet and fiction writer Charles Naylor. Although he was out as a gay man after 1968 and this facet of his life was occasionally foregrounded in his work (most notably in his poetry and &quot;On Wings of Song&quot;), he did not try to write to a particular community: &quot;I&#x27;m gay myself, but I don&#x27;t write &#x27;gay&#x27; literature.&quot; He rarely mentioned his sexuality in interviews, though he was interviewed by the Canadian gay periodical &quot;The Body Politic&quot; in 1981. After Naylor&#x27;s death in 2005, Disch had to abandon the house, as well as fight attempts to evict him from his rent controlled apartment, and he became steadily more depressed. He wrote on a LiveJournal account from April 2006 until his death, in which he posted poetry and journal entries. Shortly before Disch&#x27;s death, in September and October 2007 literary critic Peter Swirski conducted email interviews with Disch concerning his novels &quot;The M.D. A Horror Story&quot; and &quot;334&quot;. Excerpts from these exchanges were published in Swirski&#x27;s 2010 study &quot;Literature, Analytically Speaking&quot; – Chapter 7 is mostly on &quot;The M.D.&quot; – with Disch responding to questions with wit and irony.

Disch was an outspoken atheist as well as a satirist; his last novel &quot;The Word of God&quot; was published by Tachyon Publications in the summer of 2008. His final published work, the posthumous story collection &quot;The Wall of America&quot;, contains speculative fiction from the last half of Disch&#x27;s career. Most of his literary short fiction was not collected after 1976 (although a story from &quot;The Hudson Review&quot; was collected in 2008). Right up to the end of his life, he maintained an active blog notable for its wit.

===Computer game design===
In 1986, Disch collaborated with New Jersey software company Cognetics Corporation and games publisher Electronic Arts to create the interactive fiction game &quot;Amnesia&quot; for the Commodore 64, IBM PC compatibles, and Apple II computers. The game, based on technology pioneered by Cognetics&#x27; Charles Kreitzberg, was produced by Don Daglow and programmed by Kevin Bentley. It showcased Disch&#x27;s vivid writing, a stark contrast to other game-programmer-written text adventures of the time, and his passion for the energy of the city of New York. Although the text adventure format was dying by the time &quot;Amnesia&quot; was released and it enjoyed limited success, the game pioneered ideas that would later become popular in game design by modeling the entire Manhattan street map south of 110th St. and allowing the player to visit any street corner in that part of the city in their quest to advance the story. Although the limited floppy disk capacity of the 1980s computers caused much of Disch&#x27;s original text about the city to be cut, many Manhattan sites and people were described with unique loving distortion through the Disch lens. David Lehman singled out &quot;Amnesia&quot; for praise in his essay &quot;You Are What You Read&quot; in &quot;Newsweek&quot; (January 12, 1987). In an interview Lehman asked Disch about the origin of &quot;Amnesia.&quot; &quot;Please don&#x27;t say &#x27;I forget&#x27;,&quot; Lehman said. &quot;It&#x27;s true,&quot; Disch replied. &quot;I forget my own life all the time, so amnesia was a natural subject for me.&quot;

===Theater===
Disch was also known for his work in the theater, both as the critic for &quot;The Nation&quot;, from 1987 to 1993, and as writer of two performance works, his meta-historical stage adaptation of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; and his controversial verse monologue/poem, &quot;The Cardinal Detoxes&quot;. Both plays were commissioned and presented by Jeff Cohen and the RAPP Arts Center in New York&#x27;s Alphabet City. &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; not only told the story of the famous Biblical novel but delved into the life and times of its author, General Lew Wallace. Disch proffers the theory that Wallace penned &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, in part, to assuage his guilt over his role in the execution of Mary Surratt. In its world-premiere performance at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore in 1989, it was chosen as a Critics&#x27; Choice by &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

&quot;The Cardinal Detoxes&quot; had a simple conceit: a Catholic bishop has committed vehicular homicide while driving intoxicated and is imprisoned in a monastic &quot;drying tank&quot; where he is sure he is being bugged by the higher-ups. So he attempts to negotiate his release by black-mailing the Church with all of its dirty secrets, big and small. The play was performed at RAPP, located in the former Most Holy Redeemer School, and drew a cease and desist order from the Catholic Archdiocese of New York. An article written by &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Mervyn Rothstein got picked up around the world on the AP wire and the play became one of the most notable censorship controversies of the 1990s. After the American Civil Liberties Union declined to take the case, Disch and RAPP were represented by William Kunstler and Ron Kuby, and the Archdiocese lost in court. Their response was to lock the theater out of their building and have the director jailed. Fortunately, &quot;The Cardinal Detoxes&quot; became as well known for its literary merits as for its controversy. It was selected for the compilations &quot;Best American Poetry 1994&quot; and &quot;Best of The Best American Poetry 1988–1997&quot;.

In 1985, his short story &quot;The Squirrel Cage&quot;, included in his book &quot;Fun With Your New Head&quot;, was adapted for the stage by Robin Willoughby of Buffalo, New York. Music was composed by Tim Kloth. A single character is held captive by some unknown entity. Law enforcement? Foreign country? Aliens? Is he there for punishment, examination, or entertainment? The performer is surrounded on stage by an unseen and unheard (by him) circle of musicians who play in reaction to his musings.

===Poetry===
Disch&#x27;s first published poems, under the byline Tom Disch, were written alongside the stories and novels which made his name in the 1960s. His poetry includes experiments within traditional forms, such as a collaborative sonnet cycle &quot;Highway Sandwiches&quot; with Marilyn Hacker and Charles Platt and &quot;Haikus of an AmPart&quot;, while others like &quot;The Dark Old House&quot; mix stricter and freer form.

Disch&#x27;s reputation as a poet was solidified by a 1989 midcareer retrospective collection, titled &quot;Yes, Let&#x27;s&quot;. A book of new poetry, &quot;Dark Verses &amp; Light&quot;, followed in 1991. In 1995 and 2002, Disch published two collections of poetry criticism. He continued to regularly publish poetry in magazines and journals such as &quot;Poetry&quot;, &quot;Light&quot;, &quot;Paris Review&quot;, &quot;Partisan Review&quot;, &quot;Parnassus: Poetry in Review&quot; and even &quot;Theology Today&quot; (perhaps an odd choice for a long-lapsed Catholic). Disch&#x27;s poems were anthologized in four editions of &quot;The Best American Poetry&quot; —those edited by John Ashbery, Jorie Graham, A. R. Ammons, and John Hollander. Disch published two collections of poetry criticism, &quot;The Castle of Indolence: On Poetry, Poets, and Poetasters&quot; and &quot;The Castle of Perseverance: Job Opportunities in Contemporary Poetry&quot;. His poetry criticism focuses on what makes poetry work, what makes it popular, and how poetry can re-establish its place in modern popular culture.

Near the end of his life he stopped submitting poetry to literary journals unless the journals asked for his contributions. He preferred to publish his poems in his LiveJournal account. In an interview ten days before his death, Disch said, &quot;I write poetry because I think it is the hardest thing I can do well. And so I simply enjoy the doing of it, as an equestrian enjoys spending time on a good horse. Poetry is my good horse.&quot;

<text>The provinces of Thailand are administrative divisions of the government of Thailand. The country is divided into 76 provinces (, , ) proper, with one additional special administrative area (the capital, Bangkok). They are the primary local government units and act as juristic persons. They are divided into amphoe (districts) which are further divided into tambon (sub districts), the next lower level of local government.

All provinces form part of the partially devolved central government, or the regional government (ราชการส่วนภูมิภาค &quot;ratchakan suan phumiphak&quot;). Majority of public services, including police, prison, transport, public relation and others are still overseen and managed by the province on behalf of the central government. In 1938–1996, the Royal Thai Government proposed that each province should have a council, elected from people resided within that province. The council acts as an advisory and auditing body to the governor (ผู้ว่าราชการจังหวัด &quot;phu wa ratchakan changwat&quot;), who is appointed by the central government. In 1997, each province has its own provincial administrative organization (องค์การบริหารส่วนจังหวัด &quot;ongkan borihan suan changwat&quot;), presided over by the president. The PAO manages some public services related to the province. It was expected that the PAO president will become the elected governor (instead of a centrally-appointed one), but the full devolution of the government has not happened. The PAO as well as other municipalities form part of the local self-governing government (ราชการส่วนท้องถิ่น &quot;ratchakan suan thongthin&quot;).

Bangkok, the sole special administrative area, combines the tasks of the provinces with that of a municipality, including having an elected governor. The average area of the 76 provinces of Thailand plus Bangkok is about , while its average population of all 77 divisions of Thailand is about 908,064 people.

==76 provinces in Thailand==

* The total population of Thailand is 65,951,000 as of December 2024.
* The total land area of Thailand is 517,646 km2 in 2013.
* The total land area of Chiang Mai province is 22,311 sq.km
* HS – Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System.
* FIPS code is replaced on 31 December 2014 with ISO 3166.

==Governance==
Thailand&#x27;s national government organisation is divided into three types: central government (ministries, bureaus and departments), provincial government (provinces and districts) and local government (Bangkok, Pattaya, provincial administrative organisations, etc.).

A province, as part of the provincial government, is administered by a governor (ผู้ว่าราชการจังหวัด) who is appointed by the Minister of Interior. Bangkok, as part of the local government, is administered by a corporation called Bangkok Metropolitan Administration. The corporation is led by the Governor of Bangkok (ผู้ว่าราชการกรุงเทพมหานคร) who is directly elected by the citizens of Bangkok.

The provinces are named after their original main city, which may not necessarily still be the most populous city within the province today. Also, in several provinces the administration has been moved into a new building outside the city.

==History==

===Before 1892===
Many provinces date back to semi-independent local chiefdoms or kingdoms, which made up the Ayutthaya Kingdom. The provinces were created around a capital city (&quot;mueang&quot;), and included surrounding villages or satellite towns. The provinces were administered either by a governor, who was appointed by the king or by a local ruling family, who were descendants of the old kings and princes of that area and had been given this privilege by the central king. De facto the king did not have much choice but to choose someone from the local nobility or an economically strong man, as against these local power groups the administration would have become impossible. The governor was not paid by the king, but instead financed himself and his administration by imposing local taxes himself. Every province was required to send an annual tribute to Bangkok.

The provinces were divided into four different classes. The first-class were the border provinces. The second-class were those that once had their own princely house. Third-class were provinces that were created by splitting them from other provinces. Fourth-class were provinces near the capital. Additionally tributary states like the principalities of Lan Na, the Laotian kingdoms of Vientiane and Luang Prabang, Cambodia, or the Malay sultanate Kedah were also part of the country, but with more autonomy than the provinces. In this Mandala system the semi-independent countries sometimes were tributary to more than one country.

New provinces were created when the population of an area outgrew the administration, but also for political reasons. If a governor became too dominant in a region former satellite cities were elevated to provincial status, as was the case with Maha Sarakham province.

Reforms of the provincial administration started in the 1870s under increased pressure from the colonial states of the United Kingdom and France. Agents were sent, especially to border areas, to impose more control on the provinces or tributary states.

===Administrative reform of 1892===

At the end of the 19th century King Chulalongkorn reformed the central government. In 1892 the ministry, which previously had many overlapping responsibilities, was reorganized with clear missions as in Western administrations. Prince Damrong Rajanubhab became minister of the Ministry of the North (&quot;Mahatthai&quot;), originally responsible for the northern administration. When the Ministry of the South (&quot;Kalahom&quot;) was dissolved in 1894, Prince Damrong became Minister of the Interior, responsible for the provincial administration of the whole country.

Starting in 1893 the already existing commissionaireships in some parts of the country were renamed &quot;superintendent commissioner&quot; (&quot;khaluang Thesaphiban&quot;), and their area of responsibility was called a &quot;monthon&quot;. In strategically important areas the monthon were created first, while in other areas the provinces kept their independence a bit longer. Several smaller provinces were reduced in status to an &quot;amphoe&quot; (district) or even lower to a &quot;tambon&quot; (sub-district) and included in a neighboring province, sometimes for administrative reasons, but sometimes to remove an uncooperative governor.

In some regions rebellions broke out against the new administrative system, usually induced by the local nobility fearing their loss of power. The most notable was the Holy Man Rebellion in 1902 in Isan. It was initially a messianic doomsday sect, but it also attacked government representatives in the northeast. The provincial town Khemarat was even burned by the rebels. After a few months the rebellion was beaten back.

After 1916, the word &quot;changwat&quot; became common to use for the provinces, partly to distinguish them from the provincial capital city (&quot;mueang&quot; or &quot;amphoe mueang&quot;), but also to stress the new administrative structure of the provinces.

When Prince Damrong resigned in 1915, the whole country was divided into 19 monthon (including the area around Bangkok, which was under the responsibility of another ministry until 1922), with 72 provinces.

In December 1915 King Vajiravudh announced the creation of regions (&quot;phak&quot;), each administered by a viceroy (&quot;upparat&quot;), to cover several monthon. Until 1922 four regions were established; however, in 1925 they were dissolved again. At the same time several monthon were merged, in an attempt to streamline administration and reduce costs.

===Since 1932===
The monthons were dissolved when Thailand transformed from an absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy in 1932, making the provinces the top level administrative division again. Several smaller provinces were also abolished at that time. During World War II, several provinces around Bangkok were merged. These changes were undone after the war. Also the occupied area from French Indochina was organized into four provinces: Phra Tabong, Phibunsongkhram, Nakhon Champasak and Lan Chang. The current province of Sukhothai was at first known as Sawankhalok. It was renamed Sukhothai in 1939 (which is why the railway system goes to Sawankhalok city and not Sukhothai city). The province, Kalasin, was reestablished in 1947 after having been dissolved in 1932.

In 1972 Phra Nakhon and Thonburi provinces were merged to form the special administrative area of Bangkok, which combines the tasks of the provinces with that of a municipality, including having an elected governor.

Starting in the second half of the 20th century some provinces were newly created by splitting them off from bigger provinces. In 1975, Yasothon province was split off from Ubon Ratchathani. In 1977, Phayao province was created from districts formerly part of Chiang Rai. In 1982, Mukdahan was split off from Nakhon Phanom. In 1993 three provinces were created: Sa Kaeo (split from Prachinburi), Nong Bua Lamphu province (split from Udon Thani), and Amnat Charoen (split from Ubon Ratchathani). The newest province is Bueng Kan, which was split off from Nong Khai effective 23 March 2011.

<text>The FamilySearch Library (FSL), formerly the Family History Library, is a genealogical research facility in downtown Salt Lake City. The library is open to the public free of charge and is operated by FamilySearch, the genealogical arm of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

==History==
The origins of the FSL can be traced to the founding of the Genealogical Society of Utah (GSU) in 1894. Through time the FSL has changed locations within Salt Lake City as follows:
* The GSU&#x27;s first library was located in the office of the Church Historian, 58 E. South Temple Street 
* Church Administration Building, 47 E. South Temple Street (1917–1933)
* 80 N. Main Street (1934–1962)
* 100 S. Main Street (1962–1971)
* Church Office Building, 50 E. North Temple Street (1972–1985)
* 35 N. West Temple Street (1985–Present)

The current building, just west of Temple Square was opened on October 23, 1985, and cost $8.2 million.

In 1938, the GSU began to microfilm records which contained genealogical data from around the world, and today this microfilm makes up much of the library&#x27;s collection. Today the GSU is more commonly known as FamilySearch, and in September 2021, completed digitizing many of its microfilm collections to be shared online. In 2017, the FHL opened a new center for interactive discovery experiences.

On January 10, 2023, the LDS Church announced a name change for the library. The former Family History Library would be known as the FamilySearch Library and family history centers would be known as FamilySearch Centers (FSC).

On April 15, 1999, 70-year-old Sergei Babarin entered the library&#x27;s lobby and began shooting. A security officer and one female patron were killed while several others were injured. One hour and 45 minutes after the shooting began, Salt Lake police shot and fatally wounded Babarin in an exchange of gunfire. Babarin&#x27;s family indicated he had a history of schizophrenia, a claim not corroborated by the Valley Community Mental Health Clinic. This occurred only four months after a separate shooting incident a block away at the Triad Center.

==Purpose==
FamilySearch&#x27;s main purpose is to connect generations of family—past, present, and future—all over the world. The LDS Church believes that families, sealed together through saving ordinances in its temples, are eternal. Family members who die without the opportunity to perform these ordinances for themselves are able to receive them via proxy, which motivates the church&#x27;s emphasis on family history work.

==Services==
The FSL is located in Salt Lake City, Utah. It is the largest genealogical library in the world. The library holds genealogical records for over 100 countries, territories, and possessions. Its collections include over 1.3 million rolls of microfilmed records onsite and access the total collection of more than 2.4 million rolls of microfilmed genealogical records; 190,000 microfiche; 340,000 books, serials, and other formats; 125,000 periodicals; 3,725 electronic resources including subscriptions to the major genealogical websites.

The FSL offers research assistance to help patrons trace their own family history. Professional genealogists and volunteers offer assistance in about 30 languages, which includes reading and translating genealogically relevant documents. The FSL also offers free one-on-one consultations on difficult research problems. Additionally, there are classes on genealogical research topics free to the public and classes available online.

<doc id="204642" wikidata="Q1327790" url="?curid=204642" title="Battle of Chickamauga">
<text>The Battle of Chickamauga, fought on September 18–20, 1863, between the United States Army and Confederate forces in the American Civil War, marked the end of a U.S. Army offensive, the Chickamauga Campaign, in southeastern Tennessee and northwestern Georgia. It was the first major battle of the war fought in Georgia and the most significant US defeat in the Western Theater, and it involved the second-highest number of casualties after the Battle of Gettysburg.

The battle was fought between the US Army Army of the Cumberland under Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans and the Confederate Army of Tennessee under Gen. Braxton Bragg, and was named for Chickamauga Creek. The West Chickamauga Creek meanders near and forms the southeast boundary of the battle area and the park in northwest Georgia. (The South Chickamauga ultimately flows into the Tennessee River about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) northeast of downtown Chattanooga).

After his successful Tullahoma Campaign, Rosecrans renewed the offensive, aiming to force the Confederates out of Chattanooga. In early September, Rosecrans consolidated his forces scattered in Tennessee and Georgia and forced Bragg&#x27;s army out of Chattanooga, heading south. The Union troops followed it and brushed with it at Davis&#x27;s Cross Roads. Bragg was determined to reoccupy Chattanooga and decided to meet a part of Rosecrans&#x27;s army, defeat it, and then move back into the city. On September 17 he headed north, intending to attack the isolated XXI Corps. As Bragg marched north on September 18, his cavalry and infantry fought with Union cavalry and mounted infantry, which were armed with Spencer repeating rifles. The two armies fought at Alexander&#x27;s Bridge and Reed&#x27;s Bridge, as the Confederates tried to cross the West Chickamauga Creek.

Fighting began in earnest on the morning of September 19. Bragg&#x27;s men strongly assaulted but could not break the US line. The next day, Bragg resumed his assault. In late morning, Rosecrans was misinformed that he had a gap in his line. In moving units to shore up the supposed gap, Rosecrans accidentally created an actual gap directly in the path of an eight-brigade assault on a narrow front by Confederate Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, whose corps had been detached from the Army of Northern Virginia. In the resulting rout, Longstreet&#x27;s attack drove one-third of the U.S. army, including Rosecrans himself, from the field.

U.S. Army units spontaneously rallied to create a defensive line on Horseshoe Ridge (&quot;Snodgrass Hill&quot;), forming a new right wing for the line of Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas, who assumed overall command of remaining forces. Although the Confederates launched costly and determined assaults, Thomas and his men held until twilight. Union forces then retired to Chattanooga while the Confederates occupied the surrounding heights, besieging the city.

==Background==
=== Military situation ===

In his successful Tullahoma Campaign in the summer of 1863, Rosecrans moved southeast from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, outmaneuvering Bragg and forcing him to abandon Middle Tennessee and withdraw to the city of Chattanooga, suffering only 569 Union casualties along the way. General-in-chief Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck and President Abraham Lincoln were insistent that Rosecrans move quickly to take Chattanooga. Seizing the city would open the door for the Union to advance toward Atlanta and the heartland of the South. Chattanooga was a vital rail hub (with lines going north toward Nashville and Knoxville and south toward Atlanta), and an important manufacturing center for the production of iron and coke, located on the navigable Tennessee River. Situated between Lookout Mountain, Missionary Ridge, Raccoon Mountain, and Stringer&#x27;s Ridge, Chattanooga occupied an important, defensible position.

Although Braxton Bragg&#x27;s Army of Tennessee had about 52,000 men at the end of July, the Confederate government merged the Department of East Tennessee, under Maj. Gen. Simon B. Buckner, into Bragg&#x27;s Department of Tennessee, which added 17,800 men to Bragg&#x27;s army, a total of 69,800 men, but also extended his command responsibilities northward to the Knoxville area. This brought a third subordinate into Bragg&#x27;s command who had little or no respect for him. Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk and Maj. Gen. William J. Hardee had already made their animosity well known. Buckner&#x27;s attitude was colored by Bragg&#x27;s unsuccessful invasion of Buckner&#x27;s native Kentucky in 1862, as well as by the loss of his command through the merger. A positive aspect for Bragg was Hardee&#x27;s request to be transferred to Mississippi in July, but he was replaced by Lt. Gen. D.H. Hill, a general who did not get along with Robert E. Lee in Virginia.

The Confederate War Department asked Bragg in early August whether he could assume the offensive against Rosecrans if he were given reinforcements from Mississippi. He demurred, concerned about the daunting geographical obstacles and logistical challenges, preferring to wait for Rosecrans to solve those same problems and attack him. He was also concerned about a sizable Union force under Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside that was threatening Knoxville. Bragg withdrew his forces from advanced positions around Bridgeport, which left Rosecrans free to maneuver on the northern side of the Tennessee River. He concentrated his two infantry corps around Chattanooga and relied upon cavalry to cover his flanks, extending from northern Alabama to near Knoxville.

The Confederate government decided to attempt a strategic reversal in the West by sending Bragg reinforcements from Virginia—Lt. Gen. James Longstreet with two divisions from his First Corps, Army of Northern Virginia—in addition to the reinforcements from Mississippi. Chickamauga was the first large scale Confederate movement of troops from one theater to another with the aim of achieving a period of numerical superiority and gaining decisive results. Bragg was now more satisfied with the resources provided, and looked to strike the Union Army as soon as he achieved the strength he needed.

===&quot;River of Death&quot;===
The campaign and major battle take their name from West Chickamauga Creek. In popular histories, it is often said that Chickamauga is a Cherokee word meaning &quot;river of death&quot;. Peter Cozzens, author of &quot;This Terrible Sound&quot;, wrote that this is a &quot;loose translation&quot;. Glenn Tucker presents the translations of &quot;stagnant water&quot; (from the &quot;lower Cherokee tongue&quot;), &quot;good country&quot; (from the Chickasaw) and &quot;river of death&quot; (dialect of the &quot;upcountry Cherokee&quot;). Tucker claims that the &quot;river of death&quot; came by its name not from early warfare, but from the location that the Cherokee contracted smallpox. James Mooney, in &quot;Myths of the Cherokee&quot;, wrote that Chickamauga is the more common spelling for &quot;Tsïkäma&#x27;gï&quot;, a name that &quot;has no meaning in their language&quot; and is possibly &quot;derived from an Algonquian word referring to a fishing or fish-spearing place... if not Shawano it is probably from the Creek or Chickasaw.&quot;

The most plausible etymology for Chickamauga is that it is from the Chickasaw word &quot;chokma&quot; &quot;be good&quot; plus the verb ending &quot;-ka&quot;. The Chickasaw town of Chickamauga was located at the foot of Lookout Mountain.

==Initial movements in the Chickamauga Campaign==
===Planning the Union advance===
Rosecrans faced significant logistical challenges if he chose to move forward. The Cumberland Plateau that separated the armies was a rugged, barren country over 30 miles long with poor roads and little opportunity for foraging. If Bragg attacked him during the advance, Rosecrans would be forced to fight with his back against the mountains and tenuous supply lines. He did not have the luxury of staying put, however, because he was under intense pressure from Washington to move forward in conjunction with Burnside&#x27;s advance into East Tennessee. By early August, Halleck was frustrated enough with Rosecrans&#x27;s delay that he ordered him to move forward immediately and to report daily the movement of each corps until he crossed the Tennessee River. Rosecrans was outraged at the tone of &quot;recklessness, conceit and malice&quot; of Halleck&#x27;s order and insisted that he would be courting disaster if he were not permitted to delay his advance until at least August 17.

Rosecrans knew that he would have difficulty receiving supplies from his base on any advance across the Tennessee River and therefore thought it necessary to accumulate enough supplies and transport wagons that he could cross long distances without a reliable line of communications. His subordinate generals were supportive of this line of reasoning and counseled delay, all except for Brig. Gen. James A. Garfield, Rosecrans&#x27;s chief of staff, a politician who understood the value of being on the record endorsing the Lincoln administration&#x27;s priorities.

The plan for the Union advance was to cross the Cumberland Plateau into the valley of the Tennessee River, pause briefly to accumulate some supplies, and then cross the river itself. An opposed crossing of the wide river was not feasible and so Rosecrans devised a deception to distract Bragg above Chattanooga while the army crossed downstream. Then the Army would advance on a wide front through the mountains. The XXI Corps under Maj. Gen. Thomas L. Crittenden would advance against the city from the west, the XIV Corps under Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas would cross over Lookout Mountain 20 miles south of the city, while the XX Corps under Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook and the Cavalry Corps under Maj. Gen. David S. Stanley would advance even farther to the southeast toward Bragg&#x27;s railroad supply line leading from Atlanta. If executed correctly, this plan would cause Bragg to evacuate Chattanooga or be trapped in the city without supplies.

===Crossing the Tennessee===
Rosecrans ordered his army to move on August 16. The difficult road conditions meant a full week passed before they reached the Tennessee River Valley. They encamped while engineers made preparations for crossing the river. Meanwhile, Rosecrans&#x27;s deception plan was underway. Col. John T. Wilder of the XIV Corps moved his mounted infantry brigade (the Lightning Brigade, which first saw prominence at Hoover&#x27;s Gap) to the north of Chattanooga. His men pounded on tubs and sawed boards, sending pieces of wood downstream, to make the Confederates think that rafts were being constructed for a crossing north of the city. His artillery, commanded by Capt. Eli Lilly, bombarded the city from Stringer&#x27;s Ridge for two weeks, an operation sometimes known as the Second Battle of Chattanooga. The deception worked and Bragg was convinced that the Union crossing would be above the city, in conjunction with Burnside&#x27;s advancing Army of the Ohio from Knoxville.

The first crossing of the Tennessee River was accomplished by the XX Corps at Caperton&#x27;s Ferry, 4 miles from Stevenson on August 29, where construction began on a 1,250-foot pontoon bridge. The second crossing, of the XIV Corps, was at Shellmound, Tennessee, on August 30. They were quickly followed by most of the XXI Corps. The fourth crossing site was at the mouth of Battle Creek, Tennessee, where the rest of the XIV Corps crossed on August 31. Without permanent bridges, the Army of the Cumberland could not be supplied reliably, so another bridge was constructed at Bridgeport by Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan&#x27;s division, spanning in three days. Virtually all of the Union army, other than elements of the Reserve Corps kept behind to guard the railroad, had safely crossed the river by September 4. They faced more mountainous terrain and road networks that were just as treacherous as the ones they had already traversed.

The Confederate high command was concerned about this development and took steps to reinforce the Army of Tennessee. General Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s army dispatched on loan two weak divisions (about 9,000 men) from Mississippi under Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge and Maj. Gen. William H. T. Walker by September 4, and General Robert E. Lee dispatched a corps under Lt. Gen. James Longstreet from the Army of Northern Virginia. Only five brigades (about 5,000 effectives) from two of Longstreet&#x27;s divisions arrived in time for the second day of the Battle of Chickamauga on September 20.

===Into Georgia===
The three infantry corps of Rosecrans&#x27;s army advanced by separate routes, on the only three roads that were suitable for such movements. On the right flank, McCook&#x27;s XX Corps moved southwest to Valley Head, Alabama; in the center, Thomas&#x27;s XIV Corps moved just across the border to Trenton, Georgia; and on the left, Crittenden&#x27;s XXI Corps moved directly toward Chattanooga around Lookout Mountain. On September 8, after learning that Rosecrans had crossed into his rear, Bragg evacuated Chattanooga and moved his army south along the LaFayette Road toward LaFayette, Georgia. The Union army occupied Chattanooga on September 9. Rosecrans telegraphed Halleck, &quot;Chattanooga is ours without a struggle and East Tennessee is free.&quot; Bragg was aware of Rosecrans&#x27;s dispositions and planned to defeat him by attacking his isolated corps individually. The corps were spread out over 40 miles (65 km), too far apart to support each other.

Rosecrans was convinced that Bragg was demoralized and fleeing to either Dalton, Rome, or Atlanta, Georgia. Instead, Bragg&#x27;s Army of Tennessee was encamped at LaFayette, some 20 miles (32 km) south of Chattanooga. Confederate soldiers who posed as deserters deliberately added to this impression. Thomas firmly cautioned Rosecrans that a pursuit of Bragg was unwise because the Army of the Cumberland was too widely dispersed and its supply lines were tenuous. Rosecrans, exultant at his success in capturing Chattanooga, discounted Thomas&#x27;s advice. He ordered McCook to swing across Lookout Mountain at Winston&#x27;s Gap and use his cavalry to break Bragg&#x27;s railroad supply line at Resaca, Georgia. Crittenden was to take Chattanooga and then turn south in pursuit of Bragg. Thomas was to continue his advance toward LaFayette.

===Davis&#x27;s Cross Roads===
Thomas&#x27;s lead division, under Maj. Gen. James Negley, intended to cross McLemore&#x27;s Cove and use Dug Gap in Pigeon Mountain to reach LaFayette. Negley was 12 hours ahead of Brig. Gen. Absalom Baird&#x27;s division, the nearest reinforcements. Braxton Bragg hoped to trap Negley by attacking through the cove from the northeast, forcing the Union division to its destruction at the cul-de-sac at the southwest end of the valley. Early on the morning of September 10, Bragg ordered Polk&#x27;s division under Maj. Gen. Thomas C. Hindman to march 13 miles southwest into the cove and strike Negley&#x27;s flank. He also ordered D.H. Hill to send Cleburne&#x27;s division from LaFayette through Dug Gap to strike Negley&#x27;s front, making sure the movement was coordinated with Hindman&#x27;s.

Entering the cove with 4,600 men, Negley&#x27;s division encountered Confederate skirmishers, but pressed forward to Davis&#x27;s Cross Roads. Informed that there was a large Confederate force approaching on his left, Negley took up a position in the mouth of the cove and remained there until 3a.m. on September 11. Hill claimed that Bragg&#x27;s orders reached him very late and began offering excuses for why he could not advance—Cleburne was sick in bed and the road through Dug Gap was obstructed by felled timber. He advised calling off the operation. Hindman, who had executed Bragg&#x27;s orders promptly and had advanced to within of Negley&#x27;s division, became overly cautious when he realized that Hill would not be attacking on schedule and ordered his men to stop. Bragg reinforced Hindman with two divisions of Buckner&#x27;s corps, which were encamped near Lee and Gordon&#x27;s Mill. When Buckner reached Hindman at 5p.m. on September 10, the Confederates outnumbered Negley&#x27;s division 3 to 1, but failed to attack.

Infuriated that his orders were being defied and a golden opportunity was being lost, Bragg issued new orders for Hindman to attack early September 11. Cleburne, who was not sick as Hill had claimed, cleared the felled timber from Dug Gap and prepared to advance when he heard the sound of Hindman&#x27;s guns. By this time, however, Baird&#x27;s division had reached Negley&#x27;s, and Negley had withdrawn his division to a defensive position just east of the crossroads. The two Union divisions then withdrew to Stevens Gap. Hindman&#x27;s men skirmished with Baird&#x27;s rear guard, but could not prevent the withdrawal of the Union force.

===Final maneuvers===

Realizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces. As he wrote in his official report, it was &quot;a matter of life and death.&quot; On September 12 he ordered McCook and the cavalry to move northeast to Stevens Gap to join with Thomas, intending for this combined force to continue northeast to link up with Crittenden. The message to McCook took a full day to reach him at Alpine and the route he selected to move northeast required three days of marching 57 miles, retracing his steps over Lookout Mountain.

Crittenden&#x27;s corps began moving from Ringgold toward Lee and Gordon&#x27;s Mill. Forrest&#x27;s cavalry reported the movement across the Confederate front and Bragg saw another offensive opportunity. He ordered Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk to attack Crittenden&#x27;s lead division, under Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Wood, at dawn on September 13, with Polk&#x27;s corps and Walker&#x27;s corps. Bragg rode to the scene after hearing no sound of battle and found that there were no preparations being made to attack. Once again, Bragg was angry that one of his subordinates did not attack as ordered, but by that morning it was too late—all of Crittenden&#x27;s corps had passed by and concentrated at Lee and Gordon&#x27;s Mill.

For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. Bragg, learning of McCook&#x27;s movement at Alpine, feared the Federals might be planning a double envelopment. At a council of war on September 15, Bragg&#x27;s corps commanders agreed that an offensive in the direction of Chattanooga offered their best option.

By September 17, McCook&#x27;s corps had reached Stevens Gap and the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Yet Bragg decided that he still had an opportunity. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. Bushrod R. Johnson, he decided to move his army northward on the morning of September 18 and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans&#x27;s army out to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore&#x27;s Cove. The Confederate army was to move beyond the Federal left flank at Lee and Gordon&#x27;s Mill and then cross West Chickamauga Creek. He specified four crossing points, from north to south: Johnson&#x27;s division at Reed&#x27;s Bridge, Walker&#x27;s Reserve Corps at Alexander&#x27;s Bridge, Buckner&#x27;s corps at Thedford&#x27;s Ford, and Polk&#x27;s corps at Dalton&#x27;s Ford. Hill&#x27;s corps would anchor the army&#x27;s left flank and the cavalry under Forrest and Wheeler would cover Bragg&#x27;s right and left flanks, respectively.

==Opposing forces==
===United States Army===
The U.S. Forces Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Rosecrans, consisted of about 60,000 men, composed of the following major organizations:
* XIV Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas, 22,781 present for duty with division commanders Brig. Gen. Absalom Baird, Maj. Gen. James S. Negley, Brig. Gen. John M. Brannan, and Maj. Gen. Joseph J. Reynolds.
* XX Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook, 13,156 present with division commanders Brig. Gen. Jefferson C. Davis, Brig. Gen. Richard W. Johnson, and Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan.
* XXI Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Thomas L. Crittenden, 14,660 present with division commanders Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Wood, Maj. Gen. John M. Palmer, and Brig. Gen. Horatio P. Van Cleve.
* Reserve Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger, 7,372 present with one division commanded by Brig. Gen. James B. Steedman and an attached brigade of Col. Daniel McCook.
* Cavalry Corps, commanded by Brig. Gen. Robert B. Mitchell, 10,078 present with division commanders Brig. Gen. George Crook, and Col. Edward M. McCook.

===Confederate===
The Confederate Army of Tennessee, commanded by Bragg, with about 65,000 men, was composed of the following major organizations:
* The Right Wing, commanded by Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk, contained the division of Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Cheatham, Hill&#x27;s Corps of Lt. Gen. D.H. Hill (divisions of Maj. Gens. Patrick R. Cleburne and John C. Breckinridge) and the Reserve Corps of Maj. Gen. William H. T. Walker (divisions of Brig. Gen. States Rights Gist and St. John R. Liddell).
* The Left Wing, commanded by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, contained the division of Maj. Gen. Thomas C. Hindman, Buckner&#x27;s Corps of Maj. Gen. Simon B. Buckner (divisions of Maj. Gen. Alexander P. Stewart and Brig. Gens. William Preston and Bushrod R. Johnson) and Longstreet&#x27;s Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood (divisions of Maj. Gens. Lafayette McLaws and Hood).
* A cavalry corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler, contained the divisions of Brig. Gens. John A. Wharton and William T. Martin.
* A second cavalry corps, commanded by Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, contained the divisions of Brig. Gens. Frank C. Armstrong and John Pegram.

The organization of the Army of Tennessee into Wings was ordered the night of September 19 upon the arrival of Longstreet from Virginia. Prior to this, the corps commanders reported directly to Bragg.

==Opening engagements==
===September 18===
Bushrod Johnson&#x27;s division took the wrong road from Ringgold, but eventually headed west on the Reed&#x27;s Bridge Road. At 7a.m. his men encountered cavalry pickets from Col. Robert Minty&#x27;s brigade, guarding the approach to Reed&#x27;s Bridge. Being outnumbered five to one, Minty&#x27;s men eventually withdrew across the bridge after being pressured by elements of Forrest&#x27;s cavalry, but could not destroy the bridge and prevent Johnson&#x27;s men from crossing. At 4:30 p.m., when Johnson had reached Jay&#x27;s Mill, Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood of Longstreet&#x27;s Corps arrived from the railroad station at Catoosa and took command of the column. He ordered Johnson to use the Jay&#x27;s Mill Road instead of the Brotherton Road, as Johnson had planned.

At Alexander&#x27;s Bridge to the south, Col. John T. Wilder&#x27;s mounted infantry brigade defended the crossing against the approach of Walker&#x27;s Corps. Armed with Spencer repeating rifles and Capt. Lilly&#x27;s four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, Wilder was able to hold off a brigade of Brig. Gen. St. John Liddell&#x27;s division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder&#x27;s superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert&#x27;s Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 4:30 p.m., considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty&#x27;s loss of Reed&#x27;s Bridge, withdrew and established a new blocking position east of the Lafayette Road, near the Viniard farm.

By dark, Johnson&#x27;s division had halted in front of Wilder&#x27;s position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. Buckner had been able to push only one brigade across the creek at Thedford&#x27;s Ford. Polk&#x27;s troops were facing Crittenden&#x27;s at Lee and Gordon&#x27;s Mill and D.H. Hill&#x27;s corps guarded crossing sites to the south.

Although Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg&#x27;s plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden&#x27;s support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden&#x27;s rear area.

==Battle==
===First day: September 19===


Rosecrans&#x27;s movement of Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas&#x27;s XIV Corps the previous day put the left flank of the Army of the Cumberland farther north than Bragg expected when he formulated his plans for an attack on September 20. Maj. Gen. Thomas L. Crittenden&#x27;s XXI Corps was concentrated around Lee and Gordon&#x27;s Mill, which Bragg assumed was the left flank, but Thomas was arrayed behind him, covering a wide front from Crawfish Springs (division of Maj. Gen. James S. Negley), the Widow Glenn&#x27;s house (Maj. Gen. Joseph J. Reynolds), Kelly field (Brig. Gen. Absalom Baird), to around the McDonald farm (Brig. Gen. John M. Brannan). Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger&#x27;s Reserve Corps was spread along the northern end of the battlefield from Rossville to McAfee&#x27;s Church.

Bragg&#x27;s plan called for an attack on the supposed Union left flank by the corps of Maj. Gens. Simon B. Buckner, John Bell Hood, and W.H.T. Walker, screened by Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest&#x27;s cavalry to the north, with Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Cheatham&#x27;s division held in reserve in the center and Maj. Gen. Patrick R. Cleburne&#x27;s division in reserve at Thedford&#x27;s Ford. Maj. Gen. Thomas C. Hindman&#x27;s division faced Crittenden at Lee and Gordon&#x27;s Mill and Breckinridge&#x27;s faced Negley.

The Battle of Chickamauga opened almost by accident, when pickets from Col. Daniel McCook&#x27;s brigade of Granger&#x27;s Reserve Corps moved toward Jay&#x27;s Mill in search of water. McCook had moved from Rossville on September 18 to aid Col. Robert Minty&#x27;s brigade. His men established a defensive position several hundred yards northwest of Jay&#x27;s Mill, about equally distant from where the 1st Georgia Cavalry waited through the night south of the mill. At about the time that McCook sent a regiment to destroy Reed&#x27;s Bridge (which would survive the second attempt in two days to destroy it), Brig. Gen. Henry Davidson of Forrest&#x27;s Cavalry Corps sent the 1st Georgia forward and they encountered some of McCook&#x27;s men near the mill. McCook was ordered by Granger to withdraw back to Rossville, and his men were pursued by Davidson&#x27;s troopers. McCook encountered Thomas at the LaFayette Road, having finished an all-night march from Crawfish Springs. McCook reported to Thomas that a single Confederate infantry brigade was trapped on the west side of Chickamauga Creek. Thomas told Brannan&#x27;s division to attack and destroy it.

Brannan sent three brigades in response to Thomas&#x27;s order: Col. Ferdinand Van Derveer&#x27;s brigade moved southeast on the Reed&#x27;s Bridge Road, with Col. John Croxton&#x27;s brigade on his right. Col. John Connell&#x27;s brigade came up behind in reserve. Croxton&#x27;s men drove back Davidson&#x27;s advanced cavalrymen and Forrest formed a defensive line of dismounted troopers to stem the tide. Croxton halted his advance because he was unsure of Forrest&#x27;s strength. Forrest requested reinforcements from Bragg and Walker near Alexander&#x27;s Bridge and Walker ordered Col. Claudius Wilson&#x27;s brigade forward about 9a.m., hitting Croxton&#x27;s right flank. Forrest protected his own right flank by deploying the brigade of Col. George Dibrell, which ran into Van Derveer&#x27;s brigade and came to a halt under fire. Forrest sent in Brig. Gen. Matthew Ector&#x27;s brigade, part of Walker&#x27;s Reserve Corps, but without Walker&#x27;s knowledge. Ector&#x27;s men replaced Dibrell&#x27;s in line, but they were also unable to drive Van Derveer from his position.

Brannan&#x27;s division was holding its ground against Forrest and his infantry reinforcements, but their ammunition was running low. Thomas sent Baird&#x27;s division to assist, which advanced with two brigades forward and one in reserve. Brig. Gen. John King&#x27;s brigade of U.S. Army regulars relieved Croxton. The brigade of Col. Benjamin Scribner took up a position on King&#x27;s right and Col. John Starkweather&#x27;s brigade remained in reserve. With superior numbers and firepower, Scribner and King were able to start pushing back Wilson and Ector.

Bragg committed the division of Brig. Gen. St. John R. Liddell to the fight, countering Thomas&#x27;s reinforcements. The brigades of Col. Daniel Govan and Brig. Gen. Edward Walthall advanced along the Alexander&#x27;s Bridge Road, smashing Baird&#x27;s right flank. Both Scribner&#x27;s and Starkweather&#x27;s brigades retreated in panic, followed by King&#x27;s regulars, who dashed for the rear through Van Derveer&#x27;s brigade. Van Derveer&#x27;s men halted the Confederate advance with a concentrated volley at close range. Liddell&#x27;s exhausted men began to withdraw and Croxton&#x27;s brigade, returning to the action, pushed them back beyond the Winfrey field.

Believing that Rosecrans was attempting to move the center of the battle farther north than Bragg planned, Bragg began rushing heavy reinforcements from all parts of his line to his right, starting with Cheatham&#x27;s division of Polk&#x27;s Corps, the largest in the Army of Tennessee with five brigades. At 11a.m., Cheatham&#x27;s men approached Liddell&#x27;s halted division and formed on its left. Three brigades under Brig. Gens. Marcus Wright, Preston Smith, and John Jackson formed the front line and Brig. Gens. Otho Strahl and George Maney commanded the brigades in the second line. Their advance greatly overlapped Croxton&#x27;s brigade and had no difficulty pushing it back. As Croxton withdrew, his brigade was replaced by Brig. Gen. Richard Johnson&#x27;s division of McCook&#x27;s XX Corps near the LaFayette Road. Johnson&#x27;s lead brigades, under Col. Philemon Baldwin and Brig. Gen. August Willich engaged Jackson&#x27;s brigade, protecting Croxton&#x27;s withdrawal. Although outnumbered, Jackson held under the pressure until his ammunition ran low and he called for reinforcements. Cheatham sent in Maney&#x27;s small brigade to replace Jackson, but they were no match for the two larger Federal brigades and Maney was forced to withdraw as both of his flanks were crushed.

Additional Union reinforcements arrived shortly after Johnson. Maj. Gen. John Palmer&#x27;s division of Crittenden&#x27;s corps marched from Lee and Gordon&#x27;s Mill and advanced into the fight with three brigades in line—the brigades of Brig. Gen. William Hazen, Brig. Gen. Charles Cruft, and Col. William Grose—against the Confederate brigades of Wright and Smith. Smith&#x27;s brigade bore the brunt of the attack in the Brock field and was replaced by Strahl&#x27;s brigade, which also had to withdraw under the pressure. Two more Union brigades followed Palmer&#x27;s division, from Brig. Gen. Horatio Van Cleve&#x27;s division of the XXI corps, who formed on the left flank of Wright&#x27;s brigade. The attack of Brig. Gen. Samuel Beatty&#x27;s brigade was the tipping point that caused Wright&#x27;s brigade to join the retreat with Cheatham&#x27;s other units.
For a third time, Bragg ordered a fresh division to move in, this time Maj. Gen. Alexander P. Stewart&#x27;s (Buckner&#x27;s corps) from its position at Thedford Ford around noon. Stewart encountered Wright&#x27;s retreating brigade at the Brock farm and decided to attack Van Cleve&#x27;s position on his left, a decision he made under his own authority. With his brigades deployed in column, Brig. Gen. Henry Clayton&#x27;s was the first to hit three Federal brigades around the Brotherton Farm. Firing until their ammunition was gone, Clayton&#x27;s men were replaced with Brig. Gen. John Brown&#x27;s brigade. Brown drove Beatty&#x27;s and Dick&#x27;s men from the woods east of the LaFayette Road and paused to regroup. Stewart committed his last brigade, under Brig. Gen. William Bate, around 3:30 p.m. and routed Van Cleve&#x27;s division. Hazen&#x27;s brigade was caught up in the retreat as they were replenishing their ammunition. Col. James Sheffield&#x27;s brigade from Hood&#x27;s division drove back Grose&#x27;s and Cruft&#x27;s brigades. Brig. Gen. John Turchin&#x27;s brigade (Reynolds&#x27;s division) counterattacked and briefly held off Sheffield, but the Confederates had caused a major penetration in the Federal line in the area of the Brotherton and Dyer fields. Stewart did not have sufficient forces to maintain that position, and was forced to order Bate to withdraw east of the Lafayette Road.

At around 2 p.m., the division of Brig. Gen. Bushrod R. Johnson (Hood&#x27;s corps) encountered the advance of Union Brig. Gen. Jefferson C. Davis&#x27;s two brigade division of the XX corps, marching north from Crawfish Springs. Johnson&#x27;s men attacked Col. Hans Heg&#x27;s brigade on Davis&#x27;s left and forced it across the LaFayette Road. Hood ordered Johnson to continue the attack by crossing the LaFayette Road with two brigades in line and one in reserve. The two brigades drifted apart during the attack. On the right, Col. John Fulton&#x27;s brigade routed King&#x27;s brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, Brig. Gen. John Gregg&#x27;s brigade attacked Wilder&#x27;s Union brigade in its reserve position at the Viniard Farm. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. Brig. Gen. Evander McNair&#x27;s brigade, called up from the rear, also lost their cohesion during the advance.
Union Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Wood&#x27;s division was ordered to march north from Lee and Gordon&#x27;s Mill around 3p.m. His brigade under Col. George P. Buell was posted north of the Viniard house while Col. Charles Harker&#x27;s brigade continued up the LaFayette Road. Harker&#x27;s brigade arrived in the rear of Fulton&#x27;s and McNair&#x27;s Confederate regiments, firing into their backs. Although the Confederates retreated to the woods east of the road, Harker realized he was isolated and quickly withdrew. At the Viniard house, Buell&#x27;s men were attacked by part of Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law&#x27;s division of Hood&#x27;s corps. The brigades of Brig. Gens. Jerome B. Robertson and Henry L. Benning pushed southwest toward the Viniard field, pushing back Brig. Gen. William Carlin&#x27;s brigade (Davis&#x27;s division) and fiercely struck Buell&#x27;s brigade, pushing them back behind Wilder&#x27;s line. Hood&#x27;s and Johnson&#x27;s men, pushing strongly forward, approached so close to Rosecrans&#x27;s new headquarters at the tiny cabin of Widow Eliza Glenn that the staff officers inside had to shout to make themselves heard over the sounds of battle. There was a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. Wilder&#x27;s men eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.

The Federals launched several unsuccessful counterattacks late in the afternoon to regain the ground around the Viniard house. Col. Heg was mortally wounded during one of these advances. Late in the day, Rosecrans deployed almost his last reserve, Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan&#x27;s division of McCook&#x27;s corps. Marching north from Lee and Gordon&#x27;s Mill, Sheridan took the brigades of Cols. Luther Bradley and Bernard Laiboldt. Bradley&#x27;s brigade was in the lead and it was able to push the heavily outnumbered brigades of Robertson and Benning out of Viniard field. Bradley was wounded during the attack.

By 6 p.m., darkness was falling, and Braxton Bragg had not abandoned his idea of pushing the Federal army to the south. He ordered Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne&#x27;s division (Hill&#x27;s corps) to join Polk on the army&#x27;s right flank. This area of the battlefield had been quiet for several hours as the fighting moved progressively southward. George Thomas had been consolidating his lines, withdrawing slightly to the west to what he considered a superior defensive position. Richard Johnson&#x27;s division and Absalom Baird&#x27;s brigade were in the rear of Thomas&#x27;s westward migration, covering the withdrawal. At sunset Cleburne launched an attack with three brigades in line—from left to right, Brig. Gens. James Deshler, Sterling Wood, and Lucius Polk. The attack degenerated into chaos in the limited visibility of twilight and smoke from burning underbrush. Some of Absalom Baird&#x27;s men advanced to support Baldwin&#x27;s Union brigade, but mistakenly fired at them and were subjected to return friendly fire. Baldwin was shot dead from his horse attempting to lead a counterattack. Deshler&#x27;s brigade missed their objective entirely and Deshler was shot in the chest while examining ammunition boxes. Brig. Gen. Preston Smith led his brigade forward to support Deshler and mistakenly rode into the lines of Col. Joseph B. Dodge&#x27;s brigade (Johnson&#x27;s division), where he was shot down. By 9p.m. Cleburne&#x27;s men retained possession of the Winfrey field and Johnson and Baird had been driven back inside Thomas&#x27;s new defensive line.

Casualties for the first day of battle are difficult to calculate because losses are usually reported for the entire battle. Historian Peter Cozzens wrote that &quot;an estimate of between 6,000 and 9,000 Confederates and perhaps 7,000 Federals seems reasonable.&quot;

===Planning for the second day===
At Braxton Bragg&#x27;s headquarters at Thedford Ford, the commanding general was officially pleased with the day&#x27;s events. He reported that &quot;Night found us masters of the ground, after a series of very obstinate contests with largely superior numbers.&quot; However, his attacks had been launched in a disjointed fashion, failing to achieve a concentration of mass to defeat Rosecrans or cut him off from Chattanooga. Army of Tennessee historian Thomas Connelly criticized Bragg&#x27;s conduct of the battle on September 19, citing his lack of specific orders to his subordinates, and his series of &quot;sporadic attacks which only sapped Bragg&#x27;s strength and enabled Rosecrans to locate the Rebel position.&quot; He wrote that Bragg bypassed two opportunities to win the battle on September 19:

Bragg met individually with his subordinates and informed them that he was reorganizing the Army of Tennessee into two wings. Leonidas Polk, the senior lieutenant general on the field (but junior to Longstreet), was given the right wing and command of Hill&#x27;s Corps, Walker&#x27;s Corps, and Cheatham&#x27;s Division. Polk was ordered to initiate the assault on the Federal left at daybreak, beginning with the division of Breckinridge, followed progressively by Cleburne, Stewart, Hood, McLaws, Bushrod, Johnson, Hindman, and Preston. Informed that Lt. Gen. James Longstreet had just arrived by train from Virginia, Bragg designated him as the left wing commander, commanding Hood&#x27;s Corps, Buckner&#x27;s Corps, and Hindman&#x27;s Division of Polk&#x27;s Corps. (Longstreet arrived late on the night of September 19, and had to find his way in the dark to Bragg&#x27;s headquarters, since Bragg did not send a guide to meet him. Longstreet found Bragg asleep and woke him around 11p.m. Bragg told Longstreet he would take charge of the left wing, explained his battle plan for September 20, and provided Longstreet a map of the area.) The third lieutenant general of the army, D.H. Hill, was not informed directly by Bragg of his effective demotion to Polk&#x27;s subordinate, but he learned his status from a staff officer.
What Hill did not learn was his role in the upcoming battle. The courier sent with written orders was not able to find Hill and returned to his unit without informing anyone. Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge, one of Hill&#x27;s division commanders, was at Polk&#x27;s headquarters, but was not informed that his division was to initiate the dawn attack. At 5a.m. on September 20, Polk was awakened on the cold and foggy battlefield to find that Hill was not preparing to attack. He prepared new written orders, which reached Hill about 6a.m. Hill responded with a number of reasons for delaying the attack, including readjustments of the alignment of his units, reconnaissance of the enemy line, and issuing breakfast rations to his men. Reluctantly, Bragg agreed.

On the Union side, Rosecrans held a council of war with most of his corps and division commanders to determine a course of action for September 20. The Army of the Cumberland had been significantly hurt in the first day&#x27;s battle and had only five fresh brigades available, whereas the Confederate army had been receiving reinforcements and now outnumbered the Federals. Both of these facts ruled out a Union offensive. The presence of Assistant Secretary of War Charles A. Dana at the meeting made any discussion of retreating difficult. Rosecrans decided that his army had to remain in place, on the defensive. He recalled that Bragg had retreated after Perryville and Stones River and could conceivably repeat that behavior.

Rosecrans&#x27;s defensive line consisted of Thomas in his present position, a salient that encompassed the Kelly Farm east of the LaFayette Road, which Thomas&#x27;s engineers had fortified overnight with log breastworks. To the right, McCook withdrew his men from the Viniard field and anchored his right near the Widow Glenn&#x27;s. Crittenden was put in reserve, and Granger, still concentrated at Rossville, was notified to be prepared to support either Thomas or McCook, although practically he could only support Thomas.

Still before dawn, Baird reported to Thomas that his line stopped short of the intersection of the LaFayette and McFarland&#x27;s Gap Roads, and that he could not cover it without weakening his line critically. Thomas requested that his division under James Negley be moved from McCook&#x27;s sector to correct this problem. Rosecrans directed that McCook was to replace Negley in line, but he found soon afterward that Negley had not been relieved. He ordered Negley to send his reserve brigade to Thomas immediately and continued to ride on an inspection of the lines. On a return visit, he founded Negley was still in position and Thomas Wood&#x27;s division was just arriving to relieve him. Rosecrans ordered Wood to expedite his relief of Negley&#x27;s remaining brigades. Some staff officers later recalled that Rosecrans had been extremely angry and berated Wood in front of his staff, although Wood denied that this incident occurred. As Negley&#x27;s remaining brigades moved north, the first attack of the second day of the Battle of Chickamauga started.

===Second day: September 20===
The battle on the second day began at about 9:30 a.m. on the left flank of the Union line, about four hours after Bragg had ordered the attack to start, with coordinated attacks planned by Breckinridge and Cleburne of D.H. Hill&#x27;s Corps, Polk&#x27;s Right Wing. Bragg&#x27;s intention was that this would be the start of successive attacks progressing leftward, &quot;en echelon&quot;, along the Confederate line, designed to drive the Union army south, away from its escape routes through the Rossville Gap and McFarland&#x27;s Gap. The late start was significant. At &quot;day-dawn&quot; there were no significant defensive breastworks constructed by Thomas&#x27;s men yet; these formidable obstacles were built in the few hours after dawn. Bragg wrote after the war that if it were not for the loss of these hours, &quot;our independence might have been won.&quot;

Breckinridge&#x27;s brigades under Brig. Gens. Benjamin Helm, Marcellus A. Stovall, and Daniel W. Adams moved forward, left to right, in a single line. Helm&#x27;s Orphan Brigade of Kentuckians was the first to make contact with Thomas&#x27;s breastworks and Helm (the favorite brother-in-law of Abraham Lincoln) was mortally wounded while attempting to motivate his Kentuckians forward to assault the strong position. Breckinridge&#x27;s other two brigades made better progress against the brigade of Brig. Gen. John Beatty (Negley&#x27;s division), which was attempting to defend a line of a width more suitable for a division. As he found the left flank of the Union line, Breckinridge realigned his two brigades to straddle the LaFayette Road to move south, threatening the rear of Thomas&#x27;s Kelly field salient. Thomas called up reinforcements from Brannan&#x27;s reserve division and Col. Ferdinand Van Derveer&#x27;s brigade charged Stovall&#x27;s men, driving them back. Adams&#x27;s Brigade was stopped by Col. Timothy Robbins Stanley&#x27;s brigade of Negley&#x27;s division. Adams was wounded and left behind as his men retreated to their starting position.
The other part of Hill&#x27;s attack also foundered. Cleburne&#x27;s division met heavy resistance at the breastworks defended by the divisions of Baird, Johnson, Palmer, and Reynolds. Confusing lines of battle, including an overlap with Stewart&#x27;s division on Cleburne&#x27;s left, diminished the effectiveness of the Confederate attack. Cheatham&#x27;s division, waiting in reserve, also could not advance because of Left Wing troops to their front. Hill brought up Gist&#x27;s Brigade, commanded by Col. Peyton Colquitt, of Walker&#x27;s Corps to fill the gap between Breckinridge and Cleburne. Colquitt was killed and his brigade suffered severe casualties in their aborted advance. Walker brought the remainder of his division forward to rescue the survivors of Gist&#x27;s Brigade. On his right flank, Hill sent Col. Daniel Govan&#x27;s brigade of Liddell&#x27;s Division to support Breckinridge, but the brigade was forced to retreat along with Stovall&#x27;s and Adams&#x27;s men in the face of a Federal counterattack.

The attack on the Confederate right flank had petered out by noon, but it caused great commotion throughout Rosecrans&#x27;s army as Thomas sent staff officers to seek aid from fellow generals along the line. West of the Poe field, Brannan&#x27;s division was manning the line between Reynolds&#x27;s division on his left and Wood&#x27;s on his right. His reserve brigade was marching north to aid Thomas, but at about 10a.m. he received one of Thomas&#x27;s staff officers asking for additional assistance. He knew that if his entire division were withdrawn from the line, it would expose the flanks of the neighboring divisions, so he sought Reynolds&#x27;s advice. Reynolds agreed to the proposed movement, but sent word to Rosecrans warning him of the possibly dangerous situation that would result. However, Brannan remained in his position on the line, apparently wishing for Thomas&#x27;s request to be approved by Rosecrans. The staff officer continued to think that Brannan was already in motion. Receiving the message on the west end of the Dyer field, Rosecrans, who assumed that Brannan had already left the line, desired Wood to fill the hole that would be created. His chief of staff, James A. Garfield, who would have known that Brannan was staying in line, was busy writing orders for parts of Sheridan&#x27;s and Van Cleve&#x27;s divisions to support Thomas. Rosecrans&#x27;s order was instead written by Frank Bond, his senior aide-de-camp, generally competent but inexperienced at order-writing. As Rosecrans dictated, Bond wrote the following order: &quot;The general commanding directs that you close up on Reynolds as fast as possible, and support him.&quot; This contradictory order was not reviewed by Rosecrans, who by this point was increasingly worn out, and was sent to Wood directly, bypassing his corps commander Crittenden.
Wood was perplexed by Rosecrans&#x27;s order, which he received around 10:50 a.m. Since Brannan was still on his left flank, Wood would not be able to &quot;close up on&quot; (a military term that meant to &quot;move adjacent to&quot;) Reynolds with Brannan&#x27;s division in the way. Therefore, the only possibility was to withdraw from the line, march around behind Brannan and form up behind Reynolds (the military meaning of the word &quot;support&quot;). This was obviously a risky move, leaving an opening in the line. Wood spoke with corps commander McCook, and claimed later, along with members of both his and McCook&#x27;s staff, that McCook agreed to fill the resulting gap with XX Corps units. McCook maintained that he had not enough units to spare to cover a division-wide hole, although he did send Heg&#x27;s brigade to partially fill the gap.

At about this time, Bragg also made a peremptory order based on incomplete information. Impatient that his attack was not progressing to the left, he sent orders for all of his commands to advance at once. Maj. Gen. Alexander P. Stewart of Longstreet&#x27;s wing received the command and immediately ordered his division forward without consulting with Longstreet. His brigades under Brig. Gens. Henry D. Clayton, John C. Brown, and William B. Bate attacked across the Poe field in the direction of the Union divisions of Brannan and Reynolds. Along with Brig. Gen. S. A. M. Wood&#x27;s brigade of Cleburne&#x27;s Division, Stewart&#x27;s men disabled Brannan&#x27;s right flank and pushed back Van Cleve&#x27;s division in Brannan&#x27;s rear, momentarily crossing the LaFayette Road. A Federal counterattack drove Stewart&#x27;s Division back to its starting point.
Longstreet also received Bragg&#x27;s order but did not act immediately. Surprised by Stewart&#x27;s advance, he held up the order for the remainder of his wing. Longstreet had spent the morning attempting to arrange his lines so that his divisions from the Army of Northern Virginia would be in the front line, but these movements had resulted in the battle line confusion that had plagued Cleburne earlier. When Longstreet was finally ready, he had amassed a concentrated striking force, commanded by Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood, of three divisions, with eight brigades arranged in five lines. In the lead, Brig. Gen. Bushrod Johnson&#x27;s division straddled the Brotherton Road in two echelons. They were followed by Hood&#x27;s Division, now commanded by Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law, and two brigades of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws&#x27;s division, commanded by Brig. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw. To the left of this column was Maj. Gen. Thomas C. Hindman&#x27;s division. Brig. Gen. William Preston&#x27;s division of Buckner&#x27;s corps was in reserve behind Hindman. Longstreet&#x27;s force of 10,000 men, primarily infantry, was similar in number to those he sent forward in Pickett&#x27;s Charge at Gettysburg, and some historians judge that he learned the lessons of that failed assault by providing a massive, narrow column to break the enemy line. Historian Harold Knudsen has described this deployment on a narrow front as similar to the style of the German &quot;Schwerpunkt&quot; in World War II, achieving an attacker/defender ratio of 8:1. Biographer Jeffry D. Wert also cites the innovative approach that Longstreet adopted, &quot;demonstrating his skill as a battlefield commander.&quot; William Glenn Robertson, however, contends that Longstreet&#x27;s deployment was &quot;happenstance&quot;, and that the general&#x27;s after-action report and memoirs do not demonstrate that he had a grand, three-division column in mind.
Longstreet gave the order to move at 11:10 a.m. and Johnson&#x27;s division proceeded across the Brotherton field, by coincidence to precisely the point where Wood&#x27;s Union division was pulling out of the line. Johnson&#x27;s brigade on the left, commanded by Col. John S. Fulton, drove directly through the gap. The brigade on the right, under Brig. Gen. Evander McNair, encountered opposition from Brannan&#x27;s division (parts of Col. John M. Connell&#x27;s brigade), but was also able to push through. The result was what was very soon to be a devastating rout of the Union Army. The few Union soldiers in that sector ran in panic from the onslaught.

At the far side of the Dyer field, several Union batteries of the XXI Corps reserve artillery were set up, but without infantry support. Although the Confederate infantrymen hesitated briefly, Gregg&#x27;s brigade, commanded by Col. Cyrus Sugg, which flanked the guns on their right, Sheffield&#x27;s brigade, commanded by Col. William Perry, and the brigade of Brig. Gen. Jerome B. Robertson, captured 15 of the 26 cannons on the ridge.

As the Union troops were withdrawing, Wood stopped his brigade commanded by Col. Charles G. Harker and sent it back with orders to counterattack the Confederates. They appeared on the scene at the flank of the Confederates who had captured the artillery pieces, causing them to retreat. The brigades of McNair, Perry, and Robinson became intermingled as they ran for shelter in the woods east of the field. Hood ordered Kershaw&#x27;s Brigade to attack Harker and then raced toward Robertson&#x27;s Brigade of Texans, Hood&#x27;s old brigade. As he reached his former unit, a bullet struck him in his right thigh, knocking him from his horse. He was taken to a hospital near Alexander&#x27;s Bridge, where his leg was amputated a few inches from the hip.
 
Harker conducted a fighting withdrawal under pressure from Kershaw, retreating to Horseshoe Ridge near the tiny house of George Washington Snodgrass. Finding a good defensible position there, Harker&#x27;s men were able to resist the multiple assaults, beginning at 1p.m., from the brigades of Kershaw and Brig. Gen. Benjamin G. Humphreys. These two brigades had no assistance from their nearby fellow brigade commanders. Perry and Robertson were attempting to reorganize their brigades after they were routed into the woods. Brig. Gen. Henry L. Benning&#x27;s brigade turned north after crossing the Lafayette Road in pursuit of two brigades of Brannan&#x27;s division, then halted for the afternoon near the Poe house.

Hindman&#x27;s Division attacked the Union line to the south of Hood&#x27;s column and encountered considerably more resistance. The brigade on the right, commanded by Brig. Gen. Zachariah Deas, drove back two brigades of Davis&#x27;s division and defeated Col. Bernard Laiboldt&#x27;s brigade of Sheridan&#x27;s division. Sheridan&#x27;s two remaining brigades, under Brig. Gen. William H. Lytle and Col. Nathan Walworth, checked the Confederate advance on a slight ridge west of the Dyer field near the Widow Glenn House. While leading his men in the defense, Lytle was killed and his men, now outflanked and leaderless, fled west. Hindman&#x27;s brigade on the left, under Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault, crossed the field east of the Widow Glenn&#x27;s house when Col. John T. Wilder&#x27;s mounted infantry brigade, advancing from its reserve position, launched a strong counterattack with its Spencer repeating rifles, driving the enemy around and through what became known as &quot;Bloody Pond&quot;. Having nullified Manigault&#x27;s advance, Wilder decided to attack the flank of Hood&#x27;s column. However, just then Assistant Secretary of War Dana found Wilder and excitedly proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to calm down the secretary and arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.
All Union resistance at the southern end of the battlefield evaporated. Sheridan&#x27;s and Davis&#x27;s divisions fell back to the escape route at McFarland&#x27;s Gap, taking with them elements of Van Cleve&#x27;s and Negley&#x27;s divisions. The majority of units on the right fell back in disorder and Rosecrans, Garfield, McCook, and Crittenden, although attempting to rally retreating units, soon joined them in the mad rush to safety. Rosecrans decided to proceed in haste to Chattanooga in order to organize his returning men and the city defenses. He sent Garfield to Thomas with orders to take command of the forces remaining at Chickamauga and withdraw to Rossville. At McFarland&#x27;s Gap units had reformed and General Negley met both Sheridan and Davis. Sheridan decided he would go to Thomas&#x27;s aid not directly from McFarland&#x27;s gap but via a circuitous route northwest to the Rossville gap then south on Lafayette road. The provost marshal of the XIV Corps met Crittenden around the gap and offered him the services of 1,000 men he had been able to round up during the retreat. Crittenden refused the command and continued his personal flight. At about 3p.m., Sheridan&#x27;s 1,500 men, Davis&#x27;s 2,500, Negley&#x27;s 2,200, and 1,700 men of other detached units were at or near McFarland&#x27;s Gap just 3 miles away from Horseshoe Ridge.


However, not all of the Army of the Cumberland had fled. Thomas&#x27;s four divisions still held their lines around Kelly Field and a strong defensive position was attracting men from the right flank to Horseshoe Ridge. James Negley had been deploying artillery there on orders from Thomas to protect his position at Kelly Field (although Negley inexplicably was facing his guns to the south instead of the northeast). Retreating men rallied in groups of squads and companies and began erecting hasty breastworks from felled trees. The first regimental size unit to arrive in an organized state was the 82nd Indiana, commanded by Col. Morton Hunter, part of Brannan&#x27;s division. Brannan himself arrived at Snodgrass Hill at about noon and began to implore his men to rally around Hunter&#x27;s unit.

Units continued to arrive on Horseshoe Ridge and extended the line, most importantly a regiment that Brannan had requested from Negley&#x27;s division, the 21st Ohio. This unit was armed with five-shot Colt revolving rifles, without which the right flank of the position might have been turned by Kershaw&#x27;s 2nd South Carolina at 1p.m. Historian Steven E. Woodworth called the actions of the 21st Ohio &quot;one of the epic defensive stands of the entire war.&quot; The 535 men of the regiment expended 43,550 rounds in the engagement. Stanley&#x27;s brigade, which had been driven to the area by Govan&#x27;s attack, took up a position on the portion of the ridge immediately south of the Snodgrass house, where they were joined by Harker&#x27;s brigade on their left. This group of randomly selected units were the ones who beat back the initial assaults from Kershaw and Humphrey. Soon thereafter, the Confederate division of Bushrod Johnson advanced against the western end of the ridge, seriously threatening the Union flank. But as they reached the top of the ridge, they found that fresh Union reinforcements had arrived.

Throughout the day, the sounds of battle had reached 3 miles north to McAfee&#x27;s Church, where the Reserve Corps of Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger was stationed. Granger eventually lost patience and sent reinforcements south without receiving explicit orders to do so—the two brigades of Maj. Gen. James B. Steedman&#x27;s division and the brigade of Col. Daniel McCook. As the men marched, they were harassed by Forrest&#x27;s dismounted cavalrymen and artillery, causing them to veer toward the west. McCook&#x27;s brigade was left behind at the McDonald house to guard the rear and Steedman&#x27;s two brigades reached the Union lines in the rear of the Horseshoe Ridge position, just as Johnson was starting his attack. Granger sent Steedman&#x27;s men into Johnson&#x27;s path on the run.

Several attacks and counterattacks shifted the lines back and forth as Johnson received more and more reinforcements—McNair&#x27;s Brigade (commanded by Col. David Coleman), and Deas&#x27;s and Manigault&#x27;s brigades from Hindman&#x27;s division—but many of these men were exhausted. Van Derveer&#x27;s brigade arrived from the Kelly Field line to beef up the Union defense. Brig. Gen. Patton Anderson&#x27;s brigade (Hindman&#x27;s Division) attempted to assault the hill in the gap between Johnson and Kershaw. Despite all the furious activity on Snodgrass Hill, Longstreet was exerting little direction on the battlefield, enjoying a leisurely lunch of bacon and sweet potatoes with his staff in the rear. Summoned to a meeting with Bragg, Longstreet asked the army commander for reinforcements from Polk&#x27;s stalled wing, even though he had not committed his own reserve, Preston&#x27;s division. Bragg was becoming distraught and told Longstreet that the battle was being lost, something Longstreet found inexplicable, considering the success of his assault column. Bragg knew, however, that his success on the southern end of the battlefield was merely driving his opponents to their escape route to Chattanooga and that the opportunity to destroy the Army of the Cumberland had evaporated. After the repeated delays in the morning&#x27;s attacks, Bragg had lost confidence in his generals on the right wing, and while denying Longstreet reinforcements told him &quot;There is not a man in the right wing who has any fight in him.&quot;

The carnage of the war was not to be underestimated. One man said, &quot;I r&quot;emember that next to me was a man, the brother of one of the men who had been instantly killed, and he seemed to delight in seeing our enemies die.&quot;&quot;

Longstreet finally deployed Preston&#x27;s division, which made several attempts to assault Horseshoe Ridge, starting around 4:30 p.m. Longstreet later wrote that there were 25 assaults in all on Snodgrass Hill, but historian Glenn Tucker has written that it was &quot;really one of sustained duration.&quot; At that same time Thomas received an order from Rosecrans to take command of the army and began a general retreat. Thomas&#x27;s divisions at Kelly field, starting with Reynolds&#x27;s division, were the first to withdraw, followed by Palmer&#x27;s. As the Confederates saw the Union soldiers withdrawing, they renewed their attacks, threatening to surround Johnson&#x27;s and Baird&#x27;s divisions. Although Johnson&#x27;s division managed to escape relatively unscathed, Baird lost a significant number of men as prisoners. Thomas left Horseshoe Ridge, placing Granger in charge, but Granger departed soon thereafter, leaving no one to coordinate the withdrawal. Steedman, Brannan, and Wood managed to stealthily withdraw their divisions to the north. Three regiments that had been attached from other units—the 22nd Michigan, the 89th Ohio, and the 21st Ohio—were left behind without sufficient ammunition, and ordered to use their bayonets. They held their position until surrounded by Preston&#x27;s division, when they were forced to surrender.

==Aftermath==

Thomas withdrew the remainder of his units to positions around Rossville Gap after darkness fell. His personal determination to maintain the Union position until ordered to withdraw while his commander and peers fled earned him the nickname &quot;Rock of Chickamauga&quot;, derived from a portion of a message that Garfield sent to Rosecrans, &quot;Thomas is standing like a rock.&quot; Garfield met Thomas in Rossville that night and wired to Rosecrans that &quot;our men not only held their ground, but in many points drove the enemy splendidly. Longstreet&#x27;s Virginians have got their bellies full.&quot; Although the troops were tired and hungry, and nearly out of ammunition, he continued, &quot;I believe we can whip them tomorrow. I believe we can now crown the whole battle with victory.&quot; He urged Rosecrans to rejoin the army and lead it, but Rosecrans, physically exhausted and psychologically a beaten man, remained in Chattanooga. President Lincoln attempted to prop up the morale of his general by telegraphing, &quot;Be of good cheer... We have unabated confidence in you and your soldiers and officers. In the main, you must be the judge as to what is to be done. If I was to suggest, I would say save your army by taking strong positions until Burnside joins you.&quot; Privately, Lincoln told John Hay that Rosecrans seemed &quot;confused and stunned like a duck hit on the head.&quot;

The Army of Tennessee camped for the night, unaware that the Union army had slipped from their grasp. Bragg was not able to mount the kind of pursuit that would have been necessary to cause Rosecrans significant further damage. Many of his troops had arrived hurriedly at Chickamauga by rail, without wagons to transport them, and many of the artillery horses had been injured or killed during the battle. The Tennessee River was now an obstacle to the Confederates and Bragg had no pontoon bridges to effect a crossing. Bragg&#x27;s army paused at Chickamauga to reorganize and gather equipment lost by the Union army. Although Rosecrans had been able to save most of his trains, large quantities of ammunition and arms had been left behind. Army of Tennessee historian Thomas L. Connelly has criticized Bragg&#x27;s performance, claiming that for over four hours on the afternoon of September 20, he missed several good opportunities to prevent the Union escape, such as by a pursuit up the Dry Valley Road to McFarland&#x27;s Gap, or by moving a division (such as Cheatham&#x27;s) around Polk to the north to seize the Rossville Gap or McFarland&#x27;s Gap via the Reed&#x27;s Bridge Road.

===Casualties===

The battle was damaging to both sides in proportions roughly equal to the size of the armies: Union losses were 16,170 (1,657 killed, 9,756 wounded, and 4,757 captured or missing), Confederate 18,454 (2,312 killed, 14,674 wounded, and 1,468 captured or missing). They were the highest losses of any battle in the Western Theater during the war and, after Gettysburg, the second-highest of the war overall. Among the dead were Confederate generals Benjamin Hardin Helm (husband of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s sister-in-law), James Deshler, and Preston Smith, and Union general William H. Lytle. Confederate general John Bell Hood, who had already lost the use of his left arm from a wound at Gettysburg, was severely wounded with a bullet in his leg, requiring it to be amputated. Although the Confederates were technically the victors, driving Rosecrans from the field, Bragg had not achieved his objectives of destroying Rosecrans or of restoring Confederate control of East Tennessee, and the Confederate Army suffered casualties that they could ill afford.

===Reactions and effects===

On September 21, Rosecrans&#x27;s army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. Unable to break the siege, Rosecrans was relieved of his command of the Army of the Cumberland on October 19, replaced by Thomas. McCook and Crittenden lost their commands on September 28 as the XX Corps and the XXI Corps were consolidated into a new IV Corps commanded by Granger; neither officer would ever command in the field again. On the Confederate side, Bragg began to wage a battle against the subordinates he resented for failing him in the campaign: Hindman for his lack of action in McLemore&#x27;s Cove and Polk for his late attack on September 20. On September 29, Bragg suspended both officers from their commands. In early October, an attempted mutiny of Bragg&#x27;s subordinates resulted in D.H. Hill being relieved from his command. Longstreet was dispatched with his corps to the Knoxville Campaign against Ambrose Burnside, seriously weakening Bragg&#x27;s army at Chattanooga.

Harold Knudsen, a combat veteran and historian, contends that Chickamauga was the first major Confederate effort to use the &quot;interior lines of the nation&quot; to transport troops between theaters with the aim of achieving a period of numerical superiority and taking the initiative in the hope of gaining decisive results in the West. He states, &quot;The concentration the Confederates achieved at Chickamauga was an opportunity to work within the strategic parameters of Longstreet&#x27;s Defensive-Offensive theory.&quot; In Knudsen&#x27;s estimation, it was the Confederates&#x27; last realistic chance to take the tactical offense within the context of a strategic defense, and destroy the Union Army of the Cumberland. If a major victory erasing the Union gains of the Tullahoma Campaign and a winning of the strategic initiative could be achieved in late 1863, any threat to Atlanta would be eliminated for the near future. Even more significantly, a major military reversal going into the election year of 1864 could have severely harmed President Lincoln&#x27;s re-election chances, caused the possible election of Democrat nominee George B. McClellan as president, and the cessation of the Union war effort to subdue the South.

===Subsequent events===
The Chickamauga Campaign was followed by the Battles for Chattanooga, sometimes called the Chattanooga Campaign, including the reopening of supply lines and the Battles of Lookout Mountain (November 23) and Missionary Ridge, (November 25). Relief forces commanded by Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant broke Bragg&#x27;s grip on the city, sent the Army of Tennessee into retreat, and opened the gateway to the Deep South for Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman&#x27;s 1864 Atlanta Campaign.

==Battlefield preservation==
Much of the central Chickamauga battlefield is preserved by the National Park Service as part of the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park. The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved 141 acres of the battlefield as of mid-2023.

==In popular culture==
Ambrose Bierce&#x27;s short story &quot;Chickamauga&quot; was published in 1891. French filmmaker Robert Enrico adapted the story for a short film in 1962 as part of a trilogy of films all based on Bierce&#x27;s Civil War fiction.

Thomas Wolfe published his short story &quot;Chickamauga&quot; in 1937. It is included in the 2004 edition of &quot;Thomas Wolfe&#x27;s Civil War&quot;, edited by David Madden.
